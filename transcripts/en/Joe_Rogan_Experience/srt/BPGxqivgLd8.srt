1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,690
Yes,
we're live

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,480
modified brody brody with somebody else.
Who's the other person.

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,680
It was like I copied to people's voices
there.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,920
Brody's more.
Yes.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,020
Yes.
Positive,

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,030
right.
That's Mahlik brody.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,770
Yes.
Buffer.

8
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:26,390
A little drawn out.
Maybe a little buffer in there.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,970
It's time that dude blew his knee out
once doing that.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,090
He blew his acl.
That's how much he explodes and do that

11
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:38,800
jump when he goes,
it's done.

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,660
I'm not bullshitting.
Did he do it live?

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,950
Yes.
Yes.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,800
He popped his fucking acl.
Ow.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,531
Ow.
Fuck.

16
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:46,370
Did he fall or did he just kind of like
catches,

17
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,780
walked it off,
walked it off and then got surgery.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,771
Wow.
Yeah,

19
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:54,970
and he had to be like ginger on it for a
while cause he should do crazy shit man.

20
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,520
You know when you,
when you filmed them doing the buffer,

21
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:01,030
three 60 a lot of people forgot about
that.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,160
He's a madman.
That guy.

23
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,650
Did He,

24
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,470
do you remember what UFC it was 100?
No,

25
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:07,710
no,
I mean it,

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,580
I wonder if he had to do it like,
you know,

27
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:14,210
after he tore it,
like he had to go back on in the ring on

28
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:15,050
a torn acl.

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,750
I think if he did it wasn't for very
long.

30
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,790
I think he just went ahead and got it
fixed real quick.

31
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,290
And then,
you know,

32
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,200
cause if you get,
you get your acl fixed and they'll give

33
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,570
you like these um,
pretty,

34
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,970
uh,
lightweight carbon fiber braces,

35
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:32,010
you could walk around in it like,
okay,

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,540
like it's not cool.
Like it's not,

37
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,520
you don't,
you don't want to go long distances,

38
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:39,690
but they can kind of brace you up pretty
good with a minimal brace.

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,360
Postsurgery you just gotta be real
careful with it.

40
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,920
You know,
you don't want to hurt it again.

41
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,620
Right.
When I hurt my knee recently,

42
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:49,730
I had to go to cvs and get like one of
those knee things for my knee and had to

43
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:52,670
buy like a cane.
And so I have all these like neat to how

44
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:55,340
bad you hurt your knee pretty bad.
I couldn't walk on it to the point where

45
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:57,590
I bought it.
Cane the same name that you had problems

46
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:59,540
with.
What was your original problem with it?

47
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,960
I have this problem where my knee pops
out of place and like it for like a week

48
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:07,400
or so I could almost not even walk on
it.

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,020
It pops back in.
Okay.

50
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,470
It's only happened a few times but it
happened to recently and it was so bad

51
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:14,750
that I couldn't walk.
I had to go to see him.

52
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:18,440
When you go to cvs to buy a cane,
all the canes or like feminine,

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,650
like there's,
they all have glitter on them like a old

54
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:23,600
man came that's gray or something?

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,030
No,
it's all like sparkly blue,

56
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:27,790
sparkly Kane.
What do you think that is?

57
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,380
Is that a marketing move?
Is there like a lot of ladies that are

58
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:31,510
hurting themselves?
I think,

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,630
I don't know.
I think it's just so old.

60
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:33,950
People can see it like they're like,
oh,

61
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:37,100
a sparkly canes or I don't know.
I guess when you get old you don't care

62
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:38,570
about if it's sparkly,
maybe.

63
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,810
I don't know how you can see it.
I have no idea.

64
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,010
It was weird.
Hurting your knees is not good man.

65
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,680
It's not.
And I constantly think about it too

66
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,690
because it's,
it always happens when I'm just like

67
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:53,330
doing something mild like all turned to
the side,

68
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,760
but I'll pivot on it or something that
just pops out.

69
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,130
You probably have at the very least like
something with your meniscus.

70
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,530
It could be like a,
I used to have this thing called a

71
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,950
bucket handle tear and a,
what it would be is,

72
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,400
you know how like a bucket handle like
flip over,

73
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,630
you know,
one way or the other.

74
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,870
Well it gets stuck like flipped like a
piece tears and then it gets stuck like

75
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,630
wedged up.
It's terrible.

76
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,630
Yeah.
And uh,

77
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,850
I had that where it was,
it was bad for a while,

78
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,390
which is kind of give out on me.
And then one day in Jujitsu class,

79
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,930
it just,
it just got wrapped up the wrong way.

80
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,590
Like upside down.
Like my leg got to get yanked in some

81
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,390
way.
My leg completely locked up.

82
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,020
It was brutal,
but it was a pretty quick fix.

83
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,360
It's a way easier fix than a nacl
because with an acl they have to replace

84
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,610
your ligament and it takes a long time
to heal.

85
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,010
But with the meniscus,
like six weeks later you can do Jujitsu

86
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,963
again.
Hmm.

87
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,010
Yeah.
My old roommate had this thing where

88
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,060
like his,
his,

89
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,190
uh,
shoulder would always pop out of place

90
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,120
and he'll be like,
oh my God,

91
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,920
oh out.
But then he would have to like hit it

92
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:03,680
against a wall to pop it back in like
Mel Gibson and lethal weapon and style.

93
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,830
Exactly like that.
That's not good.

94
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

95
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,450
See like stuff like that,
they can fix that.

96
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,830
You should get that fixed.
Yeah.

97
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,970
I don't talk to anymore.
And that surgery suck sucks.

98
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,270
It's all the rehab.
Uh,

99
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,930
yeah.
People that have a serious shoulder

100
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:24,550
surgery or a pretty universal in saying
it sucks depending upon how badly fuck

101
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:25,384
it up.
But like,

102
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,490
you know,
like a guy like Cain Velasquez,

103
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:30,070
he's had it and uh,
he came back from it,

104
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,980
but it took a long ass time before he
was fighting again.

105
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,300
You know,
those,

106
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,200
those are bad surgeries.
Yeah.

107
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,680
And the knee one though,
man,

108
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,240
they might be able to just trim that
shit like you should find out what it is

109
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,700
because if it's just a meniscus tear,
dude,

110
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,080
I'm telling you,
they'd go in there,

111
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:51,820
they scope it,
and if it's not that aggressive,

112
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,770
it's not a gigantic tear,
you'll,

113
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:56,050
you'll be fine.
It's only happened like three or four

114
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:59,260
times my whole life,
so it's like I'm 41 it's fine if it

115
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,090
happens as long as you just don't move
along.

116
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,140
Right.
Exactly.

117
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,710
Kitchen in 10 years,
sedentary lifestyle seminar.

118
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,553
I said,
and Terry,

119
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,880
are you still doing your losing weight
thing?

120
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,900
Yeah,
I just did my first month finished my

121
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:15,901
first month that it was 17.3 pounds.
I think it was incredible in one month.

122
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,500
That's incredible.
Yeah,

123
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,640
it's incredible.
But then I think,

124
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,640
all right,
I still have a 23 pounds.

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,940
Don't think like that.
Think that you're committed.

126
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:25,990
Dude.
That's amazing.

127
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,070
That's a,
that's,

128
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,760
that's a very impressive accomplishment.
It's hard to do.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,830
It is.
I Miss Bread so much though.

130
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:37,240
I haven't had any breads since then.
I haven't had any like cheese or

131
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,370
anything like that.
And I almost snapped the other day.

132
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,990
I was just so hungry.
I was like,

133
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,180
I just can't eat chicken or vegetables
anymore.

134
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,410
Well this is what it's like.
It's like as you get older,

135
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:51,010
your body just sucks more and more a
processing,

136
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,250
the kind of food you love,
your body is like dude,

137
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,150
enough with the fucking split getty,
Jesus Christ.

138
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,600
It's just like glue.
Just it tastes so good though.

139
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:04,341
Oh God.
Damn.

140
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,870
It's good.
One thing I noticed though,

141
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:09,260
immediately all my acid reflex gone,
like all that,

142
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:13,640
like burping and,
and just like stomach acid completely

143
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,290
gone from that.

144
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,300
I don't know if it's the cheese or if
it's the bread or Dotson.

145
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,340
That's fascinating man.
You know,

146
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:25,040
and we had this guy on Mark Sisson the
other day and he's the author of the

147
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,590
primal blueprint and he was talking
about,

148
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:31,160
he had irritable bowel syndrome,
which whenever I hear that,

149
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,740
I don't even know want to know what that
is.

150
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,840
I feel like I have that.
What does it mean?

151
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,101
It means like,
yeah,

152
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,940
ibs gets shitty.
You get diarrhea all the way all the

153
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,780
time,
all day.

154
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,790
I usually have that,
but that's from drinking.

155
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,080
That's not ibs.
That's just

156
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,330
making its way through your veins,
the evil alcohol.

157
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,350
Um,
yeah.

158
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,730
Well he told me that he,
uh,

159
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,270
he cured it all by just eliminating
grains.

160
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,530
He doesn't,
he doesn't take in very many,

161
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:02,660
um,
carbohydrates at all.

162
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,110
Like he doesn't do any breads or pastas
or things like that.

163
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,300
Most of it comes from,
um,

164
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,600
from fruits and vegetables,
mostly vegetables.

165
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:14,300
Right.
And meet like he was,

166
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,560
it was essentially saying that he had
all these issues and obviously what

167
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:22,130
works for one person might not nit
necessarily even be as good for another

168
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:24,560
person.
They say that there's different styles

169
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,120
of human,
you know,

170
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:29,300
that people who are your ancestors come
from specific backgrounds.

171
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,250
Your diet is going to be like,
uh,

172
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,580
some I should find out.
That's bullshit though.

173
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,390
Cause you know,
I've heard that before that that always

174
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,400
seemed like bullshit.
You know.

175
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,300
You know what that was like a recent
study they were talking about it that

176
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,340
there was like,
um,

177
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,260
to,
to eat like your DNA.

178
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,280
You know what I'm talking about?
Remember that thing you would like your

179
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,200
genetic,
yeah,

180
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,270
they were trying to like say,
oh you're a specific type and that type

181
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,350
needs a lot of red meat.

182
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,910
You know,
you're this type,

183
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,450
that type of needs a lot of carbs.
It seems like that makes sense.

184
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,440
Getting some kind of like,
you know,

185
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:10,610
scan of your body of what your body
needs or lacks or needs more of than

186
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,740
other people.
It just makes sense.

187
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:13,280
Right.
Yeah,

188
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,260
totally makes sense.
Especially if you're,

189
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,180
your body's like developed like your
ancestors developed in an area where

190
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:23,690
they needed specific types of foods.
The ancestral diet,

191
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:25,190
that's it.
Should you eat?

192
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:29,180
Look your ancestors is that it?
Pretty recently?

193
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:33,350
This was just at the nlf but I think is
this saying that there's more than one

194
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:36,860
type of person,
the more than one type of diet?

195
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,830
I think this is just talking about a
specific ancient diet.

196
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,900
That's what I think this is.
Cause,

197
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:44,360
I think that's what the ancestral diet
ideas,

198
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,090
the idea mark sisson guy was talking
about,

199
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:53,060
that's really fascinating to me is that,
um,

200
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,130
when you're taking in all these carbs,
you're taking in a lot

201
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,130
of sugar and that when you eliminate
sugar and a eliminate inflammatory

202
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,540
foods,
you are,

203
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,570
your body operates more efficiently.
It's just healthier.

204
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:09,480
It has more resources to,
um,

205
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,410
fight off illness and inflammation and
things like that.

206
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:17,850
It's a fascinating concept.
So I think might not work for everybody.

207
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,200
I don't know what a,
what the fuck do I know,

208
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,910
but I'm going to give it a shot for a
little while.

209
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:21,750
I'm gonna see what it's like.

210
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,220
It's pretty interesting because I,
I,

211
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,840
my,
my diet went from,

212
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,330
you know,
like Mcdonald's to Wendy's everyday to

213
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:30,990
pizza every day.
Like I really had the worst diet ever

214
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:35,991
and now it's just tons of vegetables,
a little protein and I don't feel tired

215
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:39,060
anymore.
I feel like I can feel the food work

216
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,930
almost.
It's,

217
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:43,530
it's interesting how,
how just changing your diet from just

218
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,600
crap too.
That's super healthy.

219
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:48,480
How,
how much you can feel it immediately

220
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:49,580
almost.
Yeah.

221
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,090
It's incredible.
Right.

222
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,360
And working out.
It's getting the doorframes.

223
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,350
I've never had that in my life where
like where I like two hours later I'd be

224
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,610
like,
why am I so happy?

225
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,140
Like I'm like,
like bouncing around.

226
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,460
Ha.
I've never felt that before.

227
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,271
I've worked out,
but for,

228
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,790
I've never felt that,
but for some reason this time around,

229
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,750
I'm just like,
what?

230
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,430
Oh my God,
I'm happy for no reason.

231
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:09,960
I'm happy.
It's a weird,

232
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,210
they've sent it,
they've done studies that show that

233
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,780
depression can be cured just as easily
with the alcohol with,

234
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,790
with alcohol.
Thanks Joe and Matt with the Exercise

235
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,840
Rather.

236
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,530
Yeah.
Um,

237
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,370
then,
uh,

238
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,960
they were,
they were comparing it to people that

239
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:25,870
got on an Ssri and they were saying
they're,

240
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,920
they're pretty similar results and a lot
of people,

241
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,560
people that really started doing a lot
of cardio,

242
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,800
doing a lot of running and things along
those lines.

243
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,390
Like that's like something that's
supposed to be specifically good like

244
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,760
you,
but you need kind of like both kinds of

245
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:44,000
things for your life.
You need like some kind of strenuous

246
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:46,490
stuff,
whether it's body weight stuff,

247
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,870
pushups or something like that or a
anything that just really gets your,

248
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,840
you know,
your strength going and then you need

249
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:55,790
some,
something that's just cardiovascular.

250
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,920
And when you do those things together,
man,

251
00:10:57,921 --> 00:11:00,020
it's just you,
your body's relaxes.

252
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,240
You know,
it's more,

253
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,440
it's more um,
adaptable.

254
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,510
It's more just loose.

255
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,390
Do you have it,
is your bedroom completely blacked out?

256
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:15,540
Like dark and like,
like when you wake up is you see

257
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,940
sunlight when you wake up in the morning
or is there a little,

258
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,650
very little,

259
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,060
I mean,
yeah,

260
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:20,590
why?

261
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,780
I just blacked out my room recently
because I've just got out like I,

262
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,160
my window is like right next to the side
and you're like,

263
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:28,730
when you wake up,
it's just right there is that.

264
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,680
She's done that and hotel rooms and I've
always felt like a creep.

265
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,430
I feel like when you're in vegas or
something like that,

266
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,880
like,
well I always feel like what?

267
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm in a hotel room close like all the
windows and closing all the curtains.

268
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,530
There's something about locking yourself
in a totally dark room.

269
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:46,760
And a strange place.
It's just bizarre.

270
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,190
It is.
And I took like,

271
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:51,290
I found like there was a little crack
where I couldn't like it,

272
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,040
like my blinds didn't fix or anything.
So then

273
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,750
I went to the store,
the hardware store,

274
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,390
and they had like these decals where you
can like put it on your windows.

275
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,590
I made my windows like a stained glass
thinking that way.

276
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,980
So now it's like I have this weird like
blue room that that just closed blue.

277
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,780
But it sucks though.
I had like,

278
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:08,770
I was like,
why did I do this?

279
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:12,340
Because now I have no Ita.
If it's daylight or nighttime,

280
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,400
anytime my,
I remember immigrant,

281
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,690
it's not good.
You need a circadian rhythm thing going

282
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:17,524
on.
Yeah.

283
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,910
Blue.
Did you see that thing that I posted

284
00:12:19,911 --> 00:12:20,960
today?
Um,

285
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,240
I retweeted rather.
It was about,

286
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:24,410
um,
some,

287
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,040
some blue lava.
There's a place in the world that has

288
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,350
blue lava.
Oh Dude.

289
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,550
Why is it blue?
I don't know.

290
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,870
It's fucking Avatar.
That's,

291
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,460
that's Narnia or wherever the fuck those
people are from.

292
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,200
Where were they from?
Unobtainium island or something.

293
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,650
Wait,
where the fuck were they from?

294
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,650
I can't remember the planet.
Maybe we think of something.

295
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:47,190
Have you ever heard the Kentucky blue
people are some somewhat,

296
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,880
yeah.
While I'm looking this up,

297
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,714
I'm gonna look,
okay.

298
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,940
Take it.
Blew people told me about that and I

299
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:52,774
didn't believe him.

300
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,620
The Jersey Devil.
Have you ever heard of the Jersey Devil?

301
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,320
Yeah.
It's supposed to be like a flying demon

302
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,910
that lives in the woods in New Jersey.

303
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,460
Maybe that guy that got poisoning it was
all blue.

304
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,560
I wonder if it,
what's his name?

305
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:06,810
The Russian.
A Russian guy.

306
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,820
And he got placed.
The guy that got poisoned.

307
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,220
Yeah.
His face changed color turned into Papa

308
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:12,210
smurf.
Well,

309
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:14,460
he had all that scar tissue all over his
face.

310
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,930
Remember that too?
That guy.

311
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,040
Well that was the crazy guy that did
the,

312
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,750
um,
that guy was using that colloidal silver

313
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,340
shit.
He was on Oprah.

314
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,860
He passed away recently,
unfortunately.

315
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,130
But um,
that guy specifically,

316
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:34,750
the guy that was on oprah,
that was blue,

317
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:38,470
he passed away recently.
I'm pretty sure I read a story about it

318
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,070
somewhere.
Um,

319
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,040
an entire family.
Oh,

320
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,800
that's different than this is a
different guy.

321
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,520
I wonder if that was their diet to a
blood disorder.

322
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,110
Why don't have to repeat that.

323
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,240
Like we don't speak the same language.
Hello?

324
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,590
Yes.
Blood disorder.

325
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,220
No,
the other guy was d there's the blue

326
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:01,990
lava,
but the other guy was blue because,

327
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:02,824
uh,
he,

328
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,910
he drank colloidal silver every day
cause he thought it would like,

329
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,630
he'll know,
like fix diseases or something like

330
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:11,890
that.
And um,

331
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,170
someone explained,
some scientists explained,

332
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,530
it might've been Neil degrasse Tyson,
I forget who it was,

333
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,920
but they explained why drinking
colloidal silver would have that effect

334
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:25,710
on your body.
I don't think it was neil degrasse

335
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,460
Tyson.
I can't remember who it was.

336
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,350
But anyway,
they went into this scientific

337
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,560
explanation of why drinking coital
silver can permanently stain your body

338
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:36,640
purple.
Like that guy,

339
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,800
he must've drank like massive quantities
of it,

340
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,730
but I forget what the reaction is,
but the reactions permanent.

341
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,810
Hmm.
Like fucking what the fuck Jesus.

342
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,950
Oh my God.
I wonder if the blue is just like,

343
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,030
like almost kind of like a fire that's
around the lava that looks blue.

344
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,320
Kind of like a flame.
Oh,

345
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,140
in this pit thing.
That's,

346
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,801
wow.
No,

347
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:01,634
it isn't.
Okay.

348
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,070
What is that?
It makes no sense.

349
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,833
Hmm.

350
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,380
Awesome.
Cool.

351
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,100
Fumaroles glossed wholesale sulfur gas
staying the surrounding landscape of

352
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,550
bright yellow and ignited sulfur burns
with a blue thing.

353
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,630
Oh Wow.

354
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,650
My name is Ruben.
I'm a photographer and a filmmaker from

355
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:25,580
Liverpool,
UK.

356
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,170
The currently based in Chicago.
The blue flame is too dim to be seen him

357
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:33,230
the day lights.
So I had to wait until dusk for it to be

358
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,780
seen.
And the moonlight was dull enough to

359
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:38,660
show the claims as well as reveal the
surrounding landscape.

360
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,710
I also use long exposures in many of my
images,

361
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,430
which allows for pictures,
which show an extended period of time

362
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,780
rather than a split second.

363
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,290
I'm playing a horrible instrument while
talking,

364
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,680
but wait a minute is actually,
why does that look so fake?

365
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,270
He used well,
like he used a photo trick to that.

366
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:00,110
Is that a real,
no.

367
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:02,950
Real felt photo was that real that we
were just looking at?

368
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,660
Really?
Yeah.

369
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,493
Yeah.
Low Gas.

370
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,180
Why does it look almost like a comic
book ish.

371
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,190
Yeah.
It does want exposure.

372
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,730
It's allowing that fog.
Okay.

373
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,420
Wow.
These pictures are incredible.

374
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,403
Hmm.

375
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,700
This is incredible.
This photographer is fucking amazing.

376
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,310
He has a good camera nowadays.
Nowadays I look at this,

377
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,350
the fact that he's captured this shit,
is he the first guy to ever capture this

378
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:32,650
stuff?
Is this something that people don't

379
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,160
about?
I want to see video of it live though.

380
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,000
See,
that's the problem.

381
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:39,190
I wonder if this is just a photo trick
like yeah,

382
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:41,860
there's a little blue flame to it,
so I might keep the exposure open a

383
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:44,680
little so it looks a little bit more
blue than it would if with your naked

384
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:45,760
eye.
This is video.

385
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,260
Oh yeah,
I guess you're right.

386
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,810
That just looks like fire or something.
Yeah,

387
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,700
that's kind of what he said it was.
It was like the methane.

388
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,730
It's an sulfur head and all our,
yeah,

389
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,070
it's incredible.
It's incredible.

390
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,000
They have software problems here in Los
Angeles.

391
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,280
So you,
you go through some of these,

392
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,390
you know,
places.

393
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,730
It just smells like farts everywhere
because of the sulfur.

394
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,810
Sulfur.
Yeah.

395
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:06,400
I think it's software.
Uh,

396
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,580
in Calabasas when I lived there,
it would sometimes it would just smell

397
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,780
like eggs everywhere and it's because of
sulfur.

398
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,930
We said what it,
what is like a natural software that

399
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:18,190
comes out of the ground and comes out of
it.

400
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:19,330
Yeah.
It comes out of the ground.

401
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,700
And uh,
speaking of that,

402
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,110
like what is up with that gas leak?
Yeah.

403
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,870
Apparently it's horrific.
Yeah.

404
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,370
It's,
it's really bad.

405
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
It's going to take them months to,
uh,

406
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,940
to try to figure it out and uh,
and close it off.

407
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,980
It could get worse.
Right.

408
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,020
They like something could happen.
It seems like somebody could

409
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:39,650
accidentally smoke a cigarette down,
you know,

410
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:43,660
and like we blow up all of my dog.
I don't know how flammable it is.

411
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:45,430
I don't know if it's something like
that.

412
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,050
I don't,
don't know if it's something that's easy

413
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:48,490
to ignite.
I don't know.

414
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,660
But I know it's health concern.
Um,

415
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,320
I mean I think there's a concern too
that it might collapse further.

416
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,260
Wow.
Like,

417
00:17:57,261 --> 00:18:00,960
um,
they don't know exactly how to shut that

418
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:03,930
thing off quick.
It's going to take them some time and

419
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:08,050
some engineering couldn't they just pour
a shitload of concrete all over it and

420
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,110
just walk away and man,
it's gas.

421
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,690
I don't know how they do this.
I really,

422
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:17,691
I couldn't even begin to wrap my mind,
my puny little mind around what kind of

423
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:24,081
knowledge it takes to stop a fucking gas
leak in a pipe natural gas to,

424
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:26,760
it's different than like,
is it car?

425
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:27,900
I'm guy.
I'm kind of asking,

426
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,380
I don't know.
I thought it was type California gas

427
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,240
hasn't dropped like it has all over the
country.

428
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,070
It gets pretty,
it's like almost,

429
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,050
it was under a dollar for a little while
in Ohio.

430
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,730
Well three almost $4.
Some places people love to hear that

431
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:44,080
we're going back to the seventies man is
great.

432
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,780
But what do you think?
Um,

433
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,080
I think it's a methane though,
isn't it?

434
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,330
That's what I would think it's car gas.
If I was kind of wondering.

435
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,980
Yeah,
I think it is a natural gas.

436
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,350
I think that's the whole point that day.
So it's a,

437
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,750
but it's a pipe,
right?

438
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,760
Right.
Pipe that pumps gas to all these people

439
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,290
and it broke and they,
they say that the whole is really big

440
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,460
now cause it's like they,
this fucking eight foot wide hole.

441
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,090
I think there's people that live around
there that can't go home like they had

442
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:15,060
to replace.
I like a whole neighborhoods of people

443
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,740
and they can't,
they still can't go home.

444
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:18,300
To this day.
They can't go home.

445
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,380
It's crazy.
No,

446
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,380
they had evacuated 2.5 million pounds of
methane every day.

447
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,600
Oh,
let's be honest.

448
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,550
Methane's air.
So it doesn't really weigh anything.

449
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,230
So it could be £1 billion.
Well,

450
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,550
but it's an 8 billion pounds of meth.
True.

451
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,000
How did they measure what's maybe it
actually has weight to it.

452
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,740
That's how it gets how you get to a
pound.

453
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,980
It's like measuring a pounds.
That's a lot.

454
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:51,140
Then it has to be a ways and nothing.
It's a lot slower.

455
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,710
Ton of feathers in a ton of bricks.
Like it's still a ton.

456
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,830
Yeah,
but this is 2.5 million pounds of Shit.

457
00:19:58,831 --> 00:19:59,910
So light,
it can float.

458
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,210
So it's like the individual particles
are very light.

459
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,250
They're floating right there.
Gases.

460
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,410
Maybe we're getting scammed and we don't
even know it.

461
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,730
This Jackson guys like we need more
money to get this all this pounds of

462
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:13,590
gas.
Yeah,

463
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,070
that's a very good point.
Bp can go to where the kid to grow.

464
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,970
Maybe that's what it pumps into things
and then now it's like just blowing out

465
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:28,710
into the air.
Maybe that's how they're measuring it.

466
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,750
I think that's what it,
that's what pumps through there.

467
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,150
The whole thing is nuts,
man.

468
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,320
That says they tried to use in mud,
but they tried doing concrete.

469
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,240
God,
you know what?

470
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:42,570
When I hear they tried to do it but it
didn't work.

471
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,570
I fucking freak out.
I really do.

472
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,190
That is like the last thing

473
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,590
I ever want to hear when there's a
national crisis,

474
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,753
you know?
Well,

475
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,620
they tried to do this,
but it didn't work like,

476
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,910
oh Christ.
I th they they,

477
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,320
this is a hard one.
This is not easy.

478
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,530
We're just so lucky.
They're smart people out there.

479
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,340
We'd be so fucked.
We would be so fucked.

480
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,730
We're so lucky.
There's engineers at work on this kind

481
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:12,010
of shit.
Like you don't even think about it.

482
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:17,170
We don't think about the streets.
Think about the fucking highway system

483
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:18,910
and you complain.
You know,

484
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:23,650
you'll let go the fuck and work in Jesus
Christ to got this lane cut off so they

485
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:26,350
could fix the road.
What the FOC.

486
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,590
But think about how in general,
how fucking cool it is that we've

487
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:37,591
hardened the ground and smoothed it out.
All look cross this mother fucker.

488
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,910
You know,
and everybody's like,

489
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,610
man,
the fucking rubes ruin the landscape.

490
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,130
Absolutely.
And a lot of places and this place is

491
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:45,921
one of them,
right?

492
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:48,040
And it looks like shit.
It's just a bunch of roads.

493
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,500
We over did it,
we overdid it.

494
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,410
We've got crazy.
We put too many roads in one spot,

495
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:58,411
too many buildings.
We ignored the rules of having food

496
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:02,920
nearby and vegetables and stuff.
We ignored all that.

497
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,170
We just said no,
it's just fucking piled on top of each

498
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:06,430
other.
Woo.

499
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,870
And,
and that's what we did.

500
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,900
But the idea is fucking amazing.
The idea that when you're in a place

501
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:17,140
like Montana and you're driving through
these mountain ranges,

502
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,730
the,
the roads don't bother you,

503
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:19,990
man.
They don't bother you.

504
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,580
You don't care if there's a road there.
Cause you're looking up at this insane

505
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,890
natural beauty.
And you're just like,

506
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,590
just fuck.
This is crazy.

507
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,700
This is,
this is like the most insane artwork you

508
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:38,230
could ever buy.
Could never look as beautiful as this.

509
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,210
Like really amazing artwork is always
amazing to see someone's expression and

510
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:44,770
when someone does something that's
really dope,

511
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:45,604
it's cool.
It gives every,

512
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,380
all this good feeling like,
wow,

513
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:50,380
that was amazing.
That's a cool piece of art.

514
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:52,390
That's a beautiful sculpture.
God,

515
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:55,630
that's a pretty painting.
But when you see the mountains,

516
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:57,940
man,
there's something about those things

517
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,710
like a snow cap mountain.
You're like,

518
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,180
fuck.

519
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,200
And it's limited if you think about it.
Yeah,

520
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:06,120
like that.
Let's look at that fucking view.

521
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,980
That's not going to exist in a hundred
years.

522
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,230
That view right there,
there's going to be so many drones

523
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:13,260
flying around Amazon prime crap.
There's going to be people with their

524
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:17,670
hover boards up in the air like it
that's not going to exist in a hundred

525
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,420
years.
That view.

526
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,730
Well that we would have to preserve it.

527
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,960
That's what the idea of having,
um,

528
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,070
public wilderness public a forests to
the stuff that it's supposed to be ours.

529
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,370
That's what Teddy Roosevelt wanted to do
way back in the dame.

530
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:39,371
And when they instituted these ideas and
got a public land,

531
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,470
um,
like signed off to to us so that like

532
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,950
there's,
there's giant swaths of this country

533
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,490
that are ours as American taxpayers and
camping.

534
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,830
And what's that?

535
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,320
Does that include the sky in the future?
That's probably not like that shit.

536
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,420
That shit's going to be filled with
advertising and stuff.

537
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,010
There's going to be a drone that just
sits there that just for a year,

538
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,320
probably try to make some laws against
that if it becomes a real problem.

539
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,940
But like yellowstone,
like,

540
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:13,840
look at Yellowstone National Park,
a place is fucking amazing man.

541
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,380
And it's,
it's an incredible place to visit.

542
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,290
It's incredible.
Like you have a real good chance of

543
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,860
seeing like bisons and shit.
You got a good chance to see in a

544
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:27,580
fucking bear too.
You gotta be real careful because um,

545
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,300
they've killed hikers like more than I
think it was more than one attack.

546
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:38,950
And I know at least one dead over the
last like five or six years,

547
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:42,700
because they think that these bears are
getting too accustomed to being around

548
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:44,890
people.
They know that if you break into

549
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:46,990
someone's car,
they usually have food in there.

550
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,230
They know that coolers usually have food
in them.

551
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,700
They get smart.
And so once they come around,

552
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:53,170
people once like,
fuck,

553
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:54,850
then they start coming around all the
time.

554
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,210
There's a,
I've been fucking with my neighbor like

555
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:00,450
eight,
he got a new one.

556
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:01,820
It's not,
want to admit this.

557
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,750
It's all funny.
Uh,

558
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,610
he's from,
I don't know,

559
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,950
but he,
he must got a new router because I have

560
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,210
nowhere.
I got a new Wifi,

561
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,230
like,
uh,

562
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,960
like network to join and it's unlocked.
Right.

563
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,843
So,
uh,

564
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,470
I just used it the other day just to see
like how fast it was just in case if I

565
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:21,410
needed to use it or whatever.
I forgot that I had it.

566
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,820
That's illegal,
isn't it?

567
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,660
Especially
you can't be let go and go.

568
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:29,180
This was my router's other name.
This is all a dream.

569
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,460
But I used to read word up magazine.
Exactly.

570
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,890
But I,
I,

571
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,920
uh,
I forgot that I had done it on my phone

572
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,520
and I been at connecting to it every
time I come home it just connects to his

573
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,250
Wifi.

574
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,390
But you know what I mean?
So the other day I was,

575
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,920
if you have apple tv you can like play
things on your apple tv from your phone.

576
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:51,830
It's called air place.
So I wanted to show a video to somebody

577
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:54,320
and I did it and I'm like,
why is this not working?

578
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,600
And I'm like,
wait a second one Wifi Martin.

579
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:59,630
I'm like,
I'm on the other guy's Wifi apple TV.

580
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,960
So like I've just been going like a
porn,

581
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,110
you know?
And the other day

582
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,500
you better stop right now.
It's so fun to do though.

583
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,350
I was just like,
yeah,

584
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,060
but it's really super illegal.
Yeah,

585
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,010
I guess it is.
What if you had kids in there?

586
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,920
I'm just playing gay porn.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

587
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,720
Get a bike is just so you could see you,
right?

588
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,620
Yeah,
exactly.

589
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,933
Wow.

590
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,900
I love that shit.
That that in printers like it when

591
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:38,040
people have printers on their Wifi and
you just print out dick pics all day on

592
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,320
their printers,
that's rude as well.

593
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,070
That was rude as well.
Let me ask you this,

594
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,550
have you ever wondered if like we can
feel Wifi and have you ever wondered

595
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,630
like if we can feel electricity in the
room,

596
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:59,160
like maybe it's not enough where we
could tell for sure if it was happening

597
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,430
or if it's not happening but enough
where there's like there's just like a

598
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:06,240
subtle underlying thing that your body
is experiencing.

599
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,930
It doesn't really make sense.
Like a radio wave,

600
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,690
like radio waves.
Why Fi's satellites,

601
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,890
satellite radio and TV,
satellite signals,

602
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,580
w gps signals,
what's all this.

603
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,780
We're sure for sure as it's not doing
anything to us cause we haven't really

604
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:28,380
been doing that for that long.
Is that something to be worried about?

605
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,770
You know,
if you take a cat who's most sensitive

606
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,390
animal ever that gave you that cats like
just sitting there and you turn on

607
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:40,140
something right next to it that has wifi
right next to his little whiskers,

608
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:43,650
you would think it would even maybe
twitch just a teeny bit.

609
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,700
You know,
and I'm sure it doesn't,

610
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,620
I'm sure.
Do you think so man,

611
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,540
when you like your remote control,
your cat,

612
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,470
if you like remote controlled your cat
like they were cat would like,

613
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,550
hey,
what the fuck you doing?

614
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,860
You Man.
I think if there's anything the cat

615
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:57,300
would feel it.
I think if any animal,

616
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:01,590
the cat would be the first thing that,
I mean the cats can tripping on ghost.

617
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,060
You know,
it's the cat.

618
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:08,061
Cats have amazing senses except the
sense like they're not intelligent.

619
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,120
They're not intelligent like a person.
They have amazing census,

620
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:14,490
like their senses are off the charts for
sure.

621
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,950
Yeah.
I would think that if anything a cat,

622
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:22,290
but I would think that their senses are
only around to do what they need to do

623
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,870
in the natural world.
I mean that's why the sense is a

624
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,900
sensitive smell.
They can feel things,

625
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:30,390
you know the it can like feel the ground
moving.

626
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,900
Their pads on their paws are like really
soft.

627
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,720
You know when they can,
they can walk like really quietly when

628
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:39,750
they're sneaking up on shit.
Like cats are fascinating little animals

629
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,880
man.
If you watched it and the cucumber

630
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:43,320
videos,
the cats,

631
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,540
it's probably one of my favorite thing
for some reason.

632
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:47,130
If you'd take,
don't do this to your cat.

633
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,180
Supposedly it it's mean,
but if you take a cucumber,

634
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,700
put it behind your cat when it's not
looking.

635
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,160
If the cat turns around and looks at the
cucumber,

636
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,080
it will freak the fuck out.
Like something in its DNA.

637
00:28:59,081 --> 00:29:00,990
It makes it think it's a snake or
something.

638
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,290
But there's videos,
thousands of videos on youtube,

639
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,750
but people trying it almost all the
time.

640
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:09,210
If a cat sees a cucumber just laying up
behind it,

641
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,660
it will jump up and run away or great
things.

642
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:13,650
Have you seen these videos?

643
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,860
Why a cucumber?
I think it's something in their DNA that

644
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,390
that just thinks it's like,
oh,

645
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:22,920
dangerous snake or or,
but for whatever reason somebody just

646
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:25,650
found out by mistake that you put a
cucumber behind a cat,

647
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,530
it'll freak it out.
And then there's all these animal people

648
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:29,760
that are like,
don't do that.

649
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:32,670
You're stressing her cat out.
And I could see because all the cats

650
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,580
reactions are like death.
Like get the fuck out of here

651
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:36,600
immediately.
You know?

652
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,060
It's pretty funny though.
It's some of the funniest videos.

653
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,130
Do you ever see his and cucumber

654
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,851
on Youtube?
Yeah.

655
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:45,730
You don't want to freak cats out man.
This are pissing all over the place.

656
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,240
Yeah,
right,

657
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,070
exactly.
You Freak your cat out.

658
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:50,410
They will fucking piss in your pillow.
I told him.

659
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:52,930
Sure I don't,
I haven't had a cat and almost a year

660
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,140
and I don't miss the litter box.
I don't miss that smell.

661
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:58,420
I don't think I might.
I might never get a cat again.

662
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,940
The litter box things a fucking real
issue.

663
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,960
You have a box of shit in your house.
Yeah.

664
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,920
Fox is shit and cat piss from ungrateful
roommate.

665
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,400
That doesn't pay shit,
then it gets mad at you when he tried to

666
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:10,870
trim their hair.
Yeah.

667
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,450
Yeah.
My cat scan,

668
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,240
they get trimmed and they freak out
about it and it doesn't hurt them and I

669
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:22,360
pet him the whole time when the lady's
grooming him.

670
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,600
But uh,
one of my daughters is allergic to cats

671
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:28,660
and it makes a big difference if you,
we trim the cat's hair.

672
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,620
She doesn't have a bad allergy,
but it's certainly an hour change.

673
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,950
She's been tested for it.
So when I'm doing this,

674
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,040
I have to fucking just hang out with the
cat the entire time.

675
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:39,851
Like,
just chill,

676
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,230
man.
I'm telling you,

677
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:43,660
that ain't nothing.
I was just a little massage with a

678
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
little thing.
Do you trim it or do you have somebody

679
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:46,960
to call?
The lady does it.

680
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:49,000
She's a professional,
but it's a,

681
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:52,090
it's weird to see them fucking freaking
out about it.

682
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,070
I had a cat once.
It loved it.

683
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,713
She loved it.

684
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,890
Spazz spas would just chill like you,
you would do it and she'd,

685
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,430
she just hang out.
It's pass.

686
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,180
It's not around anymore.
I'm sorry.

687
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,380
She was 19.
Damn.

688
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,470
She made it a long time.
That was a cool cat.

689
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,650
She's a very cool cat.
I've been thinking though,

690
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:17,110
cause I mean I've lived with cats in my
whole entire life.

691
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,090
I've been thinking of getting one,
but I don't.

692
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,700
That kind of a thing is a real problem.
They'd get mad at you.

693
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,270
They pee places.
Yeah,

694
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,380
for whatever reason.
And if you have another animal,

695
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,000
it's just a lottery.
If it gets,

696
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,270
it gets along with the other hand.
The more now it's a total lottery.

697
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,510
Especially cats.
Cats usually don't get along with other

698
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:39,511
cats like it took my 19 year old cat,
a solid five years to get used to Oliver

699
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,500
Oliver.
It's like the easiest going guy too.

700
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,110
I love cats,
man.

701
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,240
They're cool.
They're like having these weird little

702
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,430
things that live with you.
You know the these weird little warm

703
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:57,460
love buckets.
It's just come over and just want love.

704
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,240
They just want to cuddle with you.
Like my cat oliver is brutal man.

705
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:04,660
I can't watch TV without this
motherfucker demand and massages.

706
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,450
He just like literally like headbutts
me,

707
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,290
drops his body into my lap,
rolls around.

708
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,330
He like demands massages.
He's hilarious.

709
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,180
You got a cucumber that cat?
Yeah,

710
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,550
he's a funny cat man.
My cat is funny as fuck.

711
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:21,270
He's so smart.
He's just still like,

712
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,280
just likes to chill and hang out.
And the other cat of the fluff at the

713
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:29,260
white one,
that one is um,

714
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,740
she's a little bit more assertive.
Like she,

715
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,560
it's funny like she attacks him like,
you know,

716
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:39,700
cats like we'll play fight.
It's always heard Jack and him it.

717
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,800
So it's always her like around a corner
and like he'll be like hanging out and

718
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:48,650
she'll be like,
he doesn't know that she's back there.

719
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,630
So she knows.
He doesn't know.

720
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,370
So her little legs start shaking and her
tail starts flickering and she's moving

721
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:59,150
real close and then she pounces on him
and fucks him up and then he put the

722
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:03,500
fuck bitch and he backs up and they
chase each other for a couple of feet.

723
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,030
It's hilarious man.
But they're both such pussies cause

724
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:11,420
they're both rag dolls like they're the
nicest cats.

725
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,010
Even when they fight,
they don't even fight.

726
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Even when they fight like fucking,
they barely do anything to each other.

727
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:20,900
They're like fake fighting.
You know?

728
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,460
They like each other.
They're there.

729
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,540
They have fun together.

730
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,340
Yeah.
I mean that's cancer.

731
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,060
Some of the funniest,
funniest animals that

732
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,810
that exist.
She didn't get let him outside the shit

733
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:31,141
though.
Look,

734
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,310
a dog.
Just gross.

735
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,880
He's work.
The training.

736
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,710
Yeah,
they actually work pretty,

737
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:37,790
yeah.

738
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,220
Well actually you would think that that
wouldn't work,

739
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:43,940
but I know like three people that do it
and it worked almost immediately.

740
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,490
The Great.
Robert Schimmel had a bit about it.

741
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,260
I bet he does.
He goes,

742
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:49,220
you don't,
they can drink.

743
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,270
How's it go?
He goes,

744
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,300
you know,
they can train cats to use your toilet.

745
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,231
He goes,
yeah,

746
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:55,640
great.
Now when you don't have to go the

747
00:33:55,641 --> 00:34:00,050
fucking cats in there.
Well fuck it.

748
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,780
I'll use this litter box and it goes.
Then your friend comes over.

749
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:04,630
We show a fucking mountain lion for a
bat.

750
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,950
Robert Schimmel,
God damn,

751
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:13,460
I miss that guy.
One of the first people I ever saw do

752
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,920
comedy.
He was so nice.

753
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,470
God Damn,
that guy was nice.

754
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:21,140
He was like one of the nicest people
I've ever met.

755
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,400
He was so friendly,
like every time I saw him.

756
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,350
So he's just happy,
like warm moment was so sad when that

757
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:32,450
guy got sick.
And then to recover from that and then

758
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:37,290
the car accident as fuck man.
Ooh.

759
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,970
There's a lot

760
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,500
people that,
that uh,

761
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,140
you know,
like when you go to the comedy store and

762
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:46,600
you look at the walls of how many,
you know,

763
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,900
great comics that just fucking
disappeared.

764
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:54,340
And I'll sit there sometimes and just
google everybody's name that's on the

765
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:55,150
wall.
Like what,

766
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,830
you know,
to see where they're at now.

767
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,220
And it's amazing how they just fall off,
like,

768
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,550
just disappear and never do anything.
Like what happened to the,

769
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,790
this person,
this person and this person.

770
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,800
Yeah.
I mean,

771
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,550
people get lost in life and people move
on to other shit too though.

772
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,290
You know,
sometimes people just decide they don't

773
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:17,640
want the stress of performing anymore.
Maybe they like other creative

774
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:18,980
endeavors.
You know,

775
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:23,310
you and I talked about that for a while
when you weren't doing stand up,

776
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,770
you know,
you were making these funny videos and

777
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:26,450
you're like,
well,

778
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:26,880
you know,
I'm,

779
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,370
I'm already kind of a comedian.
You know,

780
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:32,190
it's just my audience is the Internet.
When you were doing videos,

781
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,850
which that was an excuse because I
didn't want to do standup.

782
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,020
I mean,
after I did that Bob hope joke,

783
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,771
I'm like,
I'm good,

784
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:37,980
I'm

785
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,170
done.
I don't want to ever feel that pain ever

786
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,820
again.
Yeah.

787
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:44,910
And some people,
the risk of that pain,

788
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,980
it's just not,
it's not worth it.

789
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,810
It's not worth it to do that to your
life.

790
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:53,460
When you maybe also like painting or
maybe also like writing books or maybe

791
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:56,310
you know,
some people you don't have to do it.

792
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,960
You know,
like that's the thing about standups

793
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:59,340
tell.
Like if you do it and you don't want to

794
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:00,600
do it anymore,
everybody's like,

795
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,350
you don't even want to do it anymore.
Like,

796
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,910
yeah,
you fucking sell out.

797
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,030
Like people will say that about 80
murphy,

798
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,171
you know,
like,

799
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,280
man,
he's not real stand up.

800
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,840
He doesn't do standup anymore.
It'll get here,

801
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:15,300
like the hardcore bros talking like
that.

802
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,790
I can see it's hard because to be a
standup you really still,

803
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:21,980
even though how rich you get,
if you become a movie star,

804
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:25,460
you're a millionaire.
You still have to go and in practice and

805
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:28,250
go to the comedy clubs.
So I can see where it's easy to quit.

806
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:29,780
If you get to a certain point where
you're like,

807
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:30,614
you know what,
I don't,

808
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,210
I'm a grown adult,
am rich.

809
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,550
I have a wife and kids.
I don't want to go through this little

810
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:37,220
shitty club and practice these new
chokes,

811
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:39,950
you know,
so I can see how it's easy to get out of

812
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:41,030
comedy,
you know?

813
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,370
Yeah.
You just don't want the pain of it.

814
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,450
You don't want,
it's like exhausting cause like safe.

815
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,100
You started some pursuit in your life.
Like if you started off and you are a

816
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:58,101
painter when a painting school and all
that Shit and you got through it and you

817
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,240
became a,
you know,

818
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,060
a respected artist and you're painting
all the time,

819
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:07,560
but you fucking hated painting.
Like you were done with it like you had

820
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,200
done with it.
You want to go build sailboats,

821
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:12,300
you wanted to,
you have these other ideas in your head

822
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:15,540
that you want to pursue,
like happens to people,

823
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,650
you know,
so.

824
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,270
So if they quit doing,
stand up,

825
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,400
you know,
that's okay.

826
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,860
Did you ever think you ever see me,
I'm off hills home.

827
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,580
Do you ever think there's like something
that you haven't started yet?

828
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:27,091
Like,
like,

829
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:27,750
you know,
I'm just,

830
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm going to learn how to play guitar
this year.

831
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,490
Like is there anything that you've in
the back of your head that you've kind

832
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:34,410
of fucked around with?
Like the idea of

833
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,750
no,
because I suck so hard at the new things

834
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:39,910
that I'm doing already.
Is that true?

835
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,910
You started becoming an archer and now
you're fucking Robin Hood and you're

836
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:43,744
like,
what are they like?

837
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,770
Well,
it's,

838
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:49,690
I'm not good at all.
I'm constantly practicing at archery,

839
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,390
but as you compare it to me,
to somebody who's really good,

840
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,540
like I'm,
I put a lot of hours in,

841
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,970
I practice a lot.
I,

842
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,800
I'll shoot like sometimes a hundred
hours in a day.

843
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,000
Wow.
Yeah.

844
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:02,860
But um,
it's,

845
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,920
cause I kind of obsessed with it.
And some sort of a weird way,

846
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,510
you know,
it's fascinating to me.

847
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,140
So that's one thing I already obsessed
with that I suck at.

848
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,760
And when I meet you like compare me to
someone like Cameron Hanes or a

849
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:17,590
professional archer that you like might
see on,

850
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,130
like a friend of mine just sent me this
photo of my friend Johnny Rivet sent me

851
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:22,330
this photo of this young girl.

852
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,480
She's like 20 years old and she's won
like I think he said three world

853
00:38:28,301 --> 00:38:31,390
championships in a row and she's an
archer.

854
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,740
They don't like those people were like
really good with bows and arrows.

855
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,750
Like there's a total next level when
it's like they're shooting at like 50

856
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:43,420
yards and they're hitting the bullseye
every time.

857
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,450
And the on the acts itself at 50 yards,
they're just dead calm and just dead on

858
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:52,030
the inside.
And then when they released that string,

859
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:56,080
nothing moves and that Arrow goes
sailing right into that acts.

860
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:59,380
And they can do it repeatedly.
They can do it like 10 times in a row

861
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:00,490
sometimes.
I mean,

862
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:03,370
these people were freaks.
It's really interesting to watch.

863
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,950
We used to do archery,
an elementary school that was a part of

864
00:39:06,951 --> 00:39:10,550
our physical education and I'm sure you
can't do that anymore.

865
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,720
Like I,
I probably,

866
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,650
yeah,
I bet not.

867
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,550
Is it illegal to walk around Robin Hood
style with the arch you like,

868
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,690
you know,
like a bow and Arrow?

869
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,240
Like is like,
can I walk into like an old guard and

870
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,680
not get kicked out if I have a

871
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,090
no,
they wouldn't let you in.

872
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,980
It's a weapon.
Yeah,

873
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:27,010
it's a weapon.
It's a slingshot to like,

874
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:31,100
I had some friends who brought their
bows to Vegas and they,

875
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:31,880
uh,
the,

876
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,070
the hotel wouldn't let them take him up
to their room.

877
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,240
Wow.
Really?

878
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,320
Yeah.
They had to check them.

879
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,170
Yeah.
They had to check in with the hotel.

880
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,180
It didn't seem right.
No,

881
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:44,420
it's seemed well,
yeah though it does like what some

882
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:48,710
fucking asshole is going to be on your
elevator with a bow and Arrow,

883
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,960
but you have a shooting people in the
area,

884
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,710
but you can't like trust these people.
You don't know him.

885
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,090
These people,
they come in,

886
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,160
they're not even Americans.
They got a bow and arrow.

887
00:39:58,161 --> 00:39:59,870
They're crazy.
I mean,

888
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,471
what?
No,

889
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:01,940
you can't have this in your room.
Give us,

890
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,020
give me that thing.
You know,

891
00:40:03,021 --> 00:40:05,660
like you come to the saloon,
put your fucking gun in the bucket,

892
00:40:05,661 --> 00:40:08,070
sir.
You know hotel,

893
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,400
but give me your fucking bow and arrow.
No,

894
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:13,700
you can't practice it in your room and
accidentally shoot the fucking

895
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:15,890
television.
I don't know you.

896
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,310
What if you get whiskey it up and you're
working on your fucking draw length in

897
00:40:19,311 --> 00:40:23,030
your hotel room and you send your Arrow
flying through the middle of the

898
00:40:23,031 --> 00:40:26,000
electrical box.
It caused a fucking 13 story fire that

899
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:26,990
killed a thousand people.

900
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,580
Yeah,
but what have you used the steak night

901
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:30,830
from your state?
Can you just start stabbing everybody?

902
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:31,581
You know,
it's like,

903
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:35,840
I think of that a steak knife would be
way more dangerous than a bow.

904
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,760
You got to stop putting ideas in
people's heads.

905
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:41,210
It's like airplanes.
It's like I always freak out word like,

906
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,430
oh,
you can't have a razor blade on the

907
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:45,440
airplane,
but yet you could have a Mac book pro

908
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:48,470
that you can smack over the head of
somebody and probably kill him.

909
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,340
It's hard to grip though.

910
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,970
Sure.
Like real impact,

911
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,030
but a skateboard,
he's if fuck somebody up on a

912
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:56,190
skateboard,
you know,

913
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,400
you can,
I don't think they were going to change

914
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:00,420
it,
but I don't think they did.

915
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,830
They were going to make it so that it's
legal to bring pool cues on.

916
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,430
But uh,
I think they made it so that it's not

917
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:12,390
anymore
cause like they thought that you beat

918
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:13,780
people up with a pool cue but you,
uh,

919
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:16,710
skateboards,
probably a better weapon than a pool cue

920
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,933
maybe.
Hmm.

921
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,120
More distance.
Certainly more distance she knew.

922
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:22,770
And the person you're trying to hit with
a skateboard,

923
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,340
which makes it more effective in a lot
of places because you could hit somebody

924
00:41:26,341 --> 00:41:27,220
in,
they can't hit you yet.

925
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,440
Poke,
he's going to break pretty quick,

926
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:30,970
right though.
One good hit and maybe that's

927
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:33,380
skateboards,
got trucks that hands on what it's out

928
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:34,010
of.

929
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,610
But,
uh,

930
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,510
most pool cues have multiple pieces and
that's,

931
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:42,200
that's part of the problem.
It's not one gigantic piece of wood

932
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,240
because for most,
for the most part,

933
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,520
like if you'd see like a,
a beautiful pool cue,

934
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,690
what a lot of players,
like they liked the queue to be 19

935
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,070
ounces.
So,

936
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,180
um,
they,

937
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,750
they work on making this a few people
that like 20,

938
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:00,740
20 is rare.
Like sometimes you'll find the outliers

939
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:03,890
that like something heavy,
but they're pretty specifically between

940
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:06,470
18 and 20 ounces.
Now for a normal person that would seem

941
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:07,970
like,
well what's the difference?

942
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,320
Well to the pool players,
like it's uh,

943
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:15,410
the professionals and it's a touch that
they develop where they know the exact

944
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:18,710
weight of their queue and so the exact
impact in half,

945
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:21,230
so they have to balance it out.
And a lot of times the way they bounce

946
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:24,740
it out is by using different kinds of
woods leaves one kind of wood for what

947
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:26,750
you see,
but another kind of wood for under the

948
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:27,440
wrap.

949
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,090
And it'll be a lighter,
like a maple,

950
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,490
like similar to like maybe shaft would
even like.

951
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,190
And then on the outsides of the,
um,

952
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,870
the front and the back,
it might even just be cord where they

953
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,960
drill through the actual hardwood and
they stuff a core in there of a softer

954
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:47,960
would.
So the cue achieves the desired look and

955
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:50,900
may be uniform field,
but it has a lower mass,

956
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,860
lower weight so he can get it down to
like maybe even below 19 ounces or you

957
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:56,870
know,
for reasonably,

958
00:42:56,871 --> 00:42:58,310
uh,
well done.

959
00:42:58,311 --> 00:42:59,780
Cute.
But if you hit somebody the head with

960
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:02,750
that,
it's going to break for the most part.

961
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,980
Yeah.
But if you get one of those fucking

962
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:10,400
house cues,
like those full splice house cues and

963
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:12,110
you grab the,
the hard end,

964
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,840
the dark end,
you could beat the fuck out of somebody

965
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:15,674
with one of those.

966
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,210
That's a different animal because that's
an one solid piece of wood,

967
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,810
especially those old school ones.
Those are like the Dufferin blanks,

968
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:24,750
you know,
it's like a,

969
00:43:24,751 --> 00:43:27,530
uh,
like a rosewood on the bottom and a

970
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:30,260
maple on the top and right from the
splice where it's white,

971
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,080
that stuff's going to break.
But the stuff above it,

972
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,760
you could beat the fuck out of somebody
with the stuff above it.

973
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,080
That hard shit.
You could,

974
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,870
you could hit them as hard as you want.
You probably wouldn't break it.

975
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,620
Probably be pretty hard.
Yeah.

976
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,980
People were like all four could do it
bro.

977
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,660
Okay.
Maybe you can,

978
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,130
but maybe like a normal person would be.
It would be very hard to break that on

979
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:54,200
somebody.
You can do it.

980
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,710
You could be some fucking,
you know,

981
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,070
incredible hulk type character and just
smash it on the first attempt.

982
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:06,071
But I would imagine like it's a much
harder and denser,

983
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:09,680
uh,
like weapon than a,

984
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,860
like a standard,
like very pretty pool cue or someone

985
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:17,861
like a lot of Pokios or like artistic.
It's really interesting because people

986
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:19,790
outside the pool world,
they would,

987
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:22,160
they would think like,
what are you talking about?

988
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:25,910
There's a,
there's like a collectors like group of

989
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:28,850
pool cue addicts and they're addicted to
pool cues.

990
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:30,620
They collect cues.
But Dude,

991
00:44:30,621 --> 00:44:32,070
you'd be,
there's guys out there

992
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,860
that have collections.
They're worth 1 million bucks and more

993
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,930
and pool cues.
Yeah.

994
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:40,080
There's people that have coin
collections of butterfly things like

995
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:42,800
people that collect butterflies.
That's the creepiest shit head.

996
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,250
You got a dead bug pins all over it.
I've gotten a new one.

997
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,900
I'm cautious.
Knew who won.

998
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,390
There was um,
uh,

999
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,350
Terence Mckenna and an old lecture was
talking about,

1000
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,580
um,
catching bugs and that there's something

1001
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,310
like,
because we used to eat bugs a lot when

1002
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:06,060
we were like primates,
that there's almost like this genetic

1003
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,880
excitement thing that comes when you
catch a bug.

1004
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:11,610
So it's similar to what happens when you
catch a fish.

1005
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,710
You know,
that thing that happens when you catch a

1006
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,880
fish,
if you fish for it,

1007
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,540
um,
if you're a fish and then ate it,

1008
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:19,950
uh,
once,

1009
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,050
yes,
just once.

1010
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,640
Yeah.
You haven't been fishing since dad,

1011
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,620
like 14,
15.

1012
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,820
He would always take me fishing.

1013
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,680
That's wow.
Yeah,

1014
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,600
that's fish since then.
Fishing's fun,

1015
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,560
man.
It's awesome.

1016
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,110
It's a great way to catch a meal to
right.

1017
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,310
And um,
but there's some weird fucking primal

1018
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:40,180
thing that happens when you pull it out
of the water.

1019
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,500
Oh he feel like smeagol like or
something,

1020
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:45,440
you know,
it's like he gets like,

1021
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,830
it's flopping around,
attack me.

1022
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,380
You know,
there's something weird about it.

1023
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:00,390
There's something weird about a fish.
You catching something and some alien

1024
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:03,870
world yanking it out of their lives in
the water.

1025
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,080
There's a living thing in the water and
you can see him down there fucking cast

1026
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:14,331
to them and you throw a piece of meat
that's covered by a hook and he bites

1027
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,780
the meat and you will fucking,
you guys,

1028
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,840
dad hooked through the top of his mouth,
a giant steel barb digs into his face

1029
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:30,590
and then he's still fighting like hard,
like polling left and right and left and

1030
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:36,030
the rod is pulling the real is fucking
the,

1031
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,301
the,
the,

1032
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:37,500
the,
what is that thing called?

1033
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,150
The clicky thing on the wheel.
The drag,

1034
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:44,330
the drag and the real is it's peeling
cause it's fucking fish pulling outline

1035
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,420
and you finally get him in there and you
suck them out of his dementia and he's

1036
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:53,190
flopping around your boat.
That is a crazy experience to crazy.

1037
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,730
You just pulled some alien creature.
It's like lives in the water.

1038
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,580
500 years from now,
let's say 500 years.

1039
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:04,200
They're definitely going to figure out
how to take animals and make them be

1040
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:06,900
able to communicate to us.
They're going to make that crossover.

1041
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,430
500 years.
Fuck yeah,

1042
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,170
maybe not even 500 years.
Right?

1043
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,560
But when that happens,
we're not going to go fishing anymore

1044
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:17,700
cause you're going to be like talking to
fucking fish are all going to die.

1045
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,800
We're all going to be vegans.
We're going to be forced to be vegans

1046
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:24,801
because of technology.
Well if we do know for sure what an

1047
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:28,860
animal's feeling when it dies,
it would definitely be way hard.

1048
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:29,694
Eat me

1049
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,920
way harder.
That's um,

1050
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,600
that's the argument of like the,
the Vegan movement.

1051
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:40,570
That makes the most sense because if
we'd really knew,

1052
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,200
but here's the thing,
a lot of these motherfuckers didn't even

1053
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:46,870
care about each other.
Like those deer that I eat,

1054
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:49,420
they kill each other all the time.
They fucking stab each other with the

1055
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:51,400
horns and to their heads.
Bears,

1056
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,780
bears early.
Cannibals,

1057
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,240
they're all cannibals.
People get angry.

1058
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:56,920
Like if you eat black bear,
like first of all,

1059
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:59,110
black bears,
delicious and bears are fucking

1060
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:01,150
monsters.
They're cannibals.

1061
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:02,750
It's,
that doesn't mean we don't want to kill

1062
00:48:02,751 --> 00:48:04,370
them or don't want,
um,

1063
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,730
uh,
let them live or wanting to extinguish

1064
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:07,780
all of them.
No,

1065
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:08,770
no.
They're cool.

1066
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,040
It's cool having these animals,
but they don't give a fuck about you get

1067
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,280
it.
Kinda recognize that they do not give a

1068
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:21,520
fuck about you until they start talking
to us and then we find out they're just

1069
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:25,050
very hard to get to know.
But they were really loving it.

1070
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,730
He just got to take it.
Imagine if you found out what they were

1071
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:32,650
thinking.
Could you imagine if you could read

1072
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:36,220
minds and you just looked out into a
pack of wolves?

1073
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,650
There was chasing elk up to the top of a
mountain.

1074
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,700
Do you know how terrified you would be
if you could read the mind of a wolf?

1075
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,020
He'd be like,
Oh my God,

1076
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,600
we've got to kill them all.
Oh my God,

1077
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:49,120
we got to kill them all to the,
all these you want to do is kill.

1078
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,030
I told the one and two Kale if we could
read them,

1079
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,160
but we don't read their minds.
So we look at him like,

1080
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:54,971
oh,
listen to him.

1081
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:59,650
How
there's just jack that they got to kill

1082
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:02,050
again today.
You know,

1083
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,880
they have a problem with these elk that
they find where a wolves get into these

1084
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:11,881
a elk elk populations and they decimate
the hertz.

1085
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,380
They,
they don't even eat everything they

1086
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:15,700
kill.
It's crazy.

1087
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:20,590
They'll kill like many elk and just
leave half the body behind her more.

1088
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,290
They don't just sit and eat it until
they're done.

1089
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,120
They kill again.
They kill again.

1090
00:49:25,121 --> 00:49:26,490
Just like dogs.
Do you know?

1091
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,640
You ever,
you ever heard of it?

1092
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:29,230
Like my dog got it.
My chickens.

1093
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:32,200
Once my dog is killed,
two of my chickens.

1094
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,150
It's a,
it's a fucking real drag,

1095
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,980
but it's instinct.
You know?

1096
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,640
It's not a bad dog.
It's just nobody told he can't talk.

1097
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,550
He doesn't know in his mind,
chickens or death.

1098
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:43,930
You've got to kill that fucking thing.
There it is.

1099
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:46,450
Go get it.
It's like it's programmed in him,

1100
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,160
so he's a dog.
It's like you literally cannot take it

1101
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:52,510
out of them.
I mean,

1102
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:56,050
you could grow them up with from the
time they're puppies with chickens,

1103
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,100
just like I did with my cats or the dogs
don't think of the cats is the enemy,

1104
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,790
but if they don't grow up with them,
they don't just accept chickens into the

1105
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:06,040
fucking yard and the dog is seven years
old.

1106
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,590
He's like,
what the fuck it is?

1107
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:09,850
Oh,
the chickens live with us.

1108
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:10,860
They're our friends.
Oh yeah,

1109
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:11,800
your friends.
Yeah.

1110
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:13,270
Your friends.
Your friends.

1111
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,640
Okay.
Yeah,

1112
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,510
I'll just leave me alone.
When your friends want to talk to them,

1113
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,410
just Jack Them.
He was just Jack and check.

1114
00:50:19,411 --> 00:50:22,510
It's not his fault,
it's his dog instincts.

1115
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,820
Me Never knew that.
You're not supposed to eat chickens

1116
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,560
before.
He's a grown dog.

1117
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,730
Wolves are very similar in that way.
They want to kill things and they're

1118
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:34,910
beautiful and they're amazing.
I'm not saying we shouldn't have wolves,

1119
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,950
but people have this idea that we
shouldn't keep an eye on those fucking

1120
00:50:39,951 --> 00:50:42,470
things.
I'm Tom,

1121
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:44,550
I'm tired of talking to people about
this.

1122
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,440
Like yeah,
wolves are awesome.

1123
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,880
It's like there was a,
um,

1124
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:51,720
in Canada they're using helicopters to
shoot wolves.

1125
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,190
Yeah.
Cause the Caribou population is getting

1126
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:59,150
decimated because they just go on a jack
and spree,

1127
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,020
Eh,
Eh,

1128
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:00,800
Eh,
Eh,

1129
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,870
Eh,
the wolves just take over.

1130
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,030
They just run rampant when they're get
to a sufficient population where they

1131
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,310
can just dominate herds and surround
them.

1132
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:12,890
And they're like raising them like
cattle.

1133
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,970
They're monsters.
Matt and the Jack Gigantic numbers of a,

1134
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:19,880
if they want to,
they're not conservationists.

1135
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:24,090
Have you heard about the people taking
dogs in the New York City at night to

1136
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,460
take an hunt out?
Rats.

1137
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,860
Well look,
good luck with that little dogs too.

1138
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:28,820
Like little,
like fun,

1139
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:30,050
loving,
like leaving like shit too.

1140
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:31,660
And they just fucking,
just,

1141
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,320
just,
you made me picture it cause I remember

1142
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:34,760
hearing a,
like Mike Rowe,

1143
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,260
the guy from dirty jobs talking on,
uh,

1144
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,200
the OPN,
Jimmy show one day about it.

1145
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:40,760
Like if he went out,
I didn't think he went out with these

1146
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:44,120
people for a few nights in a row and
made a little documentary online trying

1147
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:45,200
to find it right now.
But uh,

1148
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,600
they said it was crazy.
Like the guard for their backs and just

1149
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:50,300
break their backs and toss them around
and just throw them and go after another

1150
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:51,530
one.
Oh my God.

1151
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:54,410
Hundreds will come out of a rap pile or
like in a dumpster and shit.

1152
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,440
Like that dog just jacking him.
Oh my God,

1153
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,630
that's so crazy though.
But they just do that.

1154
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:01,680
That's their instinct.

1155
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,140
Yeah.

1156
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,700
As an adult,
I've never haven't looked at it.

1157
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:05,421
Chicken,
the chickens,

1158
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:08,440
but,
but like is it like an asshole and

1159
00:52:08,441 --> 00:52:10,940
vagina like every other animal and it's
a no,

1160
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:12,070
it,
it is a,

1161
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,820
I forget the word egg whole succulent.
What does the word,

1162
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:19,160
there's a word of the opening.
I forget,

1163
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,220
forget what the word for the,
for the opening rather.

1164
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:23,840
I forget what it is,
but uh,

1165
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,640
it's a,
it's a whole that everything comes out

1166
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:26,510
of Piss,
shit,

1167
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,130
babies,
everything.

1168
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,310
That seems like an upgrade.
But what's the name of that?

1169
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:32,940
Do you know what the name of that hole
is?

1170
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,490
I just find out what a chicken's hole.
I just remember that.

1171
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,360
Oh,
that old porn video

1172
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,800
we're looking at is the chicken wearing
sweatpants and it's fucking adorable.

1173
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:48,200
So funny.
It's really funny.

1174
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,410
It's adorable.
I just remember that old video of that

1175
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:54,410
dude fucking that chicken and I just
wondered,

1176
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,510
you know,
if that's legit,

1177
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,410
like if,
you know,

1178
00:52:57,411 --> 00:53:00,670
if people definitely fuck chickens
fender,

1179
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,390
it just seems sort of like,
well,

1180
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:03,890
if you think about it,
this may know better.

1181
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:08,600
It's like a event or event.
Colloquia that's the fun,

1182
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,880
that's the,
that's the word I was trying to,

1183
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:12,290
uh,
the technical word,

1184
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,090
but vent sounds like I can remember
that.

1185
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,360
But yeah,
everything comes out of one hall.

1186
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,790
It's interesting.
It's like it can't be,

1187
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:22,640
it has to be pretty dirty in there.
Is this the,

1188
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,040
Oh my God,
these dogs are just letting it loose on

1189
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:25,883
rats.

1190
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,180
Oh God.
Oh,

1191
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:29,460
this is so crazy.
Oh my gosh.

1192
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,010
Oh my God.
This is so crazy.

1193
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,960
This doesn't show a ton of it.
Portion of it.

1194
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,940
There's more of it online.
If you want to look it up.

1195
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:39,930
Powerful.
Mike Rowe.

1196
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,920
That's pretty funny.
Mike Rowe has some cool ass subjects.

1197
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,250
His show is fascinating.
That's the dirty jobs guy,

1198
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:48,084
right?
Yeah,

1199
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,140
he does.
Uh,

1200
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,760
he did another one too,
right?

1201
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,610
Did dirty jobs and another one.
This is fucked up.

1202
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,820
These dogs jacket rats.
Oh,

1203
00:53:56,821 --> 00:54:00,090
it's just so fucked up.
Wow.

1204
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:03,240
That's fucked up.
That's what he says on here.

1205
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:06,630
It's unlike anything he's ever seen.
Which after doing all the dirty jobs,

1206
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,220
that's,
that's pretty fucked up.

1207
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,290
I've talked to about this I believe
before,

1208
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:11,340
once,
um,

1209
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,010
at least,
but there was one time where I was in

1210
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:18,510
New York and uh,
yet I had to use a pay phone.

1211
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,150
I didn't have a cell phone at the time
and it was,

1212
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:22,980
uh,
early nineties.

1213
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:27,510
I guess real early nineties and I parked
my car at this gas station.

1214
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,970
I was pumping the gas,
I set the pump on it,

1215
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:35,150
and then I went over to the payphone and
in the time it took me to walk from that

1216
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:38,940
car to the pay phone,
put the coins in and turnaround.

1217
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:43,830
There was three rats on my car.
They were running over the top of my

1218
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:46,290
wheel wells.
They were running over the top where the

1219
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:49,710
wheel is and then down under,
and then another one would come up and

1220
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:51,300
jump up and go down under.
And I was like,

1221
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:54,870
what the fuck?
Like they were everywhere,

1222
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:56,760
man.
There was so many of them.

1223
00:54:56,770 --> 00:55:00,570
It's so creepy because I was watching it
going through.

1224
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,880
You can't,
you can't stop these things.

1225
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,020
Who's got many of them?

1226
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,370
There are.
I know.

1227
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:07,290
It was just thinking like,
what is it like to sleep in these

1228
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:09,810
buildings and hear those things running
through your walls.

1229
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,760
Oh yeah,
this is fun.

1230
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,900
What did these,
but,

1231
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,610
but,
but these rats can have like rabies and

1232
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:18,570
one of them made it,
one of them made it into the sewer.

1233
00:55:18,571 --> 00:55:19,440
Huh?
Wow.

1234
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,250
Fuck.
Yeah.

1235
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,300
Oh God.
Killer rap.

1236
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:22,470
Awful.
Uh,

1237
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,780
that was junk.
They give the dog a rabies shot.

1238
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:27,210
Simple.
I do.

1239
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:29,520
I do.
I did this podcast with tiffany the

1240
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:32,970
other day in my back in a wreck,
like ran right over foot.

1241
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,330
I think it might've ran in my house
though.

1242
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,480
And so now I'd be like freaked out
thing.

1243
00:55:37,481 --> 00:55:39,330
There's a rat in my house,
my,

1244
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,540
my cat fluff fat.
We were uh,

1245
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:46,530
eating and a cat walks over to the
fucking table with a dried out rat,

1246
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,720
like an old dead rat.

1247
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,190
Oh crap.
Like dude,

1248
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:55,220
like I have,
I have some work done on my basement and

1249
00:55:56,491 --> 00:56:01,491
I'm just thinking maybe there was like
something trapped in the wall that life

1250
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,080
as a,
they were cutting to the wall.

1251
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:06,310
She got the old dead rata.
I don't,

1252
00:56:06,311 --> 00:56:09,720
I have no idea where the fuck came from,
but it was in my house and it was like a

1253
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:10,740
mummy man.
Oh,

1254
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:14,370
maybe it was under like a couch or
something or maybe it doesn't make

1255
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,990
sense.
We've tried to figure it out.

1256
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,530
We try to figure this fucking say
dismissed.

1257
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,090
I hate this,
but cats will find shit,

1258
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:21,560
you know,
I,

1259
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,980
you know,
cats will find shit.

1260
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,780
They bring it to you like a,
yeah.

1261
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,740
So weird.
It's so weird.

1262
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,180
They do that.
So weird,

1263
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,440
delicate little fucking massage.
Demanders that's what they are.

1264
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:39,940
Little tiny massage demanders I like,
I make the mistake sometimes it's trying

1265
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:42,100
to write on the couch,
like with the laptops,

1266
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:46,150
try write shit and um,
this motherfucker just relentless.

1267
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,940
He'll come up and just bang,
headbutting my hand,

1268
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,480
step on the keys.
He doesn't give a fuck and you push him

1269
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:53,051
off.
He's like,

1270
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:53,800
yeah,
yeah,

1271
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,770
I know you pushed me off and now I'm
back and I want the exact same thing I

1272
00:56:56,771 --> 00:56:58,900
wanted a couple of seconds ago.
But uh,

1273
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:00,370
it was going to try and do a little
slower.

1274
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:02,260
Maybe.
Like he doesn't give a fuck.

1275
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:04,720
He just wants massages,
period.

1276
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,560
Give it to me.
I would have to spray him with water to

1277
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:11,190
get them off me.
That's the only one.

1278
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,840
Even that just the sound,
but I don't want it to,

1279
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:15,880
I don't want to do that.
I just want them to chill out.

1280
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,370
Just once you just relax,
just hang out with me,

1281
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:20,590
man.
I don't have to demand attention.

1282
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:22,210
You fucker.
You know?

1283
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:27,180
Did you see that there's a,
I guess a new either movie or series Oj

1284
00:57:27,181 --> 00:57:28,440
Simpson versus the people?

1285
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:29,760
Yeah.
You know,

1286
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,650
I was talking about this with
someone and uh,

1287
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,410
it was a good point,
um,

1288
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,830
that the people that are growing up
today,

1289
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,920
like the 20 year olds,
they don't even know that story.

1290
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,400
I think for us it was a part of our life
growing up.

1291
00:57:47,401 --> 00:57:48,510
Could we were like,
Holy Shit,

1292
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:51,060
he got off.
He got off.

1293
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,970
Oh my God.
Everybody was pretty much convinced he

1294
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:57,810
was guilty except those people that
needed to be convinced

1295
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,650
the lead up to it.
Some of the most popular movies,

1296
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:03,200
the naked gun series,
we all kind of fell in love with this

1297
00:58:03,201 --> 00:58:04,280
like guy,
you know,

1298
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:05,114
it was kind of like

1299
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:10,210
what not that guy and have nowhere that
took two years of everyone's life

1300
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,680
following this guy's story.
And still,

1301
00:58:12,681 --> 00:58:16,100
it's still fascinating to this day when
you see him on tv,

1302
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:18,590
when there's like some sort of a prison
thing going on.

1303
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,200
And then you see they have photos of
them and they're moving them around or

1304
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:22,160
something like that.
So like,

1305
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,160
Whoa,
whew.

1306
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,120
There's a strange to see man.

1307
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,200
I wonder if there's any way to do any
new evidence using today's DNA

1308
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,960
technology to find out if he,
you know,

1309
00:58:32,961 --> 00:58:34,210
like this,
this making the murder,

1310
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,540
you know,
you haven't watched it yet.

1311
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,000
Just making this murder things
interesting cause of like,

1312
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:40,340
you know,
like the technology that they're using

1313
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:43,280
and stuff like jumping a Ramsey.
Like they,

1314
00:58:43,281 --> 00:58:46,730
it seems like they should be able to
find who killed her now you using

1315
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,310
today's technology.
Yeah.

1316
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,490
I don't know how much evidence they
still have that they have saved.

1317
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:53,390
I don't know how that works.
Yeah.

1318
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:56,920
Do you know how that works?
I'm sure they have evidence.

1319
00:58:56,921 --> 00:58:58,780
I mean,
I would imagine.

1320
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,770
Yeah,
right.

1321
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,540
They can go back in there and find,
you know,

1322
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,670
use this.
I don't know,

1323
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:06,370
man.
I think the real problem with that John

1324
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,320
Benet things that they had fucked up the
evidence.

1325
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,710
One of the parts of the,
the murder case that was fucked up as it

1326
00:59:11,711 --> 00:59:16,060
was like fresh snow and uh,
these people would have been able to

1327
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:21,620
find footprints and the fresh snow and
these cops tread all over everything and

1328
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:22,664
that

1329
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,450
that was a big mistake.
And that the way they investigated it,

1330
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,900
apparently there were a bunch of
criticisms about the way they handle it.

1331
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:33,500
They just had never handled a case like
that before as the boulder police

1332
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:37,090
department,
Boulder's a small town and the Johan,

1333
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,660
we got a lot of fucking crazy people
murdering their kids or in I'll

1334
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:43,400
allegedly,
they don't even know who did it.

1335
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,290
Right.
They never figured out who did it.

1336
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,120
Yeah.
I still think it's the family.

1337
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,470
Well,
everybody thinks it's the family,

1338
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:51,230
but that's a fucking crazy indictment if
you're wrong.

1339
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,570
You bought that crazy conspiracy theory
the other day that they think there's,

1340
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,830
the online world thinks there's some,
uh,

1341
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:01,480
crazy con,
a serial killer that's tied to this.

1342
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,610
Oh my God.
They've linked him to that Jon Benet

1343
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:06,910
Ramsey thing to the same serial killer.
Like he's done these crazy stories that

1344
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:10,570
have no explanation for who did what and
someone else's got blamed for it.

1345
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,400
It's a,
it's a crazy story too,

1346
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,280
but who knows if there's anything,
anything in there.

1347
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,620
Wow.
Well,

1348
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,760
I dunno man,
but it's the point being like if they

1349
01:00:20,761 --> 01:00:24,330
wanted to try to figure out who the
murderer was today,

1350
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:28,260
you would have a real problem.
I think with the evidence being

1351
01:00:28,261 --> 01:00:29,190
contaminated.
I mean,

1352
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,870
how much evidence they have.
What about there?

1353
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:35,790
How long does the body last before you
can zoom it and examine it?

1354
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,670
You know,
what can you get from that?

1355
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,580
Who the fuck knows?
I don't have those answers.

1356
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:42,780
Remember those Hbo Shows?
Uh,

1357
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,240
the,
the real autopsy series.

1358
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,320
You can't watch it,
dude,

1359
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,940
that guy,
that guy used to freak me out that

1360
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,260
Michael Baden,
you know that guy.

1361
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:53,170
The autopsy.
Got It.

1362
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,600
Yeah.
I couldn't watch those shows,

1363
01:00:54,601 --> 01:00:56,280
but who,
I'm not into that like,

1364
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:59,250
like I do,
I don't know if we talked about this,

1365
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:03,240
but there's like this bridge in Pasadena
called suicide bridge and it was made in

1366
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:06,270
like,
I believe the 30s and like people die

1367
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,440
all the time off the spreads.
They just go there and kill themselves.

1368
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,480
I know somebody that was hiking and he
was just hiking and there's this a girl

1369
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,110
dead on the,
on the,

1370
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,780
on the trail because there's like a
trail that goes on the bottom of it.

1371
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,430
Oh my God.
And then somebody told me,

1372
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:22,680
I know if this is true,
but somebody told me that like when they

1373
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:26,550
have huge rain storms,
that all these bones just kind of washed

1374
01:01:26,551 --> 01:01:28,800
down from this big or that sounds like
some skin.

1375
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,613
Oh.

1376
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:35,310
But yeah,
this is the balls down the mountain.

1377
01:01:35,311 --> 01:01:39,390
And then like in the trail that you just
like see like little bone here and there

1378
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:40,224
that,
uh,

1379
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:45,210
from bodies that like jumped and were
never found in this side of this.

1380
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,760
Wow.
There's that many people have done it.

1381
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:48,960
I mean,
it's totally,

1382
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,600
it's not like they're going to do a
thorough job of cleaning you if he

1383
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:54,030
jumped off a bridge and splatter all
over the rocks.

1384
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,890
Yeah.
I think how much can they clean up?

1385
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,590
I think it's over a hundred people
though.

1386
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,910
She jumped off the last girl,
that girl that,

1387
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,120
that my friend took it.
He like,

1388
01:02:01,121 --> 01:02:03,340
he sent me a photo of her body just
laying there,

1389
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,170
but he,
he's,

1390
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,330
I guess that girl,
uh,

1391
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:09,330
lived in woodland hills and she was like
38 and she just,

1392
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,550
that's it.
I'm just going to go to this suicide

1393
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:13,170
bridge and do it.
Oh my God.

1394
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,180
That's awful.
Yeah.

1395
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,610
Fuck man.
Falling.

1396
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,640
Just not seem like poop proper way.

1397
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,100
It's fucking real though.
I bet the rush,

1398
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,980
when you realize you've pulled that
trigger and done that.

1399
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:30,210
I saw that video you posted the Andy
Stumpf just teasing you guys to go jump

1400
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:31,950
with them.
They'll look like he landed on the

1401
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:34,290
ground at the end of it,
but I think it was triggering his

1402
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:36,600
parachute parachute.
Oh,

1403
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:38,140
he's terrifying.
Oh,

1404
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:39,780
I don't know.
I don't know what it's called,

1405
01:02:39,781 --> 01:02:43,080
but there's this thing in Mexico where
it's a restaurant that's up in the air

1406
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:46,560
where you're sitting glass bottom in the
middle of the air,

1407
01:02:46,561 --> 01:02:48,630
just eating a hot air balloon.
No,

1408
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:49,890
it's uh,
it's like,

1409
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,630
uh,
I don't know if you can find it,

1410
01:02:51,631 --> 01:02:52,650
but like,
like a,

1411
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:57,210
it's like you sit down on these chairs
and the whole thing is just kind of like

1412
01:02:57,211 --> 01:02:58,260
way up in the air.
I don't know.

1413
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,770
There it is.
And you eat like super high up.

1414
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,680
Oh my fuck.
Oh,

1415
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:06,960
dinner in the sky.
It's 150 feet in the air.

1416
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:09,450
Why would you ever want to do that dude?
Seriously.

1417
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:11,790
Fuck that.
But if you have to go to the bathroom,

1418
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,050
what if you do?
What if you're eating with Mike

1419
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,010
Goldberg?
Yeah,

1420
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:17,844
but you have to like,
sorry,

1421
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:21,580
we're going to have to lower this.
Like you eat with this.

1422
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,660
Oh fuck.
Fuck Outta here.

1423
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,780
Oh my God.
It's on Crane Ladies and gentlemen.

1424
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,310
It's in Mexico so you don't even know
you're strapped in and they're giving

1425
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:36,810
you food while this whole thing fucking
sways back and forth and the breeze,

1426
01:03:36,811 --> 01:03:39,150
they're taking selfies.
All my God,

1427
01:03:39,151 --> 01:03:42,360
you people are freaking me out.
I'm nowhere near that thing and I'm

1428
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:45,360
freaking out.
My toes are clenched up.

1429
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,930
My fingers are crunched up.
I heights,

1430
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:49,830
man,
I can't do it.

1431
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,260
Oh my God.
The Shit you used to do on fear factor,

1432
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,180
man,
I don't even understand how those people

1433
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:54,750
couldn't do it.

1434
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,570
I am so glad that nobody ever got hurt
doing that.

1435
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,390
You could do a show up there if you
want.

1436
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:01,720
Oh,
marriage in the sky.

1437
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:04,590
This guy.
Wow.

1438
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,540
Let's just promote other people doing
it.

1439
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:10,200
Coco in the sky.
I'll promote a joey diaz performance

1440
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:16,380
cock suckers walking from the clouds.
Dude,

1441
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:19,260
last time I did his podcast,
him in lead,

1442
01:04:19,261 --> 01:04:24,261
just dropped acid and,
and then he gave us these stars and I

1443
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:27,240
knew I wasn't going to eat one,
but I ate one.

1444
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,530
George,
I was with George Perez.

1445
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,360
George couldn't feel his whole entire
face,

1446
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:33,180
the whole thing.
And then near the end maybe he's like,

1447
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:36,160
that song,
I can't feel my face when

1448
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:43,250
I look over at Lido and his eyes are
rolled back in his head and like that

1449
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:45,000
guy,
man,

1450
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,620
he like Joey.
Really?

1451
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,700
He's an animal.
He's not here to play games.

1452
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:52,270
Who?
Trops acid?

1453
01:04:52,271 --> 01:04:55,600
The like nine at night on a Sunday
soldier.

1454
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,030
Like a fucking soldier.
He's an original.

1455
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,580
You got to let him be him.
He knows what he's doing.

1456
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:03,990
Oh yeah,
I know he does.

1457
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,020
Where Lito spent the night at the studio
though and I'm just like,

1458
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:08,610
man,
if you eat ass,

1459
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,890
that's like a 10 to 11 hour trip
usually.

1460
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,260
So Joey after the podcast is probably
like,

1461
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:13,980
all right,
great.

1462
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,250
Take care.
And this port,

1463
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:17,950
Lisa's neither tripping on acid and it's

1464
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:22,170
this random office building somewhere.
Oh,

1465
01:05:22,171 --> 01:05:25,570
how long is acid typically last?
It used to last,

1466
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,060
I would say about 11 hours too.
You're like,

1467
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:29,620
all right,
I think I could go to bed now.

1468
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,060
Oh my gosh.
Yeah,

1469
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:32,010
it's not cool.
It's like,

1470
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,390
uh,
it's like Mush,

1471
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:36,640
like mushrooms times five.
It used to be,

1472
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,970
I don't know if it's the same.
My friend just did a payoti ceremony.

1473
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,100
Oh,
hollow and native American.

1474
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:44,380
Would you ever do that?
Would you ever do the,

1475
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:49,300
here's the problem with ceremonies,
you doing them with a bunch of people

1476
01:05:49,301 --> 01:05:51,540
who don't even know,
and there were some times she gets

1477
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,950
around,
we're just going to freak out.

1478
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,390
You know,
when you want to do your payoti manage,

1479
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,370
probably be alone or be with someone you
trust.

1480
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,870
I think,
you know,

1481
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,530
if you get lucky and catch a good group,
you might have to Tom your life at a

1482
01:06:05,531 --> 01:06:06,520
payload,
a ceremony,

1483
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,260
or you could,
uh,

1484
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,470
you could just be hanging out with
people who are completely out of their

1485
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:13,660
fucking mind and also do drugs.

1486
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,210
That's possible too.
Like you don't have any control.

1487
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:19,150
You're just guessing whether or not this
is going to make sense.

1488
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,633
No,
thank you.

1489
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,160
I think pay is,
that's the one where you puke all the

1490
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:26,020
time and then the last days or
something,

1491
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:26,360
right.
You,

1492
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,640
it is a tricky one,
man.

1493
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,770
It's some sort of a,
um,

1494
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,800
like it's from a Cactus,
right?

1495
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,670
And there's another drug that's just
like pod that's also from a cactus that

1496
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,533
uh,
that,

1497
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,960
that I think you can also get similar
effects from it.

1498
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:44,680
I can't remember the name of the Cactus,
but I guess in Mexico it's,

1499
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,100
you can find them all over the place.
There's a movie about,

1500
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:50,380
about it too.
I forget the name of the movie,

1501
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,780
but there's a movie about this guy
that's just trying to get this cactus

1502
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:55,390
and trip on.
I forget what is the active ingredient

1503
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:56,224
pot,
right?

1504
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:00,400
Isn't there a masculine mask?
When I was in high school,

1505
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:02,000
it was mask.
I think I was,

1506
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:06,160
the kid dropped two hits a mask and
they'd say Mush Mush.

1507
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:07,750
The kid dropped two hits,
a mask.

1508
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:12,060
He was fucked.
Like I remember like dropping Maskelyne

1509
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,650
like people would talk about dropping
mask and I'd be like,

1510
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:18,470
you gotta be out of your fucking mind.
There's no way you people,

1511
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:23,290
animals.
There's a future looks like in the early

1512
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,460
eighties,
seventies that it seems like people used

1513
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:28,660
to always talk about that.
Like that don't exist in like masculine.

1514
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:29,590
Yeah.
This is good land.

1515
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:33,520
And there was something that [inaudible]
has showed me a bottle of recently that

1516
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:34,690
it was like,
what the fuck?

1517
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:36,760
I didn't even know that existed.
Quite lids.

1518
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:39,160
Yeah.
That's the bill cosby drugged is that,

1519
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:44,110
yeah,
we'll allegedly that's what he allegedly

1520
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:49,111
was in trouble for was a procuring or
giving these girls this stuff allegedly,

1521
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,620
you know,
they're saying now that,

1522
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:57,910
uh,
there was a been some problems with the

1523
01:07:57,911 --> 01:07:59,950
trial.
It's like the first day,

1524
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:02,710
there was some article that was written
today that are red.

1525
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:07,711
They were saying that the one of the key
witnesses doesn't think that it's legal

1526
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,550
to,
uh,

1527
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,810
to prosecute based on the deal that
cosby got back down.

1528
01:08:13,811 --> 01:08:15,980
I think that's Oh yeah,
he made

1529
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,090
a deal.
Yeah,

1530
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,410
I heard,
yeah.

1531
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:23,410
That it was that bill cosby was about to
buy NBC and I earned the Illuminati.

1532
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:25,360
Yeah,
man.

1533
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:29,050
Illuminati.
Don't try to take him down,

1534
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:31,840
man.
I've heard that too.

1535
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:32,950
Yeah.
Where did I read that?

1536
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:34,930
So,
uh,

1537
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:39,850
so this guy was essentially saying that
he's not on bill cosby side,

1538
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:43,780
but the actual law,
the way the law is written,

1539
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,510
he gave them some sort of a deal in,
um,

1540
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,690
though the reason why he was willing to,
uh,

1541
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,580
give out the statement that he made,
you know,

1542
01:08:54,581 --> 01:08:57,010
what's that called?
Declaration or whatever the fuck it is

1543
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:57,870
when they,
when you're,

1544
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,260
um,
anyway,

1545
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:00,580
in court,
he,

1546
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:04,570
he deposition.
So he was willing to do the deposition

1547
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,650
based on the fact that he couldn't get
prosecuted,

1548
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,220
prosecuted for it.
So now that they want to prosecute him

1549
01:09:12,221 --> 01:09:16,720
for the same case,
this guy thinks that that is not legal.

1550
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:19,500
Hmm.
How old evidence about,

1551
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:21,980
I don't know.
I don't know.

1552
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,390
I don't know.
We're talking about the same case just

1553
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,310
because there's so many cases.
Yeah.

1554
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:30,070
It's another smoke and fire.
That's a,

1555
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:34,660
that's a terrifying one though,
that this guy was doing that to people.

1556
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,540
We all know that.
People like that though.

1557
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:42,110
Just unfortunately dps guys.
Yeah,

1558
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,170
but that's such a deep level,
man.

1559
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:49,050
That's such a scary level.
Scary level of a tattooed cause.

1560
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,230
The scariest.
I mean,

1561
01:09:50,231 --> 01:09:51,970
you're watching,
you're looking at people lying

1562
01:09:51,971 --> 01:09:54,160
unconscious,
you know,

1563
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:57,760
and then you're fucking them.
Is it lying on conscious or just not

1564
01:09:57,761 --> 01:10:01,570
remembering is lacking out?
Who knows?

1565
01:10:01,571 --> 01:10:02,950
Man,
I don't know.

1566
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,220
I think a lot of them are saying it's
blacking out.

1567
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,303
You know,
man,

1568
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:10,750
the trauma of that.
You imagine if you just thought that guy

1569
01:10:10,751 --> 01:10:13,600
was really cool and you want her to hang
out with them and you woke up with one,

1570
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,990
one shoe on and your,
your panties are down by your ankles and

1571
01:10:16,991 --> 01:10:18,850
you realize what happened,
what,

1572
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,430
and you don't even know what to say.
You know what I mean?

1573
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,440
You don't even know what to say.
You're like,

1574
01:10:23,441 --> 01:10:25,210
what happened?
What?

1575
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:30,310
And especially if you're drinking
together and you're having fun having a

1576
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:33,010
couple of cocktails,
you don't think anything's going wrong.

1577
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,730
I this diet,
now I have one drink,

1578
01:10:37,731 --> 01:10:39,620
I'm wasted.
And uh,

1579
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,720
the other day,
luckily I didn't drive.

1580
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,730
The other day I had like two or three
drinks and Black Super Bravo blackout.

1581
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:49,160
Like,
like I had no idea how I got home.

1582
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:51,260
I did.
It had no idea I would like anything

1583
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:54,710
that happened.
But that Shit's scary because I existed

1584
01:10:54,711 --> 01:10:57,410
as a human for at least three to four
hours.

1585
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,320
I even like I checked my phone,
I was texting people,

1586
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:03,690
well they ciro honestly when you drink a
lot that's,

1587
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:08,460
it starts happening like later in your
life that like people that um,

1588
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,660
are
there getting drunk like five,

1589
01:11:12,661 --> 01:11:15,810
six a week and I'm not saying you
necessarily wear,

1590
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:21,050
but they're,
their tolerance starts to like drop off

1591
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:25,230
their body's ability to fight it off,
starts to like drop off and the

1592
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:28,410
propensity towards blackouts,
it's when,

1593
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:30,750
the way it's been explained to me by
someone who had a problem with it,

1594
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:35,610
that it gets to this point where it's
just like super common to blackout or it

1595
01:11:35,611 --> 01:11:39,690
didn't use to be.
So it just wears on you over time.

1596
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,700
It's definitely where I've been like,
oh I don't remember.

1597
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,890
I talked to you last night and I like
that stuff but it's just like you

1598
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:48,580
remember pieces,
this is,

1599
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,530
this is the first time I that I can
remember that it was so such a straight

1600
01:11:52,531 --> 01:11:54,630
blackout.
Like I was freaked out.

1601
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:57,810
Like I just sat there and it was just
trying to remember anything that

1602
01:11:57,811 --> 01:12:00,810
happened and like the last for four
hours or whatever,

1603
01:12:00,811 --> 01:12:02,790
cut to was my bathroom covered with
blood.

1604
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:06,920
Oh yeah,
man.

1605
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:09,910
Blackouts a terrifying because people,
they black out and they get behind a

1606
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:10,870
wheel.
Yeah.

1607
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:16,350
It is so insane that we have a culture
that sells alcohol everywhere.

1608
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:22,810
You can buy guns everywhere.
You can do all this crazy shit,

1609
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:27,730
but you still can't openly by,
we'd

1610
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,031
like the,
if the,

1611
01:12:30,031 --> 01:12:31,660
as,
if that's going to be the tipping point

1612
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,630
is if we just,
this whole country just says,

1613
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,720
all right,
let's all just relax and,

1614
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,320
all right,
we're going to let it through.

1615
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,470
Like as if that,
that would somehow another

1616
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:46,780
make this whole thing fall apart.
I'm sorry,

1617
01:12:46,781 --> 01:12:47,300
go ahead.
No,

1618
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:47,940
no,
that's it.

1619
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:48,631
I,
I just,

1620
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:50,280
you know,
the whole marijuana thing recently,

1621
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:51,610
I,
uh,

1622
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:54,300
I keep on forgetting that,
that it's illegal.

1623
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:57,690
Like about the other day,
I was just like,

1624
01:12:57,691 --> 01:12:59,460
I was just like,
wow,

1625
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,860
this is actually illegal.
What I'm doing right now.

1626
01:13:01,861 --> 01:13:04,920
You just kind of forget that marijuana
is still illegal.

1627
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:05,581
Well,
Brian,

1628
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,540
you have a prescription,
right?

1629
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:12,060
Right.
But the number one thing that cops are

1630
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:17,061
being trained for and,
and the work cases is marijuana duis

1631
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:18,420
now.
Like,

1632
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:19,283
really?
Yeah,

1633
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,630
like my friend's a lawyer and he goes,
dude,

1634
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:25,440
it's surpassing drunk driving now as far
as like the money,

1635
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:26,910
uh,
just how many,

1636
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,250
how many,
uh,

1637
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:33,350
people they catch for marijuana duis and
it's the same Dui driving under the

1638
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:36,090
influence is the same as alcohol.
How do they prove it?

1639
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:39,840
They have tests now that they can
immediately just test you and they're

1640
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:41,190
not the most accurate.

1641
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,310
So that's the only,
that's the only thing that the,

1642
01:13:43,311 --> 01:13:45,720
that you have going for you.
But if they,

1643
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:49,380
if they pull you over and there's smoke
coming out of your window or they see a

1644
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:50,340
joint on you,
you know,

1645
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:52,170
that just got burned.
They can,

1646
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,630
they can,
they can test you now and go,

1647
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:56,700
Oh yeah,
you have marijuana in your system.

1648
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,640
You got a Dui.
No matter if you have a license,

1649
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:02,580
no matter if you have anything.
And it's totally like one of those

1650
01:14:02,581 --> 01:14:03,301
things.
And he's telling me,

1651
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:05,040
I'm like,
she's just Christ.

1652
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:08,370
You know,
like you don't think about that is still

1653
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:11,950
illegal and if it wasn't

1654
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,480
illegal,
okay,

1655
01:14:13,481 --> 01:14:14,910
let's just say it's legal,
right?

1656
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:20,250
I think we can all
point to like at least one or two people

1657
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:23,890
that we know that probably shouldn't
drive high.

1658
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,750
Yeah,
yeah,

1659
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:27,790
absolutely.
So they're impaired,

1660
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,840
right?
But it's a fucking way different kind of

1661
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:35,290
impairment than the kind of impairment
that you would get from alcohol.

1662
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,940
Like it's not like a muscular
coordination type of impairment.

1663
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:43,120
It's a different impairment.
It's like a judgment impairment perhaps

1664
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:48,080
or just freak out the anxiety like that,
that kind of impairment and the

1665
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,890
inability to recognize when to merge
when not the merge.

1666
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,940
Oh,
I'm fucking freaking out,

1667
01:14:51,941 --> 01:14:53,950
man.
That could happen for sure.

1668
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:58,150
That can definitely happen and that
should be taken into consideration

1669
01:14:58,151 --> 01:14:59,800
whenever you make it legal to do
anything.

1670
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:04,480
We agree that it's all legal to drink
caffeine and getting your car.

1671
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,340
We all agree that it's speed.

1672
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:09,550
You could have a monster energy drink
sitting in your cup holder when a cop

1673
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:11,290
pulls you over.
That's math,

1674
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,780
man.
It's an awesome math.

1675
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:16,510
It's delicious,
but it's obviously not math,

1676
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,940
but it's,
it's like probably like how much

1677
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:21,340
caffeine is in one of those monster
energy drinks

1678
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,340
a lot.
Dude.

1679
01:15:24,341 --> 01:15:26,800
Those things,
if you don't want to play games,

1680
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:31,090
if you want to just kick crazy,
just chug one of those big ones.

1681
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:35,320
Like the ones that looked like a,
the lemonade cancels giant lemonade cans

1682
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,450
like chuck,
one of those fucking things.

1683
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:40,450
Monster energy drink those big giant
tall boys.

1684
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:43,840
Those things are ridiculous.
Not that much.

1685
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,670
Really says it says 160 milligrams per
16 ounce cane.

1686
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:49,260
Wow.
What about starbucks?

1687
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,580
That's interesting.
Yeah.

1688
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,120
So what else is in there that uh,
well there's probably a lot of sugar for

1689
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:54,954
sure.
Fuck.

1690
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:59,040
What about sugar free?
The will have sugar free ones.

1691
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:01,200
That's interesting.
I would've thought it was way more.

1692
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,610
I was going to add to what you're just
saying though,

1693
01:16:02,611 --> 01:16:05,280
but there's a certain amount of people
you know that shouldn't be driving

1694
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,860
anyway,
even when they're stone sober.

1695
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:09,660
They just,
they can't handle all the inputs.

1696
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:14,230
We have a winner,
Jamie van and with a,

1697
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,073
when I,

1698
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:16,260
yeah,
I know a girl that,

1699
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:19,280
that I'm sure,
I don't think she knows she's driving

1700
01:16:19,281 --> 01:16:20,930
when she's driving.
You know what I mean?

1701
01:16:20,931 --> 01:16:22,310
Like,
like I'm constantly like,

1702
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:23,144
you know,
the lights,

1703
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,860
red lights,
right.

1704
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:26,750
Like if I wasn't here,
you would have just ran that.

1705
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,970
Uh,
like I was watching this lady texted him

1706
01:16:28,971 --> 01:16:31,670
drive yesterday completely in the wrong
lane.

1707
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,100
I was like,
look at this bitch completely in the

1708
01:16:34,101 --> 01:16:37,120
oncoming lane just over crossing over,
right

1709
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:40,110
to double yellow lines,
phone in her hand,

1710
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,450
texting,
looking up swerves back in.

1711
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:44,250
I was like,
oh my God,

1712
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,850
she's crossed right over into this
oncoming street.

1713
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:54,180
Have you had an every ever had a,
any kind of panic attack or panic,

1714
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,310
panicky feeling from we'd recently?

1715
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:01,500
No.
If I have any panic attacks I've had

1716
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,980
from,
we'd have been,

1717
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,560
uh,
the big ones have all been from edibles.

1718
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:08,740
Yeah.
And the panic attacks have been more

1719
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:09,583
like

1720
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:15,550
just a super hard introspective,
objective view of life and death and the

1721
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:24,731
cycle of things and the son running out
of fuel eventually.

1722
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:28,010
This is planet no longer being viable
for life,

1723
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,430
that all those things are gonna happen
millions and millions of years in the

1724
01:17:31,431 --> 01:17:33,470
future for you.
Not so much time.

1725
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:34,970
Everybody,
not so much time.

1726
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:37,640
If you're born today,
well congratulations.

1727
01:17:37,641 --> 01:17:40,090
You only have a hundred years or if
you're,

1728
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,090
you're really,
really,

1729
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:42,320
really,
really lucky.

1730
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:47,950
So for all of us,
this whole thing is a quick flash where

1731
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:51,800
we try to figure out what's going on.
It's a quick flash,

1732
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:55,280
it's happening right in front of our
faces and we're living it and while

1733
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:56,150
we're living it,
we're going,

1734
01:17:56,151 --> 01:17:58,040
what is going on here?
Like what?

1735
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:02,090
What are we exactly doing?
What are we exactly doing or working and

1736
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:04,670
sleeping and eating and fucking and
going to the movies.

1737
01:18:04,671 --> 01:18:05,570
But what are we doing?

1738
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,880
What is this?
What is this race?

1739
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:11,600
What does this race of people doing?
What does this weird thing that only has

1740
01:18:11,601 --> 01:18:15,020
a hundred years of life?
It just starts to figure out the how

1741
01:18:15,021 --> 01:18:20,021
bizarre and weird this whole thing is
before it's snuffed out and the new

1742
01:18:20,661 --> 01:18:24,860
ones,
what they're similarly short lifespan

1743
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:28,340
benefit from all the information passed
on by the ones before them,

1744
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,190
but still go through life like it's a
dream.

1745
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:34,110
Still do everything you do and thank
you.

1746
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:35,550
Is this real?
What,

1747
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,690
what is this life like?
What does the sky,

1748
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:43,130
what is this infinity above my head that
no one talks about every day?

1749
01:18:43,131 --> 01:18:45,170
Infinity is above your head.
What do you do?

1750
01:18:45,171 --> 01:18:47,830
You pull the visor down,
put your fucking shades og.

1751
01:18:47,831 --> 01:18:48,664
God,
it's fucking,

1752
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:49,740
it's so bright.
Uh,

1753
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:53,750
let's see.
You're looking at the reflection of the

1754
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:58,751
sun off gases in the atmosphere above
your head that you need to sustain life

1755
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,350
and we're just so used to it.
We're doing it.

1756
01:19:03,351 --> 01:19:08,351
Think of it as interesting.
It takes a hundred years to stop you.

1757
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:12,770
You could do your best,
but you hit a hundred years.

1758
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:15,590
It's over.
It's not enough time.

1759
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,580
She just just start,
start to recognize the hustle as you get

1760
01:19:19,581 --> 01:19:20,414
older,

1761
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,400
I think.
I think,

1762
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:25,220
you know,
if you had kids today,

1763
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:29,300
I think there a little bit luckier
because I feel like we're on the cuff of

1764
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:31,370
being able to download us,
you know,

1765
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:35,900
very seren and I don't think it might,
we might miss it just probably like a

1766
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,600
couple of years.
I think we will become incredibly

1767
01:19:38,601 --> 01:19:41,870
annoying spammers of ourselves.
That's what we're going to do.

1768
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,370
We're going to be able to download
ourselves.

1769
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:46,640
Then we're just going to fucking shoot
ourselves in the bit torrent and mega

1770
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:48,800
upload.
We're going to put ourselves everywhere.

1771
01:19:48,801 --> 01:19:50,600
Like I want to go everywhere.
I want to go to fucking Europe,

1772
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:53,690
I want to be in Turkey and there'd be
doubles and triples of people all

1773
01:19:53,691 --> 01:19:57,700
throughout the the this,
this artificial world that we've created

1774
01:19:57,701 --> 01:20:00,350
of hyperspace.
We're going to have like a hyperspace

1775
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:05,360
cloud drive of humanity that's going to
be just as fucking crowded as earth and

1776
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:06,620
we're going to go,
shit,

1777
01:20:06,621 --> 01:20:11,400
we don't have hard drive space in the
fucking cloud and these assholes keep

1778
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:13,920
copying themselves cause they want to be
a mortal.

1779
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:18,360
So like rich guys would have like a
cloud serve reflect 200 trillion

1780
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:22,110
terabytes and it would just be filled
with copies of themselves and then they

1781
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:24,840
would just send out fucking like fake
emails,

1782
01:20:24,841 --> 01:20:26,400
Click here to see some Dick.
Whoa,

1783
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:28,030
I want to see some Dick.
And you click there,

1784
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,010
boom.
He,

1785
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:30,850
it's an exploit.
It gets into your server.

1786
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:33,810
Bang.
Makes copies of himself everywhere.

1787
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:35,980
Yeah.
You'll be able to like get Joe Rogan in

1788
01:20:35,981 --> 01:20:38,840
your cars.
Your car has your brain in all your,

1789
01:20:38,841 --> 01:20:42,910
your past and all your memories,
but your cars talking to you and it's

1790
01:20:42,911 --> 01:20:44,350
due.
It's like you're my bro

1791
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:51,060
to imagine if they figure out a way to
not just download your consciousness but

1792
01:20:53,911 --> 01:20:55,800
take parts out you don't need.
Yeah.

1793
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,620
Like take parts out that you don't need,
like your ego.

1794
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,700
Take the ego out and have,
have this consciousness be completely

1795
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:04,710
compliant.
We figured out a way to isolate the ego.

1796
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:08,130
We're going to remove it and we're going
to put this brain in cars.

1797
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:12,000
So he get in your car and you're talking
to you,

1798
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:13,430
but you don't have your own ego.
We go,

1799
01:21:13,431 --> 01:21:14,910
hey man,
I fucking,

1800
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:18,900
I want to have a say or where we drive.
You can't have that shit coming out of

1801
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:20,610
your car.
Like your car has to be completely

1802
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:21,750
compliant.
Right.

1803
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,140
That's how I drive.
I don't,

1804
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:26,160
I don't take advice from my fucking car.
I'm driving bitch,

1805
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:28,410
relax.
But if you could download your

1806
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:30,690
consciousness,
your own conscious in your car,

1807
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:33,270
your car would be literally an extension
of you.

1808
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,160
And the car thinks it's you.
Yeah,

1809
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,450
it's card.
Totally thinks it's you.

1810
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:38,440
I can't see,
well the car,

1811
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:43,020
the car knows that you in it or one.
And then when you're together you're the

1812
01:21:43,021 --> 01:21:44,190
same.
But his,

1813
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:47,190
his legs place in life is to be your car

1814
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:49,700
fuck up.
And you can start downloading you and

1815
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:51,650
everything so you could download you in
the toilet.

1816
01:21:51,651 --> 01:21:53,710
Microwave.
You just have little Joe Rogan.

1817
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,680
Like who thinks it's a real person?
Yeah,

1818
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:59,130
you get invaded.
Like someone would break your door and

1819
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:00,950
opting Dong,
you open the door.

1820
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:04,280
A million bill burroughs compiling and
your house this,

1821
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:09,290
someone decided to just copy bill burn
and put all the bill burr files out into

1822
01:22:09,501 --> 01:22:12,620
the Internet.
You have to kill them all because you

1823
01:22:12,621 --> 01:22:14,510
don't want to a bunch of bill burrs
talking all day.

1824
01:22:14,511 --> 01:22:15,620
So you have to be like,
I'm sorry,

1825
01:22:15,621 --> 01:22:16,730
Bill Byrd,
toaster.

1826
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:17,571
Well,
I'm going to kill you.

1827
01:22:17,571 --> 01:22:19,790
And it would be like wolves.
They're really cool,

1828
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:22,040
but you have to control the numbers.
You know

1829
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,660
that many of,
many of us and might if there's 100

1830
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:31,430
million Jamie vernors,
you would go listen dude enough,

1831
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:36,390
it's too many of you fuckers.
If people don't think about that Shit,

1832
01:22:36,391 --> 01:22:38,190
man,
if it's possible to download

1833
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:40,110
consciousness,
it's possible to copy it.

1834
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,940
It's possible to copy it.
It's possible.

1835
01:22:41,941 --> 01:22:43,980
Spam it.
We're fucked.

1836
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,330
Chill,
broken dildos.

1837
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:47,130
Don't put that dare.
No.

1838
01:22:47,131 --> 01:22:49,110
Get me out of here.
What do you remember when we were

1839
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:54,111
talking a long time ago about being able
to recreate like a celebrity and some

1840
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:57,210
sort of an artificial life that will
have sex with you,

1841
01:22:57,730 --> 01:23:00,450
that you could do that?
Like you could make your own,

1842
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:02,520
you know,
fill in the blank.

1843
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,620
Um,
you could make your own.

1844
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:05,710
Hillary swank

1845
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:11,070
maybe got a hilary swank fetish.
You could literally have a robot sex

1846
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:15,640
doll that is her right like it is her.
I'll give you become Mike,

1847
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:19,040
some super billionaire Donald Trump type
character and you've got long paper and

1848
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:21,730
I'm saying what I'm saying.
I'm saying that guy could,

1849
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,400
he has the cash or one of those things
when they,

1850
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:27,010
when they first start get designed,
he could do that.

1851
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,010
He could do whatever he wants.
He can make like this.

1852
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:32,080
We're going to get there within the
next,

1853
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:35,530
I'd say a hundred years where they're
going to have these artificial people

1854
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:37,910
that you can have sex with that or
you're not going to be able to,

1855
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,610
they're going to be like blade runner
things.

1856
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:42,480
You're starting to describe an episode
of Black Mirror that you haven't seen

1857
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:45,390
yet.
Listen,

1858
01:23:45,391 --> 01:23:46,800
folks,
swear to God.

1859
01:23:46,801 --> 01:23:48,990
I haven't seen that show.
I'm not stealing.

1860
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:51,180
It's so weird.
Yeah,

1861
01:23:51,181 --> 01:23:53,100
I have to see it.
I only saw the pig fucker one.

1862
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,470
It was good.
I liked talking about the really cool,

1863
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:59,880
interesting idea and the way they like
show you how it works is cool.

1864
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,040
Wow.
I need to say they're starting it up

1865
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:04,080
again too.
I think it's coming up while Netflix,

1866
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:07,530
there's only at their six and then
there's like a special Christmas when

1867
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:09,270
they made a little after and now they're
going to start some more.

1868
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:10,560
What's the name of the one I need to
see?

1869
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,270
Uh,
the name of it.

1870
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:14,310
I'm not sure.
Like I said,

1871
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:15,720
there's only six of them,
so,

1872
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:17,700
okay.
It's not that hard to find it.

1873
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,000
Uh,
dammit.

1874
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,300
I had the picture of it here.
Business here,

1875
01:24:21,301 --> 01:24:26,250
the name.
I think it's totally possible that we're

1876
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:31,320
gonna be able to replicate what we are.
It might not happen in our lifetime or

1877
01:24:32,461 --> 01:24:35,040
even our children's lifetime,
but it just seems to me that they just

1878
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:40,041
keep getting better and better at fic,
fixing things and using like Willie

1879
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:42,480
Nelson just had a stem cell operation to
fix his lungs.

1880
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:44,940
Willie fucking Nelson,
you know.

1881
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:46,643
Do you think

1882
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:50,470
like Obama recently said something about
how he's putting out,

1883
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:53,620
you know,
putting an end to cancer and into

1884
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,260
cancer?
Uh,

1885
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:56,780
like he's like,
like we're,

1886
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,600
we are going to solve this shit.
Like he was kind of weird cause it's

1887
01:25:00,601 --> 01:25:01,170
like,
oh yeah,

1888
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:03,780
no one's talked about cancer recently.
Why is that not cured?

1889
01:25:03,781 --> 01:25:06,180
Because they don't want it to let us
know that the Zika virus cause it's

1890
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:07,140
coming.
Yeah.

1891
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,660
Sounds like an old school,
high school football coach and it's

1892
01:25:09,661 --> 01:25:14,490
ready to fuck up the world.
Does Zika virus the second though?

1893
01:25:14,491 --> 01:25:17,820
You can cure cancer by taking a shot or
whatever.

1894
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,520
Eating a pill.
Do you think cigarettes smoking?

1895
01:25:20,521 --> 01:25:24,990
We'll come back and I think everybody
that's been bitching about it and it's

1896
01:25:24,991 --> 01:25:26,600
all everyone's just gonna start smoking.

1897
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,110
Yeah.
If they figured out a way,

1898
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,750
well listen,
it's super possible.

1899
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:34,470
They're going to be able to figure out a
way to make tissue healthier than it is

1900
01:25:34,471 --> 01:25:35,460
now.
Right?

1901
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,870
This for how long?
How,

1902
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,790
what,
what at what price do you pay?

1903
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:42,300
You're always gonna pay a price if you
use something abrasive on your lungs,

1904
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:44,400
like cigarette smoke,
like even joints.

1905
01:25:44,401 --> 01:25:48,510
I've got to imagine that if you're like
one of those hardened leather lung hash

1906
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,900
hash heads,
that's just dude,

1907
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:56,080
just constantly dabbing it.
I just gotta think that there's gotta be

1908
01:25:56,401 --> 01:26:01,401
at least some irritation of your lungs
from the hot smoke.

1909
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,130
Just some vaporizers.
None.

1910
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:09,340
Vaporizer doesn't do any of that,
but I would think that just smoke in

1911
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:12,140
general is not the best idea for you to
take in.

1912
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:16,100
But so cigarette smoke is real bad
because there's all these chemicals so

1913
01:26:16,101 --> 01:26:20,000
they might be able to figure out
something that can regenerate healthy

1914
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:23,360
tissue and get rid of the bad tissue you
that maybe they could give you some sort

1915
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:24,920
of a flush,
you know,

1916
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:28,010
whether it would fill your lungs up with
something and it would just eradicate

1917
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:28,970
all the bad tissue.

1918
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:31,760
Who the fuck knows?
They'll figure it out though,

1919
01:26:31,761 --> 01:26:33,290
Dude.
Whatever it is,

1920
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:36,290
they'll fix everything we're going,
it's going to be so many people.

1921
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:39,590
It's going to be such a problem because
they're going to be able to fix

1922
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:42,890
everything within like another.
How many?

1923
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:43,180
Um,
oh,

1924
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,013
let me make a guess

1925
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,230
again.
Totally unqualified guesses.

1926
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:49,750
That's why airplanes do I have ashtrays
cause they're like waiting for it to

1927
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:50,584
come back.

1928
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,440
Airplane's still have ash trays just for
nostalgia sake.

1929
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:58,480
You think they don't have the new ones
don't.

1930
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,850
Some new ones do.
And the haven put him in the bath.

1931
01:27:00,851 --> 01:27:02,980
They put them in that bathroom and
you're going to smoke.

1932
01:27:02,981 --> 01:27:05,320
They want you to be able to put it out.
What?

1933
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,670
They don't want you.
There was no country.

1934
01:27:06,671 --> 01:27:08,320
You can still do.
It's not like it's just an American

1935
01:27:08,321 --> 01:27:08,760
thing.
Right.

1936
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,730
It's,
I don't know.

1937
01:27:09,731 --> 01:27:11,380
That's a good question.
Is that true?

1938
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:12,820
I bet.
I bet.

1939
01:27:12,821 --> 01:27:15,020
And Vietnam or some shit.
Yeah.

1940
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:17,910
Get out and play with it.
Yeah.

1941
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:18,960
With one of those,
uh,

1942
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:21,670
fat stogies off flights in Philly or
something.

1943
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,080
Do you remember,
do you remember cigarettes on planes?

1944
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,273
Uh,

1945
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:28,660
yeah.

1946
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,200
No,
I went,

1947
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,960
I went,
I didn't fly until I was a freshman in

1948
01:27:33,961 --> 01:27:37,950
high school and my first time was flying
to Chicago and it was when aol first

1949
01:27:37,951 --> 01:27:41,370
came out and I,
it was the first girl I've ever met on

1950
01:27:41,371 --> 01:27:44,250
the computer and I met her in Chicago
and I took all these photos of her and I

1951
01:27:44,251 --> 01:27:47,400
found the camera the other day.
I'd never got developed all these photos

1952
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,260
that are on it.
I should do that.

1953
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:50,723
But,
um,

1954
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,110
that was the first time I ever fly,
fly,

1955
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:55,470
fly them.
And that was already passed a cigarette

1956
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:56,940
thing.
He used to be really strange.

1957
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,040
They used to be this section.
Sometimes the,

1958
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:01,920
this is the only place you get a seat on
the plane was in that section,

1959
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:03,990
so you'd have to be in the smoking
section.

1960
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:06,240
It was like a joke,
like a hack joke,

1961
01:28:06,241 --> 01:28:08,190
like a reuse premise over and over
again.

1962
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:11,280
The smoking section on a plane like a
dice.

1963
01:28:11,281 --> 01:28:14,070
Clay had the best take on it.
You in a fucking tube.

1964
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,140
She's like,
you're in a tube.

1965
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:17,640
The fucking smokes go whenever.

1966
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,870
Oh,
it's true.

1967
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:25,490
It's the preposterous idea that you
could smoke in one area and it wouldn't

1968
01:28:25,491 --> 01:28:28,460
affect the rest of the plane.
I just googled it.

1969
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:32,210
Apparently there's still a rule in the
federal code of regulations that they

1970
01:28:32,211 --> 01:28:36,020
have to have an ashtray,
and I think it's a poll only because in

1971
01:28:36,021 --> 01:28:41,021
1973 a flight crashed and killed 123
people and they're attributed reason was

1972
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:43,850
because of cigarette was improperly
disposed of.

1973
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,710
Right.
Someone still asks.

1974
01:28:45,711 --> 01:28:47,150
The light went up because they break the
rule.

1975
01:28:47,151 --> 01:28:48,740
They still have to have somewhere to put
it out.

1976
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:49,610
Right.
Wow.

1977
01:28:49,611 --> 01:28:53,480
What a crazy concession to the most
bizarre fucking habit we,

1978
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,240
we accept.
It's so,

1979
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:58,940
so common.
It's one of the most common

1980
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:03,060
bad health habits.
It's such a strange one,

1981
01:29:03,061 --> 01:29:05,490
man.
It's so persistent that so many people

1982
01:29:05,491 --> 01:29:10,230
are willing to sell their health short
and the the the wide range of their

1983
01:29:10,231 --> 01:29:11,064
life,

1984
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,700
all the bad ears.
You can just get him read and write out

1985
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:17,430
them and enjoy your life is cigarettes.
People say that's what they always say,

1986
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:18,780
right?
That's the excuse.

1987
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:22,140
I mean I have a bit about it but there's
like some kind of science where they say

1988
01:29:22,141 --> 01:29:25,080
like every tie,
every pack of cigarettes takes off like

1989
01:29:25,081 --> 01:29:27,000
30 minutes off of your life or something
like that.

1990
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:31,830
They figured out what the averages and
then so then if you figure out how many

1991
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:33,030
years you smoke,
then you were like,

1992
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,670
yeah,
I don't want to live to be 100 so I'll

1993
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:37,940
live to be 77 that's fine.
Dot.

1994
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:40,730
There's a bunch of those bits out there.
Yeah.

1995
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:45,210
That are exactly the same as that.
But right now might be my bit was a,

1996
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,670
yeah,
it takes 30 minutes off your life.

1997
01:29:47,671 --> 01:29:49,560
Fuck that.
I'll just wake up an hour early every

1998
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:51,000
day and have two packs,
you know,

1999
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:54,810
red band man,
that's funny.

2000
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,950
But um,
the um,

2001
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:58,150
the other premise though,
I was like,

2002
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:00,620
well that's a beat and premise,
the premise of it,

2003
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,050
but what,
what am I going to miss?

2004
01:30:02,051 --> 01:30:04,300
Drooling and shitting myself and I'm
bummed.

2005
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,450
That was one of those things.
It's the last 20,

2006
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,100
like there was a bunch of people that
did that.

2007
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:09,631
Yeah,
there's a,

2008
01:30:09,631 --> 01:30:13,800
there's a few bits that,
that I have retired and it's just

2009
01:30:13,801 --> 01:30:15,360
amazing how,
you know,

2010
01:30:15,361 --> 01:30:17,730
with this all this amy Schumer stuff and
all that.

2011
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:21,000
I saw a girl,
I met a girl the other day,

2012
01:30:21,001 --> 01:30:24,060
I didn't even know she was a comic and
she told me her website.

2013
01:30:24,061 --> 01:30:27,420
And so later after I hung out with her,
I went home,

2014
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,460
went to our website and she's just a new
comic.

2015
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:33,630
Opened up her front page on the front
page yet a video press play.

2016
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,510
It was almost word for word,
one of my bits.

2017
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:37,710
And I was just like,
wow,

2018
01:30:37,711 --> 01:30:40,590
that's how easy it is.
She's never seen me.

2019
01:30:40,591 --> 01:30:42,150
I've never seen her,
you know,

2020
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:45,660
we've never met,
I've only done that bit a few times.

2021
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:49,350
But how she said it was almost exactly
how I wrote it.

2022
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:53,950
There's definitely going to be cases
that there's no way around it and it's

2023
01:30:53,951 --> 01:30:55,180
totally normal.
You know,

2024
01:30:55,181 --> 01:30:58,330
Kurt Metzger had a real good point about
it and he's one of the guys who's

2025
01:30:58,331 --> 01:31:02,050
involved in this whole thing,
who's the head writer of amy show and he

2026
01:31:02,051 --> 01:31:05,430
said that there's oftentimes,
and it's,

2027
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:09,940
it's,
it's a fact that people write the exact

2028
01:31:09,941 --> 01:31:13,690
same premise and they have no idea.
They write a completely independently.

2029
01:31:13,691 --> 01:31:16,000
They know,
they wrote it independently and then

2030
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:18,370
they'll see it on something and it'd
already been done.

2031
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,700
Oh No.
Happens all the time.

2032
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:24,820
Because if you can see funny in
something other people could see funny

2033
01:31:24,821 --> 01:31:25,540
or something,
it's not,

2034
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:28,180
we're not talking about some insane,
bizarre,

2035
01:31:28,181 --> 01:31:29,850
Esoteric,
um,

2036
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:33,560
Mr show with bob and Dave sketch.
Like they had some really busy,

2037
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:36,280
if you stole one of those sketches,
like dude,

2038
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:40,660
it's pretty obvious that this,
they had like really bizarre original

2039
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:41,170
subjects.

2040
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:43,720
It's very strange show and the way it's
seamless,

2041
01:31:43,721 --> 01:31:48,490
it goes from one scene to the next and
one each show is like an entire piece.

2042
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:49,900
It's all connected.
It's,

2043
01:31:49,901 --> 01:31:52,180
if you're seeing the new show,
the Netflix one,

2044
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:53,200
it's amazing.
It's great,

2045
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:54,400
it's really,
really good.

2046
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:58,570
But if you're just dealing with like
standard subjects like sex and,

2047
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,440
and marriage and diseases and work and
drinking and you know,

2048
01:32:04,661 --> 01:32:07,150
whatever the fuck his sketches on just
normal stuff,

2049
01:32:07,151 --> 01:32:10,870
normal life stuff.
If you other people talk about that too.

2050
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,950
And especially with sketches.
Do you have any fucking sketches had

2051
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:16,240
been put out?
I,

2052
01:32:16,241 --> 01:32:17,950
we were thinking about this because of
this whole thing.

2053
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:20,530
Think about all the,
as of Saturday night live,

2054
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:22,660
Saturday night live has been on for how
many years?

2055
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:23,970
What is it like 30,
30,

2056
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:25,180
30 years.
Okay,

2057
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:28,150
so 30 years of 52 weeks a year.

2058
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:30,700
How many weeks are they up though?
They were up every week.

2059
01:32:30,870 --> 01:32:33,690
Now they do seasons.
Just seasons.

2060
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:35,120
Okay.
Um,

2061
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,680
so just whatever the number is,
33 or something like that and probably

2062
01:32:38,681 --> 01:32:41,110
more,
probably more to think of all those

2063
01:32:41,111 --> 01:32:43,590
years of sketches in each one of them is
what?

2064
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:46,090
How long has it an hour and a half so I
don't live as long.

2065
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:47,890
Right Aaron?
Half hour and a half.

2066
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:51,070
How many fucking sketches is that over
all those years?

2067
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:55,750
It's hundreds and hundreds of premises
and then you have mad tv which went on

2068
01:32:55,751 --> 01:32:59,080
forever.
People Forgot Mad TV went on forever and

2069
01:32:59,081 --> 01:33:01,930
they had some great fucking premises.
Think about how many premises they

2070
01:33:01,931 --> 01:33:04,040
burned or used,
you know,

2071
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:07,270
you know they burned off meaning you
can't use them anymore because the

2072
01:33:07,271 --> 01:33:10,600
sketch has already been done.
Like there's so many of them and you can

2073
01:33:10,601 --> 01:33:15,601
come up with the same ideas completely
independently and you think that you're,

2074
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:17,170
you're a fucking trailblazer.

2075
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,160
You're like,
Oh man,

2076
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:20,650
I don't think that's the case of Amy
Schumer's stuff though.

2077
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,860
You don't know because there were
multiple sketches from the same sketch.

2078
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,320
You know what I mean?
Like there's like the slap thing.

2079
01:33:26,321 --> 01:33:30,550
The other thing that what I think should
should find out if Kurtz headed

2080
01:33:30,551 --> 01:33:32,620
brighter,
he said she find out who's the one that

2081
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:35,350
took that are wrote that sketch and you
know what I mean?

2082
01:33:35,351 --> 01:33:39,310
And maybe hold that person responsible.
You know?

2083
01:33:39,311 --> 01:33:44,311
And it is entirely possible that people
could come up with either one of those

2084
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:49,190
things independently and it's entirely
possible.

2085
01:33:49,191 --> 01:33:51,280
Absolutely.
Where it gets weird is that they're both

2086
01:33:51,281 --> 01:33:54,520
back to back in the exact same order and
that's where it gets weird.

2087
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:57,460
So is it possible for that to happen?
Yeah,

2088
01:33:57,461 --> 01:33:59,050
it's totally possible.
It's all,

2089
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:04,930
I think he put it best when he was
criticizing his own show.

2090
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,880
He's like,
if we're guilty of anything,

2091
01:34:06,881 --> 01:34:09,340
we're guilty of being hacky.
He goes,

2092
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,230
it's Kinda a lot of the stuff's kind of
hacky.

2093
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:14,190
It's true though that some of those
sketches,

2094
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:15,190
I mean,
yeah,

2095
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:16,001
it's true.
It's hacking bag.

2096
01:34:16,001 --> 01:34:18,940
That's not true of what happened in this
case because these are multiple

2097
01:34:18,941 --> 01:34:21,760
incidences of this same like as an
example,

2098
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:25,310
the slap shep and the shake.
You think that's too right?

2099
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:27,730
That's not the thing is that they're
back to back.

2100
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:30,970
They're back to makes it weird because
you've seen the flintstones thing,

2101
01:34:30,971 --> 01:34:31,710
right?
Yes.

2102
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:34,090
So the slap chef,
um,

2103
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:35,051
the,
uh,

2104
01:34:35,051 --> 01:34:37,790
the Kathleen Madigan joke,
although I know Kathleen,

2105
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:40,090
she's hilarious and I'm sure she came up
with it on her own.

2106
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:45,520
She probably didn't know that that had
been a part of the flintstones probably

2107
01:34:45,521 --> 01:34:48,940
forgot it or never saw it or who knows.
That magician thing almost copied

2108
01:34:48,941 --> 01:34:49,420
exactly.

2109
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:53,710
Almost exactly the same order.
The black girl in or that black person

2110
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:56,170
at the retail store where the,
you know,

2111
01:34:56,171 --> 01:34:59,090
that Keenan Peele or whatever,
it doesn't look good.

2112
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:00,580
Yeah.
No,

2113
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,340
it wasn't a key and Peele,
it was her,

2114
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,160
they were on mad tv actually at the
time.

2115
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:05,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

2116
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:05,840
No,
it doesn't look good.

2117
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:07,190
No.
I mean it doesn't look good,

2118
01:35:07,191 --> 01:35:09,230
but,
but what I think I,

2119
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,130
you know,
she's,

2120
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:12,010
I don't think she's guilty.
I think she did.

2121
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:15,350
It was writers and I think she needs to,
you know,

2122
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:16,760
kind of stand up and be like,
look,

2123
01:35:16,761 --> 01:35:21,730
it wasn't me and this guy stole two bits
and this guy stole two bits and we're,

2124
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:26,340
we're assuming it did.
But allegedly the problem is like,

2125
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,780
first of all for her,
she's in the worst position,

2126
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,040
right?
Because,

2127
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:32,630
um,
it's her show,

2128
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,850
she's got her name on it.
But if I was this,

2129
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:36,650
I've looked at this like completely,
honestly,

2130
01:35:36,651 --> 01:35:37,311
I,
there's little,

2131
01:35:37,311 --> 01:35:41,030
as I watched sketch comedy,
I didn't know that any of those bits had

2132
01:35:41,031 --> 01:35:41,864
been done before.

2133
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:43,790
I didn't know that the,
um,

2134
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:45,890
all of them,
so pretty much all of them I didn't

2135
01:35:45,891 --> 01:35:49,460
know.
So if somebody has tried to sell those

2136
01:35:49,461 --> 01:35:50,720
to me,
I'd be like,

2137
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:51,620
oh,
that's a good sketch.

2138
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:54,560
Like,
so I guess every time a sketch comes up,

2139
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:57,080
you got to enter that premise into
google.

2140
01:35:57,081 --> 01:35:58,970
A Jim Norton and I were just talking
about this weekend.

2141
01:35:58,971 --> 01:36:00,710
Like how do you,
like if you,

2142
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:03,170
if you're writing like hundreds and
hundreds of sketches,

2143
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:04,491
you know,
if you're,

2144
01:36:04,491 --> 01:36:06,260
if you're doing like a siren lime or
something like that,

2145
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:08,870
how do you find out whether or not this
premise has been done before?

2146
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:10,870
It's it,
you don't have to worry about it.

2147
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,700
What you have to do is do your own
version of that premise.

2148
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:17,630
But like in this case if you'd like the
magician was exact rim off.

2149
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:20,510
It was,
it was like buying a fake iphone from

2150
01:36:20,511 --> 01:36:21,590
Korea or China.

2151
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:26,640
It wasn't a premise that they both
played around and it was an exact rip

2152
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:27,650
off.
You know,

2153
01:36:27,651 --> 01:36:29,630
it was almost filmed.
Exactly.

2154
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:33,770
Let's say it was the exact same sketch
and the exact same order,

2155
01:36:33,771 --> 01:36:38,771
whether it was a rip off those,
it's hard to say whether someone,

2156
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:42,350
unless they come out and say,
Hey,

2157
01:36:42,351 --> 01:36:44,840
I saw that guy do it and that's where I
came up with a bed.

2158
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,670
And uh,
I tried to pretend that I wrote it

2159
01:36:46,671 --> 01:36:48,890
myself.
Unless they come out and say that it's

2160
01:36:48,891 --> 01:36:53,270
so hard to figure out what's going on.
Just being completely fair.

2161
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:56,480
It's always hard.
The problem is is there's multiple

2162
01:36:56,481 --> 01:36:58,880
instances.
I get it.

2163
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:00,770
I get it.
I agree.

2164
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:03,220
Those premises though.
Hmm.

2165
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,670
There's a few of them that,
that are pretty original.

2166
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:10,760
I thought the counter guy,
you'll like her not being able to talk

2167
01:37:10,761 --> 01:37:13,160
to the black guy was pretty original
but,

2168
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:16,490
but
who the fuck knows?

2169
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:17,990
Man?
Who knows?

2170
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:21,320
It just sits possible.
If one person came up with that,

2171
01:37:21,321 --> 01:37:23,300
another person could come up with the
same thing,

2172
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,110
just you don't know.
And the,

2173
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:30,190
the real problem lies.
And when people lie and steal and then

2174
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:32,900
pretend they didn't.
So if someone is,

2175
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,281
you know,
you,

2176
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:36,110
you have bit,
it's a killer bit.

2177
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:38,270
And this guy just swipes it and starts
doing it.

2178
01:37:38,271 --> 01:37:38,691
He goes,
dude,

2179
01:37:38,691 --> 01:37:40,580
I came up with the exact same bed.
I'm so sorry.

2180
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,130
And then starts doing it.
Well then you've got an ethical problem,

2181
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,100
then you've got a real problem.
But if you both come up with the same

2182
01:37:46,101 --> 01:37:49,550
bit,
like a tell is probably the best at it.

2183
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:51,980
And uh,
one of the things to Norton and I were

2184
01:37:51,981 --> 01:37:56,010
talking about like a tail will go up to
everybody when he has a a new bit.

2185
01:37:56,011 --> 01:37:59,310
If it seems like it came too easy,
if he's like,

2186
01:37:59,311 --> 01:38:00,390
where'd that come from?
Is that,

2187
01:38:00,391 --> 01:38:01,470
if I heard this before,
he'll like,

2188
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,470
he'll text you,
hey man,

2189
01:38:02,471 --> 01:38:04,880
have you heard this before?
He'll call you like,

2190
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:07,920
he's real diligent about that.
And if somebody else already has one,

2191
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,400
just chucks it aside.
And I think,

2192
01:38:11,401 --> 01:38:14,400
um,
that's the probably the best way to be.

2193
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:19,650
Just do what you think is original and,
uh,

2194
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:23,400
try to find out if anybody's already
done,

2195
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,290
I guess.
But how the fuck do you do that?

2196
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,780
See what I do is,
or what I try to do,

2197
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:29,430
I,
I've always tried to do this,

2198
01:38:29,431 --> 01:38:31,740
you know,
except for you or,

2199
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:35,430
or gone barris or brody Stevens,
theirs.

2200
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:38,700
I don't watch comedy.
I don't like watching other comics.

2201
01:38:38,701 --> 01:38:43,110
I don't want to be influenced by it.
And I think if you has a comic,

2202
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:46,290
if you follow that kind of rural where
you're not really watching comedy,

2203
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:48,180
even if he did come up at the same
presence,

2204
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:50,280
you could,
you could say with a straight face,

2205
01:38:50,281 --> 01:38:51,780
look,
I've never seen you.

2206
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,470
I don't watch comedy.
I,

2207
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:54,960
that's what I thought of.
You know,

2208
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:57,480
that's true.
But you definitely look at it that way.

2209
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:59,790
And there's,
but there's other comics that you always

2210
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:01,380
see in the back of the room.
They love comedy,

2211
01:39:01,381 --> 01:39:02,660
like watching comedy.
Right.

2212
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,530
You know,
and so if that happened to somebody like

2213
01:39:04,531 --> 01:39:05,011
that,
you'd be like,

2214
01:39:05,011 --> 01:39:06,990
Dude,
you've watched me do that.

2215
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:08,700
Joke 500 times.
Right.

2216
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:13,120
But that's why I would have to tell you
like in certain circumstances like jokes

2217
01:39:13,121 --> 01:39:15,790
that are like really common,
like um,

2218
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:18,490
like the one that you did know that was
really common about,

2219
01:39:18,491 --> 01:39:19,720
um,
uh,

2220
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:21,820
the last 20 years.
Like what do you like,

2221
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:25,030
what years are you missing?
Like what if you smoke cigarettes?

2222
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:27,020
It 20 years off your life.
Yeah.

2223
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:28,510
I like your take on it though.
You're taking on,

2224
01:39:28,511 --> 01:39:31,330
it's pretty funny cause it's,
it's a ridiculous red band math

2225
01:39:31,331 --> 01:39:33,640
equation.
It's like 30 minutes a day.

2226
01:39:33,641 --> 01:39:34,940
Just wake up an hour early,
you know?

2227
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:38,050
Exactly.
It's a ridiculous read bad math

2228
01:39:38,051 --> 01:39:39,400
equation.
But um,

2229
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,910
can you,
can you copy write jokes?

2230
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:45,010
I mean I know you can't,
I'm looking at it right now.

2231
01:39:45,011 --> 01:39:46,960
You can.
But like what'd you have?

2232
01:39:46,961 --> 01:39:48,690
You are like,
have you heard of someone doing it?

2233
01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:50,160
I think,
look,

2234
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,890
there's a lot of us,
man.

2235
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:54,680
I mean if you,
if you think about all the standup

2236
01:39:54,681 --> 01:39:58,040
comics in the world,
there's probably thousands of us,

2237
01:39:58,041 --> 01:40:00,200
right?
And for the most part there's very few

2238
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:02,240
problems.
And one of the reasons why there's very

2239
01:40:02,241 --> 01:40:07,241
few problems is cause we kind of police
ourselves and we make it a big point

2240
01:40:07,790 --> 01:40:10,850
about being fair and about,
you know,

2241
01:40:10,851 --> 01:40:14,270
supporting artists that don't do it.
And,

2242
01:40:14,271 --> 01:40:16,370
uh,
not supporting artists who do do it.

2243
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,840
And it doesn't mean just because someone
has done it in the past too,

2244
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:24,350
it doesn't mean that they're a terrible
person that can never redeem themselves.

2245
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:26,420
They can never know.
It doesn't mean that at all.

2246
01:40:26,421 --> 01:40:28,520
It means they fucked up.
People fuck up.

2247
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:29,700
People make mistakes.
He doesn't it,

2248
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,830
there were police itself,
kind of like the comedians that'll take

2249
01:40:32,831 --> 01:40:33,664
care of itself.

2250
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,330
I think more than anything,
man.

2251
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:38,640
It's comedy fans that are policing it
now.

2252
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,760
It's a really interesting,
and,

2253
01:40:40,761 --> 01:40:45,720
and I say fans and I use it in a loose
term possible cause some of them are

2254
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:48,420
actual fans.
The person they're going after and some

2255
01:40:48,421 --> 01:40:50,190
of them are just not,
you know,

2256
01:40:50,191 --> 01:40:51,570
some of 'em,
uh,

2257
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:56,400
they've been looking some reason why
this person is no good for awhile.

2258
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:59,020
And then when they find this,
they just go wild with it and they love

2259
01:40:59,021 --> 01:41:00,280
it.
Um,

2260
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:02,770
so they're not necessarily fans of the
person.

2261
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:07,240
So if they're making a video about her,
they're not necessarily fans of her,

2262
01:41:07,241 --> 01:41:09,700
but they might call themselves comedy
fans,

2263
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:11,740
you know?
And so they see something like this

2264
01:41:11,741 --> 01:41:16,210
happen and they get furious.
Just have to be real careful because

2265
01:41:16,211 --> 01:41:18,330
it's theirs.
It's,

2266
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,860
it's,
there's a giant issue with it being a

2267
01:41:20,861 --> 01:41:23,710
bunch of people writing on a show and
doing sketches,

2268
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:26,590
it's so fucking hard to know where those
things are coming from.

2269
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:28,870
It's just real hard to know.

2270
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,960
It's interesting though that it always
seems to happen,

2271
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,200
you know,
like,

2272
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,570
like yeah,
the mind Admin,

2273
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:37,950
Sia,
you got amy Schumer's show you,

2274
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:43,510
I saw the other day at John Heffron bit
that made it up in keene peel.

2275
01:41:43,570 --> 01:41:44,860
Like it was almost,
yeah.

2276
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:50,130
And
it seems like that maybe that the people

2277
01:41:51,221 --> 01:41:55,120
that write for these kinds of shows
don't think it's that bad,

2278
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,550
especially since it's all the same
network.

2279
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:58,830
Well,
I think first of all,

2280
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,360
there's some people that,
right.

2281
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:05,400
And this isn't meant to hold standup
comics and some crazy high form of

2282
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:08,880
ethics and morality.
But there's some people that write on

2283
01:42:08,881 --> 01:42:13,881
shows that are not standup comedians.
And their ideas about ideas are

2284
01:42:14,071 --> 01:42:17,370
different than our ideas about our ideas
without,

2285
01:42:17,371 --> 01:42:20,700
what I mean by that is if they can get
away with it,

2286
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:24,960
some of them will pill for an idea,
whether it's take it from a book and

2287
01:42:24,961 --> 01:42:26,580
rearrange it,
uh,

2288
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:31,050
take it from a video and transcribe it
and don't give the person credit who

2289
01:42:31,051 --> 01:42:35,970
said it the first time when,
when people are taking jokes from

2290
01:42:35,971 --> 01:42:39,240
comedians and using them to create
sketches with them and pretending that

2291
01:42:39,241 --> 01:42:41,550
they came up with them on their own,
it's,

2292
01:42:41,551 --> 01:42:42,570
um,
no,

2293
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:44,280
it's not,
it's not cool.

2294
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:46,470
Right?
It's fucking gross.

2295
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,650
But they're not,
they probably aren't comedians.

2296
01:42:49,770 --> 01:42:54,770
So it's like if you had like a really
funny line for a joke that was a lyric

2297
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:57,780
of a song,
you know,

2298
01:42:57,781 --> 01:42:59,490
and you heard a song and you're like,
Ooh,

2299
01:42:59,491 --> 01:43:00,930
I'm going to put this in my act that's
going to,

2300
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:06,260
I'm going to have this amazing punchline
in my act that is from this song.

2301
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,830
So like the joke in the song,
now I'm going to pretend I came up with

2302
01:43:10,831 --> 01:43:12,150
it on my own,
putting my act.

2303
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:14,550
It's like similar in that kind of a way.
You know what I'm saying?

2304
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:17,220
Absolutely.
So like someone who's not a comic,

2305
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:18,450
they,
I don't want to think,

2306
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:21,150
I wonder if they would then not even a
part of the comedy community,

2307
01:43:21,151 --> 01:43:24,960
they were a writer like fuck,
this dude is going to gang get shit.

2308
01:43:25,130 --> 01:43:26,760
Yeah.
Just going to fill it.

2309
01:43:26,761 --> 01:43:29,730
Just going to become productive.
What are the odds these people going to

2310
01:43:29,731 --> 01:43:34,140
watch an old 20 years episode of what's
happening?

2311
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:35,760
You know,
our 40 years,

2312
01:43:35,761 --> 01:43:37,920
how long ago was that on a long time
ago,

2313
01:43:37,921 --> 01:43:39,360
right?
Who the fuck's gonna Watch what's

2314
01:43:39,361 --> 01:43:41,100
happening and to go over all those
premises?

2315
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:43,680
No,
there might be a hilarious premise that

2316
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:46,770
they could pull out of that.
Why did I say what's happening?

2317
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:49,020
What's happening with that terrible.
Your sketches.

2318
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,500
I was trying to think of something like
a old Sitcom,

2319
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:53,610
Huh?

2320
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:54,443
True.

2321
01:43:56,130 --> 01:43:59,250
One thing I always thought was
interesting is because it just from

2322
01:43:59,251 --> 01:44:04,251
watching so many roast battles and stuff
like that is how roast jokes are like

2323
01:44:05,071 --> 01:44:10,071
the same jokes that they've used for
years and years and years and years just

2324
01:44:10,591 --> 01:44:14,310
kind of rebranded and like,
and it used to be totally acceptable.

2325
01:44:14,311 --> 01:44:17,340
Before there was internet,
before there was TV shows,

2326
01:44:17,341 --> 01:44:19,560
you know,
like the friars club and all that stuff

2327
01:44:19,561 --> 01:44:22,470
like that.
They're all kind of like taken from each

2328
01:44:22,471 --> 01:44:26,400
other and reusing shit that Charlie
Chaplin may have said.

2329
01:44:26,401 --> 01:44:30,990
You know?
And it's just interesting that that's

2330
01:44:30,991 --> 01:44:35,670
like one of the few things in comedy
that it's kind of like an unspoken

2331
01:44:35,671 --> 01:44:36,630
thing,
but who cares?

2332
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:37,360
You know,
like it's,

2333
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:40,770
it's no one's getting mad if you reuse a
roast joke that,

2334
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:43,750
that Milton Berle mom made,
you know,

2335
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:46,370
like around.
But they probably would if there were

2336
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:48,720
roast fans,
like Hinchcliffe would probably be mad

2337
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:50,910
because he's a roast fan.
Yeah.

2338
01:44:50,911 --> 01:44:54,600
When now with TV and stuff like that.
It's interesting because like if they

2339
01:44:54,601 --> 01:44:57,990
have like a roast,
like show on comedy central,

2340
01:44:57,991 --> 01:45:00,210
like,
so like amy or somebody does a joke on

2341
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:05,211
that and they reuse it and that roast
few years later that now it's like,

2342
01:45:05,401 --> 01:45:06,480
oh,
you can't do that anymore.

2343
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:08,790
Even though he used to be able to do it.
And that was the whole thing,

2344
01:45:08,791 --> 01:45:09,370
you know,

2345
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:11,650
I wonder if that's what the whole thing
was.

2346
01:45:11,950 --> 01:45:13,690
Um,
I mean that's what it was in the

2347
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:15,400
catskills days.
Right.

2348
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:18,190
And the um,
the old days,

2349
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,233
they would,
uh,

2350
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:21,910
have these resorts like from dirty
dancing.

2351
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:23,260
That was the catskills.
Right.

2352
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:26,980
Other than it,
man,

2353
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:29,890
that's how fucked up cigarettes are.
Man.

2354
01:45:29,950 --> 01:45:32,920
Cigarettes took Patrick swayze.
Yeah.

2355
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:35,260
Dude,
we lost Patrick swayze to cigarettes.

2356
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:38,320
We lost the dude from roadhouse with the
flowing locks.

2357
01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:43,630
You know how to invest just alone.
Fluxes in the mirror every day.

2358
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:45,870
He's still alive.
He's like 70.

2359
01:45:45,871 --> 01:45:47,190
He looks great.
Yeah.

2360
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:51,270
Popular dirty dancing was and how
popular that soundtrack was that they

2361
01:45:51,271 --> 01:45:55,560
released a soundtrack like two months
after that had none of the music from

2362
01:45:55,561 --> 01:45:57,480
the movie,
but it was just called like dirty

2363
01:45:57,481 --> 01:46:01,040
dancing soundtrack part too.
It was just a way to sell another.

2364
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:06,210
But that is every girl's dream.
A beautiful man who can dance.

2365
01:46:06,631 --> 01:46:10,290
There's a really manly man who will
fight to defend his right to dance.

2366
01:46:12,210 --> 01:46:14,310
Is that correct?
Perfect cheekbones.

2367
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:17,010
If I say that to any other girl,
are you kidding me?

2368
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:19,200
This guy got God.
Get out of here.

2369
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:22,260
If I was a girl,
I'd have babies with that dude bodily.

2370
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:24,390
That's your guy a,
you're on vacation.

2371
01:46:24,391 --> 01:46:26,850
You meet this guy.
He's dangerous.

2372
01:46:26,851 --> 01:46:29,280
He's got perfect hair,
beautiful features.

2373
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:31,380
He's supple.
He knows how to move,

2374
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,000
smoked cigarettes.
He looks cool.

2375
01:46:34,140 --> 01:46:35,940
Cigarettes caught them.
Dude,

2376
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,950
Patrick swayze,
he's not that old.

2377
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:42,450
Do you understand like this,
this fucking guy died from cigarettes

2378
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:46,830
and he's not that old.
There's a lot of people that are way

2379
01:46:46,831 --> 01:46:51,831
older than him that are doing great.
And then there's women that have been

2380
01:46:51,961 --> 01:46:54,150
smoking two packs of cigarettes every
day,

2381
01:46:54,151 --> 01:46:55,660
spent their whole life and her 102.

2382
01:46:56,530 --> 01:46:58,800
Right.
But they look like monsters.

2383
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:03,450
It'll become monster.
I could just be come to their body

2384
01:47:03,451 --> 01:47:06,300
morphs and changes to accept the
cigarettes.

2385
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:08,580
When you're like a hundred and you're
still small,

2386
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:14,280
you're like some fucking cigarette
burning beast.

2387
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:18,510
Some thing that's in inhaling these,
this chemical that's a new part of your

2388
01:47:18,511 --> 01:47:21,330
system.
I've been spoken for about 26 years and

2389
01:47:21,331 --> 01:47:23,820
I look at like a fresh little baby.
You're a part of the system.

2390
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:28,240
You're in the matrix.
My by NBC.

2391
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:30,350
By him.
How many do you,

2392
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:33,350
how many do you do every day?
Like I'm like a pack.

2393
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:34,920
A pack.
Hold back a day.

2394
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:37,470
Wow.
But you know,

2395
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:39,930
sometimes it's more,
sometimes it's less.

2396
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,590
Uh,
I think that's another thing that made

2397
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:45,270
you on my podcast.
He's one of my neck that was him in the

2398
01:47:45,271 --> 01:47:49,980
bitter and he was still smoking.
His body was rotting away and he had a

2399
01:47:49,981 --> 01:47:51,510
cigarette hanging out of his mouth.

2400
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:54,310
It doesn't seem like a good idea to
continue to smoke.

2401
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,050
Look at that.
Look at him.

2402
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:00,540
Wow.
That's craziness.

2403
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:03,030
But it's weird because it was still
getting treatment.

2404
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:06,180
It's weird man.
I wonder if like he laid off of it for a

2405
01:48:06,181 --> 01:48:08,310
while,
man.

2406
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:12,090
It's sad one.
And he did a television show because he

2407
01:48:12,091 --> 01:48:13,260
was hot.
He was hot.

2408
01:48:13,261 --> 01:48:16,260
Wallace was all happening.
So he did a TV show and I'm sure that

2409
01:48:16,261 --> 01:48:20,010
didn't help him at the long hours and
the stress of that TV show.

2410
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,890
I forgot about that TV show.
Well what I don't remember,

2411
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:26,520
but um,
he uh,

2412
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:30,000
he went out the hard way.
Shit's real.

2413
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:32,340
That's what it was.
It was called the beast.

2414
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:34,650
2009.
Wow.

2415
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:36,620
Patrick swayze.
Dan,

2416
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:38,640
it's weird.
Roadhouse.

2417
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:40,500
Rest in peace.
He's a mother Fucker,

2418
01:48:40,501 --> 01:48:43,800
dude.
Roadhouses the shit to this day,

2419
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:45,240
right?
It's this date.

2420
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:47,340
If you're flipping channels and
roadhouses on,

2421
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:48,653
just watch it.

2422
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:50,280
Just watch it.
It's on.

2423
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,830
It's perfect.
It's a pretty classic movie.

2424
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:56,010
It's a slice of Americana.
It's like a piece of,

2425
01:48:56,720 --> 01:49:01,720
it's a piece of like civilization just
strapped into some cultural,

2426
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:05,750
iconic,
ridiculous.

2427
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:08,880
They just made another movie that was a
good one of his called point break,

2428
01:49:08,881 --> 01:49:10,530
which I heard.
I didn't see it,

2429
01:49:10,531 --> 01:49:13,530
but I heard it wasn't like great.
The premise wasn't even the same movie

2430
01:49:13,531 --> 01:49:15,030
though.
But are you worried about roadhouse

2431
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:17,050
coming back out and being totally
different kinds of things,

2432
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:17,850
isn't it?
Rhonda?

2433
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:19,830
Rhonda is going to do roadhouses it's
going to be different.

2434
01:49:19,831 --> 01:49:21,870
She has a vagina.
It's totally different.

2435
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:23,250
You see her on Saturday night live?
No,

2436
01:49:23,251 --> 01:49:25,410
I didn't see her.
It was good though.

2437
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:27,840
Did you hear it was good?
Uh,

2438
01:49:27,841 --> 01:49:31,620
you know,
certain people really invest in,

2439
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,510
in making it their own,
I think.

2440
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:36,270
And then there's other people that kind
of just go through the motions.

2441
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:37,530
Uh,
from what I saw,

2442
01:49:37,531 --> 01:49:38,880
it just seemed like the,
the ladder.

2443
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,070
Then it just seemed,
I don't know.

2444
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:43,410
She seemed like she did great job,
but she didn't like,

2445
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:44,930
she's not a public speaker.
Yeah.

2446
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:48,280
Probably hard as fuck to do someone that
isn't a public

2447
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,240
speaker.
Can you imagine?

2448
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:51,730
You know?
Yeah.

2449
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,000
I mean,
I wonder definitely,

2450
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:57,190
especially if you're not used to it,
but yeah,

2451
01:49:57,191 --> 01:49:58,840
it's an iconic thing to do,
man.

2452
01:49:58,841 --> 01:50:02,020
I'd be nervous as fuck all years I've
done stand up.

2453
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:04,120
If I had a host site live,
I'd be nervous as far.

2454
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:04,650
Yeah.

2455
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:05,483
Yeah.
Did you try?

2456
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,870
No.
Every assay we wouldn't do it.

2457
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,560
I'm not,
I'm not interested in working at beach.

2458
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:11,070
Just interesting though.
I've done,

2459
01:50:11,310 --> 01:50:14,280
I think I've done too much work.
I really do.

2460
01:50:14,430 --> 01:50:18,720
I'm interested in enjoying myself.
I just think at this stage of my life,

2461
01:50:18,750 --> 01:50:23,190
like the one I'm becoming more and more
cognizant of as I get older is you can

2462
01:50:23,191 --> 01:50:24,870
work too much.
It's not good.

2463
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:28,530
It's not good to work too much.
Like there's a good amount of work you

2464
01:50:28,531 --> 01:50:30,200
should do,
but there's a lot of people that like

2465
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:32,250
pride themselves and working too much
and working the,

2466
01:50:32,251 --> 01:50:34,500
wearing themselves out.
Like it's something they carry around

2467
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,690
like a shield,
you know that?

2468
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:38,130
Hmm.
Probably not.

2469
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:40,680
If you don't have to do it.
I understand if you have to do it,

2470
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:43,590
but if you don't have to do it,
she'd probably like have some fun.

2471
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:45,450
You know,
like don't,

2472
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:50,600
don't get overwhelmed with the desire to
succeed cause that your whole life could

2473
01:50:51,271 --> 01:50:51,900
pass you by.

2474
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,670
If you're one of those Gordon Gekko
assholes,

2475
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,710
you know,
your whole life can pass you by for some

2476
01:50:55,711 --> 01:50:58,290
crazy hedge funds.
Sociopath on the loose,

2477
01:50:58,291 --> 01:51:01,230
just sucking numbers out of the,
out of the matrix with his fucking

2478
01:51:01,231 --> 01:51:05,130
computer algorithms.
Like that guy is just connected to it.

2479
01:51:05,131 --> 01:51:06,600
He's a,
he's a part of it.

2480
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,330
So He's successful.
But along the way,

2481
01:51:09,331 --> 01:51:11,310
he's not even having any fun.
You know,

2482
01:51:11,311 --> 01:51:16,311
he's just living life in this constantly
stressed adderall induced s like speedy

2483
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:23,690
fucking decision making ass kicking
fucking mode all the time.

2484
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,670
You know,
that guy ain't happening.

2485
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:33,150
It's um,
it's so weird way to live life.

2486
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:38,580
So funny that somebody asked me the
other day if I can find them at all and

2487
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,720
I was like,
no,

2488
01:51:39,721 --> 01:51:41,370
I don't know anyone.
But if you need cocaine,

2489
01:51:41,371 --> 01:51:43,730
I can get that.
Like,

2490
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:47,700
like how weird is it that it is weird
backwards you've ever been?

2491
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,890
Why Whitewater rafting?
No,

2492
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:52,860
that's something that you should try
some type that's crazy.

2493
01:51:53,070 --> 01:51:56,310
Gone canoeing down the white waters.
Not White waters.

2494
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,050
I shouldn't even say white waters down a
river.

2495
01:51:58,590 --> 01:52:00,180
Um,
there were some tricky spots,

2496
01:52:00,181 --> 01:52:01,920
like some spots near rocks and stuff
like that,

2497
01:52:01,921 --> 01:52:05,550
but nothing like real fast.
The Whitewater stuff looks a phone.

2498
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:06,393
A newsroom.

2499
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:07,440
Yeah.
My,

2500
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:11,610
my dad almost died doing it once because
he got caught underneath the raft and he

2501
01:52:11,611 --> 01:52:13,710
said he couldn't breathe and he just
gave up.

2502
01:52:13,711 --> 01:52:15,630
And then they're at the last second.
We just floating down.

2503
01:52:15,631 --> 01:52:17,460
Somebody just grabbed him out of the
water.

2504
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:19,670
My Friend Remy Warren,
uh,

2505
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:23,340
who's done the podcast a few times,
not the last time that he was on,

2506
01:52:23,341 --> 01:52:26,340
but the time before that,
I think the first time he was on,

2507
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:27,743
he,
um,

2508
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:31,650
told me a story about,
he was a,

2509
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:36,750
in the woods and he saw a body come down
the river and the guy's face down in the

2510
01:52:37,471 --> 01:52:40,290
water.
He saw some clothes and uh,

2511
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:41,570
then he saw a,
like,

2512
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:42,660
you saw some gear,
you know,

2513
01:52:42,661 --> 01:52:45,920
floating down.
And then he saw a body and he realized,

2514
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:49,970
Oh shit.
And then he saw a woman and the woman

2515
01:52:49,971 --> 01:52:54,110
was bobbing her head up in the air and
trying to survive and getting caught up

2516
01:52:54,111 --> 01:52:57,230
in the current,
and he ran into that fucking water

2517
01:52:57,350 --> 01:53:00,230
thinking that he was going to die
thinking like this.

2518
01:53:00,231 --> 01:53:02,690
I just made the biggest mistake.
I'm going to try to help us,

2519
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:04,610
lady,
I'm going to wind up dying like,

2520
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:07,580
and he's a strong guy and he's a really,
he's in really good shape.

2521
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:09,770
He hikes a lot in the mountains.
He's very fit.

2522
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:10,820
Like they,
uh,

2523
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:13,130
for his television show.
Um,

2524
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:14,840
it's called us.
Um,

2525
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:17,180
uh,
what's it called?

2526
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:18,790
Apex Predator.
Um,

2527
01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:23,180
he did these vo two Max tests where they
made them do like sprints and find out,

2528
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:23,931
they find out,
he's like,

2529
01:53:23,931 --> 01:53:27,020
get a very high level of endurance just
cause he's constantly hiking in the

2530
01:53:27,021 --> 01:53:30,380
mountains,
but still he'd jump into the water and

2531
01:53:30,381 --> 01:53:32,210
you grab a hold of somebody,
they can drown you,

2532
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:35,300
they could flail and you might not
recover and you,

2533
01:53:35,301 --> 01:53:37,490
while you're flailing around,
you might hit a log.

2534
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:40,070
You're going down this water,
it's going really fast.

2535
01:53:40,071 --> 01:53:43,970
And what happened to these people was
they were doing that in a raft and the

2536
01:53:43,971 --> 01:53:48,920
current got really fast and they hit a
down tree and they got fucked up and the

2537
01:53:48,921 --> 01:53:52,190
dude drown and he died and the woman's
survived,

2538
01:53:52,191 --> 01:53:54,830
but barely,
and she was freezing to death.

2539
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:58,130
The water was insanely cold.
So this dude jumped in the water,

2540
01:53:58,131 --> 01:53:59,330
pulled them out.
Um,

2541
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:01,130
finally,
what number podcast is,

2542
01:54:01,131 --> 01:54:02,990
so we could tell people that are
listening to this right now,

2543
01:54:02,991 --> 01:54:05,810
but it's remy Warren.
I'm pretty sure it was the first time he

2544
01:54:05,811 --> 01:54:09,050
was on.
It's a constant famous country singer

2545
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:12,680
just died.
Kind of the same kind of situation for

2546
01:54:12,681 --> 01:54:16,760
39 with Dan duty,
episode four 39 with Dan Dodi.

2547
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,830
That's the one.
Yeah.

2548
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:21,080
We also have it re uploaded.
How many times did he come on by

2549
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:21,950
himself?
Oh,

2550
01:54:21,951 --> 01:54:23,420
it's up.
The stories uploaded.

2551
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:24,830
Oh,
beautiful.

2552
01:54:24,831 --> 01:54:27,650
Beautiful episode four 39.
He's awesome.

2553
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,780
That guy's a good dude.
Um,

2554
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:33,000
what was the question about this country
singer and the country singer?

2555
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:33,980
Like they found his,
uh,

2556
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:36,320
his body and it seem like the kind of
like a similar thing.

2557
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:36,951
He,
um,

2558
01:54:36,951 --> 01:54:38,360
yeah,
he died of hypothermia.

2559
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:39,860
They,
um,

2560
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:40,910
they,
they have,

2561
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:44,870
they were in a boat apparently,
and it just overturned and it was in the

2562
01:54:44,871 --> 01:54:46,790
water and the storm was insane.

2563
01:54:47,230 --> 01:54:48,110
And you know,
they uh,

2564
01:54:48,111 --> 01:54:50,930
they tried to risk it.
They tried to go out there and he even

2565
01:54:50,931 --> 01:54:54,020
made a tweet about it the night before,
you know,

2566
01:54:54,021 --> 01:54:56,960
saying he hopes it doesn't die.
Like,

2567
01:54:57,230 --> 01:55:00,200
man,
there's the storms are no fucking

2568
01:55:00,201 --> 01:55:01,820
bullshit.
They're no bullshit.

2569
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,690
Like there's a video that I posted today
that I retweeted,

2570
01:55:05,691 --> 01:55:09,410
that someone sent my way about
lightening striking.

2571
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:11,060
Oh,
it was a matt stags.

2572
01:55:11,061 --> 01:55:13,490
One Maths tag sent it to me.
Um,

2573
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:17,150
lightning striking in the middle of
this,

2574
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:18,920
like these,
the storm going on,

2575
01:55:18,921 --> 01:55:20,990
these guys are out on the patio.
And they were like,

2576
01:55:20,991 --> 01:55:21,950
wow,
this is crazy.

2577
01:55:21,951 --> 01:55:23,480
And the guy's like,
I wouldn't go out there and now with

2578
01:55:23,481 --> 01:55:25,280
this weather.
And then boom,

2579
01:55:25,281 --> 01:55:27,110
the lightning hits the ground right in
front of them.

2580
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:29,780
Play this shit.
Where do you see this?

2581
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:39,330
Hold on.
Don't go outside.

2582
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,580
Oh my God,
Dude.

2583
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:49,290
Shit myself.
First of all,

2584
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:52,650
fuck lightning.
Fuck lightning.

2585
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:57,810
Lightning is an asshole force of nature.
That is a shitty,

2586
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,680
dirty,
cheap shot and motherfucker,

2587
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:04,110
lightning is crazy.
There's no rules either.

2588
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:06,810
Remy Warren got hit by lightening too.
How about that?

2589
01:56:06,811 --> 01:56:09,900
I got to remy Warren Stories,
remy than when he was a kid in high

2590
01:56:09,901 --> 01:56:10,890
school.
Got Hit by lightning,

2591
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:12,690
woke up with his fucking ears going,

2592
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:14,500
hey,

2593
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,210
like he told that story on the podcast
as well.

2594
01:56:17,211 --> 01:56:20,210
I think that was the same story.
Goddamn Rami probably warrants amazing.

2595
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:22,160
That's,
that's what it all boils down to.

2596
01:56:22,190 --> 01:56:25,160
Remy is amazing.
Lightening hit right in front of me once

2597
01:56:25,161 --> 01:56:27,040
I was in the basement,
that's not the same as getting him

2598
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:27,973
right.
You know,

2599
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:29,540
it was going to hit and he was fucked
up.

2600
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:32,810
I was in the basement and they have
those windows in the basement.

2601
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,610
Uh,
like within that window wells and stuff

2602
01:56:34,611 --> 01:56:36,530
like that.
And I was doing my laundry or something

2603
01:56:36,531 --> 01:56:39,140
and uh,
lightening hit right in front of me

2604
01:56:39,170 --> 01:56:41,480
outside though.
And then like the arms,

2605
01:56:41,481 --> 01:56:43,880
a electricity like went all over there,
like everything.

2606
01:56:43,881 --> 01:56:45,470
And it's scary.
The shit out of me.

2607
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:49,700
Maybe it was actually an evil villain.
Teleporting from the future terminator

2608
01:56:49,701 --> 01:56:51,590
style.
Maybe you thought it was a lightening,

2609
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:53,930
right?
Remember that scene when Arnold was

2610
01:56:53,931 --> 01:56:56,640
naked?
Is giant Austrian schlonged hanging out

2611
01:56:56,641 --> 01:57:01,641
and give me all close.
Remember that that movie was the shit

2612
01:57:03,770 --> 01:57:04,521
be.
Meanwhile,

2613
01:57:04,521 --> 01:57:06,980
that's about to happen.
Automated cars.

2614
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:10,100
Fucking drones.
Look at this.

2615
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:16,400
That's what it was.
He just appears in that bubble.

2616
01:57:16,401 --> 01:57:18,380
That cut right through everything.
It was around it.

2617
01:57:18,980 --> 01:57:23,060
Remember like it was like a little
circle and it popped up and that red

2618
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:23,930
bag,
old deck,

2619
01:57:23,930 --> 01:57:27,920
especially like metal.
Why couldn't they give him some clothes?

2620
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:30,220
Why do you got to pretend that you can't
cut teleport close?

2621
01:57:30,230 --> 01:57:31,760
You fucks.
You know,

2622
01:57:31,850 --> 01:57:33,440
is it gotta be naked?
You know,

2623
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:37,550
get Outta here.
What the fuck out of here with that?

2624
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:41,780
That's probably what it's going to be
though,

2625
01:57:41,781 --> 01:57:43,220
right?
It is probably going to be,

2626
01:57:43,221 --> 01:57:48,200
once they figured out teleporting,
you'd have to buy herself the first day

2627
01:57:48,201 --> 01:57:52,430
someone gets scrambled because there's a
glitch in the matrix when a teleporting

2628
01:57:52,431 --> 01:57:54,500
someone and they come out of bucket of
feet,

2629
01:57:55,290 --> 01:57:56,350
eyeballs,
balls and,

2630
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:59,330
and Dick's in their mouth and their
twisted like a pretzel.

2631
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:01,370
The first time that happens,
whoa,

2632
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:03,110
that's going to be a tough day.

2633
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:07,010
But we accept a certain amount of car
accidents.

2634
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:10,010
You know,
we accept thousands and thousands of car

2635
01:58:10,011 --> 01:58:12,590
accidents every year.
If you just think about how many people

2636
01:58:12,591 --> 01:58:17,591
die if we were thinking like our real
enemy is the automobile.

2637
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:20,390
Automobiles are killing people with know
people driving them,

2638
01:58:20,391 --> 01:58:23,390
but God won't be hitting into people,
people hitting things in their

2639
01:58:23,391 --> 01:58:25,250
automobiles.
That's what's killing people.

2640
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:28,010
If you really looked at it that way,
the numbers are pretty high.

2641
01:58:28,190 --> 01:58:31,220
I think it's like 30,000 people or
something crazy die in automobile

2642
01:58:31,221 --> 01:58:32,900
accidents every year.
Yeah.

2643
01:58:32,950 --> 01:58:34,130
Mean if that was a,
uh,

2644
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:35,750
an enemy,
you know,

2645
01:58:35,751 --> 01:58:38,150
robot enemy,
I came from space,

2646
01:58:38,210 --> 01:58:39,680
it was killing him.
30,000 people a day.

2647
01:58:39,681 --> 01:58:41,530
We wouldn't be so fucking nonchalant it,

2648
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,960
you know,
but because we're driving around,

2649
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:46,180
oh,
the fly he doing teleportation and that

2650
01:58:46,181 --> 01:58:47,250
way you ask.
Yes.

2651
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:52,120
Well that was he,
this was actually a remake of a really

2652
01:58:52,121 --> 01:58:55,720
old movie from the black and white days.
It was awesome.

2653
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:59,170
It was really awesome.
Go find the old fly.

2654
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:00,550
Yeah,
I need to rewatch that.

2655
01:59:00,551 --> 01:59:05,551
It's but the fly,
the 19 it was at 86 88 86 for that first

2656
01:59:05,711 --> 01:59:06,544
one.
But here's the other one.

2657
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:07,210
Oh,
okay.

2658
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:11,230
So for the Jeff Goldbloom one,
it's fucking awesome.

2659
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:13,180
It's really good.
I loved it.

2660
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:16,780
Jeff Goldbloom was such a bad
motherfucker when he was young man.

2661
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:21,040
Especially in that movie.
Like I really believed that's the

2662
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:24,310
original is that Vincent Price.
That's amazing.

2663
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:28,570
Look at that.
That's a crazy look at the fucking

2664
01:59:28,571 --> 01:59:30,220
picture.
Oh my God.

2665
01:59:30,221 --> 01:59:33,680
Vincent Price.
He was the man when it came to old

2666
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:37,360
school monster movies.
But like Jeff Goldbloom and that fly

2667
01:59:37,361 --> 01:59:39,730
movie,
you believe that he was really a mad

2668
01:59:39,731 --> 01:59:40,564
scientist.

2669
01:59:40,890 --> 01:59:42,610
Like I believe like this guy,
the way he talks,

2670
01:59:42,611 --> 01:59:45,040
he's just so,
do you have friend and interesting.

2671
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:47,300
He the,
he had a way of talking about and be

2672
01:59:47,301 --> 01:59:49,270
like,
this guy could be some hyper human who

2673
01:59:49,271 --> 01:59:51,760
could figure something like this out.
I totally bought it.

2674
01:59:51,761 --> 01:59:52,720
Hook,
line and sinker.

2675
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:56,170
Like there's some people that play,
they play scientists and I'm like,

2676
01:59:56,370 --> 01:59:58,760
bitch,
you ain't fucking some right.

2677
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:01,840
Come on son.
You ever see that movie sunset

2678
02:00:01,841 --> 02:00:02,920
boulevard?
We have that.

2679
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,600
Where's this dog?
Yeah,

2680
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:08,050
way different.
I bet he's got a giant dog.

2681
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:10,090
Look at his conference.
We look at his face.

2682
02:00:10,091 --> 02:00:12,100
Large hands,
but it's a hog.

2683
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:13,360
Yeah.
He's got a huge tick.

2684
02:00:13,361 --> 02:00:16,810
You can tell it's crazy in a fly.
Let a fly in there.

2685
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:19,850
You ever see sunset boulevard?
No.

2686
02:00:19,851 --> 02:00:21,010
What was a,
that's a great movie.

2687
02:00:21,011 --> 02:00:22,330
I highly recommend I watch it.

2688
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:25,630
That's my go to like I put on every
night before I go to bed.

2689
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:27,030
That's not the,
uh,

2690
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,950
the document documentary or a drama
mentoree or whatever they're calling it.

2691
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:32,650
[inaudible] no,
this is a movie,

2692
02:00:32,651 --> 02:00:34,390
but yeah,
this is an old school classic.

2693
02:00:34,391 --> 02:00:37,390
Maybe school.
Wasn't there a recent movie about

2694
02:00:37,391 --> 02:00:38,260
sunset?
Yeah,

2695
02:00:38,261 --> 02:00:40,930
that was the documentary about sunset.
It was a documentary.

2696
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:42,420
It was documentary.
Okay.

2697
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:44,800
So there was no acting in it at all.
Okay.

2698
02:00:44,801 --> 02:00:47,410
I got confused.
There's more than one that was out at

2699
02:00:47,411 --> 02:00:49,550
the same time.
One was a,

2700
02:00:49,551 --> 02:00:52,070
a film.
Uh,

2701
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:54,010
no,
I think it's the same one.

2702
02:00:54,011 --> 02:00:56,770
I think it's,
I keep hearing I have to check that out

2703
02:00:56,771 --> 02:00:58,390
though.
The documentary.

2704
02:00:58,430 --> 02:00:58,841
Yeah.
Yeah.

2705
02:00:58,841 --> 02:01:00,910
It's good.
It's interesting you really learned

2706
02:01:00,911 --> 02:01:02,500
about the sunset boulevard.
You know,

2707
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:05,840
I was talking,
I was on Frasier's a radio show the

2708
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:06,610
other day,
and we raise your Smith.

2709
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:08,620
Yeah,
I love frazier since great guy.

2710
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:09,910
Uh,
he,

2711
02:01:09,911 --> 02:01:10,690
uh,
you know,

2712
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:12,900
there's not much left on sunset.
We were talking,

2713
02:01:12,901 --> 02:01:15,880
you know,
besides the rainbow and the comedy

2714
02:01:15,881 --> 02:01:17,110
story,
there's not much.

2715
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:18,730
Uh,
that's it.

2716
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:21,490
Everything's getting torn down and
become condos now.

2717
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:27,810
It's almost dead.
Dita von Teese rat slabs.

2718
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:28,461
Let's get,
go.

2719
02:01:28,461 --> 02:01:30,070
Go for the first time on Friday.
Oh,

2720
02:01:30,071 --> 02:01:32,080
really?
Pricing really small and like,

2721
02:01:32,110 --> 02:01:32,980
yeah,
I mean,

2722
02:01:32,981 --> 02:01:36,040
it would have been awesome to see Motley
crue and Jimi Hendrix or anyone in the

2723
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:39,530
doors back in the day.
But I saw a band saw for the time when I

2724
02:01:39,531 --> 02:01:42,380
was a teenager in high school orgy.
And Whoa,

2725
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:44,630
I saw there on the billboard.
So I went and saw him and it was a,

2726
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:48,430
I probably should have just stayed home.
That's where it led me.

2727
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:51,440
Birthday party was great.
Before you do that,

2728
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:53,810
the roxy and the,
um,

2729
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:55,460
the place next to it,
the rainbow,

2730
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:57,730
that's,
those are icons span.

2731
02:01:57,860 --> 02:01:59,480
You have rainbows,
an icon.

2732
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:03,320
The rainbow feels like it was made by
the same person as the comedy store.

2733
02:02:03,321 --> 02:02:06,290
You go in there and you go like,
I feel like insane.

2734
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:09,380
It's a legit old school,
Hollywood place.

2735
02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:13,340
You ever eat at Dantanna's Dantanna's on
Santa Monica.

2736
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:16,460
Dude.
So you'll go into the past like the

2737
02:02:16,461 --> 02:02:18,020
menus,
the way the waiters are dressed.

2738
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,230
Well,
it's all really small,

2739
02:02:21,231 --> 02:02:23,330
but it's not giant.
One side's more of a bar,

2740
02:02:23,331 --> 02:02:25,970
but there's tables on that side.
But the food is amazing.

2741
02:02:26,570 --> 02:02:29,960
The food is incredible and it's like so
old school man.

2742
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,970
The whole place is just,
it feels it.

2743
02:02:31,971 --> 02:02:33,800
When you get in there,
you feel like you got class.

2744
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:36,110
Like you want to order a Martini age to
be an asshole.

2745
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:40,640
Like C'mon gentlemen.
That's right next to the shipping door

2746
02:02:40,641 --> 02:02:44,150
on sunset.
Coolest place I've ever seen a concert

2747
02:02:44,151 --> 02:02:46,610
and my really,
really been to red rocks,

2748
02:02:46,611 --> 02:02:49,130
which I've heard is also a cool,
that's a big place to see in Denver.

2749
02:02:49,130 --> 02:02:53,420
But as far as small venue where you can
see like a real awesome concert with

2750
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:56,510
maybe 200 people,
but real big names play there

2751
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:58,070
frequently.
It just for fun.

2752
02:02:58,071 --> 02:03:00,320
That's like where they work out.
That's awesome man.

2753
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:02,720
God Damn.
Yeah,

2754
02:03:02,721 --> 02:03:04,520
it's a crazy spot.
That sunset strip.

2755
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:06,450
Yeah,
but you know,

2756
02:03:06,550 --> 02:03:09,140
it's on the way out.
It's becoming something different for

2757
02:03:09,141 --> 02:03:11,680
sure.
Like that giant billboard that's right

2758
02:03:11,681 --> 02:03:12,790
in front of store.
That's it's,

2759
02:03:13,230 --> 02:03:17,630
it's movies like who's idea is it could
take a fucking road that already has

2760
02:03:17,631 --> 02:03:22,550
plenty of accidents and put up a giant
fucking multicolored,

2761
02:03:22,551 --> 02:03:25,640
super bright billboard that you almost
need sunglasses to look at.

2762
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:29,090
And it's playing videos.
So you're watching videos as you're

2763
02:03:29,091 --> 02:03:29,691
driving.
Well,

2764
02:03:29,691 --> 02:03:30,530
what is this?
Well,

2765
02:03:30,531 --> 02:03:32,060
what's he doing?
Well that's wacky.

2766
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:34,400
He just do a flip crash.
Yeah.

2767
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:38,060
It should be so illegal to people.
You're not even allowed to text if

2768
02:03:38,061 --> 02:03:38,910
you're not a lot of texts.

2769
02:03:38,930 --> 02:03:40,330
Why are you allowed to read?
Why you got,

2770
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:43,100
why do you have a gigantic 100 foot
fucking TV screen?

2771
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:46,010
That's not a billboard asshole.
If you want to have a billboard,

2772
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:48,080
have a billboard,
that's a movie theater.

2773
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,150
You're,
you get a movie screen up there,

2774
02:03:50,690 --> 02:03:54,200
the fuck it should be so illegal.
Well they let it be legal.

2775
02:03:54,230 --> 02:03:56,440
It's there.
So as we're driving we're,

2776
02:03:56,441 --> 02:03:59,990
we're watching shit.
And what do they do is it's still images

2777
02:04:00,050 --> 02:04:02,630
that they keep changing.
It's moving images cause he's like

2778
02:04:02,631 --> 02:04:04,040
you'll,
you'll see like crystal leave like

2779
02:04:04,041 --> 02:04:07,340
undateable this Thursday and they're not
moving around like throwing things and

2780
02:04:07,341 --> 02:04:08,930
stuff.
Like it's completely just commercial.

2781
02:04:08,931 --> 02:04:09,540
Sure.
Yeah,

2782
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:09,941
sure,
sure.

2783
02:04:09,941 --> 02:04:10,560
Definitely.
Sure.

2784
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:11,810
Yeah.
You guys can see it everyday.

2785
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:15,620
It's caught.
Even if it's still when still images or

2786
02:04:15,621 --> 02:04:18,350
moving like changing them every couple
seconds or soil.

2787
02:04:18,351 --> 02:04:20,840
Like what are you doing?
Why are you distracting people?

2788
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:23,780
I think they've made it illegal in a lot
of cases.

2789
02:04:23,781 --> 02:04:25,630
I think.
I think that for some,

2790
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:29,120
some reason has like a get out of free
jail card or something.

2791
02:04:29,330 --> 02:04:34,330
Get out of free jail.
Like Times Square Times Square has got

2792
02:04:35,031 --> 02:04:37,010
that passed to like,
it's almost like part,

2793
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:38,280
the charm of the place

2794
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:39,690
that you go there.
You're just going to be,

2795
02:04:39,691 --> 02:04:41,070
wow,
look at all the lights.

2796
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:43,740
This is crazy.
But the idea at times square as you

2797
02:04:43,741 --> 02:04:46,650
getting out of a cab,
are you climbing off the subway and you

2798
02:04:46,651 --> 02:04:49,290
look at around you?
You're not driving in that fucking

2799
02:04:49,291 --> 02:04:50,910
thing.
How many people go visit New York and

2800
02:04:50,911 --> 02:04:52,280
drive in Times Square?
I go,

2801
02:04:52,330 --> 02:04:54,700
Jesus Christ.
It's a,

2802
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:58,410
that's a giant ball of neon.
It's chaos.

2803
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:01,590
Like Vegas is the same way he received
some of those casinos.

2804
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:06,980
They've got damn a huge movie screens
play on the outside of their casino

2805
02:05:07,051 --> 02:05:11,850
showing you people sang in fucking
rocking out carrot top and pass all this

2806
02:05:11,851 --> 02:05:14,700
shit's going on.
As you're driving down the street and

2807
02:05:14,701 --> 02:05:17,640
you're on coke and you try and drive
slow,

2808
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:23,040
try to keep it together.
What's his fucking movie?

2809
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:26,040
Why they show me that Cirque du Solei?
You know,

2810
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:28,470
that's,
that's something that's pretty fucking

2811
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,423
specific.

2812
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:32,970
Think about that.
That show I'll give you go to Cirque de

2813
02:05:32,970 --> 02:05:35,610
Solei.
You need to see like almost superhuman

2814
02:05:35,611 --> 02:05:40,200
feats of physical fitness.
Like they had one of those Cirque de

2815
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:42,840
Solei dudes.
This is like a perfect contrast to what

2816
02:05:42,841 --> 02:05:44,610
we were doing.
We were,

2817
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:48,420
we were eating over it.
I guess it's like Wolfgang Puck's is

2818
02:05:48,421 --> 02:05:53,421
right over by the circus Solei place we
were eating and this dude was a coming

2819
02:05:53,701 --> 02:05:58,440
from the Cirque de Solei like he had
been working there and in the middle of

2820
02:05:58,441 --> 02:06:00,480
the hallway while we were stuffing our
face with food,

2821
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:03,840
this dude just starts doing back flips.
He did like one,

2822
02:06:03,841 --> 02:06:04,770
two,
three,

2823
02:06:04,771 --> 02:06:07,800
four,
five back lifts and Landon and laughed

2824
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:11,520
and laughed with his friend and fucking
button up shirt and get out of there.

2825
02:06:11,521 --> 02:06:14,880
But like this dude like just flip
through the air and then it started

2826
02:06:14,881 --> 02:06:16,140
going feet,
the hands,

2827
02:06:16,141 --> 02:06:16,861
feet,
the hands,

2828
02:06:16,861 --> 02:06:19,590
feet,
the hands jump and we were like,

2829
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:20,510
Whoa,
whoa.

2830
02:06:20,540 --> 02:06:22,770
We got a mouthful of linguine with
clams,

2831
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:27,510
trying to put a fucking damper on this
buzz before I go to sleep.

2832
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:32,780
You know this dude is flipping,
doing flips down the hallway.

2833
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:34,980
It,
what does that park core?

2834
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:36,410
Yeah,
this guy's a there.

2835
02:06:36,411 --> 02:06:37,890
There was,
I saw a video the other day.

2836
02:06:37,891 --> 02:06:41,250
This guy is just like on top of this
building and just jumps down through

2837
02:06:41,251 --> 02:06:44,700
this thing like go and jumps in through
a window.

2838
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:47,430
It's amazing what those guys do.
Like that's,

2839
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:51,060
that's craziness.
I'm becoming a grumpy old man cause this

2840
02:06:51,061 --> 02:06:51,894
uh,
this,

2841
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:58,100
this lady was like,
her son broke his arm doing par corp and

2842
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:00,691
I wrote,
Oh,

2843
02:07:00,691 --> 02:07:03,060
is that what they're calling it these
days?

2844
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:05,940
It was when I was a kid that was called
being an asshole.

2845
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:08,870
That's what I wanted to say.
I didn't say that.

2846
02:07:08,871 --> 02:07:10,620
Well why was he okay?
That's what I said.

2847
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:11,101
Yeah.
I said,

2848
02:07:11,101 --> 02:07:12,960
why was he okay?
But like why is it,

2849
02:07:13,190 --> 02:07:13,770
why,
why?

2850
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:17,130
How come it has to have a French name?
How come it has to be international?

2851
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:19,170
What you're doing is you're crazy
fucker.

2852
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:22,290
You're running and g doing flips off of
a railings.

2853
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,190
Shit.
All right.

2854
02:07:23,191 --> 02:07:24,480
Be careful.
This kid,

2855
02:07:24,481 --> 02:07:26,580
I know that for his birthday he does
that.

2856
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:29,810
That's what kids do nowadays.
They rent out rooms that just looked

2857
02:07:29,811 --> 02:07:34,811
like I pass by this place and right.
Actually the place I was going there was

2858
02:07:34,951 --> 02:07:36,550
a park core studio.
I was like,

2859
02:07:36,551 --> 02:07:39,820
what is this?
They're teaching people how to do this

2860
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:40,970
and apparently they're all right

2861
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:43,350
now it's super popular and they had
like,

2862
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:47,010
like ones that looked like super mario
brothers or like they have like,

2863
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:49,640
like uh,
yeah the,

2864
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:50,380
yeah,
this one.

2865
02:07:50,380 --> 02:07:53,580
Oh my God,
this one's in I in Los Angeles and it's

2866
02:07:53,581 --> 02:07:54,414
just like,

2867
02:07:54,660 --> 02:07:57,530
that's grown adults fucking jumping
around like kids,

2868
02:07:57,531 --> 02:08:00,940
man,
that's a cat to kids.

2869
02:08:00,941 --> 02:08:04,400
A little boy,
a little child is doing flips.

2870
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:05,990
Wow.
These kids are freaks.

2871
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:08,060
Wow.
That's pretty impressive though.

2872
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:10,460
Cause who's gonna pay for their acl
surgeries?

2873
02:08:10,970 --> 02:08:12,650
Exactly.
Damn.

2874
02:08:12,651 --> 02:08:14,620
That is really impressive.
That shit though.

2875
02:08:14,670 --> 02:08:17,480
The shit that kid is doing that flip off
the building,

2876
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:20,240
you know,
that is a really impressive stuff.

2877
02:08:20,241 --> 02:08:24,170
Come on man.
And they did just doing it to look cool

2878
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:26,170
I guess.
Right.

2879
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:29,190
Are there competitions,
I mean a little bit that American and

2880
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:31,210
this has really picked up and that's
kind of what these,

2881
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:34,040
that's the main competition.
I think these guys can go do what that

2882
02:08:34,041 --> 02:08:38,630
guy just did was exactly what that dude
the dude did in front back like back it

2883
02:08:38,631 --> 02:08:43,180
up like a little bit
like to the dude is doing no.

2884
02:08:43,190 --> 02:08:45,950
Before that,
the dude that was doing the flips right

2885
02:08:45,951 --> 02:08:46,730
there,
look at this.

2886
02:08:46,730 --> 02:08:48,710
That's what the guy was doing in the
hotel.

2887
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:51,560
Like no bullshit.
Hand Feed Tan.

2888
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:54,000
Have you ever even tried to do that?
Like,

2889
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:56,230
like on a diving board or water?
Yeah,

2890
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:57,980
I don't,
I've never even,

2891
02:08:57,981 --> 02:09:01,010
it's no consequences to back.
You gotta be careful.

2892
02:09:02,510 --> 02:09:07,340
I've heard my back and neck before too,
so I'm very wary about things that might

2893
02:09:07,341 --> 02:09:10,310
potentially be horrible for my fucking
spine.

2894
02:09:10,730 --> 02:09:12,170
Whoa.
These people are crazy.

2895
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:19,220
It seems so strange to watch people move
their bodies in ways you know you can't

2896
02:09:19,221 --> 02:09:21,260
move yours.
Like how,

2897
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:24,050
what?
How mine don't like if you saw yourself

2898
02:09:24,051 --> 02:09:24,651
doing that,
you're like,

2899
02:09:24,651 --> 02:09:28,400
how can I do this?
What do I have superhero powers now?

2900
02:09:28,770 --> 02:09:31,860
I find it more interesting watching
people doing any of these,

2901
02:09:31,950 --> 02:09:35,280
this kind of stuff in real life
situations like around the streets

2902
02:09:35,281 --> 02:09:39,360
because it's like they're ninjas.
They can like break into like buildings

2903
02:09:39,361 --> 02:09:40,980
just by doing this park horse shit

2904
02:09:41,090 --> 02:09:41,990
like no.
Right,

2905
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:43,550
like double jump.
I know.

2906
02:09:43,551 --> 02:09:46,910
It's weird.
It's weird.

2907
02:09:47,210 --> 02:09:48,890
They can do things with their bodies at
rego.

2908
02:09:48,891 --> 02:09:51,350
People just can't,
you just keep practicing.

2909
02:09:51,530 --> 02:09:53,480
But the,
these are all like cement things are

2910
02:09:53,481 --> 02:09:56,030
jumping around on are they,
what are these things made out of?

2911
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:58,120
Drywall?
Yeah.

2912
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:02,360
[inaudible] I don't know.
They're running around on dry wall like

2913
02:10:02,361 --> 02:10:04,760
that.
That Shit has to be super flimsy.

2914
02:10:05,660 --> 02:10:07,270
They would have to be more than drywall.
Floyd.

2915
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:09,770
It's probably like what they make a
skate ramps and stuff out of.

2916
02:10:09,830 --> 02:10:11,300
Yeah.
This is crazy.

2917
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:14,090
What it just keeps going.
Was that a girl or a guy with a long ass

2918
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:15,740
ponytail?
So the girl,

2919
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:16,610
yeah.
Whoa.

2920
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:17,990
She's doing flips and shit.

2921
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:23,490
The future of like UFC and shit.
It's like a room like this and that.

2922
02:10:23,491 --> 02:10:27,650
Both fighters just start on each side of
the room and they're allowed to like

2923
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:29,460
walk around.
And do you like nature moves?

2924
02:10:30,210 --> 02:10:32,480
That's actually a great idea.
Like her weight room?

2925
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:34,190
Yeah.
Like a quaker entering into a quick

2926
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:34,820
Rome.
Yeah.

2927
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:37,430
Wow.
Imagine if that would be,

2928
02:10:37,450 --> 02:10:40,400
um,
the more sophisticated high level

2929
02:10:40,401 --> 02:10:40,920
version of it

2930
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:44,610
and I may,
when we do it virtual reality style that

2931
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:47,850
two guys start out in a building and you
know,

2932
02:10:47,851 --> 02:10:51,660
they don't know where the other person
is in the building and so you have to

2933
02:10:51,661 --> 02:10:53,100
like be real sneaky

2934
02:10:53,210 --> 02:10:56,330
and walk around and you're allowed to
hit the person if they don't see you.

2935
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:58,250
Exactly.
It gets more realistic.

2936
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:00,140
It's more realistic.
Look at look at house,

2937
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:03,680
look back at boxing and you're like,
look how dumb it is.

2938
02:11:03,681 --> 02:11:05,600
They can't jump on the ground and they
can't do it.

2939
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,970
Now imagine doing this and be like look
how dumb that is.

2940
02:11:07,971 --> 02:11:10,070
We're going to like an octagon.
What the fuck?

2941
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:12,990
No hop up a building and this guy is
trying to rape you and,

2942
02:11:14,180 --> 02:11:16,630
and you're using shadows on walls and
like

2943
02:11:18,090 --> 02:11:21,630
I wonder if people would give up weight
classes if they were willing to use

2944
02:11:21,631 --> 02:11:24,030
weapons.
Like if the like a,

2945
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:27,180
okay look,
I'll take a a 50 pound weight

2946
02:11:27,181 --> 02:11:28,860
disadvantage,
but I want brass knuckles.

2947
02:11:29,910 --> 02:11:30,743
You know,

2948
02:11:32,490 --> 02:11:36,000
I'm remembering this TV show,
I really cannot remember the name of it,

2949
02:11:36,001 --> 02:11:37,770
but it's almost like that.
No,

2950
02:11:37,771 --> 02:11:41,580
it was like a real life really was fake,
but it was like real life mortal Kombat

2951
02:11:42,210 --> 02:11:45,540
and the shot around universal studios
and they'd go to different sets and it'd

2952
02:11:45,541 --> 02:11:48,900
be like an essential area.
Like this team versus team in the first

2953
02:11:48,901 --> 02:11:52,140
fight is going to be here and they'd go
like off to the lake and they'd go fight

2954
02:11:52,141 --> 02:11:55,680
at the lake and then come back
trying to look for it.

2955
02:11:55,681 --> 02:11:58,290
I have no idea what,
I totally forgot about that.

2956
02:11:58,530 --> 02:12:01,600
It's almost like you're saying,
but I mean that was the wrestling wwe

2957
02:12:01,770 --> 02:12:02,603
version of

2958
02:12:02,770 --> 02:12:05,380
wow,
that's right.

2959
02:12:05,790 --> 02:12:06,820
See,
there you go.

2960
02:12:06,821 --> 02:12:09,670
I'm a thief.
That's how easy it is to be a thief.

2961
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,150
That shit.
We were talking about something at a we

2962
02:12:13,330 --> 02:12:14,920
that's completely out of the ether.

2963
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:18,270
Yeah,
but I liked the idea of like what if,

2964
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:20,490
what if it was like the real world.
Every,

2965
02:12:20,491 --> 02:12:22,650
there's a camera in every room and you
know,

2966
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:26,280
one person's is started in the attic,
one person started in the basement and

2967
02:12:26,281 --> 02:12:28,010
you're trying to kill the other,
you know,

2968
02:12:28,030 --> 02:12:30,840
like beat up.
But I think there's gotta be an element

2969
02:12:30,841 --> 02:12:31,290
of virtual [inaudible]

2970
02:12:31,290 --> 02:12:33,240
reality like to,
for to watch it.

2971
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:34,350
Like,
cause we can't be there.

2972
02:12:34,351 --> 02:12:36,630
Right.
But to watch it and get the best angles,

2973
02:12:36,750 --> 02:12:39,870
you should be able to watch the
perspective of both people.

2974
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:41,880
Yeah.
The perspective of the guy doing the

2975
02:12:41,881 --> 02:12:44,190
beating up and their perspective.
The Guy Getting beat up,

2976
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:47,640
the perspective of the guy that doesn't
know the guys behind him and the

2977
02:12:47,641 --> 02:12:51,060
perspective of the guy who knows that
the guy doesn't know and he's sneaking

2978
02:12:51,061 --> 02:12:52,230
up on them,
ready to Jack Them.

2979
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:54,030
That would be wild,
man.

2980
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:58,410
Be Wild.
I see something like that and UFC mixed

2981
02:12:58,411 --> 02:12:59,610
with like a horror movie.
Well,

2982
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:03,270
imagine if you could like see the
punches coming your way and see yourself

2983
02:13:03,271 --> 02:13:06,570
getting knocked unconscious like poom.
Like how is he seeing it?

2984
02:13:06,630 --> 02:13:08,970
Like you see it,
you see the sparks that he sees in front

2985
02:13:08,971 --> 02:13:09,990
of his eyes.
You know,

2986
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:12,900
you're fucking consciousness dims in and
out just like he does.

2987
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:18,080
It might be a way that they could like
almost experience getting fucked up and

2988
02:13:19,021 --> 02:13:22,350
beat up to know how bad it is.
Whatever.

2989
02:13:22,351 --> 02:13:23,184
Reboot.
Yeah.

2990
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,200
How dare,
Ladies and gentlemen,

2991
02:13:25,201 --> 02:13:28,800
do not panic if you're just listening to
the audio version of this podcast.

2992
02:13:28,801 --> 02:13:32,070
Only you know what happened?
What happened is

2993
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:34,860
this God damn tri caster shit out again.

2994
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:37,450
Is that like a normal thing with the
[inaudible]?

2995
02:13:37,510 --> 02:13:39,650
It's happened a couple times,
but it hasn't happened for a long time.

2996
02:13:39,651 --> 02:13:44,480
It's just,
it's happened multiple times over our

2997
02:13:44,481 --> 02:13:47,300
pod and versions of it.
This was a complete pc for eas.

2998
02:13:47,330 --> 02:13:49,640
Otherwise,
other times it's been just a internet

2999
02:13:49,850 --> 02:13:50,600
disconnection.

3000
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:54,710
Do we have to make an upgrade?
Is there anything we need to do?

3001
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:55,753
Uh,
uh,

3002
02:13:55,970 --> 02:13:59,490
I don't know.
Should we upgrade our system the best

3003
02:13:59,491 --> 02:14:02,130
you can get you,
he really can't get any better than I

3004
02:14:02,131 --> 02:14:03,490
could try castor.
Seriously,

3005
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:06,230
man,
we can do it at the level that he's been

3006
02:14:06,231 --> 02:14:07,700
doing it right now with something like
that.

3007
02:14:07,730 --> 02:14:09,740
You don't want it to be more complicated
than that.

3008
02:14:09,741 --> 02:14:10,670
It's perfect.
Yeah.

3009
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:13,640
That thing's perfect.
It's just fucks up every now and then

3010
02:14:13,670 --> 02:14:15,440
and then it makes,
it gives us something to bitch about.

3011
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:17,780
Fucking truck.
[inaudible]

3012
02:14:19,730 --> 02:14:21,360
I don't know man.
Those things a,

3013
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:23,780
they're complicated as fuck.
They're going to shit out on you every

3014
02:14:23,781 --> 02:14:25,640
now and then.
I think it's just,

3015
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:27,460
you're,
we're streaming things and h d

3016
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:30,750
uh,
Mkbhd he stopped by here one time he's

3017
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:31,980
making,
he makes those cool uh,

3018
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:33,930
youtube videos sort of like unbox
therapy.

3019
02:14:33,931 --> 02:14:36,660
I think he's friends with them.
He made a cool video recently talking

3020
02:14:36,661 --> 02:14:40,980
about four k and the state of it now and
kind of like where we are.

3021
02:14:41,010 --> 02:14:43,800
And like you can watch four K on a TV
like that.

3022
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:45,870
Uh,
you can watch some of it on your phone,

3023
02:14:45,871 --> 02:14:49,470
but really you can only get it from like
Netflix and youtube and it's going to

3024
02:14:49,471 --> 02:14:52,710
take a long time before,
like it would take what happened for us

3025
02:14:52,711 --> 02:14:55,500
to get really good Internet here.
You have to dig up the ground but in

3026
02:14:55,501 --> 02:14:57,450
some new cables to get the bandwidth to
go.

3027
02:14:57,570 --> 02:14:59,340
Cause it's a lot of,
it's a lot of information you're trying

3028
02:14:59,341 --> 02:15:03,450
to send even were like fixed the math of
it.

3029
02:15:03,451 --> 02:15:05,860
That compression can easily be fixed by
like,

3030
02:15:05,910 --> 02:15:08,130
like a jpeg version of four,
four K,

3031
02:15:08,131 --> 02:15:09,790
you know,
like something that compresses fourcade

3032
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:13,200
down into something that you know,
but it would have the same image

3033
02:15:13,201 --> 02:15:13,890
quality.

3034
02:15:13,890 --> 02:15:16,950
Yeah.
I mean like look at bitmaps and jpegs.

3035
02:15:16,951 --> 02:15:19,560
He can't tell the difference between
those two but one with the naked eye.

3036
02:15:20,270 --> 02:15:23,210
But can you tell if you're looking at it
through a lens or anything like that?

3037
02:15:23,211 --> 02:15:26,190
Like the people that are really a t
mobile just got in trouble recently

3038
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:31,240
because uh,
because unlimited data or whatever for

3039
02:15:32,621 --> 02:15:34,370
that unlimited,
no,

3040
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:36,540
they,
what they do is they downgrade it to for

3041
02:15:36,541 --> 02:15:39,150
ADP.
So when you're on your phone watching

3042
02:15:39,151 --> 02:15:44,151
for 80 p you're not going to know the
fucking difference between 7:20 PM four

3043
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:48,400
eight
I wouldn't know for life,

3044
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:50,640
Bro.
For most people's phones through I was

3045
02:15:50,670 --> 02:15:53,790
real life bro.
Fucking sprint for the win.

3046
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:58,850
Fuck Verizon's tank for the wound 18 t
yes.

3047
02:15:59,310 --> 02:16:02,560
Who was it that gives you a Timo Fluke?
Do you know?

3048
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:06,450
[inaudible] my friends like four
eighties bullshit bro.

3049
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:07,680
Who Do you have right now?

3050
02:16:08,030 --> 02:16:12,230
This one is verizon.
Verizon and then the same phones for the

3051
02:16:12,231 --> 02:16:13,100
studio.
Yeah.

3052
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:14,510
I liked the,
um,

3053
02:16:14,870 --> 02:16:17,150
the new galaxy phones.
I think this is the,

3054
02:16:17,151 --> 02:16:21,020
the first series of galaxy phones or
they have features that are sort of

3055
02:16:21,021 --> 02:16:23,570
built in that make you go,
wow,

3056
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:27,110
I don't,
they all have charging a wireless

3057
02:16:27,111 --> 02:16:27,944
charging now.

3058
02:16:28,810 --> 02:16:29,740
Uh,
yeah.

3059
02:16:30,110 --> 02:16:30,941
Any of them do,
right?

3060
02:16:30,941 --> 02:16:31,601
Yes.
But you know,

3061
02:16:31,601 --> 02:16:35,440
what I've noticed with white,
with wireless charging is that it

3062
02:16:35,441 --> 02:16:40,441
charges slow and sometimes you'll put
your phone on the little dock thing and

3063
02:16:41,291 --> 02:16:43,570
it doesn't sit right.
Then you don't have a charge.

3064
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:44,920
And so then you're like,
what the fuck?

3065
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:47,500
I don't know.
It's still there right now.

3066
02:16:47,501 --> 02:16:49,240
There's a company,
I forget who it is,

3067
02:16:49,241 --> 02:16:54,241
I think it's apple that just filed a
patent for wireless charging for like,

3068
02:16:54,430 --> 02:16:55,660
like going to die.
Yeah.

3069
02:16:56,450 --> 02:16:58,390
We like to be able to breathe the air
and it's going to be filled with

3070
02:16:58,391 --> 02:17:01,160
electrical currents.
How's that possible about dude?

3071
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:04,530
250,
50 billion gallons of methane are being

3072
02:17:04,531 --> 02:17:05,970
pumped in the air.
Okay.

3073
02:17:05,971 --> 02:17:08,970
And that's floating.
How many pounds of Wifi we eating right

3074
02:17:08,971 --> 02:17:12,000
now while we're eating this podcast?
Maybe that's what's going on with

3075
02:17:12,001 --> 02:17:14,070
America.
We're so overweight because we're eating

3076
02:17:14,071 --> 02:17:14,904
wifi.

3077
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:18,330
No,
my new theory or eating Wifi and four g

3078
02:17:18,331 --> 02:17:21,090
lte,
the only thing it's doing is making more

3079
02:17:21,091 --> 02:17:24,360
autistic people.
We were okay with three g up to three g

3080
02:17:24,361 --> 02:17:26,490
and then we fell apart.
We're just eating too much.

3081
02:17:28,010 --> 02:17:28,843
It's weight

3082
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:33,640
and autism.
What do you think it gives people autism

3083
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:35,260
series?
Yeah.

3084
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:39,230
I think there's something to,
or autism is just on the rise at cry

3085
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:41,260
like so hot right now.
Like,

3086
02:17:41,261 --> 02:17:43,380
no,
no,

3087
02:17:43,381 --> 02:17:44,350
I mean,
but yeah,

3088
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:46,910
I think there's a bunch of different
causes that they think,

3089
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:48,800
uh,
I think they think genetics.

3090
02:17:49,010 --> 02:17:52,850
They think people when they get older
and have children much more likely,

3091
02:17:53,050 --> 02:17:55,310
uh,
that the children are going to have

3092
02:17:55,311 --> 02:17:58,640
autism becomes,
they become much more susceptible as the

3093
02:17:58,760 --> 02:18:02,360
parents get like older and older.
It's like directly proportionate they

3094
02:18:02,361 --> 02:18:04,250
think.
But there's a lot of questions.

3095
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:09,640
But what causes it or and whether or not
it's more prevalent today or whether the

3096
02:18:09,771 --> 02:18:12,770
diagnosing of it is more prevalent.
I believe that's,

3097
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:14,820
that's debatable.
Well,

3098
02:18:14,970 --> 02:18:17,990
you know when there's more people today,
so obviously there's going to be more

3099
02:18:17,991 --> 02:18:20,030
cases of it,
but are they the same percentage of

3100
02:18:20,031 --> 02:18:22,340
cases?
Like one of the things that they've

3101
02:18:22,341 --> 02:18:27,341
always tried to correlate is marijuana
with schizophrenia and the problems that

3102
02:18:27,711 --> 02:18:30,230
were exposed.
I think in the culture high they had

3103
02:18:30,231 --> 02:18:34,790
this where they were saying that the
instances of schizophrenia have been

3104
02:18:35,180 --> 02:18:37,720
uniform throughout history.
When we,

3105
02:18:37,730 --> 02:18:40,220
we monitoring it,
it's like 1% of the population,

3106
02:18:40,550 --> 02:18:45,140
100% of the population skids phrenic.
Like just because that 1% may or may not

3107
02:18:45,141 --> 02:18:46,110
have smoked marijuana,
it's,

3108
02:18:46,111 --> 02:18:48,800
it doesn't raise it.
When marijuana becomes more popular.

3109
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:52,220
When it gets used more,
it's still stays at 1% it doesn't seem

3110
02:18:52,221 --> 02:18:55,820
to vary from one person.
It's just 1% deviation.

3111
02:18:55,821 --> 02:18:59,690
It's like the quality control of God is
not the best in the world.

3112
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:01,511
Yeah,
I don't think it's weird.

3113
02:19:01,511 --> 02:19:03,690
I think it's mushrooms is an acid and
psychedelics,

3114
02:19:03,691 --> 02:19:05,830
I would actually speed ups,
that kind of stuff.

3115
02:19:05,930 --> 02:19:06,551
I,
I mean,

3116
02:19:06,551 --> 02:19:06,960
I,
I,

3117
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:11,960
I know so many people that have tripped
it never came back and you have mental

3118
02:19:13,140 --> 02:19:15,940
health issues.
Anything is not good for you.

3119
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:17,590
Alcohol,
certainly not good for you.

3120
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:19,300
Mental health issues.
You,

3121
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:21,730
you're,
you have a hard enough time just

3122
02:19:21,731 --> 02:19:24,520
remaining,
stay stable when you're sober,

3123
02:19:24,850 --> 02:19:28,400
if you're one of those bad,
some of them unfortunately,

3124
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:30,230
unfortunately.
Hi is that,

3125
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:33,080
you know,
Tony Tony's era from Columbus number

3126
02:19:33,081 --> 02:19:38,081
Tony Krantz a turtle turtle had always
the best fucking explanation for that.

3127
02:19:39,380 --> 02:19:40,520
He,
he like,

3128
02:19:40,521 --> 02:19:43,970
he made some play of words with
psychotic and neurotic and Louise always

3129
02:19:43,971 --> 02:19:45,290
talk about it,
but it's so true.

3130
02:19:45,291 --> 02:19:47,930
Like it's,
it's the common theme that everybody

3131
02:19:47,931 --> 02:19:50,450
always says,
like the crazy girls are the best in

3132
02:19:50,451 --> 02:19:51,710
bed.
True.

3133
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,810
And probably girls think crazy guys are
the best in bed,

3134
02:19:53,811 --> 02:19:57,980
which is why dirty dancing was so
appealing to young ladies in the 1980s.

3135
02:19:58,250 --> 02:19:59,900
Patrick swayze,
smooth,

3136
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:03,380
hairless chess,
sleek body moves like a dancer,

3137
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:06,070
flies across the room.
Uh,

3138
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:08,570
is that I had at the time of my life.
Is that the one?

3139
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,050
Well listen bitch,
you're only 18.

3140
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:18,170
Okay.
There's plenty of years coming.

3141
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:21,470
Don't get so crazy about nostalgia.
Oh my God.

3142
02:20:21,471 --> 02:20:24,290
The good old days when I was 18,
the fuck is wrong with you.

3143
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:25,970
How about you keep running it?
Don't,

3144
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,240
don't get us to sign of a bitch.
How

3145
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:36,440
have you ever had a clip that I like
something pops out of it.

3146
02:20:36,470 --> 02:20:38,120
Like it like almost like a,
like a tongue.

3147
02:20:38,150 --> 02:20:40,970
Like a cow tongue comes out clitoris.
Yeah.

3148
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:43,400
Like that.
But it pops up randomly in the middle of

3149
02:20:43,401 --> 02:20:46,970
talking about dirty dancing.
We were supposed to know what the fuck

3150
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:51,020
you just said like a pussy boner.
But like when it actually comes out like

3151
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:53,210
sticks out and goes in.
It's called a deck.

3152
02:20:53,211 --> 02:20:54,080
Brian,
fuck,

3153
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:57,110
you're fucking a guy.
Fucking a guy again.

3154
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:59,030
Is it a bodybuilder?
No.

3155
02:20:59,090 --> 02:21:01,400
No.
That does happen with bodybuilders.

3156
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:03,050
Yeah,
with female bodybuilders.

3157
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:05,600
If they take steroids,
but it was like a girl.

3158
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:08,090
It was like a boner that was in the
pussy.

3159
02:21:08,091 --> 02:21:10,040
They just came out.
I've never seen it before.

3160
02:21:10,041 --> 02:21:13,520
He would freaked me out.
There's some crazy fucking videos like

3161
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:15,530
you're well,
you're grabbing it like it's a fucking

3162
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:16,910
giraffe.
No,

3163
02:21:17,070 --> 02:21:20,450
the hand,
the hand gestures you're making are not

3164
02:21:20,510 --> 02:21:23,450
polite.
Not like dainty did a penis.

3165
02:21:23,451 --> 02:21:27,890
It was a tiny nothing to be offended by.
It was nothing that's going to scare

3166
02:21:27,891 --> 02:21:29,930
children.
It's nothing's going to hurt anybody's

3167
02:21:29,931 --> 02:21:31,520
feelings.
Just a little tiny penis.

3168
02:21:31,521 --> 02:21:34,070
It's inside a woman's vagina.
I don't know why it's there.

3169
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:36,920
Maybe fuck the hermaphrodite.
Is that how it works?

3170
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:38,780
No.
I was eating it and it just started

3171
02:21:38,781 --> 02:21:40,300
hitting me in the chin.
Okay,

3172
02:21:40,310 --> 02:21:42,480
you're still going to duck.
You're sucking Dick and you're on a

3173
02:21:42,481 --> 02:21:44,300
Mescalin.
You okay?

3174
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:45,800
Volumes.
You were talking about volumes.

3175
02:21:45,801 --> 02:21:46,970
I get it.
Do it.

3176
02:21:46,971 --> 02:21:51,320
Somebody drugged you and major bomb like
you was fucking noise Dick and said my

3177
02:21:51,321 --> 02:21:53,330
posts you wrote and you're like,
Yo,

3178
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:54,490
pussy so hot.

3179
02:21:57,660 --> 02:22:01,400
You don't know why you're gagging.
I'm just eating pussy to it feels like

3180
02:22:01,401 --> 02:22:06,050
I'm talking to day
about pussy smell and that dude's,

3181
02:22:06,051 --> 02:22:07,610
but you're like,
that is a lot of girls,

3182
02:22:07,611 --> 02:22:12,611
but there's no way
that big dick inside of that pussy todd.

3183
02:22:15,170 --> 02:22:17,480
Meanwhile you wake up all clay looted
out.

3184
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:19,860
What the fuck happened?
Who?

3185
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:22,460
Who dosed me?
I just never saw it that violent before.

3186
02:22:22,461 --> 02:22:26,010
Like it actually come down to getting
just choked.

3187
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:31,490
It looked like a fat fucking look like,
like a small boxers arm,

3188
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:38,670
like 135 pound champion arm.
You know,

3189
02:22:38,671 --> 02:22:40,200
like a fucking one of them Mexican
dudes.

3190
02:22:40,201 --> 02:22:45,201
It throws a nasty left hook to the body
like a Salvador Sanchez arm roping.

3191
02:22:46,770 --> 02:22:49,530
Fucking send you in.
It's just slamming in the back of your

3192
02:22:49,531 --> 02:22:50,364
throat.

3193
02:22:53,370 --> 02:22:54,960
Fucking quileutes.
Okay,

3194
02:22:54,961 --> 02:22:59,961
so an asterix and asteroids coming and
you have 10 minutes to do the run out in

3195
02:23:03,061 --> 02:23:07,350
the street and you do what?
Just fuck everyone else in the street

3196
02:23:07,351 --> 02:23:10,350
taking off their clothes.
I don't think anybody's getting it up

3197
02:23:10,351 --> 02:23:11,910
and it's going to be the saddest thing
in the world.

3198
02:23:11,911 --> 02:23:14,310
Did they hit in the head by a rock and
you're too nervous to get it up.

3199
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:18,640
The why.
Why is it you're ready to Bang your

3200
02:23:18,641 --> 02:23:22,660
sister?
Finally we get to see each other for 35

3201
02:23:22,661 --> 02:23:24,040
years.
It's fucking do this.

3202
02:23:24,041 --> 02:23:25,180
She's like,
fuck yeah,

3203
02:23:25,330 --> 02:23:28,780
I was wanting to fuck my brother.
You know he spits on his dick and he's

3204
02:23:28,781 --> 02:23:30,320
trying to get it hard in that fucking
thank,

3205
02:23:30,321 --> 02:23:33,130
he's getting closer and closer and she's
like,

3206
02:23:33,131 --> 02:23:34,780
come on,

3207
02:23:34,781 --> 02:23:37,090
we're going to die.
You're such a fucking loser.

3208
02:23:37,091 --> 02:23:38,620
I always knew you were a loser.

3209
02:23:38,620 --> 02:23:42,500
I give you a chance to fuck me.
Right is common and you fucking blew it.

3210
02:23:42,501 --> 02:23:45,890
Charlie Brown,

3211
02:23:46,870 --> 02:23:50,630

in connects with hyperspace as him not

3213
02:23:56,391 --> 02:24:00,620
being able to get it up while sister
screamed at him in the street staring at

3214
02:24:00,621 --> 02:24:02,120
an asteroid.
It makes me wonder though,

3215
02:24:02,121 --> 02:24:04,280
because I feel like there was going to
be a large amount of people.

3216
02:24:04,281 --> 02:24:05,840
If that happens,
that will run into the street.

3217
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:06,683
Be like,
that's it.

3218
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:09,210
Fuck people that no one wants to fuck.
They're like,

3219
02:24:12,250 --> 02:24:14,140
no,
they're going to run past you and

3220
02:24:14,141 --> 02:24:18,970
they're going to bang that hot MILF,
that fucking Moser Alon in high heels,

3221
02:24:18,971 --> 02:24:19,804
heels,
shoes,

3222
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:21,760
every,
every fucking street has that.

3223
02:24:21,761 --> 02:24:24,100
One crazy lady does is puts out the
scent,

3224
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:28,090
puts that heat sent out in the air.

3225
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:32,520
It is probably going to be mass rapes
and that's all it is.

3226
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:35,170
Like people just busting down doors
trying to that girl.

3227
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:36,790
Ooh,
that's what I'm talking about.

3228
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:38,650
That's what I'm saying.
Go for it from Friday.

3229
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:39,850

3236
02:24:57,140 --> 02:25:00,730

Katelyn have a kid together and it's

3237
02:25:00,731 --> 02:25:03,040
called the asteroid.
I don't mean in a race rectify this

3238
02:25:03,041 --> 02:25:08,041
young lady,
but that is a very strong part of her

3239
02:25:08,771 --> 02:25:10,390
anatomy.
Very strong.

3240
02:25:10,660 --> 02:25:13,330
I'm needed.
Objectifier but congratulations on

3241
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:16,630
hitting the genetic lottery.
Like the height of that ass.

3242
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:20,520
You go hot,
you know in that position it should like

3243
02:25:20,530 --> 02:25:22,680
retain like a little flatness.
The thing must be,

3244
02:25:22,681 --> 02:25:27,681
look when she stands straight up,
let's see it now it's here now.

3245
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:28,501
No,
no,

3246
02:25:28,501 --> 02:25:30,820
don't do,
don't blow this whole thing.

3247
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:33,820
But shadow don't be so mean about the
universe and time.

3248
02:25:34,570 --> 02:25:35,920
Is there a photo of her?
Her,

3249
02:25:36,010 --> 02:25:40,540
but just standing there.
Is that right above her?

3250
02:25:40,541 --> 02:25:41,750
Right above is it?
No.

3251
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:44,830
Does that her down there to watering
right there.

3252
02:25:44,950 --> 02:25:45,940
Oh good Lord.

3253
02:25:49,180 --> 02:25:51,970
What is it about hip to waist ratio?
You know?

3254
02:25:53,170 --> 02:25:55,480
Oh my goodness.
What a good kid.

3255
02:25:58,360 --> 02:26:03,360
The genetic mother fucking lottery.
That's why it must fucking suck.

3256
02:26:06,670 --> 02:26:10,480
It must fucking suck.
If you wished you looked like that and

3257
02:26:10,481 --> 02:26:13,280
you didn't just looking at her go.
I said,

3258
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:16,750
especially if you're a guy like save
your guy and you,

3259
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:19,930
you feel like you identify being a
woman,

3260
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:23,290
but you really want to look like that.
But meanwhile you look like Ralphie May.

3261
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:27,850
Well you look like Joey Diaz.
I think I'd be as sexy as fuck woman.

3262
02:26:27,851 --> 02:26:30,320
I think if I've never dressed up,
I think I've beat,

3263
02:26:30,470 --> 02:26:33,300
I'm just clicking right now.
That's not true.

3264
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:37,300
You definitely have womanly hips.
You would look like you already shut

3265
02:26:37,301 --> 02:26:38,140
out.
All your kids though.

3266
02:26:39,370 --> 02:26:41,380
Did we should dress up as a woman.
One episode.

3267
02:26:42,580 --> 02:26:46,600
She used to be a barker,
but apparently to back in the back of it

3268
02:26:46,601 --> 02:26:49,840
then we should see who could it be was a
playboy.

3269
02:26:50,650 --> 02:26:51,441
What's that?
Right there.

3270
02:26:51,441 --> 02:26:54,700
It wasn't say playboy.
She's got naked pictures.

3271
02:26:55,300 --> 02:26:57,100
Good for her.
Good for her.

3272
02:26:57,220 --> 02:27:00,550
You know?
That's another thing I think is not

3273
02:27:00,551 --> 02:27:03,880
nothing wrong with playboy folks.
Nothing wrong with naked bodies,

3274
02:27:05,230 --> 02:27:06,880
but there's nothing wrong with porn
either,

3275
02:27:07,450 --> 02:27:09,100
but we're not there yet.
Right.

3276
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:13,150
Getting close.
People are getting closer for sure,

3277
02:27:13,870 --> 02:27:16,870
but more acceptable nowadays.
The kids know what it is nowadays.

3278
02:27:16,871 --> 02:27:19,150
I didn't know that.
They always stay all this crap.

3279
02:27:19,151 --> 02:27:21,100
Yeah.
Anyone can just look at porn.

3280
02:27:21,390 --> 02:27:23,320
Do you think that vr stuff could save
porn?

3281
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:26,300
Where does it go?
I mean that's like,

3282
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:28,630
do you think that better cooking can
save food?

3283
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:31,150
They won't give it away for free.
So like you have to buy it,

3284
02:27:31,350 --> 02:27:32,530
they will give it away for free.
They don't.

3285
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:33,730
Yeah,
but see dude,

3286
02:27:33,731 --> 02:27:36,790
this,
I think in a lot of ways what's going to

3287
02:27:36,791 --> 02:27:41,350
happen with some of the artists that
kind of use the most respectful term

3288
02:27:41,351 --> 02:27:44,050
possible is a,
they can make personal appearances,

3289
02:27:44,090 --> 02:27:45,460
they can make a ton of money doing that.

3290
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:49,330
Like sort of like a,
like almost like musicians that don't

3291
02:27:49,331 --> 02:27:53,800
sell too many cds now.
Like it's hard other than apple maybe to

3292
02:27:53,810 --> 02:27:55,960
apple should get in the porn business,
say fuck it,

3293
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:58,120
stop being pussies about it.
Just get in,

3294
02:27:58,190 --> 02:28:01,180
sit down.
And if apple just decides to go whole

3295
02:28:01,181 --> 02:28:03,640
hog and has an adult APP,
okay.

3296
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:05,980
And you opened up their adult app,
it comes in the opera,

3297
02:28:05,981 --> 02:28:09,490
it just called adult and you enter in
all your information that shows that

3298
02:28:09,491 --> 02:28:11,200
you're a certain age and you,
you know,

3299
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:13,480
he'd do the thumbprint thing.
You have to do the thumb printing to

3300
02:28:13,481 --> 02:28:16,960
activate so they know it's you and not
someone using your phone that knows your

3301
02:28:16,961 --> 02:28:20,650
code that isn't of age.
And then you watch as much fucking porn

3302
02:28:20,651 --> 02:28:21,484
as you want

3303
02:28:22,380 --> 02:28:23,210
it.
They shouldn't.

3304
02:28:23,210 --> 02:28:25,700
They should do it.
I know they're stupid not to do it.

3305
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:28,160
You could buy it then the actors can get
paid.

3306
02:28:28,610 --> 02:28:30,410
Exactly.
Notice I said actors,

3307
02:28:30,411 --> 02:28:31,730
actors,
models,

3308
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:33,590
Lucky's,
everything that bill hicks bail about

3309
02:28:33,591 --> 02:28:37,310
models like here's,
here's Debbie modeling a 12 inch Dick in

3310
02:28:37,311 --> 02:28:38,144
her mouth.
I'm like,

3311
02:28:40,740 --> 02:28:42,410
I did it.
No justice.

3312
02:28:42,470 --> 02:28:43,430
I'm trying to remember.
It was,

3313
02:28:43,431 --> 02:28:46,940
I'm saying it.
You know Bill Hicks is a is Alex Jones,

3314
02:28:46,941 --> 02:28:48,200
right?
That's what I heard.

3315
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:51,410
What does this,
your iphone can be hacked with a photo

3316
02:28:51,411 --> 02:28:52,730
of your thumb.
Chase us.

3317
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:55,130
Of course.
It could be your iphone could be hacked

3318
02:28:55,131 --> 02:28:56,690
by you're asleep.
Yeah.

3319
02:28:56,691 --> 02:28:59,150
The government,
the government is already reading your

3320
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:02,060
tweets.
I twitter messages.

3321
02:29:02,110 --> 02:29:03,650
I tried that though.
Like my,

3322
02:29:03,730 --> 02:29:06,790
I was dating a girl and I did the whole
thumb to see if it would work and it

3323
02:29:06,791 --> 02:29:07,624
did.
It did.

3324
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:11,740
I'll wash it asleep.
That's so rude.

3325
02:29:12,190 --> 02:29:13,560
So rude.
It's rude.

3326
02:29:13,570 --> 02:29:14,500
It's wet.
Esther does.

3327
02:29:14,501 --> 02:29:19,270
Little esther goes while it let her
boyfriend's in the bathroom and turns on

3328
02:29:19,271 --> 02:29:23,480
location shit where it so she could just
track all day long.

3329
02:29:24,250 --> 02:29:26,380
Weird.
That's an option in your phone that a

3330
02:29:26,381 --> 02:29:30,430
lot of people don't know is I can turn
on my location tracking and send it to

3331
02:29:30,431 --> 02:29:31,660
you so you can just track me for life.

3332
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:34,190
What is so weird,
the people you want to do that and they

3333
02:29:34,191 --> 02:29:35,500
want to like fall people.
What pill?

3334
02:29:35,510 --> 02:29:39,140
Fuck you up to Jamie.
How about people that would do that?

3335
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:41,960
Their employees.
It makes it employees stay within a

3336
02:29:41,961 --> 02:29:44,690
certain range.
I don't want you to going out on the

3337
02:29:44,691 --> 02:29:48,980
road this weekend and getting all tired.
I want you to be fresh for work Monday,

3338
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:52,130
but Mr. Wilson,
you can't tell me where to go on in the

3339
02:29:52,131 --> 02:29:53,690
world this weekend.
Well,

3340
02:29:53,691 --> 02:29:57,350
if you want a promotion,
you'll be the guy that stays in and get

3341
02:29:57,351 --> 02:30:00,410
some arrest.
Is that possible?

3342
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:03,770
I mean if,
if bosses can tell you that you can't

3343
02:30:03,771 --> 02:30:05,300
have that,
you have to have a piss test.

3344
02:30:05,301 --> 02:30:07,010
Okay.
If they could piss test you.

3345
02:30:07,310 --> 02:30:10,370
Well they're saying is they want to make
sure you didn't smoke some pot on the

3346
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:11,203
weekend.
Right?

3347
02:30:11,270 --> 02:30:12,230
Have you get there Monday?

3348
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:14,990
Like I know guys who won't smoke pot
because they worried they're going to

3349
02:30:14,991 --> 02:30:18,110
get tested randomly at work and it would
cost them their job.

3350
02:30:18,470 --> 02:30:20,320
You get fired,
so if you get,

3351
02:30:20,390 --> 02:30:23,030
you've smoked a joint on Friday after
work,

3352
02:30:23,140 --> 02:30:26,000
then you know the fights are on.
You get a pizza with your friends,

3353
02:30:26,001 --> 02:30:27,590
you guys smoke a joint,
you have a laugh,

3354
02:30:27,591 --> 02:30:30,110
you watch pizza and then you show up
Monday morning.

3355
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:33,140
Do you really think they're going to be
affected by that joint?

3356
02:30:33,141 --> 02:30:34,160
Nope.
Not at all.

3357
02:30:34,161 --> 02:30:38,060
But they'll test positive.
They're going to test positive.

3358
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:39,770
That's,
that's the same thing.

3359
02:30:40,220 --> 02:30:42,020
It's not,
it's just like your boss is telling you

3360
02:30:42,021 --> 02:30:45,410
mentally to stay put.
I mean that's the same thing.

3361
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:47,620
That's what they're doing.
I used to have to do that.

3362
02:30:47,621 --> 02:30:49,280
I remember I would smoke weed and I'm
like,

3363
02:30:49,281 --> 02:30:50,420
Goddamn,
I smoked weed.

3364
02:30:50,421 --> 02:30:53,060
Now I better not get tested in the next
couple of weeks.

3365
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:55,790
I would like freaking out looking at the
calendar like shit and they can have a

3366
02:30:55,791 --> 02:30:58,730
zero tolerance policy I think of write
it into their contract cause it's an

3367
02:30:58,731 --> 02:31:02,120
illegal drug and they just fire you man
and you,

3368
02:31:02,130 --> 02:31:04,070
you,
you could have totally non-psychoactive

3369
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:06,080
levels in your system.
Doesn't matter.

3370
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:09,230
Totally sober.
And also there's no science that backs

3371
02:31:09,231 --> 02:31:11,290
that.
There's long term effects of you know

3372
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:15,320
you smoke a joint on Friday night and
you know on Monday morning some sort of

3373
02:31:15,321 --> 02:31:19,740
a long term it does nothing and,
and by eight and if there is judge the

3374
02:31:19,741 --> 02:31:21,570
person based on their performance at
work,

3375
02:31:21,750 --> 02:31:22,690
don't you know,
you,

3376
02:31:22,691 --> 02:31:24,510
you can't,
if someone's not doing their job at

3377
02:31:24,511 --> 02:31:27,060
work,
I mean that's why they check each other

3378
02:31:27,061 --> 02:31:30,120
out and that's why they have assessments
and stuff and that's why you have

3379
02:31:30,121 --> 02:31:32,130
meetings with your supervisors.
That's what that's for.

3380
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:33,590
Okay.
It doesn't nothing to do with what,

3381
02:31:33,730 --> 02:31:38,100
like one person could be a fucking moron
and never touch a drop of alcohol and

3382
02:31:38,101 --> 02:31:40,410
never smoke and never do anything their
whole life.

3383
02:31:40,590 --> 02:31:43,230
And they can be a fucking moron.
You don't get Brownie points,

3384
02:31:43,231 --> 02:31:45,870
you'll get extra points for not doing
drugs.

3385
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:48,510
You just don't.
It's like what happens when the guy

3386
02:31:48,511 --> 02:31:49,470
does?
Is he okay?

3387
02:31:49,471 --> 02:31:51,720
What if he has a couple of drinks on
Friday and,

3388
02:31:51,721 --> 02:31:53,010
uh,
he shows up Monday morning,

3389
02:31:53,011 --> 02:31:55,770
fresh as a daisy.
He worked out at the gym at five 30 and

3390
02:31:55,771 --> 02:31:57,330
he's fucking here ready to rock and
roll.

3391
02:31:57,540 --> 02:31:58,950
What do you,
what do you give a fuck?

3392
02:31:59,490 --> 02:32:03,180
Like it's stupid.
It's a stupid like distinction to put on

3393
02:32:03,181 --> 02:32:06,300
someone to think that somehow or another
it's bad.

3394
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:07,353
Yeah.

3395
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:12,080
This weekend about Netflix,
they offer unlimited vacation time to

3396
02:32:12,081 --> 02:32:13,730
their work.
As long as they get their work done.

3397
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:15,320
So like,
and theoretically,

3398
02:32:15,321 --> 02:32:18,680
I guess you'd go get high and take two
weeks off and come back and be fuck

3399
02:32:18,681 --> 02:32:19,610
yeah.
Mean Netflix

3400
02:32:19,640 --> 02:32:21,190
killing it again.
Right.

3401
02:32:21,830 --> 02:32:23,480
I'm addicted to Narcos,
man.

3402
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:26,930
I'm like seven episodes in now.
I did the seventh one last night.

3403
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:29,240
Fuck,
that shows good.

3404
02:32:29,870 --> 02:32:31,070
God Damn.
It's good.

3405
02:32:32,630 --> 02:32:36,080
It's a fucking wellmade show.
It's like a movie every week,

3406
02:32:36,770 --> 02:32:38,220
you know?
And I like,

3407
02:32:38,260 --> 02:32:40,790
it's crazy that it's all based on a true
story.

3408
02:32:40,970 --> 02:32:45,970
Pablo Escobar was insane.
Like you got to watch this series folks,

3409
02:32:46,251 --> 02:32:49,880
you got to watch this series because
it's all based on real events and you

3410
02:32:49,881 --> 02:32:54,881
realize how unbelievably insane Escobar
was and the amount of power and money

3411
02:32:56,271 --> 02:32:58,010
that guy at.
It's incredible.

3412
02:32:58,011 --> 02:33:03,011
It's beyond imagination and they did
such a great job of building up the

3413
02:33:03,651 --> 02:33:07,940
production of showing like how they
started making it and selling it and

3414
02:33:07,941 --> 02:33:10,880
showing the impact of it and fuck.
It's good.

3415
02:33:11,570 --> 02:33:12,180
Fuck it.

3416
02:33:12,180 --> 02:33:13,950
Good.
Did you hear about the guy in Miami who

3417
02:33:13,951 --> 02:33:17,220
recently bought a house and when they
were excavating some of the property,

3418
02:33:17,221 --> 02:33:20,160
they found a safe and it was Pablo
Escobar's former house.

3419
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:23,580
Oh Shit.
The press and the first safe got stolen

3420
02:33:23,790 --> 02:33:26,100
and they found a second safe and they
told the press again.

3421
02:33:26,101 --> 02:33:28,750
I don't think it's not being kept
somewhere so they can,

3422
02:33:28,850 --> 02:33:30,990
I don't think they've opened it or found
out what's in it,

3423
02:33:30,991 --> 02:33:33,530
but as an asshole,
keep your mouth shut son.

3424
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:36,210
Don't you have friends?
Where do you get a friend?

3425
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:39,840
Pickup truck.
It's time to get rich.

3426
02:33:41,700 --> 02:33:44,820
I wonder if that money's flagged.
You know,

3427
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:47,010
probably if there's money in it,
it's gold.

3428
02:33:47,011 --> 02:33:48,300
Open up the safe.
And it's just,

3429
02:33:48,330 --> 02:33:50,190
who knows?
Mother saves heads.

3430
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:56,080
All people that Pablo Escobar hated safe
found within concrete of the late truck

3431
02:33:57,481 --> 02:33:58,590
king.
Wow.

3432
02:33:58,591 --> 02:34:01,170
That's amazing.
Fuck man.

3433
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:03,950
They said the management was believed to
just to be used the stash cash.

3434
02:34:04,190 --> 02:34:05,010
So

3435
02:34:05,010 --> 02:34:06,510
Dude,
you gotta watch this series.

3436
02:34:06,570 --> 02:34:09,300
It's incredible.
It's incredible when you realize how

3437
02:34:09,301 --> 02:34:13,710
much money that guy had and how much
power and how much havoc he caused.

3438
02:34:14,130 --> 02:34:17,230
And then it wasn't that long ago.
And now they say Columbia is like really

3439
02:34:17,231 --> 02:34:18,040
safe and really

3440
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,800
nice.
I Columbia is a totally different place

3441
02:34:20,801 --> 02:34:23,040
now.
Now that all that shit's done with it.

3442
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:23,771
They're like,
no,

3443
02:34:23,771 --> 02:34:25,060
it's nice.
Like they figured it out.

3444
02:34:25,061 --> 02:34:28,270
Like bourdain went there for a show and
you a,

3445
02:34:28,280 --> 02:34:29,710
you see what it's like now.
It's like,

3446
02:34:29,711 --> 02:34:32,890
it's really beautiful.
So they actually worked our way through

3447
02:34:32,891 --> 02:34:34,990
this issue.
It's crazy cause people think of

3448
02:34:34,991 --> 02:34:37,450
Columbia and you think of the,
the metagene cartel,

3449
02:34:37,451 --> 02:34:41,350
you think of the drug killings of him.
It's like one of the most iconic things

3450
02:34:41,351 --> 02:34:42,190
about it.
Right?

3451
02:34:42,430 --> 02:34:44,080
And then coffee.
Yeah.

3452
02:34:44,180 --> 02:34:47,110
Right.
Also saw the drones being used to carry

3453
02:34:47,111 --> 02:34:48,480
drugs over the border.
Yeah.

3454
02:34:48,481 --> 02:34:49,390
I said,
go this weekend.

3455
02:34:49,470 --> 02:34:52,810
And two prisons even there,
people are using drones to do things to

3456
02:34:52,811 --> 02:34:54,110
madness.
God dammit.

3457
02:34:54,150 --> 02:34:55,390
All right.
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

3458
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:59,350
It's four 17 right now.
Wednesday.

3459
02:34:59,351 --> 02:35:02,950
Brian Red Ban.
I believe there's a show we're doing a

3460
02:35:02,951 --> 02:35:06,310
death squad secret show at the U and R
are a shift far.

3461
02:35:06,430 --> 02:35:08,680
How's it a secret if you're telling
everybody,

3462
02:35:08,681 --> 02:35:11,940
because there's a secret cast,
but I'm not going to tell you about,

3463
02:35:12,020 --> 02:35:13,660
oh,
you're so tricky.

3464
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:15,430
But John Heffron,
Rory Scovel,

3465
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:16,800
Dean del Rey.
Nice.

3466
02:35:17,030 --> 02:35:19,510
Okay.
And that starts at eight 30 comedy

3467
02:35:19,511 --> 02:35:22,690
store.
Main rooms were full and a,

3468
02:35:22,691 --> 02:35:26,860
I'm doing don my rare show today at the
laugh factory at eight.

3469
02:35:27,370 --> 02:35:28,370
And then,
um,

3470
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:33,070
the Dean Delray Show after that,
the 50th birthday show that's at the El

3471
02:35:33,070 --> 02:35:36,010
Rey theater.
And that's Brian Red band.

3472
02:35:36,040 --> 02:35:36,671
Chris,
who else?

3473
02:35:36,671 --> 02:35:38,620
Who else is with Chris Delea?
Berge,

3474
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:39,810
Joe,
Joe Barton,

3475
02:35:39,811 --> 02:35:40,644
Nick,
uh,

3476
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:42,190
Bill Burr,
Kristala and me.

3477
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:43,720
We're going to have some fun.
And Dean del Rey,

3478
02:35:43,721 --> 02:35:45,010
of course,
who's turning 50.

3479
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:47,260
All right.
You fucking animals.

3480
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:49,330
Thank you very much.
Appreciate the hell out of you people.

3481
02:35:49,390 --> 02:35:51,110
The hell,
hell um,

3482
02:35:51,570 --> 02:35:53,620
the heck about that.
I want to say fuck,

3483
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:55,340
but I want to say fuck twice in a row.
That accurate.

3484
02:35:55,350 --> 02:35:57,510
It sounds ignorant.
Goodnight.

3485
02:35:57,530 --> 02:35:59,410
Goodbye.
Much love big kids.
