1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,611
Have you bravo.

3
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:03,151
What's happening?

4
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:03,691
Cock sucker.

5
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:04,090
What's up?

6
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,550
You're a month away from having a kid.

7
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:07,920
You sitting there like fucking
Buddha with no fucking food.

8
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,053
Talk to me.

9
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,250
I love ready for this man.

10
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,941
Are you ready?

11
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:13,220
This you gotta be fucking ready.

12
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,100
Oh Tommy Shit.

13
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:14,491
Hell yeah.

14
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:15,324
You gotta be ready.

15
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,200
Have you picked a name yet?

16
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,780
You looked at t a TV show on discovery.

17
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,140
I want you to tell me you went the uncle's
house and change some diapers and a

18
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,300
habit for awhile.

19
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,470
And we tried that.

20
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,791
This was planned.

21
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,230
This was not an accident.

22
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,920
I wanted a kid.

23
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,833
I want her to kid.

24
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,360
You know,

25
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:30,891
I'm proud of you.

26
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:33,980
I'm happy if it's going to
be a fascinating experience.

27
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:34,814
Man

28
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,993
were different.

29
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,260
Fucking men for sure
changed me as a human being.

30
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,140
First it was the refund when you came
to me and you said you had the best ice

31
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,100
cream Sundae in your life.

32
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,860
Whenever you bravo the
way you gave it to me.

33
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:46,671
That was beautiful.

34
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,630
And then next thing you know,

35
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,860
Mrs Rogan came on the scene.

36
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:52,280
I seem to hold up that I will never
forget the day Eddie Bravo got me high.

37
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,540
We that we went and had ice cream Sundae
and I had the most massive revelation

38
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,290
in my life.

39
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,330
I couldn't believe how God damn good.

40
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:00,670
That ice cream Sundae a bit.

41
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,040
Your menu was the first time we ever
straightened up before then you were

42
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:04,874
fucking ape.

43
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,120
You were still bent over.

44
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,110
If I drew you a banana,

45
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:09,280
you need to fucking pill.

46
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,383
Seriously.

47
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,151
Dairy Queen,

48
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:13,984
you were back.

49
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,910
You were back.

50
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,360
Your chest is up his shit.

51
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:17,320
Well you guys know me.

52
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:18,940
I don't know me as well as you guys know.

53
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,450
Please.

54
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,283
That was it.

55
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,250
You were walking on all snow until
that fucking drama from person.

56
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,630
I'm a lot more relaxed and everything,

57
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,220
but it must've been interesting.

58
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,280
Much more for you to watch
someone changed their first.

59
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,590
So fucking beautiful vain man.

60
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,820
I love to see evolution.

61
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,211
I,

62
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:34,110
but people watch it.

63
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,600
I love to watch people
shut your fucking mouth.

64
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,340
Don't say to him,

65
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,410
let him walk into that hole.

66
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,520
You know?

67
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,181
Don't say that,

68
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,380
but think coming from,

69
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,010
you know,

70
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,940
my background,

71
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,271
you know,

72
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,720
but like doing martial arts competitions
my whole life and then just transition

73
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,560
right into comedy.

74
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,270
I had never relaxed.

75
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,230
I never settled down.

76
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,651
I never,

77
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:54,810
I never learned how to just be calm,

78
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,600
you know?

79
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,320
It was my whole body and my brain,

80
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:59,160
my personality,

81
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,320
all developed under duress.

82
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,090
It all developed under a physical
combat all the time on a regular basis.

83
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,050
Constant training,

84
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,190
constant fights,

85
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,190
constant tournament's that was,

86
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:09,390
no,

87
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,260
that was my life from like the time I
was 15 till I was 22 all my formative

88
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,740
years was all spent in,

89
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,690
in stress.

90
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,510
And I remember when I first decided
that I wasn't going to fight anymore.

91
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:21,810
I was like the first time ever in my
life when I was like 22 it's my last

92
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:22,650
kickboxing fights.

93
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,440
The first time ever where I could relax,

94
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,910
I would always like be nervous.

95
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,290
Like when is the next tournament?

96
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,160
When's the next fight?

97
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:30,780
When's the next thing
I got to get in shape?

98
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:31,680
I can't be drinking this.

99
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,543
I can't be doing this.

100
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,490
Couldn't live my life because I was always
worried about getting my ass kicked.

101
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,540
I was always worrying about like,

102
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,280
I have to make sure that
I do everything right.

103
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,300
I had to be prepared.

104
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,350
I don't want to get fucked up,

105
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,771
you know?

106
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:41,340
So it's like,

107
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,150
it's,

108
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,720
it wasn't the best mindset to
go into stand up comedy for,

109
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:46,321
that's for sure.

110
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,360
It's like a constant battle
because standup comedy,

111
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,194
you got to,

112
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,220
it's totally the opposite.

113
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,360
You've got to not give a fuck.

114
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,691
You know,

115
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:52,290
you gotta,

116
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,220
you gotta be relaxed.

117
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:56,370
You've got to have fun instead of be
tense and ready to go at any moment's

118
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:56,761
notice.

119
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,180
You know,

120
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,130
you sent me a,

121
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,561
by the way,

122
00:02:58,561 --> 00:02:59,280
whatever you sent me,

123
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,950
it doesn't work.

124
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,761
One of them doesn't work.

125
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:01,594
The other two do.

126
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,543
Check her emails.

127
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,840
You sent me two things and both of them
are like movies that are one second long

128
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,500
what?

129
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,333
Yeah.

130
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,960
It's amazing how again,

131
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,181
dude,

132
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:13,580
I know it's,

133
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:13,841
I know.

134
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,200
It's good.

135
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,671
My father,

136
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:15,161
he send it.

137
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:15,700
Okay.

138
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,450
I fucking 15 to 22 my mind
wasn't fighting the Ma.

139
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:20,261
I was a fighter,

140
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,610
but I was in a different type of hell.

141
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,444
I was in my own hall.

142
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,560
I was putting myself into,

143
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,394
you know,

144
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,330
it was so weird.

145
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,200
I became a comic,

146
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:26,391
what,

147
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:26,651
six,

148
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:27,011
seven,

149
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:32,011
eight years later or something like that
and how I took that wildness into the

150
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:35,770
fucking comic and nobody understood what
I was saying until I met you guys at

151
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,604
the store.

152
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,140
I filed the fucking home.

153
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:38,651
I was always,

154
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,950
I used to travel on the road with
Dribbble and to all these little road.

155
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:42,120
Dot.

156
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,840
I remember when I first
met you at the store,

157
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,370
everybody was fucking terrified of you.

158
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,701
Yeah,

159
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,530
I was crazy and I was letting you,

160
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,600
you and I,

161
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,340
I remember being like the only guy,

162
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,170
like when I first met you that was like,

163
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:53,860
he's great.

164
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,521
What are you talking about?

165
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,354
I love that guy.

166
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,961
And he was like,

167
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:56,181
Oh,

168
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:57,050
here comes Joey Diaz.

169
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,220
Like,

170
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,030
where's he at?

171
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,300
I like what gravitate towards
you because you didn't scare me.

172
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:02,290
You were nice to me.

173
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,680
You were you,

174
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,900
you weren't a scary guy to me.

175
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,040
You were a regular dude.

176
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,100
I see.

177
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,430
You were like one of the only
guys there that I could relate to.

178
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,410
There was like a lot of guys
that I couldn't relate to.

179
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,730
I knew dudes like you,

180
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,241
you know,

181
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:13,421
I mean,

182
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:13,931
not you,

183
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,630
but you and my friend
Johnny be the Pool Hustler.

184
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,100
Very similar characters,

185
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:18,700
man.

186
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,061
Very,

187
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,140
very similar characters.

188
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,700
You're both way out there.

189
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,460
You both like not give a fuck guys.

190
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,320
And you're both guys that
were like polarizing.

191
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,260
Some people would love you
to death and then everybody,

192
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:29,531
you know,

193
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,171
there was a lot,

194
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,140
a large group of people
that for whatever reason,

195
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,040
they'd be upset at you.

196
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,311
Like,

197
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,810
I remember having to defend you,

198
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,890
even a dom Arrera,

199
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,131
even.

200
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:36,311
Dot.

201
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,040
Merera was hate nine year for everybody.

202
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,810
Every and I don't get,

203
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,551
and I loved it.

204
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,230
I fucking loved it because that's what I,

205
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:41,801
you know,

206
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:44,830
it's so weird that this whole surgery
thing really taught me about fear.

207
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,290
My fear has fucking done wonders for me
because that's why when I wake up in the

208
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:50,490
molest,

209
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,350
the first thing I stopped him
do is grab my fucking cock.

210
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,170
Because for years I was scared.

211
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:01,171
I'm always insecure that immigrant fucking
things shizzle into my fucking mind.

212
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,970
Since the streets in New
York City with the White Kid,

213
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,051
the immigrant thing,

214
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,160
not knowing the language,

215
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:07,690
not feeling good enough
like everybody else,

216
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:11,170
not being a fucking American and
it sits inside my fucking soul.

217
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,640
So for me,

218
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:14,290
everything has been ribbon on fear.

219
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,710
Every time I get on stage,

220
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:18,580
it's like the other night
fear was real in Chicago.

221
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,300
I got on stage in between the reefer and
whatever was going on and the lights.

222
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,440
I got fearful man,

223
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,371
but you know what?

224
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,810
That's normal to be scared.

225
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,100
That's a great emotion,

226
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:28,660
especially when you're a standup comic,

227
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,650
because when go,

228
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,940
the more schedule,

229
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,590
the better you're going to fucking do.

230
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,820
Especially in my case,

231
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,080
the more riled up I am.

232
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,940
Two minutes before I go on stage,

233
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,340
the more energy I'm going to
give that fucking audience.

234
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,780
But I've looked at my life and I've seen
how much fear I was petrified to go get

235
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:44,680
that fucking needle,

236
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,920
even though I fucking knew
nothing was going to happen.

237
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,010
I was going to walk out of there,

238
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,271
but I went in,

239
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,040
I took the needle after I
walked out of that and be like,

240
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,310
could have fucking killed 10 fucking
people with my bare hands because you

241
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,200
overcome one of your
biggest fucking fears.

242
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,810
Till this day I get
little emails and people,

243
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,510
you know,

244
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,290
I suffer,

245
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,801
I suffer,

246
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:04,400
I suffer from a social disorder and I
don't know what to do with the answer and

247
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,480
taking a fucking pill.

248
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,080
It's checking your fucking confidence and
grabbing your balls and walking into a

249
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:09,914
circle and saying,

250
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,581
fuck it.

251
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:11,330
I'm here.

252
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,601
You know,

253
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,960
my mentality was always go into little
mouth of the lion and put a chair down

254
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:17,690
and sit the fuck down and let
the pieces fall where they may.

255
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,310
And if you're not going to live like that,

256
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,263
fuck them more.

257
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,171
I'm at the store too.

258
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:21,741
Fucking nights.

259
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,251
Joe Rogan,

260
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,020
the first fucking night
Eddie Griffin bumps me.

261
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,130
You know how embarrassing it is?

262
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,900
You become a regular on a Sunday,

263
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,600
the first fucking night you let
bring 11 people that come see you,

264
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:32,300
your landlord comes and you
get bumped by Eddie Griffin.

265
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,890
And the second night I grew up getting,

266
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,690
Steve Greenstein says to me,

267
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:35,871
Hey,

268
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:38,500
last weekend you fucking
audition here for Mitson.

269
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,841
You said,

270
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:39,674
one of my jokes.

271
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,401
I said,

272
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,580
it's February fucking 11 I just come off
a plane January 29 and you're already

273
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,130
accusing me of being a fucking thief.

274
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,900
And remember he had his violin case.

275
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,380
Who?

276
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,340
Steve Greenstein,

277
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,080
I don't remember if it was a creepy guy,

278
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,660
older guy hanging out at the comedy store.

279
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,720
He had a violin case.

280
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,190
So this is a Tuesday night.

281
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,900
It's Black Knight at the comedy store.

282
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,861
It's eight o'clock.

283
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:01,190
The main room was packed with the original
room BMP because people were scared

284
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:03,020
to go up there and black knight because
they thought they were going to get

285
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:03,854
fucking mug.

286
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,420
So the original room was always empty.

287
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:07,160
So Steve Greenstein was up before me.

288
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:07,821
He get,

289
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,950
this is my second mentor comedies.

290
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,440
Good dog.

291
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,310
I just got to La.

292
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,660
I'm a fucking criminal.

293
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:12,351
I'd been in prison.

294
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:13,220
I got all these problems.

295
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,020
But for a first time my life,

296
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,460
I got a little fucking daylight,

297
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,100
the county store.

298
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,260
This lady made me a regular.

299
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:18,891
All my life.

300
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:19,311
People were like,

301
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:21,770
cause Mitzi shore seeing
you as Mitzi shore seen you.

302
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,200
She going to make your fucking regular.

303
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,043
I get down there,

304
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,690
I'm a regular is the first time
since my mother died a holiday look,

305
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,530
I had been in prison,

306
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,400
I had been divorced,

307
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:28,941
you know,

308
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:32,680
shot the whole fucking deal and the next
thing you know I become a regular is

309
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:36,470
Tuesday night and I get off stage and
I'm waiting to hang out for a little

310
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:36,681
while.

311
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:39,200
And Steve Greenstein comes
up to me and he says to me,

312
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:39,950
dog,

313
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,480
one of your jokes is like my joke.

314
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:41,751
I said,

315
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:42,141
which one?

316
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:44,300
He said something about Oj Simpson's May.

317
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,171
I got dog.

318
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,220
I didn't steal the joke from me.

319
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,440
I just fucking got here two weeks ago.

320
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:49,131
Wheels comes out,

321
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:49,610
he goes,

322
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,001
this guy,

323
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:50,990
that is still the joke from you.

324
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,470
The only problem was the guy put the
violin case behind this fucking legs and I

325
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:55,304
spotted it.

326
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,630
So he starts threatening me.

327
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,110
He's like dogs.

328
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,250
The next time you do their job,

329
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,084
we're going to have a problem.

330
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,051
I just pushed him.

331
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:00,591
Joe Rogan,

332
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:01,790
he fell over the violin case.

333
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,020
Why has he's fallen down.

334
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,670
Mitsis Limo pulls up.

335
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,350
That's it.

336
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,711
I'm like,

337
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:07,190
I'm done.

338
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,971
This is my life.

339
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,290
I'm fucking gun out of here.

340
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,900
I'm never going to get
another fucking spot again.

341
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,520
I'm going to go back to
selling and fucking blow and
wheels got between US Scott

342
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,580
Day gap between us and Mitzi came and go,

343
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,161
ah,

344
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:20,270
what happened here?

345
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,490
And he started saying that.

346
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,741
He goes,

347
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:22,041
no,

348
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:26,630
this kid's Cuban but bravado and but Mitzi
seen the kid on the floor and fell in

349
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,570
love with me after that cause
I had pushed that motherfucker.

350
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,440
She liked it cause I skipped
something from myself.

351
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:30,741
Sure.

352
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,221
You get lucky.

353
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,054
She was crazy.

354
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,500
She liked dark.

355
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,090
If that happened at the fuck and Improv,

356
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,560
I would have been out
on the fucking street.

357
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,490
How often did you perform at
the Improv and those days?

358
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,540
In those days?

359
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,231
Every week.

360
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,360
Because the Guy Richard Cooper loved me,

361
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:45,230
the talent coordinator.

362
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,440
But I got to La January 29th
that was a regular at the store.

363
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,940
February 19th on my birthday.

364
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,860
I didn't fuck around this
down when I got here,

365
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,890
but you couldn't do the
Improv and Mitzi found out.

366
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:56,280
But I went to Scott Bass had dog.

367
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,510
Richard Cooper gives me spots.

368
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,180
So I would go over there and I
had a couple problems over there.

369
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,110
Right off the fucking bat.

370
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:02,370
People thought they were cute over there.

371
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,091
You know,

372
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:03,390
you,

373
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,310
you leave your fucking
girlfriend and a seat,

374
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:05,941
you're going to baton,

375
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:06,690
you come back and talk.

376
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,201
And so I'm like,

377
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,550
they know that is an issue.

378
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:08,760
No,

379
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,630
it's a fucking issue.

380
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,170
You got to,

381
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,921
you got to stop.

382
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:11,251
I'm like,

383
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,930
I told you like Hitler
in Munich or if not,

384
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,340
you're going to have
a fucking problem dog.

385
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,030
So I would say things to people and all
of a sudden you're a bad fucking person.

386
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,410
So what the fuck?

387
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,250
I don't give a fuck.

388
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,830
And when he at 12 years later and
we're still rocking and rolling,

389
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,690
they can still suck my
dick and call me shorty.

390
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,950
[inaudible]

391
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:34,790
okay.
