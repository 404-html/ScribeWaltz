00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,290
Hello Freak bitches,
that fucking story that you're telling

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:07,130
on stage now,
the story that you told about the

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,130
prostitute situation when you encouraged
me to do it.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,910
So funny crying.
I'll,

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,660
I'll tell.
I'll tell a,

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,980
your our listeners now,
they're our listeners because everybody,

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,860
the Joe and Ron show.
Thank you.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,360
I'll be here every Thursday at 1:30.
But it was true.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,380
It's a lot of lost my virginity when I
was 18 years old to a girl,

10
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:37,731
a prostitute and a in Tijuana,
Mexico who was overweight and her teeth

11
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:43,140
had no general direction or color,
but she was well within my budget

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,840
but I got stationed at Pearl and if I
found that after a while when she'd been

13
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:53,670
on a one part of Awahoo wasn't hotel st
these really cute girls jumping your car

14
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,670
and blow you for $5.
And it was like the best deal I've ever

15
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:57,840
even heard of.
I mean,

16
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,400
I was like,
they're twice a day,

17
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:01,470
you know.
And uh,

18
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:05,400
I was there for eight months and then
six months ago I was watching this

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,810
documentary on transvestites and they
started talking about the transvestite

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,540
scene on hotel street on a wall who had
been there for 55 years.

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,660
I'm like,
no,

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,640
I let a hundred 50 dudes suck my dick.

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,150
What's the record?
What's the record before you find out?

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,950
Right when I went to record is that,
I don't know,

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,390
but God,
I have to be close.

26
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,250
You know,
I've dodged that bullet,

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,770
but I've come close a gang of time.
I think I've dodged a bullet.

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,581
Yeah.
If,

29
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,530
if I had to dodge the bullet,
Kudos.

30
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,430
Whenever thing pretended to be her,
apparently it tongue is a tongue and the

31
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:43,830
tooth is the tooth because you can't
tell man,

32
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:45,090
man from woman mouth.
Now,

33
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:46,920
if it would have been a hand job,
I'd been going,

34
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:47,910
hey,
you're a plumber dude.

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,840
That hand on my cock thick gorilla head.
Jesus,

36
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,420
what do you think I am?
Yeah.

37
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,210
And I would imagine that somebody who
has a Dick probably knows how to work

38
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,970
it.
I guess I'll tell you what,

39
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:02,510
these girls had made quick work at me
twice a day.

40
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,990
Forty five seconds.
I was in my little dots and headed back

41
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,420
to the ship.
Do you say girls with air quotes?

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,000
With air quotes girls?
Yeah.

43
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,010
Well I still don't like to think of them
as dude,

44
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:16,540
you know,
in my mind that I don't let myself go

45
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,880
there.
They're still hot little girls,

46
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,110
not little girls.
These were fully developed men with

47
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:24,600
Ted's Dad tits.
They did.

48
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,380
And I was always wondering what,
let me play with her pose,

49
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,020
you know,
they let you get some teddy,

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,770
but you started going down there where
the junk is and they were like swat and

51
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:37,900
your hand away and I'm like,
now that should have been,

52
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,540
you know,
my flag.

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,220
I don't know.
Yeah,

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,810
well now you know.
Yeah.

55
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,190
Right.
So what were you were in the navy?

56
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:48,450
Is that what you're doing?
How long?

57
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,730
I wasn't in real long.

58
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,410
Uh,
they uh,

59
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,500
you know,
I just wasn't cut out for it.

60
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,200
Uh,
that had,

61
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,670
that I had the wrong mouth for that.
Stayed in trouble.

62
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,480
I didn't,
you know,

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,760
it just did a lot of drugs and you know,
I just,

64
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,840
it was horrible out and then they
discharged me with an honorable

65
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:11,890
discharge under medical conditions from
the Naval Drug Rehabilitation Center in

66
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,120
Miramar,
California.

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,500
Oh Wow.
So what did,

68
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,780
what did you have to get rehabilitated
for?

69
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,240
Well,
I'd actually never seen drugs till I got

70
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,720
to the Naval Drug Rehabilitation Center
in Miramar,

71
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,670
California.
I mean everybody had drugs,

72
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,210
you know,
I was positive for heroin on a WESTPAC,

73
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,980
but,
so we're eight other people on the ship

74
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,630
and,
and uh,

75
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,690
and uh,
then when we ate a ton of acid and you

76
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,720
know,
it was 75 and that was 18 years old and

77
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,690
that was off the hook.
Wild.

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,640
And uh,
and you know,

79
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,290
they just started actually in my,
in my hearing to get me out the,

80
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,570
the,
the commander of our base called me a

81
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:56,930
hole in our national land of defense.
I'm like,

82
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,600
God,
that's horrible.

83
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,780
But what's worse than that?
I wonder

84
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,570
nothing like when you see their bodies,
you see a bear's body and you think of a

85
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:10,140
500 pound bear.
What's this thing would have 500 pound

86
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:11,730
dog could do to you?
Right?

87
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,601
Just think of that,
right?

88
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,580
A 500 pound dog.
Then.

89
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,780
Have you ever seen like a baby bear
wrestle a dog.

90
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,360
It's fucking hilarious.
Day.

91
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,710
It's like Habib Neuroma,
Gamete of wrestling.

92
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:27,670
Your grandmother.
This is bare.

93
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,860
Just throws this fucking dog around
legged a shit.

94
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,240
It's a little cub as a little baby bear.
Look,

95
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,260
look at this.
Gosh,

96
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,130
look,
the dog keeps fucking with them.

97
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,330
The bears way smaller than the bears.
Like.

98
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,260
All right bitch.
You want to get crazy?

99
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,190
All right,
let's get crazy.

100
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,580
So they start going to war and the bear,
the bear whips him to the ground.

101
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,480
They put the dog keeps fucking with the.
Look at this.

102
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:53,340
Boom.
Look around.

103
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:54,210
Wow,
dude.

104
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,240
He just throws him around.
He's way smaller than that dog.

105
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,260
The dog is like,
oh no.

106
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:59,370
What have I done?
Look at this.

107
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:00,300
Boom,
bitch.

108
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,430
Boom.
Side control.

109
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,010
Like the bear can do shit that dog can't
do.

110
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:08,640
The doc had only bite,
but that bear has ridiculous power in

111
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,650
those arms.
Show that last 15 seconds.

112
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:11,560
Again,
look,

113
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,760
he throws him.
He uses his hips like,

114
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:15,870
look,
go back a little bit.

115
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,270
This bear is like a fucking judo champ.
Like,

116
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:21,390
watch.
This is like some Cairo,

117
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,890
Parisians Shit.
Look,

118
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,750
boom.
He just throws them around.

119
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:27,210
Boom,
seriously.

120
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,390
Stocky risks around that.
Bail is.

121
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,960
That's like Daniel Cormier that bear.
He uses his hips,

122
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:36,510
man,
like instinctively uses his hips.

123
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,370
Now imagine one of those,
it's 500 pounds and wants to eat.

124
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:44,730
You.
Imagine what the fucking sheer terror of

125
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:45,360
that would be.
