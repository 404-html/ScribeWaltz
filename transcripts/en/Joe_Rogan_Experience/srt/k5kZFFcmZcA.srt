1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,540
Oh,
she like a bag of water.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,740
Okay.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,570
Yes.
Boys.

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:11,160
Yeah.
First of all,

5
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:13,950
that is a beautiful tell t shirt you're 
wearing there.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,860
Mr Sean Newest version of the Master 
Cam.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,160
Not out yet.
Accentuates is fucking dope.

8
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:25,161
Tiger man.
It's like sort of a half dragony tiger 

9
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:26,340
thing going on.
Very Asian with the and k?

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,040
Yeah man.
Who's doing your artwork?

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,410
I have a couple of guys.
This one I collabed with a guy,

12
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:36,411
his name's on Instagram,
painted demons and so the two guys I 

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,981
used,
they're both from tap out back in the 

14
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:41,721
tap out tap out days.
So Justin and this guy painted demons 

15
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:45,531
jettison.
We just get together with the world of 

16
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:45,750
tee shirts.
I love it.

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,170
The tap out thing is so strange.
It's like it's like there's a few 

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:51,240
companies like that,
right?

19
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:53,040
Like von Dutch remember?
Yeah.

20
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,750
Yeah.
And then von Dutch.

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,580
That became ed hardy.
I want really know,

22
00:00:58,581 --> 00:00:59,180
but you know what I mean?

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Right.
The people that would have warned van 

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,620
dot if they had been five years younger,
we're now wearing ed hardy.

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,180
Hardy retarded.
I don't know why it wasn't legit tattoo 

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,530
artists.
Super legit.

27
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:11,700
Yeah.
I mean he has.

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,370
He's like a famous tat.
I think he's dead.

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,330
Is he dead?
Well,

30
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:19,110
the kind of guys that were like,
they're usually easy.

31
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:23,670
I used to wear some metal,
but they're usually super killer guys.

32
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,530
Shaved their forearms.
They got the skin,

33
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,620
like a hot dog to use your term.
Jersey shore.

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Here's the deal.
I mean we can demonize those guys all 

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,370
day long and we do and it's funny,
but they're just trying to get laid.

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,850
No.
The only reason why we don't.

37
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:38,320
We wouldn't wear those things if we were
all going.

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,690
We're rhinestones because you're looking
to fuck your buddy.

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,300
Do they've done studies that when a man 
wears jewelry,

40
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,640
Don Ed Hardy,
born in 1945.

41
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,590
He's still alive.
Wow.

42
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,260
That's your sweet ass.
He's alive.

43
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,220
He looks a lot younger there.
No,

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,190
that's.
I'm kidding.

45
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:58,191
I'm kidding.
That's a different guy with a shitty 

46
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:58,191
shirt.
Is known for those sailor tattoos.

47
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,010
Original sailor tattoos.
Yeah.

48
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,090
He was like one of the.
The great American.

49
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:05,620
A tattoo artists.
He would make those really cool like,

50
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,660
like his,
his stuff was not realistic looking at 

51
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:10,660
all.
It's like cartoonish.

52
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,080
There is no good and powerful man.
He looks awesome.

53
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,010
He made a bank.
He looks like a closet.

54
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,700
It's just weird that a tattoo artists 
like I knew him from the tattoo 

55
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:20,700
magazines.
Yeah,

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,010
because before I ever got a tattoo,
I was like really?

57
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:28,011
Into tattoos.
I'd buy the magazines and check out all 

58
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:28,011
the really cool art wars.

59
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:29,430
Like Paul booth.
You ever see that guy?

60
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,840
Yeah,
I'm down in New Jersey.

61
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,250
Oh God.
Damn that guy.

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,730
That guy.
He won't let you tell him what to draw.

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,910
Really?
Yup.

64
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,940
Yup.
He just got to trust him.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,330
Yep.
He's got his style and his style is like

66
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:44,340
demonic,
white eyeballs,

67
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,530
black and gray.
Really cool.

68
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,710
Super detailed.
Amazing Tattoos.

69
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,300
Here's.
Look at this fucking guy.

70
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,300
He looks like Paul booth.
He does.

71
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,470
He doesn't look like he's going to take 
no for an answer.

72
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,010
I'm using your body as an experiment and
look at that poster.

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,590
The back fighting terrorism since 1490.
That's the American Indians.

74
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,980
Native American,
Diana t shirt like that.

75
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,610
Really?
Yeah.

76
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,800
I stopped wearing it.
I felt like I felt like,

77
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,210
what am I,
what is this message?

78
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,430
I'm doing what I'm doing,
what should I.

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
I might sleep out just because I want to
be 49 sleeved.

80
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm 48 and sleeves.

81
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,170
Yeah,
but somehow it fits you.

82
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,730
What?
I'd like tattoos,

83
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,750
man.
If you like tattoos,

84
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,130
it fits you.
I love the artwork,

85
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,150
the art that goes into it.
I love it and as I get older I like 

86
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,930
girls that are tattooed on me.
Didn't used to like them.

87
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,700
I used to always love.
I used to be like,

88
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,590
are you crazy?
Damaged Bitch.

89
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm like,
wait a minute.

90
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,580
I'm a crazy damage bitch too man.
Guys,

91
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,730
crazy damn website I ever bought,
like subscribe to where I used a credit 

92
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:50,701
card to get access is suicide girls.
That's how much they turned me off.

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,730
But that's just pictures,
right?

94
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,670
They don't even know.
Just pictures.

95
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,780
I didn't,
I didn't check off.

96
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,250
I just would look at him and be like,
no,

97
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,470
you jacked off for sure one.
Otherwise why would you give them a 

98
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,740
chronic masturbator?
But I that I have youtube or you know,

99
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,180
fucking red tube and all that stuff,
but that there's an attraction to a girl

100
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:15,181
that covers her back and her arms with 
tattoos for some reason because this 

101
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:15,181
girl doesn't give a fuck.

102
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:15,850
She's,
well,

103
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,160
she knows that this is permanent.
And she's like,

104
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:19,030
yeah,
whatever.

105
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,060
Drawn me pull up pictures of that Paul 
booth stuff because some of his stuff is

106
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:25,510
insane.
He did.

107
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:30,490
I'm that dude.
Who a fucking.

108
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,510
Yeah,
look at that kind of shame,

109
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,820
man.
I'm putting that on my body though.

110
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,470
I'm going to need to see the artwork 
before you put them.

111
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,030
It's really not.
But he's so good,

112
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:38,260
dude.
People wait for years.

113
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Hold on.
Back up to that one with the tentacles 

114
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,790
please.
Fucking insane.

115
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,120
See,
I would get that.

116
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,540
But it'd be like,
why is Brian doing that?

117
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,680
Well,
why isn't it?

118
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,880
See that's your problem.
Let me tell you what your problem is,

119
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,490
your problem,
and you're worried about what people 

120
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:58,490
think.
Well that shit ain't good for you.

121
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,480
I don't.
I don't know that.

122
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah,
you do.

123
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,650
Definitely.
That's why you don't have a nice car.

124
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,240
And that's why you would.
You were weird.

125
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,400
Shoes at zipped up on the side,
getting a tesla.

126
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,850
Tesla.
I ordered a fucking drive themselves.

127
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:13,920
I know that.
That I now know craziness.

128
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,000
I got the autopilot to Tom Papa about 
it.

129
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,290
Yeah,
well I'm getting one.

130
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,720
I'm picking it up in March 31st.
My,

131
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,580
my buddy Matt,
Matt Lichtenberg,

132
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,560
he's got one and he said he gets on the 
highway.

133
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,040
He,
he,

134
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,210
you press a button twice.
I guess it drives itself and he just 

135
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,210
starts texting people.
Not,

136
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,350
not for me,
man.

137
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,570
That's just not for me.
I said to the guy,

138
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,630
he explained it to me at the Tesla 
dealership and I said I wouldn't use 

139
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:36,630
that.
And he said,

140
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,600
Oh yes,
you will in the future.

141
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,500
Especially you.
And how much traffic here.

142
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,050
That makes sense.
Listen man,

143
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:48,310
when you have a nice car,
it makes driving a fun experience.

144
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,590
Whereas if you have a look,
there's nothing wrong with just having a

145
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,130
utilitarian car.
You know,

146
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,080
Brock Lesnar,
he used to drive around in like,

147
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,980
it was like a chevy citation,
something like that.

148
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,420
It was like some weird little red 
fucking compact car that guy used to get

149
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:06,220
in that thing and he's what?
All of 300 pounds.

150
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,320
He was a fucking every fucking thicker 
than he makes.

151
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,410
He.
He makes me like when I stand next to 

152
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:14,410
him,
like we're not the same species.

153
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,460
It's a totally different kinds of humans
I've ever seen him.

154
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,880
I was like,
maybe this isn't for me.

155
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,970
I'm shaking people's hands before,
like shack,

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
shake,
shack's hands check as these.

157
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,150
But there's two guys like Shane Corwin 
and Lesner.

158
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,910
Both those guys.
You shake their hand,

159
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:28,490
you go,
okay,

160
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,850
we're not the same thing.
I tried getting hit with one of those 

161
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,280
fucking beach on ours for me because I 
didn't grow up with any cars.

162
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,690
Like my,
my parents were never in the cars.

163
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,870
So if you don't know the difference,
like sometimes you got to know the 

164
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,180
difference,
like you grow up with it.

165
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,920
But yeah,
I didn't grow up with it.

166
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:53,921
I just didn't grow up with it.
I don't think I've ever driven a fast 

167
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:56,951
car.
I drove a porsche once in traffic and I 

168
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:56,951
couldn't open it up,
so I didn't.

169
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:57,680
I just don't.
I didn't grow up.

170
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,790
I grew up appreciating what the car was.
He tried to ask him to drive my car,

171
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,890
like,
fuck no.

172
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,380
Take his car up to like little to 
hunger.

173
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,030
Like to drive a stick.
I do.

174
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,510
Yeah,
I can.

175
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,600
I started learning on a stick isn't,
I'll let you drive the gt three.

176
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,110
It'll change your life.
He'd be like crazy eyes.

177
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:15,710
I'm fucking Mr.
d dot.

178
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,390
I'm trying to change your life.

179
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,950
He would ruin your car.
No,

180
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:19,340
no,
no.

181
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,560
He drives good.
He's a good driver.

182
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,150
But you would,
uh,

183
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,240
you would understand maybe the list at 
the beginning of my.

184
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,770
Oh,
the test was really fast.

185
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,860
Super fast.
One of the best cars in the world.

186
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:32,840
Especially download that APP.
It's still.

187
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,610
Well,
he told me that they can,

188
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,240
like if I,
if I want it faster than they can 

189
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,240
upgrade it.
Yeah.

190
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,780
There's like some insane mode.
I don't think you need that though.

191
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,290
Chris alluded to this group.
I don't think you need that though.

192
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,600
Two point eight seconds.
Zero to 60 in two point eight seconds.

193
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,270
Crazy.
Of course I don't need a four door sedan

194
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:55,271
puts in Saint Dan to hit 60 and less 
than three seconds end with no sound.

195
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,850
Right?
It's like there's no rumble.

196
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:03,851
There's no explosions.
Like there are two things I wish I want 

197
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,180
to start wearing,
but it's too late for me.

198
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,020
I want that Tattoo.
Get the hand do it.

199
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,700
He might do it,
but he might do something better.

200
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:11,720
You just got to go to him.
Well,

201
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:14,450
I also want to where I can't do that.
I can't do that.

202
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,900
Just trust it.
Fucking like snake.

203
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:18,290
Sorry Bro.
That's what you get.

204
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,850
That's how it works.
Maybe you could say,

205
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,240
look,
my mom was killed by today.

206
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,290
Could you lay off the snakes and he 
would just do like bats or is he going 

207
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,160
to get what you're going to get a snake.
I mean,

208
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,730
he's a fucking artist essentially.
Not essentially a hundred percent.

209
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,250
Yeah.
And he looks at his art and he says,

210
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:39,251
you know what man,
people commission me to do pieces and 

211
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:42,221
this is what I want to do.
So I'm just going to say I'm only going 

212
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,220
to take that work.
I get it that the southern wrong though.

213
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,520
I mean,
I believe my.

214
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,370
That's how he does it.
I've that.

215
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,790
That's how he does it.
I'm pretty sure.

216
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,160
I don't think there's no bigger artists 
than in southern cal for tattoo artists.

217
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,410
It's the scene man,
for sure.

218
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,680
Oh yeah.
That's a great spot.

219
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,520
If not the best in the world.
I mean it is fucking killers here.

220
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,300
The shamrock yet cartoon.
Yet in Osi got some killers.

221
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,600
There's.
Well there's on d all over the country 

222
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:09,600
right now.
There's a resurgence in tattooing,

223
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,161
like tattooing over the last few decades
has become like a really respected art 

224
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:16,440
form instead of just like,
a lot of them were like Weirdo,

225
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,900
fringe type artists who just were really
into it.

226
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,820
But there's a stigma attached to it,
you know,

227
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:23,130
there's always a stigma attached to 
being tattooed up,

228
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,550
you know?
And now it's not like if you have 

229
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,501
tattoos like Aaron Dove,
a dove did this and this was like 50 

230
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:30,501
hours of work,
you know?

231
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:33,210
And he planned it all out as one sleep.
He did this one too.

232
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:37,200
He just both really good,
but he's a friend too,

233
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,940
so like I go down there and we hang.

234
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,120
He's cool as fuck.
He's an amazing artist.

235
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,460
You get a close bond with your tattoo 
artists.

236
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,190
Like Freddy Negretti,
who's,

237
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,060
who's done all this from shamrock social
club in Hollywood there and you know,

238
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,720
he's,
he grew up rough man.

239
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,390
He started tattooing in prison so he 
still rough dude,

240
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,640
but the first hour with them I was like,
God,

241
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,100
this is the worst he was.
I wasn't talking to me,

242
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,840
was kind of me a long time,
but then he opened up and he's my bullet

243
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:04,410
now.
Man.

244
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,770
Just the straight means just.
Yeah,

245
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,860
it's great.
Maybe he was worried that you were like 

246
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:12,860
a dumb jock type care.
One hundred percent.

247
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,980
You're very deceiving in that way.
Like a lot of people have the wrong idea

248
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:20,220
of you and they also like people get mad
at you from podcasts.

249
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,280
Ladies and gentlemen,
I know it's fun to hate and I've done it

250
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,170
before,
but you've got to understand and we're,

251
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,880
we,
we play up shit.

252
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,460
Like what do you ramp things up?
You say ridiculous shit.

253
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,790
He knows what he's doing.
He's doing it because it's ridiculous to

254
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,470
say.
Yeah,

255
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,600
I want to act as a natural showman.
It's fun.

256
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,140
It's so much comedy is about 
exaggeration sometimes.

257
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,090
A lot of it,
a lot of it is.

258
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,320
I mean,
that's some of the funniest shit.

259
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,190
Yeah,
you know.

260
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,470
But I think tattoos for me is I,
I think,

261
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,450
uh,
one I didn't.

262
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,400
I don't know that I express tattooing.
I don't know that there's anything I,

263
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,520
I can,
I can never make up my mind first of 

264
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:58,520
all,
what I'd want them to be.

265
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,580
Harmony making it too big of a deal.
Like I don't give them what it looks so 

266
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:03,060
good about your arm by itself.
Well,

267
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:05,140
the must look at this.
Try Haitian.

268
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,400
Even if a separate.
If you have a nice arm,

269
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,100
if you have a big muscle,
you,

270
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,090
your arms fit mean you're fit.
You're a fit guy,

271
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,800
but it's just skin.
Okay.

272
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,050
You go to a great artist and you have 
art on your body.

273
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,810
What would I get?
Permanent art or whatever you want.

274
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,520
Well,
you know what,

275
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,820
why don't you guys both get fighter in 
the kid tattoos.

276
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Boom.
Send video once we get to 10 million 

277
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,540
downloads here to get a tattoo.
That was the deal.

278
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,870
We made that bet.
Wow.

279
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,710
Lucky.
Not On my show.

280
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,370
Tesla.

281
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,970
What do you.
What are you going to get fucking now?

282
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,310
Hey Man.
I'm going to go all out.

283
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:44,010
I'm going to go balls out and just get 
Medusa on my back.

284
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Medusa Medusa big one.
Of course.

285
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,050
He's a god Damn America.
Sorry.

286
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,830
Congress.
You heard of King Kong?

287
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,070
Are you

288
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,490
familiar with big fuck.
You need to know about gorillas pro.

289
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,330
Sorry,
but do you ever see lassie,

290
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,390
Bro?
You know,

291
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,730
flip.
It was not a fish,

292
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,910
right?
Funny I got last year.

293
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,020
Do you know?
It's a big smiley last shitty lassie I 

294
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:17,371
got last year on my back.
It doesn't serone up last year of his 

295
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:17,371
back.
No,

296
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:17,371
no.
He has a pimple.

297
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:18,790
It people when he's a kid.
Oh my bed.

298
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,580
It's like,
no,

299
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,740
I don't think so man.
It's a good dad to have his dog,

300
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:30,090
his,
his dog from when he was a kid passed 

301
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,090
away.
I'd like to get something silly.

302
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,300
Maybe a cow.
Ari should fear God.

303
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:33,450
Keep on trucking.
Tattooed on his body.

304
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,990
It's brilliant hip dude.
I love it.

305
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,280
I love that.
I love that dude.

306
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,840
There's some great tattoos in doc and 
there's some terrible tattooed.

307
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:51,590
Nice Crystal.
It's been nice to have some shitty 

308
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,750
tattoos myself in.

309
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,860
GRC could slow down a little bit.
The one on the stomach's a little too 

310
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,681
real for me on the stomach and then the 
mcgregor above it and he gave up his 

311
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,310
abs,
so that's what bothers me.

312
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,410
People have killed themselves for that.
ABS will give up your apps for that.

313
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,440
I could've done without the big crown 
being that up his neck tat I like the 

314
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,870
straight blast gym.
Gorilla.

315
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,810
And then the crown on top of it.
I think that's my favorite tattoo.

316
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,500
The writing up his back.
I like that.

317
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:23,990
Well,
that's weird.

318
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,010
And I like symmetry.
Like suicide.

319
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:32,011
Girls like it or do.
I crashed for like a website that I.

320
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,950
his phone.
Your wife had been cats?

321
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,990
No.
Now I'm going to get her a tattoo that 

322
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:39,990
says mine.
Ooh.

323
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,390
Oh.
Anybody could use that one though.

324
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,260
Yeah,
that's true.

325
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,960
You put council Mylans now.

326
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,070
Mine.
My mind of women don't like that.

327
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,810
They don't like to be owned.
Yeah.

328
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:54,811
At my or do the at my wedding.
I said twitter ones with tattoos do at 

329
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:54,811
my wedding.
I,

330
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:59,501
I,
I've made a speech and thank my parents 

331
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,861
and everybody and I stopped and I went 
and Amanda you are and there was 

332
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:06,271
waiting.
They were praising like I was going to 

333
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:06,271
say something really sweet.
I went to,

334
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,790
man,
you are my property now and that's what 

335
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,180
this is about folks.
And everybody started laughing.

336
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,750
Did you get a dowery?
I did not get a doubt right.

337
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,860
There used to be.
You marry your daughter off.

338
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:18,100
Daughters are so useless.
You gotta you gotta give gifts stuff.

339
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,600
Hey,
you know who cries at weddings?

340
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,000
This guy.
Oh Sweetie.

341
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,350
I tried.
I could not.

342
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,630
I cried my eyes out.
I don't know what it is about weddings.

343
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,550
Divorce.
Divorce is coming.

344
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,580
Yeah,
because you know at my sister's wedding 

345
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:32,990
I was in the wedding and your sister.
But that's what they.

346
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,400
The reason why they used to give away a 
dowery was because the woman was thought

347
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:38,590
of as being less valuable than the man,
right?

348
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:43,591
Because there's times are tough and 
people were dying in war and famine and 

349
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,101
fucking sword fights and shit.
So like if you had daughters like the 

350
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:50,851
way you would marry them off to a good 
person that you have to give them 

351
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:53,971
something,
give the dude something to marry your 

352
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:54,290
daughter,
so you'd get like,

353
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,110
here's my,
here's a bag full of gold coins,

354
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,470
a ton of cash,
but that was the way that was like super

355
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:02,170
calm.
Let's bring this shit back.

356
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,180
But it didn't go the other way.
That's what it was fascinating about 

357
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,170
modern culture is the divorce is 
horrific for men.

358
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,410
Marriage and divorce can often be 
horrific for men financially and just 

359
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:19,020
from the limited amount of exchanges 
I've had with friends that have been 

360
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,040
divorced.
It's fucking horrific.

361
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,370
The amount of money they lose,
especially in California and the amount 

362
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:24,370
of money they have to give off because 
you know,

363
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,520
we know a few people that have done 
well.

364
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:30,521
It made good money and then you know,
it doesn't go well when it comes to the 

365
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:33,170
divorce and you find out the sums of 
money they have to pay out when you have

366
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:36,350
to maintain their lifestyle when you 
guys were together.

367
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,850
Exactly.
And if you're a fighter.

368
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:42,200
I'm a fighter friend who went through a 
divorce and at the time when he was with

369
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,980
her,
you know,

370
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:46,880
he's a bad ass making bank.
We'll the career's over,

371
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,680
you know,
it's tough man.

372
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,530
It is tough.
It's just crazy athletes especially.

373
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,560
But it's weird how it switched around 
like it used to be that the man would 

374
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,400
get a lot out of getting married to the 
woman,

375
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,220
so it'd be worth something.
It'd be like a big thing,

376
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,960
like they had to give up a dowery and 
now becomes the woman if she decides,

377
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,590
you know,
there's a lot of power in that.

378
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,980
A few,
especially if you marry a rich guy,

379
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,200
you know,
you married some Donald Trump character.

380
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,160
Even if he's got a lock down,
fucking Prenup,

381
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,640
prenup.
Still set son.

382
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,200
Especially if have a kid.
Yeah.

383
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,950
He'll give you a few minutes just to get
the fuck away from this.

384
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,550
If Donald Trump writes you a check for 2
million bucks,

385
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,290
he makes that an a month.
Yeah.

386
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,420
That ain't no to him.
Not even a month.

387
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Yeah.
It makes it in a week when you've got a 

388
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:34,440
billion dollars.
$4,000,

389
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,880
million dollars.
That's insane.

390
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:36,590
It's kind of crazy.

391
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,790
Apparently he doesn't have that much 
money,

392
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,090
but yeah,
he's worth 10,

393
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,810
but they say he's probably worth four.
I read estimates that he,

394
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:49,811
if you actually look at,
if you take out the debt and everything 

395
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:50,510
and how much he puts into his business,
if you actually looked at what he has,

396
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:54,850
moneywise is closer to 200 million broke
ass bitch fucking know.

397
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,310
That can be 100 million.
That can be hating on them though.

398
00:16:57,311 --> 00:17:00,260
Is that according to John Oliver and 
some other stuff,

399
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:05,261
I read haters.
It's a tough thing to figure out,

400
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:08,860
but you can apparently look at his 
assets he's not releasing.

401
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:13,861
You can look at how much it costs.
You can estimate what it would cost to 

402
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:15,620
run those based on employees and 
insurance and all that,

403
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:20,830
and then they have to.
A lot of times I think a lot of 

404
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:20,830
companies,
I mean certainly if they're public,

405
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,240
but I don't know private,
but there are statements,

406
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,600
there are tax,
there are public tax for trump.

407
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:29,300
Men Struggle is real and people can stay
only 200 mil.

408
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,240
Yeah,
but I don't know.

409
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,550
Yeah,
I just think we don't know.

410
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,670
So we probably should be throwing 
numbers rather rich's.

411
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,290
He's rich as fuck.
You know what's hilarious man?

412
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,930
I watched a little bit of the Democrat 
Democrat debate.

413
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,020
I usually don't like bates,
but Bernie Sanders sent it home that he 

414
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,130
sent it home.
Hillary Clinton.

415
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,380
Dude,
like there's some shit that she couldn't

416
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:57,381
say nothing about it.
When they were talking about the 

417
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:57,381
pharmaceutical industries and the 
banking industry,

418
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:58,320
the banking industry in particular he 
was talking about,

419
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,880
that's what it was.
He was talking about the speeches that 

420
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,200
she gives for hundreds of thousands of 
dollars and then you know,

421
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,320
he's talking about how many of you like 
that?

422
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:12,321
Why?
Why can't we get the transcripts from 

423
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:13,200
these speeches?
What an amazing speech it must have been

424
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:16,770
to be worth $250,000
or whatever the fuck it was.

425
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,330
And Hillary was nervous as fuck.
She threw a cough drop in her mouth.

426
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,240
She's sweating and like half fake 
smiling.

427
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,010
She can't say anything.
He's like,

428
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:31,011
you could read the transcripts of all 
the times I've performed and did 

429
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:34,440
speeches in front of the banking 
industry because there are none.

430
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,470
Damn,
this is a guy who took his.

431
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,690
He took his vacation with his wife and 
the Soviet Union.

432
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,280
Yeah,
he's an interesting guy.

433
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,040
He's a very interesting site.
I tweeted out last night,

434
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,370
it's called [inaudible] dot com.
You know,

435
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,690
I'm not too into politics.
We go this and they have like all the 

436
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,701
major issues can click multiple choice.
What what you think is major and goes 

437
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,190
through all of them and that then it 
says who you most likely should vote for

438
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:00,690
it because your percentage is pretty 
dope.

439
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,580
Well,
see my.

440
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,220
My feeling about Hillary is she seems 
like business as usual.

441
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,650
Yeah.
Whether she would be good or not.

442
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,680
She's 100 percent businesses usually,
and I think that is the last shit this 

443
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,610
country needs right now is this same 
system,

444
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,820
so he tried to bring in trump.
I would bring in Bernie or trump for 

445
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,220
bringing hillary,
although Bernie,

446
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:25,221
I'd bring in Bernie because I think that
he would shake shit up culturally,

447
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,480
but it's the best thing though.

448
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,320
See,
but here's the thing.

449
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:29,790
Here's the thing.
He can't do that.

450
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,580
He can't really pass all that.
You need congress and stuff.

451
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,530
The idea of what he's trying to tax.
It's socialism.

452
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,470
It doesn't.
It's kind of crazy.

453
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,100
It's,
it's.

454
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,310
It defies human nature because human 
nature,

455
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:47,940
when you give people a way to not have 
to work for things they do and some.

456
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,220
There's some people that fall upon hard 
times.

457
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,500
There's some people that they got a bad 
break,

458
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:54,930
a bum steer in life.
There's a bunch of people that are doing

459
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:59,931
poorly that it's not their fault,
but there's also a bunch of people that 

460
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:00,600
are just fucking lazy.
Probably the majority,

461
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,820
once you say no,
I don't know what the numbers are.

462
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:06,550
I've never examined.
Penalize people that produce yes,

463
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,290
and you don't want to tax people to 
produce who also create wealth,

464
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,470
but you don't want to tax them 75 
percent the way France under Orland is 

465
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,650
trying to do and has done.

466
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,190
It just doesn't work out because people 
that produce will stop producing.

467
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:23,670
If I have to work 75 percent of my day 
for someone else for the greater good,

468
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,100
hell no.
We've seen how that works in.

469
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,370
Just pick up a history book.
It doesn't work that well.

470
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,280
How will we as Bernie his oldest fuck 
his ass ain't gonna make it.

471
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,490
Last question.
Should always be rather than Bernie or 

472
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,090
just to ask yourself to what percentage,
what percentage are you willing to give 

473
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,720
your power and your money?
Like is it 50 percent duties?

474
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,760
It unfortunately for me,
I have no fucking investment this site 

475
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,480
and literally breaks it down.
It's a lot of stuff I didn't know about.

476
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:57,481
It breaks down very simple.
You just multiple choice and it shows 

477
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:00,810
bone.
This is who believes in the way you do 

478
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:00,810
and this is who you should believes in 
the way you do.

479
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,630
Fuck man.
The one I would never think Hillary 

480
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,630
Clinton see,
but here's the thing,

481
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,040
she's a centrist.
Can't tell what she really believes in.

482
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,150
That's right away.
She was what she said about Nancy Reagan

483
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,250
and Ronald Reagan.
A fucking liberals are abandoning her 

484
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,880
now because she was trying to say that 
Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan opened up

485
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,980
the conversation about aids during the 
eighties.

486
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,460
That is total bullshit.
Not only is it total bullshit,

487
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,740
silence is death is like a campaign 
because they weren't talking about it.

488
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,040
They wouldn't talk about aids for 
fucking years.

489
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,780
Two years.
I remember it very well and that wasn't 

490
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,150
a good administration just because Nancy
died.

491
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,960
Yeah,
she died and I,

492
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,640
I bet she was a nice lady.
You know,

493
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,330
she was really into astrology and she's 
married to a president.

494
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,950
That's it.
We're done here.

495
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,040
You don't have to lie about them opening
up some sort of a fucking dialogue with 

496
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,760
this country,
but eight,

497
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,940
that's just not what they did.

498
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,300
Hillary's biggest liability is that 
people don't trust her.

499
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:00,430
She's just not based on her.
Based on her history.

500
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,970
That was another thing in the debate.
They said 37 percent.

501
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,160
Yeah,
that was.

502
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,200
That is insane.
Truster only 37 percent trusted women in

503
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,310
your country and there's no women trust 
or less and so crazy.

504
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,920
Yeah,
and it needs a stylist.

505
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,160
Here's the.
Here's the fucker.

506
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,730
Here's the biggest thing I have them do.
If she is more like Obama,

507
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,090
if you look at the past six years,
the economy right now is not doing 

508
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,260
terribly and this is a guy who believes 
probably I'm a little bit more to the 

509
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,010
right at least fiscally than someone 
like Obama,

510
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,160
but I have to say that,
you know,

511
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,620
I was preaching about how,
you know,

512
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,410
under Obama,
if you look at his policies,

513
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:42,010
the government is going to grow the 
government because of a lot of factors.

514
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,520
It's not just Obama,
but if you look at a lot of measures for

515
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:50,521
how government is grown,
it's kind of stayed exactly flat in the 

516
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:50,521
past six years.
It hasn't grown.

517
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,730
A lot of.
That's because we don't have as big a 

518
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,980
tax base and things like that,
but there are a lot of factors that go 

519
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:56,980
into it.
But you know what,

520
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,130
in six years,
it's not like the economist disaster in 

521
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,580
by a lot of measures.
The economy's doing really well.

522
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,910
So that's hard for conservatives to 
argue with you.

523
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:07,990
No.
Let me just.

524
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,050
What's the word?
Blind allegiance.

525
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:14,230
No,
but devil's advocate.

526
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,910
Blind allegiance popped into my head.
I'm like,

527
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,200
why is that word?
I was like,

528
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:22,290
awesome word though.
But if you look at it from a Republican 

529
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,380
point of view,
one thing that can be easily argued,

530
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:28,381
this is a common cycle of recession and 
financial gain.

531
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,580
It happens.
Yeah.

532
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,800
And this is exactly what happens after a
downfall.

533
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,240
The downfall of our economy in 2008.
I don't know shit about finance,

534
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:42,241
but I've read a bunch of stuff that 
people do know shit about and these 

535
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:43,600
cycles are reoccurring cycles.
Like there's always,

536
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,390
as long as the republic stays up and 
it's still up and running.

537
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,270
So he goes down and crashes.
People readjust.

538
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,760
Some people find their way,
some people lose their way.

539
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:55,460
Some people jump off buildings and then 
it builds back again.

540
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,700
And that's what's going on right now.
So that's one of the things that they 

541
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:00,700
argued about Clinton's era.
They were saying,

542
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,411
well,
you could say that Bill Clinton was 

543
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:05,411
responsible for all that,
but the,

544
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:10,300
all the signs seem to indicate that the 
cycle is moving in that direction 

545
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,291
anyway.
No matter who is the president doesn't 

546
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,350
have gone out of my ass for sure,
and I don't know it exactly.

547
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,890
But if trump wins,
if trump wins,

548
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,930
is there going to be chaos?
Chaos.

549
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:25,931
People are people.
Black people are already freaking the 

550
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,640
fuck out that he fights at his fucking 
bore,

551
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,860
rushing the stage.
The numbers don't add up for trump.

552
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,500
He doesn't have women,
he doesn't have the minorities.

553
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,950
And I don't think you're right.
Uh,

554
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,430
you'll see I've known.
But look,

555
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,760
you can't take.
It all comes down to him.

556
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,530
I don't really know what I'm saying.
Get the nomination.

557
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,610
Okay.
But all I'm saying is you don't really 

558
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,850
know.
And the problem is it's real possible.

559
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,580
It's really just the idea that we've got
this far.

560
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,500
It's insane,
insane.

561
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,590
A lot of Republicans would tell you that
the Republicans,

562
00:24:57,591 --> 00:24:59,690
once again,
because they're not unified,

563
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:04,691
have committed political suicide.
The pundits that I've listened to will 

564
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:06,440
basically look at these hard numbers and
say,

565
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,860
you know,
the people that you see supporting 

566
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:11,860
trump.

567
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:11,860
Yeah.
Trump has one,

568
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:11,860
you know,
but,

569
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,120
but for the most part,
the,

570
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,340
the popular vote isn't there for him.
At the end of the day.

571
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,900
It's going to go to Hillary.
I'll see someone.

572
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,930
I don't think so.
Yeah.

573
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,980
We'll see.
Yeah,

574
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:22,880
we'll,
we will see.

575
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:24,350
I think.
Here's the problem.

576
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,680
He hasn't even started to attack her yet
and he's going to attack from Ben Gazi.

577
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,820
She could be indicted.
That's the other thing,

578
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,740
two different cases,
man.

579
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,250
She's indicted.
It's a big issue when we do,

580
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:42,251
you know about the guy who was the uh,
the computer analysts that put together 

581
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:43,850
her email server.
Fucking got immunity.

582
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,640
He just said he just got immunity 
against prosecution apparently so.

583
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,990
So he can know so little about this.
I shouldn't be.

584
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,680
So then he's going to squeal like a 
little piggy squeals like a little 

585
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:56,680
piggy.
You got real problems.

586
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,490
But the idea of giving him immunity with
the real.

587
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,610
I know I read that somewhere.
Make sure that I just give him like 300 

588
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:03,610
middle to go away.
She can't.

589
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,570
She doesn't have that kind of money.
She makes good money,

590
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,740
but I'm sure she spends it.
A lack of motherfucker.

591
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,760
The payouts per year from every lane.
They get insane amounts of money.

592
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,350
Really just her in trump.
Well,

593
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,760
insert her speaking monies off the 
charts.

594
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,260
What does it,
what does it say?

595
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,080
Scroll down please.
Justice Department grants.

596
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,270
Immunity to staff who set up Clinton 
email server.

597
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:24,620
Yeah,
so it's true.

598
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,610
So what that means is if they did that,
that means that they're thinking about a

599
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:33,050
case and they're probably planning case.
And if this guy gave up immunity,

600
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:36,470
that means he's got some serious fucking
information to get a bigger fish.

601
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,460
Who's the bigger fish?
Hillary Clinton that she don't like.

602
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:44,070
That is crazy because the choices so 
poor,

603
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,350
terrible.
Well,

604
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,070
because are the smart people of American
saying,

605
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,110
fuck that job.
Mind Bernie Sanders.

606
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:54,111
I'm telling you,
I would almost be willing to give up 

607
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:54,111
more money.
He's too old.

608
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:58,370
Here's the problem.
Here's the problem that I have with the 

609
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,680
given up more money though,
is that you're giving up more money to 

610
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:00,680
the government and I don't trust the 
government.

611
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,000
That's all.
If I could give up money or if.

612
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,450
If you could,
here's the thing.

613
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,540
If you could have mandated charity for 
really wealthy people where you could 

614
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,660
give to like I like to give to something
like Justin wren is we're going to fight

615
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:14,340
for the forgotten.
That's a no brainer.

616
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,500
I give to that one because I know 
exactly where the money's going.

617
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:17,600
That's a beautiful one.
Exactly.

618
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,700
But if you could get like a bunch of 
good ones,

619
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,140
you know,
like a good.

620
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,790
Yeah.
You know I probably.

621
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,780
The problem is so much of that money 
goes to running the machine that's 

622
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,500
supposed to dole out the crew,
including Red Cross.

623
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:35,100
By the way,
if you look online,

624
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:40,130
there's a few websites that detail what 
percentage of your dollar actually goes 

625
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:43,350
to the charity.
Really listen at one point,

626
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:44,520
at one point,
the united way,

627
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:47,190
at one point I remember they had a 
special on it.

628
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,790
One cent of every dollar was actually 
going to the charity.

629
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,510
The ninety nine cents was going to 
running the actual company.

630
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,240
Not only that,
but high salaries.

631
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:01,241
Ceos like the whole deal.
It becomes a quick wounded warrior 

632
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:01,770
project.
Do you see that?

633
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,800
No.
What I was just rocking the hat the 

634
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,400
other day was a huge controversy because
they handled the two guys running it.

635
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:11,370
We're making a million dollars a year 
and they were spending on lavish,

636
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,610
lavish conferences and stuff.

637
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,720
Is that true?
Yes.

638
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,070
It will make it a million dollars a 
year.

639
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:22,071
Yeah.
Both of them and now they're what you 

640
00:28:22,071 --> 00:28:23,961
want to talk about the wrong people to 
fuck over like that trained killers,

641
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:27,760
but to be fair,
come back from serving their country and

642
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,190
find out about this shit,
but to be fair to those guys,

643
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,890
but to be fair to the people running the
wounded warrior project,

644
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,060
human beings,
if you're working for a very big company

645
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:42,530
and you make.
I think they made over $300,

646
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:44,850
million dollars in donations in one 
year.

647
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:49,080
They had a huge endowment.
It's when you're working all day,

648
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:52,560
and I'm sure these guys are good people 
who are working probably 12 hours a day.

649
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,010
You're going to put a first class ticket
and it might be a red.

650
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,050
I got to sleep.
I,

651
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,260
you know,
I'm doing all this work.

652
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,030
I'm going to spend $500 as opposed to 
$300 and it just adds up.

653
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:08,030
And what happens is if you're doing a 
lot of work and you're really good at 

654
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,030
it,
they might say,

655
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,030
hey,
you're worth it.

656
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,840
We're going to give you a million 
dollars because the board votes that in.

657
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,570
So what I'm saying is that when you have
a,

658
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,270
when you have that much money,
before you give them a free pass,

659
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,680
we should probably know how they got to 
that.

660
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:21,681
Number three.
What I'm saying is anytime you have a 

661
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:22,320
lot of money,
it's going to be spent and people,

662
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,440
and there's not enough accountability.
Human beings are going to behave in a 

663
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,440
way.
Well,

664
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,020
they just,
yeah,

665
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,270
it's anonymous.
You're getting more money.

666
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:34,000
We're all doing the good job here.
We deserve something.

667
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,980
The biggest illusion is that people with
money are happier.

668
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,590
It might be the biggest illusion that 
exists in the world today

669
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,530
because everybody really wants to be 
happy,

670
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:49,770
but we really want to figure out how to 
get happy and the one thing that we 

671
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,350
can't figure out how to do is pay the 
bills.

672
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,670
So we're like,
fuck,

673
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:53,680
if I could just pay my bills,
I'd be happy.

674
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,890
Like that is like one of the prevailing 
illusions.

675
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:02,310
Well there's a certain point where you 
make enough money where the bills are 

676
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,190
taken care of and that which you're 
going to be happy not stressed out about

677
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,700
how long the answer to everything.
Yeah.

678
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:11,701
It's not the answer to.
It certainly makes you happier to not 

679
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:15,121
have to pay your bills,
but how many people do we know that are 

680
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:17,791
like super successful?
Multimillionaires out of their fucking 

681
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:18,160
mind?
Miserable.

682
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,020
The rich people I know are the most 
miserable.

683
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,040
When I think I did a little inventory on
like the Times that I think about what 

684
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,120
that brings a smile on my face at the 
Times that I remember being the happiest

685
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,750
gay stuff.

686
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,840
Almost always when I'm in a behind a 
dumpster with a strong guy,

687
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:34,540
very dark with the capital area guys are
black,

688
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,820
black,
black,

689
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:38,730
and very tall.
Hairy guys.

690
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,580
It's even better.
I don't think I've ever seen a black 

691
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:44,580
carry with me.
Yeah,

692
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,710
I've seen like it's their chest.
Hair is like more of like curly,

693
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,050
like Taco meat.
Whether hey man,

694
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,880
how is that racist?
Some Mexican food.

695
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:59,881
It's okay.
It go to black and Harry said chicken 

696
00:30:59,881 --> 00:30:59,881
meat.
That was in trouble.

697
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:04,240
That's a problem.
You can't say check and even know 

698
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,240
chicken's delicious.
Super Diligent.

699
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,020
But can you say Thai chicken?
If it's Tycho can you say black people 

700
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,070
might like Thai chicken or you will you 
get in trouble?

701
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,090
I don't know.
Subject right.

702
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,620
As soon.
As soon as you toss watermelon.

703
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,420
There were all.
Fuck.

704
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,530
Hey Man,
I love watermelon.

705
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,270
That's a delicious fruit.
You shouldn't bring it up.

706
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,090
It's really dangerous.
It is delicious.

707
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,810
Icing back to me and black eyes.
I've never seen a black guy happy.

708
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,240
I've definitely seen Harry Potter for.
Yeah.

709
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,010
Um,
but it's less common.

710
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Well,
not like Russian dudes like that dude 

711
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,160
that center in Abu Dhabi.
Do you know that guy?

712
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,140
That is z and Eddie Bravo.
Uh,

713
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,860
the Eddie Bravo Open.
Is that then the new Ebr,

714
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:39,940
the one that's in April.
Was that who?

715
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:43,140
That a crazy giant fucking Russian dude 
is those Russians.

716
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,780
Grocer or lost his ship?
Faded his shoulders.

717
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,580
He had to.
It was a nice blend.

718
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:49,990
I remember when I was fighting about the
winds was like,

719
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,280
oh shit.
I like the shade.

720
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:56,281
You got it on the shoulders.
It was like a one to two guard on the 

721
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:56,281
shoulders.
Just like a faith.

722
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,150
Yeah.
He's,

723
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,660
he's,
yeah,

724
00:31:58,661 --> 00:31:59,440
he's a Harry.
Fuck.

725
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,540
He was really young too.
Before he didn't.

726
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,580
Before he took care of us.

727
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,840
Chest goes the hairiest motherfucker and
all of MMA.

728
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,060
Dave Herman.
You ever see Dave Herman?

729
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,590
Herman crew.
That shit out of his beard was.

730
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:13,570
No,
I'm talking about his whole body.

731
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,590
No,
dude.

732
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,290
Dude.
Dave Herman is a fucking sasquatch.

733
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,940
Bring them by the way.
He's in trouble right now,

734
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:19,910
man.
I was going to say,

735
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,330
still do nuts.
He's nuts.

736
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,950
Here's a video that day released of him 
getting fucked up by cops,

737
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:27,970
man.
Oh Man.

738
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:32,971
Yeah.
It was like one of those things where 

739
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:32,971
the cop told him to get back in the car 
and he's like,

740
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:33,450
why do I get back in the car?
The car I told you to get back.

741
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,500
It's one of those things where like,
there was an unnecessary altercation 

742
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,020
between a person and he goes,
come exact fucking

743
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,510
him up.
And he's a giant,

744
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,710
you know,
very tall.

745
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,530
Herman's the.
I was in a back with him in a corner,

746
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,980
literally maybe hit Mitts for two 
minutes and then these planet Gameboy 

747
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,180
like old school tetris game,
but it's like two years ago they go,

748
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,320
Dave,
you're up.

749
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,940
Because now they go,
yeah,

750
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,120
puts it down.
Just rolls out there and fights.

751
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,090
It was August and we fought Gonzaga.
Uh,

752
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:03,390
I think so man in one round.
Oh Shit.

753
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,020
That's what he looks kind of good body.
Good.

754
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,120
Look into shredded set of tits on.
Okay.

755
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,540
I've got some tits.
Here's a talented fuck too,

756
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,250
man.
He just,

757
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,410
for whatever reason,
it was never disciplined.

758
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,090
Yeah,
I didn't totally put it together.

759
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:16,010
We had that same trainer,
the same striking coach,

760
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:17,840
and he was saying like when he'd be 
like,

761
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:19,220
dude,
you gotta come in and train,

762
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:22,220
and he just read that motherfucker is 
such a beast man.

763
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,890
So yeah,
my dad,

764
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,570
my dad makes that guy looked like a 
girl.

765
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,990
We're that guy.
That guy would slap your dad's kind of 

766
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,540
quiet after I talk about my dad,
he was probably smash it down.

767
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,850
I hate to say it now.
You don't know bro?

768
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,150
Most likely.
You don't know.

769
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,340
It's so much before you got to use.
He was like 20 and one just smashed 

770
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,250
pitches in Japan.
Some good names to really good names.

771
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,220
Who did he beat?
Oh Man.

772
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:54,250
The Dave Herman days.
Um,

773
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,900
once he did get to the UFC,
he had that crazy bout with the Abu 

774
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,160
Dhabi champion.
Remember that really big guy?

775
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,600
Miller?
A huge dude.

776
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,250
Not Fabiano schermer no.
Who was it really big?

777
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,410
Yeah.
And he's struggling with Netherlands.

778
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,330
Oh yes,
yes,

779
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:11,960
yes,
yes,

780
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:13,940
yes.
Fuck dammit.

781
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,360
I suppose five to.
It's the only fight I've ever turned 

782
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,360
down.
I remember that dude.

783
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,160
What the Hell's his name?
Didn't that guy beat Fabricio for doom?

784
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,180
Yes.
To manage.

785
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,650
So you were married?
Huge.

786
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,500
Yeah.
Pull up a Dave Herman's,

787
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,980
him and him and Dave had a fight of the 
night here.

788
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:31,280
He has 500 night serious John Oliver.
I know.

789
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,320
That's how I remembered it before I saw 
him.

790
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,670
Bam.
Yeah.

791
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:39,671
John Oliver.
Dynamo is a serious fucking Jujitsu 

792
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:40,340
phenom,
but for whatever reason it didn't really

793
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:45,341
pan out in MMA is fucking huge.
And he was also a lot older by the time 

794
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:47,040
he got the click on John Oliver Dynamos.
Um,

795
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,020
yeah.
And it was like,

796
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:53,140
right about the time they were like 
testing for real last to Mike Russell.

797
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,540
Last uh,
Dave Herman that beat James Thompson.

798
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

799
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,990
He's,
when I saw him though,

800
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:05,050
he was 30 because when I saw him was in 
2003 in Brazil.

801
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,190
So I guess he was in his twenties at the
time.

802
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,350
He was a beast.
He was Iraqi people,

803
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,560
but it was also confusing for everybody 
because he came out of nowhere because 

804
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:14,560
this guy was,
you know,

805
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,760
it was a European guy and all of a 
sudden he's a,

806
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,550
he's beaten Brazilians.
He's beaten a lot of like top top guys.

807
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:25,090
He was like right around the time when 
Gunnar Nelson was reckoned people to 

808
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:25,620
know about gunner.
That was the.

809
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:27,950
That's the only fight I've ever turned 
down my UFC career ever.

810
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:32,150
It was after I lost some Nogueira I 
wanted another big fight and like months

811
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:35,070
went by and they offered me him.
I knew him from Jujitsu,

812
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,420
but I had no idea about them from mma.
I like get the fuck Outta here.

813
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,960
And then Joseph was like,
oh yeah,

814
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,280
cool.
Here's Ben Rothwell.

815
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,660
Alright,
let's do that.

816
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,910
Wow.
Advisors managers.

817
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,030
I came in.
Yeah,

818
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:48,720
let's do that.

819
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,590
You should call that guy up in the 
middle of the night.

820
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,510
He man or that Rothwell fight the.
Let me take you.

821
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,180
Hey Bro,
thanks for that man.

822
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,050
Give me some time to adjust.
I know,

823
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,480
right?
That's not the game I'm in.

824
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,130
So what kind of tattoo are you talking 
about when you hit 10 million?

825
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,780
It's going to get that panther down your
neck,

826
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,970
getting something on your neck.
Maybe like a kiss.

827
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,110
Yes.
Ellipse like a lip kiss would.

828
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:17,310
That'd be sick.
Like a realistic one that I liked that.

829
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,370
I liked that.
Tat that tentacles and now you're 

830
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:22,370
talking nonsense.
Yeah.

831
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,450
You get that.
That's going to be aired.

832
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,310
Towers.
That's 45th.

833
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,640
Yeah.
That's many days.

834
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,820
Five or six days and you have to take 
time out like that.

835
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:34,821
That's a Kenyan mine.
You get your wife to kiss you on the 

836
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:34,821
next one.
Hundred percent.

837
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:34,821
No to that.

838
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,890
How about if you get one right above 
your bean bag?

839
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Been fucking been right above it.
I hold my Dick.

840
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,330
I want it.
I write up about my home,

841
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,470
my dick up and you just tattoo and 
understanding people.

842
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,630
People do get their dicks.
They do get their dicks to tests.

843
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,870
They do.
I've been thinking about doing it.

844
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,030
No fuck off.
I want to make it sparkly.

845
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:03,470
Does it doesn't sparkle enough.
If you were going to get your Dick 

846
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:03,470
Tattooed,
what would you do?

847
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,030
Little barnacles.
Barnacles or warts?

848
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,160
Elephant is around the and make it 
black.

849
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,630
Of course their sleeve it out and dark 
ink.

850
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,070
If you could possibly be.
Yeah.

851
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:20,150
Has any guy ever like done that?
Because I know guys get their entire 

852
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,150
forums black.
Have you ever seen that?

853
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,830
Like white guys will just really weird.
It's really weird.

854
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:27,831
Like they have one color,
one color tattoo and I always wondered 

855
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:28,020
if that's a cover up.

856
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,100
Like they maybe had some shitty tattoos.
I always knew it as a cover up.

857
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,040
Like it was a real bad tattoo,
like maybe a girl or something.

858
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,200
So then they just blacked it all out 
because you can't cover it up.

859
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,170
There was a famous dude who had that in 
a band.

860
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,520
What band was that?
Tim?

861
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,520
Rage against the machine.
Yes,

862
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,430
that's right.
That dude,

863
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:49,431
his whole arms was like all black.
A lot of times don't like recovering 

864
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:52,760
addicts get like the black band and they
do how many years and then just go black

865
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,220
all the way up to your ankles.
Do I want something on my back?

866
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,970
Like right at the top of my back and 
have your shockers.

867
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,960
Oh yeah.
Look at this dude.

868
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,330
I want something over my route that 
looks bad ass.

869
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:09,900
That's very odd.
You take for to kids.

870
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,130
Who is that guy?

871
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,410
He's from rage shoe.
That looks pretty sweet.

872
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,140
Name Jamie.
Tim.

873
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,160
Tim,
see it doesn't have a name.

874
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,800
That's a bad ass.
Yeah,

875
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,960
I like those.
What are those things that's from like 

876
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,230
some Japanese symbol about the tadpoles,
tadpoles in the middle.

877
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,240
Is that come?
They'll come on.

878
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,230
It's called Com.
I wouldn't get that common a tornado.

879
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,240
I have to shave my chest in my arms,
but that's what happens when you come 

880
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,240
into a garbage disposal and you hit the 
button.

881
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,300
It's like a symbol of it.
Hey man,

882
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,650
he looks sweet.
I'm not mad at that at all.

883
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,710
It might be the best one I've seen.
Now they all don't look like that.

884
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,190
Didn't go too deep.
He went like a half sleeve,

885
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,800
like down to the bottom of his bicep.
It's pretty cool.

886
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,920
She's always wearing armor.

887
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,970
Maybe I'll get to six shooters on my 
hips.

888
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:02,971
Your don't do.
They just get one tucked in your lower 

889
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:04,750
back pointing towards your asshole,
but just an arrow.

890
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Fun starts here.
Who are these people to get guns like 

891
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,230
fighters do near their porn stars?
Porn.

892
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,640
Dad's pointing down towards their best 
tattoos in the game as far as.

893
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,530
Well,
excuse me sir.

894
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:22,531
Your cheeks are tatted.
This man needs to hit the gym 

895
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:22,531
occasionally.
Yeah.

896
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:25,741
I don't like his body.
Can have the dad bod and get all those 

897
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:25,741
things.
If you're going to work on a tattoo,

898
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:26,530
if you're going to,
your body's going to be sleeved out like

899
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:31,531
that's not even a dad bod.
That's a good luck getting a woman to 

900
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:31,531
fuck you so you can become a dad bod.
Yeah.

901
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:34,120
It's a Vegan body.
Sorry everybody to.

902
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,690
How dare you.
I dare you started.

903
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,720
I'm going to get a bunch of pictures of 
vegans who are shredded.

904
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:39,520
They're going to be very angry.
You Dude.

905
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:42,100
You know the girl who has the sexiest 
test to me.

906
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,620
Christy mack.
She's got some good ones.

907
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,340
Can I see?
She saw this spot just so bad.

908
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,250
She was in here with war machine before 
war machine was out.

909
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,800
Before I tried to kill her.
I listened to some care.

910
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,510
She came here with them.
Yeah.

911
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,580
She took a nap on the couch.
Dead.

912
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,080
Gorgeous.
And person's very pretty,

913
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,340
very pretty.
She's tiny.

914
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,870
She's a tiny girl,
which is what like,

915
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,820
you know,
you hear all the shit that he did to her

916
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,910
and it's horrific.
If it was just a chick,

917
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,700
he's afraid for life.
Right?

918
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,940
He's gone,
he's gone.

919
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,020
But when you see her in real life,
she's so tiny.

920
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,840
You can imagine.
Pretty impersonal has beautiful.

921
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,840
You just can't imagine that a guy like 
her with no hair.

922
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:27,870
Look at that picture.
I liked the reason why I like look at 

923
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:31,390
that picture below.
Wherever the fuck out of the hospital.

924
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,860
Oh Hell No.
I'm talking about clarify though.

925
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:37,200
People are listed on the side,
bro.

926
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,260
That's the one.
That's the.

927
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:43,261
Yes one beat up one.
I'm not trying to see if he kicked the 

928
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:44,380
shit out.
She got away.

929
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,420
Yeah.
He was going to get a knife and she 

930
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,430
escaped.
She's the hottest chick in the game for 

931
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:52,430
sure.
Well,

932
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:52,650
she's definitely one of them porno 
games.

933
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,120
She's very pretty.
But my point is like,

934
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,520
I can't imagine.
She's like a little kid.

935
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,380
She always took a 100 pounds.
Really?

936
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:01,330
She's small.
She's tiny man.

937
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,690
She's fucking tiny.
I mean she might weigh 1:10.

938
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,430
Damn.
So she's super tiny,

939
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,680
so war machine,
I mean really fucked her up.

940
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,820
Yeah.
I mean I'm,

941
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:12,940
I'm not that good at numbers,
but she ain't a big girl.

942
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:14,560
She's like five slash one.
Maybe.

943
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,280
She's tiny.
She's,

944
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,700
you know,
the idea that he beat the fuck out of 

945
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:21,700
her like that.
It's just so crazy.

946
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,860
I listen to some of that podcast and he 
sounded like there's something about 

947
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,660
guys ducked real fast like that.
You know what I'm saying?

948
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:26,520
Yeah.
So for me,

949
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,230
you know,
it's like a firefighter.

950
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,980
You got to realize,
was he nervous?

951
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,480
I was that.
Oh,

952
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,710
I'm sure you know,
he's on the podcast.

953
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:34,310
He knows a million people are going to 
hear it.

954
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,740
I never think of that.
I never think of that.

955
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:40,610
But for some people that's a big.
These also did a lot of stuff.

956
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,560
Yeah,
he's on steroids for sure.

957
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,060
A lot of this stuff,
a lot of stuff.

958
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:49,090
Had a lot of head trauma with some 
serious demons with fighters,

959
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,640
some fighters that there is that 
adderall,

960
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:56,750
like a energy guys have been fighting 
for a long time,

961
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,830
but that's from head trauma.

962
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,770
That's what it feels like.
You got erratic behavior.

963
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,080
Breathing is a little bit erratic 
sometimes,

964
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:05,660
so they don't have.
They can't keep it together very long,

965
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,670
but they can't keep it together.
If something's boring,

966
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:09,300
they can't keep it together as something
is.

967
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,940
If something gets annoying to them,
they don't have a good way of like 

968
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,050
staying calm a lot.
A lot of them too.

969
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,920
A lot of them,
I'm one of them,

970
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:22,610
but a lot of them on our podcast or you 
know,

971
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,640
personal conversations,
the jump all over the board,

972
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,480
like they will never finish a story and 
come back around to jump all over.

973
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,970
Well,
when you know war machine,

974
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,400
he watched his dad die,
right?

975
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:37,160
Wasn't that one.
Was super dark demons.

976
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:42,270
Some tough.
He got arrested when he was really 

977
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,251
fucking young.
Cops beat the fuck out of him when he 

978
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:45,251
was like a teenager for nothing.

979
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:46,760
He tells a story and I,
I,

980
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,670
I tend to believe him,
man.

981
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,240
I tend.
I think that he's definitely made some 

982
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,240
fucking horrible choices in life,
no doubt.

983
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,500
But I also think he got fucked life 
fucked him.

984
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,350
He got a rough life,
fucked him early enough cards,

985
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,950
fucked him,
and he was around a bunch of other 

986
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,471
people that also got fucked and it's 
real hard to discern how to what 

987
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:11,600
direction to go through in your life.
I mean,

988
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:16,601
there's been a gang of people like that 
have gone in and out through the UFC 

989
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:16,601
that just did,
don't know.

990
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:21,400
They've been surrounded with shitheads 
and psychos and fucking criminals their 

991
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:23,750
whole life.
They don't know peace in normal,

992
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,760
so that's all.
They still can't try and kill a bitch 

993
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,060
though.
You know what he did was horrific,

994
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,360
horrific.
That that's also a breakdown of an 

995
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:34,360
ability to cope at all.

996
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,590
It sounds like he had bouts of madness,
you know?

997
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,610
Well,
he came home.

998
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:40,160
He came over to her house.
He wasn't supposed to be there.

999
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,440
They were separated though.
He wasn't supposed to be there.

1000
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:44,070
He came over to her house and she was 
with a guy.

1001
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,550
She's a porn star.
Well,

1002
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:51,580
she's hot too,
and guys want to fuck her if he's not 

1003
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:51,580
fucking.
Or someone's gonna wanna fuck her.

1004
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,300
Yeah.
You look at a slide in the dms because 

1005
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,300
you come over,
you have to be real sad.

1006
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,770
Your ass in front of the girl too,
I don't think.

1007
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:58,880
Yeah,
I don't think he would've been running.

1008
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,390
I would have been bad situation.
He had a knife then I'm like,

1009
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,780
get her boy.
He probably would've had a knife too.

1010
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:08,120
He's well,
he apparently it was a total surprise.

1011
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,410
He didn't expect the guy to beat and he 
just saw red and freaked the fuck out.

1012
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,720
He's fucking nuts.
He's fucking crazy.

1013
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,070
He's nuts.
He's always been nuts,

1014
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:21,071
but he's always been like super cool and
super friendly to me and I mean I was,

1015
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,980
I knew he had gotten into crazy fights 
with a bunch of porn stars and beat the 

1016
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,440
fuck out of someone in a bunch of 
people,

1017
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:29,240
like three or four people at some porn 
party.

1018
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,740
Some dude.
But to its off,

1019
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:33,990
they see the wrong shit.
They fuck up.

1020
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,100
No,
there's no repercussions.

1021
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:38,170
They can come across a guy like that.
He's going to fuck your world up anyway.

1022
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,910
We can be my friend though.
No,

1023
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,580
he can't get anybody but he can't be my 
friend.

1024
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,650
He can't be anybody who's terrible.
Let's talk about it.

1025
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:52,050
But he can't be anybody's friend.
He's in jail forever,

1026
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:57,080
you know,
but he's gonna make friends in there 

1027
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,080
though.
The point being like there's,

1028
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,450
there's certain guys that will just 
always fuck up.

1029
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,340
It seems well,
but they also,

1030
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,630
it's self sabotage,
right?

1031
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:07,710
Like this shitty hand of cards in life 
and they play this victim game.

1032
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,140
It's like I don't deserve any success.
So they look kind of.

1033
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,880
Dave and I were talking about this.
I called Joe because I wanted to lend 

1034
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,590
somebody money and I just want to 
sometimes like I,

1035
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I think I have a lot of guilt because 
like if you think about how some people 

1036
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,420
grow up,
they just never even had a chance.

1037
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,210
It was just a math fell in my favorite.
Didn't fall in there.

1038
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:29,310
I had parents that loved me,
I had stability.

1039
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:34,311
Some people had the exact opposite and 
then we were talking to like guy I 

1040
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:35,970
wanted to help and it's just a disaster 
and I'm like,

1041
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:37,380
I want to give him money.
I want to help them,

1042
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:40,530
but you get a sense that this guy was 
talking about.

1043
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,790
He's always going to be that way.
Brands going to be broke.

1044
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,510
He's always going to be,
fuck,

1045
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,930
I've loaned people money.
I know.

1046
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,720
You know how many people pay me back on 
to zero?

1047
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,410
The thing is,
did you tell me this?

1048
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:54,960
Did you tell me this?
I've been lending people money.

1049
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,300
If you lend someone money,
give it.

1050
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,910
Don't expect to just give it to.
I tell them,

1051
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,150
my father said that I've given it to 
people.

1052
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,650
Both.
You gave me that advice.

1053
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,770
I've got good friends that had been in a
financial crunch and I gave him money.

1054
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,490
If it's a legit friend and I know it's 
or it's a family member,

1055
00:46:08,491 --> 00:46:10,530
I know it's going to help them out.
Fucking tape.

1056
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,590
I was too hard.
I was fired for a reason,

1057
00:46:12,591 --> 00:46:15,540
so just take it takes time to figure 
that out though.

1058
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:20,541
Like when I didn't have any money most 
of my life and then all sudden when I 

1059
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:21,030
started having money and someone needed 
money,

1060
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,220
I looked at them as like how I used to 
be.

1061
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:23,640
I'm like,
well,

1062
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:25,050
if I help this guy out,
he'll,

1063
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:26,790
he'll get back on his feet and they'll 
take care of it,

1064
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,140
but they,
none of them did.

1065
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:29,910
Not only that,
they start avoiding you.

1066
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,990
Yeah.
Which is really weird.

1067
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,760
Hey Mike.
Um,

1068
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:38,250
uh,
you were supposed to pay me after three 

1069
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:38,630
months and it's now six months present.
It's,

1070
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:43,830
it's the old saying,
if you were the fastest way to lose a 

1071
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:43,830
friend is lending money because,
you know,

1072
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,440
I've kind of gotten what was owed me 
money for so long that I just don't even

1073
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:49,090
bring it up anymore.
And they'll call me up and he'll like,

1074
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:52,410
it felt good and every time we talk 
we'll give me the same song and dance.

1075
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:57,411
But he's about to pay me back and duties
owed me money for years when he's not 

1076
00:46:57,411 --> 00:47:01,060
really acquaintances now,
but that,

1077
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:01,890
that sealed it.

1078
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:02,760
It's also,
it's a,

1079
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,480
it's a mindset,
you know,

1080
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,230
a lot of times my experience with that 
is that yes,

1081
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:11,280
some people say there are plenty of 
stories of people who needed money badly

1082
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:13,110
and they made good and they paid it 
back.

1083
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:13,800
Yes.
But,

1084
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:15,660
but most of the time,
for the most part,

1085
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,930
the people that I'm talking about,
like you just know,

1086
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:18,690
they like,
man,

1087
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:20,610
you're always from one crisis to 
another.

1088
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,170
Fuck,
are you doing it?

1089
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:24,870
Doesn't matter the money.
Like I my last fight,

1090
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:30,050
I signed this deal with this company and
I'm going to call them out close friend 

1091
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,300
who did the deal and never saw the money
and he's a real.

1092
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,400
I've known this guy for average super 
close friend man and not a financially 

1093
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:37,930
I'm fine.
I'm doing better than I've ever done.

1094
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:39,190
Thank God.
And I,

1095
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,600
we always had this rift.
He wasn't texting me or calling me back 

1096
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,250
and I just called him one day from a 
random number and I said,

1097
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:46,240
hey man,
it's me.

1098
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,720
Fuck the money man.
Your friendship means more than me.

1099
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,640
I don't care if I ever get that money,
but let's just move on man.

1100
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,590
We're good now.
We're good.

1101
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,530
But he's always going to have that 
problem knowing that he ripped you off.

1102
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,630
That's fine.
I'm cool with that.

1103
00:47:58,690 --> 00:47:59,890
You are.
But he's probably,

1104
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:03,770
it's probably makes him feel that,
but at least I know where we're good and

1105
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,960
we have open relationship.
Well,

1106
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:06,280
that's nice.
It was very nice of,

1107
00:48:06,281 --> 00:48:07,170
you know what I mean?
Um,

1108
00:48:07,171 --> 00:48:08,260
I,
I told this dude,

1109
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,800
I mean like six months in,
I was annoyed that I didn't get paid 

1110
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,080
back.
But then I stopped,

1111
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:14,940
you know,
I'm this,

1112
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,010
this was one guy.
I mean I could go back over to the Times

1113
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:23,011
that I've been here and it's,
the problem is everybody's got this 

1114
00:48:23,011 --> 00:48:23,011
scam.
Everybody's got this scheme,

1115
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,760
you know,
they want to come to you and if you just

1116
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:29,761
gave me this money,
I'm going to start this business and 

1117
00:48:29,761 --> 00:48:29,761
that business can make so much money.

1118
00:48:29,761 --> 00:48:33,720
And then as soon as my buddy gets in,
he's gonna bring his cousin who has a 

1119
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:33,720
connection and we're going to start 
this.

1120
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,230
I know,
I know that because how many people lent

1121
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,740
you money to get to where you're at now?
Did you ask me?

1122
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,160
Neither know dove and I'll tell you who 
it was after we're off the air.

1123
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:46,990
But Shit,
fuck,

1124
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:47,880
I know.
But devin,

1125
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,230
I bought a guest comedian a car.
Um,

1126
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,180
we,
we loved this young guy,

1127
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,990
this young comedian and both of us,
Jay Leno now,

1128
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,440
we loved them,
we loved them.

1129
00:48:56,441 --> 00:49:01,441
We thought he was amazing bathroom and 
we liked him so much and I was bothered 

1130
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:05,641
that how,
how he had no money and he was so smart 

1131
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:06,250
and such a good guy and I was just like,
this is bugging me.

1132
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:11,251
And he's taken the bus down to San Diego
and you take the bus around La and he's 

1133
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:11,251
got no way.

1134
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:11,950
You can't live in La.
You can't be a comment,

1135
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:14,080
can be living on the bus.
It's going to kill you at the end of the

1136
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:14,980
day.
So I said,

1137
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:15,700
I go,
you know what man,

1138
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:17,380
I got some money and I said to,
I go,

1139
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:21,040
let's buy this guy car.
I got a friend who deals in good cars.

1140
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:26,070
They're not expensive.
Let's get them a reliable fucking Honda 

1141
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,791
or something.
How much you can spend four grand for 

1142
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:30,520
me.
We both spent two or something.

1143
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:32,500
It was not a big deal.
Meanwhile,

1144
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,660
long story short,
just bought it for him.

1145
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:35,380
Call me.
Thank you.

1146
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:37,330
Thank you.
All this stuff always brings it up.

1147
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,370
He sold it.
When I see him.

1148
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:39,370
No,
he made it.

1149
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,980
He made it in the business.
He crushed it.

1150
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:42,970
Yeah.
Real estate.

1151
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,440
What had happened?
He never paid you back.

1152
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:45,310
He never.
He,

1153
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:45,790
I,
he.

1154
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:47,710
I said to him,
this is not a loan.

1155
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,310
This is what we want to give you and I 
will never take money back.

1156
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:52,960
This is I am.
Because he didn't want to take it.

1157
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:53,650
He's like,
what are you doing?

1158
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:58,651
I go,
this is my gift to you because you're 

1159
00:49:58,651 --> 00:49:58,651
worth it and does it the same way as his
name.

1160
00:49:58,651 --> 00:50:00,760
Ron with.
I want to tell your story.

1161
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:02,580
Why wouldn't you tell him?
Tell you.

1162
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,270
Yeah.
You don't want him to.

1163
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,360
To write it down though.
That he was a broke ass bitch at one 

1164
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,360
point.
Well,

1165
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,360
he,
he,

1166
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,480
we all have our.
Let me see what you've never heard of 

1167
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:15,480
them.

1168
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,260
Never fucking heard of them.
Gave Chris rock a car.

1169
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,030
Yeah,
I'd support that choice.

1170
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,530
The choice that you just made.
Of course,

1171
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,780
once.
You see what I mean?

1172
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,240
I knew right away I knew right away.
I was,

1173
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,840
I understand why you didn't say the 
name.

1174
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,190
Yeah,
no need poor.

1175
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,320
Do you have wonderful community?
I don't mind helping anyone else.

1176
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,080
A lot of fighters to man.
Listen,

1177
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:40,190
I get the struggle of the game.
So anytime they help with tee shirts,

1178
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,810
whether they're trying to podcasting 
what are.

1179
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,450
I got one guy,
Jack May's,

1180
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,480
hate to say his name,
but my,

1181
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,040
my boy,
he's trying to get a fight on tight man.

1182
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:53,041
He's been doing it forever and my old 
manager and super close friend likes 

1183
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:53,990
Mcmahon owns tighten when he fight for 
living,

1184
00:50:53,991 --> 00:50:55,790
man,
this guy's a bcs kids.

1185
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,360
So I'm constantly hitting up pine almost
as his fucking manager,

1186
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:03,290
like get this guy a fight man,
because they keep dragging on.

1187
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,850
Then someone falls out and he's texting 
me like,

1188
00:51:05,851 --> 00:51:06,950
dude,
I don't know what to do.

1189
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,340
So it,
it.

1190
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:13,570
It's tough man,
because you want to help them but help 

1191
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,330
them different ways than giving them 
money.

1192
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,370
That's the way he is worth the effort.
Some people are with you every,

1193
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,380
like even some people,
like if somebody asked me for money and 

1194
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:21,740
I feel like they are really needed and 
they're,

1195
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,030
you know,
I,

1196
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:27,710
it's almost worth the money to see them 
not be in pain.

1197
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,930
Like I'll buy that for my own peace of 
mind.

1198
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,670
Not a hard fast rule,
you know,

1199
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,290
like exactly like most things in under 
most situations.

1200
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,800
When people need money or they come to 
you to borrow money,

1201
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,870
they're not going to fucking make it.
It's just,

1202
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,940
it's not going to happen.
No.

1203
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:46,040
If they're reaching out to you from God,
but most of those guys,

1204
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,750
they're looking for a shortcut.

1205
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,850
Yes.
Most of this,

1206
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:53,870
this part of the personality of someone 
who keeps coming to people asking for 

1207
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,921
money.
It's like it's so common that it's the 

1208
00:51:56,921 --> 00:51:59,951
same kind of guy.
It's like this God that has this 

1209
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:03,131
elaborate story that he tells you that 
involves some new thing that's going to 

1210
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:04,640
happen and when that new thing happens,
it's going to take.

1211
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,720
I wish I could record them.
I wish I could record the rules there.

1212
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:11,120
I met with a guy the other day who's a 
buddy who I am.

1213
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,200
I'm also in business with.
We're meeting on the idea of this 

1214
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,920
merchandise thing and he pitches this 
whole marijuana idea.

1215
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:19,460
To me,
I'm like,

1216
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:24,400
what the fuck is wrong with you man?
Like a business whole business where I'm

1217
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,040
like,
dude,

1218
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:28,040
get out of here man.
Just focus on this.

1219
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,820
Cornered me at the fucking store one 
night about some marijuana business he's

1220
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:35,120
doing and wants me to get involved and 
they'll give me equity and the dude,

1221
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:35,960
I'm not doing anything.

1222
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,280
I have people call me all the time about
you pitching me ideas for you.

1223
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,540
They're just like,
I got this great idea.

1224
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:45,230
I got to speak to Joe Rogan and person.
I know my friend,

1225
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:47,810
but it's just not going to happen.
I could see it all going bad.

1226
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,240
I could see it.
I mean immediately you talk this guy,

1227
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:55,260
the guy,
first of all the guy super aggressive 

1228
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:55,260
coming up to you,
wants to go into business with you.

1229
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,000
It doesn't even know you wanted to go 
into business,

1230
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:58,400
to your first sign of craziness and then
you know,

1231
00:52:58,401 --> 00:52:59,890
once,
once it all goes about,

1232
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:04,910
dude,
I fucking made this business been if it 

1233
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:05,330
wasn't for fucking Mahmoud and have this
pit and you're like,

1234
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:07,160
I didn't even want to be a part of this.
Why am I here?

1235
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:09,110
I got to get out of here and the next 
thing you know,

1236
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:10,460
you get this crazy dude.
He hates you.

1237
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,030
Nothing worse.
Yeah,

1238
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:17,040
I mean the people that need your help or
need your money in that bad of a way 

1239
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,070
where they go out of their way to get in
your face about it.

1240
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,880
They're looking for like a way to 
shortcut the system.

1241
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,960
Like the system of making it as a 
comedian.

1242
00:53:25,961 --> 00:53:26,050
The

1243
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:31,050
system.
Like how many guys have come up to you 

1244
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:31,050
and go,
hey man,

1245
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:31,050
you don't be fucking really cool if you 
could take me on the road.

1246
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,430
Like what?
Like dude,

1247
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:36,180
you don't get spots anywhere.
I can't take you on the road.

1248
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:38,220
You're,
you're not putting in the proper hustle.

1249
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,440
And did you ever do that?
Joe Rogan?

1250
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,540
Do you ever do that?
Yes.

1251
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,180
There's a reason why his ass is asking,
you know,

1252
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,810
because I knew there's no short cuts in 
man.

1253
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:47,930
There's ways to do it.
I,

1254
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,340
I'm friends with all the door guys,
the comedy store,

1255
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,210
and these motherfuckers,
they put on their instagram pages.

1256
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,010
They're constantly hitting open mic mess
constantly.

1257
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:02,070
There'll be relentless.
You've got to be writing and always 

1258
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:02,070
performing.
Speaking of performing,

1259
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,710
we're going to be in denver,
March 18th and 19th.

1260
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,200
It's my birthday too.
What's happening?

1261
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,640
Oh,
I'm glad you asked Joe Rogan.

1262
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,100
Um,
we're gonna be doing a live show.

1263
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,360
Brendan Schaub,
Brian,

1264
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:14,490
count fighter.
And the kid March 18th,

1265
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:19,491
two shows at comedy works south 19th,
two shows comedy works in Denver.

1266
00:54:20,221 --> 00:54:21,190
Performing.
I love it.

1267
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,200
This.
It's one of my favorite parts of your 

1268
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:26,200
birthday,
dude.

1269
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:26,200
It's my birthday.
Buy Your tickets now.

1270
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,921
Where do they go for tickets?
He fat k Dot k dot this bitch out 

1271
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:35,211
Denver.
Denver's one of my favorite places on 

1272
00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:35,211
the planet earth.
Has one of my favorite places.

1273
00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:39,371
Did I?
That's where my wife is from and I 

1274
00:54:39,371 --> 00:54:39,371
always moved back there.
So you want to move down together,

1275
00:54:39,371 --> 00:54:43,851
we'll fucking move that.
You could live 20 minutes from the city 

1276
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:46,050
and be in the mountains and have a 
fucking insane house with a view.

1277
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,850
Here's the process.
Drive down to Denver.

1278
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:49,200
Comedy works.
Absolutely not.

1279
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,080
It was the only problem if you to leave 
and be pissed now to my wife.

1280
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:55,830
My wife grew up in snowshoe.
I'll never move back.

1281
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:57,630
Exactly.
Fuck that.

1282
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,100
Snow.
People don't like the snow.

1283
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,640
I like it.
I like visiting Dev,

1284
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,860
track animals when we go in soon.
Oh,

1285
00:55:03,861 --> 00:55:05,280
we'll talk after the police.
Yeah,

1286
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,400
we're good.
We're going to um,

1287
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,380
the thing got moved to August.
That's important for media.

1288
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,480
Frank Castillo.
He's one of the guys who works at the 

1289
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:14,730
store and this fucking kid is funny as 
shit.

1290
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,220
And he's hustling.
He puts up his,

1291
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:20,120
like his instagram posts.
If you look at frank custody,

1292
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,980
I think it's just frank Castillo on,
on instagram.

1293
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,940
But if his,
uh,

1294
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:28,970
his instagram posts.
So it's constantly post all the 

1295
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:28,970
different open mics.
You have to be.

1296
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:30,190
There's too much competition.
Cameron doing.

1297
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:35,250
He's the one open mic night they dealt.
Do Open mic nights that are outside on 

1298
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:35,350
someone's roof.
They do them everywhere.

1299
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,010
Doesn't matter what you do,
it's how you have to do it.

1300
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,670
It doesn't matter.
It's an audience.

1301
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,610
It doesn't matter.
I have this friend who was breaking into

1302
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:46,611
comedy,
but this person has a a large online 

1303
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:50,271
social media following already and then 
break it into standup and we had a 

1304
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:54,201
conversation about it and they don't 
want to do the open a girl by not saying

1305
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:56,900
he or she.
They're thinking the two good foot.

1306
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,220
Well they don't want.
They don't want to do that hard,

1307
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,450
that hard work that they should know.
They should also know it's all the same.

1308
00:56:03,451 --> 00:56:04,140
Well,
not only that.

1309
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:09,141
How about the fact that you were.
I will do that grind and Brian and I 

1310
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:11,460
will go to open mic nights.
Well to this day will show up at an open

1311
00:56:11,461 --> 00:56:12,630
mic night.
Well,

1312
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,250
we've pumped.
Fucking plan it out.

1313
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,290
Yep.
You know.

1314
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,410
Well,
I'll do spots.

1315
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:20,190
I do the fucking when red band has an 
ice house spot at 10:00

1316
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:21,810
at night and then there's like 30 people
in there.

1317
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,850
I'll fucking show.
Well,

1318
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,010
I'll,
I'll text him

1319
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,300
up.
What's up man?

1320
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,200
Because you right,
sometimes you come up with ideas,

1321
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,280
fossil,
you're passionate.

1322
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:29,740
I said,
hey,

1323
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:34,741
we need to start doing that.
I'm going to start doing a lot more of 

1324
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:34,741
that local stuff.
I'd like to.

1325
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:37,240
How about the hot cafe?
That's fucking great.

1326
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,170
Sometimes when I'm doing the um,
the ice house,

1327
00:56:40,171 --> 00:56:42,010
like the main room,
Jan will have a show,

1328
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:47,011
the booker level,
a little show in the little room over 

1329
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:47,011
there and again at 30,
40 fucking people that,

1330
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,020
that room only holds 80,
you know?

1331
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:54,060
So if you got like,
and sometimes like red bag gets like 80 

1332
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:58,140
stuffed in there sometimes and it is a 
killer fucking crowd just are on top of 

1333
00:56:58,391 --> 00:57:01,210
you man.
There's like 80 people in that room with

1334
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:02,740
you guys.
That's amazing little room,

1335
00:57:02,741 --> 00:57:03,100
right?
Yeah,

1336
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,000
I'd have it.
How was it?

1337
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:04,680
How worried is it?

1338
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,550
When we started doing our live shows,
I didn't know.

1339
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,420
Brian was like,
dude,

1340
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,230
I think we're in Portland,
Seattle,

1341
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,060
100 people,
eight,

1342
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,460
900 people.
And I was nervous.

1343
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,760
I'm like,
yeah,

1344
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:13,420
whatever.
It Brian's like,

1345
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:14,980
dude,
you don't realize like,

1346
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:18,070
this is crazy man getting theater.
He's like,

1347
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,530
he just jumping in,
can you do,

1348
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:25,990
but listen,
there's no one way to do it and what 

1349
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,430
you're doing is different because you're
doing that show.

1350
00:57:27,431 --> 00:57:30,430
Like you guys were essentially doing 
like a dramatic piece.

1351
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,190
Yeah.
Yes.

1352
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,320
A lot of ad libbing and fucking around.
But you have a show.

1353
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:38,070
You've been like Tom Seger and his wife 
Christina Presensky.

1354
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:43,080
They have your mom's house.
They take that on the road and it's 

1355
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,690
Kinda the same sort of thing.
They have an online like podcasts,

1356
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,740
but then they have a real live show,
like an extended brand.

1357
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,350
Yeah,
yeah,

1358
00:57:48,351 --> 00:57:48,730
yeah,
yeah.

1359
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:51,400
And it becomes fun.
Shit they do.

1360
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,480
Yeah.
That's,

1361
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,250
I mean that's just the greatest time of 
my life,

1362
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,660
man.
Pivot to what you want to do.

1363
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:57,290
Stand up on your own.
Like just.

1364
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:58,930
Yeah,
like don't put it.

1365
00:57:58,931 --> 00:57:59,830
You're doing it right.
Yeah.

1366
00:57:59,831 --> 00:58:01,840
We kick the show off.
I do like the first 10,

1367
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:04,390
15 minutes.
So I absolutely love it man.

1368
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:09,420
So do you think you'll start like 
expanding and like putting together an 

1369
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:09,640
act and maybe even touring?
Yeah,

1370
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:11,380
I think so too.
Would you could that.

1371
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:16,560
You could totally do.
I think you can do it in the hardest to 

1372
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,020
a show with the three of us.
How about that fucking come on son.

1373
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:22,450
Fun.
That would be a Brent and get ready to 

1374
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,590
sell at 3,500
people because it broke and starts doing

1375
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:27,670
it.
That's what it means about that $5,000.

1376
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,370
Oh my God.
I'm more happy now.

1377
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:35,370
I'm working.
I get more satisfaction when there's 

1378
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:35,370
those live crowds.
That's why I put them on instagram.

1379
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:39,030
So I'm so happy because it's hard to 
explain because in the UFC if,

1380
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,120
if you have a fight,
right.

1381
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,370
And I've never been the main event.
I've been combing events,

1382
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:47,371
I've been in big fights,
but the crowd's not there just to see 

1383
00:58:47,371 --> 00:58:47,380
you.
They're there to see all fighters.

1384
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,360
Right.
But at a fire and a kid,

1385
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:50,380
whether it's 800,
900 people,

1386
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:55,381
he sold out shows.
They're really there to see Brian and 

1387
00:58:55,381 --> 00:58:55,381
Brendan.
So the love I get from that,

1388
00:58:55,381 --> 00:58:56,360
do I have,
I've been seeking it,

1389
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:00,670
looking for it my entire life,
my entire life for this approval.

1390
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:05,671
You know what I'm saying?
For this fucking approval my entire 

1391
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:06,040
life.
It's hard for me not to cry,

1392
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,120
man.
When I get done with them,

1393
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:09,830
it's hard for me to repeat too.

1394
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,740
That's Irvine,
right?

1395
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:12,700
You guys do in Irvine.
Yeah.

1396
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:15,130
Everybody tomorrow night.
I think there's tickets left.

1397
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,230
That's a fat room.
I can't wait man.

1398
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:18,030
I get.
It's like the.

1399
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:20,290
It's like superbowl Sunday for me,
man.

1400
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,280
It's fun.
Insane.

1401
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,690
Now you get it.
I get it.

1402
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:29,970
They don't have.
Thank God brain trauma hasn't kicked in 

1403
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:29,970
where I can still fuck dude.
Alpha.

1404
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,040
Brain the fuck out of yourself on a 
daily.

1405
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:36,041
Eventually they're going to have stem 
cells and shoot it in there and you're 

1406
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:36,041
going to be a super brainiac.
Hopefully.

1407
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:36,770
Man.
You don't want to get too smart though,

1408
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:41,771
because if you get too smart you,
you'll consider the repercussions of 

1409
00:59:41,771 --> 00:59:42,630
saying what you're about to say.
I know right now I'm just like,

1410
00:59:42,631 --> 00:59:47,631
that fucking dog just go insane stuff.
I keep a certain amount of stupid on 

1411
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:50,260
hand just for.
I really do do.

1412
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:55,320
Huh?
There's a certain amount of like if I 

1413
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,420
wanted to really go fucking sot nom 
namaz day and fucking meditate all day.

1414
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,550
The problem is I could kind of go there 
to.

1415
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,530
Those guys aren't funny though.
Are they?

1416
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,020
Well,
it's not the kind of funny I do.

1417
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:07,450
I mean people get bruised up fresh.
I kind of comedy people get bruised up.

1418
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,460
The thing is if people,
if they don't have a opinion on what 

1419
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,250
you're doing one way or the other,
you're not doing shit son.

1420
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:18,310
Well I like,
you either want people that you want 

1421
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:18,310
more people to like you and hate you,
but you need both.

1422
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:19,070
That's what I like.
We released podcasts.

1423
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,950
I get all these hateful things and good 
thing like,

1424
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,280
perfect ma'am.
We're doing good.

1425
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:27,340
I know what I like.
I know the kind of comedy that I like 

1426
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:27,340
and that's the kind of comedy that I 
like to do.

1427
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,490
Like I don't like.
I don't like calm comedy and chaos.

1428
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:34,040
Like I like,
I like watching people have fun.

1429
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:34,750
Yep.
You know?

1430
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:37,220
And that's,
there's only a couple ways to do that.

1431
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:42,221
And there it's always the subject 
matters are always going to be 

1432
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:42,221
controversial.
Like,

1433
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:46,990
like I always say,
Joey Dee is my favorite all time comic 

1434
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:46,990
because he's a 100 percent 
controversial.

1435
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:49,380
His take on everything is always going 
to be controversial.

1436
01:00:49,381 --> 01:00:54,381
It's always going to be.
That's why you go to a show because you 

1437
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:54,381
don't want to hear what the average,
you know,

1438
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:57,980
you want to see outrageous shit man.
Well he's a rock and roll comic.

1439
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Yes.
You know you're watching some fucking 

1440
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,000
rock and roll.
You Watch it.

1441
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,260
Some chaos.
That's what I want the best.

1442
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:09,820
That's why when someone has an opinion,
like that's why I don't watch these 

1443
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,581
shows,
whether it's nfl or UFC where I know 

1444
01:01:12,581 --> 01:01:12,581
who's paying their bills.

1445
01:01:12,581 --> 01:01:15,530
So they don't give a real opinion like,
no bitch tell it like it is.

1446
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:17,630
That's why they wouldn't let you on UFC 
tonight.

1447
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,740
That's why 100 percent they got rid of.
And what,

1448
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,070
why they got rid of.
Because also my,

1449
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:27,130
I'm so sick,
I'm doing so well my own shit with 

1450
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:27,200
finding the kid and these live tours.
When they,

1451
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:32,230
they wanted me to drive to Burbank to 
film the show and do all this stuff 

1452
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,230
like,
you have to pay me this much,

1453
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,330
man,
this is what I'm worth.

1454
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:33,170
Now.
They're like,

1455
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,520
well,
we can get this dude for this.

1456
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:35,320
I'm like,
that.

1457
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:38,180
Good luck getting that,
do that.

1458
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,160
Well,
you understand your value.

1459
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:45,490
You know?
I think that is one thing where if I 

1460
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:49,301
could give the UFC advice,
what's one thing that I would say is 

1461
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:51,180
turn guys loose to turn guys lose.
Why don't beat themselves.

1462
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,810
What makes the UFC special?
Because you're looking at baseball.

1463
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,960
It's on a downward trend because they 
have all these rules and guys can't be 

1464
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,081
themselves.
We have so many personalities and to 

1465
01:02:02,081 --> 01:02:02,081
become a fucking cage fighter and you 
underwear,

1466
01:02:02,081 --> 01:02:06,400
you got to be pretty fucking crazy.
So you get these cool colorful 

1467
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:06,400
personalities.
We want that man.

1468
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,470
Let that fucking go.
You remember?

1469
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:13,320
Do you remember when Matt Brown got in 
trouble for talking about like Rhonda?

1470
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,160
I'm not watching list.
The women are naked.

1471
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,820
Just some redneck shit.
Fucking

1472
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,530
savage.
He,

1473
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,120
he had,
uh,

1474
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,340
he did a video the other day on 
instagram of him with his kid on his lap

1475
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,240
and his kids like,
what you like being cute and you know,

1476
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:34,550
little little tiny baby and he's like,
it's hard being hard fucking savages 

1477
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,480
hold onto to a baby in between dead 
lifts and punching people in the Dick 

1478
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,030
fucking baby dude.
Does he have a fight coming up?

1479
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,960
I'm like,
yes,

1480
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:55,070
he was supposed to be scheduled,
but why do I think he pulled out or 

1481
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:58,080
something or the FYC I canceled.
Wasn't he supposed to be fighting?

1482
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,210
Why do I think he was supposed to be 
fighting Damien Maia?

1483
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,010
Because he's the last guy to beat 
wonderboy.

1484
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,640
Yeah,
it was like four or five years ago 

1485
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:07,640
though.
What is map Brown's put.

1486
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,950
See if we could find that.
I feel like there was a great fight that

1487
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:13,920
was coming up that was super excited for
it and it got canceled.

1488
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,670
Do you have any interest coupon whether 
Mcgregor's fight Aldo next.

1489
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:23,210
I think there's going to be frank.
I think you fight Frankie Edgar's away 

1490
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:25,970
easier sell the Aldo fight.
Aldo comes back and wins and wins in 

1491
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:30,681
spectacular fashion,
like say if Aldo in cups wants and have 

1492
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:34,221
a rematch because cub swanson,
although went the same way that Frankie 

1493
01:03:34,221 --> 01:03:37,540
Mcgregor when although jumps out them 
hit some of the flying knee two seconds 

1494
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,560
into the fight and cracks him.
You can't sell Aldo Mcgregor too.

1495
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:43,350
You can sell frankie just like you.
Why not?

1496
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:47,070
Because all he's got to win again.
If he wins again,

1497
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:49,830
see the differences.
You could sell it,

1498
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:55,170
right?
You wouldn't sell it for as much as if 

1499
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:55,170
although one.
Okay.

1500
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:55,170
Damien Maia.
Yeah.

1501
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:55,400
It was right,
right.

1502
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,430
UFC One 98.

1503
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,850
That's in Brazil.
That's overdue.

1504
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,210
I'm steep in meal check.
We'll be doing a fight companion because

1505
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,970
Joseph will be here.
Fuck,

1506
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,170
that is the weekend of my daughter's 
birthday.

1507
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:15,171
So I can't go.
Go back to go back to what you were 

1508
01:04:15,171 --> 01:04:15,570
saying about Mcgregor and Aldo.
Oh.

1509
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,590
So although would have to,
he would have to,

1510
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,170
I mean redeemed them.
So we'd have to be some.

1511
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:27,470
Something you could sell.
That's like when manny Pacquiao got 

1512
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:28,110
knocked dead.
The floyd may where the fight was off,

1513
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,410
but then he beats Chris Algieri.
Yeah,

1514
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:33,510
it looks like a fucking demon again.
It starts looking fantastic and go,

1515
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:35,070
okay,
we can see it.

1516
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:37,380
We can see it again.
And then they sold the fight.

1517
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:41,910
But if they tried to go right from the 
Juan Manwell Marquez knockout right into

1518
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:42,630
fort.
Maybe with the fight.

1519
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:45,880
Fuck that shit.
That fighter as to when Joe,

1520
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,160
that.

1521
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:49,920
That's why like for,
for Misha,

1522
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,280
I want Michelle Holly to.
Do you want me show Rhonda?

1523
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,640
Really use it for a third time.
Yup.

1524
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,010
Yup.
I do.

1525
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,460
I think Misha has a mission.
It's better now.

1526
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:00,980
It'd be interesting to see.
I,

1527
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,610
I,
I do that,

1528
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,330
but she's the champ.
Me.

1529
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:09,340
She's the fucking champ now.
I think that's because she's lost her 

1530
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:10,740
Rhonda twice already and didn't really 
come close to being there.

1531
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,140
She so she could lose to Amanda Nunez.
Amanda Newman.

1532
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:18,141
I know.
That's why I can't toss them in a Nunez 

1533
01:05:18,141 --> 01:05:21,441
in there right now because there's only 
three bitches who can fight right now 

1534
01:05:21,441 --> 01:05:21,441
that we're going to pay to see.
Really.

1535
01:05:21,441 --> 01:05:22,900
So you have Meesha,
holly,

1536
01:05:22,901 --> 01:05:23,530
Rhonda,
right?

1537
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:28,790
Rhonda,
probably till November is what they're 

1538
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:28,790
saying.
So basically eight months just because a

1539
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:29,560
movies.
Who knows.

1540
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,630
I bet.
I bet you heard he's her ass back up now

1541
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:32,740
that Mitch has champ,
right?

1542
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,750
I don't know man,
because who knows man.

1543
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,340
So let's say one chooses to fight 
differently and not engage her and fight

1544
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:40,510
the way she fought.
Holly.

1545
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,420
She fights holly and fight smart and 
measured bro.

1546
01:05:43,421 --> 01:05:46,810
She was getting her ass whupped against 
holly until she pulled that out.

1547
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:52,230
She was definitely losing shuffling,
getting whooped though I wouldn't say 

1548
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:55,660
she's her face was well taken care of at
the nfl stuff face especially with 35 

1549
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:59,410
pound girl and she never got rocked.
Her knees never buckled.

1550
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:04,411
She never like looked like she was going
down as down three to one until she was 

1551
01:06:04,411 --> 01:06:06,700
definitely down in points,
but nothing holly was doing was carrie.

1552
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:12,240
She was.
Holly was fighting real smart and she 

1553
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,341
was moving and can completely control 
the control of the standup at Michigan 

1554
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:18,010
to win this and I was talking to Brian 
during the fire went and it's like,

1555
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:23,500
man,
she's always second best because she's 

1556
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:23,500
champ.

1557
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:23,500
She's a great champion.
She looks good.

1558
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,820
She talks good.
She represents good for.

1559
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,830
For Women in the UFC.
I would say all those things.

1560
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:27,700
Great.
Yes.

1561
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:28,420
Yeah.
She's.

1562
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,870
She's a champion.
She's a really nice person.

1563
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,320
She's great and she's a.
So it's holiday show.

1564
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:36,840
Yeah,
she is.

1565
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:40,330
That's what you want.
Especially that ass from the house.

1566
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:43,270
Respect Brian Caraway.
That's a.

1567
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,960
that's.
I was talking about this on the podcast.

1568
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,010
I think that nobody talks about that.
That's a real love story.

1569
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:50,410
That's an American love story.
Brian Caraway,

1570
01:06:50,411 --> 01:06:54,190
so in her corner and he gets very 
romantic.

1571
01:06:54,191 --> 01:06:56,460
I think that's a very.
I do.

1572
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,610
I'm going to cry.
Let it relax a little bit,

1573
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,570
but you won't shut the fuck up.
Nobody gives.

1574
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:03,580
Nobody talks about it.
I do.

1575
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:08,670
I almost cried again.
I almost cried again was when I was 

1576
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:08,670
interviewing me.
Yeah,

1577
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:10,060
because she finally did it when she 
said,

1578
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:11,140
when I said,
how's that sound?

1579
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:16,140
She goes,
I've been waiting to hear you say those 

1580
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:16,140
words for.
So she was going to retire.

1581
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,770
How about she was like,
they're not getting my shot.

1582
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:19,750
I'm going to be the fuck.
I was thinking about it.

1583
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:21,310
You know what she's thinking,
what she's doing with her life.

1584
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:23,800
She has,
if,

1585
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,080
if let's say,
run it for whatever.

1586
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:28,030
You can't fight til November.
So that's what,

1587
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:29,260
eight months,
right?

1588
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,660
Yeah.
Why not do Holly Meesha to.

1589
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:32,650
Well,
you certainly could.

1590
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,780
I mean that was the only other fight you
can do,

1591
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:38,560
but the problem with that fight,
his mom's not really a problem with that

1592
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:40,570
fight.
What's the worst that happens?

1593
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:41,800
Holly Wins.
Then you have holly,

1594
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:43,060
Rhonda,
that we want to see.

1595
01:07:43,061 --> 01:07:44,840
Really?
That's the biggest blockbuster.

1596
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,860
Finding the history,
but I.

1597
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,970
Because you've lost that.
You definitely,

1598
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:52,030
but I would like to see it.
The problem is the timeframe,

1599
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:54,730
but I would like to see Ronda versus 
Meesha,

1600
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:56,740
but what if me,
she wants to sit it out,

1601
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:57,370
would have me.

1602
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:02,370
She wants to wait for Ronda and she was 
trained like a fucking demon for h is 

1603
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,840
what holly should have done and they 
should have just been on this pr fucking

1604
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:09,870
tour to build her celebrity up so high.
So by the time her and Rhonda fight is 

1605
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:14,041
the biggest fight in UFC history,
I'm going to get Dan on the phone and 

1606
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:14,041
have him hire you.
Well,

1607
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:18,570
you know,
you know what the agreed with that he 

1608
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:20,300
wanted.
That's what Dana was saying was he had a

1609
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:21,960
blast out.
People think I don't like Dana.

1610
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:22,970
I'd like Dana,
man.

1611
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:24,830
We just disagree on certain things.
Who gives a fuck?

1612
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:25,380
Well,
but I,

1613
01:08:25,381 --> 01:08:26,690
I when I say,
because Dana goes,

1614
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,310
yeah,
she should have waited,

1615
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:33,311
but we had a meeting with her manager 
choosing me in on the meeting and they 

1616
01:08:33,311 --> 01:08:33,410
wanted to hurry up and fight,
which I think was a mistake.

1617
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:35,300
He's 100 percent correct.
Well,

1618
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:38,930
100 percent correct financially,
but you gotta respect her as a warrior.

1619
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:44,150
What she wanted to do,
Joel wanted to get in there and people 

1620
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:46,230
in a throw down.
People argue that on the title that you 

1621
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:49,450
had been a better fighter fuel.
You're an armchair quarterback when 

1622
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:49,880
you're talking about Monday morning,
the day of the fight.

1623
01:08:49,881 --> 01:08:54,170
She could have one and if she did one,
she would look like even pros and cons.

1624
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:55,790
I mean,
I'm talking about when people say,

1625
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:57,200
ah,
but such a warrior.

1626
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:02,350
Listen,
being a warrior doesn't pay the fucking 

1627
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:02,350
bills 20 years from now.
That's true,

1628
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:03,230
but you gotta understand she made a fuck
load of money for that.

1629
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,290
She will wait.
She would have made so much more fucking

1630
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:07,720
money.
I would say she's gonna have.

1631
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,120
She's gonna have a shot at Rhonda.
It's going to have holly,

1632
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,500
I think holly,
but who knows how many.

1633
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,630
This is the risk and the risk and MMA 
is.

1634
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:18,500
Look when Connor,
if Carter loses to Frankie Edgar,

1635
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:21,570
which is a possibility.
It's a scary fighter.

1636
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,280
Conor.
Very,

1637
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:27,550
very strong and so it's so in a way,
if he loses to nate,

1638
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:31,040
now we lose it to Frankie.
That luster.

1639
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:33,650
That time is gone and it's,
it's.

1640
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:36,640
And that's one of the things.
He still has an email right now.

1641
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:40,250
He still that because he lost a fucking 
savage at one system.

1642
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,090
That's a biggie.
Edgar is a 48 hour storm.

1643
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:47,480
You better have everything.
Chad Mendez the fuck.

1644
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:49,760
He said 48 hours.
Can I get tired?

1645
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:51,670
Never.
He's not getting tired and he's going to

1646
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:56,780
wrestle his ass and he's gonna.
Come at you crazy angles.

1647
01:09:56,781 --> 01:09:58,310
His footwork is.
Since this is the problem.

1648
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,780
This is smaller.
The problem though,

1649
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:02,180
if connor connects,
which friend he does get hit.

1650
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:02,930
Yeah.

1651
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:09,520
You think in La Conner.
I mean frankie could get knocked out of 

1652
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:11,920
Connecticut at 1:45
cutter.

1653
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:12,810
Well,
starch.

1654
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:16,490
Anybody,
anybody be so heavy head by the way.

1655
01:10:16,491 --> 01:10:19,250
So we'll cub Swanson and cub Swanson 
couldn't connect on forgotten.

1656
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:24,260
Birthed in me.
Frankie just wolverine dim just for 

1657
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:24,920
whatever.
It's very,

1658
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:30,750
very possible deviled them.
First of all the know condoms got to 

1659
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,541
suck a lot of weights,
very hard soccer him and it's a five 

1660
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:37,751
round fight and man,
if anybody can grind you into the 

1661
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:37,751
ground,
it's,

1662
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:38,600
it's that guy and you're at the Chad 
Mendez fight.

1663
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,640
Obviously Connor had a knee injury going
into that fight,

1664
01:10:40,641 --> 01:10:42,850
but Chad took him down at will,
you know,

1665
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,200
and that'll be when frankie gets you 
tired.

1666
01:10:45,201 --> 01:10:50,201
Man,
he's gonna get in trouble when he did 

1667
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:50,201
two cups,
one cub.

1668
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:52,900
Swanson rather was incredible.
I mean he just wore him.

1669
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:53,800
Never seen an ass whooping.

1670
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:58,810
Like really?
It's getting cub cub as far I've seen 

1671
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:01,631
everyone in the gym club is the most 
talented guy if ever seen in the jail 

1672
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:04,280
watches tennis gave or fight insane how 
talented that kid is.

1673
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,840
So when I saw frankie just dismantling 
with whole wheat,

1674
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:09,770
Frankie Edgar,
his,

1675
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:10,970
like you said,
his footwork,

1676
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:12,560
he's,
he's his boxing's great.

1677
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:13,470
Hard to hit.
You know,

1678
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:15,720
whether or not probably,
and I don't know the numbers,

1679
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:18,120
but I would assume I don't think he's a 
drawl,

1680
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,750
but if snob.
But if you give them a car,

1681
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:22,770
you're good because he's a fucking 
drawer.

1682
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,460
So what I'm asking is that if you're 
connor's manager and if you're connor,

1683
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:31,730
doesn't it make sense to somehow duck 
frankie in the interim fight Aldo for 

1684
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:33,330
the big money,
easy fight,

1685
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:37,320
but all you see you go.
Unless although winds,

1686
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:42,321
I'm telling you how you're going to sell
all that when he starts them at 16 

1687
01:11:42,321 --> 01:11:45,651
because he was a champion for 10 years 
and also that starching with happen so 

1688
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:45,651
quickly.

1689
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:49,790
People go,
I'm in shit because I want to know if 

1690
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:51,651
that was a fluke.
That's why I'm interested a little bit 

1691
01:11:51,651 --> 01:11:51,651
run out,
but Brian,

1692
01:11:51,651 --> 01:11:51,651
you could sell it.
You could sell it,

1693
01:11:51,651 --> 01:11:54,150
but you're not going to sell it for 
nearly as much as you would sell it.

1694
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:57,810
If all the wind something.
I've got to fight all the fights.

1695
01:11:57,811 --> 01:12:02,811
Max Holloway.
How about what have you tried some Max 

1696
01:12:02,811 --> 01:12:05,091
all the way and he fights fight so it 
looks like the Aldo of old or he gets 

1697
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:11,691
his ass whooped,
but one of those guys emerges and then 

1698
01:12:11,691 --> 01:12:14,541
you've got the possibility of Max 
Holloway having a rematch with connor 

1699
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:16,310
connor to a decision.
We need some young blood in Mexico,

1700
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:21,420
a fucking fucker mother.
Some young bloods only like 24,

1701
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:30,240
24 deep and Halloween was fighting.
He was fighting 55,

1702
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,490
always 45,
44,

1703
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:35,910
45 fucking free.
He's got a fight coming up though.

1704
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,210
Doesn't Max Holloway have a fight?
Aldo UFC 200.

1705
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:41,640
Make it happen.
Why do I feel like he's got a good fight

1706
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:44,160
scheduled like that I'm interested in.
Is He fighting llamas?

1707
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,240
You fight and Ricardo Lamas because 
llamas just fought.

1708
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:53,000
Diego Diego's only appearance at 45.
He was way too sucked up.

1709
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,740
But.
But it maxes on a total winning streak,

1710
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:56,670
isn't what?
What is he?

1711
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,860
How about Diego Sanchez beaten Jim 
Miller.

1712
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:02,730
He got dale season one season one 
winner.

1713
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:04,890
Only guys left,
right?

1714
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:06,660
Yeah,
but Diego is like,

1715
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:11,690
he's still in the hot mix.
That fucking kids an animal.

1716
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:13,750
All he knows.
One thing,

1717
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,540
fighting to take a Sanchez.
Watch his fight with Jake ellenberger.

1718
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,490
He said,
how about Martin Kampmann?

1719
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:25,491
That's the best one because for two 
rounds he's fucking face is hanging off 

1720
01:13:25,491 --> 01:13:26,610
of his head.
He's nuts and he's just.

1721
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:27,810
And he wins.
The third round,

1722
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:33,050
he went into the fucking third tire 
against the guy at camp men who fought 

1723
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:33,050
in [inaudible].

1724
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:36,220
80 five.
You know it was a small 85 as diego one 

1725
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,880
that sees amazing striker too,
but very good striking diego.

1726
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:39,930
One that goddamned third round puts his 
arms down and he goes,

1727
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:43,840
come on,
and they started fighting now.

1728
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,690
Now you've got them angry one the third 
round,

1729
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:47,560
but against Gilbert Melendez.
That's right.

1730
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:52,640
That was fucking scratch dude.
I was doing an analyst's work for espn 

1731
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:56,940
and all they want talk about jds and 
whoever was on the.

1732
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:58,950
I forget which one it was and I went,
fuck that.

1733
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:00,510
Just hear me out.
Fuck debt.

1734
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:02,870
Fight as a guy who knows fighting you 
have.

1735
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:07,230
You have to talk about Diego in Gilbert 
Melendez please.

1736
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:10,050
Finally they kind of showed it.
I'm like,

1737
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:11,830
I'm telling you guys are fucking 
dropping the ball.

1738
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:12,100
This

1739
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,980
is the fight.
That is one where I'd show my kid like,

1740
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:18,670
you want to see what findings about 
Insert Gilbert Diego hair.

1741
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:23,110
I'm like ESPN and shit together.
Fuck.

1742
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:25,510
I think it was a jds mark hundreds on 
that.

1743
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:30,511
I forget to get the fuck out of my face.
That's like some guys they want to fight

1744
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:33,190
like that,
but they can't find a willing opponent.

1745
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,740
But if you can get Diego and Gilbert 
together,

1746
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,790
kill it.
Like Gilbert.

1747
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:40,890
If you fought smart too,
probably out moved diego for sure.

1748
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:41,680
Let's try it.
But he,

1749
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:45,170
he decides in bags as they should put 
those guys.

1750
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,650
He's just every car.
Every two months.

1751
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:48,630
Those two fight.
Yeah.

1752
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,950
Go every two months.
Not going to step back.

1753
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:53,050
He's going to stand in a phone booth 
with you and just bang.

1754
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,610
Such a good guy.
Gilbert.

1755
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:56,430
He got.
He got popped for what?

1756
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:57,580
Yeah.

1757
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,320
Dammit.
I know that I got older.

1758
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,030
You get older.
You need a little help and I,

1759
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,400
I,
you know,

1760
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:08,401
I'm torn on this.
I swear to God I'm torn because I know 

1761
01:15:08,401 --> 01:15:08,650
she's shorter careers.
You gonna see more injuries,

1762
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:13,710
dad bod veto or bums me the fuck out to 
see that.

1763
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:23,690
Let me see it.
Bring it up to our TV tour is maybe my 

1764
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:27,460
all time favorite fighter watch now.
I like tic Toc.

1765
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:28,780
Overeem.
TRT over.

1766
01:15:28,781 --> 01:15:29,530
Okay.
You're right.

1767
01:15:29,531 --> 01:15:30,490
Because you were hurting.
Bitch.

1768
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:32,390
Trt over and heads off.
And j.

1769
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,540
what's your brock lesnar and that's hard
to top that.

1770
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:37,840
Maybe you want to retire the size 
factor.

1771
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:43,080
He's just so big and ridiculous.
He didn't look at it and doing world 

1772
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:43,080
class striking.
Yeah,

1773
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:43,860
but fucking Vittorio,
we'll kicked rockhold never throw.

1774
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:44,940
We'll kick it.
Hold Bro.

1775
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:49,370
Kicked Michael Bisping's eye on those 
little brown kids.

1776
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:54,660
We can't see his girl is fucking hot.
Well,

1777
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:57,400
that's.
It's hard to tell man.

1778
01:15:57,401 --> 01:15:58,960
That could be the shirt sticking out 
like that.

1779
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:00,850
He doesn't.
When he fought Chris Weidman,

1780
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:04,300
everyone was saying he's fat in that,
but that might just be the shirt and you

1781
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:06,460
can't really tell these certain 
pictures.

1782
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:11,461
You take agree.
I liked the fact that we put that 

1783
01:16:11,461 --> 01:16:11,461
online.
He doesn't give a fuck.

1784
01:16:11,461 --> 01:16:14,521
Look at my gut.
It was a show I just knocked out Dan 

1785
01:16:14,521 --> 01:16:14,521
Henderson and one round,
but first of all knocked out.

1786
01:16:14,521 --> 01:16:14,590
Done Hansen.
Look at my girl.

1787
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:16,350
I'm rubbing her shoulders.
Eat Dixon.

1788
01:16:16,351 --> 01:16:17,010
Yeah,
yeah,

1789
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:18,520
yeah.
I got a gut,

1790
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:21,060
but I'm fucking rich and Brazilian.
You know what I'm saying?

1791
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,840
He's a superstar.
He's a superstar in Brazil,

1792
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,590
but really it's like Tom Cruise over 
the.

1793
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,380
He got hit hardest by the reebok deal.
Dude.

1794
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,000
I saw.
I saw.

1795
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:35,530
I watched a documentary on Rinaldo,
the soccer player.

1796
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:37,720
That's who you want to be in your next 
life.

1797
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:41,950
That got really beat his ass.
I don't give a shit.

1798
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:43,180
He's the king of the world.
He's a prince.

1799
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:44,660
I would make out with them.
All right.

1800
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,600
Where's Vito Bell floors up there,
man?

1801
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:50,020
That guy's killing it.
How about t our TV tour man.

1802
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:54,910
CRTV tour back in the rockhold days and 
the little when he fought a bisping.

1803
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:59,940
Wouldn't you have liked to have seen 
what would happen if that guy fought 

1804
01:16:59,940 --> 01:16:59,940
Weidman?
I would've liked to have.

1805
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:01,950
I still beat him with his wrestling 
moves.

1806
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,520
Verse Luke rockhold.
Well,

1807
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,530
we already saw that once.
Yeah,

1808
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,060
he did kick his

1809
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:15,060
face off.
Kicked his face on talking about the 

1810
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:15,060
champion rankled.
Now those are back in the day.

1811
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:16,460
I'm talking now dude.
Crtv Torres.

1812
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,230
Barely human.
Okay.

1813
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:23,231
That's easy.
The aliens standing because here's the 

1814
01:17:23,231 --> 01:17:27,521
thing about Ti RTV tour.
You got this freak body with abundance 

1815
01:17:27,521 --> 01:17:30,590
of fast twitch muscle fibers.
Ridiculous work ethic.

1816
01:17:30,591 --> 01:17:32,030
See,
he's still in good shape.

1817
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,300
That was him throwing a punch there.
He's still.

1818
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:39,330
I don't know why he's thrown one punch 
and dropping his hands like that would 

1819
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,100
certainly be doorbell for.
Yeah,

1820
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:42,470
it's one punch knocks people out,
but it's weird like,

1821
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:47,740
why would you show this?
This is a weird thing to show because I 

1822
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:47,960
don't think he gives a fuck.
Yeah,

1823
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:49,850
I mean,
I guess that's the weirdest thing.

1824
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:52,020
I guess they're working on some moves or
something like that.

1825
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,720
Just moving around at the end of the 
workout.

1826
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:56,270
You compare that to go to the rockhold 
fight.

1827
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:58,100
Vetoer verses Luke rockhold.
By the way,

1828
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:03,250
we might've brought up TRT Vitorin when 
we get together about every time our 

1829
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,970
obsessed with him.
He was a psycho man.

1830
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:08,990
I need me for a loop and this just 
shouldn't my fucking world.

1831
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:14,410
Kimbo and Ken shamrock busted for that 
coming.

1832
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:16,010
I don't believe it.
That doesn't make any sense.

1833
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:18,260
Them by Lord lead him there.
He's a demon.

1834
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:23,300
Luke rockhold and is all natural.
They're like surfing and just a basic 

1835
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,110
ass haircut.
Rockhold looks like a school boy there.

1836
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,170
He's like,
what?

1837
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,780
His fucking face kicked off in Brazil.
Well,

1838
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:30,610
Roger told me 14 hours and get your face
kick though.

1839
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,500
He told me he saw him at the weigh ins.
He was like,

1840
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:36,650
what the fuck is this guy on?
He said,

1841
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:39,740
just you could tell just looking at it.
And then Vito whispered in his ear,

1842
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,300
afraid.

1843
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,290
Well,
his skin,

1844
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:44,270
he's also,
it's training.

1845
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:47,320
I mean it is not just the fact that he 
was on trt,

1846
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:52,330
which you most certainly was,
but also the fact that he was training 

1847
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:54,680
like a fucking monster.
That's him all sucked up though.

1848
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:58,520
That's at the winds when he's pointing 
to is Jesus Waste Bella band there?

1849
01:18:58,580 --> 01:18:59,090
Yeah,
for sure.

1850
01:18:59,091 --> 01:19:04,091
We see like above that Jesus throw that 
we'll kick you out like that's him when 

1851
01:19:04,091 --> 01:19:05,090
he will kicked rock holding the head.
Look,

1852
01:19:05,091 --> 01:19:07,460
look how big he is.
I mean Jesus Christ.

1853
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,160
So the reason why I think he's the 
scariest,

1854
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:14,090
he's because he's got a massive amount 
of experience.

1855
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:17,000
You're talking about the guy who has 
been fighting since 97.

1856
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,040
He's been training since,
you know,

1857
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:20,210
years before that.
Right.

1858
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:25,220
So he's been around for ever almost 20 
years in the game.

1859
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:29,420
He's in his ups and downs at the 
highest,

1860
01:19:29,421 --> 01:19:34,421
highest level,
at the highest level and he's only like 

1861
01:19:34,421 --> 01:19:34,421
38 now.

1862
01:19:34,421 --> 01:19:35,930
I think he just turned 38 if I get it 
correctly,

1863
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,630
which is crazy.
Such a nice guy.

1864
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:41,480
Very nice because like the Nice Guy,
very nice guy,

1865
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,490
v towards a smart guy too,
you know,

1866
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:45,940
and he speaks very fluent English as 
well as uh,

1867
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,170
as,
as uh,

1868
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,370
as well as a Brazilian Portuguese 
rather.

1869
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:54,550
But if you look at his body,
like what you have is this freak body 

1870
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:59,501
that also has all this knowledge.
And usually by the time a guy acquires 

1871
01:19:59,501 --> 01:20:00,380
all that knowledge,
his body starts to fall down.

1872
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,570
I had a conversation with Eve Edwards 
about it,

1873
01:20:02,571 --> 01:20:03,800
you know,
we were talking about like,

1874
01:20:03,801 --> 01:20:06,740
eve is super knowledgeable guy.
So many fights.

1875
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:08,130
He's had so many fights

1876
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,520
and it's almost like his,
he knows so much now,

1877
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:15,300
but his body just doesn't cooperate like
it did when he was young and wild.

1878
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:16,010
Bummer.
Yeah.

1879
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,540
Back in the Aaron Riley days,
ever seen his fights with Erin Wiley and

1880
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,470
hook and shoot.
Yep.

1881
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:24,860
And then you see a lot of guys who have 
resurgens we were talking about this 

1882
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:24,860
like heavy weights and stuff.
Who,

1883
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:25,380
you know,
like Ben Rothwell,

1884
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:27,510
guys like that.
Who victoire I mean,

1885
01:20:27,511 --> 01:20:28,000
uh,
um,

1886
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,040
fabrizio like,
you'll,

1887
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:30,930
you'll,
you'll see them when they get to be like

1888
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:32,250
in their thirties.
They,

1889
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:32,760
yeah,
our,

1890
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,190
they get into thirties and they're 
fighting differently.

1891
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,720
That's heavyweights though.
Yeah.

1892
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,840
Well wait until January,
have a longer career and later we'll 

1893
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,040
guys be thinking about coming back.
I think they genuinely don't know how to

1894
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:47,280
move their body as well when they're 
younger because there's so much mass.

1895
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,800
I think if you look at like little tiny 
people,

1896
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:54,950
like one of the things I've noticed 
about having kids is you want to like 

1897
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,460
kids in gymnastics class and the shit 
they can do with their body.

1898
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,730
It's not just like flexibility.
There's no wait,

1899
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:00,800
there's no mass.
So they're like,

1900
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,130
no,
even their body around,

1901
01:21:02,131 --> 01:21:07,131
they're rolling around,
they're doing flips and they develop 

1902
01:21:07,131 --> 01:21:10,490
like an understanding of.
It's also being able to measure like a 

1903
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:15,380
Chris Vineyard was explaining to me how 
though as you get better and better at 

1904
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:16,140
boxing,
you have to move less because you're.

1905
01:21:16,141 --> 01:21:21,141
I can measure shots,
so instead of like really moving to the 

1906
01:21:21,141 --> 01:21:25,251
side like a guy like that,
I'll just literally step back like an 

1907
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:28,401
inch gets you to miss and then boom,
we'll experience experience is 

1908
01:21:28,401 --> 01:21:31,461
priceless.
Men before I fought really Nelson tell 

1909
01:21:31,461 --> 01:21:31,461
me,
I was like,

1910
01:21:31,461 --> 01:21:31,680
dude,
I'm more athletic.

1911
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:32,220
Well,
and he goes,

1912
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:32,790
yeah,
but man,

1913
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:34,800
he has so much experience.
I'm telling you,

1914
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:35,970
it's priceless.
I was like,

1915
01:21:35,971 --> 01:21:37,270
yeah,
what the fuck does nate more current?

1916
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,730
No.
Build courts.

1917
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,360
A perfect example too.
Well,

1918
01:21:41,361 --> 01:21:42,030
no,
who the fuck?

1919
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,840
They just knock out CB doll baby doll 
and I was saying in that fight,

1920
01:21:44,841 --> 01:21:46,950
I'm like,
CB can open up and chase him.

1921
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:52,330
That's like,
you can't just open up because the last 

1922
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,861
thing to go on a guy like nate Marquardt
is and nate mark harking corral and he's

1923
01:21:56,251 --> 01:21:59,460
called racked a lot of guys.
He's got a lot of memories.

1924
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:05,260
It's just me and my muscle memory.
He went flying through the air,

1925
01:22:05,261 --> 01:22:08,590
like do that bullshit leg kicks.
He try to throw a knee out,

1926
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:13,591
let me try to lead.
I just caught them on the street school 

1927
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:14,610
named Mark Karp.
Fuck you was a bad ass.

1928
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:19,640
He was a guy that was super talented but
might've had like a little bit too much 

1929
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,930
damage by the time he got started 
fighting when he was 17 years.

1930
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:27,010
Yeah,
17 doing it and winning coming is 

1931
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:31,700
fucking highlight reel knockout of tyron
woodley and strikeforce is one of the 

1932
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:32,590
mortal Kombat on one of those.

1933
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,930
Asked al Combos.
Oh,

1934
01:22:33,931 --> 01:22:35,930
he's a monster.
So talented.

1935
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:40,940
Such a diverse and a lot of traditional 
martial arts techniques mixed with some 

1936
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:45,840
really good boxing as well.
Extensive martial arts background and 

1937
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:45,840
they started fighting.
He was very young.

1938
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,240
He was like the first like,
especially in Colorado,

1939
01:22:48,241 --> 01:22:50,600
man nate was the shit.
He's I what?

1940
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:53,180
I looked it up because the baddest went 
straight to his gym.

1941
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:55,620
You said you'd never seen him lose 
around in practice?

1942
01:22:55,621 --> 01:22:56,790
Not for a very,
very,

1943
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:57,870
very long time.
Yeah.

1944
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:03,230
Yeah.
It seems like our team is number one 

1945
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:03,230
training partner,
wasn't me.

1946
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:03,450
I mean,
yeah,

1947
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:05,470
he's crazy.
That whole connection,

1948
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:05,950
you're going to get

1949
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,620
better if you're.
If you're training partner is one of the

1950
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:11,020
greatest ever will use.
Although there's that,

1951
01:23:11,021 --> 01:23:12,880
but the word was always at nate was 
better.

1952
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:18,090
That's what I've heard.
Nate was a bigger guy and he was 

1953
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:18,200
fighting at one 85 last night.
One time I said,

1954
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:19,870
I said,
how do you do against GSP?

1955
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:22,480
And he said,
well that's all I said.

1956
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:23,280
He's so modest.
I go,

1957
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,660
what are you going to do?
He's not gonna.

1958
01:23:25,661 --> 01:23:30,330
Say anything.
Why would he say anything or underwear?

1959
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,970
There's nothing worse than when you 
asked the guy something.

1960
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,140
He fucking.
I'll do.

1961
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:39,180
I've,
I've fucked a whoever vidor Belfour up 

1962
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:39,390
in round one.
Practice them.

1963
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,200
I'm rack this.
Well,

1964
01:23:41,201 --> 01:23:44,240
there's a lot of guys don't have that.
Right to the worst practice.

1965
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,370
Yeah,
there's some good fights coming up,

1966
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:50,950
man.
This what you call Frank Mir.

1967
01:23:50,951 --> 01:23:51,910
Mark Hunt.
Yeah.

1968
01:23:51,911 --> 01:23:53,900
That's interesting.
Magni.

1969
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,920
Hector lumbar scares me for my buddy and
Hector Hector Lombard fan.

1970
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:01,810
He gets a hold of you.
You go for a ride.

1971
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:07,020
He's also a guy that's been a.
He tested positive and he's been around 

1972
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:09,220
a long another mindblowing one I know 
who saw that surprised.

1973
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:14,240
I'm like,
what would that ass that's artificially 

1974
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:14,240
created?
Let her ass.

1975
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,810
He I feel like is in the same boat as 
his other acumen.

1976
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:21,840
Cuban compile,
compatriot Yoel Romero in that they got 

1977
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:23,830
to the UFC a little late in their 
career.

1978
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:29,070
People Forget.
Hector lumbar was merck and everybody 

1979
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:29,750
over in Bella tour.
Everybody.

1980
01:24:29,751 --> 01:24:32,320
He came over from Bella tour like people
forgot.

1981
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:37,530
They forgot and bitches forgot he was 
ripping dude's face and I think he's 

1982
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,160
only five,
nine tiny.

1983
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:41,410
He the fight,
the fight that he might even be fight.

1984
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:42,340
Yeah,
he's 55,

1985
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:45,010
eight,
but the fight is him fighting.

1986
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:46,570
So I like how they do it in inches.
That's five.

1987
01:24:46,571 --> 01:24:46,990
Nine,
right?

1988
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:48,490
Yeah.
The fight.

1989
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:49,630
The fucking body.

1990
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:56,260
I've never seen it as no home.
I've never seen in my life.

1991
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:59,360
Then it's the best class I've ever seen.
He can explode on you,

1992
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:00,420
man.
He can explode them.

1993
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:02,110
Anyway,
so the way he knocked out nate,

1994
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:07,000
perfect example that knock on the nate 
Marquardt was fucking ferocious.

1995
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:12,480
The angles and the fearlessness in which
he chased nate down in the knockout 

1996
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:12,850
power.
When he's on me,

1997
01:25:12,851 --> 01:25:15,250
he's fucking terrifying it.
Good luck beating them when he's on.

1998
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,080
I want to see him fight Robbie law.
That's a fight.

1999
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:19,420
I want to say.
How old is hector now?

2000
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:22,060
Not Young,
but he's never taken a beating.

2001
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:24,270
Still rolls with that acne.
How about when he,

2002
01:25:24,271 --> 01:25:29,271
uh,
how about when he went in and fucking 

2003
01:25:29,271 --> 01:25:29,271
destroyed?
Paul Horace.

2004
01:25:29,271 --> 01:25:30,000
That's when you are 38.
Yeah,

2005
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:32,530
that's when you saw 30.
How fucking scary.

2006
01:25:32,531 --> 01:25:32,990
He is.
[inaudible].

2007
01:25:32,991 --> 01:25:35,410
It's called Harris,
like couldn't do shit to him.

2008
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:40,740
Hector Lombard before this drug tests 
and we don't know how he's going to be 

2009
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:40,740
now,
but scary.

2010
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:44,520
Scott won 70.
Who the fuck knows if you draw that 

2011
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:44,520
card?
You're like,

2012
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:44,520
ah,
fuck.

2013
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:49,810
That ain't smart.
It's not fun that any one where you're 

2014
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:49,810
like,
yeah,

2015
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:50,290
I can ask both.
He's in a different weight class.

2016
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:51,550
He just.
I mean that might be the picture,

2017
01:25:51,551 --> 01:25:53,890
but yeah.
Or maybe it's not the picture.

2018
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:57,700
No magnets long and tall though.
Here's a totally different guy.

2019
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,450
Dude.
Man.

2020
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:04,830
We did the companion.
Powerful Ellen job and fighting on this 

2021
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:04,830
card,
but how about when we did

2022
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:05,150
the,
what's her name?

2023
01:26:05,151 --> 01:26:10,151
Remy Nikai.
You remember that draws all into what 

2024
01:26:10,151 --> 01:26:12,080
might meet your date?
You know what the uh,

2025
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:15,020
what builds?
She?

2026
01:26:15,021 --> 01:26:18,460
Um,
she's cute.

2027
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:23,290
She just like weird fetish stuff.
Yeah,

2028
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:25,040
man.
I was into it when exactly.

2029
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:27,960
Sure what it is.
It's one of the proof.

2030
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:32,980
Either way.
It's one of the few times where I read 

2031
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,681
the captions.
I'm glad I don't speak Japanese market 

2032
01:26:35,681 --> 01:26:35,681
and suck.
Robin had a baby.

2033
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:38,660
She's got a cute face.
Fuck you.

2034
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,610
Don't try to cover this up.
And Leslie Smith,

2035
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:48,610
she had to get her ear sewed back on.
I Love Jessica Jessica.

2036
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:53,240
I blasted her ear and it shot up like a 
volcano and she wanted to keep going.

2037
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,310
Her fucking ear was hanging off her 
head.

2038
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:58,640
She had a hole that you could look deep 
into her skull kidded,

2039
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,530
man.
I'd never seen anything like it.

2040
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:01,340
Yes,
you want to keep going?

2041
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,020
They should want to keep going.
She was upset.

2042
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:06,530
She was sleeping.
Good luck.

2043
01:27:06,531 --> 01:27:08,020
Picking knockout of the night or 
performance night.

2044
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,740
There's gonna be so many knockouts on 
that card.

2045
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,490
I did the matchups.
Yeah,

2046
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,310
I think there's a better picture.
Jamie will.

2047
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,380
You can see there.
That's it.

2048
01:27:14,381 --> 01:27:16,100
You just had it right there.
Click on that one.

2049
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:17,470
Yeah.
You could see how,

2050
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:22,500
how deep the hole was.
It was a giant hole because the skin 

2051
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,750
gets so thin from the flower and that 
bitch opened up.

2052
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,010
What's not that?
It gets thin.

2053
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:27,680
Actually what it is,
the actual cauliflower itself,

2054
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:30,170
it,
it helps rip apart the skin because it's

2055
01:27:30,171 --> 01:27:33,770
like having a rock under your skin.
I see that one.

2056
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,260
You see that one too?
That's what it looked like.

2057
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:41,290
Oh my God.
You see into her fucking see your brain.

2058
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:43,670
So you.
Do you think while she had it sewed back

2059
01:27:43,671 --> 01:27:43,910
on?

2060
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:46,010
She got the colored flower trimmed off?
I would,

2061
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:48,740
I would to trim that shit.
Yeah.

2062
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:51,590
It's going to grow back if you keep 
training.

2063
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:54,230
Isn't she a Cesar Gracie?
I think.

2064
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:55,660
I think she's one of them.
Uh,

2065
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:00,760
Cesar Gracie nor cowgirls and fighting 
to do it for a living man.

2066
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,230
You gotTa love fighting.
She's tough as fuck.

2067
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,700
Really?
Picture man.

2068
01:28:04,701 --> 01:28:07,250
God dammit girl,
do your thing.

2069
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:11,300
She looks like an anime like doll.
I know she is paid to do that shit.

2070
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,510
They think about how fucking tough Josh 
Birkman is.

2071
01:28:13,511 --> 01:28:18,511
We're talking about Hector Lombard,
Josh Berkman who just fought his last 

2072
01:28:18,511 --> 01:28:21,461
fight and one at 55 veterans,
fought Lombard and locked it,

2073
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,830
sat in the car,
sat there in the pocket is sick.

2074
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,190
She went into that fight.
Antibiotics I fucked up.

2075
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:30,190
That's the fight that hector test 
positive for it.

2076
01:28:30,191 --> 01:28:30,680
Yeah.
That's the fight.

2077
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:35,690
Hector content and Berkman just sat 
there and just kinda parried and stayed 

2078
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:36,330
pretty much mark less.

2079
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,320
I just want to state dangerous.
That's why Lombard,

2080
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:42,410
especially when lumbar started to get a 
little tired.

2081
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:47,530
He didn't want to come in because bomb 
wing and bombs at you and he can.

2082
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:49,560
You could hit him with a bat.
Yeah.

2083
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,800
That motherfucker take a shot.
Well,

2084
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,960
he didn't take it too.
He's just tough.

2085
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:57,260
Berchmans been around and he's fought as
heavy as to.

2086
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,730
Oh really?
Yeah.

2087
01:28:58,731 --> 01:29:01,260
He fought Jeremy Horn once and I don't 
know what the fuck.

2088
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:06,290
They had some crazy dispute.
There was some argument when they hated 

2089
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:06,290
each other,
he'd been fighting for.

2090
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:07,500
Jeremy Horn is like one of the nicest 
guys in the world.

2091
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:12,501
Yeah.
And Jeremy choked him out and spit on 

2092
01:29:12,501 --> 01:29:12,501
him.
Well,

2093
01:29:12,501 --> 01:29:12,870
he was out cold.
I don't know what happened,

2094
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:15,810
but Jeremy's the nicest guy ever.
He's also a fighter,

2095
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:19,530
but I'm telling you like the idea that 
Jeremy,

2096
01:29:19,531 --> 01:29:20,790
he gets so upset at someone.

2097
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,100
It's almost alien to me.
I don't understand it.

2098
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:28,370
Who Does Nate Diaz fight next?
You should fight Robbie lawler at UFC 

2099
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:32,901
200 if no,
I would say dose on Joseph's the fight 

2100
01:29:32,901 --> 01:29:33,810
because I think that Robbie lawler is 
too big for him.

2101
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:36,990
If he's going to really fight at one 70,
he should.

2102
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:39,560
I mean,
if he could fight at one 70,

2103
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:44,590
make no mistake about it.
But if you look at like the Rory 

2104
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:44,590
Macdonald fight and you look at the,
um,

2105
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,890
uh,
a stun gun,

2106
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:49,740
Kim fight,
he could also,

2107
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:53,010
you could easily make an argument and I 
think it's not even an argument of fact.

2108
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,190
He's a lot better than he was when he 
fought Rory Macdonald.

2109
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:58,080
And he's a lot better than he was when 
he fought don young.

2110
01:29:58,081 --> 01:29:59,190
Kim,
I think his fight,

2111
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:02,340
his last fight in particular,
not just the conor mcgregor fight,

2112
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:04,680
but the fight with Michael Johnson ever 
look,

2113
01:30:04,681 --> 01:30:05,610
he's on fire.

2114
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:10,670
Nate is comfortable,
he's confident and nate is one of the 

2115
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:12,480
slickest dudes when it comes to rolling 
with punches.

2116
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,360
When kit,
when nate gets hit,

2117
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:19,180
nate gets hit and he goes with shit 
going was shit like.

2118
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:24,310
And he's got this like Long Slinky 
fucking jab that comes out of nowhere.

2119
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:29,810
You have to give them a super after 
being conor mcgregor and he has such 

2120
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:31,710
fucking momentum whether he agrees with 
what the UFC does,

2121
01:30:31,711 --> 01:30:34,800
whatever you have to give that guy.
I think a title shot.

2122
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:39,240
Well the UFC,
I think they have to recognize that he's

2123
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:40,740
a superstar right now.
Nate.

2124
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:44,400
Nate Diaz is a fucking superstar.
Fifty five I think.

2125
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,700
Fifty five.
Weight 55 or seven.

2126
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:48,960
But if you give him 70,
just give them more than two weeks.

2127
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:53,961
Notice I,
I mean I think he has a better chance 

2128
01:30:53,961 --> 01:30:55,130
beating Robbie lawler than he does this 
guy.

2129
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:57,570
Rob.
Just a strong man.

2130
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,270
I don't,
well,

2131
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,920
they'll Sanchez was his last before he 
fought.

2132
01:31:01,921 --> 01:31:06,921
Michael Johnson,
those lunges leg kick the shit out of 

2133
01:31:06,921 --> 01:31:09,651
them and horrible and mangled them on 
the ground once his leg was all fucked 

2134
01:31:09,651 --> 01:31:09,651
up.

2135
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:13,510
God damned.
Juggernaut bikes.

2136
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,110
Connor.
That's what I think.

2137
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:15,900
No,
come on.

2138
01:31:15,901 --> 01:31:17,010
Come on.
You can't do that.

2139
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:17,940
No,
you can't do that.

2140
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:23,340
You can't.
That's Connor's worst matchup supposed 

2141
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,641
to see anymore.
I don't think it works out well for 

2142
01:31:25,641 --> 01:31:26,390
Connor.
Come on man.

2143
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,580
What if he sleeps?
I'm okay.

2144
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:33,860
Whack.
What if you want to purchase them like 

2145
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:34,950
you did all this chaos.
That's possible.

2146
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,550
It is possible to go to 1:45
fight Frankie,

2147
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:43,580
and then let's talk about 54.
I think he kind of has to defend his 

2148
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:43,580
title,
right?

2149
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:46,060
You can't lose that 70 than fight the 
champ at 55 and then go back.

2150
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:46,930
Okay.
Here's my.

2151
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:49,680
Here's a big thing.
Here's a question.

2152
01:31:49,681 --> 01:31:53,020
I'm not saying.
I'm asking a question.

2153
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:55,200
We go,
is it possible?

2154
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:56,670
Is it going to take a shit?
Look,

2155
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,090
is it possible that conor mcgregor,
because he's

2156
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,170
an excellent boxer and he's got that 
left hand,

2157
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,830
is it possible that we're going to see 
people game plan to say,

2158
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:08,080
Hey,
just stay away from that left hand,

2159
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:11,890
and if you do you can just grab them and
grind them into the ground.

2160
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:15,440
I can get shit for that.
In other words,

2161
01:32:15,441 --> 01:32:16,600
what do you taught?
It's nothing new.

2162
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:21,630
In other words,
you want to say a question and you just 

2163
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:21,630
came up with a question.
My question,

2164
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:23,710
my thought it was right.
Jamie knows everyone knows,

2165
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:25,870
asked you this.
In other words,

2166
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:30,990
do you think that if he gets it,
I guess what I'm really asking is you 

2167
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:32,530
spit it out.
What I'm really asking is,

2168
01:32:32,531 --> 01:32:37,531
is he.
Is he just really good with that left 

2169
01:32:37,531 --> 01:32:38,010
hand and if you negate that,
he becomes ordinary,

2170
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,920
but he's good.
He's an excellent fighter.

2171
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:42,880
He's amazing.
He's the last one,

2172
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:43,480
78.

2173
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,960
You don't just knock out,
although with one punch destroy markers,

2174
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,940
image destroyed.
Diego Brandao.

2175
01:32:48,941 --> 01:32:50,680
He's destroyed.
Dennis seaver,

2176
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:53,740
he looks like a murderer.
Smash Chad Mendez.

2177
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:59,100
Conor mcgregor is a gangster.
There's no doubt that he just got a 

2178
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,960
little crazy if you want to.
Anybody.

2179
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,450
He went up all the way up to one 72.
Granted,

2180
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:06,760
he fought nate Diaz is not a real one 70
anyway,

2181
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:08,200
but he's a legit one.
50th five.

2182
01:33:08,201 --> 01:33:11,200
We can't make 1:45.
Nate can't make 1:45.

2183
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,750
You see nate cut down to 55.
He is fucking troll reddit.

2184
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:19,270
So another 10 pounds after that.
That's not gonna happen.

2185
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,420
But Connor could make that way.
So you gotta think that nate is a bigger

2186
01:33:22,421 --> 01:33:27,421
guy and I'll tell you why.
Connor's still the biggest draw in the 

2187
01:33:27,421 --> 01:33:28,000
UFC because in everyone should take 
notes.

2188
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:31,390
The way he's handled this loss.
He doesn't go into hiding champ.

2189
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:33,100
He's not not doing interviews.

2190
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,260
He's not talking shit.
Just what's up?

2191
01:33:35,261 --> 01:33:35,950
Yeah.
I took a chance.

2192
01:33:35,951 --> 01:33:39,030
I fucking lost man.
I will not apologize.

2193
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,240
Took a fucking risk.
Who's fucking next?

2194
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:43,210
Well,
he loaded up on nate.

2195
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:46,150
He tried to take them out with one shot 
at a time and you just can't do that.

2196
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:51,210
It's just not that easy.
It's not an easy how it keeps us on 

2197
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:51,210
Joe's.
Besides knocking them out,

2198
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:53,010
keeps them away from him.
I feel good question.

2199
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,940
Just grabs him.
It's a big,

2200
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:56,270
big problem.
Totally different.

2201
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,630
I haven't seen any answer to that.
Totally different animal.

2202
01:33:58,631 --> 01:33:59,780
Physically.
He's still sound.

2203
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:02,820
Joe's has these thick ass ankles and 
thick as risks.

2204
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:08,280
Thick ass.
He's a thick motherfucker up knocking 

2205
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:11,011
him out,
have fun getting kicked in the leg by 

2206
01:34:11,011 --> 01:34:13,021
him and then grabbed around the was also
his paces in Sadie's breaking dudes.

2207
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:15,610
Especially at 55.
When I watched his fight with pedes,

2208
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:16,350
I was like,
oh,

2209
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:17,890
how's this guy keeping this up?

2210
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,090
See that.
That's not the move.

2211
01:34:19,091 --> 01:34:19,520
I.
If,

2212
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:22,390
if I'm Connor's manager,
I haven't first take some time off.

2213
01:34:22,391 --> 01:34:24,720
He doesn't fight at UFC 200.
He's crazy.

2214
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,670
He's fighting UFC $200.
Well why would he not?

2215
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:32,700
When is that?
Because you just bought that fucking 

2216
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:32,700
murked you need a break.
Has Do an interviews.

2217
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:37,630
Twenty four slash seven a couple of 
times a shot for a take down on the 

2218
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:37,810
ground.
Duncan coked out.

2219
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,720
Do you think you got a concussion?
Yeah,

2220
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:45,721
he got fucking a one.
Two from fucking Nate Diaz was on 

2221
01:34:45,721 --> 01:34:45,850
wobbles street.
But is that a congressional fuck?

2222
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,040
Your shot a double leg?
I know he did.

2223
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:53,190
But what is technically concussion?
Your brain fucked up and you can double 

2224
01:34:53,190 --> 01:34:55,090
and then you revert back to old school 
ways.

2225
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:56,860
That's when your brain's bruised.
Right?

2226
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:57,890
Right.
Medically,

2227
01:34:57,930 --> 01:34:58,070
like

2228
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,320
medically,
I think it's when you bruise your brain.

2229
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:02,810
I don't know when will we know that he 
got his bell rung.

2230
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:05,060
We know he got rocked,
we saw his legs buckle,

2231
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:07,910
we saw nate beat the piss out of him on 
the ground before he choked him.

2232
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,350
Right?
So all those count.

2233
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,290
Right?
So yeah.

2234
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:16,330
So I wonder how much damage he did and I
wonder how much time he really should 

2235
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:19,210
take off because it's not the same like 
this obviously levels of it.

2236
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:22,220
Like Rhonda getting head kicked by Holly
is like the highest level.

2237
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:25,970
The highest level is getting Gonzaga.
When Gonzaga knocked out,

2238
01:35:25,971 --> 01:35:28,540
cro cop,
that was like the height that's going to

2239
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:30,410
take a year period.
He's even better.

2240
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:35,411
Here's even better.
Terry Edom versus Barboza Barboza we'll 

2241
01:35:35,411 --> 01:35:37,330
carry Adam.
That's the highest level of chaos.

2242
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:40,490
Go and take some time off to the highest
level of the rest of your life,

2243
01:35:40,491 --> 01:35:41,720
but either way it see,
we say,

2244
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:42,980
well,
he just got his bell rung.

2245
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,100
That's a bring trauma,
but there's levels.

2246
01:35:46,101 --> 01:35:50,270
Right,
but what's the UFC $200 for what?

2247
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,820
For what?
Why not do another day?

2248
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:56,660
He's going to get paper no matter what.
Also also,

2249
01:35:56,661 --> 01:35:59,810
how long has your career,
like just injuries and stuff.

2250
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:00,740
Man,
I don't know.

2251
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:06,190
We need to look at Chad Mendez.
Chad Mendez goes and getting stopped by 

2252
01:36:06,190 --> 01:36:08,690
connor and then immediately gets knocked
out with one punch by Frankie and showed

2253
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:10,460
like,
like that's not normal for him.

2254
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,470
Usually he can take a really good shot.
Yeah man.

2255
01:36:12,471 --> 01:36:14,870
So he goes from that to that.
Now was the.

2256
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:19,900
When was the Ricardo Lamas?
Fight was before the conor fight right 

2257
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:20,180
before color.
So he fights Ricardo Lamas,

2258
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:22,070
dust him with one punch,
hurts them,

2259
01:36:22,071 --> 01:36:23,570
at least with one person that puts them 
away.

2260
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:26,060
Flights.
Connor loses that fight,

2261
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:28,420
get stopped and gets really rocked,
Kinda hits them.

2262
01:36:28,421 --> 01:36:30,390
It's a big lift and knocked out,
but he kind of just.

2263
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,020
He was so tired.
Then he got,

2264
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:38,080
he got,
he got 10 percent and then frankie just 

2265
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:43,091
takes them out with one left hook.
Fucking New Jersey son Tom Connors camp.

2266
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:47,540
I'm losing sleep over that guy.
Frankie Edgar.

2267
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:52,580
Mind he said,
best match up if he loses to Frankie.

2268
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:54,560
What?
Where does connor,

2269
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:58,310
what happens to conor at that point?
That's a real good question.

2270
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,680
Um,
if he loses the Frankie,

2271
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:03,050
he's got a really figure out how to 
regroup.

2272
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:08,140
It depends on how Frankie beats him.
If Frankie takes him down and beat the 

2273
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:08,810
fuck out of them on the ground,
and then we've got,

2274
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:11,780
he's got a real problem.
What I'm saying is a lot of sense.

2275
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:12,560
How you,
oh,

2276
01:37:12,561 --> 01:37:17,561
that's the blueprint at Brian.
There's everyone knows that type 

2277
01:37:17,561 --> 01:37:18,080
economy.
Everyone tries to do that.

2278
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:23,090
Then they get fucking knocked out where 
everyone knows everyone in this entire 

2279
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:26,711
world knows connor's weak point is 
grappling with arguments that he hasn't 

2280
01:37:26,711 --> 01:37:28,990
seen a real grappler.
He's Chad Mendez except for just Chad.

2281
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:32,210
Just go for one round Duffy.
Who was the guy who beat him,

2282
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,840
beat him.
Joe Duffy arm triangle though.

2283
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:38,860
That's what I mean.
So what I'm saying is that I'm telling 

2284
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:38,860
you,
you're saying nothing new.

2285
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:38,860
No,
I,

2286
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:38,860
I,
no,

2287
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:41,980
I,
I'm just saying that when you see what's

2288
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,580
happening in the news,
what you see,

2289
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,470
which did.
Fingers ready.

2290
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:50,500
Brendan's a bullying.
Brendan's broken down.

2291
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:52,730
You can.
No,

2292
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:54,830
no,
that's not what this is about.

2293
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:56,040
Pride.
Just hear me

2294
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,690
out.
I'm going to take some pain from this.

2295
01:37:57,930 --> 01:38:01,840
No one's ever heard this.
What if he brands fight conor?

2296
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:05,230
No.
Hear me out.

2297
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,770
I know what I'm saying.
What if I said it when his head is.

2298
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:10,650
If you could just get away with.
All you have to do is stay away from his

2299
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:11,610
left hand.
It's the game.

2300
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:14,190
Not True because he kicks.
Good.

2301
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,790
Connor's got his right hands.
Amazing to.

2302
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,440
Did you say kicks our rice kicking?
Didn't do a thing tonight.

2303
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,060
That Nate Diaz.
Okay.

2304
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:24,080
Yes it did.
He like kicks.

2305
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:29,390
He just,
he didn't throw his kicks are like the 

2306
01:38:29,390 --> 01:38:29,390
Sanchez is what I'm saying.
They're not like.

2307
01:38:29,390 --> 01:38:32,090
You can't say he's a different kind of 
kicking in the door.

2308
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:37,310
I can't entertain this conversation.
I don't think it counts as his kicks 

2309
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:37,310
are.
All right.

2310
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:40,040
In comparison to a lot of guys,
I feel like that's not your own.

2311
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,570
When you fight conor,
you're more worried about his lefthand.

2312
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,430
You're not.
You're not worried about getting knocked

2313
01:38:44,431 --> 01:38:45,120
out.
Like holly,

2314
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:50,300
you say,
be careful of that round house you're 

2315
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,221
going to get knocked out with.
Does not just watch out for those leg 

2316
01:38:52,221 --> 01:38:52,221
kicks with all the watch over the leg 
kicks with connor.

2317
01:38:52,221 --> 01:38:54,120
You're saying stay away from that left 
hand.

2318
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:55,890
Let me tell you yes,
but let me tell you something.

2319
01:38:55,891 --> 01:38:58,200
If he kicked you in the face,
he can knock you out that way too and he

2320
01:38:58,201 --> 01:38:59,610
can kick in the face,
but he hasn't done it.

2321
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,620
It doesn't mean anything.
He's got.

2322
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:05,310
He's got a lethal lefthand for sure,
but when I watched him throw kicks,

2323
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,680
we're closer,
so it throws a lot of kicks,

2324
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:08,940
man.
He throws a lot of kicks in.

2325
01:39:08,941 --> 01:39:12,270
A lot of times what he's doing and she's
throwing almost disdainful kicks setting

2326
01:39:12,271 --> 01:39:12,600
you up.

2327
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:13,980
Well,
he's relaxed with them.

2328
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:16,080
He's just throwing them in there.
He just throws them in there.

2329
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:21,081
He's not like fucking written down and 
digging in and Barboza grits down.

2330
01:39:21,871 --> 01:39:23,240
Dig.
That's exactly what I'm saying though,

2331
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:26,760
is that the kicks themselves might be 
there as a distraction,

2332
01:39:26,761 --> 01:39:28,950
but you're not going to have to.
It's not like your coach says,

2333
01:39:28,951 --> 01:39:30,540
listen,
those kicks are going to knock you out.

2334
01:39:30,541 --> 01:39:33,030
Whereas Barbosa of the Chad Mendez 
fight,

2335
01:39:33,031 --> 01:39:34,950
because he fucked Chad up with kicks to 
the body.

2336
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:38,340
He hits with a heart spinning back kick 
to the body front,

2337
01:39:38,341 --> 01:39:40,310
kicked him the body a gang of times.
Yeah,

2338
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:45,710
I think he's got a lot of tools.
It's just does he have real world class 

2339
01:39:46,021 --> 01:39:48,870
tools?
Like here's the most world class striker

2340
01:39:48,871 --> 01:39:51,140
right now in MMA.
Wonderboy,

2341
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:52,900
that's the most.
Yes.

2342
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,280
Most dynamic and exciting striker in 
mma,

2343
01:39:57,030 --> 01:40:02,030
what he's doing is he's sport karate but
Moitai skills and wrestling,

2344
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:07,940
takedown defense,
and that combination is fucking 

2345
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:07,940
ridiculous and answer just me.

2346
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:09,810
It's crazy.
He's fighting him.

2347
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:14,820
Fight his hands down and can't find a a.
You can't find a sparring partner.

2348
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:16,660
The match him.
Well,

2349
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,740
he's.
He was 57 and.

2350
01:40:18,741 --> 01:40:20,610
Oh,
I think it was seven.

2351
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,970
Yeah.
What the fuck?

2352
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,100
This is.
What's crazy?

2353
01:40:23,101 --> 01:40:26,550
How crazy is mma where connor loses.
Rhonda loses.

2354
01:40:26,551 --> 01:40:31,551
Holly loses like you can't predict it.
Everyone except for that bad 

2355
01:40:31,551 --> 01:40:33,000
motherfucker.
Pound for pound number one.

2356
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:34,190
Jon Jones.
I was gonna.

2357
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:35,670
Say Demetrius mighty mouse.
Johnson.

2358
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,380
Now he's lost though.
I'm talking about that,

2359
01:40:37,381 --> 01:40:42,381
but he hasn't.
He hasn't lost since he fought dominick 

2360
01:40:42,381 --> 01:40:42,381
Cruz.
He lost a decision to dominick.

2361
01:40:42,381 --> 01:40:47,361
Cruz still lost.
I'm just saying the guy who has John 

2362
01:40:47,361 --> 01:40:47,361
Joe,
not even close.

2363
01:40:47,361 --> 01:40:50,810
That's true.
John Jones hasn't been well Gustafson 

2364
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:53,410
one fucking train for two weeks.
I want to see him in rumble.

2365
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,130
I really do.

2366
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:57,090
Me To kind of wrestle.
I think if he fights with Rambo,

2367
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:01,420
I think you'll see John John's take 
rumble down maybe second round.

2368
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:04,980
Take them down first.
Here's the good about John is John could

2369
01:41:04,981 --> 01:41:07,360
be the nail.
He's not just the hammer.

2370
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:12,420
He can be the nail and it's one of the 
things that's really scary about him 

2371
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:15,300
because he's so fucking talented,
but he still can take a beating and he 

2372
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,751
does not give up.
He got his arm basically snapped 

2373
01:41:18,751 --> 01:41:19,960
backwards by Vito Belfort and they 
submitted Vittorio later in the fight.

2374
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:24,500
I mean he.
He tore his entire body on him.

2375
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:29,820
He fought shale son and beat the fuck 
out of him and he being the fuck out of 

2376
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:30,160
him.
He broke his toe sideways,

2377
01:41:30,161 --> 01:41:35,161
twisted it around backwards,
and he didn't even realize it until we 

2378
01:41:35,161 --> 01:41:38,551
were talking.
He didn't even realize until he had his 

2379
01:41:38,551 --> 01:41:41,401
belt on and he looks down in the bottom 
of his big toe is facing up.

2380
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:43,480
Oh,
that's wild.

2381
01:41:43,481 --> 01:41:45,660
Jon Jones.
Now he's lifting and pray.

2382
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:48,210
They're like beating him,
lifting and drinking.

2383
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:53,230
Fucking everything in praying.
He's drinking Fiji Water and doing 

2384
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:53,230
squats.
I love it.

2385
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:53,500
That's his instagram.
They show them lifted and was like,

2386
01:41:53,501 --> 01:41:54,970
he's changed.
This is brilliant.

2387
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:57,390
Fucking changed.
This is cynical,

2388
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,680
Brendan.
Brendan Shop.

2389
01:41:59,681 --> 01:42:04,681
Who doesn't believe in movement.
Coaches also doesn't believe Jon Jones 

2390
01:42:04,681 --> 01:42:04,681
is Cherry.
He does.

2391
01:42:04,681 --> 01:42:05,380
He just.
I'm saying,

2392
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,730
good luck.
Beaten that dude.

2393
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,190
Good luck.
Good luck beating that dude.

2394
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:12,550
And if he's.
If he is super dedicated,

2395
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:13,480
even more,
good luck.

2396
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,380
Beaten up.
Hopefully.

2397
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:17,440
Sometimes you need that wildcard for 
greatness.

2398
01:42:17,441 --> 01:42:18,940
You know,
you need to be a little crazy.

2399
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:20,350
I,
I believe that.

2400
01:42:20,351 --> 01:42:25,351
He's a wild motherfucker.
I want my champion a couple of lines 

2401
01:42:25,351 --> 01:42:27,961
here and my chicken continent.
Dude prostitutes when you did that 

2402
01:42:27,961 --> 01:42:30,100
interview with him and Daniel Cormier.
We're in the middle.

2403
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:32,280
I,
I the,

2404
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:33,730
the look and Jon Jones.

2405
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:36,190
He's terrifying.
What?

2406
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:38,840
So what happened when the camera wasn't 
rolling,

2407
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:41,780
they wouldn't talk to each other before 
and they.

2408
01:42:41,781 --> 01:42:46,781
And afterwards John was,
they were talking mad shit on the way 

2409
01:42:46,781 --> 01:42:50,551
out in the parking lot,
but I didn't witness that so I can't 

2410
01:42:50,551 --> 01:42:50,551
really speak on that.
But before it,

2411
01:42:50,551 --> 01:42:52,180
like I had a conversation with Danielle 
before.

2412
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:55,480
It's separately,
a quick conversation with John before it

2413
01:42:55,481 --> 01:42:57,760
separately just saying what's up,
how's everything,

2414
01:42:57,761 --> 01:42:59,960
you know,
just Chit Chat and um,

2415
01:43:00,650 --> 01:43:01,380
you know,
seeing how,

2416
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:02,840
how he's doing,
you know,

2417
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:05,800
that kind of stuff.
And he's fucking terrifying man.

2418
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:08,110
He's when he's focused,
what the shit.

2419
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:09,820
Some of the shit that he was saying that
Daniel was like,

2420
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:11,370
yeah.
He's like,

2421
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:14,620
he's like,
Daniel's problem is I'm the Alpha and he

2422
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:19,621
wants to be the Alpha,
but he knows he's always going to be my 

2423
01:43:19,621 --> 01:43:19,621
pussy.
Yeah,

2424
01:43:19,621 --> 01:43:19,621
you're always going to be my pussy.

2425
01:43:19,621 --> 01:43:21,250
I don't know if they,
Kelly did it.

2426
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,330
They didn't put that just alpha.
They took off the pussy.

2427
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:27,070
I each other you can see that they 
would,

2428
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:30,370
they should leave and I agree.
That's a mistake.

2429
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:35,371
Did she leave that in saying what Jon 
Jones to go full fucking Batman Joker.

2430
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,290
Just be the heel.
Dartmouth.

2431
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:40,390
Daniel was pretty intense to man when 
Daniel was looking at him.

2432
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,990
Sometimes fighters will say things and 
you go,

2433
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,500
well,
he doesn't really believe that,

2434
01:43:44,501 --> 01:43:46,510
but he's saying that Daniel was telling 
them,

2435
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:50,650
I am going to do everything in my power.
I'm willing to die to beat you.

2436
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,550
I'm willing to die.
John say goes.

2437
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:54,200
You better be willing to.
Tom.

2438
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,560
Tom Wasn't shaken by it at all,
but Daniel was super emotional.

2439
01:43:57,660 --> 01:43:58,700
It was intense,
man.

2440
01:43:58,970 --> 01:43:59,870
It was really,
really,

2441
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:03,800
really excited for that fight.
That is April,

2442
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,000
April.
I'm excited for that fight.

2443
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:06,770
I don't think it changes,
but I'm excited for it.

2444
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:09,050
You want to come?
When is it?

2445
01:44:09,051 --> 01:44:11,750
Because we might be on tour.
We are Midwest tour in April.

2446
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:13,430
Are you guys on tour?
Why don't you guys both come?

2447
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:16,550
We could,
but we have a show at 23rd and 24th.

2448
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:17,570
Oh,
you have a show that night.

2449
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:22,070
Now we have a show in Oklahoma as well.
What a great move being in Oklahoma.

2450
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:22,790
Well,
I know.

2451
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:25,450
Damn well I don't go to UC events by 
Kate.

2452
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:26,240
Can we talk to you in the back?

2453
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:34,200
What are they going to be mad at?
You might take an interview with Eric 

2454
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,060
who wanted to stand just like Robert 
Deniro.

2455
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:35,890
Yeah,
back there.

2456
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:37,460
Why is that?
Flag.

2457
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:38,130
Ah,
Shit.

2458
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:40,520
Yeah.
Shop died.

2459
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:41,600
Who killed them?
We have no idea.

2460
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:42,900
He just seen me.
Sorry.

2461
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:48,150
Dana white onto the end of the day.
What you do for the UFC by talking about

2462
01:44:48,711 --> 01:44:50,300
fights.
It hypes up fights.

2463
01:44:50,301 --> 01:44:50,960
Yes.
You know,

2464
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:56,200
you to let you gotta let it a little be 
a little bit looser because you're 

2465
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,831
dealing with 500 different fighters.
So there's hundreds of potential 

2466
01:44:59,931 --> 01:45:02,840
matchups and maybe thousands if you 
count them all up.

2467
01:45:02,841 --> 01:45:04,370
Right?
And you know,

2468
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:06,920
there's a lot of disagreement is a lot 
of debate,

2469
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:10,600
but what you guys do with the fighter 
and the kid going to get podcasts for or

2470
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:16,240
FTC Kay,
um,

2471
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:22,070
from my tour schedule guys do is you,
you create interest,

2472
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:24,230
you get people excited,
you discuss things.

2473
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:25,340
It's fun,
it's entertaining.

2474
01:45:25,341 --> 01:45:26,350
This is the thing though,
Joe.

2475
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:29,300
It's like who pays our bills?
Not the UFC.

2476
01:45:29,301 --> 01:45:31,370
I can say whatever I want to realist 
way.

2477
01:45:31,490 --> 01:45:36,490
Fox doesn't pay my bills so I'm.
There's no fucking regulator on it and 

2478
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:38,870
you're fair and it's rare really 
sometimes.

2479
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:42,950
Well I think that what you guys do is 
valuable though.

2480
01:45:43,010 --> 01:45:46,490
It's what I was trying to say.
It's worth a lot like they can't.

2481
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:51,491
You can't always control the message 
that comes out when it comes to 

2482
01:45:51,491 --> 01:45:54,560
something as exciting and dynamic and 
multifaceted as MMA fights.

2483
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:59,720
It was just too much shit going on.
And then when it comes to things like 

2484
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:01,100
controversial things like the reebok 
deal or you know,

2485
01:46:01,101 --> 01:46:01,610
any,
any,

2486
01:46:01,611 --> 01:46:06,611
any other kind of a sponsored situation 
or anything along those lines where 

2487
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:10,361
there's a lot of disagreement.
You gotta you gotTa Kinda like let all 

2488
01:46:10,361 --> 01:46:10,361
that play out.

2489
01:46:10,361 --> 01:46:14,260
Like if you don't let all that play out,
like you're dealing with like a super 

2490
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:18,011
dynamic sport and there's so many 
different areas to explore in all those 

2491
01:46:18,011 --> 01:46:18,500
areas.
Create interest.

2492
01:46:18,650 --> 01:46:20,540
And I think by limiting the 
conversation,

2493
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:25,570
what you do is you limit the amount of 
interest because there's going to be 

2494
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:29,171
disagreements,
it's going to be people that are pro 

2495
01:46:29,171 --> 01:46:31,061
this and pro that pro her at pro him.
And if you got a guy like you is 

2496
01:46:31,341 --> 01:46:33,800
controversial and it says a bunch of 
crazy shit,

2497
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:39,010
like all that does is like blossom.
And at the end of the day you're not a 

2498
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:39,010
bad guy.
You like mma,

2499
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:40,220
you love the UFC,
you,

2500
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:45,280
you,
you're genuinely intrigued about these 

2501
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,190
ups.
You just have a controversial point of 

2502
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:48,190
view.
But that shouldn't be silenced.

2503
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:48,290
I agree.
And it's also that,

2504
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:50,190
you know,
with the reebok deal

2505
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,390
or any of these match ups,
it when you turn on you,

2506
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,840
it lets you watch UFC tonight who's 
paying their bills.

2507
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:57,990
These guys can't be real dope.
The fighters with the Reebok,

2508
01:46:57,991 --> 01:46:59,610
you'll,
they can't come out because they can get

2509
01:46:59,611 --> 01:47:00,600
backlash.
Not always.

2510
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:02,190
The first guy where,
yeah,

2511
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:07,250
they're censored.
So I was the first guy where I'm not 

2512
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:07,380
censoring so I can stay out is like go,
you're a hater.

2513
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:12,381
I'm not a hater.
I'm one of the first guys that they 

2514
01:47:12,381 --> 01:47:12,450
can't do anything to me.
There's really nothing to do.

2515
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:17,480
It's awesome.
So they banned me from UFC tonight in a 

2516
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:17,490
UFC fight pass.
I don't give a fuck.

2517
01:47:17,491 --> 01:47:19,640
I want double the money.
That's why I got banned.

2518
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:22,590
They did it.
There's just for the first time it was a

2519
01:47:22,591 --> 01:47:26,130
guy with a voice and no one reeboks not 
pay the bills.

2520
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:27,180
Zuph was not Pittsburgh.

2521
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:29,460
Dana's done my goal and make sure you 
promote this.

2522
01:47:29,461 --> 01:47:29,980
I do it.
Fuck.

2523
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,000
It would be a shame if they were,
because it'd be a shame if you stopped 

2524
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,130
doing it the way you're doing it because
that's what's fun about it.

2525
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:38,940
What's fun about your show is that you 
know that if you get Brennan wound up,

2526
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:40,860
he'll start talking some crazy shit.
I do,

2527
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:46,210
and I do an MMA journalist.
They probably wrote three stories 

2528
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:46,470
already during the time we've been doing
this podcast.

2529
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:51,860
About three.
Still one about Joe Rogan disrespects 

2530
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:51,860
me.
She's asset.

2531
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:51,860
Brian Caraway.
That's probably one of them.

2532
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:53,190
You guys told me something about Fried 
Chicken,

2533
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:55,530
fried chicken,
and we bullied you.

2534
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,580
Bullied,
and I'm sure there's our county Mac.

2535
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:01,230
Yeah.
Brian Callahan is a wrestling expert,

2536
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:06,010
pushing kids and breaking news.
How you be conor mcgregor wrestling,

2537
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:11,690
not impressed with conor Mcgregor's.
Then someone shows a highlight reel of 

2538
01:48:12,481 --> 01:48:14,290
conor Mcgregor doing spinning wheel 
kicks,

2539
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:17,880
kicks,
and dropping Chad Mendez.

2540
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:19,800
The Internet is.
I'll get 50 guys.

2541
01:48:19,801 --> 01:48:20,370
Call.
Dude.

2542
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:22,800
You were the only one who knew about the
case.

2543
01:48:22,801 --> 01:48:25,430
I can tell you when you get like six 
people going,

2544
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:30,680
you should never talk about that.
I may hear a piece of shit while you're 

2545
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:30,680
going to have both for sure.
I don't really.

2546
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,370
I don't read them anymore.
Ever since talking to you,

2547
01:48:32,371 --> 01:48:33,840
you're like,
don't read that shit.

2548
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:38,190
If she choose who you communicate with 
in his life and one of the things that's

2549
01:48:38,191 --> 01:48:43,191
good about criticism and online 
criticism as you can learn how other 

2550
01:48:43,191 --> 01:48:43,191
people view you and you can go,
okay,

2551
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:43,890
yeah,
I see.

2552
01:48:43,891 --> 01:48:45,150
That's right.
That's kind of valid.

2553
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:50,600
Maybe I came off Douchey or maybe I 
should preface that better or maybe I 

2554
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:53,801
should explain myself better,
but then you realize that some of the 

2555
01:48:53,801 --> 01:48:53,801
people are just trying to hurt your 
feelings.

2556
01:48:53,801 --> 01:48:55,020
Yes,
and then you have to realize,

2557
01:48:55,021 --> 01:48:57,060
well,
what kind of a person just tries to hurt

2558
01:48:57,061 --> 01:48:59,160
your feelings.
Losers.

2559
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:00,290
Yes.
That's it.

2560
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:01,060
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

2561
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:05,550
Anybody who's got a.
they're trying to hurt your feelings,

2562
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:06,840
reaching out to big,
Brown,

2563
01:49:06,990 --> 01:49:09,000
trying to make you feel bad.
Why are they doing that?

2564
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:11,580
Why?
Why waste all that time?

2565
01:49:11,581 --> 01:49:16,581
Like what is their,
their humor involved in what you're 

2566
01:49:16,581 --> 01:49:16,590
doing or other people enjoying it.
Like is there a method to it?

2567
01:49:16,591 --> 01:49:19,650
Were you trying to say,
do you have a message or you just trying

2568
01:49:19,651 --> 01:49:21,120
to hurt big browns fan,
but it's also,

2569
01:49:21,121 --> 01:49:26,121
you know,
you're doing something right because 

2570
01:49:26,121 --> 01:49:26,121
he's putting all this positive energy 
out and people are like,

2571
01:49:26,121 --> 01:49:30,560
fuck man,
I'm going to be done once he lost a 

2572
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,550
Travis Browne wrong.
Keeping on keeping on anybody.

2573
01:49:32,551 --> 01:49:34,770
Like look at Kanye West.
I'm not a Kanye West Fan.

2574
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:39,800
I mean see cut logs.
Music is excellent just for this,

2575
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:43,320
but I think is closer.
Ridiculous,

2576
01:49:43,670 --> 01:49:48,670
but the shoes.
But I love the fact that will tweet 

2577
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:48,670
something really stupid and these 
dummies

2578
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:52,980
albany is feeding frenzy that he tweets 
bill cosby's innocent right before.

2579
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:55,090
I mean,
come on,

2580
01:49:55,120 --> 01:50:00,120
that's fucking funny.
That's a master manipulator and a 

2581
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:00,120
marketing guy,
you know,

2582
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:02,440
I used to always go bad on Kanye and I 
and I went out.

2583
01:50:02,441 --> 01:50:05,200
I was like,
why is this guy like everybody likes him

2584
01:50:05,201 --> 01:50:07,000
and I know people are very intelligent 
and speak highly.

2585
01:50:07,001 --> 01:50:10,340
So I tend to look at this body of work 
that you should just read.

2586
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:11,860
He,
well he,

2587
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:15,850
I think I can take kind of wake county 
down but what,

2588
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:19,210
what got to me and I was like this guy 
is produced a shitload of music and it's

2589
01:50:19,211 --> 01:50:21,880
all different.
So I went and bought every song.

2590
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:26,410
I bought every song he's ever done and I
spent three days listening to every song

2591
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:29,170
like three times and I got the lyrics 
right.

2592
01:50:29,171 --> 01:50:29,860
So I was like,
all right,

2593
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:30,400
all right,
look,

2594
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:35,460
you cannot deny this guy is putting out 
crazy amounts of work and it's really 

2595
01:50:35,831 --> 01:50:36,130
good.

2596
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:43,080
But then I started listening to 
interviews that he was giving like long 

2597
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:44,440
ones,
long form interviews and I have to say I

2598
01:50:44,441 --> 01:50:46,810
came full circle musical gene.
He's got.

2599
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:50,710
But he's also got shit to say that I 
agree with like I'm aligned with him.

2600
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:55,920
I think he also trips over his own dick.
He's got arrogant outbursts and you can 

2601
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:55,920
relate.
Yes.

2602
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,260
For Chicago Black Kid because you grew 
up rich and no,

2603
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:03,270
I can relate to an artist who says I'm 
not going to limit myself and I'm not 

2604
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:05,500
going to censor myself and I'm going to 
speak my mind because we live.

2605
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:07,600
He goes,
I feel like people are crazy.

2606
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:12,740
Is it just about your maybach and just 
about your status or is it about 

2607
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:12,740
something else?
You know,

2608
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,320
and he was very eloquent about how I 
spoke.

2609
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:19,470
I love what he said on Jimmy Kimmel that
ranty had about being an artist either 

2610
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:19,470
watch the fucking great.

2611
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:23,290
So a lot of wood fence on.
I tried to convert Brian and I finally.

2612
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:26,680
Did you own a pair of yeezys?
I just got them for my birthday.

2613
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:32,180
They're so hard to get.
Jamie's just to just got some 200 pairs 

2614
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:32,590
of shoes.
He takes pictures of them.

2615
01:51:32,591 --> 01:51:33,640
That's cool.
A lot of shoes.

2616
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:38,490
I love Mandy's my favorite,
these new fucking Solomon there.

2617
01:51:38,491 --> 01:51:41,410
Like a hiking shoe that's a running 
shoe.

2618
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:43,900
Run up hills with these bitches or some 
shit.

2619
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:48,920
The tread and those mothers.
That's a dad shoe athletic dad shoe 

2620
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:49,180
right there.
Let's a fucking mountain hunter show.

2621
01:51:49,181 --> 01:51:50,820
You cut 100 dash.
Yeah,

2622
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:55,830
I've run hills with these motherfuckers.
These things can kill the and those 

2623
01:51:55,830 --> 01:51:57,990
things like hiking boots.
Right,

2624
01:51:58,030 --> 01:52:00,580
but you turned them into a running it 
again right here.

2625
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:01,990
Yeah.
Maybe I'll wear those.

2626
01:52:02,930 --> 01:52:04,570
Super Right real thin.
Sole.

2627
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:05,500
And you could fuck.

2628
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,250
And you feel the ground when we go 
hiking.

2629
01:52:07,251 --> 01:52:09,190
You can we go hunting a mouse?
You could,

2630
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:14,370
but you wouldn't because you would get 
shit in your one unless you were in 

2631
01:52:14,370 --> 01:52:14,370
place that didn't have taken notice of 
Alaska.

2632
01:52:14,370 --> 01:52:16,170
You want to hire,
you want to hire ankle.

2633
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:17,980
You want something that protects your 
ankle a bit more,

2634
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:22,690
but if you're running hills is what I 
use these for fucking me and you and Mr.

2635
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:26,650
Rogen you like shoes for their 
effectiveness and what they actually do.

2636
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:30,590
I just liked the way they look.
I just want to find your feet like a,

2637
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:33,640
like a medieval Chinese woman.
If it look good,

2638
01:52:34,770 --> 01:52:36,250
the Yeezys I was like,
shit,

2639
01:52:36,251 --> 01:52:37,250
they with 13 health,
uh,

2640
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:41,410
twelfth pretty tight for these the other
day at Rei.

2641
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:42,220
And they're like,
Ooh,

2642
01:52:42,221 --> 01:52:43,990
Nice Solomons,
like those kind of guys.

2643
01:52:43,991 --> 01:52:46,970
Those guys are balls,
deep functional shoes.

2644
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:49,650
The guys who would buy like one of them 
water bladders,

2645
01:52:50,850 --> 01:52:52,620
the camel backpack,
Campbell,

2646
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,830
because those guys will carry a water 
bottle.

2647
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:56,860
I liked myself,
man.

2648
01:52:56,920 --> 01:53:00,260
I liked my salesman to be opinionated.
Like I like if I'm.

2649
01:53:00,261 --> 01:53:03,830
I went to buy boots at Rei for a hunting
trip and I was like,

2650
01:53:03,831 --> 01:53:05,960
I'm going to Alaska and I love a guy 
who's like,

2651
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:07,640
oh,
well,

2652
01:53:07,670 --> 01:53:09,950
um,
let me think about this now.

2653
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:11,360
Is it going to be in the winter?
And I'm.

2654
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:13,580
Yeah,
I'm looking at precipitation right now.

2655
01:53:13,581 --> 01:53:15,530
Let me pull up my graph.
Oh my God,

2656
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:18,560
that's my guy.
Sold his soul is a fourth of an inch.

2657
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:20,960
I'm going to say you're going to want 
that and that I want.

2658
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:24,140
I want a guy who speaks in graphs and 
numbers when I buy a car,

2659
01:53:24,141 --> 01:53:26,090
I want to hear the dude get me.
Well,

2660
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:27,620
we got more cabin room in this.

2661
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:29,000
Um,
I'm all about that guy,

2662
01:53:29,001 --> 01:53:32,990
the detail and not talked to a guy at 
the BMW dealership once we're,

2663
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:36,890
we're discussing something about an m 
three and he didn't know Jack Shit.

2664
01:53:38,290 --> 01:53:40,570
I almost wanted to get away from him.
Now I'm starting to ask.

2665
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:42,180
Yeah.
I'm like,

2666
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:43,760
does this,
does this one have,

2667
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:46,130
you know,
the act of suspended then?

2668
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:47,700
Yeah,
if you don't know,

2669
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:52,750
like your,
this is like one of the best cars you 

2670
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:52,750
guys have ever been taught.
So you're,

2671
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:56,940
yeah,
you're wearing a suit where he'll bmw 

2672
01:53:56,940 --> 01:53:59,201
for sure.
Tell me about the counting these things 

2673
01:53:59,201 --> 01:53:59,201
like,
you know,

2674
01:53:59,201 --> 01:53:59,201
I know more than you.
I'm a comedian.

2675
01:53:59,201 --> 01:54:01,340
When I went to look at my car,
a little private experiment,

2676
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:04,070
I was looking at Audis,
I was looking at a tornado's I was going

2677
01:54:04,071 --> 01:54:06,320
to.
Alexis and I did a little thing.

2678
01:54:06,321 --> 01:54:09,740
It's a chauvinist thing,
but I've found that women saleswomen uh,

2679
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:11,900
don't,
they're not up on the details like guys,

2680
01:54:11,901 --> 01:54:14,150
our guys love numbers,
stats,

2681
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:15,280
pens and all that.

2682
01:54:15,610 --> 01:54:16,430
And,
and I,

2683
01:54:16,431 --> 01:54:18,530
I found that women would usually go,
you know,

2684
01:54:18,531 --> 01:54:19,490
I,
they knew the car,

2685
01:54:19,491 --> 01:54:21,140
but they'd be like,
I don't know about the,

2686
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:23,120
that,
that's something that I'd have to ask.

2687
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:26,430
And they know that guys,
you should definitely not.

2688
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:30,200
I go in with all my research so I don't 
want this gap in my ear off.

2689
01:54:30,201 --> 01:54:32,660
I know what the fuck.
Like when I bought my Prius,

2690
01:54:32,661 --> 01:54:34,850
which the lease is up next month.
Thank Baby Jesus.

2691
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:37,610
I bought it just for kid because I was 
driving all over California.

2692
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:39,020
Right.
The lease is up,

2693
01:54:39,021 --> 01:54:41,240
but when I bought that thing.
So you want to test drive it like,

2694
01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:42,540
no bitch,
it's a prius of.

2695
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:47,560
I'll figure it out.
I don't want to take it around the 

2696
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:47,560
block.
It's depressing for gas mileage.

2697
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:48,650
Then I got in,
I was like,

2698
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,330
I need to figure something out.
Yeah.

2699
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:51,740
Oh yeah.

2700
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:53,380
They will go through the book.
Prius a bum.

2701
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:54,680
Yeah.
You drive your Porsche.

2702
01:54:54,681 --> 01:54:56,990
Like I'd beat him everywhere.
You drive your pores.

2703
01:54:57,160 --> 01:55:01,460
It very carefully.
Only open up when the speed dickhead.

2704
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:06,730
But if you had one of those cars,
you would appreciate what one of those 

2705
01:55:06,730 --> 01:55:06,730
cars can do.
It's a ride.

2706
01:55:06,730 --> 01:55:07,480
It's a piece of art.
Yeah.

2707
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:12,700
When you're driving that thing,
you're driving a finely engineered 

2708
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:16,061
machine that's perfectly balanced.
Take lunch and it has this fucking sound

2709
01:55:17,781 --> 01:55:21,620
of that flat six in the back.
That's why I don't mind driving my car.

2710
01:55:21,621 --> 01:55:22,590
I'm like,
hey man,

2711
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:24,050
don't take corners.
You know what I mean,

2712
01:55:24,051 --> 01:55:24,980
guys,
I'm in traffic.

2713
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:26,400
Thanks.
Well,

2714
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:29,780
it doesn't matter who occasionally get 
out of traffic and when you do,

2715
01:55:29,781 --> 01:55:32,150
it's way more fun to be in his car.
Then you're fucking Grandad,

2716
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:36,770
Grandad,
mobius portion on the road.

2717
01:55:36,771 --> 01:55:41,771
I go fucking a.
it's an elite club.

2718
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:43,980
I had of wave to this guy

2719
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,840
and give them a thumbs up.
He had a corvette,

2720
01:55:45,841 --> 01:55:48,030
zero six.
The new zero six.

2721
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:51,870
The top comes off and so it becomes like
a target and melt your face.

2722
01:55:51,930 --> 01:55:53,520
Oh my God.
Crazy fast.

2723
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:58,580
It sounds so fucking nasty.
Nothing sounds better than a fucking 

2724
01:55:58,580 --> 01:56:00,860
American va.
Something serious.

2725
01:56:04,150 --> 01:56:06,400
Do it.
You know,

2726
01:56:06,610 --> 01:56:10,350
I think when I think that you're gonna 
laugh,

2727
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:11,970
when I think about when you make that 
noiSe,

2728
01:56:11,971 --> 01:56:16,971
I go,
I wouldn't hear my books on tape as 

2729
01:56:16,971 --> 01:56:18,170
loudly as we know the difference between
us.

2730
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,700
That's literally what I wear my head 
when I was like,

2731
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:22,440
ooh,
I couldn't really listen to a book,

2732
01:56:22,441 --> 01:56:24,710
a novel that's my wife gets in my car 
the other day.

2733
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:26,910
She was,
what the fuck are you listening to?

2734
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:30,210
I was listening to the knock on podcast.
Knock on his,

2735
01:56:30,211 --> 01:56:32,340
uh,
archery based podcast by this guy,

2736
01:56:32,341 --> 01:56:37,341
john podcast is all right.

2737
01:56:37,610 --> 01:56:38,810
Yeah.
He's talks about like,

2738
01:56:38,811 --> 01:56:41,970
like fucking super technical shit about 
archery.

2739
01:56:41,971 --> 01:56:43,340
Love it.
Fuck yeah.

2740
01:56:43,341 --> 01:56:48,341
Listen to it every Day.
We still haven't decided if we have a 

2741
01:56:48,341 --> 01:56:48,341
site in my boat.
No,

2742
01:56:48,341 --> 01:56:48,341
no,
no.

2743
01:56:48,341 --> 01:56:50,880
We got to get your boat to a range and 
um,

2744
01:56:50,881 --> 01:56:51,720
we got to get your,
uh,

2745
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:54,010
draw length measured and stuff like do 
that.

2746
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:59,390
Super important.
We're going to go out in august is what 

2747
01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:03,021
we're going to go after.
So what we're going to have is a good 

2748
01:57:03,021 --> 01:57:05,400
solid two to three months of like 
serious preparation and training camp.

2749
01:57:05,401 --> 01:57:10,401
What I want is You to be able to shoot 
accurately to 20 yards and then what I 

2750
01:57:10,401 --> 01:57:12,030
want you to do is not shoot anything 
outside of 20 yards.

2751
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:15,210
They call me in that amount of time.
I think we can get that done.

2752
01:57:15,450 --> 01:57:17,020
I think we can get you to jail.

2753
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:22,150
I'll fuck.
I want to save your time because you're 

2754
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:22,150
busy,
man.

2755
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:22,150
You know brIan's not a hunter,
right?

2756
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:22,150
Hey,
no.

2757
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:23,880
Brian [inaudible].
Brian called me dad.

2758
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:24,430
No,
listen,

2759
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:29,440
I told me.
I watched him shoot several deer and he 

2760
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:30,210
Is steady on the fucking trigger and he 
squeezes.

2761
01:57:30,211 --> 01:57:32,450
He doesn't jerk it.
he's got a great shot.

2762
01:57:32,470 --> 01:57:33,780
He's got a great aim.
No,

2763
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,400
he doesn't.
He doesn't panic.

2764
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:41,440
It makes good shot.
How long you guys going for will 

2765
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:41,440
probably go downtown.
Go.

2766
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:42,060
I better.
You know what?

2767
01:57:42,061 --> 01:57:44,010
We'll be going to be back.
We'll be back with me.

2768
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:47,510
Just know that you wait by the campfire.
We'll be back with fucking me.

2769
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:49,680
You will kill your cushy life with your 
cappuccino.

2770
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:53,040
We'll come back with the fucking meat 
and covered in mosquito bites,

2771
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,610
but it's worth it.
We're going hard and in Nevada and we're

2772
01:57:56,611 --> 01:57:57,780
going into the mountains in Nevada.

2773
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:59,280
We're going to archery hunt for mule 
deer.

2774
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:00,390
Yeah.
And so,

2775
01:58:00,391 --> 01:58:05,391
uh,
we're going to backpack in there and 

2776
01:58:05,391 --> 01:58:07,431
we'll be,
we'll be camping and we're going to be 

2777
01:58:07,431 --> 01:58:07,830
glass and in days I don't care.
But you got this,

2778
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:13,140
you got to five days things.
You gotta do you gotta you gotta we 

2779
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:13,710
gotta fIgure out the both thing.
That's a big one.

2780
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:18,980
That's the biggest one.
And we got to like get you hooked up 

2781
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:20,040
with a bunch of different kinds of 
equipment because with archery,

2782
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:25,070
one of the things that's really 
important because you get really close 

2783
01:58:25,070 --> 01:58:27,051
to them,
you got to know which way the wind's 

2784
01:58:27,051 --> 01:58:27,051
blowing,
so we got to get.

2785
01:58:27,051 --> 01:58:29,811
It's like a little talcum powder bottle 
and you squeeze it into the air and it 

2786
01:58:29,811 --> 01:58:32,280
blows up and then it goes to this 
archery podcast.

2787
01:58:32,281 --> 01:58:37,281
Matter of fact,
It's too deep for you guys should start 

2788
01:58:37,281 --> 01:58:40,221
your own podcast about archery.
If you get to like the one percent of 

2789
01:58:40,221 --> 01:58:41,890
one percent that give a fuck about 
archery.

2790
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:47,510
That's the kind of shit I'm into.
I'm into like leveling your second and 

2791
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:51,871
third axis.
I'm into multi pin sights on a dovetail 

2792
01:58:51,871 --> 01:58:51,871
housing.
I'm into.

2793
01:58:51,871 --> 01:58:52,830
Do you use a kisser?
Butler?

2794
01:58:52,850 --> 01:58:54,230
No kisser button.
Book.

2795
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:55,790
Green arrows.
What's the spine?

2796
01:58:56,230 --> 01:59:00,190
How many past your second shot?
200 arrows the other day.

2797
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:02,470
I got problem.
What is it about?

2798
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:06,140
Of course you do.
What is it about with me?

2799
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:09,670
What is it about the tactile experience 
of archery that you love?

2800
01:59:09,790 --> 01:59:12,580
Like what if I told you I'm just 
something wrong with me man.

2801
01:59:12,581 --> 01:59:17,581
When I get into something,
It's like that thing is like a fucking 

2802
01:59:17,581 --> 01:59:21,571
house.
Could be on fire if I'm shooting 

2803
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:21,571
bullseyes I'm good.
Yeah.

2804
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:25,660
what it is then the flow.
There's a switch that goes off and then 

2805
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,830
I'm no longer driving anymore.
Joe,

2806
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:30,730
don't you?
Don't you think if you picked up golf,

2807
01:59:30,731 --> 01:59:31,620
you'd be [inaudible].

2808
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:34,750
That's why I didn't ever played golf.
Do I?

2809
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:37,450
Don't think you know our trees.
Your passion.

2810
01:59:37,451 --> 01:59:39,610
I think whenever you got into your balls
in,

2811
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:40,780
that's true.
That's true,

2812
01:59:40,781 --> 01:59:43,760
but it has to be cool.
And archery is fucking offsite.

2813
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:46,180
Golf pro.
You will lose your life.

2814
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:48,070
my life with pool.
Dude,

2815
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:51,370
let me tell you something.
I have dreams someday I like.

2816
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:54,570
Sometimes I sit around here and I'll do 
a bunch of podcasts and I'm like,

2817
01:59:54,571 --> 01:59:55,200
ah,
fucking.

2818
01:59:55,600 --> 02:00:00,600
You know what I think I'm going to do.
I'm just going to quit everything and 

2819
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:02,881
just go play pool on tour kits and tends
to run a few racks of fat joint play 

2820
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:06,930
with like meeting fitzsimmons is coming 
over the other.

2821
02:00:07,070 --> 02:00:08,710
I'm not tomorrow,
wednesday,

2822
02:00:08,711 --> 02:00:09,460
thursday,
wednesday,

2823
02:00:09,461 --> 02:00:11,500
tomorrow,
tomorrow with fitz simmons.

2824
02:00:11,501 --> 02:00:12,830
Come over.
You know what I'm really happy about.

2825
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:14,500
We're going to play pool.
That's makes sense.

2826
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:19,510
I'm going to see him.
we're going to play some play some pool 

2827
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:19,510
for sure.
Don't give a fuck.

2828
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:21,460
I feel like.
I know this sounds weird,

2829
02:00:21,461 --> 02:00:23,200
but I watched.
I watched videos.

2830
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:27,700
I watched videos on boxing,
footwork and tennis strokes.

2831
02:00:27,730 --> 02:00:32,730
It's.
I practice that tennis stroke alone in 

2832
02:00:32,730 --> 02:00:32,920
my room with you.
I love it,

2833
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:34,780
dude.
I have a release that I put.

2834
02:00:34,781 --> 02:00:38,320
I put my archery released.
I have a training tool where it's like a

2835
02:00:38,321 --> 02:00:41,680
rope that I pulled back and I hold it 
and I'm watching tv.

2836
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:45,210
I'm firing off shots.
I'm clicking this and I'm watching tv.

2837
02:00:45,211 --> 02:00:46,360
I'm by myself.
I don't give a fuck.

2838
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:49,840
I'm just sitting there with zen about 
it.

2839
02:00:49,841 --> 02:00:50,950
Right.
That's intense,

2840
02:00:50,951 --> 02:00:55,951
man.
Once you kill an elk with a bow and 

2841
02:00:55,951 --> 02:00:55,951
arrow,
dude,

2842
02:00:55,951 --> 02:00:55,951
the world becomes a totally different 
place,

2843
02:00:55,951 --> 02:00:58,450
becomes a totally different place 
because you realize how,

2844
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:01,540
first of all,
how fucking primal and crazy that is,

2845
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:03,340
and then also getting your food that 
way.

2846
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:03,970
You're like,
okay,

2847
02:01:04,210 --> 02:01:09,210
I'm ouT of the factory farming system 
for like if I could do this every year 

2848
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:13,351
I'm out for life.
Like now I'm completely responsible for 

2849
02:01:13,351 --> 02:01:13,351
all the meat.
I get a shoot.

2850
02:01:13,351 --> 02:01:15,430
One animal.
I eat that animal for a year.

2851
02:01:15,490 --> 02:01:18,370
Damn.
What do you eat other stuff too?

2852
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:21,450
like I've shot a dog too and I,
you know,

2853
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:24,860
when I get almost as much satisfaction 
giving friends,

2854
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:26,220
I love it.
I love.

2855
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:29,320
I love getting that elk.
I ate the shit.

2856
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:31,570
Elk sausage,
homemade.

2857
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:35,400
I got a gang of it at home.
He wants more dried,

2858
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:36,220
dried,
right?

2859
02:01:36,221 --> 02:01:38,680
We're calling it.
It's a breakfast sausage.

2860
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:40,090
No summer sausage,
somersaults.

2861
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:42,920
Awesome.
Now I keep.

2862
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:45,080
I keep rolls of it in the frigerator 
backfired.

2863
02:01:45,110 --> 02:01:47,090
It's fucking delicious.
Thing gets raul though.

2864
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:47,540
No,
no,

2865
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:47,870
no,
no,

2866
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:48,530
no.
It's cooked.

2867
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:51,620
It's cooked.
It's cooked skid,

2868
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:53,030
ell,
summer sausage.

2869
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:58,200
But you can cook it.
You could slice it and like quit some 

2870
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:01,820
exotics.
Little hot sauce in my mouth while I 

2871
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:02,840
have venison sausage that I had made to.
Oh my god.

2872
02:02:02,841 --> 02:02:07,841
It's so good.
I had somebody of the day with 

2873
02:02:07,841 --> 02:02:07,841
breakfast.
You guys just keep telling shit,

2874
02:02:07,841 --> 02:02:08,460
man.
You guys keep killing shit and then I'll

2875
02:02:08,461 --> 02:02:13,461
take some of the songs to ain't look.
I like giving away almost as much as I 

2876
02:02:13,461 --> 02:02:14,210
like eating it.
I really did.

2877
02:02:14,270 --> 02:02:16,360
Was awesome.
Like duncan sent me a picture.

2878
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:21,640
Him,
his girlfriend and timothy leary's son 

2879
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:23,520
were eating elk meat balls from an elca 
roundhouse.

2880
02:02:23,530 --> 02:02:24,830
Good.
It's delicious.

2881
02:02:24,831 --> 02:02:26,120
You don't have to.
I can't get enough of.

2882
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:28,790
Is this kombucha drink three a day now?
Is that a problem?

2883
02:02:28,810 --> 02:02:31,370
You know,
I love people think we're doing an ad.

2884
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:33,100
Every time I do something on instagram,
people,

2885
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:36,020
man,
I just fucking love kombucha,

2886
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:41,230
but nOt the bullshit.
Clear can has to be the black 21 and 

2887
02:02:41,230 --> 02:02:43,871
over to let live on the.
Explain that because people don't know 

2888
02:02:43,871 --> 02:02:43,871
what you mean.
Well,

2889
02:02:43,871 --> 02:02:47,711
the clear cam,
they basIcally produced those so they 

2890
02:02:47,711 --> 02:02:47,870
could sell in grocery stores because 
they have no alcohol content in them.

2891
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:49,190
Very little.
Very little.

2892
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:51,860
So the black cans or they have more 
alcohol content.

2893
02:02:51,861 --> 02:02:54,220
How they should be.
How the tea is naturally fermented.

2894
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,630
So you want the black canvas is 21?
No,

2895
02:02:56,690 --> 02:02:58,460
it's not a black hand.
It's a bottle.

2896
02:02:58,461 --> 02:03:00,610
And the difference is the label cost 
top.

2897
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:05,710
It's just the plat,
the plastic rim around the bottle top 

2898
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:06,470
when you open it as black.

2899
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,980
But bro even the bottles are different 
on the 21 million.

2900
02:03:08,990 --> 02:03:10,630
They're darker and it's.
Yes.

2901
02:03:11,310 --> 02:03:16,310
It's something about the fermentation.
Do we have a knife that your samurai 

2902
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:22,181
sword over there from the 15 hundreds.
Go ahead and slice that thin real 

2903
02:03:23,001 --> 02:03:26,420
samurai sword from the 15 hundreds.
Yes it is.

2904
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:30,810
That is a real samurai swords.
Is it aba?

2905
02:03:30,811 --> 02:03:33,670
Gave it to me.
Is it opened that bitch up?

2906
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:39,350
But I feel like this is dangerous.
Your ball or friends,

2907
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:41,290
that's kind of shit they give you.
This isn't a.

2908
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:42,670
This isn't 15 hundreds.
They.

2909
02:03:42,950 --> 02:03:43,910
Oh yes,
it is.

2910
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:48,620
Shut your fucking pawn stars right now.
Shattering.

2911
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:51,920
Excellent.
Thank you so much.

2912
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:57,280
It's 100 percent,
100 percent real blade itself and 

2913
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:57,470
telling me that shit was 49,
99 bright.

2914
02:03:58,070 --> 02:04:00,380
They refurbished the handle and make it 
all perfect.

2915
02:04:00,381 --> 02:04:05,381
But that blade is from the 1500.
The thing looks pretty fucking real.

2916
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:10,000
That's real as fuck a glove and cut that
fucking sausage and stopped jacking off.

2917
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:13,220
People have died by the sword.
Good chance.

2918
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:14,850
if it's that old,
I wonder mean,

2919
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:16,610
you know,
if you think about all the samurai sorts

2920
02:04:16,611 --> 02:04:21,611
in the $1,500,
how many hand in this continuous civil 

2921
02:04:21,611 --> 02:04:21,611
war for about 300 years.
So there's a good chance.

2922
02:04:21,611 --> 02:04:23,330
But what I'm thinking is like,
is it like pistols?

2923
02:04:23,331 --> 02:04:25,430
Like most people who have pistols never 
killed anybody.

2924
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:26,360
True.
You know what I mean?

2925
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:29,550
Like is that what it was like back in 
the day with samurai swords or were they

2926
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:32,140
more liberal or gangster shit?
Yeah,

2927
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:36,110
probably take a little bit of that elk 
son slice into that bitch.

2928
02:04:36,111 --> 02:04:37,440
Oh yeah.
Brian,

2929
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:42,330
the plastic is getting you take a piece 
hate back to the kombucha though.

2930
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:44,700
People have tried telling me the 
benefits are fake on that.

2931
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:47,580
Just so just say,
it's not that good for you.

2932
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:49,140
It'S all.
It's probiotic,

2933
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:54,620
probiotic,
fermented vegetables and fermented 

2934
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:57,450
fermented mushrooms and things on those 
lines,

2935
02:04:57,451 --> 02:05:01,410
which is essentially what kombucha is.
It's like a fungus is very good for you.

2936
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:02,340
It's very good.
Let's go.

2937
02:05:02,341 --> 02:05:03,540
Let's go get you some.
Yeah,

2938
02:05:03,541 --> 02:05:04,410
I can eat that.
Fuck you.

2939
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:08,700
It's very good for you.
Probiotics were like super important.

2940
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,530
Gut health.
Gut health is,

2941
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:12,030
you know,
it's a great way getting it.

2942
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:13,890
I love kimchi,
man.

2943
02:05:13,891 --> 02:05:16,020
I been getting into.
Kim che found a,

2944
02:05:16,021 --> 02:05:18,390
you know,
down near the calabasas.

2945
02:05:18,391 --> 02:05:20,630
You ever go to that calabasas farmer's 
market erewhon.

2946
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,800
Well,
the farmer's market is amazing.

2947
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:24,600
They have like low.
Well I'll take you.

2948
02:05:24,601 --> 02:05:26,010
I'll take you.
Um,

2949
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:29,160
calabasas farmer's market has these 
local,

2950
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:34,240
a kombucha and local kimchis from like 
people that run farms like nearby and 

2951
02:05:36,181 --> 02:05:38,490
then they have their own,
like some spicy.

2952
02:05:38,491 --> 02:05:40,410
So it's pretty good.
that's really good.

2953
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:42,590
I love them.
I love it because I don't drink soda.

2954
02:05:42,591 --> 02:05:47,591
I don't drink soda forever,
but these replaced that for me are way 

2955
02:05:47,591 --> 02:05:47,591
healthier.
What kimchi is,

2956
02:05:47,591 --> 02:05:51,240
I'm actually fermented cabbage.
It's like a spicy fermented cabbage,

2957
02:05:51,241 --> 02:05:54,180
but my point is that it's a really good 
source of probiotics.

2958
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:57,810
I've been eating every morning and I 
don't know if it's because of that,

2959
02:05:57,811 --> 02:05:59,790
but I feel amazing.
Kim.

2960
02:05:59,791 --> 02:06:02,340
She's fantastic with brian.
It's really good for you.

2961
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:04,980
Well,
gut health changes everything,

2962
02:06:04,981 --> 02:06:09,981
man.
If you listen to some of my podcasts 

2963
02:06:09,981 --> 02:06:11,391
I've done with rhonda patrick,
she goes deep into gut health and how 

2964
02:06:11,391 --> 02:06:12,630
important it is for all sorts of aspects
of your personality,

2965
02:06:12,631 --> 02:06:15,210
the way you think about things.
It's amazing.

2966
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:16,680
They did that with the rats where they 
gave.

2967
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:19,890
They've changed the gut health and the 
rat,

2968
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:24,920
like the bacteria and some rats with 
healthy bacteria in their gut kept 

2969
02:06:25,321 --> 02:06:25,830
fighting.

2970
02:06:26,410 --> 02:06:31,410
Um,
I guess to get out of the water and 

2971
02:06:31,410 --> 02:06:34,191
others,
when they change the bacteria in their 

2972
02:06:34,191 --> 02:06:34,191
gut,
it actually changed the serotonin levels

2973
02:06:34,191 --> 02:06:38,070
in their brain because apparently 
serotonin is made in the gut as well.

2974
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:41,970
And they just became listless and gave 
up around.

2975
02:06:42,150 --> 02:06:43,640
Yeah,
it had a bad call.

2976
02:06:43,670 --> 02:06:48,670
That bitch ass was stomach ache.
If you can go swimming,

2977
02:06:50,370 --> 02:06:52,410
makes sure your gut,
your guts.

2978
02:06:52,411 --> 02:06:53,040
Good.
See,

2979
02:06:53,041 --> 02:06:56,200
and this is all this all came from an 
animal that uh,

2980
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:59,580
I mean I was there that you shot in the 
face and the body.

2981
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:02,670
You're shooting in the face though.
Now the phase is a good idea though.

2982
02:07:02,730 --> 02:07:05,850
That'd be if you don't do it because you
really,

2983
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:09,300
it's hard to be that accurate when you 
shoot a body,

2984
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:10,560
like,
especially in elk,

2985
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:15,030
you have a giant target as much as,
as much as you're practicing.

2986
02:07:15,031 --> 02:07:16,500
Let's sort of go over some head shots on
this.

2987
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:22,280
We don't want to do it as taboo.
No guys do it all the time with pigs.

2988
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:23,280
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2989
02:07:23,281 --> 02:07:24,990
There's a show called pig man.
Yeah,

2990
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:30,170
pigman is,
it's kind of hilarious that I watched 

2991
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:30,170
that show and I go,
god,

2992
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:32,600
if vegans ever fucking found out.
Oops,

2993
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:35,450
I let it out.
There's a show called man.

2994
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:35,980
Okay.
And

2995
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,980
this motherfucker is,
he's called pig man because you just 

2996
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:43,531
kills pigs.
He's got a ranch and me hunts all over 

2997
02:07:43,531 --> 02:07:44,740
the world.
Just shot a moose with a bow and arrow.

2998
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:45,800
Pink pigs?
No,

2999
02:07:45,801 --> 02:07:46,180
no,
no.

3000
02:07:46,181 --> 02:07:49,150
WIld invasive,
cute pink pigs.

3001
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:54,180
My love on my instagram.
The other day it was carrying off a 

3002
02:07:54,180 --> 02:07:57,441
fallen.
Did you know that hogs carry off fond 

3003
02:07:57,441 --> 02:07:57,441
and kill a medium?
Yeah.

3004
02:07:57,441 --> 02:07:57,530
Yeah.
that was.

3005
02:07:57,640 --> 02:07:58,950
That was a wart hog.
No,

3006
02:07:58,951 --> 02:08:00,070
it wasn't really.
no.

3007
02:08:00,071 --> 02:08:03,940
it was a pig.
There was a american domestic hog.

3008
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:08,970
that's pig.
Man has got a patch on his eye because 

3009
02:08:08,970 --> 02:08:11,251
he was in a fucking car accident.
He got all fucked up and now he's going 

3010
02:08:11,251 --> 02:08:11,251
to shoot his bow with his left.
Nice.

3011
02:08:11,251 --> 02:08:13,270
Taking the anger from losing his eye on 
the pigs.

3012
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:15,250
No,
he's always been a pig murderer.

3013
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:17,680
I mean he looked in.
If you live in Texas,

3014
02:08:17,681 --> 02:08:18,650
you got to kill pigs.

3015
02:08:18,650 --> 02:08:20,290
It's hard to kill pigs.
Yes.

3016
02:08:20,410 --> 02:08:21,910
You got to find them.
First of all.

3017
02:08:21,911 --> 02:08:25,060
I mean they're.
They're massively invasive.

3018
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:30,090
There's millions of them.
I mean fucking million just taking 

3019
02:08:30,090 --> 02:08:31,480
machine data alone.
In Texas alone,

3020
02:08:31,481 --> 02:08:33,480
there are millions of wild hogs.
Oh,

3021
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:35,890
it's so bad that Texas,
they opened up a road.

3022
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:38,770
Have they had built a new road and the 
night they open it up,

3023
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:41,620
they got liKe 40 car accidents where 
people were slamming into pigs.

3024
02:08:41,621 --> 02:08:42,820
You know what?
Tim kennedy taught me this.

3025
02:08:42,821 --> 02:08:44,380
He said in Texas,
pigs are real.

3026
02:08:44,381 --> 02:08:46,660
He gets on horseback and hudson was 
spear.

3027
02:08:46,661 --> 02:08:51,661
how about the fact that with fucking 
helicopters wanted to see something 

3028
02:08:51,661 --> 02:08:55,741
crazy west.
This pull up pigman and ted nugent hunt 

3029
02:08:55,741 --> 02:08:59,920
pigs with a helicopter.
They have episodes they call a pork lips

3030
02:08:59,921 --> 02:09:04,921
now and they fucking fly around 
attendance outside hunting.

3031
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:07,300
You.
No,

3032
02:09:07,301 --> 02:09:08,930
it's massacre.
Instead,

3033
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:10,150
it should be illegal not to do.

3034
02:09:10,260 --> 02:09:11,380
Yes.
Yeah,

3035
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:13,720
it's a massacre,
but that's what they have to do.

3036
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:14,380
Like,
look,

3037
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:16,870
there are things that you have to do if 
you want to,

3038
02:09:16,871 --> 02:09:20,410
if everybody has this idea that nature 
balances itself out,

3039
02:09:20,411 --> 02:09:25,411
but the problem with that idea is in 90 
percent of everything that's ever 

3040
02:09:25,411 --> 02:09:25,570
existed ever is extinct.
Ninety percent.

3041
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:29,950
So all of those fucking animals that 
weren't helped along,

3042
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:31,780
like,
you know,

3043
02:09:31,870 --> 02:09:36,870
I mean there's,
there's a real big problem with bears 

3044
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:39,580
and deer and moose populations because 
bear and wolves,

3045
02:09:39,581 --> 02:09:44,581
especially to now in the places where 
wolves have been reintroduced because 

3046
02:09:44,581 --> 02:09:45,340
wolves give birth to a litter,
right?

3047
02:09:45,341 --> 02:09:47,550
So if a wolf pop,
you know,

3048
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:52,570
if a wolf mom has like six babies,
a moose only has one baby.

3049
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:57,840
So the moose has one baby and then 
there's this fucking wolf running around

3050
02:09:58,181 --> 02:10:00,940
with six pups.
Well the just do the math,

3051
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:02,050
you know,
they're gonna,

3052
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:05,800
they're gonna slowly but surely start 
taking out all of the,

3053
02:10:05,801 --> 02:10:07,030
uh,
the game animals.

3054
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:12,030
And that's what's happening in a lot of 
states where they've reintroduced wolf 

3055
02:10:13,061 --> 02:10:14,430
hunting too.
A lot of states now.

3056
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:15,490
And bears.
Oh,

3057
02:10:15,491 --> 02:10:16,890
bears have always been hunted.
What?

3058
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:19,360
You have to have like a knife,
kodiak bears,

3059
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:24,900
mountain lions,
you have to hunt things that don't have 

3060
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:24,900
a predator because if they don't have a 
predator,

3061
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:26,060
the nothing controls.
They're popular.

3062
02:10:26,061 --> 02:10:27,550
Great white sharks or what?
Well,

3063
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:29,680
great white sharks try to hit those next
day.

3064
02:10:29,690 --> 02:10:30,950
They clean shit up,
dude.

3065
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,120
Look at him.
Hang that,

3066
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:34,430
but that's what that says.
If an ad,

3067
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:38,210
there's actual episodes where you could 
see going down these little pigs.

3068
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:40,060
That's a.
That was a pork.

3069
02:10:40,061 --> 02:10:42,880
Lips was a night on sportsman channel.
They,

3070
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:48,500
yeah,
they kill everything on the pork lips 

3071
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:50,411
now,
but they Just leave to point being this 

3072
02:10:50,411 --> 02:10:54,251
guy's dad pigments.
Dad shoots pigs in the head all the 

3073
02:10:54,251 --> 02:10:54,251
time.
Not only shoot them execution style,

3074
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:55,340
but way crazier.

3075
02:10:55,670 --> 02:11:00,410
What he does is he'll line corn up on 
the road like a row of corn,

3076
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:05,470
like maybe like several yards long and 
then they get down there because it's a 

3077
02:11:05,470 --> 02:11:09,731
line.
They get down there to eat in the line 

3078
02:11:09,731 --> 02:11:10,840
and then he gets their heads lined up so
when it gets to the headline deaf,

3079
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:15,860
he'll shoot through three of them with 
one bullet and he's always trying to 

3080
02:11:15,860 --> 02:11:18,941
kill as many pigs as he can with one 
bullet to the head and it's crazy but 

3081
02:11:20,050 --> 02:11:22,850
it's fucked up.
But theY do have to kill these things.

3082
02:11:22,910 --> 02:11:23,780
So like,
look,

3083
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:25,760
if you can kill one by shooting in the 
head,

3084
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:27,830
that is the best way to do it.
And some people like,

3085
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:29,180
no,
you sHouldn't do it,

3086
02:11:29,181 --> 02:11:30,020
man.
You shouldn't kill.

3087
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:30,680
Well,
okay,

3088
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:31,940
well then they're going to eat 
everything.

3089
02:11:32,030 --> 02:11:33,830
They're going to eat all the ground 
nesting birds.

3090
02:11:33,831 --> 02:11:35,660
When you.
First of all,

3091
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:40,400
jane would google how many pigs we 
slaughter a day in this country.

3092
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:43,640
That number.
You're talking about domestic.

3093
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:49,190
That's avoidable because you don't have 
to have farming,

3094
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:54,220
right?
You don't have to have factory farm and 

3095
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:54,220
you to feed that many people.
You do.

3096
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:55,850
My point is that we're talking about two
completely different issues.

3097
02:11:55,851 --> 02:12:00,650
My point is if you let these wild hogs 
go nuts and just keep breeding,

3098
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:04,520
they're having three litters a year,
sometimes really bad.

3099
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:07,640
And each one of them is like six to 
eight fucking babies.

3100
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:11,630
500 hogs and pigs and they run fast for 
the fastest shit.

3101
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:13,010
And they know what's going on.
Man.

3102
02:12:13,011 --> 02:12:14,250
They're smart.
Wow.

3103
02:12:14,390 --> 02:12:15,440
They're here.
These pop pop,

3104
02:12:15,441 --> 02:12:17,000
pop.
And they watched their friends explode.

3105
02:12:17,001 --> 02:12:18,860
They're not stupid.
Damn.

3106
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:21,980
But I don't know doug.
They're very smart.

3107
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:24,620
They're very smart.
It depends on who's run though.

3108
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:27,320
I'm impressed with how fast they run.
It's a wild animal,

3109
02:12:27,321 --> 02:12:27,800
brian.
Yeah.

3110
02:12:28,150 --> 02:12:29,690
No,
that's terrified for his life,

3111
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:32,630
but the question is if you don't do 
this,

3112
02:12:32,631 --> 02:12:34,190
okay,
if you don't shoot them,

3113
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:35,840
what do you do?

3114
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:38,390
Do you just let them like what is the 
vegan response?

3115
02:12:38,391 --> 02:12:40,940
What is the animal rights response?
Build a wall for him.

3116
02:12:41,250 --> 02:12:42,380
What do you do?
You've got to can't.

3117
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:44,540
You can't,
but you can't have a white one.

3118
02:12:44,541 --> 02:12:46,280
You son of a bitch.
Well,

3119
02:12:46,281 --> 02:12:49,040
there's a lot of.
These are domestic pigs that get loose.

3120
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:51,440
I'm so impressed with how fast they run.
They bound.

3121
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:53,030
Yeah,
they're fast as fuck.

3122
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:54,860
And by the way,
this ain't easy to hit these fuckers.

3123
02:12:54,861 --> 02:12:57,560
I love how they run and zigzag.
Yeah.

3124
02:12:57,590 --> 02:12:58,730
Fuck yeah,
they're smart.

3125
02:12:59,110 --> 02:13:00,560
They're trying.
Good shot though.

3126
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:02,250
I forgot.
Not a magnet.

3127
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:07,300
Right?
WeLl you definitely have to be a good 

3128
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:07,300
shot.
You're still.

3129
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:09,310
I mean guys miss on the show.
All the halo is a killer.

3130
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:10,550
No,
For real.

3131
02:13:10,580 --> 02:13:13,100
I feel like it'd be all right.
Call of duty and shit.

3132
02:13:13,101 --> 02:13:13,850
Dude.
Who did?

3133
02:13:13,851 --> 02:13:18,851
They have kids now who are 16 years old 
because they've been playing for the 

3134
02:13:18,851 --> 02:13:19,130
against and there were three.
You give them a couple of adjustments.

3135
02:13:19,131 --> 02:13:20,720
They're shooting as well as they swat 
guy.

3136
02:13:21,370 --> 02:13:26,370
They get used to pulling triggers.
Those first person shooter as a 

3137
02:13:26,370 --> 02:13:29,930
motherfucker.
All these fucks when they go into the 

3138
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:30,050
theater shooting,
they'll fucking practice on the kids who

3139
02:13:30,051 --> 02:13:32,130
are expert.
They get used

3140
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:34,950
to Leading to get used to doing all 
kinds of different things.

3141
02:13:34,970 --> 02:13:37,020
on.
This one kid was 16 and he was hitting.

3142
02:13:37,021 --> 02:13:38,490
He was,
he was headshots bang,

3143
02:13:38,491 --> 02:13:38,780
bang,
bang,

3144
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:39,970
bang,
and they.

3145
02:13:40,030 --> 02:13:41,700
At first it was kind of missing a little
knick game,

3146
02:13:41,701 --> 02:13:45,780
a couple of adjustments because it was a
real gun and then in an afternoon he was

3147
02:13:45,781 --> 02:13:48,240
shooting as well as the expert.
The expert marksman.

3148
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:53,510
Kids play a little too much.
video games he'd been playing since he 

3149
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:53,510
was three.
He was.

3150
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:54,450
He was saying,
that's so insane.

3151
02:13:54,451 --> 02:13:58,320
If you think about how what they can do 
now in comparison,

3152
02:13:58,330 --> 02:14:01,110
like think about what they used to be 
able to do 20 years ago,

3153
02:14:01,230 --> 02:14:06,230
what they can do now and then what 
they're going to be able to do 20 years 

3154
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:06,230
video games.
I'm talking about controlled fighters.

3155
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:09,870
Fighters are going to have like an 
ability to fight like a virtual reality,

3156
02:14:09,871 --> 02:14:12,150
kind of moving their head and seeing the
shots come.

3157
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:14,010
Here's one thing for sure is gonna 
happen.

3158
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:16,800
We're going to have some I.
Robot type assassins.

3159
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:22,140
One hundred percent.
We're going to release those on 

3160
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:22,140
Afghanistan and we're never going to 
have another casualty.

3161
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:26,070
I mean if also going to release so well,
that's the problem.

3162
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:28,800
Yeah.
Suicide bombers now to fucking I robe.

3163
02:14:28,801 --> 02:14:31,020
Others walking down to the miami 
dolphins stadium.

3164
02:14:31,810 --> 02:14:33,060
Oh,
that's the worry.

3165
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:37,080
That one's for frisia chore ahead 
technologically,

3166
02:14:37,090 --> 02:14:40,250
but for a little bit.
China begs to differ.

3167
02:14:41,070 --> 02:14:42,100
Korea.
Well,

3168
02:14:42,101 --> 02:14:44,070
I'm going to see that thing come from a 
mile away thing.

3169
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:49,430
I think the next generation,
this thing has a battery power on its 

3170
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:50,850
back that it stole from a tesla and it's
running around.

3171
02:14:50,851 --> 02:14:53,280
We'll go ahead and run behind that thing
and yanked the cord out.

3172
02:14:53,310 --> 02:14:56,250
I'm not afraid of.
It's going to know you're running behind

3173
02:14:56,251 --> 02:15:01,251
it because it has cameras everywhere.
Just like a tesla looking just like a 

3174
02:15:01,251 --> 02:15:01,251
test.

3175
02:15:01,251 --> 02:15:02,100
That's how tesla.
This is insane though.

3176
02:15:02,101 --> 02:15:07,101
This is weird to watch.
I know this thing walking around what 

3177
02:15:07,101 --> 02:15:07,860
you feel like you just run up and 
fucking Bruce Lee kicking it fall over.

3178
02:15:08,210 --> 02:15:10,920
It can see you come and I would assume 
it has cameras everywhere.

3179
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:15,950
Why wouldn't you put cameras three and 
an associate degrees on one of these 

3180
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:15,950
fucking things?
It's picking up a box.

3181
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:16,410
Ooh,
it bends over correctly.

3182
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:21,890
Nice posh.
The guys slap and tries to knock them 

3183
02:15:21,890 --> 02:15:21,890
off.
Balance.

3184
02:15:23,170 --> 02:15:24,310
Let me spinning back.
Kick that.

3185
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:27,590
Let me fucking yank him from the back.
I'll just.

3186
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:30,630
I'll just sand chai trip.
I'm just get them into the collar tie.

3187
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:33,310
Just fuck.
Let me go and get those legs out.

3188
02:15:33,390 --> 02:15:36,150
This is the future.
This is the future.

3189
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:41,420
Hope.
Hopefully it's a little more 

3190
02:15:41,420 --> 02:15:42,441
aerodynamic.
This guy keeps fucking with the robot 

3191
02:15:42,441 --> 02:15:45,130
flux.
This steve jobs came around that it's 

3192
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:45,130
going to chase after the package.

3193
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:45,660
She's.
Why doesn't he get mad at the guy with a

3194
02:15:45,661 --> 02:15:48,380
stick and he slapped the guy with the.
A kind of what?

3195
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:49,590
I'm looking for,
robot.

3196
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:54,700
Well,
if you guys paid attention to this go 

3197
02:15:54,700 --> 02:15:54,700
thing.
No.

3198
02:15:54,700 --> 02:15:57,350
Well,
for the first time google's ai has been 

3199
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:59,040
able to beat the best go players in the 
world that we're talking about.

3200
02:15:59,041 --> 02:16:00,540
Your role up behind him and fucking push
his.

3201
02:16:00,541 --> 02:16:02,130
Sorry ass over to.
Let's see.

3202
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:04,490
Get back to q robot now.
Let's see.

3203
02:16:04,491 --> 02:16:09,491
I it gets bad,
but I'm yanking cord that once it gets 

3204
02:16:09,491 --> 02:16:09,491
down to this,
almost fake,

3205
02:16:09,491 --> 02:16:10,110
that the way it's getting up.
Whoa.

3206
02:16:10,111 --> 02:16:15,111
I don't like that.
It looks like it looks like robocop in 

3207
02:16:15,111 --> 02:16:16,320
1988 skinny.
It doesn't even bother defending itself.

3208
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,050
This is just the prototype,
right?

3209
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:24,360
When we're looking at something that's 
going to one day be like a brendan 

3210
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:24,870
schaub or brian count,
you're not even to be able to tell,

3211
02:16:26,410 --> 02:16:28,740
so anyway,
the google artificial intelligence,

3212
02:16:28,741 --> 02:16:30,150
the ai for the first time,

3213
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:32,290
it's been able to beat the best player 
in the world,

3214
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:37,291
a human being at go and go,
which is exponentially more difficult 

3215
02:16:37,291 --> 02:16:41,821
than chess.
It's a super complicated game aNd not 

3216
02:16:41,821 --> 02:16:43,840
only these these ai systems to say this 
google ai system,

3217
02:16:43,841 --> 02:16:46,030
able to beat the best player in the 
world,

3218
02:16:46,031 --> 02:16:51,031
but it's doing it and some really 
creative ways that are freaking people 

3219
02:16:51,031 --> 02:16:51,610
out because they're trying to figure out
how these,

3220
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:56,670
these fucking games,
how these artificial intelligence 

3221
02:16:56,670 --> 02:16:57,550
programs are learning these games so 
well.

3222
02:16:57,730 --> 02:17:00,820
They thought it Was going to be years 
before one could be to player,

3223
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:06,120
like a real world class top of the food 
chain at dartmouth for not knowing this 

3224
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:07,950
game.
I'm not knowingly said,

3225
02:17:07,951 --> 02:17:12,951
dog,
you could make up the rules and I'd be 

3226
02:17:12,951 --> 02:17:12,951
like,
okay,

3227
02:17:12,951 --> 02:17:12,951
I've.
I've played.

3228
02:17:12,951 --> 02:17:16,080
I was playing a sorry with my kids the 
other day and they were totally making 

3229
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:16,080
up roll.

3230
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:17,160
I could tell.
I was like,

3231
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:21,490
definitely not go to reach for the 
fucking instructions.

3232
02:17:21,491 --> 02:17:26,190
She grabs my hand.
oh daddy this at the beginning.

3233
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:29,650
Creative getting creative.
our kids are gonna.

3234
02:17:29,651 --> 02:17:34,651
Grow up with.
I started that new tesla suv because 

3235
02:17:34,651 --> 02:17:37,800
will smith's son had it at erewhon.
He's got a name dropper that erewhon 

3236
02:17:39,701 --> 02:17:40,450
okay,
we get it.

3237
02:17:40,451 --> 02:17:45,451
You're in calabasas.
I got to spend that karate kid money 

3238
02:17:45,451 --> 02:17:46,990
somewhere.
That's word god damn right.

3239
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:49,660
I'm going to start a cult someday.
Yes or no.

3240
02:17:49,770 --> 02:17:50,680
Oh,
wellsmith.

3241
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:51,730
Either one.
Him his son.

3242
02:17:51,830 --> 02:17:56,830
Anyone like that?
Anyone to disappeared and he also 

3243
02:17:56,830 --> 02:17:56,830
doesn't see a difference in women and 
men's clothing because when I read,

3244
02:17:56,830 --> 02:17:58,210
well there is no gender.
It's not real.

3245
02:17:58,540 --> 02:18:01,720
It doesn't even know that you know that 
gender says this as no more.

3246
02:18:01,750 --> 02:18:06,750
Cte will.
Smith will all bathrooms should just do 

3247
02:18:06,750 --> 02:18:06,750
this.
Look,

3248
02:18:06,750 --> 02:18:07,250
I'll tell you that much.

3249
02:18:07,540 --> 02:18:08,530
Oh,
you want equal rights?

3250
02:18:08,531 --> 02:18:09,520
Good.
And show the bathroom.

3251
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:10,280
Yeah,
share the bad.

3252
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:15,960
A good looking kid though.
I don't see man clothes and woman 

3253
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:15,960
closed.
Well,

3254
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:15,960
you need to get classes because they're 
very different.

3255
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:19,000
Girls wear skirts,
pitch combat boots and shit.

3256
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:21,060
Go and put some high heels on.
welcome.

3257
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:24,670
Listen,
if I was in this fucking kid's position,

3258
02:18:24,671 --> 02:18:29,671
I'd be saying way more stupid shit.
I'd be way weirder doing way more crazy 

3259
02:18:29,671 --> 02:18:29,671
shit.
Anybody,

3260
02:18:29,671 --> 02:18:32,380
anybody in that life like growing up 
with your parents?

3261
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:35,800
You grew up like a little prince.
I got good grades,

3262
02:18:35,850 --> 02:18:38,140
but even weirder because your dad is a 
professional.

3263
02:18:38,141 --> 02:18:41,800
Make believer.
Your dad is like just a guy who's really

3264
02:18:41,801 --> 02:18:44,170
good at pretending and he's world 
renowned.

3265
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:46,600
Everywhere you go.
You're flying on private jets.

3266
02:18:46,601 --> 02:18:48,810
Mom too.
She's famous as fuck.

3267
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:52,240
Did you see chris rock's bit about that 
classic,

3268
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:53,550
about jayda?
What did,

3269
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:58,560
what did he say?
He say he's like jada pinkett protesting

3270
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:01,960
at the oscars.
Is main testing outside of beyonce?

3271
02:19:01,961 --> 02:19:06,730
Is posy not invited?
I was not invited.

3272
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:13,740
That great joke.
Perfect actor for almoSt fucking it up 

3273
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:15,780
though.
Like,

3274
02:19:15,781 --> 02:19:17,410
are you chimed in the middle of me?
Sorry.

3275
02:19:17,411 --> 02:19:18,970
Sorry.
I was trying to get for the timing.

3276
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:20,560
Uh,
who was the other guy?

3277
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:22,380
The other black actor who,
who,

3278
02:19:22,660 --> 02:19:25,280
who tweeted hey rianna act.
I mean,

3279
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:27,070
hey janet,
act better.

3280
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:28,040
I was like,

3281
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:29,330
oh geez man,
I can't.

3282
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:30,110
Oh,
did they really?

3283
02:19:30,111 --> 02:19:31,100
Yeah,
that's good.

3284
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:32,360
Do you want to get favor with the 
academy?

3285
02:19:32,361 --> 02:19:37,361
That's the way to go.
What did you think about that whole 

3286
02:19:37,361 --> 02:19:37,361
oscar?
So white.

3287
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:39,080
Well,
you want my answer?

3288
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:43,160
Yes please.
More wrestling or whenever something.

3289
02:19:43,650 --> 02:19:44,770
Yeah.
Whatever.

3290
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:49,780
Something bothers me.
I'm usually kind of Write about it in a 

3291
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:52,661
way like where I go,
why I know the message is important and 

3292
02:19:52,661 --> 02:19:55,190
I obviously am not prejudice and I want 
everybody to be equal.

3293
02:19:56,390 --> 02:20:01,390
I think I resent when people cram it 
down my throat and try to shame me or 

3294
02:20:01,390 --> 02:20:01,640
scold me,
which I felt like the outskirts.

3295
02:20:01,641 --> 02:20:03,200
We're doing a little bit.
They did it.

3296
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:08,260
They did a good job,
I think of kind of taking the piss out 

3297
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:08,260
of it,
you know,

3298
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:08,260
making it,
come on,

3299
02:20:08,260 --> 02:20:08,890
we're off,
blah blah blah.

3300
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:10,790
Chris rock did a good job with what he 
had.

3301
02:20:11,270 --> 02:20:13,010
But um,
I always feel like when,

3302
02:20:13,011 --> 02:20:18,011
when,
when joe biden tAlked about consent and 

3303
02:20:18,011 --> 02:20:21,440
when a lady gaga got up and sang that 
song about victims of sexual abuse,

3304
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:22,970
like,
I get it,

3305
02:20:23,030 --> 02:20:28,030
I'm with you.
I'm not pro rape but rape someone 

3306
02:20:28,030 --> 02:20:31,140
because of a lady gaga song,
like you not to re.

3307
02:20:31,370 --> 02:20:32,980
Matter of fact,
it made me more angry,

3308
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:36,830
know what to write.
I feel like that's what I,

3309
02:20:36,831 --> 02:20:41,831
you know,
you feel like you're being manipulated 

3310
02:20:41,831 --> 02:20:42,260
and demonized you.
not only that,

3311
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:47,300
it's a,
it's a manipulation where I already 

3312
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:49,790
agree with you,
so it's all racism is bad for telling me

3313
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:50,480
something.
I don't know.

3314
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:53,440
Sexual assault,
it's bad takes.

3315
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:56,220
Lady gaga told me that because I was 
about to go.

3316
02:20:56,230 --> 02:20:58,910
Right.
Thank god you stand.

3317
02:20:58,911 --> 02:21:00,680
You know what?
But it's not real.

3318
02:21:00,681 --> 02:21:03,290
It's social virtue.
It's virtue signaling.

3319
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:08,980
Michael shermer calls.
But let me be devil's advocate for a 

3320
02:21:08,980 --> 02:21:08,980
second.

3321
02:21:08,980 --> 02:21:09,480
that definitely devil's advocate.
You that.

3322
02:21:09,710 --> 02:21:12,210
Can you advocate,
I can advocate for the devil.

3323
02:21:12,490 --> 02:21:14,150
Uh,
there iS,

3324
02:21:14,210 --> 02:21:17,750
there.
I do understand the idea that if you are

3325
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:20,510
sam smith and you say,
hey,

3326
02:21:20,511 --> 02:21:24,200
this is for all the lgbt people out 
there or if you are lady gaga,

3327
02:21:24,201 --> 02:21:25,730
lgbt,
lgbt,

3328
02:21:25,740 --> 02:21:26,190
lgbt.
what?

3329
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:31,200
I forgot the gate house tear by all I 
see guys don't see gay.

3330
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:34,350
No,
I have to exclude that.

3331
02:21:34,370 --> 02:21:35,910
You see women's clothing,
men's clothing.

3332
02:21:35,940 --> 02:21:37,550
Don't do it.
I'm just so colorblind.

3333
02:21:38,330 --> 02:21:39,740
I don't know if you guys or girls or 
boys.

3334
02:21:40,730 --> 02:21:44,090
Do you have a front hole or front?
Let me check.

3335
02:21:44,430 --> 02:21:45,580
There it is.
But uh,

3336
02:21:46,190 --> 02:21:47,990
what was I saying?
Something really profound,

3337
02:21:47,991 --> 02:21:49,070
but,
but this is my thing.

3338
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:52,300
Job,
just while you're thinking,

3339
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:55,200
I'll tell you what will,
what will we do?

3340
02:21:55,201 --> 02:21:56,930
I think you were getting.
You were saying that.

3341
02:21:57,580 --> 02:22:02,000
I don't know what you're saying.
If someone says something there,

3342
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:05,090
I do think that there is a place to say,
hey,

3343
02:22:05,091 --> 02:22:08,360
if you are a victim out there,
if you're a transgender kid and you were

3344
02:22:08,361 --> 02:22:10,670
thinking about killing yourself,
there is value.

3345
02:22:10,671 --> 02:22:12,890
There's value to seeing really cool 
people,

3346
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,500
actors that you look up to saying,
hey dude,

3347
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:20,620
it's okay.
You're not a freak or it's okay to be 

3348
02:22:20,620 --> 02:22:22,220
who you are because that's the truth of 
who you are and feel empowered.

3349
02:22:22,221 --> 02:22:27,221
Like I get that.
I can't wait until it's no longer an 

3350
02:22:27,221 --> 02:22:27,221
issue so then we can start

3351
02:22:27,221 --> 02:22:29,820
figuring out which one of these 
transgender people are just dummies that

3352
02:22:29,821 --> 02:22:34,821
happened to be transgender.
which one of these gay people are just 

3353
02:22:34,821 --> 02:22:37,700
dummies and happened to be gay.
Like there's a lot of that where people 

3354
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:38,730
get free rides just because from a 
marginalized group,

3355
02:22:38,731 --> 02:22:41,910
it's not just that they're annoying and 
they're a part of this whole thing,

3356
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:45,960
like a hundred percent.
A lot of the real de is just coming from

3357
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:48,440
dummies that support a great cause and 
they get.

3358
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:52,950
They have a big problem with the whole 
social justice warrior movement is it?

3359
02:22:52,951 --> 02:22:55,740
A lot of it is just really fucked up 
socially,

3360
02:22:55,950 --> 02:22:58,710
socially retarded people and those 
people,

3361
02:22:59,010 --> 02:23:02,250
those people have found an area in which
if you,

3362
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:07,280
if you support this area,
you can be the biggest con in the world 

3363
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:11,450
supporting that area.
You could be fucking horrendous to 

3364
02:23:11,450 --> 02:23:11,490
people,
rude to people,

3365
02:23:11,491 --> 02:23:15,270
try to destroy people's lives as long as
you're doing within the confines and the

3366
02:23:15,271 --> 02:23:20,271
parameters of that cost and I don't buy 
it because I think that those are just 

3367
02:23:20,271 --> 02:23:20,271
terrible people.

3368
02:23:20,271 --> 02:23:23,730
Meeting those people are will people 
that found a good cause to be specific?

3369
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:25,100
Specific.
I don't know.

3370
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:30,830
You can call them terrible people.
I think people like that are Way less 

3371
02:23:30,830 --> 02:23:32,280
interested in the actual cause.
They're way more Interested in power.

3372
02:23:32,590 --> 02:23:35,560
You said that you see people who,
the,

3373
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:37,430
you know,
whether they're in greenpeace,

3374
02:23:37,450 --> 02:23:39,450
whatever,
they just are not satisfied with winning

3375
02:23:39,451 --> 02:23:44,451
a victory.
They are more interested in never 

3376
02:23:44,451 --> 02:23:44,451
demonizing and controlling.
Another group of.

3377
02:23:44,451 --> 02:23:47,130
I also think going back to the oscars,
yes,

3378
02:23:47,131 --> 02:23:52,131
there is no black people nominated.
Could it just be that all the white 

3379
02:23:52,231 --> 02:23:55,530
people had great movies that year?
Maybe the blood in the.

3380
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:57,660
They never got the major roles,
which is an issue,

3381
02:23:57,780 --> 02:24:00,870
but it just so happens this year.
All the great movies,

3382
02:24:00,871 --> 02:24:03,980
all the great actors happen to be white,
so you just chalk it up as race.

3383
02:24:04,580 --> 02:24:08,370
It's a clever move though,
because we're to hollywood.

3384
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:13,430
there's such pussies that once you do 
have protests like this and say oscars 

3385
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:15,900
so white,
they're gonna fucking panic now.

3386
02:24:16,220 --> 02:24:17,990
Black.
Oh well everyone,

3387
02:24:18,390 --> 02:24:19,200
what they're.
What?

3388
02:24:19,201 --> 02:24:22,650
They're going to like the type of movies
that are going to get made.

3389
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:25,500
They're going to try to make movies for 
highly perry's like,

3390
02:24:26,290 --> 02:24:27,270
no,
that's not gonna work,

3391
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:32,070
but that they're going to try to make 
really diversity oriented movies.

3392
02:24:33,270 --> 02:24:34,140
Of course.
Yeah,

3393
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:34,890
it's,
but it's,

3394
02:24:35,010 --> 02:24:38,370
it's all artificial.
So this is like an adolescent stage,

3395
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:41,400
so we'll get to that stage and then 
It'll just be quality.

3396
02:24:41,401 --> 02:24:46,401
Like there's no denying denzel 
washington's one of the greatest actors 

3397
02:24:46,401 --> 02:24:46,860
of all time.
you don't give a fuck if he's black.

3398
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:49,880
He's white.
He's fucking spectacular.

3399
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,910
Robert downey jr.
When he went blackface.

3400
02:24:51,930 --> 02:24:54,600
Still great.
Don't remember that.

3401
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:56,580
shouldn't even talk.
You can't do that today.

3402
02:24:56,860 --> 02:24:58,410
You're creating controversy.
Tropic thunder.

3403
02:24:58,410 --> 02:25:00,180
If you tried to do that today,
you could do it.

3404
02:25:00,330 --> 02:25:05,330
He kept saying he was trying to forgot.
he did that and he was really amazing 

3405
02:25:05,330 --> 02:25:07,650
because you can't do that to never go 
full retard.

3406
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:09,690
some of the greatest lines and 
everything.

3407
02:25:09,691 --> 02:25:11,310
And then he moved.
It was brilliant.

3408
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:13,560
funny fucking movie,
man.

3409
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:15,000
Great man.
Eddie bravo and I were just.

3410
02:25:15,030 --> 02:25:17,280
We were just talking about on the 
companion.

3411
02:25:17,281 --> 02:25:17,570
yeah,
yeah,

3412
02:25:17,580 --> 02:25:18,450
yeah,
yeah,

3413
02:25:18,451 --> 02:25:19,570
that's right.
You can use so good.

3414
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:21,810
I've talked about that movie like 10 
times over.

3415
02:25:21,811 --> 02:25:25,000
The last two is a spectacular movie that
you couldn't make it.

3416
02:25:25,010 --> 02:25:28,270
All I'm saying is it doesn't matter if 
robert junior plays black guy,

3417
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:29,850
white guy.
he's a brilliant man.

3418
02:25:29,890 --> 02:25:31,720
Still play a chinese guy.
Could you still.

3419
02:25:31,721 --> 02:25:34,420
Do you remember when they used to.
What was the charlie chan?

3420
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:39,600
Charlie chan was a white guy that they 
pretend this child things you could and 

3421
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:39,600
I'll tell you something else.

3422
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:43,020
He dressed up like a native american and
we instagrammed a picture for this 

3423
02:25:43,020 --> 02:25:46,551
sketch.
We're doing all these social justice 

3424
02:25:46,551 --> 02:25:46,900
from that and I answered some of them.
I was like,

3425
02:25:46,901 --> 02:25:49,570
listen man,
it's a misappropriation.

3426
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:52,750
Do I hope you know how ridiculous you 
look like,

3427
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:53,950
bitch,
you got a tesla.

3428
02:25:54,270 --> 02:25:55,990
What are you talking about?
You're not a real indian.

3429
02:25:55,991 --> 02:25:57,160
What are you talking about?
Yeah,

3430
02:25:57,161 --> 02:26:02,161
I saw there was one of the kardashians 
had a photo of her like in some native 

3431
02:26:02,161 --> 02:26:06,361
american outfit,
like a pocahontas type outfit for 

3432
02:26:06,361 --> 02:26:06,361
halloween.
It's hot.

3433
02:26:06,361 --> 02:26:09,930
Probably hot as fuck.
Just just fucking all the hate standing 

3434
02:26:14,711 --> 02:26:18,350
up,
standing up for any reason to stay.

3435
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:22,750
Fucking hate americans do not understand
what cultural misappropriation is.

3436
02:26:22,751 --> 02:26:24,160
You don't because you have whIte 
privilege.

3437
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:26,020
The k,
first of all,

3438
02:26:26,140 --> 02:26:28,060
you should just shut the fuck up and 
listen.

3439
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:30,550
This is a big thing,
a big thing that they like to do.

3440
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:33,750
If someone of color speaking,
shut the fuck up and listen.

3441
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:39,200
wow.
I am noble and I am progressive and I 

3442
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:40,950
want you to shut the fuck up and listen.
That's a big thing if some.

3443
02:26:40,970 --> 02:26:42,610
If a woman is talking about women's 
issues,

3444
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:45,400
how about we shut the fuck up guys?
How about you guys?

3445
02:26:45,401 --> 02:26:50,401
You men to shut the fuck up.
But the thing is posted the indian 

3446
02:26:50,401 --> 02:26:50,950
video.
You don't even know the context.

3447
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:54,520
So for you to jump on there and be like,
this is offensive bitch.

3448
02:26:54,521 --> 02:26:57,220
Your wife.
It was the traditional garb.

3449
02:26:57,221 --> 02:26:59,250
It actually was very historically 
accurate.

3450
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:01,990
It's fake as fuck.
Do you ever listen to the character?

3451
02:27:01,991 --> 02:27:03,540
Do you ever watch the youtube videos 
from the,

3452
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:05,290
uh,
the amazing atheist?

3453
02:27:05,470 --> 02:27:07,150
No.
Amazing atheist is great.

3454
02:27:07,151 --> 02:27:09,580
He's been on the podcast before too.
He's fucking great.

3455
02:27:09,581 --> 02:27:12,640
His videos are amazing and because he's 
amazing,

3456
02:27:12,850 --> 02:27:17,850
but he had one the other day about how 
feminists hate when you use the phrase,

3457
02:27:18,881 --> 02:27:23,881
not all men because they want you to 
somehow or another be guilty for the 

3458
02:27:23,881 --> 02:27:23,881
actions of all men.

3459
02:27:23,881 --> 02:27:24,780
So if guy say,
whoa,

3460
02:27:24,781 --> 02:27:26,080
whoa.
Not all men rape.

3461
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:28,180
Like I don't rape.
Stop saying all,

3462
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:29,670
stop categorizing.
All met,

3463
02:27:29,671 --> 02:27:31,300
which is fair.
Which is totally fair,

3464
02:27:31,490 --> 02:27:36,490
but he does this whole thing on this 
article at some woman who's a crazy 

3465
02:27:36,490 --> 02:27:37,270
feminist,
who by the way I went to her page,

3466
02:27:37,690 --> 02:27:42,690
I'm blocked.
I love what I don't even know I'm 

3467
02:27:42,690 --> 02:27:44,260
blocked in their twitter things.
Know that you,

3468
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:49,290
you use these block programs that 
anybody who might have any remotely 

3469
02:27:49,290 --> 02:27:51,710
controversial view really.
She's insular,

3470
02:27:52,030 --> 02:27:57,030
probably blocked to herself,
but his fucking video on it is 

3471
02:27:57,030 --> 02:28:01,051
sensational.
He does such a good job of covering all 

3472
02:28:01,051 --> 02:28:01,051
the points.
He's self deprecating.

3473
02:28:02,090 --> 02:28:04,720
Yeah.
It's a really good fucking points.

3474
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:09,950
And he's got a boat.
I've been on a binge watch some of his 

3475
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:09,950
videos lately.
He's actually,

3476
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:12,460
I'll watch them,
but this one like just skewers this,

3477
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:17,480
the feminist ideology that you're 
supposed to just feel guilty for the 

3478
02:28:17,480 --> 02:28:21,331
actions of men that have done horrible 
things when you haven't done a goddamn 

3479
02:28:21,331 --> 02:28:21,331
thing,
but it's like what it is.

3480
02:28:21,740 --> 02:28:22,010
They

3481
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:23,180
have this,
uh,

3482
02:28:23,190 --> 02:28:26,270
this ability to demonize and they don't 
want to lose it.

3483
02:28:26,470 --> 02:28:31,470
You know,
they can call up and they use to use 

3484
02:28:31,470 --> 02:28:32,030
fake statistics like one in four women 
like that.

3485
02:28:32,031 --> 02:28:34,060
Was that Christine Summers on your 
podcast,

3486
02:28:34,090 --> 02:28:37,880
but exponentially genders,
that gender study guy from Arizona,

3487
02:28:37,881 --> 02:28:42,881
I think a or a woman was from Arizona 
was I want to said that and she didn't 

3488
02:28:42,881 --> 02:28:43,970
have any.
It was a shotty experiment.

3489
02:28:43,971 --> 02:28:48,971
It was bullshit and it's also the 
redefined with sexual assault and rape 

3490
02:28:48,971 --> 02:28:50,330
isn't to include regret.
That's right.

3491
02:28:50,730 --> 02:28:55,730
Which is our alcohol.
If you've had sex while inebriated 

3492
02:28:55,730 --> 02:29:00,110
college band in that,
they've kind of abandoned that by the 

3493
02:29:00,110 --> 02:29:02,981
way,
but feminists were riding that hard to 

3494
02:29:02,981 --> 02:29:02,981
the point where feminists wrote a blog 
about it,

3495
02:29:02,981 --> 02:29:04,790
like if you have had sex while drunk,
you've raped somebody.

3496
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:09,820
I remember like theY were saying,
women don't have sex with your man if 

3497
02:29:09,820 --> 02:29:11,090
you're a man's drunk because he can't 
consent.

3498
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:12,380
Like,
listen,

3499
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:15,380
can I just sign a paper?
we could suck my dick when I'm drunk.

3500
02:29:15,430 --> 02:29:20,430
Yeah.
Is there anyone I can just text you can 

3501
02:29:20,430 --> 02:29:20,470
set right now.
Trust me.

3502
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:22,560
We're gonna Be okay.
Plus b,

3503
02:29:22,561 --> 02:29:25,130
I am ready to go.
I will say whatever you want.

3504
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:30,160
I would like to find the guy that has 
ever sued or taken a woman to court or 

3505
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:31,650
tried to call the cops because he was 
drunk.

3506
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:36,660
He had a girl fucked him.
I want to for a second how I want to 

3507
02:29:36,660 --> 02:29:37,460
find a job.
My friend there was a story.

3508
02:29:37,461 --> 02:29:40,760
A guy wrote an article I remember about 
10 years ago in the New York times.

3509
02:29:40,761 --> 02:29:45,761
Neat was talking about being a battered 
male and his girl,

3510
02:29:45,991 --> 02:29:48,060
but it does happen though.
Of course it does,

3511
02:29:48,090 --> 02:29:51,380
but he went to the cops three times and 
the cops were like this.

3512
02:29:51,381 --> 02:29:52,100
They were like,
uh,

3513
02:29:52,550 --> 02:29:53,030
man up.

3514
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:54,280
They were like,
they were like,

3515
02:29:54,290 --> 02:29:56,750
they would all snickers this in New York
city.

3516
02:29:56,751 --> 02:29:57,650
Yeah.
Go New York.

3517
02:29:58,610 --> 02:30:00,740
Bullied by.
Funny is.

3518
02:30:00,741 --> 02:30:03,830
That was one of the subjects that the 
amazing atheist is named tj.

3519
02:30:03,930 --> 02:30:08,930
One of the things that he brought up was
that he used to work with this woman 

3520
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:11,771
who's to sexually assault them.
They can teach us like a big sort of 

3521
02:30:11,771 --> 02:30:15,311
like outside of doing his youtube videos
is kind of an introverted guy a little 

3522
02:30:15,741 --> 02:30:20,240
bit and he worked at this place and this
woman who was an older woman and she was

3523
02:30:20,241 --> 02:30:25,241
his boss,
she was always grabbing his ass and 

3524
02:30:25,241 --> 02:30:27,970
fucking with them.
She's a funny when it happens to a guy 

3525
02:30:27,970 --> 02:30:29,390
happens a girl.
It's terrible for a guy to me.

3526
02:30:29,391 --> 02:30:31,220
It's hilarious.
He wants to get off bro.

3527
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:32,990
Hey,
sugar tits once you get over here.

3528
02:30:32,991 --> 02:30:34,020
to me,
that's hilarious.

3529
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:37,550
I know there was nothing she could do to
him that I would press your heart son.

3530
02:30:37,550 --> 02:30:38,690
Yeah,
I don't.

3531
02:30:38,810 --> 02:30:43,490
I'm confused.
We'll deal with it bro.

3532
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:45,660
I'm confused.
Up,

3533
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:50,780
confused.
There's so much confusion with so many 

3534
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:53,891
of these subjects.
When I was 14 of an older woman took 

3535
02:30:53,891 --> 02:30:54,350
advantage of me.
I would have been a.

3536
02:30:54,351 --> 02:30:55,100
Okay.
Yeah,

3537
02:30:55,101 --> 02:30:57,170
but if she was your boss and she was 
gross.

3538
02:30:57,640 --> 02:30:59,810
If she was your boss and she was gross 
and I think he was.

3539
02:30:59,890 --> 02:31:01,370
Well,
I think it was a young guy.

3540
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:02,510
Suck it up.
Yeah,

3541
02:31:02,511 --> 02:31:07,511
but you're a different guy too.
Like if you're like an emotionally less 

3542
02:31:07,511 --> 02:31:07,511
introverted.
Yeah,

3543
02:31:07,511 --> 02:31:09,530
more introverted,
a little different for women,

3544
02:31:09,531 --> 02:31:11,810
men guys stronger.
The guy could be inside your body.

3545
02:31:11,811 --> 02:31:14,110
It's a thousand dollars.
Not going to hold them,

3546
02:31:14,111 --> 02:31:17,030
no doubt,
but it's like saying murderer is,

3547
02:31:17,031 --> 02:31:19,920
is really bad,
so don't go.

3548
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:20,150
I mean

3549
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:22,140
if someone punches someone that's no big
deal,

3550
02:31:22,410 --> 02:31:27,410
but it is like getting knocked out as 
not as bad as getting stabbed and 

3551
02:31:27,410 --> 02:31:27,900
murdered,
but it's still not good for you.

3552
02:31:28,170 --> 02:31:32,040
So like his position of being sexually 
assaulted by a woman is not as bad as an

3553
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:33,270
ally.
That's reversed.

3554
02:31:33,430 --> 02:31:38,430
It's fucked up and it is weird,
but it's hilarious to meet with him at 

3555
02:31:38,611 --> 02:31:43,611
night,
dreading going into work and be locked 

3556
02:31:43,611 --> 02:31:44,610
in a fucking sugar dick and just paratha
them nonstop.

3557
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:49,880
What's even more funny as you being 
callous about this with a mouthful of 

3558
02:31:49,880 --> 02:31:50,610
elk,
she would've downed mocking this guy.

3559
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:54,630
How dare you take.
It's fucking funny.

3560
02:31:55,020 --> 02:31:57,220
Come on pussy.
It is.

3561
02:31:57,270 --> 02:32:02,270
It is weird.
And the other thing that's weird is 

3562
02:32:02,270 --> 02:32:04,101
like,
I don't have any sympathy for these 

3563
02:32:04,101 --> 02:32:04,620
fucking 16 year old kids were the 
teacher blows them when they get in gang

3564
02:32:04,621 --> 02:32:04,910
bangs.

3565
02:32:05,010 --> 02:32:08,830
The teacher in school this,
you'll be fine hills.

3566
02:32:08,850 --> 02:32:13,850
Where was my dick psa?
THe real problem was one pussy that 

3567
02:32:13,850 --> 02:32:14,370
falls in love with her.
That's the real problem.

3568
02:32:14,371 --> 02:32:15,570
No,
that's what happened.

3569
02:32:15,571 --> 02:32:17,360
He fucks it up for everyone.
He ruins the gang,

3570
02:32:17,450 --> 02:32:21,140
starts telling it Baby fucking out of.
He's like,

3571
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:25,230
I like.
I liked the courts too.

3572
02:32:25,410 --> 02:32:28,590
it's just this hot ass teacher.
Just poor kid.

3573
02:32:28,591 --> 02:32:32,440
You've terrorized him pretty right.
One of the teachers.

3574
02:32:33,150 --> 02:32:38,150
There's a whole list site dedicated to 
hot teachers that have fucked their 

3575
02:32:38,221 --> 02:32:39,010
kids.
Really?

3576
02:32:39,011 --> 02:32:40,600
Yeah.
My warlock.

3577
02:32:40,910 --> 02:32:45,910
So I had nothing.
I can't remember a single hot teacher 

3578
02:32:45,910 --> 02:32:48,150
that I had it all through my years out 
of kindergarten,

3579
02:32:48,151 --> 02:32:50,100
first grade,
ms dot yarrow smoke show.

3580
02:32:50,130 --> 02:32:54,060
There was a dude that was a handsome guy
that was a spanish teacher.

3581
02:32:54,061 --> 02:32:56,100
And I think he was like,
oh my god,

3582
02:32:56,130 --> 02:32:57,240
what?
Whoa,

3583
02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:58,340
she's hot.
It's free.

3584
02:32:58,350 --> 02:33:00,900
That woman right now,
hope I will pay her bills.

3585
02:33:01,270 --> 02:33:04,160
She doing what does it say?
Where's she going to 17?

3586
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:06,180
Can we get rid of.
He was 17,

3587
02:33:06,181 --> 02:33:09,330
between 14 and 17 for whatever.
Free on bail,

3588
02:33:09,331 --> 02:33:13,520
but was tried for oil oral.
When a new guy in print.

3589
02:33:13,550 --> 02:33:16,010
I'm brett bail.
Sugar free on bail was blowing them.

3590
02:33:16,020 --> 02:33:18,690
More people copying freak.
Look,

3591
02:33:18,710 --> 02:33:20,130
there's some girls.
Oh well.

3592
02:33:20,131 --> 02:33:22,310
A little thick.
Not too.

3593
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:27,680
I like to go get these fucking school is
dirty bitch school.

3594
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,050
They're gorgeous.
God damn it.

3595
02:33:33,700 --> 02:33:35,670
Oh yeah.
There's a lot of hotlines.

3596
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:38,530
That one's free them.
Well,

3597
02:33:39,580 --> 02:33:44,580
you know also a lot of these guys,
they're like really good at producing 

3598
02:33:44,580 --> 02:33:45,960
older women.
Young hands.

3599
02:33:45,961 --> 02:33:47,910
She's 25 year old.
Had sex with 18 year old.

3600
02:33:47,911 --> 02:33:50,490
I don't see a problem with either.
If he's 18,

3601
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:53,100
18,
18 year old male student.

3602
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:55,020
Illegal.
She's a spanish teacher.

3603
02:33:55,021 --> 02:33:57,180
Incentive.
10 sentences 18,

3604
02:33:57,181 --> 02:34:02,181
but a lot.
Preventing teachers from having sexual 

3605
02:34:02,181 --> 02:34:02,181
relationships with students regardless 
of their age.

3606
02:34:02,181 --> 02:34:06,770
Whatever.
Quit your job or guilty or guilty 

3607
02:34:07,050 --> 02:34:07,740
though.
It's all good.

3608
02:34:08,060 --> 02:34:08,740
Yeah,
for sure.

3609
02:34:08,741 --> 02:34:12,870
It's not teaching spanish and still suck
is seven years older than him.

3610
02:34:12,990 --> 02:34:17,990
He's probably given that good 18 year 
old dick just cardio for day one of a 

3611
02:34:19,781 --> 02:34:21,850
believer.
He's trying his spanish.

3612
02:34:21,890 --> 02:34:26,890
Ola.
Do you imagine you remember things that 

3613
02:34:26,890 --> 02:34:26,890
you would do when you were like a young 
teenage?

3614
02:34:26,890 --> 02:34:28,630
We couldn't even believe you were doing 
them while you were doing them.

3615
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:33,790
Is this real life like the first time I 
had an actual sexual relationship with a

3616
02:34:33,791 --> 02:34:36,220
girlfriend I remember like we would be 
having sex and be like,

3617
02:34:36,221 --> 02:34:39,820
is this what I really get to have sex?

3618
02:34:47,670 --> 02:34:50,650
When I was 16 I had ever had sex with an
older girl and I was like,

3619
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:56,100
I was like,
this is unbelievable and I would come 

3620
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:56,100
and stay hard.
Yeah,

3621
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:56,860
it's crazy.
But you get used to it.

3622
02:34:57,250 --> 02:34:58,120
You get used to.
It's like,

3623
02:34:58,121 --> 02:34:59,500
yeah,
we're going to have sex.

3624
02:34:59,501 --> 02:35:02,260
Just like anything normal comes normal.
You know?

3625
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:07,320
There's only one time in my entire life 
where my ears rang when I came and that 

3626
02:35:07,320 --> 02:35:11,491
was when I was in high school.
My girlfriend at the time blew me on a 

3627
02:35:11,491 --> 02:35:11,491
porch.
We're at a port.

3628
02:35:11,491 --> 02:35:14,860
She blew me.
I changed the shape of her head.

3629
02:35:18,180 --> 02:35:22,920
Her head became like one of those that 
they've had their fucking head clamp,

3630
02:35:22,921 --> 02:35:27,921
the one of those skull shaping jeans.
She looked like doug came and my ears 

3631
02:35:29,291 --> 02:35:33,730
were ultimate orgasm and I remember 
thinking,

3632
02:35:33,731 --> 02:35:36,260
whoa,
is this going to happen every time where

3633
02:35:36,460 --> 02:35:38,350
you're like,
are you okay to this day?

3634
02:35:38,351 --> 02:35:40,960
I'm 48 years old.
This happened probably when I was 16.

3635
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:42,310
To this day.
I think,

3636
02:35:42,311 --> 02:35:44,500
man,
if I just don't jerk off for a couple of

3637
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:45,430
weeks,
maybe I can get back.

3638
02:35:45,460 --> 02:35:47,200
You're trying to get back to the super 
soaker.

3639
02:35:48,380 --> 02:35:51,190
Don't have the willpower.
You want them to be young forever.

3640
02:35:51,191 --> 02:35:52,070
Gluten.
I,

3641
02:35:53,910 --> 02:35:55,820
I can get on that primal diet.
No,

3642
02:35:56,130 --> 02:35:56,910
no,
no.

3643
02:35:56,920 --> 02:36:00,160
I'm not going to stop shooting loads.
I guess I'm just not.

3644
02:36:00,250 --> 02:36:04,060
Now you know what the problem is?
It becomes too confusing.

3645
02:36:04,570 --> 02:36:06,730
It's like the same way I feel about 
exercise.

3646
02:36:06,850 --> 02:36:11,850
Like if someone said,
I'll give you 10 million bucks people 

3647
02:36:11,850 --> 02:36:11,850
exercise for you.

3648
02:36:11,850 --> 02:36:11,850
I couldn't do it.
I go,

3649
02:36:11,850 --> 02:36:12,040
you can fucking keep your 10 million 
bucks.

3650
02:36:12,041 --> 02:36:17,041
I'm not going to have a year of 
suffering just for some money that I'm 

3651
02:36:17,041 --> 02:36:17,041
miserable.
I can't do it.

3652
02:36:17,041 --> 02:36:18,880
And I feel the same way about jerking 
off.

3653
02:36:19,090 --> 02:36:24,090
I think that a lot of ways jerking off 
is like a type of exercise because it 

3654
02:36:24,090 --> 02:36:27,070
exercises your reproductive system so 
it's not constantly ramped up.

3655
02:36:27,690 --> 02:36:32,690
You know?
I've always felt like there's a lot of 

3656
02:36:32,690 --> 02:36:34,441
confusion that comes with being a horse.
These guys on the couch and fucking tell

3657
02:36:34,470 --> 02:36:34,680
him,
man,

3658
02:36:34,681 --> 02:36:39,470
ants exercise.
Do it by the fucking job exercise.

3659
02:36:39,580 --> 02:36:41,290
So good for you.
I told you,

3660
02:36:41,291 --> 02:36:42,490
mom,
you gotta come,

3661
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:44,650
you gotta get it out of your body.
Because if you don't,

3662
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:49,680
it pulls up and then your body starts 
getting desperate and lowers your 

3663
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:49,680
testosterone.
Not only that,

3664
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:51,370
your mind starts getting desperate and 
you start getting like,

3665
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:55,810
like I remember I went on a dry spell 
when I was just out of high school.

3666
02:36:55,810 --> 02:37:00,810
I was a fucking complete total loser 
from 17 to 18 graduating year.

3667
02:37:02,890 --> 02:37:04,750
Dude,
I was a fucking loser.

3668
02:37:04,751 --> 02:37:07,480
I didn't have not been going on.
No money couldn't get.

3669
02:37:07,810 --> 02:37:09,220
I had no money at all.
I was,

3670
02:37:09,240 --> 02:37:11,720
I was girl,
didn't give a fuck about taekwondo,

3671
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:15,500
just we'll kicking and jacket was doing.
And I was so sad.

3672
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:18,570
I couldn't get my clip,
not get lazy,

3673
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:22,430
so for ever and when I did get laid,
I finally did get laid after six months.

3674
02:37:22,431 --> 02:37:24,280
I didn't even stick it in.
I like barely got.

3675
02:37:24,930 --> 02:37:27,740
Yep.
And I just got a fucking loser.

3676
02:37:27,741 --> 02:37:28,750
I am,
but our.

3677
02:37:28,870 --> 02:37:33,870
I remember that desperate feeling,
like the desperate nature of it and then

3678
02:37:34,521 --> 02:37:39,521
I started regularly beating off.
That's when I started regularly beating 

3679
02:37:39,521 --> 02:37:42,310
off was I was just like.
I had a girlfriend when I was 16.

3680
02:37:42,320 --> 02:37:47,320
I swear to god.
I got laid before I beat off and people 

3681
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:47,320
think that's a lie.

3682
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:51,970
It is not weird though.
I didn't start beating off when I was 

3683
02:37:51,970 --> 02:37:54,170
five and I'm not kidding.
I wish I knew about nobody talked to me,

3684
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:55,850
which I figured out like,
oh,

3685
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:57,210
you get some vaseline.
You.

3686
02:37:57,500 --> 02:37:58,910
Ooh,
not me.

3687
02:37:58,911 --> 02:38:00,600
As a kid.
I used to rub it into the bed.

3688
02:38:00,770 --> 02:38:04,690
That's all I have.
Waterproof dick looks,

3689
02:38:04,790 --> 02:38:09,740
freshly waxed gleam,
fucking lots the moisture and I remember

3690
02:38:09,741 --> 02:38:13,310
being maybe fifth or sixth grade and 
just having a boner in my sweats.

3691
02:38:13,311 --> 02:38:14,420
Just be like,
oh,

3692
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:17,270
I like,
it really had no idea.

3693
02:38:17,330 --> 02:38:20,840
I was hiking and I made a day sad,
just fucking jerk me,

3694
02:38:21,010 --> 02:38:26,010
but happened to me now when I'm fucking,
I'm hiking and I'm thinking about 

3695
02:38:26,010 --> 02:38:27,260
something dirty and all of a sudden 
somebody walks by me right now I'm going

3696
02:38:27,261 --> 02:38:29,800
to be a lone guy off trail with a heart.
They say,

3697
02:38:29,810 --> 02:38:30,930
guys,
think of sex,

3698
02:38:30,931 --> 02:38:32,110
something like every three seconds.

3699
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:35,200
So girls do too.
There's a lot of free girls out there to

3700
02:38:35,210 --> 02:38:38,360
bitch.
But I'm my point being like,

3701
02:38:38,600 --> 02:38:43,600
one of the problems was I wasn't jerking
off so desperate and so that's crazy.

3702
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:48,760
I was desperate.
Uber aggressive to smelled of 

3703
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:49,460
desperation.
I'm sure girls could smell it.

3704
02:38:49,740 --> 02:38:51,470
It was a loser.
I was a loser.

3705
02:38:51,471 --> 02:38:54,530
I was living with my parents.
I didn't have a future stone wheel.

3706
02:38:55,630 --> 02:38:58,810
I'd won the state championships like one
year,

3707
02:39:00,300 --> 02:39:04,010
the first one when I was 18.
So I had no real accomplishments.

3708
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:05,760
You know,
I remember those days.

3709
02:39:05,761 --> 02:39:08,830
That was your last.
So who was the girl who was like,

3710
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:09,950
I'll suck your dick.
Joe.

3711
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:10,790
Well,
she,

3712
02:39:10,791 --> 02:39:11,780
um,
she's had sex with me.

3713
02:39:11,781 --> 02:39:13,880
I don't think she blew me.
She jerked me off a couple times for.

3714
02:39:13,881 --> 02:39:14,990
We actually had sex.
Sex.

3715
02:39:15,890 --> 02:39:19,550
Where'd you meet her?
Local local girl.

3716
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:20,600
She was just randomly.

3717
02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:21,470
Yeah,
her name was donna.

3718
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:21,810
Nice.
Because,

3719
02:39:21,890 --> 02:39:24,170
because now kids can go on instagram.
Facebook,

3720
02:39:24,171 --> 02:39:25,310
right.
So much easier.

3721
02:39:25,340 --> 02:39:28,940
It's so much easier to get chicks now.
More dangerous.

3722
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:31,430
It's way more dangerous,
but back in the day,

3723
02:39:31,431 --> 02:39:33,230
especially when you're a kid,
it was just,

3724
02:39:33,231 --> 02:39:34,670
you know,
he met the girl and it's whatever.

3725
02:39:34,671 --> 02:39:39,671
You to have a girl that hurt piece boy,
they put a red flag on her and made her 

3726
02:39:39,671 --> 02:39:40,460
walk around with a flag like people 
knew.

3727
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:45,470
People knew when people had things.
Tinder's like a weird.

3728
02:39:45,970 --> 02:39:48,310
It's fucking hot girls.
Hot girls and go.

3729
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:51,650
I liked that guy dem.
God damn son.

3730
02:39:51,870 --> 02:39:54,110
Yeah.
If you want to get laid today and you're

3731
02:39:54,111 --> 02:39:59,111
a guy,
all you have to do is have a phone and 

3732
02:39:59,111 --> 02:40:01,901
you have to be like not totally 
disgusting or have really low standards 

3733
02:40:01,901 --> 02:40:02,600
or be 49 with two kids and wife.

3734
02:40:03,230 --> 02:40:07,700
What?
A little bit of a roadblock.

3735
02:40:07,980 --> 02:40:10,040
You got to learn about russians.
Yeah.

3736
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:10,860
Yeah.
But then then,

3737
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:12,640
you know,
you go to Russia,

3738
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:16,680
I go on vacation and you come back,
or Costa Rica or to Thailand,

3739
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:19,380
maybe try and get your dick sucked.
You know when you don't want wanna,

3740
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:21,930
try not to say just good luck.
They just do it.

3741
02:40:22,150 --> 02:40:23,730
Just,
it's what they do.

3742
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:27,300
It's cultural.
You can't be rude.

3743
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:32,480
You are misappropriating,
blowjob culture from other countries or 

3744
02:40:32,480 --> 02:40:34,980
third world,
wherever they drunk indigenous people.

3745
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:38,370
Got to say all the key buzzwords.
So yeah,

3746
02:40:38,371 --> 02:40:38,880
I've,
I've,

3747
02:40:39,030 --> 02:40:41,880
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I believe one day,

3748
02:40:43,230 --> 02:40:46,620
one day,
one day we'll all be single and free.

3749
02:40:47,240 --> 02:40:49,290
Oldest fucking girls.
We shouldn't get a time,

3750
02:40:49,420 --> 02:40:50,670
dude.
That'd be three of us.

3751
02:40:50,790 --> 02:40:51,780
The checklist.
Hey,

3752
02:40:51,781 --> 02:40:53,550
that house or wrinkles girls come on.
Oh,

3753
02:40:54,410 --> 02:40:55,680
well there's gonna be some.

3754
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:59,240
There's going to be some massive 
breakthroughs within the next.

3755
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:04,280
I know.
So I know there's a massive 

3756
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:06,201
breakthrough.
The same guy who came up with regena 

3757
02:41:06,201 --> 02:41:07,881
keen is working on right now that's 
going to regenerate collagen in your 

3758
02:41:07,881 --> 02:41:10,671
body in a crazy way.
Whether it's going to eliminate 

3759
02:41:10,671 --> 02:41:10,671
wrinkles,
come on,

3760
02:41:10,671 --> 02:41:11,760
will never age.
When you're going to age,

3761
02:41:11,761 --> 02:41:16,761
you're gonna fucking die.
You're just going to look good when 

3762
02:41:16,761 --> 02:41:16,761
you're dead.
That's awesome.

3763
02:41:16,761 --> 02:41:19,700
Yeah,
but if you can keep your muscles 

3764
02:41:19,700 --> 02:41:19,700
structure and then they shoot that 
fucking shit in your body.

3765
02:41:19,700 --> 02:41:21,690
That regenerates collagen.
How long we think in.

3766
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:23,550
Well,
you don't know because there's all sorts

3767
02:41:23,551 --> 02:41:25,170
of different things they're constantly 
working on,

3768
02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:28,080
so what we're talking about is what they
have in 2016.

3769
02:41:28,081 --> 02:41:33,081
What they have in 2016 will be 
unrecognizable in 2026 because it'll be 

3770
02:41:33,081 --> 02:41:38,030
on such a higher level.
It's all exponential because every 

3771
02:41:38,030 --> 02:41:42,111
single invention in every single 
technological breakthrough and every 

3772
02:41:42,111 --> 02:41:44,610
single medical breakthrough,
they all converged together and they all

3773
02:41:44,611 --> 02:41:47,370
build on each other and new 
technological breakthroughs,

3774
02:41:47,580 --> 02:41:49,680
make new medical breakthroughs,
possible.

3775
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:54,210
New understanding of the body makes new 
new designs and new things,

3776
02:41:54,211 --> 02:41:56,400
and then then there's going to be all 
sorts of different.

3777
02:41:56,401 --> 02:42:01,401
Like they just came up with some fucking
lens that they're installing in people 

3778
02:42:01,401 --> 02:42:05,180
that is allowing people that weren't 
able to see before and now they can see 

3779
02:42:05,180 --> 02:42:07,560
new stem cell operations.
Oh my god,

3780
02:42:07,561 --> 02:42:11,340
they're doing what they're doing now is 
just the tip of the iceberg.

3781
02:42:11,341 --> 02:42:13,920
We could just stay alive if humans.
I mean as a,

3782
02:42:14,010 --> 02:42:19,010
as a,
as a race can stay alive for the next 

3783
02:42:19,010 --> 02:42:19,010
thousand years.
Well,

3784
02:42:19,010 --> 02:42:20,820
we won't be.
We'll date this machinery,

3785
02:42:21,180 --> 02:42:26,180
this,
this is this biological machinery that 

3786
02:42:26,180 --> 02:42:28,131
we let them help the next to come up 
with some shit or not guys got about 50 

3787
02:42:28,671 --> 02:42:33,671
in the next.
I really want to be on a planet where 

3788
02:42:33,671 --> 02:42:34,650
everyone can breed and no one dies.
Well,

3789
02:42:34,651 --> 02:42:35,970
not only that,
follow this.

3790
02:42:35,970 --> 02:42:37,810
What if you can download all the 
information.

3791
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:42,840
I killed people like pigs.
So what does that say about 

3792
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:45,051
accomplishment?
If you could download like how to be 

3793
02:42:45,051 --> 02:42:45,051
everything you want it to be.
If you could take approach.

3794
02:42:45,051 --> 02:42:46,830
You see that recently I haven't seen 
that.

3795
02:42:46,831 --> 02:42:47,760
No.
Oh my god.

3796
02:42:47,880 --> 02:42:48,930
To pull that up,
jamie.

3797
02:42:49,090 --> 02:42:54,090
What scientists have figured out a way.
They are very confident that they were 

3798
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:58,161
going,
they're going to be able to download 

3799
02:42:58,161 --> 02:43:00,321
skills into your brain.
Like the fucking matrix fucks us.

3800
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:04,230
They're going to be able to download 
information and skills into your special

3801
02:43:04,231 --> 02:43:04,890
anymore.
Well,

3802
02:43:04,891 --> 02:43:05,550
not,
not always.

3803
02:43:05,551 --> 02:43:10,551
No one special.
No one's going to look any different 

3804
02:43:10,551 --> 02:43:12,860
there.
Everyone's going to look like fucking 

3805
02:43:12,860 --> 02:43:12,860
john siena.
I don't want to be be around for that.

3806
02:43:12,860 --> 02:43:17,500
What is that size for risks,
but I have to believe that there's a 

3807
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:18,310
reason why they're being nudged in that 
direction.

3808
02:43:18,610 --> 02:43:21,820
Scientists discover how to upload 
knowledge to your brain.

3809
02:43:22,190 --> 02:43:25,060
This poor girl is the Guinea pig strap 
in folks,

3810
02:43:25,150 --> 02:43:30,150
strap in mean we're just.
We're just at the beginning of this 

3811
02:43:30,150 --> 02:43:30,150
thing.
This is.

3812
02:43:30,180 --> 02:43:35,180
This is not man.
Everything that's in the matrix is all 

3813
02:43:35,180 --> 02:43:35,530
going to be true.
Artificial reality,

3814
02:43:35,531 --> 02:43:37,750
whether or not it's going to take over 
the world like the matrix.

3815
02:43:37,751 --> 02:43:42,751
We're all going to be locked into some 
fucking machine and feeds off your 

3816
02:43:42,751 --> 02:43:43,690
spine.
That's probably not going to happen,

3817
02:43:43,691 --> 02:43:48,691
but what is definitely going to happen 
is virtual reality is going to be 

3818
02:43:48,691 --> 02:43:51,241
indistinguishable from regular reality.
I always leave scared when we do these 

3819
02:43:51,241 --> 02:43:51,241
podcasts.
Why don't we?

3820
02:43:51,241 --> 02:43:54,070
It's not scary,
but it's fascinating.

3821
02:43:54,790 --> 02:43:56,710
It's fascinating,
but here's the thing.

3822
02:43:57,250 --> 02:44:00,400
Here's why it shouldn't be scared 
because anybody who's ever lived,

3823
02:44:00,460 --> 02:44:03,520
ever at any time you can go back to,
you know,

3824
02:44:03,830 --> 02:44:08,830
go back to rome and grab in julius 
caesar and take him to 2016.

3825
02:44:09,190 --> 02:44:13,830
He would be like,
you gotta be fucking shit made fruit guy

3826
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:18,840
who lived the best life in the world 
hundreds of years ago or a thousand 

3827
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:23,170
years ago would be nothing in comparison
to you if you had to go back.

3828
02:44:23,171 --> 02:44:28,171
Okay.
If you had to go back and you had to 

3829
02:44:28,171 --> 02:44:29,701
live like in leonardo da vinci's town,
you'd want to fucking climb up on top of

3830
02:44:30,071 --> 02:44:32,560
a windmill and jump the fuck off.
He'd be like,

3831
02:44:32,561 --> 02:44:37,561
what?
I'm going to eat this shitty bread and 

3832
02:44:37,561 --> 02:44:37,561
we're all gonna.
We're all,

3833
02:44:37,561 --> 02:44:37,740
we're all gonna die of polio.
Already ready for that?

3834
02:44:37,741 --> 02:44:39,550
Yeah.
Get ready for the smallpox epidemic.

3835
02:44:39,551 --> 02:44:41,620
Anything.
Anything anytime or rats in town.

3836
02:44:41,621 --> 02:44:46,621
Everybody has to run flag fucking fleas.
Yeah,

3837
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:52,520
I mean you gotta figure out a way to 
know that you didn't even know that it 

3838
02:44:52,520 --> 02:44:52,520
was,
that they didn't know anything.

3839
02:44:52,520 --> 02:44:54,400
Those witches curses and shit.
They didn't know what the fuck was going

3840
02:44:54,401 --> 02:44:54,610
on.

3841
02:44:54,670 --> 02:44:56,650
Or you could go back.
Awesome.

3842
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:58,870
You could,
will you if you knew what you know now.

3843
02:44:59,090 --> 02:44:59,920
Yeah,
that's true.

3844
02:44:59,950 --> 02:45:04,950
I started drawing.
Human beings will evolve with their 

3845
02:45:04,950 --> 02:45:04,950
tasks.
So like,

3846
02:45:04,950 --> 02:45:04,950
oh shit.
You heard a shot,

3847
02:45:04,950 --> 02:45:07,180
you know what you would do?
You would go back and start,

3848
02:45:07,350 --> 02:45:09,790
you know one day have a thing called a 
microwave oven.

3849
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:11,680
And they'd say he's a which led him on 
fire.

3850
02:45:11,710 --> 02:45:12,520
Yeah.
They might kill me.

3851
02:45:12,650 --> 02:45:13,360
Yeah.
Satisfying.

3852
02:45:13,380 --> 02:45:16,610
Fought with swords too.
And you had to be a bad ass that I don't

3853
02:45:16,611 --> 02:45:19,960
know if it was a big man and favors the 
fastest guy sorta no joke.

3854
02:45:19,990 --> 02:45:23,350
So it's definitely don't favorite big 
person to favor someone is strong enough

3855
02:45:23,351 --> 02:45:26,560
to swing the sword as fast as possible.
Public await that.

3856
02:45:26,561 --> 02:45:30,070
You like any like a point of diminishing
returns to its sword fighting.

3857
02:45:30,220 --> 02:45:31,480
It's pretty final sword fighting.

3858
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:34,480
It's not so fine.
You don't walk away from a bloody no.

3859
02:45:34,510 --> 02:45:39,510
Yo.
What's interesting is musashi was a big 

3860
02:45:39,510 --> 02:45:39,510
man.
Me and my issue was not small men.

3861
02:45:39,820 --> 02:45:41,760
Thick.
Well for.

3862
02:45:41,880 --> 02:45:44,030
It's hard to tell because you know,
they.

3863
02:45:44,230 --> 02:45:49,230
What they measured,
I mean I think they probably didn't use 

3864
02:45:49,230 --> 02:45:49,230
inches.
I mean,

3865
02:45:49,230 --> 02:45:50,290
I don't know what the fuck they use 
described as being,

3866
02:45:50,340 --> 02:45:52,390
I think like thick though,
like big,

3867
02:45:52,510 --> 02:45:55,180
big sore.
You know,

3868
02:45:55,210 --> 02:45:57,160
we had a president,
I forget which president,

3869
02:45:57,161 --> 02:46:00,500
but he was five foot four and he weighed
a hundred pounds.

3870
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:02,230
Was it taft?
I think it might've been tapped.

3871
02:46:02,260 --> 02:46:02,950
No tea.
No,

3872
02:46:03,080 --> 02:46:06,910
not if it was big was a big job,
a big fat guy.

3873
02:46:06,911 --> 02:46:09,130
Because when I made saying there's no 
fat presidents,

3874
02:46:09,170 --> 02:46:10,030
people sent me pictures.

3875
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:15,960
So I was reading this book with my kid 
the other day was all about presidents 

3876
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:20,471
and weird facts about presidents,
but one of the guys was a hundred 

3877
02:46:20,471 --> 02:46:22,640
pounds,
so he's half my size.

3878
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Tiny little.
That's like a hobbit running the 

3879
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:28,000
fucking.
That's like christina.

3880
02:46:28,190 --> 02:46:29,060
Yeah.
Well,

3881
02:46:29,390 --> 02:46:33,320
well she's probably got 1:10.
He definitely smallest us president.

3882
02:46:33,710 --> 02:46:37,430
He's five for 100 pounds.
Smallest us president.

3883
02:46:37,460 --> 02:46:41,330
W was it james madison?
That's right,

3884
02:46:41,360 --> 02:46:46,360
man.
I didn't even know he was president 

3885
02:46:46,360 --> 02:46:46,360
until I was reading my daughter's book.
Madison,

3886
02:46:46,360 --> 02:46:47,600
one of the authors of the many 
presidents.

3887
02:46:47,660 --> 02:46:50,420
Can you name?
I can name maybe five,

3888
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:52,880
maybe five,
maybe five to 10.

3889
02:46:52,910 --> 02:46:54,650
Who is our third?
Who is our third president?

3890
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:56,390
Some douchebag.
Jefferson,

3891
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:57,680
okay.
How about lincoln?

3892
02:46:57,780 --> 02:47:01,010
Was he 16?
George Washington was number one.

3893
02:47:01,011 --> 02:47:02,990
Who's number two?
Nobody gives a fuck because nobody cares

3894
02:47:02,991 --> 02:47:07,991
about number two losers.
Alexander hamilton doesn't work that 

3895
02:47:07,991 --> 02:47:07,991
way.

3896
02:47:07,991 --> 02:47:09,110
It doesn't work that way.
He's gonna lose at hamilton.

3897
02:47:09,140 --> 02:47:10,370
He was a winner.
It was a new president.

3898
02:47:10,371 --> 02:47:11,090
James madison.
Wait,

3899
02:47:11,091 --> 02:47:14,480
it was the Alexander Hamilton and 
jefferson Washington.

3900
02:47:14,780 --> 02:47:19,780
Hamilton majors person.
You know who we really dismiss for one 

3901
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:20,790
term presidents.
Yeah.

3902
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:22,930
Wasn't hamilton the guy that was 
terrible.

3903
02:47:22,950 --> 02:47:25,670
He was getting all his fucking friends 
jobs and he was really,

3904
02:47:25,700 --> 02:47:27,800
really corrupt and literally wound up 
saying,

3905
02:47:27,830 --> 02:47:30,980
I'm not fit for this job.
No,

3906
02:47:31,430 --> 02:47:32,540
you're right.
It wasn't hamilton.

3907
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:34,180
It was someone else.
Find out who,

3908
02:47:34,230 --> 02:47:39,230
whose.
Whose quote was that I was not fit for 

3909
02:47:39,230 --> 02:47:39,230
this job.
So one of the presidents,

3910
02:47:39,230 --> 02:47:43,340
harding harding was considered,
I think it was.

3911
02:47:43,430 --> 02:47:46,010
It was considered the worst president 
because he was very handsome.

3912
02:47:46,270 --> 02:47:49,550
He's very good looking.
I think it was warren harding,

3913
02:47:49,710 --> 02:47:51,800
I think it was warren harding,
and he was very handsome,

3914
02:47:51,801 --> 02:47:53,240
but he was a bad president.

3915
02:47:53,240 --> 02:47:56,510
He just was not a very smart guy.
I think he looked really presidential.

3916
02:47:56,511 --> 02:47:57,950
How about,
hey,

3917
02:47:57,990 --> 02:48:02,990
I heard jfk was just a fuck and ladies.
Men three weird.

3918
02:48:03,771 --> 02:48:05,020
You really heard that?
Oh yeah.

3919
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:06,590
Hey,
hey.

3920
02:48:06,591 --> 02:48:09,500
This is breaking news along with taking 
mcgregor down.

3921
02:48:09,800 --> 02:48:14,800
Jfk gets some bitch.
You ever seen his medical records and 

3922
02:48:14,800 --> 02:48:14,800
health would a physical wreck?
He was.

3923
02:48:15,010 --> 02:48:16,020
Okay.
Yeah,

3924
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:18,830
it was Andrew Jackson.
What john was.

3925
02:48:18,831 --> 02:48:23,210
Jackson jackson was a guy who 
essentially was considered,

3926
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:24,830
first of all,
he'd seen a lot of battle.

3927
02:48:24,860 --> 02:48:26,660
He killed a lot of native americans.
No,

3928
02:48:26,661 --> 02:48:26,870
no,
no.

3929
02:48:26,871 --> 02:48:28,760
This is the wrong quote,
is the wrong quote.

3930
02:48:29,030 --> 02:48:30,140
That's not.
Andrew.

3931
02:48:30,141 --> 02:48:33,620
Jackson was talking about being a great 
general and not being.

3932
02:48:34,370 --> 02:48:39,370
Not being a great president.
He had been shot on tool and he had a 

3933
02:48:39,370 --> 02:48:41,600
hole in his in his lung that would 
perforate jfk.

3934
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:46,520
Jfk had gonorrhea and all sorts of 
horrible back problems.

3935
02:48:47,050 --> 02:48:49,430
He what was his.
It was on so many drugs.

3936
02:48:49,460 --> 02:48:51,560
Look it up.
The New York times ran a whole thing.

3937
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:55,910
I couldn't believe his medical status.
This back issue from partying or what?

3938
02:48:55,940 --> 02:49:00,940
He had a.
I think it was a congenital fuck this 

3939
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:01,940
fucking dude.
Fuck dude.

3940
02:49:01,941 --> 02:49:03,920
He will know.
He went to celebrate this.

3941
02:49:03,921 --> 02:49:07,630
He wore a brace.
He wore a body brace under his suit moto

3942
02:49:07,650 --> 02:49:09,120
and he had to be in pools.
It was.

3943
02:49:09,210 --> 02:49:11,640
He had some kind of degenerative 
disease.

3944
02:49:11,641 --> 02:49:16,641
I think back when you threw out 
gonorrhea and herpes and he was treated 

3945
02:49:16,641 --> 02:49:19,050
for gonorrhea is dot treated for them.
If you look at his medical records,

3946
02:49:19,051 --> 02:49:21,390
it's pretty unbelievable.
When they treated you for gonorrhea,

3947
02:49:21,391 --> 02:49:26,270
did they even get it back then?
I mean they just started a runny nose,

3948
02:49:26,510 --> 02:49:28,620
barely penicillin thing.
I mean,

3949
02:49:28,621 --> 02:49:32,130
what kind of fucking what kind of like 
lab tests they do back then?

3950
02:49:32,610 --> 02:49:35,940
It's pretty easy to cure with 
antibiotics.

3951
02:49:36,150 --> 02:49:38,570
Who knows what?
Yeah,

3952
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:40,200
yeah.
Well diseases are weird man,

3953
02:49:40,201 --> 02:49:45,201
because occasionally diseases come along
with it and not exactly sure what you 

3954
02:49:45,201 --> 02:49:45,630
have and they have to ask where you 
been,

3955
02:49:45,870 --> 02:49:50,870
where'd you go?
And then they have to try to sort of 

3956
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:51,270
narrow it down and test for a bunch of 
different things.

3957
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:52,710
They say,
this is an urban myth,

3958
02:49:52,711 --> 02:49:56,690
but the guy emailed this story to me 
where the curl comes,

3959
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:58,920
goes to the doctor,
she's got a rash on her face.

3960
02:49:59,060 --> 02:49:59,550
Dr.
Like,

3961
02:49:59,551 --> 02:50:04,551
what is going on here?
I couldn't figure out the sample comes 

3962
02:50:04,551 --> 02:50:04,551
up and goes,
um,

3963
02:50:04,551 --> 02:50:04,551
can I ask you a question?
Go what?

3964
02:50:04,590 --> 02:50:07,050
And he goes,
you have necrosis on your,

3965
02:50:07,470 --> 02:50:12,470
on your face.
You have a bacteria that you get from 

3966
02:50:12,470 --> 02:50:12,470
dead bodies.
We've been around dead bodies because.

3967
02:50:12,470 --> 02:50:13,230
No.
And he said,

3968
02:50:13,231 --> 02:50:14,040
where'd you go?

3969
02:50:14,070 --> 02:50:15,240
She goes,
I was in Ireland.

3970
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:17,610
What did you hook up with?
Anybody who said,

3971
02:50:17,611 --> 02:50:18,690
yeah,
guy in a bar.

3972
02:50:18,790 --> 02:50:19,830
He goes,
do you have his number?

3973
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:20,540
Yeah,
yeah,

3974
02:50:20,550 --> 02:50:20,850
blah,
blah,

3975
02:50:20,851 --> 02:50:25,851
blah.
It turns out the guy worked in a morgue 

3976
02:50:25,851 --> 02:50:28,370
and he was fucking bodies.
She sucked as zombie dick.

3977
02:50:28,470 --> 02:50:29,180
Okay,
but is this.

3978
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:34,280
And she sucked his dick and got.
And that's it that I was told that's an 

3979
02:50:34,280 --> 02:50:37,760
urban myth,
but this is what the guy emailed me and 

3980
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:37,760
told me the story of jesus christ.
Because story,

3981
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:39,660
if it's a well,
why don't let's go further.

3982
02:50:39,661 --> 02:50:44,661
Then she started time traveling and went
back to the time before she did it and 

3983
02:50:44,661 --> 02:50:46,200
then it became two of her and the two of
her plotted to take over the world.

3984
02:50:46,330 --> 02:50:47,830
He just making shit up at this point 
possible.

3985
02:50:47,860 --> 02:50:52,860
You know,
we don't know if a story that's such a 

3986
02:50:52,860 --> 02:50:53,460
good store,
but it's kind of google these things get

3987
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:54,660
on your damn phone.

3988
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:59,680
It makes sense.
Or they hold it far away from you so we 

3989
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:01,710
could use our.
My eyes are so bad now.

3990
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:04,410
They're so good at this distance.
They're perfect,

3991
02:51:04,411 --> 02:51:07,350
but then you're right here.
I can always like.

3992
02:51:07,570 --> 02:51:08,190
Yeah,
lucky.

3993
02:51:08,191 --> 02:51:10,920
I don't have to read my own fingerprints
on here.

3994
02:51:11,110 --> 02:51:15,360
It was just a pink blush.
Stories kind of legit though.

3995
02:51:15,390 --> 02:51:17,220
Makes sense.
I'm sorta,

3996
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:19,140
sorta makes sense.
I could see it happening.

3997
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:24,600
It makes sense that dead bodies would 
have bacteria on them that would be 

3998
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:27,590
eating the dead body and if you had any 
sort of an infection or cut on the south

3999
02:51:27,770 --> 02:51:30,930
or you didn't wash and it got into your 
system.

4000
02:51:31,020 --> 02:51:32,130
Sure.
That makes sense.

4001
02:51:32,140 --> 02:51:33,960
Very cox dead body.
Oh,

4002
02:51:33,970 --> 02:51:35,760
a lot of people.
Yeah.

4003
02:51:35,761 --> 02:51:40,300
That's been a real problem many times in
funeral homes.

4004
02:51:40,700 --> 02:51:43,440
I told you my acting teacher right when 
he came out,

4005
02:51:43,441 --> 02:51:45,000
his mother died.
He told his story.

4006
02:51:45,420 --> 02:51:50,420
His mother dies.
Fucking goes to see her body in the 

4007
02:51:50,420 --> 02:51:53,571
morgue and the guys coming out and 
putting his pants on sweating and he 

4008
02:51:53,571 --> 02:51:53,580
looked at the guy and the guy looked at 
him and he goes,

4009
02:51:54,360 --> 02:51:55,710
you fuck my mother.
He didn't say it,

4010
02:51:55,711 --> 02:51:57,180
but he knew it.
He never said anything.

4011
02:51:57,181 --> 02:51:58,740
The guy just ran out,
beat the fuck out.

4012
02:51:58,741 --> 02:52:00,350
Like I just went,
fuck that.

4013
02:52:00,390 --> 02:52:02,620
Why didn't he go check his mom's box?
He did.

4014
02:52:03,690 --> 02:52:04,620
He did.
Well,

4015
02:52:04,621 --> 02:52:05,770
I don't know if you checked our box,

4016
02:52:06,060 --> 02:52:10,410
check the box to take that asset.
Pulled out my kit kit.

4017
02:52:10,430 --> 02:52:12,810
I'd have to kill someone.
That's another way.

4018
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:17,820
I don't think you do.
I don't think you'd do jail time for 

4019
02:52:17,820 --> 02:52:17,820
that.
You would get a fine for it.

4020
02:52:17,820 --> 02:52:17,820
Oh no.
Jail side.

4021
02:52:17,820 --> 02:52:17,820
No,
no,

4022
02:52:17,820 --> 02:52:18,160
no,
no,

4023
02:52:18,280 --> 02:52:19,250
no.
You.

4024
02:52:19,870 --> 02:52:21,450
You're going to jail.
It's a.

4025
02:52:21,550 --> 02:52:26,550
It's a.
There's a law about mishandling a dead 

4026
02:52:26,550 --> 02:52:26,680
body,
but it's really.

4027
02:52:27,630 --> 02:52:28,680
There you go.
So the legend,

4028
02:52:28,790 --> 02:52:29,410
the legend.
Yeah.

4029
02:52:30,030 --> 02:52:32,900
Been told over and over again.
There you go.

4030
02:52:34,270 --> 02:52:36,460
Scroll down and see if there's any 
possibility.

4031
02:52:37,690 --> 02:52:39,040
See,
scroll down.

4032
02:52:39,070 --> 02:52:39,400
Blah,
blah,

4033
02:52:39,401 --> 02:52:39,730
blah.
Oh,

4034
02:52:39,731 --> 02:52:44,731
these are the same emails over and over 
and the girl got herpes from whatever 

4035
02:52:44,731 --> 02:52:46,420
reason.
Started fucking making stuff up.

4036
02:52:46,450 --> 02:52:49,060
There's certain things that are like 
supposed to be urban mess,

4037
02:52:49,061 --> 02:52:52,240
but you find out their true charles 
manson endorsing trump is not.

4038
02:52:52,300 --> 02:52:54,420
Is not following a.

4039
02:52:54,430 --> 02:52:55,990
Who cares?
The charles manson endorses.

4040
02:52:56,140 --> 02:53:01,140
You know what's weird?
The trump guys who are putting fucking 

4041
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:03,140
ss style bands around their arms.
Have you seen a show?

4042
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:06,490
These idiots are taken bumper stickers,
trump bumper stickers,

4043
02:53:06,491 --> 02:53:08,380
and they're wrapping them around their 
arms like hitler.

4044
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:12,430
Armbands bad look.
White people just get so wacky.

4045
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:16,120
Fucking white people.
White people are a lot like the economy,

4046
02:53:16,121 --> 02:53:21,121
the economy,
cyclical white people on an upswing 

4047
02:53:21,121 --> 02:53:21,121
right now.
They're on the upswing.

4048
02:53:21,121 --> 02:53:21,790
Ups.
Everything was all good.

4049
02:53:21,880 --> 02:53:23,200
Yeah.
Look at these guys.

4050
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:29,160
Dip shits not good.
These guys have fucking bumper stickers 

4051
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:32,550
around their arm like trump is the new 
hitler and it's kinda macho is.

4052
02:53:32,970 --> 02:53:33,790
No.
Oh my god.

4053
02:53:33,791 --> 02:53:34,810
It's not a bumper sticker.

4054
02:53:37,010 --> 02:53:42,010
Some real is mostly false facts.
She found this on snopes without even 

4055
02:53:42,010 --> 02:53:43,910
knowing.
It was just two guys,

4056
02:53:44,360 --> 02:53:46,490
two young women were photographed 
wearing nazi style.

4057
02:53:46,500 --> 02:53:46,980
All right.
Okay.

4058
02:53:47,150 --> 02:53:49,640
You know what?
They probably wanted us to talk to them.

4059
02:53:50,150 --> 02:53:51,260
Okay.
What's false?

4060
02:53:51,290 --> 02:53:52,130
Hold on.
Scroll down.

4061
02:53:52,370 --> 02:53:57,370
The two men were legitimate trump 
supporters and the use of nazi armbands 

4062
02:53:57,370 --> 02:53:58,530
express their genuine political beliefs.
So they really did it well.

4063
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:00,680
What were they doing when they show me 
around?

4064
02:54:00,800 --> 02:54:01,930
It doesn't mean they're nazis.
Well,

4065
02:54:01,931 --> 02:54:06,931
were they doing just fox news?
A tweet that supported the republican 

4066
02:54:06,931 --> 02:54:08,240
presidential Donald Trump spot in 
Florida rally,

4067
02:54:08,241 --> 02:54:08,660
but blah,
blah,

4068
02:54:08,661 --> 02:54:09,170
blah,
blah.

4069
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:11,540
Not dissimilar.
Okay,

4070
02:54:11,541 --> 02:54:12,410
but what is it?
What?

4071
02:54:12,470 --> 02:54:14,510
What's,
what's really going on and scroll down.

4072
02:54:15,220 --> 02:54:20,220
So what are they saying?
The art band was one of many invoked of 

4073
02:54:20,220 --> 02:54:20,220
nazi imagery.
We,

4074
02:54:20,220 --> 02:54:20,450
we,
we,

4075
02:54:20,490 --> 02:54:20,940
we,
we,

4076
02:54:20,941 --> 02:54:23,150
we photoshop.
But what is it saying?

4077
02:54:23,780 --> 02:54:25,310
What does it say?
How is it not true?

4078
02:54:26,300 --> 02:54:31,300
However,
it appeared that the initial tweet was 

4079
02:54:31,300 --> 02:54:33,311
sent with that much verification as to 
whether trump armbands were legitimate 

4080
02:54:33,311 --> 02:54:34,990
campaign memorabilia.
Sported you,

4081
02:54:35,390 --> 02:54:36,500
you,
you know,

4082
02:54:36,510 --> 02:54:37,930
chronically on.
Ironically,

4083
02:54:39,710 --> 02:54:44,710
ironically,
by dutiful supporters of the gop 

4084
02:54:44,710 --> 02:54:45,350
presidential hopeful not long after the 
image hit twitter,

4085
02:54:45,740 --> 02:54:50,740
hard users began pointing out that the 
trump supporters looked awfully 

4086
02:54:50,740 --> 02:54:51,770
familiar.
So who are they?

4087
02:54:52,280 --> 02:54:54,170
Other jokes.
They're comedians.

4088
02:54:55,600 --> 02:54:56,570
Oh,
they're comics.

4089
02:54:56,720 --> 02:54:58,380
They keep showing up.
Political prankster.

4090
02:54:59,260 --> 02:55:00,670
Fuck it.
They wouldn't go.

4091
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:01,970
They go.
When they got us,

4092
02:55:02,210 --> 02:55:04,210
they got us.
Well now we know play.

4093
02:55:04,680 --> 02:55:07,270
People were sending that late today and 
I was like,

4094
02:55:07,370 --> 02:55:12,370
what do you see when you see when they 
grew a fucking dinosaur leg on a 

4095
02:55:12,370 --> 02:55:15,941
chicken,
a real dinosaur like no park is gonna 

4096
02:55:17,970 --> 02:55:21,050
fucking come and I will be the first 
one.

4097
02:55:21,060 --> 02:55:26,060
There will be the first one there to see
all sympathetic american consumer.

4098
02:55:26,810 --> 02:55:30,400
You'll be there with fresh,
a new hair.

4099
02:55:30,401 --> 02:55:35,401
Do synthetic dna.
You're going to have create your own 

4100
02:55:35,401 --> 02:55:38,591
animal from your own imagination.
Scientists have grown dinosaur legs on 

4101
02:55:38,591 --> 02:55:40,910
chicken for the first time.
What in the fuck?

4102
02:55:41,810 --> 02:55:44,000
What the fuck?
How about you guys?

4103
02:55:44,001 --> 02:55:45,500
Cure cancer?
Yeah.

4104
02:55:45,501 --> 02:55:47,630
How about you figuring out a way to get 
salt at the ocean?

4105
02:55:47,631 --> 02:55:50,090
You assholes.
Stop making dinosaurs.

4106
02:55:50,120 --> 02:55:55,120
It's all part of it.
Help you help the ozone funds with a 

4107
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:55,400
dinosaur.
It's all part of it is all part of it,

4108
02:55:55,401 --> 02:56:00,401
right?
We shouldn't expect these guys to make 

4109
02:56:00,401 --> 02:56:02,471
better cell phones.
They have a different field of study 

4110
02:56:02,471 --> 02:56:05,201
about that life.
The chickens out about that,

4111
02:56:05,990 --> 02:56:10,990
bro.
I ain't about that book about the 

4112
02:56:10,990 --> 02:56:10,990
chicken eggs on some pitch.

4113
02:56:14,410 --> 02:56:16,700
It's so rare that someone's job.
Dude,

4114
02:56:16,701 --> 02:56:18,500
I'll tell you,
when you watched chickens eat,

4115
02:56:18,501 --> 02:56:23,501
you realize they're just dinosaurs.
They're just little bit little 

4116
02:56:23,501 --> 02:56:23,501
dinosaurs.
They can't kill you,

4117
02:56:23,501 --> 02:56:24,530
so they just deal with it when they can 
make dick cells.

4118
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:26,750
How many,
how big do you think guys are?

4119
02:56:26,890 --> 02:56:31,890
How much bigger there?
No one is going to have a little dick 

4120
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:31,890
anymore,
that's for sure.

4121
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:34,840
That's for sure.
No one's just going to say you going to 

4122
02:56:34,840 --> 02:56:37,940
get.
How big is your dick going to get and 

4123
02:56:37,940 --> 02:56:37,940
how many guys,
guys,

4124
02:56:37,940 --> 02:56:37,940
guys,
guys,

4125
02:56:37,940 --> 02:56:41,400
guys get weird without having surgeries 
like just inject my dig and if you can 

4126
02:56:41,400 --> 02:56:43,610
jean dope or whatever it is.
For crispr crispr,

4127
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:48,200
crispr is bad ass going to be at least a
foot long and girls pussies are going to

4128
02:56:48,201 --> 02:56:49,460
grow.
I had a whole bit about this,

4129
02:56:50,050 --> 02:56:53,030
but the bet if they did come up with big
dick pills,

4130
02:56:53,031 --> 02:56:55,690
like those commercials that ron jeremy 
used to sell three in the morning,

4131
02:56:55,691 --> 02:57:00,691
if it was real pills,
those pills really did make your dick 

4132
02:57:00,691 --> 02:57:00,691
bigger.

4133
02:57:00,691 --> 02:57:02,810
It would be about 30 seconds before the 
first guy died of an overdose.

4134
02:57:03,150 --> 02:57:06,060
I might because no one's taken one pill 
over there.

4135
02:57:06,260 --> 02:57:09,800
How many gives me a stroke?
The problem is dick should be so big.

4136
02:57:09,801 --> 02:57:14,801
The vagina's would grow too because 
people would still have to breed and 

4137
02:57:14,801 --> 02:57:16,130
they would evolve and have to adapt.
I said they would turn into giant flying

4138
02:57:16,131 --> 02:57:21,131
squirrel pussy people.
They're just people that are jews with 

4139
02:57:21,131 --> 02:57:23,981
big dicks that haven't been shopping.
Cart's going to be chasing these girls 

4140
02:57:23,981 --> 02:57:26,621
to the top of cliffs and the women would
just leap to safety like squirrel 

4141
02:57:28,370 --> 02:57:33,370
squirrel.
Like imagine what kind of weird shapes 

4142
02:57:33,370 --> 02:57:37,661
people are gonna come into like now.
What we're dealing with now is people 

4143
02:57:37,661 --> 02:57:40,280
that are starting to explore the 
possibility of modifying their body with

4144
02:57:40,281 --> 02:57:44,330
tattoos and piercings or weird shit.
But once you can change the shape,

4145
02:57:44,790 --> 02:57:49,790
yeah.
You know you're going to lose the 

4146
02:57:49,790 --> 02:57:49,790
funnier loose.
You know the people.

4147
02:57:49,790 --> 02:57:51,480
That's not good.
We'll have variety though.

4148
02:57:51,500 --> 02:57:53,480
Just because everybody has a different 
idea of what's beautiful.

4149
02:57:53,481 --> 02:57:55,010
Everybody has a different idea of what 
they want.

4150
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:57,770
Someone's going to want to be.
The whole is going to be like,

4151
02:57:57,800 --> 02:57:59,870
no,
I to know I want to be five foot one.

4152
02:57:59,871 --> 02:58:01,320
Man.
I like to keep this.

4153
02:58:01,380 --> 02:58:02,070
I want to keep these

4154
02:58:02,230 --> 02:58:04,320
pits and small day.
Madison,

4155
02:58:04,350 --> 02:58:06,750
you'll have less people who are longing 
for something.

4156
02:58:06,751 --> 02:58:11,751
Right?
You'll have if you have an ability and 

4157
02:58:11,751 --> 02:58:11,751
the money,
if it's fake,

4158
02:58:11,751 --> 02:58:12,660
but they'll still be people left out 
because it's going to cost money.

4159
02:58:12,661 --> 02:58:14,040
You're going to ask you.
You feel me?

4160
02:58:14,041 --> 02:58:19,041
Like reading,
you know like it used to be a long time 

4161
02:58:19,041 --> 02:58:19,410
ago that reading was a luxury that very 
few people could read,

4162
02:58:19,650 --> 02:58:21,600
but now have couldn't afford books.
Right now.

4163
02:58:21,601 --> 02:58:23,910
Pretty much everybody could read.
Anybody could get books,

4164
02:58:23,940 --> 02:58:28,940
and not only that,
you can get so much off the internet 

4165
02:58:28,940 --> 02:58:30,771
that's free.
You can get your access to information 

4166
02:58:30,771 --> 02:58:30,771
today is better than it's ever been 
before.

4167
02:58:30,771 --> 02:58:35,151
Fuck,
your access to changing your body will 

4168
02:58:35,151 --> 02:58:35,970
follow a similar,
doesn't mean happier and it doesn't mean

4169
02:58:35,971 --> 02:58:37,800
that will be more fulfilled,
I would imagine.

4170
02:58:37,801 --> 02:58:42,801
I think the responsibility to creating 
your own fulfillment will still remain 

4171
02:58:42,801 --> 02:58:44,700
and they can make artificial happiness.

4172
02:58:44,730 --> 02:58:47,370
Got damage.
Problem is we like went on drugs,

4173
02:58:47,371 --> 02:58:48,210
right?
Yeah.

4174
02:58:48,240 --> 02:58:51,030
Well the problem is what is happened is 
really based on just.

4175
02:58:51,630 --> 02:58:53,790
You know what I'm talking about ecstasy 
all day.

4176
02:58:54,060 --> 02:58:59,060
If you were just rolling all day,
but no negative repercussions can't get 

4177
02:58:59,060 --> 02:59:00,470
shit done,
art wouldn't be created.

4178
02:59:00,480 --> 02:59:01,340
Right?
Art,

4179
02:59:01,380 --> 02:59:04,660
when you get your dick sucked while 
you're on ecstasy on her son.

4180
02:59:04,920 --> 02:59:09,890
How about you fly like an eagle?
You guys are fucking god.

4181
02:59:10,120 --> 02:59:11,520
Oh my god.
It's crisper.

4182
02:59:11,730 --> 02:59:16,730
Yeah,
that's the new god because we're 

4183
02:59:16,730 --> 02:59:16,730
controlling our own evolution.
I wonder,

4184
02:59:16,730 --> 02:59:16,730
man,
I wonder what it's gonna look like.

4185
02:59:16,730 --> 02:59:18,090
I mean,
it's going to change.

4186
02:59:18,150 --> 02:59:19,500
It's not going to just.
No one's ever going to go,

4187
02:59:19,501 --> 02:59:21,870
hey everybody,
let's go camping.

4188
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:23,620
Let's stop all this.
Right?

4189
02:59:23,910 --> 02:59:27,240
We're not going to do that.
Those dudes that had grown dinosaur legs

4190
02:59:27,241 --> 02:59:29,940
and chickens,
that's the satisfaction.

4191
02:59:30,320 --> 02:59:34,330
Satisfaction,
you get from overcoming the impossible,

4192
02:59:34,480 --> 02:59:36,480
almost as good as learning kung fu in 
the matrix,

4193
02:59:36,690 --> 02:59:39,210
but if,
but if someone can take the shortcut,

4194
02:59:39,390 --> 02:59:42,180
don't you think the math is that they 
can take the shortcut,

4195
02:59:42,570 --> 02:59:43,770
then I can put the work in.

4196
02:59:43,830 --> 02:59:48,830
I don't know.
What I'm saying is that there may be 

4197
02:59:48,830 --> 02:59:52,101
shortcuts in certain in certain areas,
but we'll still have challenges and you 

4198
02:59:52,101 --> 02:59:52,380
know,
hope you're right,

4199
02:59:52,381 --> 02:59:52,600
brian.
Yeah.

4200
02:59:52,690 --> 02:59:54,240
So,
so if you're really good at something,

4201
02:59:54,241 --> 02:59:55,890
if you're really good at whatever you 
want to be,

4202
02:59:56,310 --> 02:59:58,420
I wonder if you know,
you know,

4203
02:59:58,421 --> 03:00:00,300
like for example,
like what I like about tennis,

4204
03:00:00,330 --> 03:00:02,700
what you like about archery,
what you like about boxing,

4205
03:00:02,701 --> 03:00:07,701
whatever it is,
is it the repetition and the state of 

4206
03:00:07,701 --> 03:00:10,311
puts you in and the slow attrition of,
of a skillset is immensely satisfying.

4207
03:00:11,761 --> 03:00:16,761
Right?
I wonder if you could just do it right 

4208
03:00:16,761 --> 03:00:16,761
away.
I wonder if all the fun goes away.

4209
03:00:16,761 --> 03:00:18,490
It doesn't snow more mystery,
but mr.

4210
03:00:18,760 --> 03:00:21,780
Learning because when you're hitting a 
ball really well or you're boxing really

4211
03:00:21,781 --> 03:00:24,400
well one day and you know,
you go back.

4212
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:25,950
Yeah.
And you go today,

4213
03:00:25,951 --> 03:00:30,951
I hit it,
and if you don't have something to 

4214
03:00:30,951 --> 03:00:32,790
compare that to,
I think what happens is you end up being

4215
03:00:32,910 --> 03:00:37,910
generally copacetic and and I wonder 
what it says about downloads.

4216
03:00:37,990 --> 03:00:42,990
Skateboarding,
just a fake ass dude skateboarding like 

4217
03:00:42,990 --> 03:00:46,070
I think who you are right now is based 
on what our ideas are right now about 

4218
03:00:46,070 --> 03:00:48,420
what people want and what people need 
and what makes us happy.

4219
03:00:48,630 --> 03:00:51,150
And one of the things that makes us 
happy is overcoming adversity.

4220
03:00:51,151 --> 03:00:56,151
Trying to figure out puzzles,
trying to set goals and accomplishing 

4221
03:00:56,151 --> 03:00:58,841
them.
Setting goals and accomplishing them is 

4222
03:00:58,841 --> 03:00:58,980
one of the biggest sources of happiness.
One of the things that people say,

4223
03:00:59,110 --> 03:01:00,370
if you really want to be happy,

4224
03:01:00,370 --> 03:01:03,910
you should have projects and she'd set 
goals and she'd try to accomplish those.

4225
03:01:03,911 --> 03:01:08,911
And for whatever reason it's probably 
just some deep seated evolutionary 

4226
03:01:08,911 --> 03:01:09,580
reason and it's something that's in our 
dna.

4227
03:01:09,610 --> 03:01:13,360
We have this desire to achieve things 
and when we do achieve them,

4228
03:01:13,570 --> 03:01:16,090
it gives us this feeling of happiness.
And if you don't do that,

4229
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:20,560
like the most regretful,
sorrowful depressed people,

4230
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:24,790
rarely set goals and rarely achieve 
those set goals for whatever reason.

4231
03:01:24,820 --> 03:01:27,790
Now whether or not the creek and they 
hate on others who are trying to achieve

4232
03:01:27,791 --> 03:01:32,791
that.
So what is what we're doing kind of is 

4233
03:01:32,791 --> 03:01:35,110
like some sort of a weird balancing act 
with our ancient primate minds,

4234
03:01:35,170 --> 03:01:40,170
right?
So our ancient primate mines which 

4235
03:01:40,170 --> 03:01:40,170
wanted to survive,
they wanted to gather food,

4236
03:01:40,170 --> 03:01:42,490
they wanted to figure out things like 
how do I catch this fish?

4237
03:01:42,491 --> 03:01:44,620
How do I,
how do I start a fire?

4238
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:48,850
And all these different desires that we 
had to both breed,

4239
03:01:48,851 --> 03:01:51,010
protect our territory,
overcome,

4240
03:01:51,011 --> 03:01:56,011
and they manifest themselves as like 
rewards and these human rewards are in 

4241
03:01:56,171 --> 03:01:57,610
our system.
And we,

4242
03:01:57,730 --> 03:02:02,730
we intrinsically linked those rewards 
and in this system to life.

4243
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:08,040
And this is the only way to live and 
this is the way we live because we've 

4244
03:02:08,040 --> 03:02:10,831
always lived like this.
But if we can completely remove 

4245
03:02:10,831 --> 03:02:15,001
ourselves from the biological process,
completely remove ourselves from the 

4246
03:02:15,020 --> 03:02:19,060
lust and the greed and the what,
what do we become?

4247
03:02:19,150 --> 03:02:21,160
And is that actually a better way to 
live?

4248
03:02:21,660 --> 03:02:22,980
Maybe it's a good question,
but.

4249
03:02:22,990 --> 03:02:24,750
But I,
but I think that you have to add,

4250
03:02:24,820 --> 03:02:27,070
you have to add another dimension to 
what you said,

4251
03:02:27,100 --> 03:02:28,610
which is yes,
there,

4252
03:02:28,620 --> 03:02:33,620
there is that evolutionary notion of 
reward that creates a feeling of,

4253
03:02:33,671 --> 03:02:35,920
for example,
safety and whatever it might be.

4254
03:02:36,090 --> 03:02:41,090
Right?
But I wonder also if the other reason 

4255
03:02:41,090 --> 03:02:44,731
that we seem to have this need to get 
better at something like just say the 

4256
03:02:44,731 --> 03:02:46,510
violin or whatever it might be.
I,

4257
03:02:46,511 --> 03:02:51,511
I think that there's another thing that 
happens to you when you get really good 

4258
03:02:51,511 --> 03:02:52,510
at something.
When you develop this a deep skill,

4259
03:02:52,720 --> 03:02:56,170
I think you get a better understanding 
of you.

4260
03:02:56,260 --> 03:03:01,260
Like you go,
you come closer to who you truly are in 

4261
03:03:01,260 --> 03:03:04,771
your essence.
The notion that when you do something 

4262
03:03:04,771 --> 03:03:07,150
for the sake of its own doing,
which would be considered play,

4263
03:03:07,490 --> 03:03:09,280
that that's how you would define 
probably play.

4264
03:03:10,090 --> 03:03:13,390
That's when you are the most authentic 
and truly yourself.

4265
03:03:14,120 --> 03:03:19,120
And I feel like human beings not only 
having nostalgia like a built in 

4266
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:21,160
nostalgia to try to find who they were 
originally.

4267
03:03:21,730 --> 03:03:26,530
But I think also it's just my general 
idea that I wonder if,

4268
03:03:26,590 --> 03:03:31,590
because the internet is bringing us all 
together and we're getting a deeper 

4269
03:03:31,590 --> 03:03:32,680
understanding of what it is to be each 
other in one way or another,

4270
03:03:32,770 --> 03:03:37,770
and we're going to end pretty soon if 
you can download not only information 

4271
03:03:37,770 --> 03:03:39,100
but what it's like to be joe rogan into 
my brain.

4272
03:03:39,850 --> 03:03:42,700
Well,
if that's bringing us all together then,

4273
03:03:42,770 --> 03:03:47,170
then I wonder if the.
The end goal is something in the area of

4274
03:03:47,650 --> 03:03:52,650
deep self knowledge and deep knowledge,
deep human knowledge sort of this 

4275
03:03:52,720 --> 03:03:55,330
creating this,
this neural net.

4276
03:03:55,331 --> 03:03:57,260
So we're all.
Sorry for the,

4277
03:03:57,290 --> 03:04:02,290
for the word one.
You know that that seems to be the two 

4278
03:04:02,290 --> 03:04:06,400
thing that that spiritual dimension,
that thing that's hard to measure has 

4279
03:04:06,400 --> 03:04:06,980
always existed in human beings.

4280
03:04:07,170 --> 03:04:09,500
We,
we somehow always want.

4281
03:04:09,620 --> 03:04:11,090
And I think it's where religion comes 
from,

4282
03:04:11,091 --> 03:04:16,091
where inspiration comes from.
We seem to always want to reach beyond 

4283
03:04:17,031 --> 03:04:18,350
ourselves.
What is that?

4284
03:04:18,351 --> 03:04:21,560
It's always going to be there no matter 
what I was going to be there.

4285
03:04:21,561 --> 03:04:26,561
I think it's going to be there for 
operating inside of the biological 

4286
03:04:26,561 --> 03:04:26,561
parameters that we currently have to 
operate on.

4287
03:04:26,561 --> 03:04:27,390
You say,
if we can get out of this,

4288
03:04:27,640 --> 03:04:29,510
think history will be taken away.
If what?

4289
03:04:29,511 --> 03:04:31,190
If?
What if they can eliminate greed,

4290
03:04:31,320 --> 03:04:36,320
would agree the the,
the instinct of greed can be located in 

4291
03:04:36,320 --> 03:04:37,670
our genome and can be eliminated.
Well,

4292
03:04:37,671 --> 03:04:38,790
greed,
greed,

4293
03:04:39,580 --> 03:04:41,300
exactly.
Mighty might be valuable.

4294
03:04:41,570 --> 03:04:43,100
Great.
Jealousy,

4295
03:04:43,101 --> 03:04:45,290
might be valuable to greet also may be 
great.

4296
03:04:45,291 --> 03:04:50,291
Also be that that primordial need to 
amass as much food and as much what?

4297
03:04:50,480 --> 03:04:55,360
Safety and as much power so that you 
stay alive.

4298
03:04:55,390 --> 03:05:00,390
That's the one thing we know is that 
human beings across the board what love 

4299
03:05:00,390 --> 03:05:01,090
one thing above all and that is 
immortality.

4300
03:05:01,290 --> 03:05:04,970
Well,
what I'm thinking is a lot of our ideas,

4301
03:05:05,030 --> 03:05:10,030
a lot of our ideas of what was valuable 
and what we want and what we need and 

4302
03:05:10,030 --> 03:05:14,741
what is just part of life.
A lot of those ideas are only based on 

4303
03:05:14,741 --> 03:05:15,510
the current model of human.
Exactly.

4304
03:05:15,550 --> 03:05:20,550
That exists when they start manipulating
shit and downloading new thoughts in 

4305
03:05:20,550 --> 03:05:24,591
your mind and do you want to go like 
fucking meditate in a in an ashram for 

4306
03:05:24,891 --> 03:05:28,640
10 years and sweep up and just home all 
day in the corner,

4307
03:05:28,730 --> 03:05:32,660
or how about they just press a button 
and shoot some shit straightened to your

4308
03:05:32,661 --> 03:05:35,300
brain and you could read minds.
You're going to take that.

4309
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:37,790
You're going to take like instant 
enlightenment.

4310
03:05:37,940 --> 03:05:42,940
You're going to take the ability to 
transcend all of our biological 

4311
03:05:42,940 --> 03:05:46,991
impulses,
including the dumb ones like self doubt 

4312
03:05:46,991 --> 03:05:48,660
and fear and hate and jealousy like 
this.

4313
03:05:49,970 --> 03:05:51,290
Exactly,
exactly.

4314
03:05:51,291 --> 03:05:52,460
Yeah.
That's the real thing.

4315
03:05:52,461 --> 03:05:57,461
Even if you can even like ray kurzweil 
who created this sort of movement of 

4316
03:05:57,461 --> 03:05:58,250
curve,
chris wireless,

4317
03:05:58,251 --> 03:05:59,730
the notion that,
all right,

4318
03:05:59,810 --> 03:06:03,170
we all say we're going to die.
We all know human beings have one goal.

4319
03:06:03,171 --> 03:06:06,230
It's to stay alive forever.
It's why we do great work and we want it

4320
03:06:06,231 --> 03:06:07,490
to live on.
We have children.

4321
03:06:07,491 --> 03:06:09,170
That's why we were so attached to our 
children,

4322
03:06:09,620 --> 03:06:12,680
if not necessarily true,
because we do because we enjoy it.

4323
03:06:12,681 --> 03:06:17,681
While we're doing that to 100 percent of
you have kids thinking going to live on,

4324
03:06:17,751 --> 03:06:20,270
I don't think you make.
You don't make a painting.

4325
03:06:20,271 --> 03:06:21,680
No.
This will go on forever.

4326
03:06:21,681 --> 03:06:23,900
You have this idea in your head and you 
wanna express yourself.

4327
03:06:24,340 --> 03:06:25,100
Yeah,
I,

4328
03:06:25,120 --> 03:06:27,740
I agree with you on that,
but I just think that overall,

4329
03:06:27,741 --> 03:06:32,741
if you looked at the general overall 
over arching sort of desire,

4330
03:06:32,751 --> 03:06:37,751
a need in a human being,
it's probably we all want to live 

4331
03:06:37,751 --> 03:06:37,751
forever.
We don't want to die.

4332
03:06:37,751 --> 03:06:39,250
I think it's just a fear of death,
desire,

4333
03:06:41,110 --> 03:06:42,110
follow this.
Uh,

4334
03:06:42,240 --> 03:06:45,620
so if,
if we can download our essence,

4335
03:06:45,710 --> 03:06:47,230
if I could download everything that's in
your brain,

4336
03:06:47,240 --> 03:06:52,240
your memories and your paradigm,
your paradigm or whatever the words are 

4337
03:06:52,240 --> 03:06:56,280
a.
And then I could put that into a 

4338
03:06:56,280 --> 03:06:56,280
computer,
a or a robot.

4339
03:06:56,280 --> 03:06:58,020
Then you kind of keep living forever in 
a way.

4340
03:06:58,021 --> 03:07:03,021
Right?
So what does that say about when you 

4341
03:07:03,021 --> 03:07:03,021
change,
like whatever you are,

4342
03:07:03,021 --> 03:07:04,320
if they download you and put you in a 
computer,

4343
03:07:04,350 --> 03:07:09,350
they're going to have all your flaws,
or is it going to be filled with all 

4344
03:07:09,350 --> 03:07:11,640
your insecurities going to be?
Is it going to be a liar,

4345
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:16,680
imagined the computer becomes a liar.
Imagine if the computer or develops its 

4346
03:07:16,680 --> 03:07:19,881
own insecurities and starts coming.
It changes who you are and starts going 

4347
03:07:19,881 --> 03:07:21,150
down its own weird emotional paths.
Those are programmed in.

4348
03:07:21,360 --> 03:07:26,360
No,
most likely you're going to program 

4349
03:07:26,360 --> 03:07:28,311
something where when you going to be,
they're going to probably have to 

4350
03:07:28,311 --> 03:07:31,341
differentiate between what you are and 
what you love and what your memories are

4351
03:07:31,740 --> 03:07:33,560
and all the negative stuff.
Well,

4352
03:07:33,561 --> 03:07:38,561
you,
you're part of what makes you great and 

4353
03:07:38,561 --> 03:07:38,561
your essence,
in my opinion,

4354
03:07:38,561 --> 03:07:39,630
for all three of us,
and I don't know jamie well enough,

4355
03:07:39,631 --> 03:07:42,420
but I'm sure and his is our reaction.

4356
03:07:42,530 --> 03:07:45,450
It part of what a bit part of our 
personalities,

4357
03:07:45,480 --> 03:07:50,480
in my opinion,
is a reaction to our shortcomings is the

4358
03:07:51,121 --> 03:07:56,121
compensation,
the measures we've taken to compensate 

4359
03:07:56,121 --> 03:07:56,121
for our,
uh,

4360
03:07:56,280 --> 03:07:59,310
limitations would not just that your 
experiences,

4361
03:07:59,690 --> 03:08:00,240
the,
the,

4362
03:08:00,260 --> 03:08:03,780
the trials and tribulations,
this failures and successes,

4363
03:08:03,960 --> 03:08:06,750
the struggle,
the struggle defines your personality.

4364
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:11,960
You show me a guy who doesn't do 
anything and I'll show you a guy who 

4365
03:08:11,960 --> 03:08:11,960
can't do anything,
right?

4366
03:08:11,960 --> 03:08:15,660
Yes.
Could you show me a guy who's 

4367
03:08:15,660 --> 03:08:15,660
accomplished all or a woman who's 
accomplished all sorts of things.

4368
03:08:15,660 --> 03:08:18,210
She can continue to accomplish things 
because she knows how to get shit done,

4369
03:08:18,260 --> 03:08:23,260
but she's also learned how to fail and 
be anyone who's successful has failed so

4370
03:08:24,481 --> 03:08:25,350
many times.
Well,

4371
03:08:25,351 --> 03:08:30,351
that's where wisdom comes from.
Wisdom is the acknowledgement not only 

4372
03:08:30,351 --> 03:08:33,801
of your limitations,
but wisdom is also knowing what to do 

4373
03:08:33,801 --> 03:08:37,881
with those limitations until they 
fucking strap you to that machine and 

4374
03:08:37,881 --> 03:08:39,600
shoved those fucking genius thoughts 
right into your dome.

4375
03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:42,450
So that the same as being high though 
all the time.

4376
03:08:42,630 --> 03:08:45,750
Isn't that the same as keeping the dmt 
trip going forever?

4377
03:08:45,780 --> 03:08:50,780
Well,
the dmt trip removes reality as we know 

4378
03:08:50,780 --> 03:08:50,780
it.
That's where it gets weird.

4379
03:08:50,780 --> 03:08:53,460
So another dinette dimension,
right?

4380
03:08:53,610 --> 03:08:54,990
Well,
we don't know that.

4381
03:08:55,200 --> 03:08:58,350
It certainly feels like that.
It could just be hallucinations.

4382
03:08:58,351 --> 03:09:03,351
It could all be going on in your head 
and said what you get because they have 

4383
03:09:03,351 --> 03:09:04,920
ever done you get from it.
I didn't do it on my own for no reason.

4384
03:09:05,180 --> 03:09:10,180
What you.
What you get from it is something that 

4385
03:09:10,180 --> 03:09:13,491
is exactly the same.
Like someone say like maybe it's all in 

4386
03:09:13,491 --> 03:09:14,280
your head when you trip.
Maybe it's not really happening.

4387
03:09:14,281 --> 03:09:16,290
Okay.
May be however,

4388
03:09:16,320 --> 03:09:21,320
the experience is exactly the same.
If you really are going into another 

4389
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:24,711
dimension,
you really are experiencing love in its 

4390
03:09:24,711 --> 03:09:27,411
purest form and forgiveness and just 100
percent wisdom like all the bullshit and

4391
03:09:29,641 --> 03:09:34,641
all the flaws of your thinking and all 
of the ridiculous aspects of the world 

4392
03:09:35,281 --> 03:09:40,260
around you revealed in some wonderful 
dance by gestures who are giving you the

4393
03:09:40,261 --> 03:09:43,350
finger and a never ending complex 
geometric pattern.

4394
03:09:43,710 --> 03:09:46,730
Even if it's not real.
It's still the same experience.

4395
03:09:46,980 --> 03:09:51,980
Like if you really do go to that 
dimension and you really do experience 

4396
03:09:51,980 --> 03:09:54,681
these in incredibly enlightened being 
and they really do instill upon your 

4397
03:09:54,681 --> 03:09:54,681
wisdom and you really

4398
03:09:54,681 --> 03:09:58,180
do hold onto a few grains of sand that 
slips through your fingers.

4399
03:09:58,210 --> 03:10:00,130
Hold onto a little bit of it while 
you're there.

4400
03:10:00,131 --> 03:10:02,260
You got handfuls,
but you just hold onto a little bit.

4401
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:04,500
It's still the same experiences.
Shit's real son.

4402
03:10:04,690 --> 03:10:05,710
Yeah.
It's a little bit like,

4403
03:10:05,711 --> 03:10:09,790
you know what changed?
The way I argue is that somebody said,

4404
03:10:10,090 --> 03:10:15,090
look,
you may think that that person's point 

4405
03:10:15,090 --> 03:10:15,090
of view is shitty or you don't have 
respect for it,

4406
03:10:15,090 --> 03:10:17,350
or they're there.
Maybe they're acting crazy to them.

4407
03:10:17,351 --> 03:10:19,450
Those feelings and emotions are very 
real.

4408
03:10:19,690 --> 03:10:21,390
So if you start the argument by saying 
like,

4409
03:10:21,400 --> 03:10:24,030
that's why if you look at like political
discussions as country,

4410
03:10:24,031 --> 03:10:29,031
it's hilarious.
You get gun rights advocates and you 

4411
03:10:29,031 --> 03:10:29,110
have gun control.
The first thing they do is they go,

4412
03:10:29,111 --> 03:10:31,000
you're a gun nut,
and the other ones go,

4413
03:10:31,001 --> 03:10:32,410
you're a bleeding heart liberal pussy.

4414
03:10:32,830 --> 03:10:34,780
You start the argument there and guess 
what?

4415
03:10:35,070 --> 03:10:35,850
You're.
There's,

4416
03:10:35,910 --> 03:10:40,910
there's no.
Nobody's having a conversation anymore 

4417
03:10:40,910 --> 03:10:43,141
because you just said,
I don't like you atheists and religious 

4418
03:10:43,141 --> 03:10:43,141
people,
religious people,

4419
03:10:43,141 --> 03:10:44,800
feminazis male,
mrs.

4420
03:10:44,860 --> 03:10:49,860
You'll never have a marriage between the
religious people who are very religious 

4421
03:10:49,860 --> 03:10:54,451
and people who are strictly scientific 
because what happens is instead of 

4422
03:10:54,451 --> 03:10:57,790
saying that religious person is 
religious and he gains inspiration and a

4423
03:10:57,791 --> 03:11:02,791
feeling that's very important to that 
person and they're going to guard that 

4424
03:11:02,791 --> 03:11:03,580
feeling because it makes them feel good 
about the world.

4425
03:11:03,970 --> 03:11:06,550
If you come in as an atheist or a 
scientist and say,

4426
03:11:06,610 --> 03:11:08,440
everything about you is bullshit.
Oh,

4427
03:11:08,441 --> 03:11:11,230
that's a big fairytale.
You just shut down the debate.

4428
03:11:11,231 --> 03:11:13,030
You just broke that bridge.
You're never gonna.

4429
03:11:13,140 --> 03:11:14,350
You're never gonna.
See anything.

4430
03:11:14,380 --> 03:11:15,880
You're not going to see that person for 
who they are.

4431
03:11:15,881 --> 03:11:20,881
Never going to understand even if what 
they're experiencing or what they 

4432
03:11:20,881 --> 03:11:22,660
believe in,
what the faith is not real.

4433
03:11:22,870 --> 03:11:27,870
They still can get a tangible benefits 
summit and it can impact their life and 

4434
03:11:27,870 --> 03:11:28,000
so with Israel in a way,
isn't it?

4435
03:11:28,210 --> 03:11:33,210
Well,
it is something that they believe in to 

4436
03:11:33,210 --> 03:11:33,670
the point where it benefits them and it 
can create beautiful things.

4437
03:11:33,700 --> 03:11:35,440
Great pieces of work,
art,

4438
03:11:35,470 --> 03:11:37,960
whatever it might be.
That's my argument about ben carson.

4439
03:11:38,110 --> 03:11:43,110
Ben carson might be a wacky dude who 
doesn't believe in evolution is you had 

4440
03:11:43,110 --> 03:11:47,161
some crazy ideas,
but I like him as much as any of the 

4441
03:11:47,161 --> 03:11:47,161
other people that are running for 
president or dude,

4442
03:11:47,161 --> 03:11:49,960
he's not just smart dude.
One of the best neurosurgeons ever.

4443
03:11:50,020 --> 03:11:51,130
Okay.
Not only that,

4444
03:11:51,250 --> 03:11:56,250
he's really like measured and relaxed 
and calm always because he never gets 

4445
03:11:57,011 --> 03:12:00,580
too high or too emotional.
Like yelling at someone the other day,

4446
03:12:00,820 --> 03:12:05,260
go home and get a job.
This is gonna be our president,

4447
03:12:05,470 --> 03:12:09,640
go home and get a job and all the 
fucking white dudes with golf shirts on.

4448
03:12:11,770 --> 03:12:13,720
He doesn't have his eye.
Whereas his idea,

4449
03:12:13,721 --> 03:12:18,721
his where his ideas for his id.
I'm hoping that once he becomes 

4450
03:12:18,721 --> 03:12:18,760
president because it's going to become 
president,

4451
03:12:18,940 --> 03:12:22,000
then he lets it go.
Because what ben carson said about trump

4452
03:12:22,001 --> 03:12:27,001
that I thought was really fascinating.
He says he's remarkably reasonable when 

4453
03:12:27,001 --> 03:12:27,490
he's not on camera,
and so what?

4454
03:12:27,850 --> 03:12:30,310
Jeff ross told me that too,
because ben's endorsing them now.

4455
03:12:30,430 --> 03:12:35,430
Yeah.
I don't think he's a dumb guy and I 

4456
03:12:35,430 --> 03:12:37,110
think a lot of it's worth.
I think you may see if he becomes 

4457
03:12:38,231 --> 03:12:39,160
president,
two things.

4458
03:12:39,161 --> 03:12:44,161
One is he probably comes,
he's not an idea was so therefore he's 

4459
03:12:44,261 --> 03:12:45,760
not an ideologue,
so he's going to do this.

4460
03:12:45,761 --> 03:12:48,310
I think he will approach everything as a
problem to be solved,

4461
03:12:48,311 --> 03:12:49,660
which is not a bad thing.
Secondly,

4462
03:12:49,870 --> 03:12:52,550
don't be surprised if he surrounds 
himself with very competent,

4463
03:12:52,551 --> 03:12:55,350
smart people who know more than he does,
uh,

4464
03:12:55,370 --> 03:12:58,100
that those are the two silver silver 
linings.

4465
03:12:58,100 --> 03:12:59,900
I can see trump,
uh,

4466
03:13:00,050 --> 03:13:03,380
coming to the pin holes on the.
I don't like the guy.

4467
03:13:03,440 --> 03:13:08,440
He breaks the system because the system 
of special interest groups and the need 

4468
03:13:08,440 --> 03:13:08,630
for this,
this,

4469
03:13:08,640 --> 03:13:11,930
the campaign financing.
When you get a guy like him who doesn't,

4470
03:13:12,110 --> 03:13:14,570
he really can't buy him.
He doesn't benefit.

4471
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:19,860
He has a problem with campaign finance 
reform is that sit with citizens united.

4472
03:13:20,551 --> 03:13:25,551
That supreme court decision giving money
to a political campaign is in the 

4473
03:13:27,770 --> 03:13:30,830
exercise of free speech and it was 
considered constitutional.

4474
03:13:30,831 --> 03:13:34,220
So it's very difficult to get big money 
out.

4475
03:13:34,250 --> 03:13:37,250
But what I do think will happen,
and you're seeing it already with people

4476
03:13:37,251 --> 03:13:39,110
like bernie sanders and even Donald 
Trump,

4477
03:13:39,410 --> 03:13:42,290
is that we as citizens will go,
man,

4478
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:44,510
you have big,
deep pockets,

4479
03:13:44,600 --> 03:13:49,040
deep political pockets,
and so you must be a little corrupt.

4480
03:13:49,041 --> 03:13:51,880
At least I ain't voting for you when 
there's transparency.

4481
03:13:51,890 --> 03:13:56,890
So things like crowdpac where you can go
and find exactly who's financing people 

4482
03:13:56,890 --> 03:14:00,650
crowdpac which my friend steve hilton.
It's good thing you go and check out.

4483
03:14:00,651 --> 03:14:04,490
I mean they've got their website,
has all of the various campaign funds,

4484
03:14:04,491 --> 03:14:04,990
all the,
you know,

4485
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,370
the people that are influencing all the 
special interest groups.

4486
03:14:07,371 --> 03:14:08,300
Love it.
Tight move.

4487
03:14:08,301 --> 03:14:09,830
We got to get the fuck out of here.
Thirty five,

4488
03:14:09,831 --> 03:14:12,540
40.
Come see us in denver through,

4489
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:14,270
through.
We flew through three.

4490
03:14:14,280 --> 03:14:15,950
I really did.
This is a good one.

4491
03:14:16,040 --> 03:14:21,040
Comedy store tonight.
Comedy store to point out that both of 

4492
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:21,040
you bitches peed twice.
I never got up.

4493
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:23,770
Why your strong,
strong piece?

4494
03:14:24,280 --> 03:14:26,900
I have portrayed it from doing the show.
I drank four cups of coffee.

4495
03:14:26,901 --> 03:14:28,720
Sat there and a bottle of kombucha.
You're gay.

4496
03:14:29,060 --> 03:14:34,060
I'm not bragging.
Just probably I could hold up a lot of 

4497
03:14:34,060 --> 03:14:34,060
March 18th.

4498
03:14:34,060 --> 03:14:34,180
March 19th.
It's my bed.

4499
03:14:34,220 --> 03:14:36,320
I say I'm bragging about my ability to 
hold him piss.

4500
03:14:36,370 --> 03:14:39,500
It's things like a baby cam.
Logan.

4501
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:41,870
Logan will be at the comedy store 
tonight.

4502
03:14:41,900 --> 03:14:43,890
Tonight.
Feel von brent earns.

4503
03:14:43,900 --> 03:14:44,900
That's for a good cause,
right?

4504
03:14:44,901 --> 03:14:46,370
Whereas the spinal cord.
Spinal cord.

4505
03:14:46,420 --> 03:14:48,140
The spinal cord injury.
So come by.

4506
03:14:48,230 --> 03:14:53,230
How much of the money goes towards it 
while we were all literally all 

4507
03:14:53,230 --> 03:14:53,870
beautiful but mine.
I'll get mine.

4508
03:14:53,960 --> 03:14:57,600
You get all your money but to all your 
money now just kept loving job.

4509
03:14:57,630 --> 03:15:00,170
We'll do it for charity.
