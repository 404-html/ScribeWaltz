1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:03,971
Sweet,

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,320
bubbly baby Jesus.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,430
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,713
what the fuck?

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,960
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you by

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,510
[inaudible] where space Squarespace.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,500
If you go to squarespace.com forward slash
Joe you can try Squarespace for free.

8
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:27,690
No credit card needed and build
yourself a fucking website son or Gow.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,790
Can't be calling chicks cow or chickson.

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,260
Can't really call them galley to,

11
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:34,210
that's kind of rude anyway,

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,520
squarespace.com is the best resource
I've ever found online for creating a

13
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,970
really cool looking website very easily.

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,950
Any dumdum can do it,

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,630
probably even me.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,920
Brian does them.

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,540
Every time we do a fucking podcast,

18
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,440
he'll throw a new one up.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,980
fart@cocc.com the machine,

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,680
he's creating a machine
website right now as we speak.

21
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:56,950
Yeah.

22
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,670
Okay.

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,270
What does it say?

24
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,740
We're going to just kind of
create a fucking website.

25
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,290
It's super easy to use.

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,320
You can make online stores very easily.

27
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:10,321
All of it is very easy and this is all
stuff that just simply was not available

28
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:11,900
just a few years ago,

29
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:12,551
a few years ago,

30
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,320
if you wanted to get a website done,

31
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:18,040
you either had to hire someone who really
knows how to code and do a website or

32
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,450
master one of those,

33
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:20,040
uh,

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,873
um,

35
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,920
kind of complicated programs
for creating websites.

36
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,500
But Squarespace and makes it super easy.

37
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,030
I learned html right when it,

38
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:29,350
right before it got useless.

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,070
Ah,

40
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,731
did you learn it?

41
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:32,490
The little thing Raf,

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,160
all that.

43
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,280
I learned how to do it and I learned
a few things and then just when they

44
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:36,761
started saying,

45
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:37,750
you don't have to do that anymore,

46
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:38,830
you can just type in the thing.

47
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:39,430
It'll show up.

48
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,420
It's Kinda dope though.

49
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,111
It's Kinda like,

50
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:41,370
um,

51
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,981
I mean I,

52
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:42,814
I've noticed

53
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,780
it's Bert let square per.com

54
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,950
that should so be a website
squirt when he done quickly,

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,391
quickly,

56
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:54,721
Brian,

57
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:56,300
register that scored bird.

58
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,070
Let's squirt burt.com quickly,

59
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:00,420
quickly go to hover.

60
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,720
Um,

61
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,500
if you go to squarespace.com
forward slash Joe and I said,

62
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,980
you can try it out and,

63
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,680
and fuck with it and build a website.

64
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,240
And then if you decide to purchase it,

65
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,940
you use the code Joe Five,

66
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,350
all one word,

67
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:13,581
j,

68
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:15,090
o e and then the number five.

69
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,240
And you can save 10%
off your first purchase,

70
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,320
a new scent,

71
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,030
excuse me,

72
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,580
save 10% off your first
purchase on new accounts,

73
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,560
including monthly and annual plants.

74
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,550
It's really cool website.

75
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,141
Uh,

76
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:27,810
and if you,

77
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,370
if you're interested in
creating your own website,

78
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,630
it really is the way to go.

79
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,490
And you can do it yourself on a budget,

80
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,324
like super easy.

81
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,583
It suites.

82
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,880
We're also brought to you by ting.

83
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,310
Ting is,

84
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,590
I'm a cell phone company that
uses the sprint backbone.

85
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,910
They have the same service
that sprint has as far as uh,

86
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,010
the signal strength and all that jazz.

87
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,900
But the way they have it set up,

88
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,880
they have no contracts.

89
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:54,120
You don't have to have a
contract and you buy your phone.

90
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,200
And if you decide like,

91
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,360
I don't use this anymore,

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,470
you can just quit and cancel it.

93
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,110
You just,

94
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,410
you move on and you're,

95
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,220
you're not connected

96
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,053
to them anymore.

97
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,430
They have the highest level,

98
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,120
uh,

99
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,200
android phones,

100
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,410
including the Samsung Galaxy note to
which is this beastly phone that I,

101
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,880
as soon as I have some fucking
free time getting one of those.

102
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,960
I use Tang like a mother fucker
in Vancouver this weekend.

103
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,560
What's funny is because
I had the a t and t uh,

104
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:25,090
iPhone and the galaxy s
three on Ting and my iPhone,

105
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,450
uh,

106
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,280
my calling plans and everything,

107
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,031
how it was set up,

108
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,920
it would have cost me every
time I downloaded a photo,

109
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,630
it would probably cost me about $60.

110
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,560
Because you were terrified
to use your phone.

111
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:33,770
Yeah.

112
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,520
You're,

113
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:34,911
you're like,

114
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:35,744
please just check.

115
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,801
Give him money.

116
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,320
I had to give him Canadian
money to check his email,

117
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,143
check your email,

118
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,870
give me a hundred dollars
fuck with your brain,

119
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:45,171
man.

120
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:48,650
You let them fuck with your brain when
it's $20 or whatever the fuck it is.

121
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:49,484
You just kind of let it go.

122
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:49,850
Yeah.

123
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,683
What's funny is

124
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,960
using it for brief amounts of time,

125
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,010
I got like two emails from at and t
saying you've already gone over a hundred

126
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,843
dollars in data.

127
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,121
Oh,

128
00:03:59,121 --> 00:03:59,751
it sucks too.

129
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,670
When you sit down and you're
sitting at a bar and you're like,

130
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:01,971
you're like,

131
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:05,180
you think you're on the Wifi and all of
a sudden it just starts pushing all your

132
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:05,510
Twitter.

133
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:05,721
You're like,

134
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:07,090
what the fuck is this?

135
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,690
Yeah,

136
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,380
I do.

137
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,210
You could definitely blow your wad when
you're in a foreign country and you

138
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:11,901
using cell phone,

139
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:12,370
sir.

140
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,330
And what's cool is ting has a page
and see if I can find it for you.

141
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,620
That it just shows you what,

142
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:19,450
what country,

143
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,650
what the rates are in every country.

144
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,930
And it just works like it's,

145
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,010
this is how much it will
cost to check your email.

146
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,300
And it's not like rape.

147
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,453
Uh,

148
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,210
it's not,

149
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,250
they should put that in
there as [inaudible].

150
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,610
We're not raping in
with the word in there.

151
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,120
It's not great money.

152
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,170
Brian red band.

153
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,620
Yeah.

154
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,000
I mean it was on it on,

155
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,500
it was running ting.

156
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,550
That would be commercial.

157
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,230
Find it that I can look at this,

158
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,030
right?

159
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,010
It's not like rape.

160
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,321
Never.

161
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,950
You never use your never used data
plans when you're studying it.

162
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,340
When you're a over abroad,

163
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,770
always use the fucking Wifi at the hotel.

164
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,551
Get all your shit.

165
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,384
Once you get there,

166
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,040
go to Starbucks.

167
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,340
It's really is kind of rude.

168
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:56,910
Okay.

169
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,160
That's for this fucking well,

170
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:00,540
no wonder we're the best in the world.

171
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:00,841
All right,

172
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:01,531
so check this out.

173
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:02,820
Receiving and making calls.

174
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,050
If you're in Canada,

175
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,970
15 cents a minute,

176
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,140
that's pretty legit.

177
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:07,950
You're not usable.

178
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,071
Yeah,

179
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:08,740
that's reasonable.

180
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,760
It goes this and hand it off.

181
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,531
That's a four.

182
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:12,510
And a conversation only cost you,

183
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,141
what is it?

184
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:13,800
60 cents?

185
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,760
Say 15 cents a minute.

186
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:15,331
But here's the good thing.

187
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:19,370
Receiving and sending text messages
that just literally 0 million cents.

188
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,780
Oh,

189
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,611
that's beautiful.

190
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,001
That's great.

191
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:21,960
That's how it should be.

192
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,600
All right.

193
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,050
A one megabyte on a t and t,

194
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,043
uh,

195
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,581
with the,

196
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:31,380
with just a normal calling plan
was $15 and 50 cents per megabyte.

197
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,140
That's how much it costs per megabyte.

198
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,100
Ting.

199
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,830
50 cents.

200
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,970
Yeah,

201
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,803
but let's go.

202
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,201
Let's go.

203
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:38,541
Let's go.

204
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,440
A little fucked up country.

205
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,531
That's hilarious.

206
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:42,010
Yeah,

207
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,780
that's beautiful.

208
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,051
Yeah.

209
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,080
It's calling another
country 15 cents a minute.

210
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,731
I mean it's,

211
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,250
it's,

212
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,370
but it just kind of show
you what the differences is.

213
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,580
I use both phones in Canada and I bet you
my bill on at and t is at least $400 I

214
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,100
bet you my

215
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,470
bill on ting is probably like $7.

216
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,573
I bet you're right.

217
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,923
I bet you're right.

218
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:03,640
Well,

219
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,990
the what tings idea was when,

220
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,830
when they first created their company,

221
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,570
they wanted to have,

222
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:10,960
uh,

223
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,490
an ethical cell phone company.

224
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,390
That's sort of like,

225
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,620
it seems to be their motto.

226
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,680
They want to have cell phones that,

227
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,670
you know are like,

228
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,200
you're not sacrificing the quality of
the device or the quality of the service,

229
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,440
but instead of getting locked
into some stupid ass contract,

230
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:27,700
it kind of feels gross.

231
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,661
You don't have to do that.

232
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:29,500
You leave whenever you want.

233
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,350
They also credit you on unused minutes.

234
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,170
It's beautiful if you use more or less,

235
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,060
rather if you use less than you,

236
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,480
uh,

237
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,650
you had signed up for,

238
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,710
they knock you down to the lower level
and they credit you the difference on

239
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:42,544
your next bill.

240
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:42,821
Like,

241
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,410
no one's trying to rip you off.

242
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,460
They're just trying to give you really
good cell for cell phone service at a

243
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:51,520
reasonable rate and everybody can
be happy instead of being greedy.

244
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,280
Twats everybody literally can be happy.

245
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,030
Um,

246
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,481
they have,

247
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:55,580
uh,

248
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,950
the HTC one too.

249
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:57,970
I see you to have that up there.

250
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,080
You see that thing up in the corner?

251
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,980
That's pretty bad ass.

252
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:01,630
I'm guy had that in
Vancouver the other day.

253
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,060
That's these fucking android phone.

254
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:04,271
Yeah,

255
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:06,090
he's android phones screens.

256
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,341
This one.

257
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:07,320
It was like really huge ones.

258
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,960
That cods fun.

259
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,970
Wow.

260
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,600
Yeah.

261
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,340
The HTC one looks pretty sweet.

262
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,193
There's um,

263
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,440
that new Samsung a five g that they,

264
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:17,900
uh,

265
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,900
just revealed that they're going to have
the capability of downloading an entire

266
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,580
movie in one second.

267
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,001
Oh,

268
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,140
shut the fuck up.

269
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,280
Shut the fuck up.

270
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,140
Oh God.

271
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,550
That just scared the shit out of him.

272
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:30,910
Is that even possible?

273
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,620
Our normal,

274
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,320
our normal Internet can't even do that.

275
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:35,700
Well,

276
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:35,881
no,

277
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,320
it's stronger than the normal internet.

278
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,101
You don't understand.

279
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:39,420
It's like next level shit.

280
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,890
The five g on your cell phone is going
to be stronger than the Internet shut.

281
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:44,791
Oh,

282
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:45,720
it's going to break the Internet.

283
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,500
That's fucking,

284
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
that's when the aliens are coming through.

285
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,120
When you can download a movie in a second,

286
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,440
the aliens will then say,

287
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:52,711
okay,

288
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:56,400
this is a strong enough network for us
to invade and they're just going to just

289
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:58,530
hop into the Internet and that's how
they're going to get into our world.

290
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:58,811
Joe,

291
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,820
you're going to be listening to this
podcast a couple like two years from now

292
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and just laughing at this
because we're like on hg already.

293
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,590
You know what's crazy is if they
had put this in during lunch,

294
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
tomorrow land and Disney
world and they had said it,

295
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,960
it probably wouldn't
impress that many people.

296
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:17,640
But like a jet pack impresses people.

297
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:17,910
Right.

298
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,260
But this is so next level.

299
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,370
It's so next level.

300
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,761
You know,

301
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,770
back when I had a t one line in my house,

302
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,080
um,

303
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,040
I remember when I had that
Brian when I was a quake player.

304
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:26,610
Yeah.

305
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,070
That was the only 1.5 megs.

306
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,570
That shit was nothing.

307
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,650
It was a whack of dishes you can
comparison to now me back down,

308
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:36,030
I was a goddamn superstar.

309
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,530
You know you've got a t one line,

310
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't even know what a t one line is.

311
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,680
It's a fat business internet pipe,

312
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,010
but it's nothing compared to
like Verizon fiber optics.

313
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:44,430
Yes.

314
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,120
Nothing,

315
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,781
nothing.

316
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:50,781
I mean not even fucking close like these
time Warner cable packages we can get

317
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:55,420
like who knows what kind of just
nonsense download speeds there.

318
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,160
They're insane

319
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,120
now you know,

320
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:01,080
you can get like really powerful Internet
that makes a t one line like I had

321
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,240
from like 1998 or something like that.

322
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,910
It makes a t one line
looked like a piece of shit.

323
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,880
I the,

324
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
we were our tea,

325
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,920
our Internet's fucked up in
our neighborhood and they
said it's always going to

326
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,930
be that fucked up cause we
all share off the same server.

327
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,930
And so until they upgrade.

328
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,291
Wait,

329
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:16,741
what are you on?

330
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,470
DSL?

331
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,030
Uh,

332
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,990
I don't know.

333
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,240
Yeah,

334
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,890
DSL.

335
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,400
DSL.

336
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,180
So you don't have cable in
your neighborhood like wired
cable or charter cable?

337
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:24,721
We don't have cable.

338
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,050
We have,

339
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,400
well we have direct TV in our house,

340
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,770
but we don't have cable Internet.

341
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:28,950
Are you sure you don't
have cable internet?

342
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,540
You don't fucking know.

343
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,170
Why are we asking?

344
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,003
Hey,

345
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,000
here's what you did.

346
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,460
You find out which cable company
is connected to your streets.

347
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:37,500
So you probably have Warner or
charter or something like that.

348
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,401
Then you just call him and go,

349
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:38,611
Hey,

350
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,300
I need internet.

351
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,220
They'll come to your house and
give you the fastest Internet.

352
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,620
Even faster than most.

353
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,630
Like 90% of households are
Internet sucks Dick and are rude.

354
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,720
I just told you how to fix it.

355
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,910
Said don't worry about it.

356
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:51,810
You can get done today.

357
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,470
Okay.

358
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,200
I probably won't get it
done today or this week off.

359
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,590
I don't,

360
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,423
I don't live there

361
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,193
anyway.

362
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:04,330
[inaudible] Dot Com save 25 bucks and
that's how you do a commercial debt.

363
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,390
Um,

364
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,390
we're also sponsored by stamps.com
if you go to stamps.com and click on,

365
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,120
there's a microphone in the upper right
hand corner entering the code word,

366
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,601
j,

367
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:21,300
r e and he give you a special offer.

368
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,730
What stamps.com is,

369
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:24,091
first of all,

370
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:24,781
it's to the company.

371
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:25,470
If you,

372
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,450
one of the things we
see at all of our shows,

373
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,690
I see you fucking Weirdos
wearing those kitty cat shirts.

374
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:31,090
It's like a,

375
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,100
it's an outfit.

376
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,611
You know,

377
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:33,271
it's like when,

378
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,830
when death squad fans,

379
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,180
when they come to these comedy shows,

380
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,570
all those shows that all those
shirts rather than Brian makes,

381
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,160
he makes them himself.

382
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,311
He,

383
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:44,640
it's his artwork and then he
sells them through desk squad.

384
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:46,890
Dot TV and when you get them delivered,

385
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:51,891
they come from stamps.com it's way
easier than packaging everything and then

386
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,980
going to the post office and it all
has to get weighed and then you have to

387
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:56,814
figure it out and pay.

388
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,421
This way.

389
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,010
You don't have to deal
with any of that nonsense.

390
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,260
You printed all up on your computer,

391
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:01,920
boom.

392
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,150
Slap it on your package,

393
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,560
leave it out for the post man,

394
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,820
and you're golden.

395
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,460
I got certified jet son.

396
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,430
I got a certified letter today in the
mail and the mail man had to come to my

397
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:13,290
door and had to sign for it type thing.

398
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,183
Are you going to jail?

399
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,360
Maybe?

400
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,661
No,

401
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:16,360
but uh,

402
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,860
uh,

403
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,280
I only had boxers on my
fucking Dick was hanging out.

404
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,380
I was asleep because it was
like eight in the morning.

405
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,900
I signed for it.

406
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,320
My Dick was like hanging out the boxes.

407
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,880
Didn't realize it happened.

408
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,790
I went to bed at four and you know,

409
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,700
like literally was on three hours sleep.

410
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,780
Thought you were coming
on to him and it was like,

411
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,141
all right,

412
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:34,974
let's fucking do that.

413
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,690
Slammed the door behind him.

414
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,000
I helped me just drops,

415
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,550
dropped to his knees,

416
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,980
stood stuck in your flats
at Koc and you're like,

417
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,371
oh,

418
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:42,971
that's what,

419
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:43,804
no,

420
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:44,981
darn it.

421
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:45,814
It was just out.

422
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,130
I didn't mean that.

423
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,491
That would be great.

424
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:50,030
Brian.

425
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,620
He's an Asian guy to his.

426
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:52,250
Yeah.

427
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,090
The other thing for Asian,

428
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,010
if you had to fuck your race,

429
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:55,844
what would it be?

430
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,620
What if you had a or race,

431
00:11:57,621 --> 00:11:58,850
what would it be for Christ Chrysler?

432
00:11:58,851 --> 00:11:59,760
Would you want a goddamn stamps?

433
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,650
The fuck kind of question is that?

434
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,540
How about just treat
them all the same bird?

435
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,010
What did Martin Luther King died for?

436
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:07,341
Nothing.

437
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:09,650
You fuck what I'm talking about?

438
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:11,690
Letting them on a bus when
talking about fucking him.

439
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,260
That's the same one of them in your bed.

440
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,410
The same except them are not young Martin

441
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,360
stamps.com like an eight
the code where a j.

442
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,020

444
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,290

$55 in postdoc coupons.

446
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,770
Free digital scale that you're
not going to use for weed.

447
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:30,790
Wink,

448
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,623
wink.

449
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,800
Don't wait.

450
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,270
May Weigh your weed out on that,

451
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,970
but do weigh your weed.

452
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,781
Okay.

453
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:39,850
Especially if you're putting it
into something as you're cooking it.

454
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:40,690
Don't be stupid.

455
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't go by eyeball.

456
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,430
I don't know what the fuck you're doing.

457
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,500
Too many people don't.

458
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,580
That's why I'm not,

459
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,780
I'm not eating anybody's cookies.

460
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,410
Are you fucked

461
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,243
crazy.

462
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,551
Oh,

463
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,860
I fucked that kind of
putting these cookies.

464
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,060
Yeah.

465
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,080
That Guy Brian had
something and I was like,

466
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:56,651
don't eat it.

467
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,041
And he's like,

468
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:57,531
I want to eat it,

469
00:12:57,531 --> 00:12:57,851
and I'm like,

470
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:59,020
you're fucking crazy.

471
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,190
I'm not touching that shit.

472
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,220
This guy gave me so much
stuff and I was like,

473
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:03,371
dude,

474
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,020
I'm only here for seven more hours.

475
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,110
Yeah,

476
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,690
it's a,

477
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,550
Vancouver is such a fascinating place.

478
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,190
Can go drugs like crazy Canadians.

479
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,480
They're better than Americans.

480
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,170
They are.

481
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:17,471
They are.

482
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:18,840
They're like 20% better there.

483
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,300
Americans,

484
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,600
younger Americans aren't cool as fuck and
that the Canadians aren't Douche bags.

485
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,060
I'm just thinking like the overall
behavior of the people is is better.

486
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,240
It's because the Chinese
are robots in the house.

487
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,270
I think that there's something,

488
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,840
there's so many Chinese people there
that was so interesting when that,

489
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,310
well,

490
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,160
we should talk about this then.

491
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:36,670
Yeah.

492
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,470
That's not why they're so nice.

493
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,130
China's not necessarily known for
being nice and I guess you answered my

494
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,420
question of who was fucking first.

495
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,310
Well,

496
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,330
we need to talk about Vancouver
because I noticed so much stuff.

497
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:47,350
I've researched that shit.

498
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,440
Vancouver is amazing.

499
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,630
Anyway,

500
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,020
where were we?

501
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,610
Stamp Talk Com.

502
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,610
Go fuck yourself like yourself,

503
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,483
Jay already.

504
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,870
Codeword J R II.

505
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,850
That's how you save some money.

506
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:56,690
It's an awesome product.

507
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:57,160
And,

508
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,680
and again,

509
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,910
it is a product that um,

510
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,870
Brian actually uses so
we can talk about it.

511
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,170
All the shit that we talk
about in the podcast,

512
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:07,010
we try,

513
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,500
when we have commercials we try to make,

514
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,660
I mean you've heard it a
million times from me before,

515
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,501
listen all the time,

516
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:16,820
but we try to make sure that nothing
we're selling isn't anything that

517
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:17,900
everything we're selling rather,

518
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,500
uh,

519
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,580
it's something that we would use.

520
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,500
Nothing we're selling is embarrassing.

521
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,870
Nothing we're selling is just bullshit
that you're selling just to make money.

522
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,790
And that goes with a on it.

523
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,400
I smoked too much pot
before the show my throat,

524
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,790
but it's not even that.

525
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,624
It's my throat.

526
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,270
It's very unprofessional,

527
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:39,104
these gentlemen.

528
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,283
Anyway,

529
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,900
uh,

530
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,460
on a.com if you haven't
been there for awhile,

531
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,490
we added a bunch of different foods,

532
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,090
like a buffalo bars and now
we have hemp force bars,

533
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:51,110
hemp protein bars,

534
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,160
really

535
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,510
delicious and their dance,

536
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:54,530
these little fucking things.

537
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,260
If you want something to fill
you up if you're in between,

538
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,850
that's what I use him
for most of the time.

539
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,660
Honestly.

540
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,210
I use him for like if I'm on the golf,

541
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,780
I'm like traveling or something.

542
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,730
Instead of eating a cheeseburger,

543
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,500
I'll eat a cup of those hemp protein bars.

544
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,240
They're little tiny bars and I'm good.

545
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,980
They're just such dense protein.

546
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,271
Um,

547
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:14,780
we also sell like Blendtec
blenders to make smoothies with.

548
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,320
We now have Wallman all
almond cashew butter.

549
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,270
We have a bunch of like really healthy
cool shit like Himalayan salt and killer

550
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:24,104
bee honey.

551
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,040
Um,

552
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,070
and as well as a bunch of
different fitness equipment.

553
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,750
Do you guys do a bulletproof coffee?

554
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,231
Yeah.

555
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:30,381
Yeah,

556
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:31,370
we saw that now dude,

557
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,810
I just had that for the
first time this morning.

558
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,540
If people don't know what
book proof coffee is,

559
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,880
our good pal Dave Asprey,

560
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,810
who I've been going back and forth
with to get him on the podcast.

561
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,051
Again,

562
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:44,150
we're just trying to figure out
a date that works for both of us.

563
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,410
He figured out,

564
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,190
or at least he told us that other
people had figured out that there was

565
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:54,191
something on coffee called Mycotoxins
that a lot of folks are not aware of and

566
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,670
they can exist if coffee
isn't stored correctly.

567
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:00,140
If it's under the wrong conditions,

568
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:04,500
if you know the crop gets infected
with this fungus and that is a,

569
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,220
it exists in a lot of coffee.

570
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,460
And one of the things that
people associate with coffee,

571
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:15,170
like with being like there's crash
and feeling like shit after it's over,

572
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,920
it may very well be that what you're
getting in that experience is the effects

573
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,730
of these mycotoxins,

574
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,170
these,

575
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,320
uh,

576
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,970
these fungal toxins
that are on the coffee.

577
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,160
So not all coffee is created equal.

578
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,720
And what Dave Asprey figured out is
how to get coffee from a single source,

579
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:36,230
meaning the people that grow it are the
people that pick it or the people that,

580
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:36,690
that,

581
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,580
that cook it,

582
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,820
you know,

583
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,120
um,

584
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,700
bacon or whatever the fuck that is.

585
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,680
What do they call it
when they turn coffee,

586
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,281
they call it,

587
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:43,770
they don't roast,

588
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,603
bake it roasted.

589
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,440
And when they do it all together,

590
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,030
they control the process and they
know that they don't have any of these

591
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:51,080
mycotoxins on it.

592
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm still interested to wonder like what
I would like to get somebody from my

593
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,310
Folgers to come in here and be like fuck,

594
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,600
love the guy that I would love to hear
what they say about it to hold uses the

595
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:02,920
wrong company in my opinion.

596
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,860
Like the get a guy who
there's the exact same thing.

597
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:06,760
No,

598
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,511
no but like there,

599
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:10,150
there are coffee
[inaudible] like the dudes,

600
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,660
I got a guy that worked on travel channel
till you didn't even stumble with that

601
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:15,530
work and practice that word for a reason.

602
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,530
But I'm talking about mass market.

603
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:19,210
Like people like if this is all true,

604
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:22,780
like somebody that delivers mass amounts
of it but you don't want them cause

605
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:23,320
they're never,

606
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,131
they're never going to be honest.

607
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:25,300
Starbucks would be a great president.

608
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:25,721
Starbucks,

609
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,370
they're never going to be
honest with you about anything.

610
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:28,480
You're going to talk to them
and they're going to go,

611
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,070
well we don't have those.

612
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,980
Microtoxins you want to talk to a
guy who has no affiliation with it?

613
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,431
Not even,

614
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:33,731
I mean not,

615
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:34,660
I'm not going to test it.

616
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,040
It is what

617
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,491
you want to do.

618
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:36,690
You don't want to tell it to anybody,

619
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,490
which you want to do is you
want to go to Starbucks,

620
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,980
you want to pick up a bag of
coffee and you want to go test it.

621
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,400
Yeah.

622
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,260
Until then everyone's just talking shit.

623
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,530
So I hope Dave Asprey comes on
and drop some knowledge on us.

624
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,780
But what I do know is that his his,

625
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,490
which is this combination

626
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,800
of what he calls upgraded coffee,

627
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,040
which is single source coffee when you
know it doesn't have any mycotoxins on it

628
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,220
and grass fed butter along with MCT
oil and he blends it up in one of those

629
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,800
Blendtec blenders and
it's fucking sensational.

630
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,221
That's great.

631
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:05,851
So good.

632
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,480
If it gives you energy
for like a long time.

633
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,241
It's really weird.

634
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:15,060
It has a much more prolonged effect
because of the MCT oil apparently and the

635
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:15,894
grass fed butter,

636
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,430
like all the richness of it.

637
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,830
It's a slower digesting sort of thing.

638
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,770
A tutor for the first
time today and my wife,

639
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,401
my wife,

640
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,690
I pulled it out and I
had heard it from here.

641
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:25,610
They will come to my show in
Portland and gave me a box,

642
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,533
a bag,

643
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:26,991
and I was like,

644
00:18:26,991 --> 00:18:28,120
fucking so pumped you.

645
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,881
I went and bought,

646
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:29,840
we don't have a coffee maker.

647
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,500
We have that,

648
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:30,980
you know that?

649
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,590
Click it in the little pods.

650
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,920
I liked it.

651
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,540
I had to go buy a fucking French Press.

652
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,520
I had to grind it up kind
of rough and I did it.

653
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,363
It was like,

654
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,380
and my wife and I had it.

655
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,280
I fuck him.

656
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,791
And they said,

657
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,660
you don't eat much.

658
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,270
I fucking ate like a
little bit of salmon today.

659
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,410
Some egg whites this morning.

660
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:46,610
I'm fucking set.

661
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,100
I fucking love that shit
and I'm going to buy it.

662
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,680
Well it's,

663
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,680
it's really rich in fats with
the MCT oil and with the er,

664
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,800
the grass fed butter when
all that together is,

665
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,910
is blended in with the coffee.

666
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:00,691
You have to think about it.

667
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,640
That shit takes a long time to digest.

668
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,260
So as is digesting,

669
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,420
it's slowly releasing caffeine,

670
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,651
you know,

671
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:09,780
so it's all mixed in together.

672
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,140
It's a slow roll instead of
just the coffee by itself.

673
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,870
At least this is the theory behind it.

674
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,841
Whatever it is,

675
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,070
it does have an effect.

676
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,910
They're feeding beef.

677
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,650
They're feeding cows.

678
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,520
Uh,

679
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,010
the same Omega threes that are in Salmon,

680
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,370
so now meet will have the exact
same effect that salmon has on you.

681
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,150
Wow.

682
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,480
Yeah.

683
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,220
My wife just told me it's like
coming out in like two weeks.

684
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,410
That's not good for fish because they're
already on shaky ground for pork farm

685
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:36,260
raised salmon,

686
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:39,990
fucking looking fucking
lizards have the sea creeps.

687
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,720
All creeps.

688
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,701
You know,

689
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:44,540
of the things I realized
when I started fishing,

690
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:44,870
I love,

691
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,770
I used to love fishing,

692
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,930
but when I would go fishing for
Bass and they would sell bass lures,

693
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,311
and I was like,

694
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:52,461
well,

695
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:53,294
what does that,

696
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,570
they're supposed to be like a bass
fingerling like right out of the mother's

697
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:57,404
womb.

698
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,370
So because,

699
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:58,531
uh,

700
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,364
and you know,

701
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,010
they have eggs and I'll have a womb,

702
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,251
you know,

703
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:03,860
they just ship the acts and the dude
comes on it and then they leave the little

704
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:04,700
fuckers on their own.

705
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,370
But the male basketball
oftentimes eat them.

706
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:07,880
Oh,

707
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,050
wouldn't it be great if women did
that if like they did to eight,

708
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,913
somebody who's baggies?

709
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,091
No,

710
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:13,710
they leave their eggs in the side of
a bar and then in order to have it,

711
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,301
maybe I have to go,

712
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:15,134
come on it.

713
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,500
No,

714
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,310
that's terrible.

715
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,080
But then you could fuck them all you
want and you don't have to worry about

716
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:18,690
getting pregnant.

717
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,040
The only time that works,

718
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,580
the only reason why they do that
is when where you live is so bad.

719
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:25,830
Like it makes Detroit look like the,

720
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,200
the cushiest fucking
spot on earth say you,

721
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:29,930
you fuck,

722
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,763
oh dare you.

723
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,501
If you,

724
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:32,550
I mean fish,

725
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:33,900
it's life is so fucked up.

726
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,310
They can't even just chill.

727
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,870
They got to go hit the baby

728
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,130
when the baby's crack out of the eggs.

729
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,050
Oftentimes the hungry bass were like,

730
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:46,381
fuck it.

731
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:47,214
I'll just eat one of these.

732
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:47,840
And they'll just,

733
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,880
they'll eat their own kits.

734
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,890
They're conti little animals.

735
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,230
And as soon as cows can do the same thing,

736
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:53,581
that fish,

737
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:54,414
the fish are fucked.

738
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:54,791
Oh,

739
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,070
can you imagine if you drive
a vase or a cow eating a calf?

740
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,150
Whoa.

741
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,660
You'd stop.

742
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,493
Should they do it?

743
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,660
I'm sure the placenta.

744
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,183
The horse.

745
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,491
Yeah,

746
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:03,731
I know,

747
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,950
but I mean a lot of animals
eat their own placenta.

748
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,211
A lot of animals,

749
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,890
a lot of women's posts supposedly do that.

750
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,070
It's supposed to be healthy for you.

751
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:12,580
It actually people like
cook it out of humans.

752
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,690
They have um,

753
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,231
they've taken it.

754
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,820
We were actually going to
do that on a fear factor,

755
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:17,560
but that was one of the
things they rejected.

756
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,480
They said no to placenta.

757
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:19,811
Yes,

758
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,321
yes.

759
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,210
To come and urine.

760
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,891
Way to go.

761
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:24,790
And Vc,

762
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,650
wait wasn't NBC,

763
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,750
I mean it was individuals that work there.

764
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,580
I'm just saying nothing makes sense.

765
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,780
Bitches on a.com.

766
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:32,614
Oh and yeah.

767
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,200
Chimpanzee Kettle vow for,

768
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:37,420
yeah,

769
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,550
get some primal bells.

770
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:38,880
We hit,

771
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,280
we were in the middle of commercial
and we had a talk about coffee.

772
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,770
Are you going to do desk squad
kettlebells where it's our likenesses.

773
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,130
We thought about doing a Joey
d as a hundred pound would be,

774
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:47,440
oh,

775
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,480
sleeving sourced it.

776
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,261
We haven't sourced it,

777
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:50,280
but it would be a real issue.

778
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,980
We'd have to go and take his
head and we'd have to like put,

779
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,850
put his head in a mold and Skype being,

780
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,980
but it's on your face.

781
00:21:58,981 --> 00:21:59,731
It's a bigger deal.

782
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:00,361
I think it's a set.

783
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,890
You get a five pound kettle bell.

784
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:02,840
That's Brian.

785
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,550
Joelle can get this fucking
thing off my head right now.

786
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:06,384
Pound Kettle Bell,

787
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,490
the donkey walking out
with my fucking head.

788
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:09,324
You Momo

789
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
on a.com.

790
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,690
Use the code name rogue and save
yourself some money for Christ.

791
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:14,310
You see her?

792
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,830
We're fixing.

793
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,663
Get busy.

794
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,070
We're fixing a party.

795
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:17,970
You've fucks

796
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,410
Joe Rogan experience Joe
Rogan podcast by night.

797
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,190
Powerful Bert Kreischer the traveling.

798
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,010
This man.

799
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,730
I know the face of the
travel channel itself.

800
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,950
Every time I go to the travel channel,

801
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:42,190
I see your fucking face Bert
Kreischer right in the camera.

802
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,850
Thank God I fucking lost
weight before this season.

803
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,141
So pig is fucking,

804
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:48,160
I look at pictures of me.

805
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,590
There was a guy that had
a picture of me from,

806
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,643
had Philly,

807
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,610
I guess a year ago.

808
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,450
Yeah.

809
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,610
I was huge man.

810
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,780
To be going off to 15 we hit in the sauce,

811
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:56,900
hitting the sauce,

812
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,770
hard blues.

813
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,580
It was the booze and eat whatever the
fuck you want at the end of the night.

814
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:01,260
Yeah,

815
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,093
yeah,

816
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,880
yeah,

817
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,240
yeah.

818
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,510
No,

819
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,360
no better way to throw a fucking
monkey wrench in your metabolism.

820
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:08,110
Right.

821
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,943
Dude,

822
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,820
it's funny.

823
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,100
It's funny you get you.

824
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,060
You get used to feeling sick so much.

825
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:13,421
Yeah.

826
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:15,040
You just get used to that sick feeling.

827
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:15,671
Well,

828
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,230
if you're hung over all the time,

829
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,550
that becomes your reality.

830
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,453
Yeah.

831
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,420
A lot of people you
know that you see on TV.

832
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,870
Yeah.

833
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,501
What the fuck are you doing?

834
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,840
A lot of people that you see on TV that,

835
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:27,674
uh,

836
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,281
what are you doing,

837
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,114
Bryan?

838
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,440
I'm just fixing a camera.

839
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,370
Okay.

840
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,203
Oh,

841
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:32,630
okay.

842
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,690
This is a lot of people like,

843
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,830
like Bordain.

844
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,420
You can always tell board dames hung over.

845
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,283
He looks at him.

846
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,350
I saw his new show on CNN.

847
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,450
He looks for some for the first time.

848
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:44,760
He looks like it looks like the
roads taken the tear on him.

849
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,310
Yeah.

850
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,491
Oh,

851
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:46,070
it's been taking

852
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,903
in Toronto for a year.

853
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,310
God,

854
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,780
man.

855
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:47,980
Yeah.

856
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,461
That's a hard,

857
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,080
he's the canary in the
mine for guys like me.

858
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,410
It's a hard life and a,

859
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,660
if you want to do it Busan,

860
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,543
it's even harder.

861
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:54,830
Yeah.

862
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,210
Now you want to travel the time flying
planes and hit the sauce whenever

863
00:23:58,211 --> 00:23:59,044
possible,

864
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,520
but you know,

865
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,960
health be damned.

866
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,830
That's the fun way.

867
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,490
Do it.

868
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,323
What do you want to hear?

869
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,410
What do you want to go out like,

870
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:05,860
uh,

871
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,160
like,

872
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,461
like,

873
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:07,030
uh,

874
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,560
like who's the fucking preacher?

875
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,340
Joel Asprey.

876
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,790
Joel,

877
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,240
Joel,

878
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,020
Joel s.

879
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,711
What's that guy's name?

880
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:12,700
Joel Osteen.

881
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:18,190
Joel host or you never watch those
like those Sunday preachers that are,

882
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,130
that,

883
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,880
that they preached in Atlanta
to those mega churches.

884
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,720
Joel Olsteen.

885
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,051
Oh,

886
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:23,884
one of those guys.

887
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,360
O'Steen who looks great.

888
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:26,200
Probably 50 years old.

889
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,420
Or do you want to go out like Anthony
Bourdain where at your funeral?

890
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:30,910
Everyone's like in kind
of lived a fucking life.

891
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,220
He's a fucking great writer.

892
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,050
Amazing talent.

893
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,221
He knows.

894
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:37,870
He makes TV fucking good.

895
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,370
It's so hard to make good TV.

896
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:39,730
I don't,

897
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,020
I,

898
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,050
I will say candidly,

899
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:41,884
I don't do it,

900
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,990
but like I make mediocre TV.

901
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:47,470
I make TV that you don't teach a
channel four but he made good TV

902
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,260
dude and the dude goes hard.

903
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:49,800
Okay.

904
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,270
He showed up and uh,

905
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,531
we,

906
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,660
we passed the joint when,

907
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,800
when he did the podcast and there's,

908
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,550
there's a few guys that didn't,

909
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,500
didn't make it that
went down that journey.

910
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,470
There's a few in the history of the
podcast that tried to get high with us and

911
00:25:01,471 --> 00:25:03,630
then just the whole
podcast went into a tank.

912
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,700
It just spiraled out of control.

913
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,120
Stan hope I heard that one.

914
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,490
Oh that was my shirts.

915
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,830
It was a combination mushrooms
and we got them high.

916
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,051
Yeah.

917
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,060
Cause I remember I was,

918
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,000
I was on a treadmill that day and I
could hear him breathing in the mic and I

919
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:16,570
was like,

920
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,790
I was laughing hysterically

921
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,960
standing up so crazy.

922
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,131
Yeah.

923
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:23,760
He doesn't like the weed but,

924
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,270
but Bordain Bordain went deep,

925
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,400
really fucking hung in there.

926
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,690
Every God damn stroke.

927
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,650
I was amazed.

928
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,490
I was amazed.

929
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,390
And then when we sat down,

930
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:33,950
clearly do was barbecued.

931
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,220
He Wa he wanted more a,

932
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,370
I feel like to this day,

933
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,050
like it wasn't like the best host.

934
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,610
And knowing when a guy wants a beer,

935
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,593
you know,

936
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,291
he's such a,

937
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,071
he's so polite.

938
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:43,461
He wouldn't say,

939
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:43,730
okay,

940
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,570
you know the one of these,

941
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,590
like Brian had to go,

942
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,000
I think he just Klinkt is beers together.

943
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,241
They're like,

944
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:48,130
he's looking at an empty bay.

945
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,961
It's hard to host.

946
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:52,800
He shows up drunk,

947
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,760
like if you'd been drinking.

948
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,990
Anytime I take take a drink,

949
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,350
I always feel like I'm
slurring my words overwhelming.

950
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,270
I can't even do like I
can do your podcast drunk,

951
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,390
but I can't do mine drunk
because you can totally tell.

952
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:03,841
Well,

953
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:04,674
I'm the same way.

954
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,380
Yours drunk too.

955
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:08,080
Like you have to pay attention.

956
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,190
It's your podcast.

957
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,610
You ultimately have to afford.

958
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,444
It was guided in,

959
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,201
you know,

960
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:15,320
we'll set it loose and then guide at
home and then park it and wrap it up at

961
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:18,110
night where you have to think
about that when it's yours.

962
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:19,220
But if it's not yours,

963
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,390
you're free to just be,

964
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:21,380
oh yeah.

965
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:21,951
Yeah.

966
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:22,940
So even if you're hammered,

967
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,481
you're like,

968
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,130
who cares?

969
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,650
I'm bringing in my trainer
this week and bringing him in.

970
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,030
I'm bringing my trainer into the room.

971
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,850
He's gay.

972
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,510
I'm going to talk to them about being gay
and then he's going to make me run for

973
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:32,344
30 minutes.

974
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:32,950
I need a beer.

975
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,783
Can I get up here?

976
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,120
We might need to,

977
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,831
what's going on?

978
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:38,170
Gay dudes are to open up his name.

979
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,181
Christopher Walker.

980
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,014
He's gonna be like,

981
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:42,923
Oh man,

982
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,701
the next day.

983
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:46,091
And he's like,

984
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:46,601
listen man,

985
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,460
I'm thinking about adopting a stage name

986
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,503
podcast.

987
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,070
I don't want this to affect.

988
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:52,550
He's getting,

989
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:57,550
I want hundreds of thousands of random
strangers also knowing that I'm gay.

990
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,110
I'm not scared about,

991
00:26:59,111 --> 00:26:59,944
you know,

992
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,821
he's a,

993
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:01,511
he's really cool.

994
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:02,171
He's from England,

995
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:03,720
he's kind of a stud and uh,

996
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,050
he is definitely a stud.

997
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:06,640
Does that for me or how's this work?

998
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,120
Is Alcoholic son.

999
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:08,830
All right.

1000
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,221
So,

1001
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:10,054
um,

1002
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,450
and so he's going to get
me on my treadmill and he's
going to run me through one

1003
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:14,440
of his 30 minute runs,

1004
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,700
like the speeds and everything,

1005
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,880
and then I can then see if
they can keep up with me.

1006
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:19,661
Oh,

1007
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:19,871
okay.

1008
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:20,620
That's kind of fun.

1009
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,180
Yeah.

1010
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,821
You know what I did?

1011
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:24,700
I had a chiropractor come in and do
a podcast where the chiropractor,

1012
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:25,540
while he adjusted me,

1013
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,830
and a lot of people were like,

1014
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,401
you know,

1015
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:27,990
like,

1016
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,310
uh,

1017
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,930
like,

1018
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,990
like it was different and it was
a cool to do something different.

1019
00:27:31,991 --> 00:27:32,501
And I was like,

1020
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:32,800
yeah.

1021
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,400
And so I was like,

1022
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,380
I'm always gonna try to throw
something interesting in there.

1023
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,740
I love sitting and talking with dudes,

1024
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,600
but sometimes it's like,

1025
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,460
you know,

1026
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,180
it's like I'm not that
great of an interviewer.

1027
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,440
I like talking over people.

1028
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,860
That's a common one that takes a while
to figure out how to manage and it's

1029
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:48,694
like,

1030
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,621
it's hard because you,

1031
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:50,260
you got to,

1032
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,580
it's hard to both listen and think
about what you're going to say as well.

1033
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,653
You know?

1034
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,050
That's,

1035
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,480
that's the issue with people talking
over people is they just can't hold onto

1036
00:27:59,530 --> 00:27:59,681
it.

1037
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:01,180
So they got to get it out right away.

1038
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,051
You know?

1039
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:02,261
Like,

1040
00:28:02,261 --> 00:28:03,310
especially if you're,

1041
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,600
if you're just riffing,

1042
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,720
like sometimes when you're riffing,

1043
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,190
like the idea comes and you
don't mean to cut somebody off,

1044
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:13,540
but you do like it takes a while to
figure out how to not do that because it

1045
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:17,560
really is a matter of managing those
two very specific and very different

1046
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:17,861
things.

1047
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:22,861
Listening and talking and then combining
them together in the third thing,

1048
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,450
which is a real conversation like did to,

1049
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:28,300
the grossest thing is talking to someone
when you know they're not really having

1050
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:29,200
a conversation with you.

1051
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,460
Like maybe they have like a preplanned
talking points and they might get them

1052
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,640
out and then stop and then get them out
again and then stop and then you realize

1053
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:37,090
like,

1054
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,331
okay,

1055
00:28:37,331 --> 00:28:38,860
you're not even dancing with me here.

1056
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:39,510
Yeah,

1057
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:39,840
you,

1058
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,331
you got to,

1059
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:42,340
I mean it's one thing to
have a thought in your head.

1060
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,350
It's another thing to have a script like,

1061
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:45,190
and what you're doing here,

1062
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,030
it's like a script.

1063
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,460
This isn't like a thought
in your head like,

1064
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:47,690
well,

1065
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:47,831
Hey,

1066
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:48,820
this is my point of view.

1067
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:50,320
Thank you as a person.

1068
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:51,141
Let's have a communicate.

1069
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:51,401
You know,

1070
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:51,671
let's,

1071
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:52,480
let's talk.

1072
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,000
But sometimes when you're talking to
them you realize like this isn't a real

1073
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:55,834
conversation.

1074
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,040
This is like an act.

1075
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,870
I remember when I first did I apply that
to stand up sometimes I remember I was

1076
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:04,140
doing a audition,

1077
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,891
not on an addition.

1078
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:05,880
Meet Patrice enrich false.

1079
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:08,700
We're auditioning to see if we
could go to Scotland together.

1080
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,380
This is when I was young and I had like,

1081
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,290
I had to do 15 minutes and that was a
lot for me and I had him all the jokes on

1082
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,910
the list and I had less.

1083
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:16,050
Next thing I was like going over it,

1084
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:16,830
going over it.

1085
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,720
And Patrice is like,

1086
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,370
I was at this and I said,

1087
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,741
Danny goes,

1088
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,251
let me see it.

1089
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:21,550
And so I gave it to him
and he ripped it off.

1090
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,681
I go,

1091
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:23,580
why don't you do that man,

1092
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,181
I'm fucked now.

1093
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:24,511
And he goes,

1094
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:25,261
just talk.

1095
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:26,280
No one wants to hear you.

1096
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:28,020
Practice jokes on stage.

1097
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,440
So I had to grow up and
just fucking just go,

1098
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:31,770
all right,

1099
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,450
I'll just do talk for 15
minutes about whatever.

1100
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:36,810
And it was so much fucking better
than had I run down a set list.

1101
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,040
But,

1102
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,701
and so then I,

1103
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:41,980
nowadays it's like every set I've
ever done now is just fucking

1104
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,470
speaking and hoping I get
from one place to another.

1105
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,040
I would not have been happy if
someone tore up my set list.

1106
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,780
I gotta Tell Ya,

1107
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,130
Oh,

1108
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,150
that's bullshit.

1109
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,740
He's also six,

1110
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:51,900
seven and 350

1111
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,430
both.

1112
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,540
I don't think you see,

1113
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,820
I don't think there's anything
wrong with writing things out,

1114
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,470
but I think you'll also,

1115
00:30:00,471 --> 00:30:01,520
when you go on stage,

1116
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,660
that's when you gotta be free.

1117
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,740
It'd be free of it.

1118
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:07,640
But the more you rehearse it or
practice it over and over in your mind.

1119
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,120
I've been like real adamant about
that over the last few years.

1120
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,710
I think it's made a big difference
over the last year that I,

1121
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:19,100
I write down like almost all my bits
over and over and over again when I'm

1122
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:20,390
working on like a new set,

1123
00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:21,920
like a new sound like
I'm working on right now,

1124
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,390
completing a new hour,

1125
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,770
which is pretty done.

1126
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:25,760
Um,

1127
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,250
I write out each bit over
and over and over again.

1128
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:31,970
So my my notebook literally I
would look like a mad person.

1129
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,610
Same thing over and over and over again.

1130
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:35,661
You know,

1131
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:38,420
it's all ridiculous subjects as it is,

1132
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:39,710
but it's the same things.

1133
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:41,850
It's like all work and no
play makes jack a dull boy,

1134
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:42,470
you know?

1135
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,850
Yeah.

1136
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,800
Well you said you used to do something
that I never understood until I,

1137
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,670
until I wrote my book wasn't that it was
like you would say you would actually

1138
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:48,941
write,

1139
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:51,900
you would turn to get out of that sleep
thing on your computer so you would call

1140
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,450
right room,

1141
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,210
right room and you'd write and you'd
write and you'd like it help you.

1142
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:56,020
It really helps you work out.

1143
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,400
You jokes.

1144
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,250
In my head I was like,

1145
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,001
I was like,

1146
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:58,721
that sounds good for him,

1147
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:01,660
but that'll never work for me because I
write on stage so I'm better on stage.

1148
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,510
But then I had to write
like flying dildos,

1149
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:06,040
which is not making it into the book.

1150
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,551
I wrote,

1151
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:08,980
wrote it out as a story and I was like,

1152
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,970
fuck man,

1153
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,230
you've really,

1154
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,500
when you are forced to sit and write
things down and write it out long form,

1155
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,910
you come up with so many more tags.

1156
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,350
So it's such a better story.

1157
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,100
I wrote the machine story and
just for the book and it was like,

1158
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,840
I,

1159
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,770
I'm telling you what to say this,

1160
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,990
this for the first time this week.

1161
00:31:28,991 --> 00:31:31,720
And I will say that is a good
fucking story on stage now.

1162
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,200
Like I,

1163
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,400
and I've been doing it for a while,

1164
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,990
but it's like just writing it,

1165
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,243
you really,

1166
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,750
it makes you think of everything.

1167
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,321
You're like,

1168
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:38,501
fuck,

1169
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,450
I need to fill up a room
and used to be 16 pages.

1170
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:41,284
Like,

1171
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,100
but so now I'm,

1172
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,190
now I'm at this place where I want
to write everything I fucking have.

1173
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,360
It's um,

1174
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,721
it,

1175
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,460
it applies with almost everything.

1176
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,230
Attention and focus.

1177
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,380
You get better at things and you don't
get better by sort of ignoring even

1178
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:57,880
things that you already know.

1179
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,900
Being lazy to go over it.

1180
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,100
Yeah.

1181
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,351
Yeah.

1182
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:02,950
There's a lot of theirs theirs
look like stand up itself.

1183
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,980
Like there's all sorts of times where
you're going to come up with something

1184
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:11,680
that just didn't exist just out of a
conversation and it's great and it's

1185
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:12,130
awesome.

1186
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,750
And then you bring it
on stage and Holy Shit,

1187
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:14,740
it's my new great bit.

1188
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:15,850
I said this really funny thing,

1189
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,070
we're hanging out the other
day and it became a great bit.

1190
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,480
But that doesn't mean that you can't
also get shit by sitting down and doing

1191
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:23,650
that boring work.

1192
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,370
Yeah,

1193
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,450
like the boring work,

1194
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:26,284
whatever it is.

1195
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,790
There's an awesome book on this,

1196
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,020
I mentioned a million times,

1197
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:29,860
but if you haven't heard it,

1198
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:33,970
it's called the war of art by a guy named
Steven Pressfield talked about silver

1199
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:34,510
book.

1200
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,380
It's amazing book.

1201
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,310
Fucking love that book.

1202
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,190
And what it's about is about overcoming
resistance in that sometimes,

1203
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,870
and it's not just about writing man,

1204
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:43,220
it can be about losing weight.

1205
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,330
It could be about not,

1206
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,901
you know,

1207
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:46,630
like getting out of your house and,

1208
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,630
and fucking,

1209
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:47,930
uh,

1210
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,010
not being a Weirdo.

1211
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,840
Like you can get stagnant,

1212
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,100
you can get stuck,

1213
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,780
you can get trapped in a pattern.

1214
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,980
And it's also easy to get trapped in
a pattern where you sabotage yourself.

1215
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,431
You know,

1216
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:00,260
and that that happens
with a lot of people.

1217
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:02,870
A lot of what you do every day,

1218
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,100
you know that you've reached you di you
hadn't done is you sabotaging yourself.

1219
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,020
And it's an usually like in a
response to pressure or response to,

1220
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,740
you know,

1221
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:12,981
uh,

1222
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,060
overwhelming,

1223
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,660
uh,

1224
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,030
obligations or things along those lines.

1225
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,400
You know,

1226
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,960
people look for distractions to take
themselves away from the pressure of life,

1227
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,760
but instead he,

1228
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,271
you know,

1229
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:24,430
he sort of,

1230
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:24,770
uh,

1231
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,420
emphasizes how satisfying it is to embrace
it and to be a professional and just

1232
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:30,380
sit down and do the work.

1233
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:30,951
Just do it.

1234
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:31,850
And this is what you do.

1235
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,430
This is how you,

1236
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,191
is your ethic,

1237
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:34,240
hard to do that.

1238
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,141
It's hard to do,

1239
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:36,940
but it's super satisfying to do.

1240
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,020
You probably know this,

1241
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,000
you probably haven't been dealing
this with us for a long time,

1242
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:43,750
but I heard Amy Schumer on Bobby
Kelly's podcast talk about what,

1243
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,900
how difficult being a
hundred percent busy.

1244
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,720
It's like when you have like a TV show
and you're doing the road and you're

1245
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:51,550
doing a tour and you're doing
everything and I was like,

1246
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:51,701
wow,

1247
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:56,080
I really connect with that because I had
always been the comic and I think the

1248
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:57,400
majority of our friends are,

1249
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,420
I have dealt with this too,

1250
00:33:58,421 --> 00:33:58,870
Ari,

1251
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,530
Joey,

1252
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,281
a Dunkin,

1253
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:03,520
every dude is that do that fucks around
all day and then at night you got like

1254
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:07,300
15 to do 15 minutes or 20 minutes and
then you've done the work for the day.

1255
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,111
Maybe you have a day job,

1256
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:09,040
maybe you audition,

1257
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,690
but as far as like working from eight
in the morning until fucking 11 number

1258
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,573
every night.

1259
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,853
Overwhelming.

1260
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:15,611
Yeah,

1261
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:16,960
like having a TV job.

1262
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:18,850
You mean for what?

1263
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:22,990
Amy's still in is way harder than most
because she's trying to do a sketch show.

1264
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,250
The sketch shows.

1265
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,930
We did that with the man show.

1266
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:26,320
Those.

1267
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,500
Those are not easy to do by
any stretch of the imagination.

1268
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,100
There's a lot of work and there's
a lot of politicking that goes on.

1269
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:36,190
That shit can be really stressful
because everybody doesn't agree.

1270
00:34:36,191 --> 00:34:36,371
You know,

1271
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:37,870
this guy is going to have one vision,

1272
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,440
he's going to have another vision and
you get together and that this fucking

1273
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:43,450
producer doesn't agree with the network.

1274
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,040
Who thinks that you go this way and,

1275
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,710
and then you got to go
on stage that night,

1276
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,220
man,

1277
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,760
you're gonna,

1278
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,930
you're gonna have nothing left.

1279
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,531
She came,

1280
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:51,820
she came to my Portland show,

1281
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,270
my late Portland Shell showed up and you
could see it in her eyes like it's time

1282
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:56,104
to fucking party.

1283
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,300
And she even said,

1284
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,020
oh,

1285
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,441
I know Amy.

1286
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:00,550
I can say what or anything like that.

1287
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:01,120
She goes,

1288
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,340
hey,

1289
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,560
you have acute future feature.

1290
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,221
And I'm like,

1291
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:03,670
what?

1292
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,001
She's like,

1293
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,080
I'm looking to have somebody

1294
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,540
he didn't.

1295
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,100
She didn't because I did not,

1296
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,310
well,

1297
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,750
doesn't she have a boyfriend?

1298
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,110
No.

1299
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,280
That's also a famous guy.

1300
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:13,730
Nope,

1301
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,563
they don't do that anymore.

1302
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,350
Eating anymore.

1303
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,183
Oh yeah.

1304
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,510
But aren't they always on it?

1305
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,351
I think,

1306
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:18,591
you know,

1307
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:20,900
I think they're just regular adults.

1308
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,760
Just regular adults.

1309
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,520
She didn't cheat anyone,

1310
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,550
so it doesn't really matter.

1311
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,451
And she might've been saying it,

1312
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:26,870
the joke,

1313
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,081
you know,

1314
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:27,480
look,

1315
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,750
you're trying to get them on and talking
about getting everybody in trouble

1316
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:30,180
here.

1317
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,520
Yeah.

1318
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,910
Talk about that shit on the podcast.

1319
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,241
Yeah.

1320
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:33,170
Amy was a fun,

1321
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:33,470
we got,

1322
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:33,831
we got,

1323
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,720
we drank in my hotel room
until four in the morning.

1324
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,563
She's a real comic.

1325
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,380
She really is.

1326
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:37,770
Yeah.

1327
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,040
She's

1328
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,850
the legit,

1329
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,420
you know,

1330
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,340
and whether or not that
TV show works out for her.

1331
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:41,720
She's a,

1332
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,570
she's a real comic.

1333
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,433
It's a good show.

1334
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,663
I bet it is.

1335
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,960
She's funny as shit man.

1336
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:46,860
But you know,

1337
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:47,880
whatever she does,

1338
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,743
it should be awesome.

1339
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,020
Yeah.

1340
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,380
She's,

1341
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,213
she's legit.

1342
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,641
You know,

1343
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,420
if you're funny,

1344
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,140
you're funny.

1345
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,550
She reminds me of my oldest daughter.

1346
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,370
Really?

1347
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:54,550
They,

1348
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,180
they,

1349
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,050
they have a,

1350
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,210
she has a blue jumper,

1351
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,970
like a baby blue jumper that she,

1352
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,600
Amy,

1353
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,160
when we used to,

1354
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,780
we worked on a show together that
she wore one time and I went,

1355
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,350
I thought,

1356
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,260
I haven't seen anyone in a jumper
like shorts and like a jumper.

1357
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,500
And one day Georgia has the exact
same jumper on and I was like,

1358
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,340
Holy Shit.

1359
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:13,840
And she looked fucking just,

1360
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:14,350
I gave me,

1361
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,640
I called Amy and took
a picture of Georgia,

1362
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,513
sent it to her.

1363
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,463
But yeah,

1364
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,260
she reminds me a lot of Amy.

1365
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,300
Yeah.

1366
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,133
Yeah.

1367
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,640
There's a fraternity of comedians.

1368
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,270
Right.

1369
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,870
It's nice.

1370
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,130
I ran into him at the airport.

1371
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:27,870
Girls in there.

1372
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,240
Yeah.

1373
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,410
We ran into each other at the airport.

1374
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:30,430
Standard Point says that.

1375
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,380
So it was fun running into
a community in the airport.

1376
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:32,840
Yeah,

1377
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,520
absolutely.

1378
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,060
Him,

1379
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,601
her,

1380
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:35,350
her,

1381
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:39,070
her feature and her road manager at
a bar at like seven in the morning in

1382
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:39,904
Portland.

1383
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,300
Like I,

1384
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,500
we had partied two nights before,

1385
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:42,730
but then we all were on the same flight,

1386
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:45,070
random at in New York and we
were getting down at the bar.

1387
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,210
I just ran into Marin.

1388
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:46,920
Shut up.

1389
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,131
Yeah.

1390
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:50,850
We were both in Indianapolis at the same
time and we're on the same flight and

1391
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:51,780
he was right behind me.

1392
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,620
That's hilarious.

1393
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:52,951
Fucking,

1394
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:53,380
it's great.

1395
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,030
Yeah,

1396
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,500
it's cool.

1397
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,170
And I wouldn't change seats to
sit next to one on a plane now,

1398
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,990
but it's fun running into
might if it was someone cool,

1399
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,301
you know,

1400
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:02,730
but then I shouldn't have said that.

1401
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,843
You.

1402
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,760
There are certain comedians that I'm
not really into hanging out with and if

1403
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:12,660
they cornered me,

1404
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:13,560
it would kind of suck.

1405
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,670
You know,

1406
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,630
let's just go down the list.

1407
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,800
That's a gospel.

1408
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,600
Uh,

1409
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,433
yeah.

1410
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,313
I know what you're saying.

1411
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,890
I'd never,

1412
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,920
anytime I'm about,

1413
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,050
look,

1414
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:24,160
I'm,

1415
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,550
I'm not sitting next to you and God
didn't mean for us to sit next to each

1416
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:26,731
other.

1417
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:27,564
I don't want to sit next to you.

1418
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,220
You know what is a,

1419
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,480
a little element in society that we too
quickly accepted what the people that

1420
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:39,690
have a stand that they set up in front
of the exit door at the fucking grocery

1421
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:40,524
store.

1422
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,220
Oh,

1423
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,053
cons,

1424
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,190
gay and lesbians,

1425
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,173
whatever it is,

1426
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,961
mine the other day.

1427
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:45,351
And they were like,

1428
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:46,184
take a second for gambling.

1429
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,760
Yes,

1430
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,230
yes.

1431
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,710
The Guy,

1432
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,101
the guy.

1433
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,110
Do you have one minute for gay rights

1434
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,750
finger in my face?

1435
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:52,261
And I went,

1436
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:52,471
no,

1437
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:53,070
I don't like him.

1438
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,461
And he was like,

1439
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:53,971
excuse me.

1440
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:54,111
I go,

1441
00:37:54,111 --> 00:37:54,441
I'm kidding.

1442
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:54,911
I don't have time,

1443
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:55,320
man.

1444
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,681
And he was like,

1445
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:56,040
wait,

1446
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,640
hold on Gip.

1447
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,241
And now you're like,

1448
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,770
commit a hate crime by
just passing them by.

1449
00:37:58,771 --> 00:37:59,604
Yeah.

1450
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,001
Yeah.

1451
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:00,780
It's guilt.

1452
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,440
It's like the guilt stop after you
walking out with your organic vegetables.

1453
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,120
Take two seconds to make
sure we're porn stairs.

1454
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:06,661
Wear condoms.

1455
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:07,301
I'm with my kids.

1456
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:07,920
I'm like,

1457
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,191
I go,

1458
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:09,024
no thanks.

1459
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,990
Did they really say that?

1460
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:11,550
I swear to God outside the target,

1461
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:16,050
the target porn stars wear condoms.

1462
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:16,681
Daddy,

1463
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:17,730
what's a condom?

1464
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,450
I'm with my daughters and my wife and,

1465
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,180
but I sold myself out quick and was like,

1466
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,430
ah,

1467
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,700
no way am I want to say excuse me.

1468
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,391
And I was like,

1469
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:25,230
who wasn't where common.

1470
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:25,820
It was like,

1471
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,251
I don't,

1472
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:27,850
I want them not to have you.

1473
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:27,981
I go,

1474
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:29,280
have you ever seen a point
where they're wearing condoms?

1475
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,150
And she's like,

1476
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,421
no,

1477
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:31,171
I've never seen a porn.

1478
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:31,350
I go,

1479
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,200
it's fucking bomb has never seen it.

1480
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:34,650
Porn.

1481
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,130
My wife has never seen a porn.

1482
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,323
Wow.

1483
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,550
She's potatoes,

1484
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,050
potatoes and she doesn't,

1485
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,930
she doesn't squirt easy with that house.

1486
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,993
Your wife,

1487
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,973
both of

1488
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,230
what?

1489
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,300
A No consensus on what
that squirting stuff is.

1490
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,443
Dana d Imani,

1491
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,450
apparently she's changed her position,

1492
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,770
but she told me it was pissed.

1493
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,341
She saw me.

1494
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:03,190
This girl's a p and each other
and now apparently she does not.

1495
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,240
There's not,

1496
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,910
there's not a gland inside a vagina
that produces a liter of fluid too,

1497
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,300
so it explodes at the end and not real.

1498
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:11,621
No,

1499
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:11,741
no,

1500
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:11,921
no.

1501
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:12,490
It's,

1502
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,480
it's 100% real.

1503
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:18,470
It's not even like a fucking
conspiracy to red band over here.

1504
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,190
100% it's 100% proven
that it's not pissed.

1505
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:24,641
Look,

1506
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:25,360
I've been,

1507
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,150
I've had squirt in my
mouth millions of times.

1508
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,080
I've been,

1509
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,500
I haven't definitely not your mouth.

1510
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,640
It's definitely not pee.

1511
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,110
It's a 100% okay,

1512
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:35,944
here we go.

1513
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,330
I did

1514
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,910
and I got to the myth.

1515
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,500
Here's the myths about squirting.

1516
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:43,950
Okay.

1517
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,280
Ready?

1518
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Myth number one that it's p wow.

1519
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,490
Many experts believe that
what comes out of a woman,

1520
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,920
she's a Jackie waiting his urine,

1521
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,560
but women who squirt
will tell you otherwise.

1522
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,870
Some have given it the smell,

1523
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:59,850
even taste test and insist.

1524
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:00,451
It's not.

1525
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:05,451
P researchers determined that the fluid
admitted during orgasm showed all the

1526
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:08,760
characteristics of prostate plasma.

1527
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,573
What is that?

1528
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,391
Don't Bam.

1529
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:12,440
When you don't even know what that is.

1530
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,283
Brian.

1531
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:14,591
He's like,

1532
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:15,424
yeah,

1533
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,500
told you the pilot was on

1534
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,400
and not urine and concluded.

1535
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:24,860
This might be proof that our para youth,

1536
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,610
real hmm.

1537
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,820
Skins gland,

1538
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,050
where the fluid comes from,

1539
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:32,380
function as female prostate glands.

1540
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:33,214
Wow.

1541
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,230
So apparently the theory is that in,

1542
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,650
in some women,

1543
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:41,500
this one gland can also,

1544
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,070
it functions almost as like in a jacket.

1545
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:44,981
I'll tell you,

1546
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:46,210
I'm willing to accept that.

1547
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:50,080
Not I'm willing to accept that possibly
there is a minority of women just like

1548
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:50,914
Puffy Nipples,

1549
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,500
like puppy nipples or something
that not everyone has.

1550
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,120
But then you see them
and you know what I mean?

1551
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,210
I'm pretty sure I could make any girl
squirt a hundred percent Brian throw up.

1552
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:01,481
Yeah,

1553
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:02,314
for sure.

1554
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,330
Not that kind of squares.

1555
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:03,581
I be like,

1556
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:03,850
listen,

1557
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,110
if this is what it takes
to get them out of the bed,

1558
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:05,944
I'll piss in it.

1559
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,150
But this is what it says.

1560
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:07,870
This mean,

1561
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,870
this website is saying that every
woman is capable of doing it.

1562
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,040
They just have to learn.

1563
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,211
Okay.

1564
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:15,790
So it says there are lots
of experts and female sex.

1565
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,590
They only tell you what
website this is called,

1566
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:18,370
the Frisky,

1567
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:18,851
the frisky.

1568
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,010
Dot Com and it's six
myths about squirting.

1569
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,480
If you want to look forward to yourself,

1570
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,320
if you're like,

1571
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,830
hmm,

1572
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,900
I'd like to know more about

1573
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,873
squirting Joe.

1574
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,661
There's actually a video,

1575
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:29,720
it's also online that will teach you
how to actually make a girl squirt.

1576
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:33,530
Cause there's two like two main ways to
make a girl squirt and obviously the one

1577
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:34,010
is you know

1578
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,500
her g spot and if you just hit her g spot,

1579
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,650
like if you're licking the pussy and you
have a finger on the g spot the whole

1580
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:40,250
time and your effort,

1581
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,840
you can make her squirt that way.

1582
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,740
Or if you just know the right positions
to fuck her at your Dick and hit that g

1583
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:48,200
spot and it's really easy to do and you
could just watch this video and you can

1584
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:50,090
make real squirts and that
it's really easy to do.

1585
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:50,751
Yeah.

1586
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,940
But I saw a girl squirt when
she was getting fucked up or,

1587
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:53,990
but how's that work?

1588
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,680
Because that's a different kind of,

1589
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,580
uh,

1590
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,470
orgasms.

1591
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,110
Christ.

1592
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:58,891
That's not the same.

1593
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,330
That's not g spot where it goes.

1594
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,710
That's actually that orgasm that
she had is actually a deeper,

1595
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:06,030
harder to get orgasms.

1596
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:07,050
So you didn't really see that.

1597
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,490
But a lot of them aren't yet.

1598
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:13,390
But a lot of porn actually fakes
a squirting in Port Elizabeth.

1599
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,670
This is a hardcore,

1600
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,810
I know a lot about squirting man.

1601
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,140
I like [inaudible].

1602
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,760
I know a lot about squirting dude.

1603
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:27,510
I have waterproof sheets now because it
will ruin your warranty on your mattress

1604
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,930
if it starts getting girls farting.

1605
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,800
That's one position.

1606
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,670
Um,

1607
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,590
so this is another one.

1608
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:35,940
It's also saying that it's not,

1609
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,240
that's a myth that it's caused
by the stimulation of the g spot.

1610
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,573
Okay.

1611
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,320
Every woman is not capable of doing it.

1612
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:44,430
I'm sorry when I said that,

1613
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,630
that's actually a myth.

1614
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,060
So it's one of the cases,

1615
00:42:48,061 --> 00:42:49,060
one of the things that they're saying,

1616
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,903
it's a myth.

1617
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,370
Every woman's capable then
never woman's not capable.

1618
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,650
This is saying in the five myths,

1619
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,590
one of them is,

1620
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,490
is not p two is that every
woman is capable of doing it.

1621
00:42:59,491 --> 00:43:00,240
They just have to learn.

1622
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,700
She's saying no or he
or whoever wrote this,

1623
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,860
ask Jeeves has a different opinion.

1624
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:05,551
It's Amy.

1625
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:06,384
A woman they name.

1626
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,313
Oh No,

1627
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:08,603
I made her squirt

1628
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,033
Ami.

1629
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,123
So I guess the dude,

1630
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,691
sorry.

1631
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,550
Ami when named John.

1632
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:14,791
Amy,

1633
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:15,150
Bro.

1634
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:15,983
I'm sorry.

1635
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,370
Um,

1636
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,710
regardless everything you like porn porn.

1637
00:43:19,711 --> 00:43:21,680
I've disconnected the tad
bit from porn because I,

1638
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:22,291
I still watch it,

1639
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:24,480
but it just seems like a lot of the shit,

1640
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,810
the way you've seen a porn just isn't
stuff that happens to this website.

1641
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,560
Just lost me.

1642
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,090
You just said exactly what I was reading,

1643
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:30,924
which is hilarious.

1644
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:31,410
Are you sure?

1645
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,243
Yes,

1646
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,200
exactly why you were saying this.

1647
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:37,050
It's at number six as
far as the mess of porn,

1648
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,210
that what you see in porn is real.

1649
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,770
The porn is unrealistic sexual
expectations and imposes upon us.

1650
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,220
We see a large amount of fluid squirting
out of a woman's vagina in porn.

1651
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,850
Keep in mind this could be faked by
putting water in her vagina before filming

1652
00:43:50,851 --> 00:43:53,370
or having a woman p on camera.

1653
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,750
One Who can have Jackie late will tell
you that it's easiest when you're relaxed

1654
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,840
and having cameras on you is not the
most relaxing when experience pleasure.

1655
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,500
I've talked about my free cams before it.

1656
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:05,440
That's the biggest thing right now the
other girls are doing is they have these

1657
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:10,120
dildos that actually have water in it
pushes the water in you and then they

1658
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:11,980
explode and so every girl's squirting,

1659
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:12,340
right?

1660
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,671
Yeah.

1661
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,080
That's what it looks like.

1662
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,950
So may,

1663
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:15,701
so there you go.

1664
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:19,360
While you were saying that while you
were saying that I was reading it

1665
00:44:19,361 --> 00:44:20,194
serendipity.

1666
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,063
It's crazy man.

1667
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,810
It's like you and I are like
connected to Bernie journey.

1668
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,790
I feel like we already are chemo savvy.

1669
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:30,880
It's like the new ad for the
lone ranger with Johnny Depp.

1670
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,860
That's what I feel like,

1671
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:32,520
dude,

1672
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,480
Johnny Depp is,

1673
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,170
this is,

1674
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,003
this is how this,

1675
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,360
this is how my conversations work.

1676
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:37,980
Okay.

1677
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,820
Johnny Depp is the prototype
for the death squad compound.

1678
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,230
Johnny Depp is,

1679
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,820
Johnny Depp owns a whole street in Los
Angeles and the Hollywood hills and he's

1680
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:49,140
got the whole fucking street.

1681
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:51,480
I'm not going to take anything where
he is where or anything like that,

1682
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,790
but he owns every house.

1683
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,050
He just bought them all except for like
one so that no one can move near island

1684
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:57,893
can move in and he's,

1685
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,820
and it's just as it just
fucking loads it out.

1686
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,773
It's all his boys.

1687
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,420
He was like,

1688
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,460
lots of smart move.

1689
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:03,510
Fuck yes,

1690
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,130
but you know how much real estate is
you gotta have ball or type money sign?

1691
00:45:07,131 --> 00:45:08,220
You got to have more money than me.

1692
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,211
No,

1693
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:10,500
I'm not asking you to buy it.

1694
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,190
I'm saying what we need to do is we need
to start a fucking organization and by

1695
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,860
a street did not want to be down
the street from this motherfucker.

1696
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,600
I'm all about that squad car.

1697
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,900
One of the gals comes home in the
middle of the night and finds this some

1698
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,690
fuckery afoot screen squirting.

1699
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,070
It's five in the morning and he,

1700
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,510
he's stuttering,

1701
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:28,344
arguing and stuff.

1702
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,050
I want to be around a bunch of guys.

1703
00:45:30,051 --> 00:45:30,980
I'm like my privacy,

1704
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:31,560
you know,

1705
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,560
if I want to fucking take somebody home,

1706
00:45:33,561 --> 00:45:35,510
I don't want everyone in
the fucking know about it.

1707
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:36,820
You know how everybody know about it?

1708
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,590
You're like desperate housewives,

1709
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:40,730
but with a bunch of guys.

1710
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,121
Oh No,

1711
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:42,740
I want to own a Johnny Depp my life.

1712
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:43,650
I just want to

1713
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,170
make over there

1714
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,520
Johnny privacy.

1715
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:51,470
All of a sudden you fucked.

1716
00:45:51,471 --> 00:45:52,520
Somebody tells everybody,

1717
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:54,500
hey guys,

1718
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,640
I make every girl squirt.

1719
00:45:55,641 --> 00:45:56,920
I need my privacy guy

1720
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,020
making girls squirt.

1721
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:00,711
It's pretty easy to do.

1722
00:46:00,711 --> 00:46:01,980
And you can learn how to teach yourself.

1723
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,310
I'm saying.

1724
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,040
Yeah,

1725
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,640
that's exactly what I'll do is after
sex I have to get up and changes dated a

1726
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:09,260
few girls with broken vagina sign.

1727
00:46:09,261 --> 00:46:10,250
Congratulations.

1728
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,680
It just pissing all over.

1729
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:14,001
He's silly.

1730
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:14,834
Fuck.

1731
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,080
Um,

1732
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,913
so,

1733
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:17,691
okay.

1734
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,850
How about let's Google
squirting is not real.

1735
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,693
How

1736
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,450
I wrote a Google squirting is fake.

1737
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:24,284
But uh,

1738
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,960
how can you fucking research
a subject while you're on,

1739
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,460
I'm telling you right now,

1740
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:30,850
how could you drank it,

1741
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,390
Joe Merrill's.

1742
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:35,541
Okay.

1743
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:36,081
Gallons.

1744
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:36,710
You'd be dead.

1745
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,540
Can you see possibly how we,

1746
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:38,900
your,

1747
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,310
your opinion might be suspect.

1748
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,153
Brian,

1749
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:44,720
I am telling you this is something
that some women is definitely real.

1750
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,700
I think here's another website.

1751
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,070
Squirting who's for real
and who's faking it.

1752
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,983
Oh No,

1753
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,170
this is websites that are debating
whether or not women are fake and who's

1754
00:46:57,171 --> 00:46:57,681
faking it.

1755
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:00,680
And how to know proof squirting is fake.

1756
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,750
This is silly.

1757
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,211
Well,

1758
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:02,721
you know what?

1759
00:47:02,721 --> 00:47:03,890
I don't think it's fake.

1760
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,210
I think too many people say do
it in too many girls do do it.

1761
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,390
I think that is a lot of
people that do fake it.

1762
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:15,160
But apparently one of the myths is that
every woman can do it and [inaudible]

1763
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,770
not every woman can do it apparently.

1764
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,780
And it depends upon that one gland.

1765
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,801
Some women,

1766
00:47:20,801 --> 00:47:21,550
they have that,

1767
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,050
that gland access.

1768
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,240
It's like gagging like,

1769
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:24,570
like,

1770
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,403
like,

1771
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,970
like a lot of women gag,

1772
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,470
like some women gag during sex,

1773
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,980
but now think a lot of what goes

1774
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,890
on in porn is a lot of over the
top gagging like when Morris,

1775
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,090
and so it's what it is,

1776
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:35,230
is it works one time.

1777
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:36,340
It's just like fucking comedy.

1778
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,031
It worked.

1779
00:47:37,031 --> 00:47:37,690
One time.

1780
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:41,230
Savannah Samson got deep throat
by Rocco's to Friday's and cried,

1781
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:41,821
you know,

1782
00:47:41,821 --> 00:47:42,654
too much.

1783
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,260
Someone Yoshi told me,

1784
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,480
if you want to see where you want to see,

1785
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,370
like what he was inspired,

1786
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,390
what inspires him?

1787
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:49,901
He's like,

1788
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:50,734
watch it.

1789
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:51,071
He goes,

1790
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:51,310
it's tough.

1791
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,143
It's tough to watch.

1792
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,260
Why is it tough to watch?

1793
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,593
Uh,

1794
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,410
she is not a porn star at the time.

1795
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:58,480
She's married and she is her.

1796
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,020
She asked for her anniversary for her
husband to go to France and fuck rockets

1797
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:03,190
or Fridays or Italy,

1798
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:03,520
maybe,

1799
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,150
maybe France,

1800
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,481
no one,

1801
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:05,314
nine barrels.

1802
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,090
So they go to,

1803
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:07,420
um,

1804
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,231
she flies over.

1805
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:08,981
It turned another girl,

1806
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:10,600
but the other girl was clearly like,

1807
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,110
um,

1808
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,640
trail friendly with Rocco's Freddy.

1809
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,421
She's written it before.

1810
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:15,280
She knows what to expect in the curves.

1811
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,930
Savannah's Sampson does not.

1812
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:17,680
I am,

1813
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,860
I'm telling you right now is one of the
most aggressive pieces of porn I've ever

1814
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:25,861
witnessed it is it she's crying within
like the first five minutes and it's a 45

1815
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:27,400
minute fuck.

1816
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,200
It's like,

1817
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,820
like she is,

1818
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,653
is that her?

1819
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:30,460
Huh?

1820
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,090
What is that?

1821
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:31,541
It's you,

1822
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,290
you fuck.

1823
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:32,690
Oh No.

1824
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,230
What did you say?

1825
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,063
Whoa.

1826
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,410
Whoa.

1827
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:35,581
No,

1828
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:36,640
there Brian's pulling something up.

1829
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:37,301
No,

1830
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:38,440
he didn't get anything.

1831
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:38,831
So,

1832
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:39,210
uh,

1833
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:39,520
is it,

1834
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,750
I feel like now I feel like we're getting,

1835
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,430
getting pranked.

1836
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:42,310
So I'm so,

1837
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:42,481
no,

1838
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:44,080
but within the first five minutes,

1839
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:44,914
she is like,

1840
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:49,090
like she can't breathe and she sits in
the thing and it is the realist fucking

1841
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:49,421
reaction.

1842
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:49,601
He goes,

1843
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:50,231
did you like that?

1844
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:50,861
Did you like that?

1845
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,060
Did you like be all you can be on this?

1846
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,580
Maybe you can be on this baby if
you did not like you can tell me.

1847
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,380
And she's wiping tears
away from where I was sick.

1848
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,700
I didn't really like that.

1849
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,300
And he goes,

1850
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:58,451
oh,

1851
00:48:58,451 --> 00:48:59,950
then we just need to
find another position.

1852
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:01,930
Laser on her back and
starts throwing fucking her.

1853
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:02,321
And she's like,

1854
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:03,880
you can just see her body going.

1855
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,510
And then this is an acting.

1856
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:08,900
It's Yoshi man.

1857
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,720
Yoshi is a,

1858
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,240
at the,

1859
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,073
it is,

1860
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,120
this is how Savannah
Sampson got her start.

1861
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:18,121
Is that the anal sex scene is so
fucking real that you literally,

1862
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,690
did she ever tell him to stop?

1863
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,080
Uh,

1864
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:20,441
no,

1865
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:22,450
because this was her anniversary gift.

1866
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,010
She wanted this.

1867
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:24,671
Okay.

1868
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:25,690
So she enjoyed it.

1869
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:26,920
Uh,

1870
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,090
that's debatable.

1871
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,490
She did come back the next
night and do it again,

1872
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:32,470
but I don't know if she enjoyed it.

1873
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:33,580
The fuck are you even saying?

1874
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,443
I don't know if she,

1875
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:37,510
if you got to watch it and go crazy
and that's why she did it twice.

1876
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,010
I met her,

1877
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:38,980
she's pretty,

1878
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:39,400
uh,

1879
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,233
pretty out there,

1880
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:41,740
but,

1881
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,220
but she became a porn store right after
this because it was such a popular video

1882
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,031
that she,

1883
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:47,590
like all of a sudden she was married,

1884
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,341
she was married,

1885
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:51,940
she was a stripper scores and she
said her husband for my anniversary,

1886
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,160
I want to go over and
fuck Rocco's Freddy's wow.

1887
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,011
And she did.

1888
00:49:55,011 --> 00:49:55,900
And the husband said,

1889
00:49:55,901 --> 00:49:56,680
I'm cool with that.

1890
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:56,951
Yeah.

1891
00:49:56,951 --> 00:49:57,491
Husband's like,

1892
00:49:57,491 --> 00:49:57,731
I'm cool.

1893
00:49:57,731 --> 00:49:58,570
I think there's still married.

1894
00:49:58,571 --> 00:49:59,650
I want to say they're still married.

1895
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,410
I am guessing defense jokes.

1896
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:04,010
But yeah.

1897
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:04,930
Have you watched the video?

1898
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:06,130
I just googled it and it's like,

1899
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:06,560
it's,

1900
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,370
it's,

1901
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,540
it's the first bit of Gonzo porn now.

1902
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,650
Gonzo porn is like,

1903
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,750
I'm talking like I'm an expert.

1904
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,080
Important.

1905
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,450
I just,

1906
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,530
I've watched you and him together get
together and start your own fucking school

1907
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,030
and how to teach people about
what really goes on in bedrooms.

1908
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,220
But yeah,

1909
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,780
I that now I see now I now I watched that.

1910
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:28,850
I was telling Brian it's hard to watch
follow some girls on vine because you've

1911
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:31,220
seen them in porn and then
you see them on vine as a,

1912
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,360
as like a regular person.

1913
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:32,421
Yeah.

1914
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:33,290
What's that girl's name again?

1915
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:37,580
Like it then it's like
the whole time I'm like,

1916
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,530
it's almost like seeing a,

1917
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:44,300
it's like seeing someone undercover cause
it's like this girl that you've seen

1918
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:48,800
just too fucking crazy shit that she's
at the Kentucky Derby just hanging out

1919
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:50,240
with regular people and they're
all hanging out with her.

1920
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:50,701
And pardon me,

1921
00:50:50,701 --> 00:50:51,290
it was like,

1922
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:51,771
oh my God.

1923
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:54,880
Like it really is kind of
voyeuristic going like sexism.

1924
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,760
It's a weird thing.

1925
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,440
It's like everybody wants to do it
but nobody wants you to see him do it.

1926
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,770
We have like weird things like that.

1927
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:04,880
Especially like women,

1928
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:07,820
like a woman who's willing
to let the whole world here.

1929
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,270
Fuck.

1930
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,040
That's like,

1931
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,020
that's a really gangster move for girl.

1932
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,500
I,

1933
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,030
it's,

1934
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:17,120
it's amazing how many guys would do
it if you didn't show their face.

1935
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,360
Every guy.

1936
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:18,530
Yeah,

1937
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:18,950
maybe.

1938
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,321
But I mean,

1939
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:19,801
it's just the,

1940
00:51:19,801 --> 00:51:21,200
it's the whole thing is weird.

1941
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:24,140
It's weird that people want to see you.

1942
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:26,270
It's weird that you want to see them.

1943
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,710
It's weird that,

1944
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,191
you know,

1945
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:29,930
we hide our nakedness from each other.

1946
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,291
I mean,

1947
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:32,690
just close themselves are so odd.

1948
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,460
The,

1949
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:38,460
the body is like literally accepting a
constant symbiotic relationship to its

1950
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,370
own creations.

1951
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,560
A constant relationship with clothing,

1952
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,850
with shoes,

1953
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:44,870
with pants,

1954
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:45,261
with your,

1955
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:47,750
you're constantly draped in close.

1956
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:48,790
Even when you're on the,

1957
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:49,550
in a beach,

1958
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:49,851
you,

1959
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:52,280
your clothes are represented there.

1960
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,280
Skimpy little thing that just
covers the minimal areas.

1961
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,780
But when you know,

1962
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,120
you get naked and he gets sexual,

1963
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:02,090
it's like that's the only
time when you're completely,

1964
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,571
you know,

1965
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:04,820
rid of these clothes and
that's just temporary.

1966
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,890
And do that for a little bit
and get your clothes back on.

1967
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,250
Yeah.

1968
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,500
It's like we have this weird
relationship with clothes,

1969
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,190
man.

1970
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:14,990
It's like we've just accepted that these
fucking things that we make are a part

1971
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:17,840
of our everyday life with
no question whatsoever.

1972
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,340
And that to have that,

1973
00:52:19,341 --> 00:52:21,470
that not be the case is bad.

1974
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,180
And then when,

1975
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,090
and then like my daughter's going
through tactile issues with clothing.

1976
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,980
Like she doesn't like wearing,

1977
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,970
she doesn't like wearing like,

1978
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:28,670
uh,

1979
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,680
she asked for a knee high socks,

1980
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:29,861
shit.

1981
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:30,880
Watch to wear cowboy boots.

1982
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,350
Like some clothes feel comfortable.

1983
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:33,041
I have the same problem.

1984
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:35,680
I don't wear underwear because it's

1985
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:39,471
never,

1986
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:39,870
I've never,

1987
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:40,111
I've,

1988
00:52:40,111 --> 00:52:42,410
I haven't wore underwear in a long time
because it drives me fucking cotton.

1989
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:42,820
A zipper.

1990
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,060
So you never have accidents and being
somebody that drinks a lot of course.

1991
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:46,900
Well first of all,

1992
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,311
drinking lot.

1993
00:52:47,311 --> 00:52:47,851
It doesn't mean shit.

1994
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:49,960
Your pants a lot by a lot.

1995
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,720
Yeah.

1996
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,570
Well I mean once a month and so,

1997
00:52:52,571 --> 00:52:52,790
no,

1998
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,220
I've definitely shit my pants,

1999
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:54,880
but I've,

2000
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,331
don't worry,

2001
00:52:55,331 --> 00:52:55,921
I'm fine there.

2002
00:52:55,921 --> 00:53:00,100
Brody 30 says he at least sits
itself like once every two weeks.

2003
00:53:00,101 --> 00:53:01,170
There's one he probably does.

2004
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:01,660
I just,

2005
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,493
cause he had the board.

2006
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:03,360
No,

2007
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,330
but I'm still to go back to your point
is that once someone does have issues

2008
00:53:07,331 --> 00:53:08,050
with closing,

2009
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,550
they're broken and you've got,

2010
00:53:09,551 --> 00:53:09,761
you go,

2011
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:09,911
oh,

2012
00:53:09,911 --> 00:53:10,601
we gotta fix that.

2013
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:10,901
And you're like,

2014
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:11,041
well,

2015
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:11,441
it's weird.

2016
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:15,340
Why is what you're saying
is it's not natural to us.

2017
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,480
Like you look at a three piece suit,

2018
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,310
how fucking ridiculous to say I was,

2019
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,260
I went to see the great Gatsby last night.

2020
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:21,050
It suck.

2021
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:21,860
No,

2022
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,270
it did not suck man.

2023
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,040
People keep saying that it
sucked because they made some

2024
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,890
really odd choices and one
of the really odd choices,

2025
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:33,891
where did they use a lot of modern music
like Jay z music and there's rap music

2026
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:35,874
in there,

2027
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,910
but it's a period piece about the 1920s.

2028
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:40,260
Like why would you have,

2029
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:43,440
why would you have Jay z plan
and why would you have a hip hop?

2030
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:46,110
Why would you have like
popular music like a,

2031
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,801
what's that girl's name?

2032
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:47,640
Alana Ray,

2033
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,490
I think she's saying it sounds like her.

2034
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,653
And it was,

2035
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,030
it's too obviously,

2036
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,450
uh,

2037
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,050
modern and I thought it was really
fascinating that they did it that way.

2038
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,570
I don't necessarily know if
it was the best way to do it,

2039
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,320
but it gave an unmistakable
energy that worked,

2040
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:04,771
you know,

2041
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:05,730
it was really good.

2042
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,300
So like people complaining that they
were using this rap and it just,

2043
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:10,710
I see what you're saying,

2044
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:11,660
but if you just said,

2045
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,380
can accept it as a work of art,

2046
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,140
it's like a visual masterpiece.

2047
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,870
I saw it in three D it's an amazing movie.

2048
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:19,681
The way they shot it.

2049
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:21,690
It's one of the most beautiful
movies I've ever seen in my life.

2050
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,610
Did you bring your own glass?

2051
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:23,180
Ratable?

2052
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:23,381
No,

2053
00:54:23,381 --> 00:54:23,431
no,

2054
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:23,551
no.

2055
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,300
You get them there,

2056
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:24,520
but,

2057
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,231
but they're not real.

2058
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:25,560
They're,

2059
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,700
they're not the paper ones.

2060
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:27,090
Right.

2061
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:27,923
They're plastic.

2062
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,043
You recycle.

2063
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,610
Yeah.

2064
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:30,060
I've never been,

2065
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:30,893
I've never been to it.

2066
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,040
Three d movies bother me.

2067
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,311
Oh,

2068
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,230
the new Three d man is amazing.

2069
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,990
I've never yet they
have now God damn this.

2070
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,470
Um,

2071
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,010
if you,

2072
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,120
if you go to see,

2073
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:39,510
uh,

2074
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,440
the great Gatsby need,

2075
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:44,340
don't see the three d you're going to
miss on half the movie because it's just

2076
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:45,550
the effect that it created.

2077
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:45,811
I mean,

2078
00:54:45,811 --> 00:54:47,040
it's visually,

2079
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:47,940
it's stunning.

2080
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,500
It really is like a work of art.

2081
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,030
Like you bet it is beautiful.

2082
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,990
It's so beautiful.

2083
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:53,760
It's just the way it's shot is beautiful.

2084
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,200
The way it's edited as beautiful.

2085
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:56,220
It's an amazing movie,

2086
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:56,730
man.

2087
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:00,600
I mean I saw the great gay or read
the Great Gatsby in high school.

2088
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:00,951
I saw,

2089
00:55:00,951 --> 00:55:05,160
I really barely remember the plot and I
was sort of picking things up as I went

2090
00:55:05,161 --> 00:55:05,700
along.

2091
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,380
So going into it with that,

2092
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:08,250
um,

2093
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:13,250
I really enjoyed it but I know people
that have read it recently and they didn't

2094
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:17,850
enjoy it as much because they felt
like it deviated too much from,

2095
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,150
uh,

2096
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:18,983
from the book.

2097
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,450
But I can't say that because again,

2098
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,770
I'm not going to read it again.

2099
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,910
And it was a long ass time ago but
it was a really enjoyable movie

2100
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,103
was really good.

2101
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:29,430
It's fucking interesting.

2102
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,410
It's hard to do those
period pieces with music.

2103
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:31,820
There was a,

2104
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,430
there was a movie that was made
by outkast called Idlewild,

2105
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,630
the band outcast.

2106
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:37,240
Yeah.

2107
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:37,830
Pop.

2108
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,920
And they did all their own music
and it was set in like the 30s,

2109
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,440
but it was cool as shit
because they did all the music.

2110
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,700
Yeah that's bad ass.

2111
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:45,630
Like they should have hired,

2112
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:49,680
I think they should have hired some band
to do all the music and just make it

2113
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:50,190
real.

2114
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:50,570
Right,

2115
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:50,910
right.

2116
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,860
Cause that Glenn Miller was a bad ass.

2117
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:56,400
Fucking Glenn Miller was the
prototype for Badass rock stars.

2118
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:58,350
He was the m and m but in World War II.

2119
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,250
You anything Buckland Miller.

2120
00:55:59,340 --> 00:55:59,810
Yeah,

2121
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,320
he went into the army,

2122
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,100
any of that song,

2123
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:02,933
bum,

2124
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:04,500
Bom,

2125
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:04,960
Bom,

2126
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,670
Bom,

2127
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:06,400
Bom,

2128
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:06,910
Bom,

2129
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:07,720
bom and Amanda

2130
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,610
like it was bad and he went over and flew
fucking planes and then died in world

2131
00:56:12,611 --> 00:56:14,050
war one.

2132
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:14,651
I think it was Warren.

2133
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:15,484
Yeah.

2134
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,390
Or maybe it was too.

2135
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,753
I don't know.

2136
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,250
Um,

2137
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:18,820
I might be,

2138
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,030
I may not even be Glenn Miller.

2139
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,120
Fuck you got a story in
my head and I'm like,

2140
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:28,840
oh no idea.

2141
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,290
I want to,

2142
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,550
that is accurate.

2143
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,021
Well,

2144
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:31,230
I,

2145
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:31,640
I,

2146
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:36,090
I see that you would want to have mood
music in a movie about a period of the

2147
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:37,140
music from that period.

2148
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,820
Like get it girl talk to do it,

2149
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,310
but this child and this
chance that they took,

2150
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,031
I'm telling you,

2151
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:42,481
it worked.

2152
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:43,620
It worked for me at least.

2153
00:56:43,621 --> 00:56:45,030
I thought it was an amazing movie.

2154
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:49,140
But I was amazed also when
I went on rotten tomatoes
when I saw it only got like

2155
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:50,040
43%.

2156
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,181
How does that work?

2157
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:53,640
I never understand how wrong the world is.

2158
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:56,010
Overrun with comments.

2159
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,893
That's what I say.

2160
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:02,240
I think the current infestation that we
have is that an unprecedented high level

2161
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:06,240
and I think clients are much
more likely to be mouthy.

2162
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,610
They're much more likely
to be active then.

2163
00:57:08,611 --> 00:57:12,660
Then the people that are
honestly reviewing things
from a point of view where

2164
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:13,021
you know,

2165
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:15,390
you could relate to
them or where you could,

2166
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:15,990
uh,

2167
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,231
you know,

2168
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:17,940
you could get something
out of the reviews.

2169
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:18,931
It's a lot of people.

2170
00:57:18,931 --> 00:57:20,670
You're not getting shit out of the review.

2171
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,920
You're getting their shitbag personality.

2172
00:57:22,921 --> 00:57:24,990
Like you ever go on Yelp
and you see five star,

2173
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,441
five star,

2174
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:26,011
five star,

2175
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:26,970
one star,

2176
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:32,210
read that one star read and then go to
their page and read what a miserable cunt

2177
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:34,470
bag human being that is.

2178
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,000
Nine Times out of 10,

2179
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:38,030
it's just someone just spewing,

2180
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:38,291
um,

2181
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:38,401
the,

2182
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:38,670
I,

2183
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:40,110
I gave someone a negative review.

2184
00:57:40,111 --> 00:57:41,730
I joined Yelp to give a negative view.

2185
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,420
That's arrogant.

2186
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,380
How dare you,

2187
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,220
how dare they,

2188
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,053
what did they do?

2189
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:45,893
I will go in,

2190
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:47,430
what is this business?

2191
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:48,480
It's a restaurant,

2192
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,260
a restaurant.

2193
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,093
I go in,

2194
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,120
I'm excited about the food.

2195
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:53,100
I go in and I get attitude,

2196
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,150
like I want to sit by myself.

2197
00:57:54,151 --> 00:57:54,330
It's,

2198
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:55,163
it's 11.

2199
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:56,280
There's no one in there,

2200
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:56,470
right?

2201
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:57,061
Like 1130,

2202
00:57:57,061 --> 00:57:57,894
no one's in there.

2203
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:58,471
And I go,

2204
00:57:58,471 --> 00:57:58,591
yeah,

2205
00:57:58,591 --> 00:57:58,771
okay.

2206
00:57:58,771 --> 00:57:59,730
She can take a one for one.

2207
00:57:59,731 --> 00:58:00,001
And she,

2208
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:00,520
the girl,

2209
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:00,960
the front goes,

2210
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,121
well,

2211
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:02,130
did you just want to sit at the bar?

2212
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,330
And I'm like,

2213
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,220
not know or I wouldn't have
asked for a table for one,

2214
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:06,054
but I'm like,

2215
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,440
well yeah,

2216
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:08,281
I'll go to the bar.

2217
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:08,881
So I go to the parks.

2218
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:09,690
I don't want to be a dick.

2219
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:10,500
I got a beer.

2220
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,250
Really cute.

2221
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,360
Wait a bartender.

2222
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:13,840
Really Nice guy or girl.

2223
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:14,310
Girl.

2224
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:15,143
Girl,

2225
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:16,140
Girl.

2226
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,200
And so they have this cute

2227
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:18,911
for boys,

2228
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:19,361
you know that,

2229
00:58:19,361 --> 00:58:19,870
right?

2230
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:20,230
No,

2231
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,340
you're growled damn man.

2232
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:22,480
With a heavy manly beer.

2233
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:23,150
Don't call it girl.

2234
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:23,550
Cute

2235
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,380
little hottie.

2236
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,220
So she,

2237
00:58:25,221 --> 00:58:25,940
uh,

2238
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,773
she,

2239
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,171
I said,

2240
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:27,650
how does this,

2241
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:28,940
it was a Turkey,

2242
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:29,870
um,

2243
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:34,870
Turkey hot Turkey barbecued southern
style mustard barbecue sauce on it.

2244
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:37,940
I love mustard barbecue sauce.

2245
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:38,900
I fucking love,

2246
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,130
like when you get the three,

2247
00:58:40,131 --> 00:58:41,050
the two of choice,

2248
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,280
four hours go for monster.

2249
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,040
Okay.

2250
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,410
So I go,

2251
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,510
this'll be fucking great.

2252
00:58:44,511 --> 00:58:46,340
So it comes out and it looked good.

2253
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:48,630
The Turkey's not [inaudible].

2254
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,390
It looks like it might've
been coming in a package,

2255
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,253
but it's hot.

2256
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,130
And then I go and there's
not that much to the sauce.

2257
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:54,381
So I go,

2258
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:55,071
can I get more sauce?

2259
00:58:55,071 --> 00:58:55,311
And they go,

2260
00:58:55,311 --> 00:58:55,670
yeah.

2261
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,570
So I put the sauce on.

2262
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,141
It's just mustered.

2263
00:58:58,141 --> 00:58:59,150
They've indoctrinated at all.

2264
00:58:59,450 --> 00:58:59,840
So I go,

2265
00:58:59,840 --> 00:58:59,961
Oh,

2266
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:00,800
this is just mustering.

2267
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:01,131
She goes,

2268
00:59:01,131 --> 00:59:02,000
and the girl says,

2269
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:02,570
yeah,

2270
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,580
it looked kind of fucking
odd when it came out.

2271
00:59:04,581 --> 00:59:06,200
That doesn't look like
what it should look like.

2272
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,071
And I go,

2273
00:59:07,071 --> 00:59:07,660
oh,

2274
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,493
and she goes,

2275
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:08,860
I,

2276
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,860
I'd like to take it off your bill,

2277
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:10,730
but the GM is in here.

2278
00:59:10,731 --> 00:59:10,881
I go,

2279
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:10,971
well,

2280
00:59:10,971 --> 00:59:12,710
let me talk to the cook the chef,

2281
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,110
and I'll tell him that
it isn't what it was.

2282
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:17,000
Stupid fucking cunt came out,

2283
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,650
arms like this on the bar.

2284
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,430
Yeah.

2285
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,210
What?

2286
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,043
And I go,

2287
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,550
is this the mustard?

2288
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:22,851
And he goes,

2289
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:23,120
yeah,

2290
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:23,391
yeah.

2291
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:23,601
I go,

2292
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:25,370
how do you guys make your
mustard barbecue sauce?

2293
00:59:25,371 --> 00:59:25,940
And he goes,

2294
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,421
vinegar,

2295
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:26,781
honey.

2296
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:27,650
Like mustard.

2297
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:28,640
Yeah,

2298
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,600
like real dicky.

2299
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:29,901
And I go,

2300
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:30,051
well,

2301
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:30,321
just,

2302
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:31,040
just wasn't,

2303
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,610
it wasn't what I thought
it was going to be.

2304
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:32,990
He goes,

2305
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,670
maybe we should just change
the name on the menu and then,

2306
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:35,000
Huh?

2307
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,610
And I was like a gas and then he was like,

2308
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:37,761
yeah,

2309
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:39,260
well sorry.

2310
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,191
And walked away.

2311
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:41,024
And I went,

2312
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:41,540
okay,

2313
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,290
I'm joining Yelp,

2314
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:42,810
I'm joining the,

2315
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:45,200
but I'm telling you everyone of
fuck this place is the place.

2316
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,070
Uh,

2317
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:46,251
uh,

2318
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:47,240
I don't want to say it now because

2319
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,283
everyone knows it.

2320
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:48,891
Yup.

2321
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:50,420
And your name's Bert Kreischer on Yelp.

2322
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:50,720
Dick,

2323
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,553
what are you working on?

2324
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,533
Just getting to know.

2325
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,201
Let me tell you what,

2326
00:59:53,201 --> 00:59:54,034
let me tell you what happened.

2327
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,430
Let me tell you what happened afterwards.

2328
00:59:55,431 --> 00:59:56,181
This is obviously,

2329
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:58,670
this is also the fucking
shitty thing about Yelp.

2330
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,510
Okay.

2331
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,130
So I posted,

2332
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:00,771
posted on Yelp.

2333
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:02,780
Yelp goes automatically
to your Twitter and it,

2334
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,540
and it gets tweeted and then all
of a sudden these people see it.

2335
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,270
Now I have 84,000 followers on Twitter.

2336
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,104
So everyone's like,

2337
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,341
start saying like,

2338
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:10,911
what happened?

2339
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:11,690
What was it?

2340
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:14,150
And these people have 350 and they
start seeing it and they're like,

2341
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:14,720
oh shit.

2342
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,310
So then they start coming at me like,

2343
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:16,850
hey,

2344
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,910
like it's the way Yelp works is they
find out if you give him a bad review and

2345
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:22,370
then they want you to take it off because
that really does affect our business.

2346
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,860
So it became a pain in the fucking ass.

2347
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:27,480
And then I felt like a cyber bully
for saying I didn't like a meal.

2348
01:00:27,481 --> 01:00:29,300
I should have just kept my
mouth shut and walked away.

2349
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,550
But it was like they were such
assholes and they were like,

2350
01:00:31,551 --> 01:00:32,061
come back in.

2351
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:32,361
And I was like,

2352
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:33,920
there's no way I'm coming back in.

2353
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:34,941
It was in Baltimore.

2354
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:35,420
It was named,

2355
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:35,880
uh,

2356
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,750
you didn't delete frank,

2357
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,030
frank and nic's.

2358
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,230
You deleted your review.

2359
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,101
No I didn't.

2360
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:40,850
I left it up.

2361
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:41,470
Fuck that guy.

2362
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,303
Yeah,

2363
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,290
I think it's called frank
and nic's frank and next.

2364
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:45,830
And where was it?

2365
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,750
It was in Baltimore right
next to Camden yards.

2366
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:48,740
It was right next to the stadium.

2367
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:49,011
And I,

2368
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:51,290
and I was excited cause everyone was like,

2369
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,700
well you should really
give it a second chance.

2370
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:53,031
And I was like,

2371
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:53,391
I would,

2372
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:54,440
but I wrote about bad review.

2373
01:00:54,441 --> 01:00:55,040
I'm going to know that.

2374
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,280
And I know that the chef was chefs
a big word for what this dude was.

2375
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,960
The Cook was a fucking Dick and I would
not put it past him to make sure I did

2376
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:04,190
not enjoy it again.

2377
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,121
I'm not gonna let it,

2378
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:05,750
I'm not gonna let a dude,

2379
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,321
I don't like that.

2380
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:07,370
I made it vocal.

2381
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:09,020
Make something that I'm
going to put my mouth.

2382
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,520
That's a very good move.

2383
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:11,750
So I didn't go,

2384
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:11,931
but,

2385
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:12,830
and then I felt bad,

2386
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,790
but then everyone was like,

2387
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,960
I went and did radio and they were like,

2388
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:16,311
next morning they're like,

2389
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:17,660
what's your problem with frank and nic's?

2390
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:18,100
And I was like,

2391
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:18,700
Oh,

2392
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,241
you know what?

2393
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:22,600
They need to hear that too because
someone needs to not do that.

2394
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:23,890
Someone needs to,

2395
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:24,181
if you're,

2396
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,740
you're going to be a chef and a
guy has a question about the food,

2397
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,290
not come out and be a fucking
cock sucker like that.

2398
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:30,131
And when you do,

2399
01:01:30,131 --> 01:01:31,090
there's repercussions.

2400
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:31,960
He had to say,

2401
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,280
I mean it's,

2402
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,580
it's not like it's
money out of his pocket.

2403
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,340
He's probably been doing that
to people his whole life,

2404
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:40,840
acting douchey because it puts people on
their heels and it makes people easier

2405
01:01:40,841 --> 01:01:42,550
to deal with in his feeble little mind.

2406
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,090
Yeah.

2407
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,230
All you had to do was say,

2408
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:44,741
well,

2409
01:01:44,741 --> 01:01:45,574
let me get you something else.

2410
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:46,510
Yeah.

2411
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,343
I mean like,

2412
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,350
you know,

2413
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:48,821
I,

2414
01:01:48,821 --> 01:01:49,301
but I,

2415
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:49,960
so I was,

2416
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,690
I was welcoming all this negative
energy and I just fucking stopped.

2417
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:52,931
I was like,

2418
01:01:52,931 --> 01:01:53,764
I'm gonna stop.

2419
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:54,603
And so I'm now at,

2420
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:57,160
and then I'm not going to Yelp and
fucking thing unless I like it.

2421
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:57,330
Oh,

2422
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:57,470
y'all.

2423
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,211
Things like,

2424
01:01:58,211 --> 01:01:58,751
if I don't like it,

2425
01:01:58,751 --> 01:01:59,980
I'm not gonna put it up
there to warn people.

2426
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:00,300
Well,

2427
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:00,890
there's not,

2428
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,080
there's nothing wrong with
telling a true good story,

2429
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:03,950
you know?

2430
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:07,100
But what's wrong is the people that
you look at their thing and they're not

2431
01:02:07,101 --> 01:02:07,934
happy about it.

2432
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:08,980
The world.

2433
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:09,101
Well,

2434
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:09,190
it's,

2435
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:09,701
it's people,

2436
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:10,870
like there was a woman.

2437
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,670
So my wife and I are in large bond.

2438
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:13,240
Uh,

2439
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,910
she's getting her hair done and I'm
just walking around Larchmont to burn

2440
01:02:15,911 --> 01:02:16,660
calories.

2441
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,740
We go into this restaurant,

2442
01:02:17,741 --> 01:02:18,940
this little Mexican place.

2443
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,160
I won't say mom and pop

2444
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,150
because that's what it looked like.

2445
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,040
Then there was like,

2446
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,100
like the cousin was working,

2447
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:24,990
the front dad was making tortillas,

2448
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,270
moms in the back and this
woman comes in and goes,

2449
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,250
are you are with the large
amount of business says Asian.

2450
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,520
It's like 11 o'clock just be my
wife and the kids like I dunno man.

2451
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:33,690
And she's like,

2452
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,270
well cause I don't frequent places
that aren't with the Larchmont business

2453
01:02:36,271 --> 01:02:38,430
association because we pay to clean.

2454
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,080
Like she came in and this conti attitude,

2455
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,600
I was so offended that I was like,

2456
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,590
how dare you walk in with
all this negative energy
and then dump it on people.

2457
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:50,520
And then what happened was she actually
was like smiling at the end cause we

2458
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:53,550
welcomed all her negative shit and
then she left in like a good mood.

2459
01:02:53,551 --> 01:02:56,130
We're all fucking cunty now
because she put it on us.

2460
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:56,401
Yeah.

2461
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:58,320
But that's just because
she's an unaware Douche.

2462
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,950
How could you cause that kind of term
loan and leave feeling like you're in a

2463
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:02,784
good mood.

2464
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:03,943
Yeah.

2465
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,013
But it's

2466
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,500
porn to let people know that that's gross.

2467
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,100
They don't even,

2468
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,830
a lot of times those people don't
even realize how gross they're band.

2469
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:11,750
Yeah.

2470
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,120
It's like when you tell this cook and
he's obviously going to feel terrible

2471
01:03:15,121 --> 01:03:15,954
about this,

2472
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,280
that shit's good for him.

2473
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:18,870
He shouldn't be doing that.

2474
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,291
You know?

2475
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:20,070
That's his best,

2476
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:24,270
very sensitive relationship that a person
who cooks food has to the person that

2477
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:25,110
is eating that food.

2478
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:27,120
And I'm always super nice to cooks,

2479
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,920
always super nice to chefs,

2480
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,980
but if I'm ran into a guy like that,

2481
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,180
I would have the same reaction.

2482
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,991
I bet that you did.

2483
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:35,370
And when you have that reaction,

2484
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:39,090
he needs to know that he's facing that
reaction because this is a direct result

2485
01:03:39,091 --> 01:03:42,090
of his behavior and that should
help him evolve as a person.

2486
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:42,481
It was,

2487
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:47,040
there's only one of those in the city
that one place has like 350 followers on

2488
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:47,281
Twitter.

2489
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:47,731
And Trust me,

2490
01:03:47,731 --> 01:03:50,550
when I say word got back like I call,

2491
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,630
sure it's going to give
back even worse now.

2492
01:03:52,631 --> 01:03:53,940
I'm never fucking going back there.

2493
01:03:53,941 --> 01:03:54,720
I'm on now.

2494
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,630
I'm fucking the guys,

2495
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:55,891
you know?

2496
01:03:55,891 --> 01:03:56,430
Look man,

2497
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,290
it's good for him though.

2498
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:57,771
It's like I've,

2499
01:03:57,771 --> 01:04:01,740
I've definitely been in situations where
I handled hecklers incorrectly and I,

2500
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:04,620
I learned a lesson and I know
now know how to deal with it,

2501
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,251
you know,

2502
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:06,540
but at the same time,

2503
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:06,840
yeah,

2504
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:07,350
it's um,

2505
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,300
it's still a learning curve
and when I do fuck up,

2506
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:09,690
I,

2507
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:09,931
you know,

2508
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:11,430
it's like I know it though.

2509
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,190
I think comedy is one of those things
where it's like dealing with the same

2510
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:14,900
situation.

2511
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,070
Yeah.

2512
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,610
You're talking about someone heckling you.

2513
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,450
Hecklers or hackers are fucking assholes.

2514
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:19,171
Heckler,

2515
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:21,180
you had a question about
the food because it was,

2516
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,410
it was supposed to be a mustard
sauce and it was just muster.

2517
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,181
It's just mustard.

2518
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:27,030
It was young discussing that is
just having mustard on the Turkey.

2519
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,010
I like Turkey with mustard,

2520
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:30,360
but like I need mandates to,

2521
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:30,931
okay.

2522
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:31,764
That's all you,

2523
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,660
I understand you just
do Turkey and mustard.

2524
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:34,051
I just,

2525
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:34,810
I usually just it

2526
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:35,643
Turkey.

2527
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,320
I like hot sauce better
than mustard because I know,

2528
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:38,561
well,

2529
01:04:38,561 --> 01:04:39,880
mustard is not bad for you.

2530
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:40,421
Um,

2531
01:04:40,421 --> 01:04:40,750
not,

2532
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,070
not really high caloric.

2533
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:42,730
Um,

2534
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:43,450
but um,

2535
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,530
but mayonnaise is,

2536
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,600
man is not so great for.

2537
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:46,493
What about Serratia?

2538
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:47,531
That sounds great.

2539
01:04:47,531 --> 01:04:47,770
For it.

2540
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:48,390
Fucking,

2541
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:48,601
yeah.

2542
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:48,751
I mean,

2543
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:52,690
if you just want to add some flavor to
something like a mayonnaise tastes so

2544
01:04:52,691 --> 01:04:53,260
good.

2545
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,093
God Damn.

2546
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,870
You know what's the best that I've been?

2547
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:56,750
I forgot.

2548
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:57,583
Forgot how good it was.

2549
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:01,060
A fried egg sandwich with
mayonnaise and hot sauce.

2550
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:01,943
Fuck.

2551
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,870
Oh,

2552
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:06,420
fried egg sandwich with some fucking
melted cheddar cheese and mayonnaise and

2553
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:08,100
hot sauce and it's not expensive.

2554
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,480
It's an expensive meal.

2555
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:10,860
It's a really reasonable meal.

2556
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,060
I'll take that with mustard.

2557
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:13,710
Just mustard and a egg sandwich.

2558
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:14,544
Fuck yeah.

2559
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,140
Fuck yeah.

2560
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:16,321
Oh,

2561
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:17,154
that's good too.

2562
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,860
Yeah,

2563
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:18,040
the

2564
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,060
grey poupon Shit.

2565
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,200
Nice with it as well.

2566
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,220
I don't mind.

2567
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,980
I don't mind like a lettuce and
tomato on that egg sandwich too.

2568
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,060
I don't mind that either.

2569
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:25,990
A little fiber,

2570
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:28,780
little crunchiness to it and we'll
snap fucking hungry by the way.

2571
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,280
Squirt per dotcoms life,

2572
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:30,560
Joe.

2573
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,660
It's a lot of square for a second.

2574
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:34,220
This whole fucking time I get out,

2575
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,063
Jo,

2576
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,250
I can't show it up close.

2577
01:05:37,251 --> 01:05:40,100
I have to shut this
version of you just play.

2578
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,033
It doesn't do anything.

2579
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,313
Oh Jeez.

2580
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,220
Oh No.

2581
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,240
You've been doing this whole fucking
do something that girls pissing on that

2582
01:05:58,611 --> 01:05:59,444
dude.

2583
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:00,620
That's me.

2584
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,420
That's what's a fake one at Burt's doing.

2585
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,770
That one was actually real.

2586
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:05,210
Yeah,

2587
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:07,100
he came the hardest ever.

2588
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:08,893
Oh my God.

2589
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,010
Hey,

2590
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,680

cause I know a million people are going

2591
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:13,514

2593
01:06:15,441 --> 01:06:17,450
We'll talk next week.

2594
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:19,160
You're doing cap city
kept sitting next week.

2595
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:22,330
Joey Diaz just did it so to Bunce Tommy,

2596
01:06:22,331 --> 01:06:24,050
but it's just this past weekend.

2597
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:24,470
I'm there.

2598
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:25,191
Not this weekend,

2599
01:06:25,191 --> 01:06:28,430
but next weekend the 20 I didn't even
know Joey was there so I didn't even tweet

2600
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:30,230
it for him and he sold out two shows.

2601
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,480
That is a powerful fucking feeling.

2602
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:33,500
I will tell you right now,

2603
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,920
I'm in there the 20 May 23rd 24th 25th
24th and the 25th of 24th 23rd 24th 25th

2604
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:41,630
of May.

2605
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,290
I'm excited to go back to all to cities.

2606
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:44,020
That shit.

2607
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,230
I would like to live

2608
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:45,981
Texas,

2609
01:06:45,981 --> 01:06:46,640
man.

2610
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,870
I would like to live in Austin.

2611
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:51,980
They look problem with Austin is that
Austin surrounded by some funky areas.

2612
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,080
It's like the Austin itself.

2613
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:54,560
Yeah.

2614
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,880
Austin itself is beautiful.

2615
01:06:55,881 --> 01:06:58,870
The people are progressive people.

2616
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,850
Progressive.

2617
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:00,950
They're interesting.

2618
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:01,940
There's a lot of artists.

2619
01:07:01,941 --> 01:07:02,930
There's a lot of musicians.

2620
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:04,280
This is a lot of like fake,

2621
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,560
fake fucking Dorks,

2622
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,210
fake artistic dorks put.

2623
01:07:08,211 --> 01:07:09,230
That's always going to be the case.

2624
01:07:09,231 --> 01:07:10,280
There's a lot of real ones too.

2625
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:12,350
There's a lot of really good
musicians to come from there.

2626
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,650
I love when you see like someone that
really is like a fucking true artists,

2627
01:07:15,651 --> 01:07:17,360
but it's not something that is like,

2628
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,210
look what worked with a glass blower
down there and she was fucking amazing.

2629
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,530
Hard to make money.

2630
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:23,940
It's very hard to make money class blonde,

2631
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,860
but it's her.

2632
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,180
It's what she digs and you're like,

2633
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,230
that's fucking bad ass.

2634
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:27,831
Yeah,

2635
01:07:27,831 --> 01:07:28,311
it is.

2636
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:29,144
You know,

2637
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:30,130
the,

2638
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:34,160
the ability to pursue like
whatever the fuck excite to,

2639
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,300
to create whatever,

2640
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:36,500
whatever it is.

2641
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,880
It's places that support that.

2642
01:07:37,881 --> 01:07:38,780
It's places that don't.

2643
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:39,410
Yup.

2644
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:41,150
And Austin has a really
good spot for that.

2645
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:41,781
Good comedy.

2646
01:07:41,781 --> 01:07:42,740
They're too good community.

2647
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:43,670
Never done stand up there.

2648
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:46,730
It's fucking amazing TV shows down there.

2649
01:07:46,731 --> 01:07:48,050
But last time was there.

2650
01:07:48,051 --> 01:07:49,850
We sold out a Austin city limits.

2651
01:07:49,851 --> 01:07:50,511
That big theater.

2652
01:07:50,511 --> 01:07:51,650
There was a fantastic,

2653
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,550
is that outdoors?

2654
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:52,921
No,

2655
01:07:52,921 --> 01:07:53,181
no,

2656
01:07:53,181 --> 01:07:53,381
no.

2657
01:07:53,381 --> 01:07:53,930
It's indoor.

2658
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:55,940
It's a beautiful place.

2659
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:56,270
And this is,

2660
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,470
the crowd was alive.

2661
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:58,850
Mance fun.

2662
01:07:58,970 --> 01:07:59,803
So fun.

2663
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:01,070
I'm excited to go down there.

2664
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:01,933
It's Jamie.

2665
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,550
Oh Jamison Cups,

2666
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,020
ice and Ginger Ale.

2667
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:12,830
This part of the episode is now going
to be called going deep with Bert

2668
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:13,010
Kreischer.

2669
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:13,491
It's called.

2670
01:08:13,491 --> 01:08:14,510
It just got real deal.

2671
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:15,650
Squirt Shit.

2672
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:16,190
Just got

2673
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,250
real squirting Jamieson ice.

2674
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,453
Um,

2675
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:22,970
I think we're good right now.

2676
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,331
Yeah,

2677
01:08:23,331 --> 01:08:23,791
that's good.

2678
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:24,500
Yeah.

2679
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,011
Put it together,

2680
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:25,844
Bert.

2681
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:26,973
MMM.

2682
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,100
So where are you going?

2683
01:08:31,101 --> 01:08:32,720
You go into Austin and where else?

2684
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,240
Then I take a week off for that.

2685
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:34,990
I'm in Demoine,

2686
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:36,560
the Philly and Buffalo.

2687
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:37,340
Ooh,

2688
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:37,971
Moines dude.

2689
01:08:37,971 --> 01:08:38,804
I'm fucking,

2690
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:39,351
I go,

2691
01:08:39,351 --> 01:08:40,250
I take a week off,

2692
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:40,741
uh,

2693
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:45,530
after Austin and I'm on the road
every single weekend until Christmas.

2694
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,190
Wow.

2695
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,680
It's the first time in my life
that I'm making money on the road.

2696
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:49,700
Like where you like,

2697
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,390
you get excited,

2698
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,350
you remember that turn?

2699
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,340
Where do you were like,

2700
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:56,090
you're no longer making like say like
breaking even or losing money a lot of

2701
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:56,421
times,

2702
01:08:56,421 --> 01:08:58,160
but you're making money
and it's not a lot,

2703
01:08:58,161 --> 01:08:59,030
but you're just got like,

2704
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,730
you get excited and you're
like fucking and then,

2705
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,930
and I'm writing quicker,

2706
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:03,351
faster,

2707
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:04,730
cleaner than I've ever written.

2708
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:06,680
Like things are getting
on stage really quick.

2709
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:07,230
Men,

2710
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:07,821
I'll tell you,

2711
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:07,951
I've,

2712
01:09:07,951 --> 01:09:12,951
I've taken some very big strides in
finding my voice recently in storytelling.

2713
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:19,420
You forcing me to tell that machine story
on stage has made me so much better of

2714
01:09:19,521 --> 01:09:20,000
a comic.

2715
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,181
Well,

2716
01:09:20,181 --> 01:09:22,490
it's just the stories
themselves are so good.

2717
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,860
It has nothing to do with
me telling you to do it.

2718
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,833
Alpha brain,

2719
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:27,270
awful,

2720
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,103
awful brand.

2721
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,301
Are we just going to do shots,

2722
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:29,511
guys?

2723
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:30,344
You guys going to do a shot?

2724
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,210
Um,

2725
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:32,721
whatever.

2726
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:33,620
You're the fucking,

2727
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:34,993
you're the frat boy,

2728
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,460
frat boy,

2729
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:38,294
bartender.

2730
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,193
I had a,

2731
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:40,661
I have,

2732
01:09:40,661 --> 01:09:41,494
um,

2733
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:42,573
God dammit,

2734
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,980
the guy on my fucking playing yesterday.

2735
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:44,863
How funny is this?

2736
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,310
He gets up and look,

2737
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:46,510
I'm,

2738
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:46,700
I'm,

2739
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,030
I'm fairly sensitive and like,

2740
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:48,851
and like words,

2741
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,220
sometimes I'll just hear it and I'll go,

2742
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,030
oh,

2743
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:52,181
that.

2744
01:09:52,181 --> 01:09:52,661
And he goes,

2745
01:09:52,661 --> 01:09:54,310
he comes up to first class,

2746
01:09:54,311 --> 01:09:55,121
he says [inaudible] the platinum.

2747
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:55,954
And he's like,

2748
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,291
he's like,

2749
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:56,531
Hey,

2750
01:09:56,531 --> 01:09:57,250
uh,

2751
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,480
I'm a total retard.

2752
01:09:58,990 --> 01:09:59,411
He goes,

2753
01:09:59,411 --> 01:09:59,680
uh,

2754
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,510
I was supposed to sub
get up for an upgrade,

2755
01:10:01,511 --> 01:10:02,740
but no upgrade to have.

2756
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,410
So like I'm gonna go run up in up,

2757
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,230
I can't believe what,

2758
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:05,740
how retarded.

2759
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:06,790
He's not like retarded like three times.

2760
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,100
And I'm just sensitive
to that cause I'm like,

2761
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:09,461
man,

2762
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:10,600
like that's a little,

2763
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:11,770
that's like old school.

2764
01:10:11,771 --> 01:10:12,551
Like no,

2765
01:10:12,551 --> 01:10:13,000
right.

2766
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,260
No need,

2767
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,093
no need to use it.

2768
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,790
None use retard anymore.

2769
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,170
Not In that situation.

2770
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,080
You can definitely like your kid
glues his hand to the fucking desk.

2771
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:20,760
Call him a retard,

2772
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,390
but oh,

2773
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,340
you don't call your Kinda
Retard Jesus Christ.

2774
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,391
I'll call my kid one,

2775
01:10:25,391 --> 01:10:26,140
but not I it.

2776
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,130
But it was like in public.

2777
01:10:27,131 --> 01:10:27,431
I was like,

2778
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:27,941
oh my God.

2779
01:10:27,941 --> 01:10:28,751
So do you want to,

2780
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:29,501
how great this was,

2781
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:29,950
man.

2782
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:34,180
He goes up to the front to go get his
upgrade fucking door playing closes and

2783
01:10:34,181 --> 01:10:35,770
they fucking left him there.

2784
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:37,540
Oh really?

2785
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:38,410
Fucking left.

2786
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:38,771
I go,

2787
01:10:38,771 --> 01:10:39,430
stepped down.

2788
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:40,263
He stepped out,

2789
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:42,250
door shut and they fucking left him.

2790
01:10:42,251 --> 01:10:42,640
And I went,

2791
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,290
I wonder if they left
his laptop in there too.

2792
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:45,730
I said to him,

2793
01:10:45,731 --> 01:10:47,170
you need to get all your carry on off.

2794
01:10:47,171 --> 01:10:48,280
The plaintiffs are going
to go talk to them.

2795
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,300
Do you see that once too?

2796
01:10:49,301 --> 01:10:50,920
Or just they've got arrested because a,

2797
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:54,730
the guy left his iPad on the plane and
she took it home and he had a track my

2798
01:10:54,731 --> 01:10:56,230
iPad thing going on.

2799
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:58,203
I'm not drinking.

2800
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,253
Okay.

2801
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,580
It havey if you,

2802
01:11:02,581 --> 01:11:03,940
instead of calling your kid's retarded,

2803
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,040
he caught her kids like niggers.

2804
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:06,150
What did that end racism

2805
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:08,693
wouldn't it?

2806
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:12,090
It would make the word like mean nothing.

2807
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,790
That's an old Lenny joke from 1960.

2808
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,930
Can you give me some
ice because it really,

2809
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:16,170
yeah.

2810
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:16,840
Yes it is.

2811
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,210
Yeah.

2812
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,210
I had a whole thing.

2813
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,030
He had a whole thing about saying
it over and over again til uh,

2814
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,310
so it lose its meaning,

2815
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,133
which is,

2816
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:25,591
yeah.

2817
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:26,041
Which is,

2818
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:26,580
you know,

2819
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:26,821
it's,

2820
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:27,041
there's,

2821
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:28,110
there's some argument to that,

2822
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,780
but culturally it is what it is.

2823
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:31,200
You know,

2824
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,570
the problem with the words like that is,

2825
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,351
yeah.

2826
01:11:34,351 --> 01:11:38,460
Logically it's a stupid thing to
have one word have so much power.

2827
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,730
It's dumb to have like
an upper level insult.

2828
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:42,430
It's,

2829
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:47,430
it's almost like it shows too much power
in what the human language can produce

2830
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:52,740
as opposed to like what
we should allow people to,

2831
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:53,250
uh,

2832
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,420
to affect us by.

2833
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,580
It has way too much power,

2834
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:57,470
you know,

2835
01:11:57,470 --> 01:11:58,080
cause it can,

2836
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,280
someone can call you anything else
and it doesn't have nearly the same.

2837
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:05,600
Like I'm going to fight you
thing as that and that's,

2838
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,340
that is in itself really stupid,

2839
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,080
but it's real.

2840
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,020
So unfortunately it's like you
got those two things to deal with.

2841
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,460
He got your,

2842
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:15,590
you,

2843
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,790
your objective assessment of it,

2844
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,090
which is like this is a stupid
like why is that word so big?

2845
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,260
Why is it such a big deal?

2846
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:22,680
You know,

2847
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,700
isn't intent what's important and the,

2848
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:28,260
and niggers even crazier because black
people are allowed to use it freely

2849
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,490
anytime they want.

2850
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:34,050
They can just toss it back and forth and
no one bats an eye but a white person.

2851
01:12:34,051 --> 01:12:35,610
Even in using it the way I did it.

2852
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:39,090
Just saying that it is a
word not calling anyone in,

2853
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:40,710
not defining it,

2854
01:12:40,711 --> 01:12:44,280
just saying this is the name
of that word is controversial.

2855
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:45,750
It's hilarious.

2856
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:49,800
It's a really one of the most
ridiculous aspects of our culture,

2857
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,350
but it is an aspect of our culture.

2858
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,830
So it's like in exposing it,

2859
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:58,950
you got to give people the option to
recognize how ridiculous it is and then

2860
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:00,600
eventually we'll probably move past it,

2861
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,200
but we're stuck in this
like swampy adolescent area,

2862
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:04,990
what was developed.

2863
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:06,790
We're still stuck there
because there is a,

2864
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:11,791
there's a large group of the population
of black people who were alive when that

2865
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:15,160
word meant a really not
meant what was used.

2866
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:16,123
Me Too,

2867
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:16,650
man.

2868
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:16,721
No,

2869
01:13:16,721 --> 01:13:16,961
no,

2870
01:13:16,961 --> 01:13:17,141
no,

2871
01:13:17,141 --> 01:13:17,351
no.

2872
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:17,831
I knew it was it.

2873
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:18,810
Now someone's angry.

2874
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:18,980
Yeah,

2875
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:23,070
but what I'm saying is what I'm saying
is there's a group of like say 50 to 70

2876
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:24,630
year old black people
where that word was very,

2877
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,410
now the the,

2878
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:29,190
I'd say the hip hop youth uses
it as a term of endearment often.

2879
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:29,451
Right.

2880
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:34,451
But what we're talking about is once you
get to a place where maybe racism is,

2881
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:35,540
is,

2882
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:36,420
is built and,

2883
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:36,990
and,

2884
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,340
and we're a little past that,

2885
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,391
I think maybe then the,

2886
01:13:39,391 --> 01:13:40,290
the power from the word,

2887
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,100
the power of the word.

2888
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,470
I mean there's still people still alive
that had crosses burned in the front of

2889
01:13:43,471 --> 01:13:44,304
their house.

2890
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,000
Like that's,

2891
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,211
I mean,

2892
01:13:45,211 --> 01:13:46,044
that word was,

2893
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:46,883
should fear.

2894
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:47,940
Did he really know?

2895
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,273
Imagine.

2896
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,000
Yeah.

2897
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,410
Why would you do that to a Jewish person?

2898
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:55,811
Hey,

2899
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:56,710
have you heard this?

2900
01:13:56,711 --> 01:13:58,120
A Phil Ivy Story?

2901
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,000
Do you know about the
story of Phil Ivey got,

2902
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:00,880
looks like tiger woods.

2903
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:02,860
Phil Ivey is the guy that
looks like tiger woods.

2904
01:14:02,861 --> 01:14:06,430
He's apparently the best
poker player on earth.

2905
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:07,990
And this gentleman,

2906
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:08,860
uh,

2907
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:13,860
went to a British casino
and he won $11 million,

2908
01:14:14,511 --> 01:14:19,511
11 point $9 million in one spectacular
run of a game called Punto Blanco.

2909
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,160
It's a buck or rock game.

2910
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:23,510
I don't really know how that,

2911
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,433
how that goes,

2912
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:29,710
but he is charged with observing tiny
flaws in the games card and then using

2913
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:33,890
that knowledge to give,

2914
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,900
give the house a severe thrashing.

2915
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,850
He one's like all this money.

2916
01:14:37,851 --> 01:14:42,410
When he was down at one
point $770,000 he was down.

2917
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,840
So he noticed that there
was a mark in the cards.

2918
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:49,930
This is the what the casino saying
alleging fucked up because he knows the

2919
01:14:50,031 --> 01:14:51,110
legend deck game.

2920
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,200
I do not know anything about this game.

2921
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:56,060
I know zero about this game,

2922
01:14:56,061 --> 01:14:59,960
but I do know that one of the things
that they're saying is that he talked the

2923
01:14:59,961 --> 01:15:01,760
dealer into not changing the deck.

2924
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:05,510
What stupid that they let them do that.

2925
01:15:05,511 --> 01:15:05,751
Okay.

2926
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,570
This should never would
never flied in Vegas.

2927
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:09,151
They would,

2928
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:09,230
uh,

2929
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:10,450
they would have moved in and going,

2930
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,270
what's going on here?

2931
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:12,380
How come you haven't changed that deck?

2932
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:12,920
Yeah.

2933
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,380
Like people have developed,

2934
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:16,101
you know,

2935
01:15:16,101 --> 01:15:20,000
all sorts of methods of counting
cards and they've developed,

2936
01:15:20,001 --> 01:15:22,930
developed all these methods of
like trying to like control and,

2937
01:15:22,931 --> 01:15:23,161
and,

2938
01:15:23,161 --> 01:15:23,471
and,

2939
01:15:23,471 --> 01:15:27,890
and make rational choices about
what's the next car going to be.

2940
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,870
So then they figured out
how to mitigate that.

2941
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:31,380
They just bring an extra cards.

2942
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,420
It put an extra decks.

2943
01:15:32,421 --> 01:15:33,290
They throw it all together.

2944
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,153
It's the dealers.

2945
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,073
Yeah.

2946
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:35,431
They,

2947
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:35,960
um,

2948
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:40,580
apparently so it got this guy got
up to some insane amount per bet.

2949
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,880
He started at $77,000 per hand and then
he raised it with the casinos blessing

2950
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,600
up to $230,000 per hand.

2951
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,190
Wow Dude.

2952
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:56,910
Stop and think about that cause I was
playing 230 and it's apparently again it's

2953
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:58,970
very similar to um,

2954
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:04,190
it's very similar to black jack and and
like the odds and how you win and lose.

2955
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,130
Like sometimes people do well and
sometimes people crash and burn,

2956
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,110
but he apparently just pounded on them
and they don't want to give him the

2957
01:16:12,111 --> 01:16:12,650
money.

2958
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:17,650
But I say like if the
guy was down $770,000

2959
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,680
one again,

2960
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:25,050
and what kind of a a an
advantage does he really have?

2961
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:26,303
You know what,

2962
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,410
how come you fucked up then

2963
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,630
going on monies.

2964
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:31,330
Monies not even real to him.

2965
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,490
See what's making it look realistic.

2966
01:16:33,491 --> 01:16:35,680
Like I better used to go
down for the next five hands,

2967
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:36,250
you know what I mean?

2968
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,083
That's what I would do.

2969
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,010
That's a very good one of the 11.9.

2970
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,920
He might have that advantage
where he can be like,

2971
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,250
that is a very good point.

2972
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:44,120
Um,

2973
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:44,391
you know,

2974
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:46,670
that's a big move with pool players,

2975
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:48,110
but that's a move.

2976
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:48,710
Oh Man.

2977
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:49,550
To rake you in.

2978
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:49,770
I mean,

2979
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:50,930
it's a classic move you,

2980
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,340
it's from the movie the Hustler.

2981
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:55,800
When Forrest Whitaker place
Paul Newman and he acts like a,

2982
01:16:55,801 --> 01:16:56,060
uh,

2983
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,160
like a mental patient
when he first meets him,

2984
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,160
he tells him that they did all
experiments on them and shit like that.

2985
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,900
And then as the game gets better,

2986
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,120
they kept forced,

2987
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:05,900
pays him for a bit at first,

2988
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:08,180
and then he starts playing
really fucking good.

2989
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,440
And he,

2990
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,070
that Paul Newman by this time is drunk
and he's losing all of his money.

2991
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:15,680
And at the end he bought
to give him the money.

2992
01:17:15,681 --> 01:17:16,120
He goes,

2993
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,180
are you a Hustler Amos?

2994
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,470
Are you a hustler?

2995
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,020
He goes,

2996
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:19,791
he'll have to pay me,

2997
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:20,624
man.

2998
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,350
It's cool.

2999
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,531
I mean,

3000
01:17:21,531 --> 01:17:22,760
I wanted no bad feelings.

3001
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:23,893
Yeah.

3002
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:26,401
Yeah.

3003
01:17:26,401 --> 01:17:30,270
But playing on people's Egos in a pool
game is very different than a card game.

3004
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,220
There's no playing on the egos here.

3005
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:33,091
We did that.

3006
01:17:33,091 --> 01:17:36,570
I told you about why you dump me
and my buddy did that in a um,

3007
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:38,040
in upstate New York.

3008
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,210
Didn't hustle people.

3009
01:17:39,211 --> 01:17:40,110
We were playing this game.

3010
01:17:40,111 --> 01:17:41,000
I think I told you about it.

3011
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:42,450
We put two balls in each pocket,

3012
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:43,703
back to back,

3013
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:46,980
three balls in the center and then you
get a cue ball to the guy and you say,

3014
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:47,371
all right,

3015
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:48,510
it's five bucks to buy.

3016
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,051
If you win,

3017
01:17:49,051 --> 01:17:49,890
I'll give you 50.

3018
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,450
You've got to run the table.

3019
01:17:51,451 --> 01:17:52,320
You can't miss a shot.

3020
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:53,843
And it's him.

3021
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,080
It's only four balls.

3022
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:55,440
No,

3023
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,060
there's every ball on the table too.

3024
01:17:57,061 --> 01:17:59,650
And each pocket you have
to shoot two in each box.

3025
01:17:59,670 --> 01:17:59,971
You know,

3026
01:17:59,971 --> 01:18:00,570
there's,

3027
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:01,351
I set it up like this.

3028
01:18:01,351 --> 01:18:03,090
I put two back to back in this pocket.

3029
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,320
How many balls are on the table?

3030
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:05,150
Every single box.

3031
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,000
Every 15 balls.

3032
01:18:06,001 --> 01:18:06,481
15 balls,

3033
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:07,141
three in the center,

3034
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:08,070
two in each pocket.

3035
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,090
And I give them the cue ball.

3036
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,141
Three in the center,

3037
01:18:10,141 --> 01:18:11,280
like lined up in the center.

3038
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,810
Do you want him to run
them in order or any order?

3039
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,350
All you gotta do is not miss.

3040
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,280
Just run the table.

3041
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:17,570
It's really difficult.

3042
01:18:17,571 --> 01:18:20,600
It's difficult for an average pool player
mean probably you could probably do

3043
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:21,320
it.

3044
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,360
It just depends on if
the balls are broken.

3045
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:25,970
If the balls are broken
and there's no clusters,

3046
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:26,411
there's what?

3047
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:27,500
What keeps you from running out?

3048
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:28,330
It's clusters.

3049
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:29,021
So it's like this.

3050
01:18:29,021 --> 01:18:29,650
It's like this.

3051
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:30,830
It's like,

3052
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,050
like this is the pocket.

3053
01:18:32,051 --> 01:18:33,310
There's two balls like this,

3054
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:33,610
right?

3055
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:34,061
Does the pocket,

3056
01:18:34,061 --> 01:18:34,990
there's two balls like this.

3057
01:18:34,991 --> 01:18:36,040
There's two balls like this.

3058
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:36,371
Okay.

3059
01:18:36,371 --> 01:18:40,270
No one knows you're sitting on it and
then there's three in the center I think

3060
01:18:40,271 --> 01:18:40,450
I,

3061
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,170
okay,

3062
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:45,820
so what the thing is is what will happen
is if you play with intent and you just

3063
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:48,280
try to tap 'em in and move your ball,

3064
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:49,540
move the cue ball to the next one in,

3065
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,380
line up your next shot,

3066
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:51,071
you'll do it.

3067
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:54,910
What happens is you're going to get left
with like three balls on the table with

3068
01:18:54,911 --> 01:18:56,380
a couple long odd shots.

3069
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:57,390
That sounds like wind.

3070
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,380
That's a soccer game.

3071
01:18:58,450 --> 01:18:59,800
It definitely was.

3072
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,790
You're only saying that you're going
to get left with those odd shots.

3073
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:03,970
We don't know how to play it.

3074
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:04,943
The majority.

3075
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:06,460
Yeah,

3076
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:06,901
but that's,

3077
01:19:06,901 --> 01:19:08,310
why would they be playing that?

3078
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:10,560
Because it seems it looks so easy.

3079
01:19:10,561 --> 01:19:12,750
Me and my buddy easy to run 15 balls.

3080
01:19:12,751 --> 01:19:13,584
That's fucking hard.

3081
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,240
It's if you ever play straight pool,

3082
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:16,200
straight pools,

3083
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,320
essentially the godfather of
all pools and with street food,

3084
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,750
it's also called 14 one continuous.

3085
01:19:21,751 --> 01:19:25,260
That was what they used to play back in
the old days when the gentleman gamblers

3086
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,370
of like the Hustler era,

3087
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:29,400
they'd play for thousands and thousands
of dollars in play street pool.

3088
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:30,390
That was a man's game.

3089
01:19:30,690 --> 01:19:32,430
And with straight pool is every ball.

3090
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:32,820
Yeah.

3091
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:36,750
You call every single
shot and every ball you,

3092
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:39,420
you can choose any dang
stripes are solids,

3093
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:43,080
but at you leave one ball left and you
shoot that ball in and the cue ball

3094
01:19:43,081 --> 01:19:44,790
smashes the rack and you continue gun.

3095
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,670
And there's guys that have run
hundreds of hundreds of balls.

3096
01:19:47,671 --> 01:19:48,481
Like my friend Max,

3097
01:19:48,481 --> 01:19:50,070
I believe he's run 200 balls.

3098
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,330
That's like a big number.

3099
01:19:51,331 --> 01:19:51,801
Like run out.

3100
01:19:51,801 --> 01:19:52,920
I've never run a hundred balls,

3101
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:55,740
but a hundred balls is like when you
were a legit straight pool player.

3102
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:56,150
Yeah.

3103
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:56,460
Yeah.

3104
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:56,821
I've never,

3105
01:19:56,821 --> 01:19:58,800
I think I've run like 50 maybe more,

3106
01:19:58,801 --> 01:19:59,634
maybe a little more,

3107
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:00,550
but that's about it.

3108
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,920
I haven't played

3109
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,753
in so long.

3110
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,160
I used to be really good.

3111
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,380
So Eddie and I did this
in part in New York.

3112
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:05,921
We needed money.

3113
01:20:05,921 --> 01:20:08,850
We were broke and so just started saying,

3114
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:09,001
you know,

3115
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:10,140
we line up the table and some guys,

3116
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:10,681
what are you doing and go,

3117
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:10,721
Hey,

3118
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:11,340
I'm going to try it.

3119
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,990
We've known each other
five bucks to buy in,

3120
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,030
would buy him for five and couldn't do it.

3121
01:20:15,031 --> 01:20:15,840
Couldn't do it.

3122
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,860
Then he'd bring his friends over.

3123
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:19,050
Couldn't do it was definitely a hustle.

3124
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:19,381
Here's the,

3125
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,330
here's the rub is that
we couldn't do it either.

3126
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:22,800
Like it was hard to do for us.

3127
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,910
That's a way to make money.

3128
01:20:23,911 --> 01:20:24,691
If you're a pool player,

3129
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:27,660
it's a better guy that he can't do it
because this is most likely not going to

3130
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:28,141
do it that way.

3131
01:20:28,141 --> 01:20:29,310
You don't even have to play him.

3132
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:30,211
Exactly.

3133
01:20:30,211 --> 01:20:31,080
That's what guys do.

3134
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:32,520
That's called playing the ghost,

3135
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:33,870
but playing the ghost,

3136
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:36,840
you get to break and then you get
ball in hand and most people lose.

3137
01:20:36,841 --> 01:20:37,674
To the ghost.

3138
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,930
The ghost is like say
if you wanted to play.

3139
01:20:39,931 --> 01:20:40,350
Um,

3140
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:41,580
it's a good way to practice too.

3141
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:44,100
He'd say you're going
to play a race to 10.

3142
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:44,941
Okay.

3143
01:20:44,941 --> 01:20:48,210
And Raisa 10 for like 1000 bucks
and you're going to play the ghost.

3144
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:49,830
That would mean only your playing.

3145
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,120
You break the balls and then you get ball
in hand and then from there you try to

3146
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:54,750
run out.

3147
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:55,770
If you don't run out,

3148
01:20:55,771 --> 01:20:56,351
you lose.

3149
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,240
And the ghost wins.

3150
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,433
She goes to ghost.

3151
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,570
You gotta assume that every time
you missed the ghost runs out.

3152
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:00,960
Yeah.

3153
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,080
So you break and run out every game
and most people lose to the ghost.

3154
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,580
Nine ball or April 10 ball.

3155
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:06,330
10 Ball.

3156
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:06,540
Yes.

3157
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:06,960
10 balls.

3158
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:07,381
10 balls,

3159
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:08,071
like nine ball.

3160
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:09,000
But it has an extra ball.

3161
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:11,183
Well,

3162
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:12,160
it's an,

3163
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,240
it's an rotation game.

3164
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,460
It's the same thing.

3165
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,271
It's a rotation game,

3166
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:15,851
meaning you,

3167
01:21:15,851 --> 01:21:19,560
you shoot balls one through 10 and you
have to make contact with the lowest

3168
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:20,371
number of rack,

3169
01:21:20,371 --> 01:21:21,060
10 balls,

3170
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,980
you rack them like a mini eight ball rack.

3171
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,113
Okay.

3172
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:24,810
Um,

3173
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:25,081
yeah,

3174
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:25,680
that,

3175
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,940
that is fascinating.

3176
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,800
I,

3177
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,800
I used to love,

3178
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:31,800
we had a pool table in her house for a
couple of years in college and that's all

3179
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:32,634
we did.

3180
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:34,520
That like what you're doing is like,

3181
01:21:34,521 --> 01:21:37,220
it's a really smart thing to
do because you don't have any,

3182
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:38,241
when you want,

3183
01:21:38,241 --> 01:21:39,470
where you want to do with a person.

3184
01:21:39,471 --> 01:21:41,900
If you're playing pool with them
and she want to get them to shoot,

3185
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,640
if you can get them to shoot,

3186
01:21:43,641 --> 01:21:44,474
you can win.

3187
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:46,790
And if you can get them to
shoot playing the ghost,

3188
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:47,420
you can win.

3189
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:47,750
You can,

3190
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:48,140
you can,

3191
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:50,090
you can find a way to win
as long as they're shooting.

3192
01:21:50,091 --> 01:21:51,020
But when you're shooting

3193
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,021
that can lose.

3194
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:54,450
That's where we got caught
speaking loose as soon as it was.

3195
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,410
These guys were,

3196
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,760
these guys were cool and we ended up
going to a horse track with them the next

3197
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,090
day.

3198
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:02,280
But they were playing over and over again
and they were getting pissed because

3199
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:04,470
you get real close but you get close,

3200
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:09,150
you got like three balls left and they're
just odd shots and it's a wide open

3201
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:09,421
table.

3202
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:12,360
Now 15 balls is a lot of balls to run.

3203
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,040
But it looks don't simple.

3204
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:14,923
The only for idiots.

3205
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:15,120
Yup,

3206
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:15,953
exactly.

3207
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,310
So then they said,

3208
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,593
fuck you,

3209
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:19,493
this can't be done.

3210
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,280
And I'm like,

3211
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,113
it can be done.

3212
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:21,910
And I go,

3213
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:22,120
it's,

3214
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,220
everything is possible.

3215
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,320
I'm just saying it and we tell them
at the beginning it's a very hard,

3216
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:29,010
didn't see that's when you need a pro
player right next to him who just runs

3217
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:29,844
those balls out.

3218
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,050
It makes it look easy.

3219
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:31,411
I did.

3220
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:32,610
And then that you did it,

3221
01:22:32,611 --> 01:22:33,000
did it.

3222
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,661
And let me tell you something.

3223
01:22:33,661 --> 01:22:36,710
I did it done it maybe four times total
in my life because we used to do this in

3224
01:22:36,711 --> 01:22:38,730
the in our fraternity house all
the time and I fucking did it.

3225
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:39,080
And the guy,

3226
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:39,511
I was like,

3227
01:22:39,511 --> 01:22:39,841
I was like,

3228
01:22:39,841 --> 01:22:40,140
all right,

3229
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:40,511
I'll show you.

3230
01:22:40,511 --> 01:22:40,831
I'll watch.

3231
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:41,664
Let me show you how it's done.

3232
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:42,720
It's very simple,

3233
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:42,960
right?

3234
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,010
Start off with a ball in the center,

3235
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:46,290
run one to the side pocket and tap,

3236
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:46,621
tap.

3237
01:22:46,621 --> 01:22:47,910
Leave it right up against the other ball.

3238
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:49,110
Then come back the other direction.

3239
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:50,970
A little descriptive
for this imaginary game.

3240
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:52,080
It's not really even happening,

3241
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,730
but you're doing commentary and a game.

3242
01:22:53,731 --> 01:22:54,600
And going out of your head.

3243
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:55,080
Yeah,

3244
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:55,351
so,

3245
01:22:55,351 --> 01:22:55,981
but I did it.

3246
01:22:55,981 --> 01:22:57,810
I ended up running the
table and they were like,

3247
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:58,620
oh.

3248
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,870
And then we had him for another fucking
10 rounds because they were like,

3249
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:01,321
all right,

3250
01:23:01,321 --> 01:23:01,921
now I gotta fuck.

3251
01:23:01,921 --> 01:23:02,790
Now I know how it's done.

3252
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,241
Wow,

3253
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:04,560
that seems like a good hustle.

3254
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:05,860
If one's going to steal that,

3255
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:06,070
they're going

3256
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,190
to call that the machine hustle.

3257
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:10,290
That's the new machine hustle.

3258
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:11,530
That's a good hustle by the way.

3259
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:12,340
It's a great hustle.

3260
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:14,620
It's a good hustle and you
should even let the guy break.

3261
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:15,543
Let a guy break.

3262
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:17,170
Cause especially if by the way,

3263
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,640
15 balls,

3264
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:20,680
even if you get to shoot every ball,

3265
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:22,330
whenever we want stripes or solids,

3266
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:24,580
you still have an issue
with balls clustering up.

3267
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,800
Most people do not know
how to break that up.

3268
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:28,240
You don't know how to plan for it.

3269
01:23:28,241 --> 01:23:29,260
You don't know how to do it.

3270
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:29,881
You're not.

3271
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:31,930
You're going to get stuck
where you got no shot.

3272
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:34,150
That's the odds are much higher.

3273
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:35,560
Like that's a real sucker bet.

3274
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:36,910
The right way to do that.

3275
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,380
You should have like
five to one on the money.

3276
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,860
That's where someone should be saying
like you should have to give up five to

3277
01:23:41,861 --> 01:23:45,910
ever one that they gather and then
they play that you gave them 10 to one.

3278
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:47,750
We said if you hit when
we'll give you 50 bucks,

3279
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:48,980
it'd be five to buy in.

3280
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:50,020
Oh my God.

3281
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,110
That was how you were doing.

3282
01:23:51,111 --> 01:23:51,471
Okay.

3283
01:23:51,471 --> 01:23:51,661
That will,

3284
01:23:51,661 --> 01:23:51,890
that,

3285
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:52,820
that's even different.

3286
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:53,830
I learned it in Russia.

3287
01:23:53,831 --> 01:23:54,321
It was,

3288
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:55,250
it was seven to one.

3289
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,500
So seven one five buck by and you walk
away with 35 and it was straight pool.

3290
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:00,750
This,

3291
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,570
this sees a long time
to make money though.

3292
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:03,920
Straight fuels one of them.

3293
01:24:03,921 --> 01:24:04,310
You're fine.

3294
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:04,431
Wait,

3295
01:24:04,431 --> 01:24:04,551
wait,

3296
01:24:04,551 --> 01:24:04,671
wait.

3297
01:24:04,671 --> 01:24:05,211
Let me take that back.

3298
01:24:05,211 --> 01:24:05,901
Let me take that back.

3299
01:24:05,901 --> 01:24:06,734
Gets out.

3300
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:07,820
Hold on.

3301
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:08,653
It is,

3302
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:09,950
it was,

3303
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:10,783
I take that back.

3304
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,890
I think this is what it was third,

3305
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:13,680
cause it's all,

3306
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:17,790
I'm coming to you for facts no
matter what from now on fucking,

3307
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:19,190
I'm so unreliable.

3308
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:24,480
It was straight pool slop counted
and it you gotta you gotta uh,

3309
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,150
a dollar percentage.

3310
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,370
Every time you sunk a ball
for every ball you got,

3311
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:29,660
it was $35 to buy in.

3312
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:32,430
And then everything over
that you got to keep and,

3313
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:35,120
but I didn't realize the first time I
played I was calling shots and I was with,

3314
01:24:35,121 --> 01:24:38,330
my dad got Igor and he was watching me
and I was calling shots and he's like,

3315
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,700
you don't need to call the shots
when you were playing in Russia,

3316
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:41,061
in Russia,

3317
01:24:41,061 --> 01:24:41,900
when I was in Russia,

3318
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:42,880
we went to a,

3319
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,180
they have a different game over there,

3320
01:24:44,181 --> 01:24:44,391
right?

3321
01:24:44,391 --> 01:24:45,590
They have Russian billiards.

3322
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:47,630
It was a huge fucking table.

3323
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,740
Huge table.

3324
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:49,850
I want to say it was more than,

3325
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:50,810
I want to say it was more balls,

3326
01:24:50,811 --> 01:24:51,800
but it was basically,

3327
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,000
it was straight pool.

3328
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:53,701
Now that you said it,

3329
01:24:53,701 --> 01:24:54,750
I'd never played the game before.

3330
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,540
Maybe I'm wrong because I thought they'd
mostly played like Russian billiards

3331
01:24:59,541 --> 01:24:59,871
over there,

3332
01:24:59,871 --> 01:25:00,980
but I've never been there.

3333
01:25:00,981 --> 01:25:01,180
So yeah,

3334
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:01,770
it was,

3335
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:02,100
no,

3336
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,390
it was one huge table.

3337
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,530
They have a different game though,

3338
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:05,693
and it was just,

3339
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,860
and it was like you buy
in against the house,

3340
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:12,420
you buy a dollar percentage
and then every ball you hit in,

3341
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,100
you earn a dollar percentage back.

3342
01:25:14,101 --> 01:25:15,330
So it's like every ball
is worth five bucks.

3343
01:25:15,331 --> 01:25:16,230
I'm giving you a numbers,

3344
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,670
it's $35 to buy in.

3345
01:25:17,671 --> 01:25:18,720
Every is worth five bucks.

3346
01:25:18,721 --> 01:25:19,211
So if you six,

3347
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:20,044
seven balls,

3348
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:20,640
you're,

3349
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,211
you're in the break.

3350
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:22,680
And then if you run the rest of the table,

3351
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:23,250
you do it.

3352
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,840
So we do you get extra money.

3353
01:25:24,841 --> 01:25:26,100
So the first time we did it,

3354
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,870
I was calling shots and,

3355
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,130
and I missed,

3356
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,113
I lost my money.

3357
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:30,901
The other guy went in,

3358
01:25:30,901 --> 01:25:31,560
he was the,

3359
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,760
the guy that worked there who did this
against everyone and he started fucking

3360
01:25:35,761 --> 01:25:36,570
running the table,

3361
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:37,740
but he slopped counted.

3362
01:25:37,741 --> 01:25:39,360
He didn't have to call any fucking shots.

3363
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,260
So I said to Igor,

3364
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,800
I go,

3365
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,190
hold on.

3366
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:42,090
You can just fucking,

3367
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,021
he was doing those,

3368
01:25:43,021 --> 01:25:43,171
you know,

3369
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:46,380
when you run the pool cue through
and it's just out ball start running

3370
01:25:46,381 --> 01:25:47,214
everywhere.

3371
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,233
He was doing that.

3372
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:50,011
And so,

3373
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:50,460
uh,

3374
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:51,300
I said to you where I go,

3375
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:52,080
that's bullshit.

3376
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:52,740
And he goes,

3377
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:52,911
Oh yeah,

3378
01:25:52,911 --> 01:25:53,551
you don't have to call him.

3379
01:25:53,551 --> 01:25:54,384
He just had a men.

3380
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,260
So I was like,

3381
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:55,940
oh fuck.

3382
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:57,260
Is this the game that you saw?

3383
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:57,680
It's like,

3384
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:58,820
it's Russian billiards.

3385
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:02,030
It looks like it's a sneaker
table and they're all white balls.

3386
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:04,040
It was probably drunk and it was

3387
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,080
like 1520 years ago.

3388
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:06,771
Okay.

3389
01:26:06,771 --> 01:26:07,430
You don't remember?

3390
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,061
I may have a,

3391
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:09,140
they have a weird game,

3392
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,280
but they may have been

3393
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,220
play over there.

3394
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:16,140
It's like pool on a snooker table with
big balls and all the balls are white.

3395
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:16,631
It's really,

3396
01:26:16,631 --> 01:26:17,390
yeah.

3397
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:19,160
Is it straight pool where
you just run the table?

3398
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:19,781
Oh Man.

3399
01:26:19,781 --> 01:26:22,930
I don't know anything about
the rules of Russian billiards,

3400
01:26:22,931 --> 01:26:26,320
but Russians is just such a
strange group of white people.

3401
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:28,870
They're the strangest motherfuckers man.

3402
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:33,580
But the point of the point of the ego
story is I started really like hamming it

3403
01:26:33,581 --> 01:26:36,670
up and doing the Tom
Cruise from color of money.

3404
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:38,830
Samurai chops with the pool cue did.

3405
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:39,041
Yeah.

3406
01:26:39,041 --> 01:26:41,980
I was like really fucking to
spend that or pull me aside.

3407
01:26:41,981 --> 01:26:42,281
He was like,

3408
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:43,300
time to start losing.

3409
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:43,811
And I was like,

3410
01:26:43,811 --> 01:26:44,110
what?

3411
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:48,010
And I realize I'm winning money at a
bar with a bunch of fucking gangsters.

3412
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:48,700
Oh yeah.

3413
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:49,181
And he was like,

3414
01:26:49,181 --> 01:26:49,810
just lose.

3415
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:50,291
Just lose them.

3416
01:26:50,291 --> 01:26:51,124
Let's go home.

3417
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:51,880
And I was like,

3418
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:52,713
ah,

3419
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,440
fuck it.

3420
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,273
All my money.

3421
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:57,190
Sometimes you got to lose to
walk out and win because they,

3422
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,940
what are you?

3423
01:26:57,940 --> 01:26:58,181
He goes,

3424
01:26:58,181 --> 01:26:59,460
I'm not going to bring
over to the tech to you.

3425
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:01,140
You've got a bunch of fucking
cat rubles in your pocket.

3426
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,620
You're walking out like
a fucking lot American.

3427
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:03,521
Yeah.

3428
01:27:03,521 --> 01:27:07,420
You don't want to be doing it
like I'm fucking Tom Cruise.

3429
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:08,500
Such a pain.

3430
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,800
I was drunk when he too.

3431
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,310
I would never go with
you to another country.

3432
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:14,140
Oh fucking come on.

3433
01:27:14,141 --> 01:27:14,620
Ever.

3434
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:17,860
I would be a blast up until
the point where we get shot.

3435
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,780
That guy doesn't exist anymore.

3436
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:20,730
This is a bag over.

3437
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:23,560
Our heads were in the back of a truck
bounce around through the desert.

3438
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:24,641
Joe,

3439
01:27:24,641 --> 01:27:25,474
can you hear me?

3440
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:27,040
You're chokes.

3441
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:28,180
Fucking sock.

3442
01:27:28,181 --> 01:27:29,590
We stopped with that shit.

3443
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:32,950
You fucked with those people in a truck.

3444
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:35,590
So this Phil Ivey

3445
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:36,100
Ivy game.

3446
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,890
Apparently it was the same
game that a James Bond played.

3447
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:41,640
Punto Blanco Bonko bonkers.

3448
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:42,533
It's like white horse.

3449
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:44,590
It's a sister game of oh,

3450
01:27:44,591 --> 01:27:44,861
okay.

3451
01:27:44,861 --> 01:27:49,861
It's assisted game of Kim and defer the
game that preferred by James Bond Shemen

3452
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:52,150
Shemen differ.

3453
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:53,351
C,

3454
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:53,801
h e,

3455
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:54,041
m,

3456
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:54,251
I,

3457
01:27:54,251 --> 01:27:54,641
N,

3458
01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:54,881
d,

3459
01:27:54,881 --> 01:27:55,091
e,

3460
01:27:55,091 --> 01:27:55,360
f.

3461
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:55,650
Ah,

3462
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:56,483
the,

3463
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:58,970
the high stakes game
preferred by James Bond.

3464
01:27:59,470 --> 01:28:00,670
If he was real.

3465
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:01,990
Yeah.

3466
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:03,610
So I don't know what the
fuck's going to happen.

3467
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:04,270
The they,

3468
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:04,451
they,

3469
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:04,601
oh,

3470
01:28:04,601 --> 01:28:06,100
this dude a shitload of money.

3471
01:28:06,101 --> 01:28:08,410
They owed him millions of dollars.

3472
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:12,760
So it's going to be interesting to see
if they can prove that he was doing that

3473
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,130
or if he just got fucking lucky.

3474
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:15,791
Well,

3475
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:16,601
there's no way to prove it now,

3476
01:28:16,601 --> 01:28:17,020
right?

3477
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:17,621
I Dunno man.

3478
01:28:17,621 --> 01:28:17,910
They,

3479
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:18,760
they have the deck.

3480
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:19,810
I mean they,

3481
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:22,300
they're able to withhold the money,

3482
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:23,830
which I think is hilarious.

3483
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,330
It's like that,

3484
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,530
that in and of itself,

3485
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:29,530
that's like a violation of the contract
that you made when you went in.

3486
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:32,490
If you can't prove that
someone's cheating and they won,

3487
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,340
yeah.

3488
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:36,820
It's up to you to prove it
before you withhold money.

3489
01:28:36,821 --> 01:28:37,960
You can't just say,

3490
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:39,650
you think that he was doing this.

3491
01:28:39,651 --> 01:28:43,250
So you think that maybe the symmetrical
cards or perhaps it's asymmetrical if

3492
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,940
you coming up with a bunch of reasons
why you think that this guy stole money

3493
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:46,750
from you.

3494
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:49,570
But that's a weird thing to just allow
this company because it has so much

3495
01:28:49,571 --> 01:28:50,050
money.

3496
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:54,190
It allow them to just steal money
when they feel like they were fucked.

3497
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:56,170
Whereas almost everybody goes in there,

3498
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:57,940
feels like they were
fucked and no one cares.

3499
01:28:58,270 --> 01:28:58,601
And when,

3500
01:28:58,601 --> 01:29:01,620
when ivy was down 770,000
what if he and said,

3501
01:29:01,621 --> 01:29:01,980
you know what?

3502
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,770
I think this game is rigged and a,

3503
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:05,430
I'm not paying you until I go to court.

3504
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,650
What if every time someone lost money,

3505
01:29:07,651 --> 01:29:08,820
it was that same arrangement.

3506
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,170
You would go bankrupt.

3507
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:11,970
They would go bankrupt
because everybody would do it.

3508
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:12,810
Everybody would dispute it.

3509
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:13,350
Because if you,

3510
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:15,300
if you win or they give up,

3511
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,380
you don't have to pay.

3512
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,191
But if you lose,

3513
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:17,791
you have to pay.

3514
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,990
So everybody would try to
dispute it in court if,

3515
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,450
if everybody could do what they're doing,

3516
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,700
what they're doing is
unbelievably douchey.

3517
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,690
Casinos exist to lose
money or to make money.

3518
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:28,231
They exist.

3519
01:29:28,231 --> 01:29:29,430
So other people lose money.

3520
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:31,230
And if other people stop losing money,

3521
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:32,070
they're fucked.

3522
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:33,330
Their business models a mess.

3523
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:35,460
So their business model is inequality,

3524
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:37,860
their business model ripping you off.

3525
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:38,510
I mean it's,

3526
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:40,110
it's the most ridiculous shit ever.

3527
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,790
It's like the only way they can have
these giant buildings is if you fucking

3528
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:45,510
lose.

3529
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:46,500
And if you win,

3530
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,490
they can boot you out.

3531
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:51,570
Like there's a reason why the UFC doesn't
go back to the palms cause cause Dana

3532
01:29:51,571 --> 01:29:52,860
white wiped him out.

3533
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:57,480
He plays high stakes blackjacks and he
wiped them out and the next time he went

3534
01:29:57,481 --> 01:29:59,760
back they tried to give him half the,

3535
01:29:59,761 --> 01:29:59,901
uh,

3536
01:29:59,901 --> 01:30:03,450
the credit limit because if
he only has half the credit,

3537
01:30:03,451 --> 01:30:03,810
can't,

3538
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:04,920
he can't come back.

3539
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:05,881
Can't come back.

3540
01:30:05,881 --> 01:30:10,290
Like the whole idea about blackjack and
gambling is you gotta be ready to go

3541
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:13,530
into a deep hole in order
to win a lot of money.

3542
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:15,300
You gotta be prepared
to lose a lot of money.

3543
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:18,390
And Dana's last as much as a
million dollars in a night.

3544
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,940
I said he's one of those
scary guys to them.

3545
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:22,023
How's he goes in?

3546
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,891
I don't know.

3547
01:30:22,891 --> 01:30:23,701
I don't understand.

3548
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:24,510
I don't understand.

3549
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:27,240
We had him in here and respectfully
because I love him and he's my brother.

3550
01:30:27,241 --> 01:30:28,460
I tried to suggest that maybe yes,

3551
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,353
brain damage.

3552
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,573
It's true.

3553
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,091
There's a connection.

3554
01:30:33,091 --> 01:30:34,560
I know that he's been at a lot of fights.

3555
01:30:34,561 --> 01:30:34,801
I know,

3556
01:30:34,801 --> 01:30:35,161
first of all,

3557
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:36,240
I grew up in Boston.

3558
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:37,590
I know that he was a boxer.

3559
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:41,280
I know that he hadn't been nears disease
from a beating that he took one night

3560
01:30:41,281 --> 01:30:42,090
by a bunch of guys.

3561
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:47,090
So I know that he's been in a lot of
fights and there's a direct correlation

3562
01:30:48,061 --> 01:30:51,600
that they've recently established between
people that have a certain type of

3563
01:30:51,601 --> 01:30:54,060
brain damage and compulsive gambling.

3564
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:54,531
Well,

3565
01:30:54,531 --> 01:30:55,820
let's be real candid though,

3566
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:56,840
like Dana,

3567
01:30:56,930 --> 01:31:01,930
the kind of guy that is Dana white is
also the kind of guy that is Charles

3568
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:02,750
Barkley and Michael Jordan.

3569
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:03,583
Michael Jordan,

3570
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:04,650
like these,

3571
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:06,710
it's a guy that made magic happen,

3572
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:09,950
made magic with his life
happening on the paper.

3573
01:31:09,951 --> 01:31:11,840
He was not supposed to
end up already is today.

3574
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:12,560
Okay.

3575
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,393
But he did it.

3576
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:16,100
So there's very different between him
and those two guys because those two guys

3577
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:18,080
were athletes and those
two guys did it with,

3578
01:31:18,081 --> 01:31:18,650
uh,

3579
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:20,510
with natural athletic performances.

3580
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,770
When he did it with,

3581
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,820
he was the perfect guy and the
perfect time to run a business.

3582
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:26,900
That's that crazy.

3583
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:27,410
Yeah.

3584
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:27,741
You know,

3585
01:31:27,741 --> 01:31:29,510
to not try to water it down in any way,

3586
01:31:29,511 --> 01:31:31,470
shape or form to actually embrace the,

3587
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:34,790
the aggressive aspects
of it and exemplify them.

3588
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:35,181
And that's,

3589
01:31:35,181 --> 01:31:35,511
that's a,

3590
01:31:35,511 --> 01:31:37,160
that's a weird thing about who he is.

3591
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:38,930
Cause like no CEOs,

3592
01:31:38,931 --> 01:31:40,190
whatever it behave like him,

3593
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:41,111
the way he behaves,

3594
01:31:41,111 --> 01:31:44,150
he's crazy as fights and people
on Twitter go fuck your mother.

3595
01:31:44,151 --> 01:31:46,550
I mean she's a mad maybe
the slim Jim I told,

3596
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:50,180
I told the president travels handle
she needed to slap slap chop guy.

3597
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:51,043
Is that what you meant?

3598
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:53,710
The snappiness Lindzen
oh that's a rightie.

3599
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:54,141
Macho man.

3600
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:54,860
Savage.

3601
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:55,071
Yeah.

3602
01:31:55,071 --> 01:31:56,840
Maybe he's got a job though.

3603
01:31:57,020 --> 01:32:00,070
See Dana bridges the gap between being a

3604
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,810
man's man and being a businessman.

3605
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:03,460
Like he knows how to do business as well,

3606
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:05,050
but he doesn't give a fuck,

3607
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:05,711
you know?

3608
01:32:05,711 --> 01:32:07,330
And now that he's got a lot of money,

3609
01:32:07,331 --> 01:32:08,500
it gives even less of a fuck.

3610
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,710
I told the president of travel channel
at dinner that night that she needed to

3611
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:15,670
run Twitter just like
Dana White and be like,

3612
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,130
I dunno about this
fucking Adam Richmond guy.

3613
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:18,964
What do you guys think?

3614
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:23,800
It doesn't really run it like fucking
Dana white like big bird guides.

3615
01:32:23,801 --> 01:32:24,631
And she really is.

3616
01:32:24,631 --> 01:32:25,130
I go,

3617
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:29,130
who'd be so fucking funny you should
do is offer right at four and say,

3618
01:32:29,131 --> 01:32:29,431
listen,

3619
01:32:29,431 --> 01:32:30,720
I try and manage your life.

3620
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:33,150
They said no fucking way.

3621
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,141
I was like,

3622
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:38,010
let me run travel channel.com for like
for like the Twitter handle for one day,

3623
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,360
one hour for one day.

3624
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:39,631
We'll,

3625
01:32:39,631 --> 01:32:39,901
we'll,

3626
01:32:39,901 --> 01:32:42,390
we'll come on the podcast and
promote it and we'll just attack.

3627
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:43,230
All right everybody,

3628
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:43,910
everybody,

3629
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:44,743
this is what we,

3630
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:45,510
okay.

3631
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:46,980
Tweet Nisha.

3632
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:47,851
Spell it.

3633
01:32:47,851 --> 01:32:48,210
She's,

3634
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:49,470
she's the one who uh,

3635
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:50,910
who runs travel channel.

3636
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,200
I maybe I shouldn't say that,

3637
01:32:52,201 --> 01:32:54,660
but it demand Rachael Ray nip slips.

3638
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:55,610
No,

3639
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:58,090
Nisha create those with,

3640
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:58,970
with digital.

3641
01:32:58,971 --> 01:33:01,010
That'll be one of the
first scandals when an act,

3642
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:04,550
an act actress accidentally
has a nip slip and she goes,

3643
01:33:04,551 --> 01:33:05,640
that never fucking happened.

3644
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:06,060
Like,

3645
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,690
oh well we've kind of on filming.

3646
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,470
So unfortunate.

3647
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:12,440
And it turns out some creepy
editor faked in and nip slip

3648
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,180
tweet at n.

3649
01:33:14,181 --> 01:33:17,570
I.

3650
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:17,570
S h.

3651
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:17,570
A.

3652
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:17,570
C.

3653
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:17,570
H.

3654
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:17,690
I.

3655
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:17,931
T.

3656
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:18,380
T.

3657
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:18,650
A.

3658
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:19,483
L.

3659
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:20,360
She is,

3660
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:20,600
uh,

3661
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,130
she's my,

3662
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:21,531
she was like,

3663
01:33:21,531 --> 01:33:25,100
does all the media for travel channel
through the Internet and tell her that I

3664
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:26,660
should run travel channels.

3665
01:33:26,661 --> 01:33:27,680
Twitter for one day.

3666
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:29,030
There's a,

3667
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:29,660
she's on,

3668
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:30,770
she's on the fence about it.

3669
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,420
So if everyone tweets
or then she'll be like,

3670
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:32,991
oh fuck,

3671
01:33:32,991 --> 01:33:33,380
there's a,

3672
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,280
maybe this will be fun,

3673
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:35,550
chartered and neither of you,

3674
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,280
it's never gonna happen.

3675
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,530
Let it go because she's not going to want
you to go through her all her private

3676
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:42,350
messages and see like her
sporting network travel channel.

3677
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:43,363
It's not hers.

3678
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:44,420
It's not gonna give me hers.

3679
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:46,460
Welcome to Burt's courts.com.

3680
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,230
Thank you for signing up
for your membership guys.

3681
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:54,440
You get one damp Bert cleanup cloth.

3682
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:56,480
No one email or no one tweeter.

3683
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:59,270
This is a bad idea guys.

3684
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,140
Come on.

3685
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,280
I'm a professional man.

3686
01:34:01,281 --> 01:34:02,940
Can't have put it back in the box.

3687
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:07,580
The box.com can't have it both ways.

3688
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:09,040
God,

3689
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,430
I should've never get lettered Twitter.

3690
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:13,160
I noticed something weird about
Vancouver when we were up there.

3691
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:13,970
I was,

3692
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:17,720
there was so many Chinese people there
cause we got the story of Asians people.

3693
01:34:17,721 --> 01:34:18,554
Period.

3694
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,240
Did you ever go to that museum up there?

3695
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:20,900
No,

3696
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,090
but the driver was telling us about how,

3697
01:34:23,091 --> 01:34:23,331
you know,

3698
01:34:23,331 --> 01:34:26,030
they all moved up there like all these
really rich Chinese people that come up

3699
01:34:26,031 --> 01:34:28,270
with in the fifties or sixties well yeah,

3700
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:32,140
miss of complicated immigration
story probably wouldn't,

3701
01:34:32,141 --> 01:34:33,640
shouldn't simplify it like that.

3702
01:34:33,641 --> 01:34:36,340
There's actually a whole
library we can go a I went with,

3703
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:38,410
I think I was already maybe Dunkin,

3704
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:39,880
I forget who else was up there with me.

3705
01:34:39,881 --> 01:34:42,010
We're working but we went to this uh,

3706
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,390
immigration library.

3707
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:46,180
This a Chinese or a museum rather.

3708
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,520
There's a Chinese like immigration museum.

3709
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,430
It was pretty interesting.

3710
01:34:49,431 --> 01:34:51,190
Like just the history of Vancouver.

3711
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:53,470
That's bad ass fucking town man.

3712
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,200
Well I was trying to theirs,

3713
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:56,203
it was so,

3714
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:58,050
so much beautiful women
because there's so many

3715
01:34:58,230 --> 01:35:01,860
Asian girls and stuff out there and I
tried to find a massage parlor and I went

3716
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:02,910
like three hours,

3717
01:35:02,911 --> 01:35:04,350
like walking around
and trying to find one.

3718
01:35:04,710 --> 01:35:06,210
There was not one anywhere near there.

3719
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:07,730
Then I notice like the strip clubs,

3720
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:08,100
like,

3721
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,950
like they had really weird things
going on with the strip clubs.

3722
01:35:10,951 --> 01:35:13,020
Like you can't touch the girls are

3723
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,520
but on people.

3724
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,091
Well,

3725
01:35:17,091 --> 01:35:18,660
I'm just saying and then I went to,

3726
01:35:18,661 --> 01:35:18,980
uh,

3727
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:21,770
look for boner pills because
I like to take it on stage.

3728
01:35:21,771 --> 01:35:25,010
When I had to do this bit about boner
pills and like show people and stuff,

3729
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,960
I went to maybe five,

3730
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:27,291
seven,

3731
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:29,210
11 is like every single little market.

3732
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:30,560
Finally I just went to the guy,

3733
01:35:30,561 --> 01:35:30,771
I'm like,

3734
01:35:30,771 --> 01:35:30,981
look,

3735
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:31,551
I'm a comic.

3736
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:32,200
They have these things.

3737
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,270
I explained it to him,

3738
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:33,820
uh,

3739
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:33,981
uh,

3740
01:35:33,981 --> 01:35:35,420
of this convenience store and he goes,

3741
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:36,141
no way,

3742
01:35:36,141 --> 01:35:36,381
dude.

3743
01:35:36,381 --> 01:35:38,390
They don't sell that shit here in Canada.

3744
01:35:38,391 --> 01:35:42,620
And I would just seem like Canada's
seemed really a censored in some ways.

3745
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,633
And then that's fine.

3746
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,533
Boner pills,

3747
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:45,160
right.

3748
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:45,760
I came in,

3749
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,270
I didn't find any jerk off haulers and uh,

3750
01:35:48,271 --> 01:35:49,200
there was no boner pills.

3751
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:50,190
What a bullshit country.

3752
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,260
The whole country basically is bullshit.

3753
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,143
The city,

3754
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:56,700
the city of Vancouver seems
you were in a really weird,

3755
01:35:56,730 --> 01:35:58,410
you were in an unusual area.

3756
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:58,771
Okay.

3757
01:35:58,771 --> 01:36:01,050
You were in a very nice area
and a very specific area.

3758
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:03,000
I mean to say that that's the whole area.

3759
01:36:03,001 --> 01:36:03,990
That's a whole town.

3760
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:04,921
It's kind of silly.

3761
01:36:04,921 --> 01:36:09,921
You saw a small part and mostly a high
traffic business and tourist destination

3762
01:36:10,411 --> 01:36:11,244
as well.

3763
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:12,090
You know,

3764
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:15,260
just because they don't that those
fucking pills are not good for you man.

3765
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:19,210
You think it's okay to just throw back
these fucking boner pills every week and

3766
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:20,970
not have any problems they,

3767
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,100
they're not necessarily good for you man.

3768
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:24,211
What are you doing Brian?

3769
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:24,551
You at?

3770
01:36:24,551 --> 01:36:26,460
You showing off all your heart on pills.

3771
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:27,293
If the gold one,

3772
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:28,790
this is the black ones,

3773
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,193
will you take,

3774
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:33,570
you should get go to a doctor and tell
me Dick's broken and it give you a

3775
01:36:33,571 --> 01:36:35,640
Viagara because that's what that is.

3776
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:36,930
You're eating Viagara you just,

3777
01:36:36,931 --> 01:36:39,900
you're just getting it through
some dick up regularly.

3778
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:40,711
Oh no I can't.

3779
01:36:40,711 --> 01:36:41,460
It's broken.

3780
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:42,293
It's Dick's Bro.

3781
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:43,741
He totally,

3782
01:36:43,741 --> 01:36:44,810
why do you dread wired it?

3783
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:47,340
Because then you have
boners for like days.

3784
01:36:47,341 --> 01:36:47,701
It's fine.

3785
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:48,451
I don't need it for days.

3786
01:36:48,451 --> 01:36:49,590
I need it for like 20 minutes.

3787
01:36:49,591 --> 01:36:52,230
You say it now have you tatted
voter for days it's fine.

3788
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,290
I don't know if I want a boat over days.

3789
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:58,250
But did you see that?

3790
01:36:58,251 --> 01:37:00,650
Like how do you think is Canada?

3791
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:02,550
Do you even realize what you're saying?

3792
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:03,001
Yeah,

3793
01:37:03,001 --> 01:37:03,291
I did.

3794
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:08,270
I couldn't find any boner pills or
powders and you couldn't touch it,

3795
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:09,660
which is normal.

3796
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:11,370
They don't sell the boner pills.

3797
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:12,300
Uh,

3798
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:13,740
and the massage part is like the REC.

3799
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:13,960
Yeah.

3800
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:14,880
Was only like a couple here.

3801
01:37:14,881 --> 01:37:17,250
They're trying to get rid
of them and so in that town,

3802
01:37:17,251 --> 01:37:19,080
but that's because we're saving Coover in,

3803
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,130
in that area.

3804
01:37:20,131 --> 01:37:21,390
That part of town that we were at.

3805
01:37:21,391 --> 01:37:24,980
I mean there's areas where you can go out
where it's like they're very young and

3806
01:37:24,981 --> 01:37:26,100
basically my prostitution.

3807
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:26,611
Yeah.

3808
01:37:26,611 --> 01:37:27,540
But massage parlors,

3809
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:28,510
all of them like,

3810
01:37:28,530 --> 01:37:28,741
well,

3811
01:37:28,741 --> 01:37:29,371
they're trying to keep,

3812
01:37:29,371 --> 01:37:31,050
they try to keep those
things out of nice areas,

3813
01:37:31,051 --> 01:37:31,884
bro.

3814
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:33,960
You can't find one in Beverly Hills.

3815
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:38,580
Go to Beverly Hills and try to
find a place that beats you off.

3816
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:39,031
No,

3817
01:37:39,031 --> 01:37:40,050
I'm not saying a beat up place.

3818
01:37:40,051 --> 01:37:41,790
I'm talking to like legit massage parlors.

3819
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:42,900
Most of those are not legit.

3820
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:44,830
Like if you drive down,

3821
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,620
if you drive down Santa Monica,

3822
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:47,580
pass the four oh five,

3823
01:37:47,581 --> 01:37:48,630
you're going to run into a bunch.

3824
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:49,920
But not that I know,

3825
01:37:49,921 --> 01:37:51,830
but I'm just saying that's what I hear.

3826
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:52,230
Yeah.

3827
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:53,063
But whatever.

3828
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:54,690
These also don't make you come,

3829
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:55,560
Huh?

3830
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,350
These also,

3831
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:56,850
uh,

3832
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:58,170
are for premature ejaculation.

3833
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:58,500
Yeah.

3834
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,340
They totally,

3835
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,100
it's like,

3836
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:00,620
oh no,

3837
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:01,453
what am I done?

3838
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:03,330
You can pound it forever.

3839
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:03,721
Hey,

3840
01:38:03,721 --> 01:38:08,190
did you see that photo that the Australian
dude put took the paraglider took of

3841
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:08,461
a,

3842
01:38:08,461 --> 01:38:08,610
a,

3843
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:10,650
a vortex in Australia?

3844
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,130
Why?

3845
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:11,970
It's on my Twitter.

3846
01:38:11,971 --> 01:38:13,080
You got to see this.

3847
01:38:13,081 --> 01:38:14,040
This is insane.

3848
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:19,350
This guy took this photo
when he was paragliding and
it's one of those things in

3849
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:23,190
those movies that suck ships into it
and brings it down to the bottom of the

3850
01:38:23,191 --> 01:38:23,651
ocean.

3851
01:38:23,651 --> 01:38:24,484
The ocean.

3852
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:24,790
Oh,

3853
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:25,360
shut.

3854
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,790
No more taxes.

3855
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:27,631
Well,

3856
01:38:27,631 --> 01:38:32,400
he got a photo of an actual
vortex and it's fucking beautiful,

3857
01:38:32,401 --> 01:38:32,761
man.

3858
01:38:32,761 --> 01:38:37,761
It's just slightly off shore and he's a
paragliding over it and it looks like a

3859
01:38:38,101 --> 01:38:40,170
hurricane that's happening in the ocean,

3860
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:42,540
like a hurricane that's
happening of water.

3861
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,033
You see a Brian?

3862
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,840
It's the one on the Huffington Post.

3863
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,440
Yes.

3864
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,070
Yeah.

3865
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:47,730
Pull this up.

3866
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:48,361
Check this out,

3867
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:49,140
man.

3868
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:49,310
Bro,

3869
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:49,990
do you read it?

3870
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:52,960
What are you trying to get up to your
Twitter to find that picture so I can

3871
01:38:52,961 --> 01:38:53,794
fucking down.

3872
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:55,103
Look,

3873
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,081
it's up over there.

3874
01:38:56,081 --> 01:38:57,040
You don't have to turn around.

3875
01:38:57,130 --> 01:38:57,970
There's two TVS.

3876
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,450
Just one over that Eiko Fella.

3877
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:03,280
That's beautiful man.

3878
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:04,270
He was on paraglider.

3879
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:05,133
Yeah.

3880
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:06,230
Oh that's scary shit.

3881
01:39:06,610 --> 01:39:08,240
He's gangster cause you just find it.

3882
01:39:08,241 --> 01:39:10,220
Well that you don't know what that
does to the fucking pressure system.

3883
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,110
[inaudible] be so weird.

3884
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:12,721
Well,

3885
01:39:12,721 --> 01:39:12,931
you know,

3886
01:39:12,931 --> 01:39:15,390
that's one of the theories
about the Bermuda triangle.

3887
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:17,790
The Bermuda triangle is
like a legit mystery.

3888
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,230
And one of the,

3889
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:23,790
one of the theories about the Bermuda
triangle is a certain amount of

3890
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:26,370
underground gas getting released.

3891
01:39:26,371 --> 01:39:27,870
I think it's nitrogen.

3892
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:28,783
Oh fuck.

3893
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,790
I forget what the gas it is.

3894
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,410
I shouldn't say whatever the
gas is not as would makes sense.

3895
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:35,730
Cause then that would cut engines.

3896
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:36,900
I think that's what it is.

3897
01:39:36,901 --> 01:39:41,670
And it's under the underground in massive
pockets of like decaying seaweed and

3898
01:39:41,671 --> 01:39:42,504
stuff like that.

3899
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:44,520
And apparently when it bursts,

3900
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:46,140
it goes through the water,

3901
01:39:46,141 --> 01:39:51,141
rises up into the atmosphere and it kills
a plane's ability to fly because it's,

3902
01:39:51,681 --> 01:39:53,610
it's like a big giant cloud.

3903
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:57,690
So these planes nose dive
and then when it hits boats,

3904
01:39:57,870 --> 01:39:59,850
like the nitrogen rich water,

3905
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:00,220
when it hits

3906
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:00,461
both,

3907
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:01,220
they just sink.

3908
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:04,540
I see someone who's obsessed with the
Bermuda triangle when I was a kid,

3909
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:06,820
big foot Bermuda triangle,

3910
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:08,770
fucking horses.

3911
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:12,160
Lat doesn't have anything to do
with each other and precious gems.

3912
01:40:12,161 --> 01:40:14,020
What the fuck those or
do you remember the show?

3913
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:15,770
Do you remember the big flood angel?

3914
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:16,480
I just,

3915
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,510
anything that had like some like through
the member that's figuring and horses

3916
01:40:19,511 --> 01:40:20,020
where they'd be.

3917
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:20,711
Let's talk about this,

3918
01:40:20,711 --> 01:40:23,080
cause I'm going looking for
bigfoot with Dunkin this week.

3919
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:24,140
Are you fucking serious?

3920
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:25,300
We're gone from my new shot.

3921
01:40:25,301 --> 01:40:26,320
We're going looking for bigfoot.

3922
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:27,370
Oh,

3923
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:31,220
we're going into like known
habitat's going happy.

3924
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:31,460
Hilarious.

3925
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:34,510
Do you find them and then it's like all
these years you just needed to go out

3926
01:40:34,511 --> 01:40:37,020
and take three day vacation and find them.

3927
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:38,140
There's something going on,

3928
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:39,290
there's something going on.

3929
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:41,130
Do you know how many pissed
off bigfoot hundreds.

3930
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:42,131
Well this is,

3931
01:40:42,131 --> 01:40:43,210
this is what's going on

3932
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:44,500
with the whole big foot thing.

3933
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:45,191
There's this,

3934
01:40:45,191 --> 01:40:46,390
someone has to decide.

3935
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:50,680
Someone has to investigate what's
going on cause it's even there's this

3936
01:40:50,681 --> 01:40:52,360
possibilities that it's real,

3937
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:54,940
but there's is that everyone
is losing their mind,

3938
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:57,070
including me for going and
looking for this fucking thing.

3939
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:57,371
No,

3940
01:40:57,371 --> 01:40:58,380
I don't think this is,

3941
01:40:58,420 --> 01:40:59,020
this is,

3942
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:01,840
this is what fucking need
to do with their lives.

3943
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:02,230
No.

3944
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:05,560
It could be some sort of a
mass hysteria type thing.

3945
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:06,610
I don't think it is.

3946
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,570
But I think to approach
any unusual suspect,

3947
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:12,010
no matter what you would like it to be.

3948
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,250
Of course I would like to
go there and see big foot.

3949
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,031
Of course.

3950
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:16,511
Of course.

3951
01:41:16,511 --> 01:41:21,420
I would like to go there and get
convincing video and photographs and,

3952
01:41:21,421 --> 01:41:23,470
and sounds of bigfoot of course.

3953
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:26,440
But I've got to really be honest.

3954
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:29,260
There is a possibility it doesn't exist.

3955
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:31,720
And all these people that
have told me it exists,

3956
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:34,420
I have no reason to disbelieve them.

3957
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:36,160
The people that have told
me they've had experiences,

3958
01:41:36,161 --> 01:41:37,390
I have no reason to disbelieve them.

3959
01:41:37,391 --> 01:41:40,630
But I have not had those
experiences myself.

3960
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:45,930
So even if I do believe them and trust
them 100% I still don't 100% know that

3961
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:47,060
it's real.

3962
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:48,520
Are you bringing any technology with you?

3963
01:41:48,521 --> 01:41:48,941
Oh God.

3964
01:41:48,941 --> 01:41:50,410
So you believe in the culinary man.

3965
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:54,040
We're going to look at it
from overhead with a blimp.

3966
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:55,870
Infrared and now we're gonna.

3967
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:58,120
We're gonna figure out a bunch of
different ways when we might go twice.

3968
01:41:58,330 --> 01:42:01,630
We're going to go this time and then
I'm going to try to go in July with Les

3969
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:02,020
Stroud.

3970
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:03,130
I'm going to go back with survivor.

3971
01:42:03,131 --> 01:42:03,401
Man.

3972
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:05,020
We're going to go one and
we're gonna Talk Shit on bear.

3973
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:06,520
Bear Grylls the whole time we're there.

3974
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:10,050
Fucking hotel stamp bitch when
we're out there roughing it with it.

3975
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,860
Sticks up our ass sleeping in tents,

3976
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:15,910
bear Grylls and lounge at
the four seasons slippers on.

3977
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:17,760
Watching pay per view that fuck.

3978
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:18,971
When you were a kid,

3979
01:42:18,971 --> 01:42:19,804
did you watch,

3980
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:20,651
did you watch the show?

3981
01:42:20,651 --> 01:42:23,440
Big Foot in search of with Leonard Nimoy?

3982
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:23,831
Yeah.

3983
01:42:23,831 --> 01:42:24,980
Big Foot and wild boy I to,

3984
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:26,380
I was obsessed with that show.

3985
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,190
You probably got dropped
in your head or something?

3986
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:30,910
I probably do cloth until I
was in a fucking second grade.

3987
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:35,140
Every single day when I got to
play loincloth and moccasins,

3988
01:42:35,410 --> 01:42:38,500
I went camping with my family
when I was probably like

3989
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:42,490
probably 10 ish somewhere around then.

3990
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:43,750
And uh,

3991
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:48,750
we were up in the northern California
area and I ran into a trapper and a guy

3992
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:50,164
like gave me like,

3993
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,320
it was pretty gross and all that,

3994
01:42:51,321 --> 01:42:51,781
thinking about it,

3995
01:42:51,781 --> 01:42:53,590
it gave me like a real rabbit's foot.

3996
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:54,850
It was like a fucking rabbit.

3997
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:55,181
It's,

3998
01:42:55,181 --> 01:42:56,170
it started rotting,

3999
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:56,890
it stunk.

4000
01:42:56,890 --> 01:42:57,723
It was nasty.

4001
01:42:57,970 --> 01:43:00,220
Kept in a paper bag and I
opened the bag and I'm like,

4002
01:43:00,221 --> 01:43:01,390
Jesus Christ,

4003
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:03,010
Bob gimme a bobcat foot.

4004
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,080
It's kind of fucked up when
I think about it because,

4005
01:43:05,410 --> 01:43:05,621
you know,

4006
01:43:05,621 --> 01:43:06,311
the guy was like,

4007
01:43:06,311 --> 01:43:10,030
essentially it was killing these
animals and cutting of skin off.

4008
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:11,470
And that's how he made a living.

4009
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:12,333
And it was really,

4010
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,560
it's really weird if you stop,

4011
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:14,980
I'm thinking drivers are creepy.

4012
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:17,050
It's a weird way to make a living man.

4013
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:18,060
You know,

4014
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:18,181
I,

4015
01:43:18,181 --> 01:43:18,970
and I'm not,

4016
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:19,900
I'm not for it,

4017
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:22,420
but here's the,

4018
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:23,254
here's the thing.

4019
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,270
When you look at like
someone who kills Minx,

4020
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,051
it's like you're,

4021
01:43:26,051 --> 01:43:28,600
you're killing an animal
only for its skin.

4022
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:29,890
You're not really going to eat it.

4023
01:43:29,891 --> 01:43:32,290
It's not like it's a buffalo and
you're going to get both out of it.

4024
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:35,920
You're only actively going
after this animal for its skin.

4025
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:37,300
That's kind of a fucked up thing.

4026
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:39,010
It's a serial killers do that with humans.

4027
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:40,390
It's kind of a fucked up thing.

4028
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:42,730
But what's the thing,

4029
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,080
the other thing to consider is,

4030
01:43:44,081 --> 01:43:44,410
well,

4031
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:45,220
if you don't,

4032
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:45,650
what does,

4033
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:47,650
what's the life expectancy
of these animals?

4034
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:48,820
It's very small.

4035
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:49,803
It's very short.

4036
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:51,830
And if you don't kill them,

4037
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,820
it's very likely that some wolf is going
to come along and kill them or some

4038
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:56,840
coyote or whatever.

4039
01:43:56,841 --> 01:43:58,040
So the real question becomes,

4040
01:43:58,041 --> 01:44:01,040
do you deserve to be the person,

4041
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:02,300
be the,

4042
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:02,661
the,

4043
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:05,600
the being that kills this
for a different desire.

4044
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,010
Your desire is to have it enhance
your artificially created culture,

4045
01:44:10,011 --> 01:44:15,011
life you to take the skin from this
animal and turn it into currency and in

4046
01:44:15,931 --> 01:44:16,290
order to,

4047
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:16,551
you know,

4048
01:44:16,551 --> 01:44:17,750
it's again to help you,

4049
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:19,820
enable you to live like a better life.

4050
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:23,850
Or is it only reserved for wolves?

4051
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:24,713
Deet?

4052
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:27,430
It's so weird little situation because no,

4053
01:44:27,431 --> 01:44:29,840
no fucking minks die of old age,

4054
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:30,491
you know,

4055
01:44:30,491 --> 01:44:31,790
and make it to old age man.

4056
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:32,960
Nobody makes it to old age.

4057
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:34,480
He fuck as much as you can.

4058
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:37,760
You make as many babies as you can and
you gotta be confident in the fact that

4059
01:44:37,761 --> 01:44:42,350
most likely a lot of people you know are
going to get eaten by wolves for your

4060
01:44:42,351 --> 01:44:42,640
mink.

4061
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:44,540
Fear for years is how long it makes Lyft.

4062
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,110
Yeah,

4063
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:50,110
and they make it an either you're not
making it to four and I don't want to be

4064
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:52,130
the one who kills a mink for it's for.

4065
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:55,610
But when you look at the real situation,

4066
01:44:55,640 --> 01:45:00,290
it's not quite as simple as a person
shouldn't be able to do that because

4067
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:03,560
there's people that live in like say
let's go talk about like the people that

4068
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:04,430
live in the taiga,

4069
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:08,960
they live in Siberia and that's how
their family has been making a living for

4070
01:45:08,961 --> 01:45:12,080
generation after generation
because it makes you uncomfortable.

4071
01:45:12,081 --> 01:45:12,381
It should.

4072
01:45:12,381 --> 01:45:16,910
They be forced to stop doing that
because that's like a giant percentage of

4073
01:45:16,911 --> 01:45:17,541
their income.

4074
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:21,740
Like what they use to buy snowmobiles
and what they used to buy tools.

4075
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:26,840
It's like this weird hunting and gathering
culture that lives in Siberia and the

4076
01:45:26,841 --> 01:45:29,540
Taiga forest and these people,

4077
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:30,680
they need those minx.

4078
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:32,810
They need those whatever the
animals that are trapping,

4079
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:34,820
they need those furs and they,

4080
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:36,110
it's not just their family,

4081
01:45:36,111 --> 01:45:39,050
their generation after generation
has been trapping and hunting.

4082
01:45:39,051 --> 01:45:39,290
That's,

4083
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:40,310
that's how they live up there.

4084
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:42,440
So who's to say that they can't do it?

4085
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:43,071
Well,

4086
01:45:43,071 --> 01:45:44,030
if they can do it,

4087
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:45,560
who's buying their first?

4088
01:45:45,561 --> 01:45:48,440
Well people down here behind the people
in Beverly Hills or buying some furs

4089
01:45:48,441 --> 01:45:49,460
that came right out of stripe.

4090
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:50,313
Siberia.

4091
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,340
And that is how those people are,

4092
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:54,350
are able to survive.

4093
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:55,940
So it's a tricky situation.

4094
01:45:56,180 --> 01:46:00,620
It's not quite as simple
to me as a cut and black,

4095
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:01,221
you know,

4096
01:46:01,221 --> 01:46:02,001
black and white.

4097
01:46:02,001 --> 01:46:03,650
You should not be able to do that.

4098
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:08,770
We as a society should stop that because
it's evil and the stealing of fur and

4099
01:46:09,561 --> 01:46:11,480
skin from an animal and
killing it because of that.

4100
01:46:11,481 --> 01:46:13,040
It's really gross and vile.

4101
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,360
And I agree with that.

4102
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:15,740
I completely agree with that.

4103
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,600
But I also realistically
look at the situation and go,

4104
01:46:20,601 --> 01:46:21,110
well these are,

4105
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:21,591
these are not,

4106
01:46:21,591 --> 01:46:22,670
animals are gonna live forever.

4107
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:23,091
You know,

4108
01:46:23,091 --> 01:46:23,510
this is,

4109
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:25,010
this is a weird existence.

4110
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:29,270
This thing has its living in this
frozen Tundra and everywhere it goes,

4111
01:46:29,271 --> 01:46:30,350
something's looking to eat it.

4112
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:31,081
It's like,

4113
01:46:31,081 --> 01:46:33,430
oh listen to you going to want
to fox to eat it or a wolf,

4114
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,790
eat it in two weeks and
then we don't get suffer.

4115
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,400
I watched one of them was,

4116
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:37,970
um,

4117
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:38,803
Hawaii,

4118
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:39,470
Hawaii,

4119
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:41,040
Alaska shows and uh,

4120
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:42,650
they caught a links in a trap.

4121
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:43,430
It's a link.

4122
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:43,851
Oh,

4123
01:46:43,851 --> 01:46:47,810
is that like a black cat to
fucking cat that lives in Alaska?

4124
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:53,170
It's like this crazy looking giant house
cat looking thing with these wild ears.

4125
01:46:54,001 --> 01:46:55,290
It's a nasty animal,

4126
01:46:55,291 --> 01:46:55,530
man.

4127
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:57,190
I don't want to fucking
domesticate one of those.

4128
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:58,201
You don't?

4129
01:46:58,201 --> 01:46:58,890
What are you talking about?

4130
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:01,440
You're on the road all the time and
have that thing live around your kids.

4131
01:47:01,441 --> 01:47:02,250
He crazy.

4132
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:04,710
You never domesticate a wild animal.

4133
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,650
You don't domesticate wild animals.

4134
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:07,890
Oh,

4135
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:08,610
look at that.

4136
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:09,061
Look at that.

4137
01:47:09,061 --> 01:47:09,780
Cool.

4138
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:10,470
Savannah,

4139
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:11,790
have you seen the Savannah cats?

4140
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:12,930
Yeah.

4141
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:13,763
Yeah.

4142
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:14,850
Anna cats.

4143
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:16,840
Things called against Vangol.

4144
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:17,723
What are they called?

4145
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:20,640
It's an her serve all
serve all in the house.

4146
01:47:20,641 --> 01:47:21,474
Cat.

4147
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:22,410
It's a Savannah,

4148
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:23,341
Savannah cat.

4149
01:47:23,341 --> 01:47:24,340
Those are bad ass.

4150
01:47:24,341 --> 01:47:25,230
A buddy who has one,

4151
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:28,500
he says it gives it a chicken
legs and it growls at them.

4152
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:29,480
Shut up.

4153
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,020
He says when he gives a chicken legs,

4154
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,870
it goes wow.

4155
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:37,410
He says it eats it and
makes these crazy amazing

4156
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:41,123
third grader.

4157
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,440
I would not let that
thing hang with my kids.

4158
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:44,850
10 of them in my backyard.

4159
01:47:44,851 --> 01:47:49,320
I live on top of a mountain in Ohio's
fucking cow and they fucking roam outdoors

4160
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:50,910
and rattlesnakes and shit.

4161
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:51,240
What?

4162
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:51,871
I have chickens,

4163
01:47:51,871 --> 01:47:53,580
I mean event chickens
for the last few months.

4164
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:54,570
And uh,

4165
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:57,660
I can let my dogs around the chickens
but I can't let my cat get out.

4166
01:47:58,020 --> 01:47:58,690
And my cat,

4167
01:47:58,690 --> 01:48:01,530
he stands outside the window and
sees the chickens and goes like,

4168
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:02,373
it

4169
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,810
really is a mouse start
shaking cause he's like,

4170
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:11,460
cause his jaw is quivering because all
he's thinking about doing is taking life.

4171
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,920
That's all I can think about is
watch these little chicks tweet,

4172
01:48:13,921 --> 01:48:14,131
tweet,

4173
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:14,371
tweet,

4174
01:48:14,371 --> 01:48:14,611
tweet,

4175
01:48:14,611 --> 01:48:18,720
tweet walking around and he just wants
to bum rush them and just steal on him

4176
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:19,800
and just rip them apart.

4177
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:22,050
And all of his instincts
are just fighting it off.

4178
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:23,850
You can't stop that.

4179
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:26,130
You can't prevent a cat from doing that.

4180
01:48:26,131 --> 01:48:27,690
You can't train it out of them,

4181
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:28,441
but you can't.

4182
01:48:28,441 --> 01:48:30,210
A dog like my massive,

4183
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:32,010
I'm sure he would want
to kill those things,

4184
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:33,480
but I show him,

4185
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:34,000
I'm like,

4186
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:34,410
Hey,

4187
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:35,310
easy,

4188
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:37,710
easy buddy and his tails wag.

4189
01:48:37,711 --> 01:48:38,011
And he's like,

4190
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:39,120
okay so don't kill him.

4191
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:39,401
Go,

4192
01:48:39,401 --> 01:48:40,234
go kill him.

4193
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:41,940
And I totally trust him.

4194
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:47,070
I don't trust my cat or cats at that cow
with Venetia and that fucking bad ass.

4195
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:48,840
You know those things are unpredictable,

4196
01:48:48,841 --> 01:48:49,290
man.

4197
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:49,710
I don't,

4198
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:52,560
I don't know what the behavior
patterns of those things are,

4199
01:48:52,561 --> 01:48:56,370
but I've got to think that it's a bad
idea to bring in a half a wild anything.

4200
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:58,230
I have a friend of mine's huskies.

4201
01:48:58,490 --> 01:48:58,960
I have a friend.

4202
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,121
No,

4203
01:48:59,121 --> 01:48:59,191
no,

4204
01:48:59,191 --> 01:48:59,311
no.

4205
01:48:59,311 --> 01:49:00,450
Husky is a breed.

4206
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:03,540
The big difference between
a Husky looks like a wolf.

4207
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:04,410
It's a breed.

4208
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:08,490
But I have a friend that has
three seven eighth Timberwolves.

4209
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:09,840
Seven eighth.

4210
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:10,261
Yes,

4211
01:49:10,261 --> 01:49:13,230
there's seven ace Timberwolf
and one [inaudible].

4212
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:14,280
No,

4213
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:18,660
he does not have kids but
he's got a weird situation,

4214
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:19,171
you know.

4215
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:19,771
And I told them,

4216
01:49:19,771 --> 01:49:20,131
I'm like,

4217
01:49:20,131 --> 01:49:20,311
dude,

4218
01:49:20,311 --> 01:49:22,770
you're barely in control
of this household.

4219
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:26,970
Like he's got a big male and the
big male is totally dominant.

4220
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,571
The big male.

4221
01:49:27,571 --> 01:49:31,800
In fact God out once it killed his
neighbor sheep like you had like a,

4222
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:33,480
it's got a wolf.

4223
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:34,500
He lives with a wolf.

4224
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:37,140
He's one thunder storm away
from a fucking coup d'etat.

4225
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:38,243
Exactly.

4226
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:43,320
I'm not cool with one Zombie apocalypse.

4227
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:44,760
Zombies will never get to him.

4228
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:46,770
Cause the wolves will eat him
as soon as they go hungry.

4229
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:48,170
As long as they run out of canned

4230
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,470
dog food and dry food
and you can't go outside,

4231
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:51,790
the wolves are going
to look at them and go,

4232
01:49:51,791 --> 01:49:52,091
okay,

4233
01:49:52,091 --> 01:49:52,271
yeah,

4234
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:53,350
you can't take care of us anymore,

4235
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:53,890
bitch.

4236
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:55,000
This agreement that we have,

4237
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:55,301
yeah,

4238
01:49:55,301 --> 01:49:56,320
we're going to have to let that go.

4239
01:49:56,650 --> 01:49:58,270
He's got a 200 pound both in his house.

4240
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,940
200 pounds is a big fucking animal.

4241
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:01,803
It's enormous.

4242
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:02,410
Do Art.

4243
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:05,860
Priscilla's 130 pounds and I
imagine it might not be 200 pounds.

4244
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:08,280
It's at least one 50 it.

4245
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,660
It's a giant monster.

4246
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:13,740
My my massive is one 40 and it was way
bigger than my mastiff is way bigger,

4247
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:14,590
way taller.

4248
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:15,550
It's a big animal.

4249
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:17,230
Like I remember coming over
his house and was like,

4250
01:50:17,231 --> 01:50:17,411
dude,

4251
01:50:17,411 --> 01:50:18,430
this is ridiculous.

4252
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:21,760
Like you got a weird situation here
and like when you make this noise,

4253
01:50:21,761 --> 01:50:22,450
you go like this.

4254
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:23,590
Whew.

4255
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:24,453
The dogs would go,

4256
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,380
they would start howling
and you realize right away,

4257
01:50:29,381 --> 01:50:30,670
these are not dogs,

4258
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:31,030
man.

4259
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:32,480
They look a little like dog.

4260
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,950
You don't have dogs.

4261
01:50:33,951 --> 01:50:35,980
You got fucking wild
animals in your house.

4262
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:38,020
It is amazing that we
have domain over them.

4263
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:39,760
He barely had domain.

4264
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:40,391
Let me tell you something.

4265
01:50:40,391 --> 01:50:43,270
This dude is barely keeping it
together and he would like I said,

4266
01:50:43,271 --> 01:50:44,210
like the got out and they,

4267
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:46,570
they killed a number of sheep.

4268
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:48,250
It was yes.

4269
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:51,360
It wasn't like he killed one
cheap and was satisfied and it,

4270
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:51,581
no,

4271
01:50:51,581 --> 01:50:53,770
he went on a murderous,

4272
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:54,890
exactly.

4273
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:56,200
I'm murderer list salt.

4274
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:56,920
Yeah.

4275
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:57,970
That was a reality show.

4276
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,610
It was a neighbor's
ranch and the neighbor,

4277
01:51:00,611 --> 01:51:00,881
you know,

4278
01:51:00,881 --> 01:51:04,630
it was furious and came over and
he denied it and the whole thing,

4279
01:51:04,631 --> 01:51:04,811
you know,

4280
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:05,820
you got to protect his dog's name.

4281
01:51:05,821 --> 01:51:10,270
Neighbor came over to the shore fucking
shotgun and he's kind of a con for not

4282
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:10,960
telling the truth.

4283
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:11,081
I mean,

4284
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:12,010
you got to man up.

4285
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:14,590
You want to be a bad ass
and have a fucking pet wolf.

4286
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:14,891
Well,

4287
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:16,640
when the wolf kills 18 sheep,

4288
01:51:16,690 --> 01:51:17,620
whatever the hell it did,

4289
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:20,110
can he just go with it was
eight or 18 one of those.

4290
01:51:20,111 --> 01:51:21,310
Either one is equally impressive.

4291
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:22,630
Let's take it once you've killed eight.

4292
01:51:22,631 --> 01:51:23,520
Let's go with eight.

4293
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:26,580
Eight to fucking think about how much
time it takes to kill eight things with

4294
01:51:26,581 --> 01:51:27,414
your face.

4295
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,880
Just run around jacket eight sheet.

4296
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:33,170
It's ripping throat.

4297
01:51:33,171 --> 01:51:34,004
That will

4298
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:37,330
kill one cheap with your face.

4299
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:38,200
No,

4300
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,033
no.

4301
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:39,730
A lot of work.

4302
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:40,750
I could pretend to kill it.

4303
01:51:40,751 --> 01:51:41,584
My face.

4304
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:45,430
I'd have it in a rear naked and then I
would like go sideways and pretend to be

4305
01:51:45,431 --> 01:51:46,211
biting the juggler,

4306
01:51:46,211 --> 01:51:46,571
but real,

4307
01:51:46,571 --> 01:51:48,500
I'd kill it with a rear naked start.

4308
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,950
The time he could get around it.

4309
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:53,350
You could get around a
sheep's neck and put it out.

4310
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:53,710
You get,

4311
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:54,820
but the thing is not going to struggle.

4312
01:51:54,821 --> 01:51:56,050
It just doesn't until it starts.

4313
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:57,250
Once you have your hooks in,

4314
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:57,941
it doesn't matter.

4315
01:51:57,941 --> 01:51:58,930
Our struggle all day.

4316
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,190
Do you have your hooks in?

4317
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:01,210
It's not going anywhere.

4318
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:02,530
Fucking sheep doesn't know.

4319
01:52:02,531 --> 01:52:03,364
No defense.

4320
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:05,620
Sheep doesn't even have any hands.

4321
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,240
She'd can't go two on one.

4322
01:52:07,241 --> 01:52:09,310
She can't get us an arm bar.

4323
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,583
It's going out.

4324
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:12,603
It's going out.

4325
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:14,320
Fucking sheep's going out.

4326
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:16,380
They were talking,

4327
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:16,931
they were talking about,

4328
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:21,931
I was watching something where someone
got caught in an exotic pet fighting

4329
01:52:22,271 --> 01:52:22,481
ring.

4330
01:52:22,481 --> 01:52:24,880
It's a new show on to new shows on TV.

4331
01:52:24,881 --> 01:52:26,260
I just saw the promo for it,

4332
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:26,950
Exxon.

4333
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:28,610
It's called Tarzan.

4334
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:29,573
Oh,

4335
01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:31,180
fucking stupid name.

4336
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:31,870
Tarzan.

4337
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:34,750
Don't they know there's a whole book
and movie series with that same name?

4338
01:52:34,751 --> 01:52:35,920
You confuse the shit out of people,

4339
01:52:35,921 --> 01:52:36,970
but can you see if you can find that?

4340
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,090
It's not like our tone and
the talk show host goes in.

4341
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:43,990
I mean that was his fucking name.

4342
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:44,801
Okay.

4343
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:45,950
The guy's name is Tarzan.

4344
01:52:45,951 --> 01:52:46,740
Fuck that guy.

4345
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:47,121
They were like,

4346
01:52:47,121 --> 01:52:50,600
he goes in and he finds an exotic
pet fighting ring and I'm like,

4347
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:51,291
if he found that,

4348
01:52:51,291 --> 01:52:51,931
we would have heard about,

4349
01:52:51,931 --> 01:52:52,510
but that by now,

4350
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:53,600
not necessarily.

4351
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:55,160
It could have been a [inaudible] ring.

4352
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:56,900
No,

4353
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:57,531
Jesus Christ.

4354
01:52:57,531 --> 01:52:58,364
That's a city.

4355
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:01,370
I think it's an also the problem is
that like they could have created that

4356
01:53:01,371 --> 01:53:03,770
themselves just to make
a TV show about it.

4357
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,330
That's super possible.

4358
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:06,770
Some of those shows I'm like,

4359
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:07,730
fucking seriously,

4360
01:53:07,790 --> 01:53:08,670
how do we have clean audio?

4361
01:53:08,671 --> 01:53:09,141
I want to do that.

4362
01:53:09,141 --> 01:53:10,170
Just walked up to Obar.

4363
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:12,720
Yeah.

4364
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:13,670
Hopefully I go,

4365
01:53:13,671 --> 01:53:13,881
look,

4366
01:53:13,881 --> 01:53:16,070
we've do shows where we're all
miked and we don't get clean audio.

4367
01:53:16,330 --> 01:53:16,820
Like,

4368
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:20,990
I can't believe that we're going to in
mystery diners that we have guide that's

4369
01:53:20,991 --> 01:53:24,110
eating a sandwich that was rubbed on
the girl's tit and we got clean audio on

4370
01:53:24,111 --> 01:53:24,201
them.

4371
01:53:24,201 --> 01:53:25,070
Where's the fucking mic?

4372
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:26,600
Where's the mic thrown on the table?

4373
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:28,820
I don't buy it as a lot of that.

4374
01:53:28,821 --> 01:53:30,200
A lot of fuckery isn't foot.

4375
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:33,280
What does that guy or
that girl rescues parents.

4376
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,750
As long as you don't take that parrot
outside your house on your shoulder

4377
01:53:38,751 --> 01:53:39,800
because if you do,

4378
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:40,750
you're an asshole.

4379
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:41,583
Urban Tarzan's.

4380
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:43,370
Is it urban towards hassle,

4381
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:45,860
trying to take something out of Twitter.

4382
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:47,083
No more.

4383
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:48,320
S.

4384
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:48,320
M.

4385
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:48,350
H.

4386
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:48,680
What was it?

4387
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:48,951
No more.

4388
01:53:48,951 --> 01:53:49,880
Shut my head.

4389
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:50,990
Stop.

4390
01:53:51,470 --> 01:53:55,450
What was the stop and you don't
think that Jesus was the person.

4391
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:56,420
Say Yourself.

4392
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,650
Smh,

4393
01:53:58,640 --> 01:53:59,660
SMH.

4394
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:02,570
Shake my head.

4395
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:03,920
I can't believe it.

4396
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:08,240
And it's almost
universally used by idiots.

4397
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:09,920
Put SMH,

4398
01:54:09,921 --> 01:54:11,150
especially men.

4399
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:12,740
You're a grown man.

4400
01:54:12,741 --> 01:54:15,440
You put s m h at the end of your tweet.

4401
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:22,540
I hope that kills your boner for a
month while you just rethink your life.

4402
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:23,960
S M,

4403
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:24,251
a.

4404
01:54:24,251 --> 01:54:25,420
H you fucks.

4405
01:54:25,470 --> 01:54:26,800
I look at this website for that.

4406
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:28,730
That show that Bert
was talking about like,

4407
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:30,190
look,

4408
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:31,670
this locked into cars truck.

4409
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:32,480
Yeah,

4410
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:32,661
look,

4411
01:54:32,661 --> 01:54:33,830
it's a bobcat dude.

4412
01:54:33,831 --> 01:54:36,950
You do not want to fuck with the movies
have taken over what star and the

4413
01:54:36,951 --> 01:54:38,780
enquirer wants where those are.

4414
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:41,540
They now create programming that is,

4415
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:47,110
the guy's got allotted as fuck and it's
like a bobcat was caught in the trunk.

4416
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:49,580
It's was just one step away from aliens.

4417
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:50,870
Got My daughter pregnant.

4418
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:51,351
Well,

4419
01:54:51,351 --> 01:54:52,580
I think that it's just,

4420
01:54:52,581 --> 01:54:53,420
there's money in it.

4421
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:56,000
And as soon as there's
money in creating fake TV,

4422
01:54:56,030 --> 01:54:57,020
people let go.

4423
01:54:57,021 --> 01:54:57,231
Well,

4424
01:54:57,231 --> 01:54:57,711
wait a minute,

4425
01:54:57,711 --> 01:54:58,970
it's okay to make a sitcom,

4426
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:02,300
but it's not okay to take a bunch of
people that actually do work in an auto

4427
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:05,950
garage and make a bunch of fake scenarios
and they actually tried half and a

4428
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:06,783
half unique person.

4429
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,330
But why does it drive you nuts?

4430
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:08,631
Okay.

4431
01:55:08,631 --> 01:55:11,990
Because it's not mean if once
you establish what it is,

4432
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:13,550
it's just a show.

4433
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:14,623
Because,

4434
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:15,080
um,

4435
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:18,440
well I'll say this from my perspective.

4436
01:55:18,441 --> 01:55:19,520
I watched duck dynasty,

4437
01:55:19,521 --> 01:55:20,354
the people that,

4438
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:21,673
first of all,

4439
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,300
how fucking dare you,

4440
01:55:24,470 --> 01:55:24,861
what?

4441
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:26,310
You're a standup comedian.

4442
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:27,350
Do you have a wife,

4443
01:55:27,351 --> 01:55:28,400
you have children,

4444
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:31,670
you have things to do and
you're watching duck dynasty.

4445
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:36,230
I got 40 minutes of my
life digit shit away.

4446
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:39,620
I was on the road,

4447
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:40,490
I was on the road,

4448
01:55:40,491 --> 01:55:40,881
whatever.

4449
01:55:40,881 --> 01:55:41,960
Write a joke bitch.

4450
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:44,680
And I'm watching it by weight.

4451
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:48,840
Completely hypocritical and guilty as
charged and watch duck dynasty all the

4452
01:55:48,841 --> 01:55:49,210
time.

4453
01:55:49,210 --> 01:55:49,751
Someone told me,

4454
01:55:49,751 --> 01:55:49,961
they're like,

4455
01:55:49,961 --> 01:55:50,621
you gotta watch it.

4456
01:55:50,621 --> 01:55:50,890
It's,

4457
01:55:50,890 --> 01:55:52,980
it gets me like network numbers.

4458
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:56,020
It's not good.

4459
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:57,130
It's,

4460
01:55:57,130 --> 01:55:57,963
here's my thing.

4461
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:02,860
I don't mind a fake reality show if
it's a nod to a fake reality show,

4462
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:05,080
but the fact that you're
trying to fool me,

4463
01:56:05,170 --> 01:56:06,070
pisses me off.

4464
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:08,890
And what sucks is distinctly on trip flip.

4465
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:13,570
I have fought like tooth and nail to
make sure that all our crashes are real,

4466
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:15,070
but they look fake as fuck.

4467
01:56:15,071 --> 01:56:15,904
When I watched them,

4468
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:16,481
I go,

4469
01:56:16,481 --> 01:56:18,070
that doesn't look like
we really crashed it,

4470
01:56:18,071 --> 01:56:18,551
but we really,

4471
01:56:18,551 --> 01:56:20,170
I'm standing on the street
corner just like a real person.

4472
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:22,270
But then you want to duck dynasty
and people are willing to go,

4473
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:24,100
guys,

4474
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:25,570
I was thinking we'd all go to Hawaii.

4475
01:56:25,571 --> 01:56:25,751
Well,

4476
01:56:25,751 --> 01:56:26,021
Hey,

4477
01:56:26,021 --> 01:56:27,820
I don't even want to go to Hawaii.

4478
01:56:27,821 --> 01:56:27,971
Well,

4479
01:56:27,971 --> 01:56:28,810
what are we going to do?

4480
01:56:28,811 --> 01:56:29,411
Don't worry.

4481
01:56:29,411 --> 01:56:30,520
I'll plan it all.

4482
01:56:30,521 --> 01:56:31,840
And then he watches it
blowing in your face.

4483
01:56:31,990 --> 01:56:32,960
It's Sitcom writing.

4484
01:56:33,310 --> 01:56:35,980
That's why Dunkin refuse to go on.

4485
01:56:35,981 --> 01:56:36,280
Uh,

4486
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:38,260
the minding the store reality show.

4487
01:56:38,261 --> 01:56:42,100
Like he knew they were going to make
him do something along those lines.

4488
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:43,110
And uh,

4489
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:43,631
he was like,

4490
01:56:43,631 --> 01:56:43,960
yeah,

4491
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:44,620
you know what?

4492
01:56:44,620 --> 01:56:46,450
I would rather not be on TV.

4493
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:46,931
Boom.

4494
01:56:46,931 --> 01:56:48,100
This is what I'm looking for this week.

4495
01:56:48,101 --> 01:56:50,140
Bert Kreischer I'm looking for Sasquatch.

4496
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:50,381
Oh,

4497
01:56:50,381 --> 01:56:52,170
I could go on squatch and sign me.

4498
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:52,561
I can do it.

4499
01:56:52,561 --> 01:56:53,410
Trust five foot nine,

4500
01:56:53,411 --> 01:56:54,070
one of those,

4501
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:56,130
me and Duncan Trussell or squatch.

4502
01:56:56,131 --> 01:56:57,010
That's fucking great.

4503
01:56:57,011 --> 01:56:58,470
We're going out paired again,

4504
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:03,480
go daily board or be prepared to
maybe make medical science history.

4505
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:05,980
Maybe bring some mushrooms or something.

4506
01:57:05,981 --> 01:57:06,520
They actually,

4507
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,590
bigfoot needed with someone
like me to come along.

4508
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:12,070
Maybe bigfoot is tired of
these fucking dorks out there.

4509
01:57:12,071 --> 01:57:15,820
Wander around these unfuckable dorks baby.

4510
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:17,650
The big foot needs someone to talk to.

4511
01:57:17,950 --> 01:57:18,790
Maybe bigfoot was like,

4512
01:57:18,791 --> 01:57:19,061
man,

4513
01:57:19,061 --> 01:57:19,451
listen,

4514
01:57:19,451 --> 01:57:20,920
I was kind of reveal myself,

4515
01:57:20,921 --> 01:57:25,921
but these guys are douchebags to the
route here with fucking wooden beads on.

4516
01:57:26,081 --> 01:57:28,270
And you know what the best thing
about the show is going to be jail.

4517
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,760
You don't listen in to Bert
Kreischer talk our guests.

4518
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:31,200
No.

4519
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:31,910
No,

4520
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:33,280
you have to say is more important.

4521
01:57:33,310 --> 01:57:34,870
How dare you go ahead Brian.

4522
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:40,130
You know what the best part of the show
is going to be is that like if you take

4523
01:57:40,250 --> 01:57:44,120
t takes Tom's girl to go hunt for loch
ness monster and scuba gear and he's got

4524
01:57:44,121 --> 01:57:44,720
audio,

4525
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:47,390
he's going to skate scared as
shit cause he's a regular person.

4526
01:57:47,630 --> 01:57:49,220
That's going to be fucking awesome.

4527
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:49,561
Yeah,

4528
01:57:49,561 --> 01:57:50,890
but what's not going to be awesome?

4529
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:52,230
We're not going to find the fucking lock.

4530
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:54,120
Does it matter?

4531
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:55,710
What would you like to go on?

4532
01:57:55,711 --> 01:57:58,380
If you could pack one
thing I actually like,

4533
01:57:58,381 --> 01:58:00,700
I don't think anyone really believes
that there is a big scraped.

4534
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:01,450
Right.

4535
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:04,950
But what do you think is most likely
if I gave you a couple scenarios?

4536
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:05,800
Big Squirting.

4537
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:06,633
No,

4538
01:58:07,830 --> 01:58:08,670
that's not a good one.

4539
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:09,450
Okay.

4540
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:11,350
Not even remotely feel much macabre.

4541
01:58:11,410 --> 01:58:12,630
You if you had to choose,

4542
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:14,010
if you had a possibility,

4543
01:58:14,011 --> 01:58:15,130
would it be sick,

4544
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:16,080
toxic,

4545
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:16,230
uh,

4546
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:17,063
in Japan.

4547
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:17,530
Oh,

4548
01:58:17,530 --> 01:58:17,881
okay.

4549
01:58:17,881 --> 01:58:18,541
Nuclear waste.

4550
01:58:18,541 --> 01:58:19,291
But that's another way.

4551
01:58:19,291 --> 01:58:20,340
That's not a question.

4552
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:21,170
Yeah,

4553
01:58:21,170 --> 01:58:21,750
that's,

4554
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:22,291
yeah,

4555
01:58:22,291 --> 01:58:23,310
that's a real issue.

4556
01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:24,180
Yeah.

4557
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:24,810
People that have,

4558
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:25,710
they're in Japan.

4559
01:58:25,711 --> 01:58:26,320
That's it.

4560
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,140
If you've ever seen those
Geiger counter videos.

4561
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:29,280
Yeah.

4562
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:32,910
Really fascinating stuff because there's
a completely different rating reading

4563
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:36,030
when you have it and you're holding it
up in the air as opposed to when you put

4564
01:58:36,031 --> 01:58:36,721
it down on the ground,

4565
01:58:36,721 --> 01:58:37,650
when it touches the ground,

4566
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:41,800
like they show like safe levels in the
air and they touch down in the ground and

4567
01:58:41,801 --> 01:58:42,040
this

4568
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,480
one guy on his Geiger counter,

4569
01:58:43,481 --> 01:58:44,291
it's gone off,

4570
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:44,890
man.

4571
01:58:44,890 --> 01:58:49,000
It's like reaching these like really
dangerous levels and all these fucking

4572
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:49,840
people are living there.

4573
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:51,650
Have you seen the Google maps?

4574
01:58:51,651 --> 01:58:52,484
Uh,

4575
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,030
like they just sent a car through
it that the driving thing.

4576
01:58:56,031 --> 01:59:00,630
So now you can go on maps.google.com and
you can do just like dry or do the the,

4577
01:59:00,631 --> 01:59:01,161
the map,

4578
01:59:01,161 --> 01:59:05,210
the moving map thing and look at all the
abandoned houses and all the stores are

4579
01:59:05,211 --> 01:59:06,340
just like a ghost town.

4580
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:07,183
It's really true.

4581
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:10,760
Have you seen the videos where
they show the street like,

4582
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:15,770
like moving and breaking up where
the ocean is underneath the street?

4583
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:16,311
No.

4584
01:59:16,311 --> 01:59:16,670
It's like,

4585
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:17,870
oh my God,

4586
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:18,470
what's this?

4587
01:59:18,470 --> 01:59:21,290
After the tsunami they changed the,

4588
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:22,220
the whole,

4589
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:22,531
the,

4590
01:59:22,531 --> 01:59:27,531
the like the topography and the streets
have a real issue with like giving and

4591
01:59:28,941 --> 01:59:33,260
they move back and forth and
water comes out of cracks.

4592
01:59:33,710 --> 01:59:37,130
Like it still looks like streets
and there's stills houses on it.

4593
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:38,180
But it is,

4594
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:39,820
it's a movable things.

4595
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:41,510
You have the,

4596
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:42,373
you have,

4597
01:59:42,430 --> 01:59:45,580
you're the one of the few people in the
world that I know that has a list of the

4598
01:59:45,581 --> 01:59:48,190
most amazing things you've
ever seen on the Internet.

4599
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,320
You should do a show like toss point.

4600
01:59:50,321 --> 01:59:50,471
Oh,

4601
01:59:50,471 --> 01:59:52,570
but instead of showing people
falling and getting hurt,

4602
01:59:52,571 --> 01:59:53,470
just fucking shit.

4603
01:59:53,471 --> 01:59:54,161
That's awesome.

4604
01:59:54,161 --> 01:59:55,090
That you found on the Internet.

4605
01:59:55,390 --> 01:59:56,350
Wouldn't be hard to do.

4606
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:56,891
I'd fuck it.

4607
01:59:56,891 --> 01:59:58,330
Like every time you tweet something like,

4608
01:59:58,331 --> 01:59:59,081
has anyone seen this?

4609
01:59:59,081 --> 01:59:59,330
I'm like,

4610
01:59:59,330 --> 02:00:00,490
I was going to be fucking awesome.

4611
02:00:00,570 --> 02:00:00,691
Well,

4612
02:00:00,691 --> 02:00:04,050
one of the things about me retweeting a
lot of things is that people will tweet

4613
02:00:04,051 --> 02:00:05,040
me a lot of cool shit.

4614
02:00:05,310 --> 02:00:05,970
So like,

4615
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:06,330
dude,

4616
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:08,460
the reason why I can tweet all this stuff,

4617
02:00:08,461 --> 02:00:11,520
it's because people are constantly sending
it to me knowing that if they send me

4618
02:00:11,521 --> 02:00:12,181
something cool,

4619
02:00:12,181 --> 02:00:13,014
I'll retweet it.

4620
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:15,100
The wolves going after the dude in Russia.

4621
02:00:15,790 --> 02:00:16,150
Yeah.

4622
02:00:16,150 --> 02:00:16,470
The Guy,

4623
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:16,780
the guy,

4624
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:17,680
the cop sitting there and he's like,

4625
02:00:17,681 --> 02:00:18,010
no.

4626
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:19,990
And then he hops in the car with
a wolves running down the street.

4627
02:00:20,050 --> 02:00:20,800
That wasn't a real,

4628
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:21,800
the what?

4629
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:22,071
Yeah,

4630
02:00:22,071 --> 02:00:22,671
it was artificial.

4631
02:00:22,671 --> 02:00:24,800
So many made that it's
amazing how good it looks.

4632
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:25,941
Yeah,

4633
02:00:25,941 --> 02:00:26,774
it's a scam.

4634
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:27,703
Looked amazing.

4635
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:27,981
Wait,

4636
02:00:27,981 --> 02:00:29,390
Brian might be wrong.

4637
02:00:29,391 --> 02:00:29,600
I mean,

4638
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:30,060
someone,

4639
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:32,370
someone might have called
it a hoax and it's not,

4640
02:00:32,510 --> 02:00:33,320
let's look up.

4641
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:33,840
What was your answer?

4642
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:34,130
What was it?

4643
02:00:34,130 --> 02:00:34,481
What was that?

4644
02:00:34,481 --> 02:00:36,380
Have you seen the hoax hold on.

4645
02:00:36,381 --> 02:00:36,801
Wolves,

4646
02:00:36,801 --> 02:00:37,670
cop car,

4647
02:00:39,050 --> 02:00:39,883
Russia

4648
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:41,981
hoax.

4649
02:00:41,981 --> 02:00:43,120
We'll just go look up that.

4650
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:44,310
We'll look up that.

4651
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:44,600
And,

4652
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:46,050
and someone tweet me right now.

4653
02:00:46,051 --> 02:00:46,681
What is the key?

4654
02:00:46,681 --> 02:00:48,610
It stairwell down a second

4655
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:49,001
dude.

4656
02:00:49,001 --> 02:00:49,451
It's there.

4657
02:00:49,451 --> 02:00:51,220
These are parents are
saying it's not fake.

4658
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:52,330
I've doesn't look fake.

4659
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:52,831
Yeah.

4660
02:00:52,831 --> 02:00:53,740
It didn't look fake to me,

4661
02:00:53,741 --> 02:00:55,690
but some people claim
that there was like some,

4662
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:56,583
um,

4663
02:00:57,070 --> 02:01:01,660
there was like some like aberration and
the video and then if you analyze the

4664
02:01:01,661 --> 02:01:02,200
video,

4665
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,780
but every youtube video looks like shit.

4666
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,240
The checkout at the screen.

4667
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:08,110
This is someone say it is fake though.

4668
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,033
This is a,

4669
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:12,580
that ghost town that you know that you
could just drive around this whole thing.

4670
02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:14,243
Um,

4671
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:17,800
does anyone know the name of that p
that stairwell where it's an infant

4672
02:01:17,801 --> 02:01:20,590
stairwell where it just goes round in
a circle and that one guy's hosting it.

4673
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:23,620
Have you seen that kit is a kit?

4674
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:24,311
What are you talking about?

4675
02:01:24,311 --> 02:01:25,144
Say it again.

4676
02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:26,143
Um,

4677
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:27,400
this is creepy.

4678
02:01:27,610 --> 02:01:30,810
There's a stairwell that
it goes around in as you,

4679
02:01:30,850 --> 02:01:31,870
as you walk up,

4680
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:33,490
you also then,

4681
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:33,940
okay.

4682
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:34,840
Show,

4683
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:35,693
do you know what I'm talking about?

4684
02:01:35,730 --> 02:01:36,563
Yeah.

4685
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:37,501
I'm sorry.

4686
02:01:37,501 --> 02:01:38,334
Keep going.

4687
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:39,933
Am I talking about,

4688
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,350
Oh,

4689
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:40,921
I know what you're talking.

4690
02:01:40,921 --> 02:01:41,290
Keep calling

4691
02:01:41,290 --> 02:01:42,400
K I t right.

4692
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:43,433
That was this [inaudible].

4693
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:44,200
What is that?

4694
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:45,370
Is that a hoax or is that real?

4695
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:46,363
I don't know.

4696
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,713
Have you seen the video?

4697
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:49,153
I think so,

4698
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:51,820
but they're seen so much.

4699
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:53,260
It's getting,

4700
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:54,010
it's getting tricky.

4701
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:54,790
I'll fall asleep if I could.

4702
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:55,880
That commercial the though

4703
02:01:56,140 --> 02:02:00,330
we saw though the wolf I'm running
down the street apparently is a voce

4704
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:01,173
commercial.

4705
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,860
It's a part of a Vod for commercial.

4706
02:02:02,910 --> 02:02:04,060
Are you fucking kidding me?

4707
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:04,700
Yeah.

4708
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:05,350
All right.

4709
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:06,370
I don't know if that's true though.

4710
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:07,420
I'm looking at it right now.

4711
02:02:07,450 --> 02:02:07,900
Yup.

4712
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:08,141
Yeah,

4713
02:02:08,141 --> 02:02:08,830
they set it up.

4714
02:02:08,830 --> 02:02:09,101
Okay.

4715
02:02:09,101 --> 02:02:09,611
They're showing,

4716
02:02:09,611 --> 02:02:10,600
the setup is showing,

4717
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:11,710
there's sewing.

4718
02:02:11,710 --> 02:02:15,220
A camera's booing moving
in place that she has fake.

4719
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:19,900
They have people working there and then
they added the wolves to it added the

4720
02:02:19,901 --> 02:02:20,950
wolves with CGI.

4721
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:24,280
But the reality of Russia is perfect.

4722
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:25,143
Ugly.

4723
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:26,310
What's the perfect ugliest?

4724
02:02:26,350 --> 02:02:28,000
Just tweeted me the fucking video.

4725
02:02:28,630 --> 02:02:29,740
The reality of Russia.

4726
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:31,120
Have you heard about these?

4727
02:02:31,121 --> 02:02:34,030
A Siberian super packs of wolves?

4728
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:34,900
I have.

4729
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:36,480
That's why I thought that was real.

4730
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:37,570
It's not,

4731
02:02:37,570 --> 02:02:39,170
but it could be the what?

4732
02:02:39,171 --> 02:02:41,590
What is real is way scarier than that.

4733
02:02:41,610 --> 02:02:42,160
Cause what?

4734
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:44,470
What that is is a standard pack,

4735
02:02:44,770 --> 02:02:47,050
but what they've got in Siberia,

4736
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:52,080
because of these record cold
temperatures is packs up 400 wolves,

4737
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:55,300
Roman together and decimating livestock.

4738
02:02:55,480 --> 02:03:00,160
They're coming over fences to attack
sheep and they're just slaughtering

4739
02:03:00,161 --> 02:03:00,910
everything.

4740
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:02,170
That's what that is.

4741
02:03:02,171 --> 02:03:04,780
What that the fact that that exists.

4742
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:07,600
It was what makes game of
Thrones so fucking real for me.

4743
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:08,201
Oh yeah.

4744
02:03:08,201 --> 02:03:08,660
Look,

4745
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:08,951
we're,

4746
02:03:08,951 --> 02:03:12,310
we are just protected or
protected by technology.

4747
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:14,740
It Brian Rit,

4748
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:16,530
stairwell rit.

4749
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:20,840
In four days these wolves
in Siberia killed 30 horses.

4750
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:23,113
Yeah,

4751
02:03:23,450 --> 02:03:25,430
30 horses in four days.

4752
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:27,290
That's a scary place to be,

4753
02:03:27,291 --> 02:03:27,890
man.

4754
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:29,000
Could you imagine if you lived on,

4755
02:03:29,790 --> 02:03:31,350
it's like getting caught
by a swarm of bees.

4756
02:03:31,351 --> 02:03:32,161
Swarm of killer bees.

4757
02:03:32,161 --> 02:03:32,880
Damn.

4758
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:33,713
That is the thing.

4759
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:35,880
Like I know you're a
game of Thrones fan also,

4760
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:37,560
like when you went on,

4761
02:03:37,561 --> 02:03:38,650
I'll just go back a couple of,

4762
02:03:38,651 --> 02:03:40,140
so it's not a spoiler for anyone.

4763
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:40,771
How dare you.

4764
02:03:40,771 --> 02:03:41,570
Don't even do it.

4765
02:03:41,570 --> 02:03:42,140
Yeah.

4766
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:42,390
Okay.

4767
02:03:42,390 --> 02:03:43,250
People Dvr.

4768
02:03:43,270 --> 02:03:44,103
What if they're deployed?

4769
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:45,510
Do you have hate for the troops?

4770
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:46,980
Okay guys,

4771
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:50,010
so you could always do what do you hate?

4772
02:03:50,011 --> 02:03:50,580
The truth.

4773
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:50,920
Okay,

4774
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:51,753
let's go back.

4775
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:54,000
Let's go when they killed Robb stark.

4776
02:03:54,450 --> 02:03:55,051
How dare you.

4777
02:03:55,051 --> 02:03:55,980
Oh my God.

4778
02:03:55,990 --> 02:03:59,040
You fucking [inaudible] man.

4779
02:03:59,041 --> 02:04:00,300
What if you start watching it?

4780
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:02,370
Are you you fuck.

4781
02:04:02,371 --> 02:04:03,650
Can we not talk about games of Thrones?

4782
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:05,700
It's the fucking greatest show on TV.

4783
02:04:06,730 --> 02:04:10,320
Did Tony Soprano die or did he not
die at the end of the fucking series?

4784
02:04:10,830 --> 02:04:11,041
Look,

4785
02:04:11,041 --> 02:04:11,461
watch this.

4786
02:04:11,461 --> 02:04:12,294
Watch this.

4787
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:13,403
Watch.

4788
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:14,880
This is the rit.

4789
02:04:14,881 --> 02:04:15,870
Our period I interior,

4790
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,460
very tasty designed by
Filipino architects.

4791
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:19,730
Rafael Nelson.

4792
02:04:19,731 --> 02:04:24,731
I'm Lagonda was built in 1968 and has
been wowing rit students ever since.

4793
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:28,130
One of the coolest things is Google,

4794
02:04:28,131 --> 02:04:28,964
that guy's name,

4795
02:04:29,230 --> 02:04:30,980
them experience that
for the first time here.

4796
02:04:31,050 --> 02:04:32,580
It's Rafael Lagonda.

4797
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:33,803
I'd make that grow.

4798
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:35,303
I saying that correctly.

4799
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:36,360
Okay.

4800
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:40,320
Hockeytech Rafaella Vonda a
Grad student in what program?

4801
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:41,773
Yep.

4802
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:43,283
Uh,

4803
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:44,551
okay.

4804
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:45,030
So,

4805
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:45,271
uh,

4806
02:04:45,271 --> 02:04:46,800
have you been here before to the sterile?

4807
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:49,100
Exactly.

4808
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:49,933
Yeah.

4809
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:51,263
Okay.

4810
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,070
Have you heard about it?

4811
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:59,190
But what I want you to do is just walk
up the stairs and wait for me on the next

4812
02:04:59,191 --> 02:05:00,024
floor.

4813
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:01,383
She'll watch a quick,

4814
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:03,090
tell me what it is.

4815
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:04,033
Okay.

4816
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:07,570
Check about the get Jack.

4817
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:10,070
This is not a scary,

4818
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:11,091
scary.

4819
02:05:11,091 --> 02:05:11,291
What?

4820
02:05:11,291 --> 02:05:11,570
No,

4821
02:05:11,570 --> 02:05:12,110
it's just,

4822
02:05:12,110 --> 02:05:12,943
it's just key.

4823
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:19,810
What did they try and do?

4824
02:05:19,811 --> 02:05:20,161
You'll see.

4825
02:05:20,161 --> 02:05:20,994
You'll see.

4826
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:23,980
I see Rosie,

4827
02:05:25,370 --> 02:05:29,010
so apparently this is
some sort of illusion.

4828
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:35,220
She came downstairs and
he was right in there.

4829
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,393
Yeah.

4830
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:37,800
How's it an illusion?

4831
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,570
I don't know.

4832
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:40,410
I can't figure it out.

4833
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:41,243
They say it.

4834
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:42,933
Look,

4835
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:45,010
it's true.

4836
02:05:45,010 --> 02:05:46,310
You can see that it's edited.

4837
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:47,450
That is a flat surface.

4838
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:51,640
It's a first step is a flat scoot ahead
to the black to black people are always

4839
02:05:51,641 --> 02:05:52,540
best in these things.

4840
02:05:53,330 --> 02:05:54,130
Black guys,

4841
02:05:54,130 --> 02:05:57,820
black men are the best when it comes to
any kind of magic trick or anything like

4842
02:05:57,821 --> 02:05:58,450
that.

4843
02:05:58,450 --> 02:05:59,283
Look at this guy.

4844
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:03,720
No,

4845
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:04,371
he's holding hands.

4846
02:06:04,371 --> 02:06:04,720
Hand.

4847
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:05,630
He's holding hands with everyone.

4848
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:08,240
No,

4849
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:08,690
he's holding.

4850
02:06:08,690 --> 02:06:09,680
He's at the stairwell corner.

4851
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:11,690
If you've tricked me
into watching a gay porn,

4852
02:06:11,691 --> 02:06:12,950
I'm going to be really upset at you.

4853
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:17,853
Okay.

4854
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:25,100
No,

4855
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:26,180
I don't believe that at all.

4856
02:06:26,570 --> 02:06:27,500
He went downstairs.

4857
02:06:27,501 --> 02:06:27,801
Come on.

4858
02:06:27,801 --> 02:06:28,760
What are you stupid?

4859
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:29,720
What's wrong with your brain?

4860
02:06:29,721 --> 02:06:30,554
What are you talking about?

4861
02:06:30,670 --> 02:06:31,503
You broke,

4862
02:06:33,230 --> 02:06:34,063
edited that.

4863
02:06:34,070 --> 02:06:35,030
There's no way to edit it.

4864
02:06:35,090 --> 02:06:36,140
What are you talking about?

4865
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:38,900
Do you know what fucking
they can you ever see Avatar?

4866
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:39,141
Yeah.

4867
02:06:39,141 --> 02:06:39,974
That's not real.

4868
02:06:40,330 --> 02:06:41,163
Listen,

4869
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:42,920
you listen to this motherfucker.

4870
02:06:43,070 --> 02:06:45,990
Did you Google hoax and fucking Google it?

4871
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:46,971
There's no proof.

4872
02:06:46,971 --> 02:06:47,960
What's the name of the video?

4873
02:06:48,170 --> 02:06:51,560
R.

4874
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:51,560
I.

4875
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:51,560
T.

4876
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:51,620
T.

4877
02:06:51,620 --> 02:06:54,650
It's at the Rochester
Institute of Technology

4878
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,740
hoax and it's a real,

4879
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:03,140
see how the are big
girls squirrel illusion.

4880
02:07:03,141 --> 02:07:03,681
That's how it works.

4881
02:07:03,681 --> 02:07:04,090
Brian,

4882
02:07:04,090 --> 02:07:05,690
you guys give it up to each other.

4883
02:07:05,691 --> 02:07:06,320
I love it.

4884
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:06,740
Okay.

4885
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:07,640
How does it work?

4886
02:07:07,641 --> 02:07:08,030
Well,

4887
02:07:08,030 --> 02:07:08,863
it doesn't.

4888
02:07:09,230 --> 02:07:11,630
What you're witnessing is
the illusion of an illusion.

4889
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:12,291
In short,

4890
02:07:12,291 --> 02:07:15,680
the video is a fake you fucking dummies.

4891
02:07:15,980 --> 02:07:20,980
This is a variation on a concept called
Penn rose stairs created in 1959 which

4892
02:07:21,981 --> 02:07:26,981
itself has roots in an illusion created
in the 1930s I'll get back to the rit

4893
02:07:27,111 --> 02:07:28,100
stairwell in a moment,

4894
02:07:28,101 --> 02:07:31,430
but let's trace the evolution of
the illusion in 1934 switches,

4895
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:33,260
Swedish graphic designer,

4896
02:07:33,290 --> 02:07:34,000
Oscar,

4897
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:34,450
blah.

4898
02:07:34,450 --> 02:07:35,950
My questions this don't break.com

4899
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,980
created a series of optical illusions
that we're all familiar with now created a

4900
02:07:41,081 --> 02:07:45,520
series of three d geometric figures
that are only possible in two d space,

4901
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,770
and not only did he create
impossible triangle,

4902
02:07:47,771 --> 02:07:49,810
you also created the impossible staircase.

4903
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:52,290
That's how it works right there.

4904
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:52,591
Yeah.

4905
02:07:52,591 --> 02:07:54,600
I guess there's a slant
and that's a little smart.

4906
02:07:55,490 --> 02:07:55,930
Okay.

4907
02:07:55,930 --> 02:07:56,763
It's easy.

4908
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:57,491
So you go up,

4909
02:07:57,491 --> 02:07:58,390
but you also come down.

4910
02:07:58,391 --> 02:07:58,471
Yeah.

4911
02:07:58,471 --> 02:07:59,060
Yeah.

4912
02:07:59,060 --> 02:07:59,893
And then you go,

4913
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:00,880
dude,

4914
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:01,713
I was fucking,

4915
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:02,553
it's stupid.

4916
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:04,450
Stupid as fuck.

4917
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:06,280
If you looked at mom for building it,

4918
02:08:06,281 --> 02:08:07,510
that guy's dumb for building it.

4919
02:08:07,511 --> 02:08:08,880
You're dumb for sweetening it.

4920
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:10,510
Everybody's dumb as fuck.

4921
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:11,020
If you looked,

4922
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:13,150
I'm trying to talk to you about big
foot problem out there looking for,

4923
02:08:13,151 --> 02:08:13,984
okay.

4924
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:16,331
Okay.

4925
02:08:16,331 --> 02:08:16,631
Wait.

4926
02:08:16,631 --> 02:08:16,961
So wait.

4927
02:08:16,961 --> 02:08:17,231
So wait.

4928
02:08:17,231 --> 02:08:18,064
So wait,

4929
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:19,000
so this is,

4930
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,160
this was my pitch a long time ago to,

4931
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:25,180
to a network is that I would go find
the number one big foot hunter in the

4932
02:08:25,181 --> 02:08:25,630
country.

4933
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:27,130
I would give them $50,000 and say,

4934
02:08:27,131 --> 02:08:27,910
this is it.

4935
02:08:27,910 --> 02:08:29,290
When did you come up with this idea of,

4936
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:32,170
this is true for like eight years ago.

4937
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:32,870
Why didn't they listen?

4938
02:08:32,870 --> 02:08:33,220
Yeah.

4939
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:33,580
Uh,

4940
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:33,970
well,

4941
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:34,870
you haven't heard the pension.

4942
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:38,590
Every one of my big pitch
and Bob Gay sex and Lacrosse,

4943
02:08:38,620 --> 02:08:40,150
every one of my pages suck.

4944
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:41,093
Joe.

4945
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:44,350
The losing team gets fucked
in front of the Sasquatch.

4946
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:47,860
I pitched moat crashers to DIY crashers,

4947
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:48,070
right?

4948
02:08:48,070 --> 02:08:50,320
Like people have a moat knowing
people in America have a moat.

4949
02:08:50,321 --> 02:08:51,250
That'd be dope as fuck.

4950
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,060
Thank you.

4951
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:52,670
Oh my God.

4952
02:08:52,670 --> 02:08:53,950
You being a chick home,

4953
02:08:54,070 --> 02:08:54,640
Brian.

4954
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:54,971
Come on.

4955
02:08:54,971 --> 02:08:55,481
Think about this.

4956
02:08:55,481 --> 02:08:56,980
Brian is the only one single here.

4957
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:57,431
Brian,

4958
02:08:57,431 --> 02:08:58,060
think about this.

4959
02:08:58,060 --> 02:08:58,781
Give me some,

4960
02:08:58,781 --> 02:09:02,020
give me some fucking pimp music and
I'm going to paint a picture for you.

4961
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:03,340
I'm going to come home.

4962
02:09:03,380 --> 02:09:04,120
I'll lose my mind.

4963
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:05,110
You're going to come home.

4964
02:09:05,410 --> 02:09:06,460
Oh Brian,

4965
02:09:06,670 --> 02:09:07,540
you take a chick,

4966
02:09:07,930 --> 02:09:09,040
you drive her home and you're,

4967
02:09:09,070 --> 02:09:09,370
you're,

4968
02:09:09,370 --> 02:09:13,090
you're murdered out Ford Suv I with you.

4969
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:14,830
You bring her to a bridge.

4970
02:09:14,831 --> 02:09:15,071
You say,

4971
02:09:15,071 --> 02:09:15,820
hey baby,

4972
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:18,790
don't be worried because the water is
only six feet deep and I'm sure you can

4973
02:09:18,791 --> 02:09:19,330
swim.

4974
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:20,081
And the crocodiles,

4975
02:09:20,081 --> 02:09:23,050
we feed them every day so it's
really more scary to look at,

4976
02:09:23,290 --> 02:09:24,610
but a no big deal.

4977
02:09:24,611 --> 02:09:25,210
Okay,

4978
02:09:25,210 --> 02:09:26,050
we're going to make it across

4979
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:27,103
drawbridge.

4980
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:29,200
And then as you,

4981
02:09:29,530 --> 02:09:34,530
as you have them in your murdered out
Suv and you're rocking some Mc Chris,

4982
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:35,260
and he'd go,

4983
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:35,741
by the way,

4984
02:09:35,741 --> 02:09:36,574
Mc Chris,

4985
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:39,910
he tweeted me once and you casually
like show him your phone real quick.

4986
02:09:40,030 --> 02:09:40,181
Yeah,

4987
02:09:40,181 --> 02:09:41,350
that's an MC Chris tweet.

4988
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:43,000
I saved it in my favorites.

4989
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:43,871
Anyway.

4990
02:09:43,871 --> 02:09:44,230
Um,

4991
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:46,450
this is my mode and this is my castle.

4992
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:52,140
I had all this built totally
ecofriendly I built it out of assholes.

4993
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:53,890
It's made out of assholes.

4994
02:09:53,891 --> 02:09:55,510
It's the most eco friendly house ever.

4995
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:56,553
What's up?

4996
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:58,250
Oh you fuck.

4997
02:09:58,250 --> 02:09:59,083
Oh fuck.

4998
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:00,401
Sorry.

4999
02:10:00,401 --> 02:10:01,234
I should,

5000
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:02,700
I think would be a good move.

5001
02:10:02,790 --> 02:10:03,540
So Mo,

5002
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:04,320
I pitched it,

5003
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,450
I pitched it to DIY that
they have no one has a moat.

5004
02:10:06,451 --> 02:10:06,640
No.

5005
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:06,960
Every,

5006
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,430
every key man's house is his castle.

5007
02:10:08,431 --> 02:10:09,310
Every castle needs a moat.

5008
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:11,580
I fill in and you moved
the fuck out of a house.

5009
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:12,870
I think that's a good idea.

5010
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:16,410
And I think also what's a good
idea is not ever needing a moat.

5011
02:10:16,710 --> 02:10:17,760
What's the good idea?

5012
02:10:17,761 --> 02:10:19,350
Is that the anti moat,

5013
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:24,920
the Anti Kingdom to let people know that
somehow or another we have been tricked

5014
02:10:25,021 --> 02:10:27,900
into thinking that we need to be in
battle with each other for in order for us

5015
02:10:27,901 --> 02:10:30,210
to be fruitful and survive and to do well.

5016
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:31,590
And that shit is nonsense.

5017
02:10:31,890 --> 02:10:34,010
And the only reason why you
need a moat is cause you need

5018
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,700
to believe that this sort of feudalist
state and this ridiculous society that we

5019
02:10:37,701 --> 02:10:40,910
live in is going to maintain the way it
is instead of just surrounding yourself

5020
02:10:40,911 --> 02:10:44,480
with a gigantic group of loving people
and spread that out as much as possible.

5021
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:45,403
That's what I'm saying.

5022
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:47,930
How would a motive love amount of love,

5023
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:49,333
wait,

5024
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:51,830
wait,

5025
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:52,130
wait,

5026
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:52,251
wait.

5027
02:10:52,251 --> 02:10:53,770
Mark Jannis here.

5028
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:54,530
You leaving.

5029
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:54,861
Okay.

5030
02:10:54,861 --> 02:10:57,020
Brian was leaving the building.

5031
02:10:57,021 --> 02:10:57,854
Ladies and gentlemen,

5032
02:10:58,040 --> 02:10:58,940
but worry not,

5033
02:10:58,970 --> 02:11:01,550
he will be a live on air,

5034
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:02,060
uh,

5035
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:03,290
at the comedy store tonight.

5036
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:04,940
If you want to listen,

5037
02:11:04,941 --> 02:11:05,760
go to d,

5038
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:06,020
uh,

5039
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:06,441
Ustream.

5040
02:11:06,441 --> 02:11:06,960
Dot TV.

5041
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:07,793
That's my bad.

5042
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:09,081
You don't do it like,

5043
02:11:09,081 --> 02:11:10,850
I mean we recorded it but
was just a secret show.

5044
02:11:11,710 --> 02:11:15,500
It will air sometime in July of 2016,

5045
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:18,973
11,

5046
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:19,431
11.

5047
02:11:19,431 --> 02:11:20,390
Teen muffs heads.

5048
02:11:20,391 --> 02:11:21,260
He has on ice.

5049
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:23,870
Fucking try promoting something.

5050
02:11:23,871 --> 02:11:25,010
I don't want to Brian's podcast.

5051
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:26,630
Why don't you bring those guys in here?

5052
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:27,080
Um,

5053
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:27,740
bring Kevin.

5054
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:28,700
Kevin needs to come back.

5055
02:11:28,701 --> 02:11:29,470
Can for sure.

5056
02:11:29,470 --> 02:11:29,780
Yeah.

5057
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:30,500
Yeah.

5058
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:32,240
And maybe we'll bring Ryan,

5059
02:11:32,241 --> 02:11:33,140
Kelly and Kevin Together.

5060
02:11:33,141 --> 02:11:34,130
That would actually be fun.

5061
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:35,690
That actually would be a fun.

5062
02:11:35,740 --> 02:11:36,270
Uh,

5063
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:36,960
it's true,

5064
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:37,610
you know.

5065
02:11:37,610 --> 02:11:38,140
Okay.

5066
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:39,050
Desktop promotion show.

5067
02:11:40,190 --> 02:11:41,030
Are you really leaving Brian?

5068
02:11:41,031 --> 02:11:41,511
That kind of stuff.

5069
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:42,344
He's got to go to work.

5070
02:11:42,830 --> 02:11:43,820
We'll still talk bitch.

5071
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:45,110
You don't love me anymore.

5072
02:11:46,410 --> 02:11:46,690
Give me some.

5073
02:11:46,690 --> 02:11:46,981
Here's,

5074
02:11:46,981 --> 02:11:47,790
but here's a,

5075
02:11:47,790 --> 02:11:48,930
here's the other idea.

5076
02:11:49,530 --> 02:11:52,610
So I find the number one big
funder foot hunter in the right.

5077
02:11:52,650 --> 02:11:53,340
Okay.

5078
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:53,851
I go up to him.

5079
02:11:53,851 --> 02:11:55,520
I say go into his house supplies,

5080
02:11:55,530 --> 02:11:57,750
not like publisher clearing house.

5081
02:11:57,990 --> 02:11:58,490
Oh,

5082
02:11:58,490 --> 02:11:59,011
it's your name.

5083
02:11:59,011 --> 02:11:59,610
Uh,

5084
02:11:59,610 --> 02:12:00,443
Derek Johnson.

5085
02:12:00,610 --> 02:12:02,570
Like who the fuck are you and
how'd you get to my house?

5086
02:12:02,571 --> 02:12:03,810
And he shoot you in the chest.

5087
02:12:03,870 --> 02:12:05,460
But it was Bert Craig Craig style.

5088
02:12:05,490 --> 02:12:07,200
See Brian or Jenny Jones style.

5089
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:07,650
Uh,

5090
02:12:07,650 --> 02:12:08,580
my name is Bert Kreischer.

5091
02:12:08,581 --> 02:12:12,790
I worked for a travel
channel.travel channel and a.com.

5092
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:16,920
That's [inaudible] dot com I worked for
travel channel and I have $50,000 to

5093
02:12:16,921 --> 02:12:18,090
give to the number one,

5094
02:12:19,530 --> 02:12:20,340
the number one what?

5095
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:23,250
I got $50,000 to give you the number
one big foot hunter to take you on.

5096
02:12:23,260 --> 02:12:25,870
You're $50,000 what kind
of a budget is that?

5097
02:12:25,871 --> 02:12:26,704
That's ridiculous.

5098
02:12:26,770 --> 02:12:29,860
I will become the number one big
foot under zero fucking contest.

5099
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:30,341
Here we go.

5100
02:12:30,341 --> 02:12:31,151
Like 50 k.

5101
02:12:31,151 --> 02:12:31,950
I'm very competitive.

5102
02:12:31,950 --> 02:12:32,760
Burt Christ want,

5103
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:34,830
I want this guy to have everything at his.

5104
02:12:35,010 --> 02:12:36,780
I want him to have everything he needs.

5105
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:38,213
I go,

5106
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:41,430
your trip leaves Sunday morning
and he's through the roof.

5107
02:12:41,431 --> 02:12:42,960
You got 50 grand for the his passion.

5108
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:44,880
He shuts the door and then I
look at the camera and I go,

5109
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:47,250
my trip starts Thursday.

5110
02:12:47,430 --> 02:12:48,840
So you're gonna fake bigfoot and I,

5111
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:50,350
but you watched this guy.

5112
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:52,080
The fact you're going to fake bigfoot.

5113
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:53,810
No,

5114
02:12:53,810 --> 02:12:53,921
no,

5115
02:12:53,921 --> 02:12:54,180
no.

5116
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:56,010
That's the show is watching the number.

5117
02:12:56,011 --> 02:12:56,230
What?

5118
02:12:56,230 --> 02:13:00,160
Bigfoot hunter find big foot seven times
without the camera crews around going

5119
02:13:00,161 --> 02:13:00,994
like,

5120
02:13:01,130 --> 02:13:01,821
I swear to God,

5121
02:13:01,821 --> 02:13:02,540
I saw him.

5122
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:07,540
What if the number one big foot hunter
has an internet connection and downloads

5123
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:10,580
this podcast or is listening right now,

5124
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:11,733
eight years ago,

5125
02:13:12,230 --> 02:13:12,891
eight years ago,

5126
02:13:12,891 --> 02:13:13,730
Bert Kreischer,

5127
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:16,970
you weren't the Bert Kreischer
of 2013 eight years ago.

5128
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:18,283
Jesus Christ.

5129
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:21,350
Do you have any old jokes that didn't
work at the time cause you weren't really

5130
02:13:21,351 --> 02:13:23,830
that good at comedy and
as you get along and go,

5131
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:26,210
oh that bitch got some sauce to it.

5132
02:13:26,690 --> 02:13:30,320
I had a bit that was a real game changer
because it would tag my act and I had

5133
02:13:30,321 --> 02:13:31,154
to throw it away,

5134
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:32,310
but then as I've done

5135
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:34,860
like three new hours over
the last three years,

5136
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:39,870
I get to a point where I started like
trying to find some shit like go over my

5137
02:13:39,871 --> 02:13:40,704
notes.

5138
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:44,010
Is there anything that I wrote that I
missed and I've found some stuff that I

5139
02:13:44,011 --> 02:13:44,844
wasn't good enough

5140
02:13:44,890 --> 02:13:45,280
to do.

5141
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:48,040
It sucks about these young kids that just
go in and know how to do 20 minutes of

5142
02:13:48,041 --> 02:13:50,770
murder and aren't writing a
bunch of growing up in Boston,

5143
02:13:50,771 --> 02:13:51,131
in New York,

5144
02:13:51,131 --> 02:13:54,790
you just wrote so much that you had
bits that you go look back down when

5145
02:13:54,791 --> 02:13:55,180
revisit,

5146
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:56,013
you're like damn

5147
02:13:56,170 --> 02:13:56,411
yeah,

5148
02:13:56,411 --> 02:13:57,490
it's hard when you start,

5149
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:58,301
when will also,

5150
02:13:58,301 --> 02:14:01,420
when you're like trying to like
make it as a standup comedian,

5151
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:06,480
there's a real issue where people like
you're scared to take any chances so you

5152
02:14:08,501 --> 02:14:12,100
lock into a few bits that you have a lot
of confidence in and that you've done

5153
02:14:12,130 --> 02:14:12,401
many,

5154
02:14:12,401 --> 02:14:12,971
many times.

5155
02:14:12,971 --> 02:14:16,660
So you're pretty sure that work
and it can become a real crutch.

5156
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:19,950
It become a real bad thing
for young guys and we,

5157
02:14:19,951 --> 02:14:24,130
we know those young guys and have that
like 1520 minutes that just crush.

5158
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:28,930
But then we know those sleeper dudes who
aren't as attached to crushing as they

5159
02:14:28,931 --> 02:14:31,240
are to creating and those early Tripoli,

5160
02:14:31,250 --> 02:14:32,490
I swear to God when I watch tripling,

5161
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:33,400
I was going to say Bill Burr,

5162
02:14:33,610 --> 02:14:34,210
Bill Burr,

5163
02:14:34,210 --> 02:14:35,530
Bill burr too.

5164
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:36,180
But no,

5165
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:38,050
but I love triple it because
you didn't take some chances.

5166
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:38,561
He does.

5167
02:14:38,561 --> 02:14:42,220
I think he's the guy that every
fucking time takes a chance.

5168
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:46,150
Bill burrs bills constantly
writing bill was on the podcast.

5169
02:14:46,151 --> 02:14:47,230
One of the coolest things that he said,

5170
02:14:47,530 --> 02:14:47,981
he was,

5171
02:14:47,981 --> 02:14:48,490
um,

5172
02:14:48,490 --> 02:14:49,300
talking about,

5173
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:49,720
uh,

5174
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:50,531
creating shit.

5175
02:14:50,531 --> 02:14:51,110
He's like,

5176
02:14:51,110 --> 02:14:51,280
Dang,

5177
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:52,113
cause I've got a rule.

5178
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:52,601
He goes,

5179
02:14:52,601 --> 02:14:53,051
ah,

5180
02:14:53,051 --> 02:14:53,591
I'm a,

5181
02:14:53,591 --> 02:14:54,041
you know,

5182
02:14:54,041 --> 02:14:54,791
I didn't say no.

5183
02:14:54,791 --> 02:14:55,131
I have a,

5184
02:14:55,131 --> 02:14:55,811
I'm going to come back.

5185
02:14:55,811 --> 02:14:56,644
I'm not going to fuck you.

5186
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:57,431
I'm not gonna fuck.

5187
02:14:57,431 --> 02:14:57,610
Yeah,

5188
02:14:57,610 --> 02:14:57,911
that's,

5189
02:14:57,911 --> 02:14:58,451
that's my,

5190
02:14:58,451 --> 02:14:58,660
uh,

5191
02:14:58,660 --> 02:14:59,493
my agreement.

5192
02:14:59,530 --> 02:14:59,960
I come,

5193
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:01,000
I'll have some new material.

5194
02:15:01,001 --> 02:15:01,810
I'm not going to fuck you.

5195
02:15:01,810 --> 02:15:02,420
How the,

5196
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:02,950
you know,

5197
02:15:02,950 --> 02:15:04,210
Tosh said to me one time,

5198
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:05,141
I was like,

5199
02:15:05,141 --> 02:15:05,541
God damn,

5200
02:15:05,541 --> 02:15:05,770
man,

5201
02:15:05,770 --> 02:15:06,730
all your shit's knew.

5202
02:15:06,731 --> 02:15:08,170
And I felt like I didn't
have it right that much.

5203
02:15:08,171 --> 02:15:08,471
And he goes,

5204
02:15:08,471 --> 02:15:09,220
well,

5205
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:09,371
yeah,

5206
02:15:09,371 --> 02:15:12,130
but you're not in the position
in your career where it matters.

5207
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:15,370
Like you should go in and do the best
show you can so that they come back next

5208
02:15:15,370 --> 02:15:17,560
year and then start
complaining and say like,

5209
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:18,130
look,

5210
02:15:18,130 --> 02:15:18,461
he goes,

5211
02:15:18,461 --> 02:15:20,320
right now I'm at the place where
if I don't write a new hour,

5212
02:15:20,321 --> 02:15:21,700
they'd feel like they'd gotten ripped off.

5213
02:15:22,470 --> 02:15:25,080
You have to definitely
write a lot of new shit,

5214
02:15:25,081 --> 02:15:28,140
but then people get pissed if
you don't do certain classics.

5215
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:29,380
But I always say I'm,

5216
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:30,960
I don't even know how to do them anymore.

5217
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:33,360
Like I've had people yell
out Duana Nicole Smith.

5218
02:15:33,361 --> 02:15:33,870
I'm like,

5219
02:15:33,870 --> 02:15:34,381
listen man,

5220
02:15:34,381 --> 02:15:36,030
you could probably do it
better than I could do it.

5221
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:37,410
Cause I know when I was a kid,

5222
02:15:37,411 --> 02:15:39,450
when I was at like big Sam Kinison Fan,

5223
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:41,700
I could do a Sam Kinison bent.

5224
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:42,361
Like if you,

5225
02:15:42,361 --> 02:15:42,601
like,

5226
02:15:42,601 --> 02:15:44,130
if I had to like do it for a friend,

5227
02:15:44,131 --> 02:15:45,030
I could do it for a friend.

5228
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:46,980
Your writing changed your,

5229
02:15:46,981 --> 02:15:49,470
your voice on stage has changed
so much since that time.

5230
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:50,091
Yeah.

5231
02:15:50,091 --> 02:15:50,241
Well,

5232
02:15:50,241 --> 02:15:51,530
I'm a different human being,

5233
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:52,160
you know?

5234
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:56,810
I mean I think it's really silly to
try to stick with who you used to be,

5235
02:15:57,150 --> 02:15:57,500
you know?

5236
02:15:57,500 --> 02:16:00,030
Or to be a sort of uh,

5237
02:16:00,070 --> 02:16:00,590
uh,

5238
02:16:00,590 --> 02:16:05,590
invested and not changing who you are
or are not evolving or not adding new

5239
02:16:05,931 --> 02:16:06,590
things.

5240
02:16:06,590 --> 02:16:07,850
I've seen a lot of people change,

5241
02:16:07,851 --> 02:16:08,360
man.

5242
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:09,850
I just know a lot of people change.

5243
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:13,220
I think change is a beautiful
thing and I've seen Brian Chanes,

5244
02:16:13,221 --> 02:16:14,750
Eddie Bravo has changed the law.

5245
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:15,440
You know,

5246
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:18,710
we had Dan Hardee in here last week
and he was talking about his Iowasca

5247
02:16:18,711 --> 02:16:19,350
experience.

5248
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:21,150
That was one of the best
podcasts I've listened to.

5249
02:16:21,210 --> 02:16:21,690
I like,

5250
02:16:21,690 --> 02:16:23,420
I like the win.

5251
02:16:23,610 --> 02:16:28,610
I think when your podcast is at its best
is when you take a guy like GSP or Dan

5252
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:30,393
that I don't,

5253
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:36,240
I don't expect much other than maybe
like some UFC conversation or some like

5254
02:16:36,761 --> 02:16:41,080
talking about some training stuff or
like diet and then I done fucking blown

5255
02:16:41,081 --> 02:16:42,250
away by what fascinating.

5256
02:16:42,251 --> 02:16:43,030
That's a reason.

5257
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:43,990
It's like Chael Sonnen,

5258
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:47,260
it really defines the UFC fighter
in general is that they're not,

5259
02:16:47,261 --> 02:16:48,850
they're more renaissance than they are.

5260
02:16:49,210 --> 02:16:51,430
This fighting is fighting is,

5261
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:54,730
it's like all school fucking
Ernest Hemingway put your dukes up.

5262
02:16:54,731 --> 02:16:55,090
Shit.

5263
02:16:55,090 --> 02:16:56,080
It's not everywhere.

5264
02:16:56,250 --> 02:16:56,820
Yeah,

5265
02:16:56,820 --> 02:17:01,750
it's like that Dan Hardee podcasts on
the treadmill and I'm fucking googling,

5266
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:02,620
uh,

5267
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:06,250
the Lee Marie Jo.

5268
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:07,331
I swear to God,

5269
02:17:07,331 --> 02:17:08,290
I'll get on a fucking plane,

5270
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:09,990
do a fucking visitor with that guy.

5271
02:17:10,110 --> 02:17:10,661
He can,

5272
02:17:10,661 --> 02:17:11,950
he's in Morocco prison.

5273
02:17:11,951 --> 02:17:15,020
You don't want to go to Morocco
and visit [inaudible] prison.

5274
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:19,210
They'll check your asshole with a
microscope to look for what's chips.

5275
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:20,140
What's the other dude?

5276
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:20,830
Uh,

5277
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:21,210
uh,

5278
02:17:21,210 --> 02:17:22,480
Hartnett Harley,

5279
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:23,230
um,

5280
02:17:23,230 --> 02:17:23,960
wolf,

5281
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:24,793
goddammit.

5282
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:29,970
The other guy that was fucking just a
beast that would sucker punch dudes and,

5283
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:30,903
and uh,

5284
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:33,380
so it was like the second guy you
talked about him and then they,

5285
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:34,120
what?

5286
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:34,953
Bronson not,

5287
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:35,391
no,

5288
02:17:35,391 --> 02:17:35,710
no,

5289
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:36,543
but like,

5290
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:36,850
but,

5291
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:40,150
but it was when you were talking
about an MMA guy and I'm Omega Wolf,

5292
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:40,721
Tiger Wolf,

5293
02:17:40,721 --> 02:17:41,020
wolf,

5294
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:41,560
pussy.

5295
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:43,150
Something like that is not full of pussy.

5296
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:43,750
It was,

5297
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:44,081
wow.

5298
02:17:44,081 --> 02:17:44,770
I don't know who you're telling.

5299
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:45,730
You might've made some money up,

5300
02:17:45,790 --> 02:17:47,530
somebody take medicine then go to sleep.

5301
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:47,891
No,

5302
02:17:47,891 --> 02:17:49,610
but I was hung over jogging and I'm,

5303
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:51,650
but Goddamn,

5304
02:17:51,750 --> 02:17:53,880
and those two fucking
interviews back to back world,

5305
02:17:53,881 --> 02:17:55,060
like he knew what it is.

5306
02:17:55,061 --> 02:17:57,040
It's like people don't get a chance.

5307
02:17:57,130 --> 02:18:02,130
It's very rare that people get a chance
to sit down and really talk for like two

5308
02:18:02,441 --> 02:18:03,280
plus hours,

5309
02:18:03,281 --> 02:18:04,210
three hours.

5310
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:04,570
Yeah.

5311
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:05,530
That time I couldn't,

5312
02:18:05,531 --> 02:18:08,320
I had to go with my kids to
Disneyland was my daughter's birthday.

5313
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:09,231
And so,

5314
02:18:09,231 --> 02:18:09,331
uh,

5315
02:18:09,331 --> 02:18:11,230
I had to take her to
Disneyland so I could,

5316
02:18:11,231 --> 02:18:12,520
we could only do like two hours.

5317
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:13,450
You should have Moen again,

5318
02:18:13,451 --> 02:18:17,890
dad for sure he's going to be
on because we barely got to his,

5319
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:18,161
uh,

5320
02:18:18,161 --> 02:18:20,090
Iowasca experience and everyone,

5321
02:18:20,091 --> 02:18:20,271
everybody,

5322
02:18:20,271 --> 02:18:20,741
people like,

5323
02:18:20,741 --> 02:18:20,921
yeah,

5324
02:18:20,921 --> 02:18:21,530
he barely talked

5325
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:21,920
about that.

5326
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:22,200
Yeah,

5327
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:22,890
you're right.

5328
02:18:22,890 --> 02:18:23,641
Absolutely.

5329
02:18:23,641 --> 02:18:24,181
Like people,

5330
02:18:24,181 --> 02:18:24,421
that's,

5331
02:18:24,421 --> 02:18:24,691
that,

5332
02:18:24,691 --> 02:18:25,170
that,

5333
02:18:25,170 --> 02:18:28,080
that were bummed out about
that is just because it was,

5334
02:18:28,081 --> 02:18:29,400
that's how the conversation went.

5335
02:18:29,401 --> 02:18:32,190
And this is something I want people
to kind of understand when it comes to

5336
02:18:32,220 --> 02:18:33,053
podcasting.

5337
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:34,500
I can,

5338
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,180
I sometimes,

5339
02:18:36,181 --> 02:18:36,601
yes,

5340
02:18:36,601 --> 02:18:37,111
you're right.

5341
02:18:37,111 --> 02:18:38,580
Like sometimes like maybe,

5342
02:18:38,581 --> 02:18:39,414
um,

5343
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:44,660
things go too much in one direction or
not enough in another or one person talks

5344
02:18:45,841 --> 02:18:46,680
too much or,

5345
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:50,760
but the emphasis is always on
trying to do the best show.

5346
02:18:50,910 --> 02:18:51,780
So when you,

5347
02:18:51,781 --> 02:18:54,210
if you give like a criticism about that,

5348
02:18:54,211 --> 02:18:54,631
believe me,

5349
02:18:54,631 --> 02:18:55,464
I listened to that.

5350
02:18:55,590 --> 02:18:56,340
And,

5351
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:57,060
um,

5352
02:18:57,060 --> 02:18:58,260
it's just Dan's my friend.

5353
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:02,430
So what will you got to see was like me
and Dan just shooting the shit and me

5354
02:19:02,431 --> 02:19:04,110
trying to get something out of him.

5355
02:19:04,111 --> 02:19:04,801
But we,

5356
02:19:04,801 --> 02:19:09,780
both of us having like points that we
wanted to make and it's conversations like

5357
02:19:09,781 --> 02:19:10,530
that,

5358
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:10,861
you know,

5359
02:19:10,861 --> 02:19:14,700
and you just sort of were
there organically taking
place completely naturally

5360
02:19:14,701 --> 02:19:16,800
taking place and you have
anything planned out,

5361
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:18,870
but just a rough roadmap of where to go.

5362
02:19:19,290 --> 02:19:21,480
They don't always wind up,

5363
02:19:21,930 --> 02:19:24,210
especially when it's like only going
to be a limited amount of time is two

5364
02:19:24,211 --> 02:19:25,020
hours.

5365
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:26,400
They don't always wind up,

5366
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:26,880
uh,

5367
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:29,290
where you want them to go or get
everything in you want it to.

5368
02:19:29,410 --> 02:19:31,240
So that's why I said at the
end of that podcast like,

5369
02:19:31,241 --> 02:19:31,590
Hey,

5370
02:19:31,590 --> 02:19:32,351
we've got to do this again,

5371
02:19:32,351 --> 02:19:33,184
like two weeks.

5372
02:19:33,190 --> 02:19:34,900
I heard you in the middle of say you go,

5373
02:19:35,170 --> 02:19:35,891
I know guys,

5374
02:19:35,891 --> 02:19:36,790
I'll get to the Iowa Ska,

5375
02:19:36,791 --> 02:19:37,840
but dead honest with you.

5376
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:41,380
I had forgotten about the IOWASCA and
I was interested in what you guys were

5377
02:19:41,381 --> 02:19:46,090
talking about and that's the way it
podcasts at its best should go is just be,

5378
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:47,000
oh,

5379
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:51,820
and I'm telling you dead honestly from
a guy who's done radio for fucking eight

5380
02:19:51,821 --> 02:19:55,810
years of going in and doing radio
and you go in and you definitely Bam,

5381
02:19:55,811 --> 02:19:56,081
Bam,

5382
02:19:56,081 --> 02:19:56,381
Bam,

5383
02:19:56,381 --> 02:19:56,710
Bam,

5384
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:57,970
this is not that medium.

5385
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:01,120
This medium is a new thing.

5386
02:20:01,150 --> 02:20:01,983
It's almost a,

5387
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:05,830
a new honesty that's
uncomfortable as an entertainer.

5388
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:07,040
It is uncomfortable.

5389
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:07,690
It's uncommon.

5390
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:09,140
It's a lot of it is uncomfortable.

5391
02:20:09,350 --> 02:20:11,420
It's uncomfortable to present it.

5392
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:13,400
It's uncomfortable to read the criticism.

5393
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:15,160
It's uncomfortable to,

5394
02:20:15,190 --> 02:20:15,520
uh,

5395
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:17,360
to try to analyze it and watch it.

5396
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:21,200
But that's also what's really good
about it because as much as it's

5397
02:20:21,201 --> 02:20:23,270
uncomfortable to be a part of it,

5398
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:25,310
like it's very inspiring.

5399
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:27,440
Podcasts are very inspiring for people.

5400
02:20:27,770 --> 02:20:31,340
And even podcasts that aren't
necessarily like this kind of podcasts.

5401
02:20:31,341 --> 02:20:33,800
Like I always go on and
on about hardcore history,

5402
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,161
but it's,

5403
02:20:34,161 --> 02:20:36,500
cause that's all I've been watching
or listening to these days.

5404
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:38,480
All I listened to is Dan Carlin.

5405
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:39,290
Talk about Ma.

5406
02:20:39,290 --> 02:20:43,430
I listened to the wrath of the cons
no less than four times in a row,

5407
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:44,900
the whole five,

5408
02:20:44,901 --> 02:20:46,040
six part series,

5409
02:20:46,310 --> 02:20:47,330
five hours,

5410
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:49,400
and I've heard it no less than four times.

5411
02:20:49,401 --> 02:20:50,960
You talked to Eddie Wong about that.

5412
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:51,490
Yeah,

5413
02:20:51,490 --> 02:20:53,240
but that was a long time ago.

5414
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:54,470
But because you talked about it,

5415
02:20:54,471 --> 02:20:56,660
I started watching it about
the cons and I was like,

5416
02:20:56,800 --> 02:20:57,633
motherfucker,

5417
02:20:57,990 --> 02:20:58,690
dude,

5418
02:20:58,690 --> 02:21:01,170
the podcasts are amazing.

5419
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:05,160
You can get something for free that's
way better than anything you would pay

5420
02:21:05,161 --> 02:21:05,910
for.

5421
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:10,020
I love Opie and Anthony and I love
Jimmy Norton and if it wasn't for them,

5422
02:21:10,021 --> 02:21:11,310
I would cancel serious.

5423
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:12,690
I wouldn't even have it.

5424
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:13,220
I won't even,

5425
02:21:13,220 --> 02:21:14,051
I will say though this,

5426
02:21:14,051 --> 02:21:15,550
and I've said this to Sam and and,

5427
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:17,650
and rolled into the two
guys that worked there.

5428
02:21:17,950 --> 02:21:22,950
I just wish I could get opie and Anthony
and Howard and Howard and Howard and

5429
02:21:23,150 --> 02:21:23,370
Ron,

5430
02:21:23,370 --> 02:21:25,360
any tenant and they to Ron fs.

5431
02:21:25,420 --> 02:21:29,500
I wish I didn't get them on demand the
way I get them on your podcast because

5432
02:21:29,501 --> 02:21:30,430
when I get on a plane and I go,

5433
02:21:30,431 --> 02:21:30,851
shit,

5434
02:21:30,851 --> 02:21:31,910
I forgot to download podcasts,

5435
02:21:31,960 --> 02:21:36,040
I go to Stitcher and I just upload one
and I and I let it load up and then I

5436
02:21:36,041 --> 02:21:37,030
listen for that to take off.

5437
02:21:37,031 --> 02:21:38,380
I usually pass out halfway through.

5438
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:41,140
It's still up there to my list
and I'll listen to the rest of it.

5439
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:43,460
I don't think there's
anything wrong with the way,

5440
02:21:43,461 --> 02:21:47,090
like they say they do it in Howard TV or
anything wrong with the way they do it

5441
02:21:47,091 --> 02:21:48,290
on the opiate Anthony Channel.

5442
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:52,130
But I think they should also do it in
a podcast form where you could download

5443
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:55,310
anyone you want at anytime
you want and they probably do.

5444
02:21:55,311 --> 02:21:56,240
And we're just talking shit.

5445
02:21:56,370 --> 02:21:56,461
No,

5446
02:21:56,461 --> 02:21:57,530
it's on audible.com and,

5447
02:21:57,570 --> 02:21:58,500
and I'm not a big fan.

5448
02:21:58,740 --> 02:21:59,760
You don't like audible?

5449
02:22:00,990 --> 02:22:01,823
I love audible.

5450
02:22:01,830 --> 02:22:03,000
What don't you like about audible?

5451
02:22:03,230 --> 02:22:03,481
Who?

5452
02:22:03,481 --> 02:22:04,314
I Dunno.

5453
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:05,580
Fuck is wrong with you.

5454
02:22:05,590 --> 02:22:06,241
I'm fucking like,

5455
02:22:06,241 --> 02:22:08,240
what if they want to advertise
with me and it's like money.

5456
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:09,750
I'll be real honest with you.

5457
02:22:10,420 --> 02:22:10,740
I don't know.

5458
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:12,550
I got a boat because I
heard it so many times.

5459
02:22:12,551 --> 02:22:13,590
So like this is fucking awesome.

5460
02:22:13,650 --> 02:22:16,320
Greg Fitzsimmons is the
guy I used his login.

5461
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:18,870
It turns out you've got to
buy points to buy the books.

5462
02:22:18,871 --> 02:22:20,070
I don't want to buy the fucking points.

5463
02:22:20,710 --> 02:22:21,450
What are you talking about?

5464
02:22:21,450 --> 02:22:23,120
The way audible worked from?

5465
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:27,090
From from me and then now I'm not talking
a opie and Anthony where you just go

5466
02:22:27,091 --> 02:22:28,230
and you buy like for a dollar.

5467
02:22:28,231 --> 02:22:29,070
You got their episode,

5468
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:34,550
but audible worked where you had to buy
like get 20 it was all on my phone so I

5469
02:22:35,371 --> 02:22:36,510
can only speak from my phone,

5470
02:22:36,511 --> 02:22:37,020
but it was like,

5471
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:37,350
I was like,

5472
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:37,771
fuck,

5473
02:22:37,771 --> 02:22:39,030
I'm going to buy an audible book.

5474
02:22:39,210 --> 02:22:40,200
Greg Fitzsimmons talking about,

5475
02:22:40,201 --> 02:22:42,620
I don't know Greg at all whenever
even met the dude but it,

5476
02:22:42,910 --> 02:22:43,960
but I trusted him.

5477
02:22:43,961 --> 02:22:44,040
He,

5478
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,960
it sounds like actually
listens to fucking books.

5479
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:51,010
So I go and I fucking by the points I go
on and I go to get the audible account

5480
02:22:51,011 --> 02:22:53,760
and I think I'll just go get an
audible account and I'll get it.

5481
02:22:53,910 --> 02:22:54,401
You got to boy,

5482
02:22:54,401 --> 02:22:55,860
let by like 20 points for,

5483
02:22:55,890 --> 02:22:57,600
you can sign in with
your Amazon account too.

5484
02:22:57,601 --> 02:22:59,040
You know I don't have an Amazon account,

5485
02:22:59,041 --> 02:22:59,221
dude.

5486
02:22:59,221 --> 02:22:59,850
I'm not.

5487
02:22:59,850 --> 02:23:01,080
I'm not like super,

5488
02:23:01,400 --> 02:23:01,711
no,

5489
02:23:01,711 --> 02:23:02,790
I don't like super.

5490
02:23:02,791 --> 02:23:03,300
What?

5491
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:05,160
I'm not super technological like that.

5492
02:23:05,370 --> 02:23:06,180
That's so easy though.

5493
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:06,361
I know,

5494
02:23:06,361 --> 02:23:06,991
but Amazon,

5495
02:23:06,991 --> 02:23:07,471
Amazon,

5496
02:23:07,471 --> 02:23:08,400
one click is like,

5497
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:11,400
I've used it on so many sites
that aren't even Amazon sites.

5498
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:13,900
I don't even know what Amazon one click.

5499
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,210
It's not making anything from Amazon.

5500
02:23:15,211 --> 02:23:15,811
I'll tell you right now,

5501
02:23:15,811 --> 02:23:16,740
Amazon is the shit.

5502
02:23:16,770 --> 02:23:18,000
What does am I am grace.

5503
02:23:18,001 --> 02:23:18,690
Amazon.

5504
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:19,440
You know why?

5505
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:20,273
Because there's a lot of,

5506
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:20,700
here's,

5507
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:21,690
here's a perfect example.

5508
02:23:22,470 --> 02:23:23,490
Billiards and pool.

5509
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,740
I play with two different types of cues,

5510
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:29,100
played with a 13 millimeter and sometimes
the 12 and three quarters millimeter

5511
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:32,940
depending on how often I'm playing or
whether or not I don't want to adjust my

5512
02:23:32,941 --> 02:23:33,630
game.

5513
02:23:33,630 --> 02:23:34,740
But when I'm looking at a queue,

5514
02:23:34,741 --> 02:23:37,680
it's very hard to tell the difference
between a 12 and three quarters and the 13

5515
02:23:37,681 --> 02:23:38,220
millimeter.

5516
02:23:38,220 --> 02:23:39,990
So I buy some fucking calipers,

5517
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,950
millimeter calipers and I get them
and then I fit it over the tip.

5518
02:23:43,951 --> 02:23:46,240
And I know exactly what
and then I mark it.

5519
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:48,000
Where the fuck am I going to find that?

5520
02:23:48,001 --> 02:23:52,950
If I'm not going to get it on amazon.com
I get it on amazon.com is 13 seconds.

5521
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:55,620
I type in millimeter Caliper,

5522
02:23:55,621 --> 02:23:56,041
boom.

5523
02:23:56,041 --> 02:23:56,730
One Click,

5524
02:23:56,730 --> 02:23:57,570
yes please.

5525
02:23:58,140 --> 02:23:58,800
Boom,

5526
02:23:58,800 --> 02:23:59,850
it sends to my house.

5527
02:23:59,851 --> 02:24:00,511
I open it,

5528
02:24:00,511 --> 02:24:00,811
boom.

5529
02:24:00,811 --> 02:24:01,650
I now I have it.

5530
02:24:01,651 --> 02:24:03,120
I have these millimeter calipers.

5531
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:06,060
I will never go against
Amazon unless they go evil.

5532
02:24:06,090 --> 02:24:09,630
Unless Amazon becomes a tool of of skynet.

5533
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:11,243
Until then

5534
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:15,740
there is something very powerful
with with that one click like Uber,

5535
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:17,190
Uber,

5536
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:17,811
Uber's Oss.

5537
02:24:17,811 --> 02:24:19,550
I use Uber all the time.

5538
02:24:19,551 --> 02:24:20,750
People don't know what Uber Is.

5539
02:24:20,751 --> 02:24:21,584
I used Uber

5540
02:24:21,610 --> 02:24:23,080
the first time when I was in Manhattan.

5541
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:24,520
It's a credible you.

5542
02:24:24,550 --> 02:24:25,181
It's incredible.

5543
02:24:25,181 --> 02:24:25,840
You can grate it.

5544
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:26,820
You use a,

5545
02:24:26,830 --> 02:24:27,730
it's like a,

5546
02:24:27,910 --> 02:24:30,310
you know like a town car or
limo or something like that.

5547
02:24:30,670 --> 02:24:31,503
More expensive,

5548
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:32,770
more expensive than a taxi,

5549
02:24:32,771 --> 02:24:33,790
but way better.

5550
02:24:34,060 --> 02:24:38,050
And they pick you up and they're gentlemen
and everyone's nice and kind and they

5551
02:24:38,051 --> 02:24:40,030
all want to impress you with like how,

5552
02:24:40,031 --> 02:24:43,600
what a good service Uber is because
the more the better job they do in,

5553
02:24:43,601 --> 02:24:44,261
the nicer they are,

5554
02:24:44,261 --> 02:24:45,094
the more likely you already

5555
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:46,790
use it to there their Yelp,

5556
02:24:46,970 --> 02:24:48,560
it's five star or one star.

5557
02:24:48,590 --> 02:24:53,270
I do gave a dude one star one time because
I ordered an Uber from my parents and

5558
02:24:53,271 --> 02:24:57,570
I was so proud of it and he showed up
in a fucking Celica with food in the his

5559
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:58,370
trunk and I went,

5560
02:24:58,370 --> 02:24:58,780
wow,

5561
02:24:58,780 --> 02:24:58,991
I go,

5562
02:24:58,991 --> 02:24:59,824
you're over.

5563
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:02,630
And apparently there's a new
thing where you can get on Uber.

5564
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:03,950
You don't have to get a town car,

5565
02:25:03,951 --> 02:25:05,030
you can get like a taxis,

5566
02:25:06,020 --> 02:25:09,530
crazy creep driving you around with
his fucking pizza stewing in the trunk.

5567
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:09,741
No,

5568
02:25:09,741 --> 02:25:10,960
you get a town car driver.

5569
02:25:10,961 --> 02:25:12,590
He uses his own car and just drives you.

5570
02:25:12,591 --> 02:25:14,780
There it is for those
people that may not have,

5571
02:25:15,090 --> 02:25:15,440
uh,

5572
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:15,651
not,

5573
02:25:15,651 --> 02:25:16,520
not that I have a ton of money,

5574
02:25:16,521 --> 02:25:19,910
but like for those people that
may not have like a ton of money,

5575
02:25:20,210 --> 02:25:20,710
but it's,

5576
02:25:20,710 --> 02:25:21,110
it's,

5577
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:22,160
it's actually a viable option.

5578
02:25:22,161 --> 02:25:23,000
It's a little sketchy if you're a,

5579
02:25:23,330 --> 02:25:23,921
if you're a dude,

5580
02:25:23,921 --> 02:25:24,040
it's

5581
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:24,873
not a bad deal.

5582
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:27,180
But Celica a little bit of like,

5583
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:28,960
I sound like I just used that name,

5584
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:29,860
whatever the fuck it was,

5585
02:25:29,861 --> 02:25:30,970
Sonata or something.

5586
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:32,883
Come on Joe.

5587
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:34,690
You to pick apart by stories.

5588
02:25:35,010 --> 02:25:39,400
Funny thing though that you have to look
at check as to really worry for a dude.

5589
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:40,361
You know a dude,

5590
02:25:40,361 --> 02:25:41,021
it's sketchy,

5591
02:25:41,021 --> 02:25:45,730
but it's like no one's trying to fuck
you on the normal oh fuck dude into your

5592
02:25:45,731 --> 02:25:46,400
house.

5593
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:47,140
Oh yeah.

5594
02:25:47,140 --> 02:25:47,973
With the premise,

5595
02:25:48,270 --> 02:25:49,300
I want to fuck,

5596
02:25:50,140 --> 02:25:51,310
let's just have fun.

5597
02:25:51,430 --> 02:25:52,560
This is where I live.

5598
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:54,370
Spend the night here while,

5599
02:25:54,371 --> 02:25:56,680
and assuming that the
dude is not a Dickhead,

5600
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:59,530
assuming the dude is not going to
do something horrible and you know,

5601
02:26:00,310 --> 02:26:01,143
that's uh,

5602
02:26:01,630 --> 02:26:02,181
being a woman,

5603
02:26:02,181 --> 02:26:03,100
that's got to be way harder.

5604
02:26:03,101 --> 02:26:05,320
When you hear shit about
this kidnapping thing,

5605
02:26:05,470 --> 02:26:07,710
he never heard about a guy
getting kidnapped for 10 years,

5606
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:09,380
forced him to fuck some check little boy.

5607
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:11,410
So Adam Walsh.

5608
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:13,160
Yeah,

5609
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:15,120
by Dude's kidnapped by dudes.

5610
02:26:15,121 --> 02:26:16,240
So not kidnapped by women.

5611
02:26:16,290 --> 02:26:17,140
That's what my point is.

5612
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:18,910
It's way harder to be a woman,

5613
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:19,661
you know,

5614
02:26:19,661 --> 02:26:20,980
and to deal with men.

5615
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:24,070
Men are creeps that creeps demand
and they're creeps to women.

5616
02:26:24,071 --> 02:26:24,904
Sometimes.

5617
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:27,670
That is the number one
issue with our world.

5618
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:29,333
Conti men.

5619
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:32,740
If we could cut cunty men
like Morrissey once said,

5620
02:26:33,070 --> 02:26:34,270
it's a really annoying thing.

5621
02:26:34,271 --> 02:26:35,410
I've talked about it on say,

5622
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:36,930
I love saying that once.

5623
02:26:37,270 --> 02:26:38,740
That's a great way to start a quote.

5624
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:39,970
I even have a joke about it.

5625
02:26:40,150 --> 02:26:40,721
He said that,

5626
02:26:40,721 --> 02:26:41,060
uh,

5627
02:26:41,060 --> 02:26:42,400
that gay,

5628
02:26:42,460 --> 02:26:42,681
uh,

5629
02:26:42,681 --> 02:26:42,970
if,

5630
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:43,121
uh,

5631
02:26:43,121 --> 02:26:43,931
fall people were gay,

5632
02:26:43,931 --> 02:26:45,100
there wouldn't be any war.

5633
02:26:45,650 --> 02:26:46,990
It's like people look at it,

5634
02:26:46,991 --> 02:26:49,030
things like that because
they think that it's,

5635
02:26:49,031 --> 02:26:49,390
but it's,

5636
02:26:49,390 --> 02:26:51,130
it has nothing to do with heterosexuality.

5637
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:52,060
Nothing or,

5638
02:26:52,061 --> 02:26:52,900
and the contempt is,

5639
02:26:52,901 --> 02:26:55,100
theater has nothing to
do with heterosexual,

5640
02:26:55,570 --> 02:26:57,460
but it does have to do with men.

5641
02:26:57,790 --> 02:26:59,770
It has to do with asshole men.

5642
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:03,970
But it doesn't mean that all
men are assholes and that's
where things get weird.

5643
02:27:03,971 --> 02:27:08,860
Like I got in this dispute with
a bunch of feminists and uh,

5644
02:27:08,861 --> 02:27:13,650
one of the things that I said I was
making fun of male feminists because uh,

5645
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:15,730
there's a lot of male
feminists that I always,

5646
02:27:15,970 --> 02:27:20,970
I liken them to vampire familiars so
if they just trying to get close to the

5647
02:27:21,020 --> 02:27:21,250
WWE,

5648
02:27:21,250 --> 02:27:22,050
they just,

5649
02:27:22,050 --> 02:27:23,620
they don't have any appeal with women.

5650
02:27:23,621 --> 02:27:24,190
So they like,

5651
02:27:24,190 --> 02:27:29,190
they change who they are and adopt for
what like really powerful women want won

5652
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:33,760
his battle with you because I
saw that go down on Twitter.

5653
02:27:33,761 --> 02:27:38,170
But the truth is did you not
live enough of a life of a man?

5654
02:27:38,390 --> 02:27:39,580
Like as a man where you,

5655
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:40,900
at one point you start saying,

5656
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:44,410
I'm very empathetic to all women's rights.

5657
02:27:44,410 --> 02:27:45,880
I have two daughters and a wife.

5658
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:47,890
All my animals are female.

5659
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:50,230
But like I did grow up a boy.

5660
02:27:50,290 --> 02:27:53,320
I was a boy in my whole fucking
life and I felt what that felt like.

5661
02:27:53,321 --> 02:27:57,400
And I will always identify with being
a man first and not a woman first.

5662
02:27:57,401 --> 02:28:00,700
There are some guys that almost identify
with women before they identify with

5663
02:28:00,701 --> 02:28:01,390
men.

5664
02:28:01,390 --> 02:28:02,010
Yeah,

5665
02:28:02,010 --> 02:28:02,940
like I,

5666
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:05,410
well there's a lot of gender traders,

5667
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:08,410
both on the female side
and on the men's side.

5668
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:10,900
All these feminist identify
with being a women woman.

5669
02:28:11,230 --> 02:28:11,890
You're going,

5670
02:28:11,890 --> 02:28:15,610
me to a gal that I was
dating once said to me,

5671
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:16,750
never trust a girl,

5672
02:28:16,751 --> 02:28:18,160
doesn't have any girlfriends.

5673
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:19,391
And I said,

5674
02:28:19,391 --> 02:28:20,224
why do you say that?

5675
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:21,261
And she goes,

5676
02:28:21,261 --> 02:28:22,094
because,

5677
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:22,700
okay,

5678
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:25,250
every girl knows that
guys want to fuck them.

5679
02:28:25,251 --> 02:28:25,970
Right?

5680
02:28:25,970 --> 02:28:26,301
And I go,

5681
02:28:26,301 --> 02:28:26,960
yeah.

5682
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:27,590
And I go,

5683
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:29,060
and the girls don't want to fuck it.

5684
02:28:29,061 --> 02:28:29,540
Right?

5685
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:30,051
And she goes,

5686
02:28:30,051 --> 02:28:30,410
yeah.

5687
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:31,010
She goes,

5688
02:28:31,010 --> 02:28:31,131
well,

5689
02:28:31,131 --> 02:28:32,120
how come they don't like you?

5690
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:35,810
Girls don't like that girl.

5691
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:37,280
She doesn't have any girlfriends.

5692
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:39,260
So it's one or two things have happened.

5693
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:44,030
Either you just moved into town or
you fucked everybody's boyfriend.

5694
02:28:44,570 --> 02:28:45,403
Shit.

5695
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:46,640
And I just looked at,

5696
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:46,940
I'm like,

5697
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:48,080
this bitch is too smart for me.

5698
02:28:52,860 --> 02:28:53,693
I'm an eight,

5699
02:28:55,080 --> 02:28:58,310
at least 18% more chimpanzees and dude,

5700
02:28:58,330 --> 02:28:59,310
I've got to get outta here.

5701
02:29:02,010 --> 02:29:02,491
Fuck you.

5702
02:29:02,491 --> 02:29:03,500
I'm a kissing on the cheek,

5703
02:29:03,501 --> 02:29:04,050
Ma.

5704
02:29:04,050 --> 02:29:04,950
And then the other chick,

5705
02:29:04,951 --> 02:29:05,490
Ma,

5706
02:29:05,490 --> 02:29:06,091
don't hit me.

5707
02:29:06,091 --> 02:29:06,924
I got to go.

5708
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:11,460
That should be a short series
Joe Rogan's defining moments

5709
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:14,640
a moment like that.

5710
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:15,541
That was a good one.

5711
02:29:15,541 --> 02:29:18,060
Man dropped some serious knowledge on me.

5712
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:20,130
She dropped some serious knowledge on me.

5713
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:22,920
She looked me in the eyes
when she said it too.

5714
02:29:22,921 --> 02:29:24,390
It's like a really strong move.

5715
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:25,150
She goes,

5716
02:29:25,150 --> 02:29:27,340
don't ever trust a girl who
doesn't have any girlfriends.

5717
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:30,470
And I remember I seen him cause I,

5718
02:29:30,471 --> 02:29:32,140
I remember saying to our goal,

5719
02:29:32,410 --> 02:29:35,620
I was like cocky because I was
like 24 when she said this.

5720
02:29:36,010 --> 02:29:36,401
And I was like,

5721
02:29:36,401 --> 02:29:36,731
why?

5722
02:29:36,731 --> 02:29:38,220
What the fuck you is say,

5723
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:38,441
you know,

5724
02:29:38,441 --> 02:29:39,090
what about,

5725
02:29:39,090 --> 02:29:39,281
you know,

5726
02:29:39,281 --> 02:29:41,020
some girls are assholes and,

5727
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:42,250
and then I just,

5728
02:29:42,460 --> 02:29:42,880
you know,

5729
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:43,420
when she,

5730
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:44,380
after she said that,

5731
02:29:44,410 --> 02:29:45,243
she's like,

5732
02:29:45,460 --> 02:29:48,430
the girls know who you are,

5733
02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:49,413
they know who you are.

5734
02:29:49,900 --> 02:29:50,471
And I just went,

5735
02:29:50,471 --> 02:29:51,280
wow,

5736
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:52,330
I can't even argue with you.

5737
02:29:52,770 --> 02:29:53,603
Um,

5738
02:29:54,750 --> 02:29:58,020
the only equivalent I have to that,

5739
02:29:58,170 --> 02:30:00,210
and I hate to use his
name twice in one podcast,

5740
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:02,130
Anthony Bordain put trees.

5741
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,090
I fucking wish I chased it.

5742
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:06,340
Beautiful.

5743
02:30:06,340 --> 02:30:07,860
Marjorie said to me one night here,

5744
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:11,070
the phone talking to his black dude and
we're sitting in the bag of then blow

5745
02:30:11,071 --> 02:30:11,861
the Boston comedy club.

5746
02:30:11,861 --> 02:30:12,511
We're sitting down,

5747
02:30:12,511 --> 02:30:15,000
there's a bench in the corner
by the window and we're sitting,

5748
02:30:15,001 --> 02:30:15,360
talking,

5749
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:18,150
we're sitting talking and he's watching
me the whole time and I just recently

5750
02:30:18,151 --> 02:30:19,770
tried to just grow a
beard for the first time.

5751
02:30:20,370 --> 02:30:21,320
And uh,

5752
02:30:21,750 --> 02:30:22,290
we get up,

5753
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:23,880
the guy gets up and he moves.

5754
02:30:23,940 --> 02:30:26,670
Patrice sits down next to me was
the fuck you doing talking to him.

5755
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:27,391
I said,

5756
02:30:27,391 --> 02:30:27,771
what you have?

5757
02:30:27,771 --> 02:30:29,970
Don't ever talk to a black man
that doesn't have facial hair?

5758
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:33,250
What's this have to do with it?

5759
02:30:33,251 --> 02:30:33,551
And he goes,

5760
02:30:33,551 --> 02:30:34,384
no man,

5761
02:30:34,710 --> 02:30:35,543
fuck you.

5762
02:30:35,560 --> 02:30:36,400
Any black man

5763
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:39,670
has a facial hair.

5764
02:30:39,671 --> 02:30:40,504
We grew up

5765
02:30:41,410 --> 02:30:42,480
so hilarious.

5766
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:43,190
Fucking great.

5767
02:30:43,190 --> 02:30:45,640
And then I started bombing
around in every black dude.

5768
02:30:45,641 --> 02:30:47,320
I knew how to facial hair.

5769
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:49,690
It was like the greatest little fucking.

5770
02:30:49,950 --> 02:30:50,351
Meanwhile,

5771
02:30:50,351 --> 02:30:50,820
Patrice

5772
02:30:50,820 --> 02:30:51,920
didn't even believe that.

5773
02:30:51,921 --> 02:30:53,540
He was only saying that
because it was the funny thing.

5774
02:30:53,900 --> 02:30:54,980
It was a bug with me.

5775
02:30:55,050 --> 02:30:56,300
And at the same time he goes,

5776
02:30:56,770 --> 02:30:59,930
you got to learn how to trim your
lip because I was white guys,

5777
02:30:59,931 --> 02:31:02,270
we'll let the hair grow into their
lip and black guys don't do that.

5778
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:03,560
Dates up on the lip.

5779
02:31:03,970 --> 02:31:05,050
Patrice and I had,

5780
02:31:05,190 --> 02:31:05,410
uh,

5781
02:31:05,410 --> 02:31:06,790
a couple of cool moments,

5782
02:31:06,791 --> 02:31:08,860
but one of the coolest ones
was I wasn't even in the room.

5783
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:13,390
I called up opie and Anthony
and a w it was Louis and,

5784
02:31:13,410 --> 02:31:13,440
uh,

5785
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:14,730
Patrice and uh,

5786
02:31:14,820 --> 02:31:17,950
Anthony and opie and Anthony
was talking about guns.

5787
02:31:17,951 --> 02:31:19,410
Like we're talking about guns and he's,

5788
02:31:19,411 --> 02:31:19,561
he,

5789
02:31:19,561 --> 02:31:22,320
he worries always about about being
attacked and all this different.

5790
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:23,040
And I go,

5791
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:25,770
don't you worry that like maybe your,

5792
02:31:25,780 --> 02:31:29,010
your manifesting this
with you with your own.

5793
02:31:29,011 --> 02:31:31,800
Like if you have reality and
you're all focus on that,

5794
02:31:31,801 --> 02:31:35,040
you're manifesting an attack
and that Patrice goes on.

5795
02:31:35,041 --> 02:31:37,860
Joe Rogan see Joe Rogan knows about magic.

5796
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:42,030
And I remember just
laughing and I was like,

5797
02:31:42,031 --> 02:31:42,361
man,

5798
02:31:42,361 --> 02:31:45,030
I can't believe Patrice is
goofing on what I just said.

5799
02:31:45,031 --> 02:31:45,841
This is beautiful.

5800
02:31:45,841 --> 02:31:46,674
It's an honor.

5801
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:47,311
You know what I mean?

5802
02:31:47,311 --> 02:31:47,790
It was,

5803
02:31:47,790 --> 02:31:48,623
it was a it,

5804
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:49,533
it's like,

5805
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:50,640
I dunno,

5806
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,080
I missed the fuck out of that dude.

5807
02:31:52,410 --> 02:31:53,031
I remember,

5808
02:31:53,031 --> 02:31:54,950
I got to tell you where I
was when I found out he died.

5809
02:31:56,520 --> 02:31:57,353
He was a fucking,

5810
02:31:57,360 --> 02:31:58,500
he was a solid dude,

5811
02:31:58,501 --> 02:31:58,950
man.

5812
02:31:58,950 --> 02:31:59,940
I remember where it was.

5813
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:00,931
Oh,

5814
02:32:00,931 --> 02:32:01,540
is that the,

5815
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:02,373
um,

5816
02:32:04,460 --> 02:32:06,290
I was at Rusty's a dog,

5817
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:08,960
a dog store and Jura,

5818
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:12,680
and I was going in to buy food for my dog
and frosty called me up and he's like,

5819
02:32:12,950 --> 02:32:13,670
trees died.

5820
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:14,503
And I was like,

5821
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:16,160
it was like knocked the wind out of me.

5822
02:32:16,370 --> 02:32:17,203
So,

5823
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:18,020
uh,

5824
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:19,700
so I'm in the car with Leanne,

5825
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:21,530
my wife is in the car and I get in and,

5826
02:32:21,531 --> 02:32:22,310
um,

5827
02:32:22,310 --> 02:32:22,461
uh,

5828
02:32:22,461 --> 02:32:23,740
visibly upset and,

5829
02:32:24,010 --> 02:32:24,680
and,

5830
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:25,170
and,

5831
02:32:25,170 --> 02:32:25,781
and just like,

5832
02:32:25,781 --> 02:32:26,601
are you going to go to the funeral?

5833
02:32:26,601 --> 02:32:27,080
And I was like,

5834
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:28,040
I don't want to go to the fucking funeral.

5835
02:32:28,550 --> 02:32:32,120
Only because all I could hear if I was
at Patrice a funeral is Patrice laughing.

5836
02:32:32,121 --> 02:32:32,330
One,

5837
02:32:32,330 --> 02:32:33,163
I wouldn't go to years,

5838
02:32:33,190 --> 02:32:34,023
motherfucker.

5839
02:32:36,230 --> 02:32:37,063
So I was like,

5840
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:37,730
I then,

5841
02:32:37,730 --> 02:32:38,330
uh,

5842
02:32:38,330 --> 02:32:40,970
and I fucking started
crying and my wife was like,

5843
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:41,833
what the fuck?

5844
02:32:41,870 --> 02:32:42,590
Like

5845
02:32:42,590 --> 02:32:43,310
I cried.

5846
02:32:43,310 --> 02:32:44,690
I've cried for a few guys.

5847
02:32:45,350 --> 02:32:46,183
Yeah.

5848
02:32:46,820 --> 02:32:47,810
Do I said what the fuck?

5849
02:32:47,870 --> 02:32:48,390
Yeah.

5850
02:32:48,390 --> 02:32:49,223
Cause she was like,

5851
02:32:49,250 --> 02:32:49,491
she said,

5852
02:32:49,491 --> 02:32:50,700
go to the funeral to the funeral food,

5853
02:32:50,730 --> 02:32:51,201
this upset.

5854
02:32:51,201 --> 02:32:51,710
And I was like,

5855
02:32:51,710 --> 02:32:52,041
I go,

5856
02:32:52,041 --> 02:32:52,370
no,

5857
02:32:52,370 --> 02:32:53,780
because there's no way explained to trees,

5858
02:32:53,781 --> 02:32:55,010
to a woman to go,

5859
02:32:55,120 --> 02:32:55,430
well,

5860
02:32:55,430 --> 02:32:55,960
you know,

5861
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:57,770
to explain to my wife you could.

5862
02:32:57,771 --> 02:32:58,604
He's mean,

5863
02:32:58,820 --> 02:32:59,270
it's like,

5864
02:32:59,270 --> 02:33:01,040
how do you expand Oprah to a dude?

5865
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:02,513
It's enough.

5866
02:33:03,710 --> 02:33:04,490
Um,

5867
02:33:04,490 --> 02:33:06,400
I cried for Freddy a soda.

5868
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:07,580
I,

5869
02:33:07,580 --> 02:33:08,413
my,

5870
02:33:08,790 --> 02:33:09,950
I was a hard one man.

5871
02:33:09,951 --> 02:33:10,784
I was with my,

5872
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:16,730
if you don't know if Freddy Soto
was Freddy Soto is a lost treasure.

5873
02:33:17,090 --> 02:33:20,810
This is a few guys that I've met
in my life and had like this,

5874
02:33:21,290 --> 02:33:26,290
this really undeniable charisma where
like if I knew that he was going to be

5875
02:33:27,381 --> 02:33:28,214
performing,

5876
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:28,790
I would,

5877
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:29,361
I would find,

5878
02:33:29,361 --> 02:33:29,571
you know,

5879
02:33:29,571 --> 02:33:30,440
we were outside,

5880
02:33:30,470 --> 02:33:32,960
like the comedy store was
a weird place where like,

5881
02:33:33,170 --> 02:33:33,411
you know,

5882
02:33:33,411 --> 02:33:37,190
sometimes a guy would be on stage and
you'd like the guy but he didn't want to

5883
02:33:37,191 --> 02:33:37,970
watch.

5884
02:33:37,970 --> 02:33:39,290
But Freddy,

5885
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:40,610
I would go in,

5886
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:42,200
I mean I wouldn't watch all of his sets.

5887
02:33:42,230 --> 02:33:43,280
I didn't watch anybody.

5888
02:33:43,310 --> 02:33:46,610
All of their sites cause it was too
fun to be outside in the parking lot.

5889
02:33:46,790 --> 02:33:49,910
But there was a lot of guys who are going
every few months to see what's going

5890
02:33:49,911 --> 02:33:50,270
on,

5891
02:33:50,270 --> 02:33:51,320
see what's going on with Freddy.

5892
02:33:51,530 --> 02:33:53,030
And Freddy always had something going on.

5893
02:33:53,031 --> 02:33:54,650
He was always on some new angle.

5894
02:33:54,890 --> 02:33:58,160
He was always a developing his delivery.

5895
02:33:58,161 --> 02:33:59,810
He was always getting a little sharper.

5896
02:34:00,250 --> 02:34:01,200
He's just had a,

5897
02:34:01,210 --> 02:34:06,210
a beautiful presence like on stage and
knowing the dude from like real life.

5898
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:10,460
We're all a fraternity of Weirdos,

5899
02:34:10,461 --> 02:34:11,180
man.

5900
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:11,720
You know,

5901
02:34:11,720 --> 02:34:16,720
like standup comedians or if you the
worst torture ever for standup comedian

5902
02:34:17,981 --> 02:34:20,770
would be no comedians for
the rest of your life.

5903
02:34:21,310 --> 02:34:22,540
Only accountants.

5904
02:34:23,710 --> 02:34:25,810
Only accountants and lawyers forever.

5905
02:34:25,850 --> 02:34:26,270
Do you know who?

5906
02:34:26,270 --> 02:34:26,891
No kidding.

5907
02:34:26,891 --> 02:34:29,740
Just see the number and there's a lot of
cool ass accountants and there's a lot

5908
02:34:29,741 --> 02:34:30,790
of cool ass lawyers.

5909
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:36,030
But what are the odds that you run on
to one of them most likely going to run

5910
02:34:36,941 --> 02:34:38,680
into a non cool last accountant,

5911
02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:39,801
horror,

5912
02:34:39,801 --> 02:34:41,110
boring ass fucking lawyer.

5913
02:34:41,111 --> 02:34:42,280
And you're going to get trapped.

5914
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:43,573
A lot of people to go,

5915
02:34:43,830 --> 02:34:44,910
whoa buddy.

5916
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:45,943
Yeah.

5917
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:47,300
But if I saw Freddy Loc card,

5918
02:34:47,301 --> 02:34:48,380
we could be in Alaska.

5919
02:34:48,980 --> 02:34:49,341
You know,

5920
02:34:49,341 --> 02:34:51,080
I could run into that dude
in the middle of the woods.

5921
02:34:51,081 --> 02:34:51,291
I'm like,

5922
02:34:51,291 --> 02:34:51,681
Freddy,

5923
02:34:51,681 --> 02:34:52,880
what the fuck man?

5924
02:34:53,370 --> 02:34:53,710
We'd,

5925
02:34:53,710 --> 02:34:56,060
we'd hug each other and
then we would be together.

5926
02:34:56,061 --> 02:34:57,140
He wasn't going anywhere.

5927
02:34:57,141 --> 02:34:57,750
I wasn't going.

5928
02:34:57,750 --> 02:34:58,491
I wasn't going anywhere.

5929
02:34:58,491 --> 02:34:59,324
He wasn't going.

5930
02:34:59,470 --> 02:35:00,030
Nope.

5931
02:35:00,030 --> 02:35:01,530
Freddy Soto had the joke.

5932
02:35:01,531 --> 02:35:02,310
Uh,

5933
02:35:02,310 --> 02:35:03,143
um,

5934
02:35:03,210 --> 02:35:05,220
I fucking loved about his dad.

5935
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:06,860
A lot of great,

5936
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:09,361
his joke,

5937
02:35:09,361 --> 02:35:09,600
joke,

5938
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:13,050
Freddy Loc or Freddy Soto had
a joke about his dad going,

5939
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:13,320
uh,

5940
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:15,980
it's the word that everyone
misused that he'd go,

5941
02:35:15,981 --> 02:35:16,140
uh,

5942
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:16,440
eras,

5943
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:17,190
eras.

5944
02:35:17,190 --> 02:35:18,020
It regardless,

5945
02:35:18,020 --> 02:35:18,780
regardless,

5946
02:35:18,780 --> 02:35:19,350
regardless.

5947
02:35:19,350 --> 02:35:20,280
Grabbed the fucking,

5948
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:20,761
like,

5949
02:35:20,761 --> 02:35:22,300
it's so funny because you know,

5950
02:35:22,470 --> 02:35:24,240
that could be written off as like,

5951
02:35:24,570 --> 02:35:24,691
oh,

5952
02:35:24,691 --> 02:35:26,430
that's what it's like to
be a young Mexican man.

5953
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:26,881
But it's not,

5954
02:35:26,881 --> 02:35:27,120
it's like,

5955
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:28,350
it's what it seems to be a young man,

5956
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:29,131
the young man,

5957
02:35:29,131 --> 02:35:30,960
and you just saw it painted in his colors.

5958
02:35:31,170 --> 02:35:32,730
But I dealt with that with my dad.

5959
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:36,060
But in the same way of your dad
being wrong and it was so beautiful.

5960
02:35:36,061 --> 02:35:37,200
Such a beautiful joke.

5961
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:37,561
Yeah.

5962
02:35:37,561 --> 02:35:38,970
That was where it connected.

5963
02:35:38,971 --> 02:35:39,151
I mean,

5964
02:35:39,151 --> 02:35:42,870
that's where bill Cosby stuff connected
with a lot of white people back when

5965
02:35:42,871 --> 02:35:44,790
people weren't listening
to the black people talk.

5966
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:46,800
That's really what it was.

5967
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:48,630
It's just that he,

5968
02:35:48,631 --> 02:35:50,600
he hit a note that Edd,

5969
02:35:50,630 --> 02:35:51,620
it was universal.

5970
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:52,030
Yeah.

5971
02:35:52,030 --> 02:35:52,371
You know,

5972
02:35:52,371 --> 02:35:53,870
and what you saw was,

5973
02:35:54,380 --> 02:35:54,741
hey look,

5974
02:35:54,741 --> 02:35:55,790
we all grew up.

5975
02:35:56,120 --> 02:35:59,240
I mean everybody grew up
either everybody's alive today,

5976
02:35:59,241 --> 02:36:04,241
either grew up in pushing it as the
forties it's the fifties sixties seventies

5977
02:36:07,070 --> 02:36:08,360
eighties nineties and
two thousands that's it.

5978
02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:11,360
And most likely the older you are,

5979
02:36:11,870 --> 02:36:12,920
most likely the older,

5980
02:36:13,010 --> 02:36:14,030
the older you are,

5981
02:36:14,031 --> 02:36:16,060
the dumb or your parents
were when they raised here.

5982
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:16,850
Yeah.

5983
02:36:16,850 --> 02:36:18,400
Because people were just dumb or them.

5984
02:36:18,470 --> 02:36:19,730
And you can't blame them.

5985
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:20,930
They grew,

5986
02:36:21,170 --> 02:36:24,620
we imitate our atmosphere and
we adapt to our environment.

5987
02:36:24,621 --> 02:36:28,970
And if we grow up in a place where no
one knows what the fuck is going on,

5988
02:36:28,971 --> 02:36:30,230
it's easy to lie.

5989
02:36:30,590 --> 02:36:33,830
You have your family's caught up in
religious calls and the other half of your

5990
02:36:33,831 --> 02:36:35,570
family is fucking crazy.

5991
02:36:35,571 --> 02:36:38,150
And who knows how to live this life.

5992
02:36:38,150 --> 02:36:38,691
Who knows,

5993
02:36:38,691 --> 02:36:40,940
who knows what they're the
correct way to go about it.

5994
02:36:41,150 --> 02:36:43,760
Not enough information is
being exchanged back and forth,

5995
02:36:43,970 --> 02:36:48,230
which in the forties fifties sixties
seventies 80s and nineties it's not until

5996
02:36:48,231 --> 02:36:50,870
the two thousands come along that people
start like looking around and going,

5997
02:36:51,080 --> 02:36:52,220
what's happening here?

5998
02:36:52,490 --> 02:36:54,320
This is a brief moment in history,

5999
02:36:54,321 --> 02:36:54,651
man.

6000
02:36:54,651 --> 02:36:55,150
It's uh,

6001
02:36:55,150 --> 02:37:00,150
a couple of decades where at least
we're trying to make sense of things.

6002
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:04,580
There was no effort to try to make sense
of things in the 60s and the 50s they

6003
02:37:04,581 --> 02:37:05,810
didn't have the resources,

6004
02:37:05,990 --> 02:37:07,220
they didn't have the access.

6005
02:37:07,370 --> 02:37:11,120
Occasionally you got groups like the
Communist Party would come along and all

6006
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:12,241
they would do,

6007
02:37:12,241 --> 02:37:14,600
they would propose an
alternative way of life.

6008
02:37:14,750 --> 02:37:15,140
And then a,

6009
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:17,590
like Joseph McCarthy would
come along and arrest anybody,

6010
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:21,500
went to meetings and then everybody
abandoned all that shit at a fear.

6011
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:23,490
And then we move on to the,

6012
02:37:23,491 --> 02:37:24,320
the next stage.

6013
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:29,320
And then the 60s someone came along with
acid and the acid came along and all of

6014
02:37:29,361 --> 02:37:30,470
a sudden for the first time,

6015
02:37:30,471 --> 02:37:33,020
so people grew up with
some bullshit buddy Holly,

6016
02:37:33,410 --> 02:37:34,243
you know,

6017
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:39,620
than done the nonsense music of the 1950s
were indoctrinated into the world of

6018
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:42,710
psychedelic drugs.

6019
02:37:43,250 --> 02:37:44,210
And then that changed.

6020
02:37:44,300 --> 02:37:46,160
So that was the first wave of information.

6021
02:37:46,161 --> 02:37:48,010
The first wave of information
wasn't the Internet.

6022
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:48,920
It wasn't even books.

6023
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:50,360
It was psychedelics.

6024
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:51,021
Psychedelics.

6025
02:37:51,021 --> 02:37:51,854
After books,

6026
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:57,020
books laid a foundation and then in
the late fifties early sixties Albert

6027
02:37:57,020 --> 02:37:59,780
Hoffman came along and boom,

6028
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:03,950
and the universe gave the human beings
a big kiss on the lips and then all of a

6029
02:38:03,951 --> 02:38:04,251
sudden,

6030
02:38:04,251 --> 02:38:04,701
boom,

6031
02:38:04,701 --> 02:38:07,400
we blossom with unique
ideas and the Western world,

6032
02:38:07,401 --> 02:38:12,401
the height of intellectual debate and
stimulation was introduced to the most

6033
02:38:14,241 --> 02:38:16,400
powerful psychedelic drugs known to man.

6034
02:38:16,401 --> 02:38:19,010
And it all branched out
and flooded from there.

6035
02:38:19,190 --> 02:38:22,910
And then from those came the
very idea of the Internet.

6036
02:38:23,330 --> 02:38:27,860
How many people that that did that
created the Internet didn't smoke weed?

6037
02:38:28,220 --> 02:38:30,050
How many of them hadn't tried mushrooms?

6038
02:38:30,051 --> 02:38:31,340
How many of them never tried it?

6039
02:38:31,670 --> 02:38:32,330
Man,

6040
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:34,280
the Internet without you might be able to.

6041
02:38:34,310 --> 02:38:35,060
I don't know.

6042
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:36,470
I don't know how your brain works.

6043
02:38:36,530 --> 02:38:37,221
I don't know how you can,

6044
02:38:37,221 --> 02:38:38,630
do you know who you are?

6045
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:39,130
I don't.

6046
02:38:39,130 --> 02:38:40,700
I you don't know how to do who I am.

6047
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:42,350
Can you imagine if you
had to be me for a day?

6048
02:38:42,351 --> 02:38:44,630
Whether or not you would do
it without fucking it up.

6049
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:45,890
I couldn't be you for a day.

6050
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:48,140
If I came home and I tried to be
you and your wife would be like,

6051
02:38:48,141 --> 02:38:49,670
what the fuck is wrong with you Bert?

6052
02:38:50,250 --> 02:38:51,760
Is she checking for Robbie?

6053
02:38:54,420 --> 02:38:54,910
I was like,

6054
02:38:54,910 --> 02:38:55,150
go.

6055
02:38:55,150 --> 02:38:55,421
Okay,

6056
02:38:55,421 --> 02:38:56,450
what we'll do,

6057
02:38:58,120 --> 02:38:59,050
we'll it Burt too.

6058
02:39:01,810 --> 02:39:02,860
It's not that easy.

6059
02:39:03,430 --> 02:39:04,181
I could not be you.

6060
02:39:04,181 --> 02:39:06,010
You could be me in a heartbeat.

6061
02:39:06,190 --> 02:39:06,410
No,

6062
02:39:06,410 --> 02:39:07,243
he's saying that

6063
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:08,711
now.

6064
02:39:08,711 --> 02:39:09,760
You say that that's not true.

6065
02:39:10,300 --> 02:39:11,670
I could never be painting.

6066
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:13,540
I can never be my sister.

6067
02:39:13,541 --> 02:39:14,170
I can never,

6068
02:39:14,170 --> 02:39:18,070
it doesn't mean that each
individual unit is like,

6069
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:20,530
it's more or less effective.

6070
02:39:20,620 --> 02:39:23,380
It's like I would be less
effective at being Bert.

6071
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:25,150
You know what I'm saying?

6072
02:39:25,150 --> 02:39:25,983
Like

6073
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:27,020
I see what you're saying,

6074
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:31,660
but like I definitely like if like
if it was like freaky Friday and we

6075
02:39:31,810 --> 02:39:34,050
[inaudible] wife swap,

6076
02:39:35,830 --> 02:39:36,663
I would be like,

6077
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:37,753
I'd be like,

6078
02:39:38,660 --> 02:39:39,493
I would be,

6079
02:39:40,420 --> 02:39:44,390
I would be the mom who got the
child's body as opposed to the child.

6080
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:50,600
Like in the Lindsay Lohan,

6081
02:39:50,630 --> 02:39:51,170
Jamie,

6082
02:39:51,170 --> 02:39:52,003
Jamie,

6083
02:39:52,730 --> 02:39:53,810
Jamie Curtis movie.

6084
02:39:53,930 --> 02:39:57,220
There was a movie with Lindsay
Lohan and Jamie Curtis who was like,

6085
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:05,960
Lindsay Lohan learned a lot,

6086
02:40:05,961 --> 02:40:06,860
but she not fun.

6087
02:40:06,890 --> 02:40:10,010
Jamie Curtis have fun
but did end learn a lot.

6088
02:40:10,011 --> 02:40:10,791
They both learned a lot.

6089
02:40:10,791 --> 02:40:12,290
I guess that's the point
of the fucking movie,

6090
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:14,063
Curtis.

6091
02:40:14,610 --> 02:40:15,443
Okay.

6092
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:18,420
I'm looking for that is ridiculous.

6093
02:40:18,660 --> 02:40:22,140
I want to have Jamie Lee Curtis like gets
mad when the pizza delivery guy asked

6094
02:40:22,141 --> 02:40:22,974
her about that.

6095
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:24,113
Holy Shit.

6096
02:40:24,510 --> 02:40:25,440
Freaky Friday.

6097
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:27,210
You did freaky Friday.

6098
02:40:28,230 --> 02:40:29,011
It's like bitch,

6099
02:40:29,011 --> 02:40:32,580
I did the original Halloween
fucking freaky Friday.

6100
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:33,241
She,

6101
02:40:33,241 --> 02:40:34,020
uh,

6102
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:34,741
we had,

6103
02:40:34,741 --> 02:40:35,310
um,

6104
02:40:35,310 --> 02:40:37,560
you know the rumors about her
that she's a hermaphrodite.

6105
02:40:37,590 --> 02:40:37,831
Yeah.

6106
02:40:37,831 --> 02:40:38,850
What's that rumor about?

6107
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:39,990
A douchey rumor?

6108
02:40:40,050 --> 02:40:40,440
Sweet.

6109
02:40:40,440 --> 02:40:41,131
So I had,

6110
02:40:41,131 --> 02:40:44,310
I did a show for comedy central long
time ago called buzz where we'd,

6111
02:40:44,420 --> 02:40:45,960
it was Ben Bailey show cash cab,

6112
02:40:45,961 --> 02:40:46,794
but with drunk people.

6113
02:40:46,840 --> 02:40:50,250
So pay people about three toms Grover
was the head writer and I picked people

6114
02:40:50,251 --> 02:40:54,450
off the street and then we play a game
show in the back of a van and a randomly,

6115
02:40:54,451 --> 02:40:57,390
last group we got was a bunch of like
three dudes that were fucking hammered.

6116
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:00,690
The mount you blew into the
breathalyzer was your bank.

6117
02:41:00,750 --> 02:41:03,180
So if you blew the dude who
was the drunkest who was like,

6118
02:41:03,181 --> 02:41:03,961
you just add a zero.

6119
02:41:03,961 --> 02:41:05,520
So if you bought blue 0.36,

6120
02:41:05,521 --> 02:41:09,510
you got a $360 in the bank just for
going home and being responsible.

6121
02:41:09,870 --> 02:41:10,920
Then every game we played,

6122
02:41:10,921 --> 02:41:11,601
you could accrue money,

6123
02:41:11,601 --> 02:41:15,390
so could bounce with like 750 bucks for
the group and we'll drop you off at home

6124
02:41:15,391 --> 02:41:17,700
and you just made money in
[inaudible] stupid fucking show.

6125
02:41:17,701 --> 02:41:18,570
Are you involved in,

6126
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:19,620
it was a lot of money.

6127
02:41:19,740 --> 02:41:20,101
So,

6128
02:41:20,101 --> 02:41:20,610
uh,

6129
02:41:20,610 --> 02:41:21,443
so,

6130
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:24,660
so with the Lens of fear factor host,

6131
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:26,211
sorry.

6132
02:41:26,211 --> 02:41:27,570
So we last dudes,

6133
02:41:27,571 --> 02:41:28,404
we picked up,

6134
02:41:28,530 --> 02:41:31,520
we said it was game Tom and
created called liquor stick it.

6135
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:35,490
We put a picture of a girl and you've
got to guess if she's straight or gay.

6136
02:41:35,820 --> 02:41:36,653
Licorice stick it.

6137
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:37,920
And so like,

6138
02:41:38,130 --> 02:41:41,130
like three pictures of girls that are
innocuous like pink and everyone's got it.

6139
02:41:41,130 --> 02:41:41,321
You know,

6140
02:41:41,321 --> 02:41:42,170
and like just short,

6141
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:43,620
just short haired girls,

6142
02:41:43,621 --> 02:41:43,831
you know,

6143
02:41:43,831 --> 02:41:43,951
that,

6144
02:41:43,951 --> 02:41:45,450
that they may not know who they are,

6145
02:41:45,451 --> 02:41:46,284
but then the handgun.

6146
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:47,250
Yeah,

6147
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:47,701
ambiguous.

6148
02:41:47,701 --> 02:41:48,011
I'm sorry,

6149
02:41:48,011 --> 02:41:49,590
I'm not innocuous.

6150
02:41:49,660 --> 02:41:50,493
Fine.

6151
02:41:50,580 --> 02:41:53,040
I'm like knock ewas vacuous.

6152
02:41:53,041 --> 02:41:58,041
So one of them is Jamie Lee Curtis and
the guy goes and they all say lick it and

6153
02:41:58,801 --> 02:41:59,521
then this one kid goes,

6154
02:41:59,521 --> 02:41:59,701
no,

6155
02:41:59,701 --> 02:42:00,061
stick it.

6156
02:42:00,061 --> 02:42:00,894
My Dad fucked her.

6157
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:01,471
And we're like,

6158
02:42:01,471 --> 02:42:02,100
what?

6159
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:02,370
And he was,

6160
02:42:02,370 --> 02:42:03,001
my dad fucked her.

6161
02:42:03,001 --> 02:42:03,900
I think I'd go,

6162
02:42:03,901 --> 02:42:06,480
but I heard she's a hermaphrodite
because my dad never said that.

6163
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:07,141
But then again,

6164
02:42:07,141 --> 02:42:08,290
what dad's gonna say to his son,

6165
02:42:08,300 --> 02:42:09,133
he fucked a dude.

6166
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:09,721
You know,

6167
02:42:09,721 --> 02:42:14,250
that's a really bad Freudian slip because
innocuous means like not dangerous or

6168
02:42:14,251 --> 02:42:19,251
offensive and ambiguous means
don't pay me enough and not do it.

6169
02:42:21,400 --> 02:42:22,620
And knock us is like,

6170
02:42:22,621 --> 02:42:23,261
hey,

6171
02:42:23,261 --> 02:42:24,094
you know she,

6172
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:28,290
she ain't even taking a dick and not a
lot of it knock us women that don't count

6173
02:42:28,291 --> 02:42:31,620
in my book because she
might be sucking cock.

6174
02:42:31,860 --> 02:42:33,000
I was in not a Freudian slip,

6175
02:42:33,001 --> 02:42:34,440
it was just me being dumb.

6176
02:42:34,730 --> 02:42:35,340
Yeah.

6177
02:42:35,340 --> 02:42:36,850
Innocuous is a beautiful word.

6178
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:38,190
Get off correctly.

6179
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:43,700
If you can pull it off people like half
my life is spent saying some real really

6180
02:42:44,030 --> 02:42:46,320
does just say it's the worst one
that's ever come out of your mouth.

6181
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:47,310
So that you went,

6182
02:42:47,310 --> 02:42:47,940
Ooh,

6183
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:48,571
I said,

6184
02:42:48,571 --> 02:42:48,710
uh,

6185
02:42:48,710 --> 02:42:50,130
did the nail stage in Portland.

6186
02:42:50,131 --> 02:42:50,964
I said,

6187
02:42:50,970 --> 02:42:52,650
I was explaining a joke and I said,

6188
02:42:52,651 --> 02:42:56,280
I was explaining to my daughter the
tenements of comedy and someone goes,

6189
02:42:56,281 --> 02:42:57,114
you mean tenants?

6190
02:42:58,380 --> 02:42:58,561
Well,

6191
02:42:58,561 --> 02:42:59,580
10 minutes of word.

6192
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:01,080
I Said said apartment building.

6193
02:43:01,220 --> 02:43:02,053
Yeah,

6194
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:03,733
I did.

6195
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:05,040
I got a better one.

6196
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:05,850
I said,

6197
02:43:05,850 --> 02:43:06,630
I did.

6198
02:43:06,630 --> 02:43:11,630
I took a movie pitch out for like fucking
literally 10 before someone stopped me

6199
02:43:12,861 --> 02:43:13,340
goes,

6200
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:16,400
I think you're using the term
a salt of the earth wrong.

6201
02:43:17,060 --> 02:43:18,770
I thought salt of the earth was like,

6202
02:43:19,070 --> 02:43:19,501
dude,

6203
02:43:19,501 --> 02:43:20,870
that just hang around all the time.

6204
02:43:22,580 --> 02:43:23,180
So I was like,

6205
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:23,421
I was like,

6206
02:43:23,421 --> 02:43:25,580
this guy grew up with
the salt of the earth.

6207
02:43:26,060 --> 02:43:29,360
That's the type of person that sold you
the earth means like the really good

6208
02:43:29,361 --> 02:43:29,751
people.

6209
02:43:29,751 --> 02:43:30,000
Great.

6210
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,730
I just thought it meant people
that hung out and were like,

6211
02:43:31,731 --> 02:43:31,941
you know,

6212
02:43:31,941 --> 02:43:34,220
like you know the dudes that were always
on the corner of the salt of the earth.

6213
02:43:34,340 --> 02:43:34,611
Oh,

6214
02:43:34,611 --> 02:43:35,391
that's interesting.

6215
02:43:35,391 --> 02:43:36,201
Why did you think that?

6216
02:43:36,201 --> 02:43:39,520
You just like heard the expression
and never investigated Joe?

6217
02:43:39,590 --> 02:43:41,270
At one time I gave a speech,

6218
02:43:42,230 --> 02:43:43,310
I thought the word,

6219
02:43:43,820 --> 02:43:48,820
I thought idiot savant was synonymous
with autistic and I said to my boss,

6220
02:43:49,430 --> 02:43:50,263
I said to my,

6221
02:43:50,420 --> 02:43:50,900
well,

6222
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:52,190
for a lot of folks it is,

6223
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:53,380
but an ironman.

6224
02:43:53,450 --> 02:43:57,500
I thought what I was trying to say is
my buddy is really good when it comes to

6225
02:43:57,501 --> 02:44:00,770
meeting people I met say like he's
the idiot savant of meeting people.

6226
02:44:00,770 --> 02:44:02,330
You don't need to even be just does it,

6227
02:44:02,510 --> 02:44:04,200
but I see you said the autistic I go,

6228
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:05,120
he is autistic.

6229
02:44:05,121 --> 02:44:08,120
When it comes to meeting with
people and people were like,

6230
02:44:08,150 --> 02:44:08,640
oh fuck,

6231
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:13,130
you're using that role and I was giving
a speech in front of like 500 dudes,

6232
02:44:13,580 --> 02:44:14,330
artists,

6233
02:44:14,330 --> 02:44:17,090
autism and being autistic
is very unfortunate.

6234
02:44:17,091 --> 02:44:20,420
It's actually the direct opposite
of meeting people sometimes.

6235
02:44:20,421 --> 02:44:21,254
Sometimes,

6236
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:24,680
but if someone is artistic
and also a savant,

6237
02:44:24,860 --> 02:44:25,430
then it's like,

6238
02:44:25,430 --> 02:44:26,150
oh,

6239
02:44:26,150 --> 02:44:27,470
he's emotionally troubled,

6240
02:44:27,471 --> 02:44:29,630
but look at the great blank.

6241
02:44:29,631 --> 02:44:31,560
He does idiots.

6242
02:44:31,710 --> 02:44:32,391
Silvana is,

6243
02:44:32,391 --> 02:44:33,650
I don't even know if
that's politically correct.

6244
02:44:33,651 --> 02:44:34,221
I don't know what I'm saying.

6245
02:44:34,221 --> 02:44:34,370
No,

6246
02:44:34,370 --> 02:44:35,990
there's nothing wrong
with an idiot some lot,

6247
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:36,561
but it's like,

6248
02:44:36,561 --> 02:44:37,420
it's like when it comes to math,

6249
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:39,860
it becomes naturally and
they're so good at it.

6250
02:44:40,070 --> 02:44:40,940
They're amazing.

6251
02:44:41,240 --> 02:44:41,770
Right?

6252
02:44:41,770 --> 02:44:42,850
So I was trying to say it.

6253
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:43,221
No,

6254
02:44:43,221 --> 02:44:43,401
no,

6255
02:44:43,401 --> 02:44:43,581
no,

6256
02:44:43,581 --> 02:44:43,761
no,

6257
02:44:43,761 --> 02:44:43,971
no,

6258
02:44:43,971 --> 02:44:44,360
no.

6259
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:45,230
It's not just that.

6260
02:44:45,260 --> 02:44:47,600
It's the idea that they're
not good at anything else.

6261
02:44:47,940 --> 02:44:50,780
It's like you take a guy that
could barely communicate with you,

6262
02:44:50,900 --> 02:44:53,360
but then you put them on a piano
when he makes amazing music.

6263
02:44:53,390 --> 02:44:54,500
That's an idiot savant.

6264
02:44:54,740 --> 02:44:55,130
So it,

6265
02:44:55,130 --> 02:44:55,700
it's to bond.

6266
02:44:55,700 --> 02:44:56,860
This guy's a terrible way to,

6267
02:44:56,890 --> 02:45:01,890
to express it because it's clearly someone
who has a troubled brain function or

6268
02:45:03,351 --> 02:45:05,270
a troubled mental function,

6269
02:45:05,271 --> 02:45:05,660
whatever,

6270
02:45:05,660 --> 02:45:06,830
however you want to describe it.

6271
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:09,290
And they also have,

6272
02:45:09,320 --> 02:45:09,680
um,

6273
02:45:09,680 --> 02:45:11,090
a lot of energy floating around.

6274
02:45:11,091 --> 02:45:12,530
And sometimes if they can focus it,

6275
02:45:12,531 --> 02:45:16,430
whether it's on art or whether it's on
music or whether it's on whatever it is,

6276
02:45:16,700 --> 02:45:17,100
you know,

6277
02:45:17,100 --> 02:45:17,360
uh,

6278
02:45:17,360 --> 02:45:18,500
it could be video games,

6279
02:45:18,501 --> 02:45:19,850
it could be a game,

6280
02:45:19,851 --> 02:45:21,980
it could be something that intrigues them,

6281
02:45:21,981 --> 02:45:22,200
that

6282
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:22,950
math,

6283
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:23,521
whatever it is.

6284
02:45:23,521 --> 02:45:24,060
Absolutely.

6285
02:45:24,060 --> 02:45:24,391
Math,

6286
02:45:24,391 --> 02:45:24,850
music,

6287
02:45:24,850 --> 02:45:25,683
dancing.

6288
02:45:25,740 --> 02:45:26,730
And when that happens,

6289
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:30,150
then they find an outlet
for that intense focus.

6290
02:45:30,151 --> 02:45:32,090
Because they're there,

6291
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:32,330
right?

6292
02:45:32,330 --> 02:45:36,560
Because the fact that they're
limited in various social arenas,

6293
02:45:36,860 --> 02:45:40,100
limited in their understanding
of human communication,

6294
02:45:40,101 --> 02:45:42,290
they might not put any
resources to that at all.

6295
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:42,770
They,

6296
02:45:42,770 --> 02:45:46,790
one of the awkward aspects of who they
are might be that they don't put any

6297
02:45:46,850 --> 02:45:47,750
resources to that.

6298
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:49,160
They just have blocked that out.

6299
02:45:49,490 --> 02:45:54,490
So instead they can concentrate almost
entirely on trying something or making a

6300
02:45:54,531 --> 02:45:54,860
mute.

6301
02:45:54,860 --> 02:45:55,451
A song.

6302
02:45:55,451 --> 02:45:55,680
Right.

6303
02:45:55,680 --> 02:45:55,861
Yeah.

6304
02:45:55,861 --> 02:45:58,020
Well I would have used it wrong
if I said it that way too.

6305
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:59,370
I meant to say it was really good at it.

6306
02:46:00,150 --> 02:46:00,840
So I,

6307
02:46:00,840 --> 02:46:01,920
I chose idiot savant.

6308
02:46:02,500 --> 02:46:02,750
No,

6309
02:46:02,750 --> 02:46:05,320
no there's nothing wrong
with saying idiot savant.

6310
02:46:05,350 --> 02:46:07,060
Even as a goof on your friends.

6311
02:46:07,061 --> 02:46:07,870
Cause saying like,

6312
02:46:07,870 --> 02:46:10,130
cause we all know that guy that's not good

6313
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:10,970
at one thing,

6314
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:11,750
but he's,

6315
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:12,271
you know,

6316
02:46:12,271 --> 02:46:14,060
or he's not good at a lot of things.

6317
02:46:14,061 --> 02:46:16,370
But this is one thing and
he's fucking awesome APP.

6318
02:46:16,670 --> 02:46:16,930
You know,

6319
02:46:16,930 --> 02:46:21,110
whether he's an awesome mechanic or
he's an awesome musician or an awesome

6320
02:46:21,111 --> 02:46:21,860
comedian.

6321
02:46:21,860 --> 02:46:24,380
I mean how many comedians that we
know that are absolutely hilarious.

6322
02:46:24,381 --> 02:46:27,050
But if Joey Diaz had a
function in the real world,

6323
02:46:27,170 --> 02:46:30,440
you can't tell me Julie Diaz is not an
idiot savant for standup comedy and not,

6324
02:46:30,441 --> 02:46:32,210
and that by saying he's an idiot savant.

6325
02:46:32,390 --> 02:46:34,730
I would never say he's an idiot
because he's a brilliant person.

6326
02:46:34,910 --> 02:46:36,770
When it comes to recognize
what's funny about something.

6327
02:46:36,771 --> 02:46:37,160
Yeah,

6328
02:46:37,160 --> 02:46:41,930
he's got a true genius
perspective when it comes to that,

6329
02:46:42,230 --> 02:46:44,260
but if we give,

6330
02:46:44,270 --> 02:46:46,250
Joey had to work in a factory next to you,

6331
02:46:46,251 --> 02:46:49,670
you'd be hating your life except for the
fact that the stories would be awesome.

6332
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:50,370
Love it.

6333
02:46:50,370 --> 02:46:51,201
Work next to him.

6334
02:46:51,201 --> 02:46:51,760
He'd probably love it.

6335
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:54,260
Although you were picking up his job,

6336
02:46:54,410 --> 02:46:57,260
the company would only love it if
they could enjoy his personality,

6337
02:46:57,261 --> 02:46:59,360
but if the company had to
rely on its productivity,

6338
02:46:59,361 --> 02:47:00,230
they'd be fucked.

6339
02:47:01,250 --> 02:47:02,510
The Real Kenny powers,

6340
02:47:03,380 --> 02:47:04,400
he's better than that.

6341
02:47:04,401 --> 02:47:04,941
Better than that,

6342
02:47:04,941 --> 02:47:05,391
but it's like,

6343
02:47:05,391 --> 02:47:05,750
it's like,

6344
02:47:05,750 --> 02:47:06,583
yeah,

6345
02:47:06,590 --> 02:47:07,460
that's a character.

6346
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:08,660
He's the real deal.

6347
02:47:08,770 --> 02:47:12,290
He's just doesn't fuck around
a kind of version of that.

6348
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:12,690
Yeah.

6349
02:47:12,690 --> 02:47:14,870
That side sort of a hyper,

6350
02:47:14,871 --> 02:47:15,230
c'mon,

6351
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:16,490
what are we doing here guys?

6352
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:17,151
The Guy,

6353
02:47:17,151 --> 02:47:20,690
the guy who comes up with his own way
of handling the situation that she ever,

6354
02:47:20,691 --> 02:47:22,910
do you ever watch Sean rouse
do standup comedy show?

6355
02:47:22,911 --> 02:47:23,600
I Love Shaun.

6356
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:24,171
What's he up to,

6357
02:47:24,171 --> 02:47:24,560
man?

6358
02:47:24,560 --> 02:47:26,240
He's got a lot of physical problems.

6359
02:47:26,241 --> 02:47:26,690
Is that what it is?

6360
02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:26,990
Yeah,

6361
02:47:26,990 --> 02:47:27,823
he's got a lot of,

6362
02:47:27,890 --> 02:47:29,840
he's got real bad arthritis.

6363
02:47:29,900 --> 02:47:30,291
I man,

6364
02:47:30,291 --> 02:47:32,450
he was fucking talented.

6365
02:47:32,870 --> 02:47:33,200
Yes.

6366
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:35,460
So fucking talented and he's a beautiful,

6367
02:47:35,980 --> 02:47:37,100
I was thinking idiot savant.

6368
02:47:37,101 --> 02:47:37,934
Like he's almost like,

6369
02:47:38,030 --> 02:47:39,050
it's like that person now.

6370
02:47:39,051 --> 02:47:40,170
He's actually a good comic.

6371
02:47:40,171 --> 02:47:40,761
You Fuck No.

6372
02:47:40,761 --> 02:47:41,740
But his personality,

6373
02:47:41,810 --> 02:47:43,460
so like if you put him in a workplace,

6374
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:44,533
there's no like,

6375
02:47:44,860 --> 02:47:47,900
like there's no dialing that back maybe,

6376
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:48,261
you know?

6377
02:47:48,261 --> 02:47:48,621
I mean,

6378
02:47:48,621 --> 02:47:49,101
I don't know.

6379
02:47:49,101 --> 02:47:51,770
I don't know what kind of
jobs he's had his hand up.

6380
02:47:51,980 --> 02:47:52,600
It's,

6381
02:47:52,600 --> 02:47:54,740
it's hard to do anything
but stand up a bunch of,

6382
02:47:54,741 --> 02:47:56,870
you're good at stand up
because everything else,

6383
02:47:57,670 --> 02:47:58,850
it seems so boring.

6384
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:01,790
You ever play that game?

6385
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:02,930
Imagine if you had another job.

6386
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:03,860
I have other jobs,

6387
02:48:03,861 --> 02:48:08,780
so I try to keep other
jobs like UFC and podcasts.

6388
02:48:08,830 --> 02:48:11,050
That's saying no,

6389
02:48:11,060 --> 02:48:11,691
not a job.

6390
02:48:11,691 --> 02:48:12,524
Job.

6391
02:48:14,650 --> 02:48:16,100
Take rules from a guy named Derek.

6392
02:48:16,130 --> 02:48:16,963
That's work.

6393
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:17,661
Yeah.

6394
02:48:17,661 --> 02:48:18,560
That is not fun.

6395
02:48:18,620 --> 02:48:20,180
Who's like I said,

6396
02:48:20,181 --> 02:48:25,181
10 o'clock it's 10 oh five work at ups
checking boxes in the back of a truck.

6397
02:48:25,510 --> 02:48:25,870
I,

6398
02:48:25,870 --> 02:48:28,370
I see those dudes that listen to these
podcasts and the color and they're like,

6399
02:48:28,371 --> 02:48:28,671
man,

6400
02:48:28,671 --> 02:48:32,150
you guys doing that podcast
makes my life so fucking doable.

6401
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:33,133
And you think to yourself,

6402
02:48:33,140 --> 02:48:37,940
what a fucking service you
get to delivered to like
a guy just like yourself.

6403
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:38,901
Exactly.

6404
02:48:38,901 --> 02:48:39,320
Shelf.

6405
02:48:39,320 --> 02:48:39,920
I just,

6406
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:40,251
for me,

6407
02:48:40,251 --> 02:48:43,550
I can say just like me because I just
got lucky and really stone wrote an

6408
02:48:43,551 --> 02:48:44,384
article about me.

6409
02:48:44,510 --> 02:48:44,780
Right?

6410
02:48:44,780 --> 02:48:45,470
So like I,

6411
02:48:45,470 --> 02:48:45,681
yeah,

6412
02:48:45,681 --> 02:48:46,730
but that's all bullshit.

6413
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:47,290
I know.

6414
02:48:47,290 --> 02:48:50,840
But it was a doorway that opened
up that allowed you to be bird.

6415
02:48:51,290 --> 02:48:52,123
You know,

6416
02:48:52,190 --> 02:48:54,320
we all got lucky at one point in time.

6417
02:48:54,321 --> 02:48:57,560
I got lucky that a friend talked me into
going on stage at an open mic night in

6418
02:48:57,561 --> 02:49:01,070
1988 and we were all got
lucky in one way or another.

6419
02:49:01,071 --> 02:49:02,330
But from there on,

6420
02:49:02,630 --> 02:49:03,770
it's really just about,

6421
02:49:03,890 --> 02:49:06,860
and this is a really important
thing for other people to realize.

6422
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:07,800
Like people,

6423
02:49:07,840 --> 02:49:07,960
I,

6424
02:49:07,960 --> 02:49:08,220
I,

6425
02:49:08,220 --> 02:49:10,650
we've had this discussion on the
podcast before and people like,

6426
02:49:10,651 --> 02:49:10,831
Oh,

6427
02:49:10,831 --> 02:49:11,850
you're just counting luck.

6428
02:49:12,390 --> 02:49:13,410
Absolutely not.

6429
02:49:13,710 --> 02:49:18,150
There's unquestionably the fact that
you're even alive is incredibly fortunate.

6430
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:20,130
If you look at children
that have progeria,

6431
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:23,130
if you look at people that are born
in terrible places in the world,

6432
02:49:23,220 --> 02:49:25,260
just the fact that you're in America,

6433
02:49:25,261 --> 02:49:29,280
you have to concede to a certain
amount of luck in this life.

6434
02:49:29,310 --> 02:49:30,510
There's no doubt about it.

6435
02:49:30,930 --> 02:49:32,250
But I'm from then on,

6436
02:49:32,520 --> 02:49:37,520
what allowed you to move forward and
what allowed you to advance yourself to a

6437
02:49:39,271 --> 02:49:42,960
position where you're really
comfortable creating comedy on stage?

6438
02:49:43,410 --> 02:49:44,610
It's not a lot of luck.

6439
02:49:44,970 --> 02:49:47,130
I mean there's sometimes locked pops up,

6440
02:49:47,131 --> 02:49:48,300
but you know when it comes,

6441
02:49:48,570 --> 02:49:50,100
when you actually have done work,

6442
02:49:50,410 --> 02:49:52,260
if you're going to be a comedian,

6443
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:53,520
if you're going to be a performer,

6444
02:49:53,521 --> 02:49:54,840
if you're going to be someone who people,

6445
02:49:54,900 --> 02:49:58,680
there's going to be some amount of
talent and work that's involved there.

6446
02:49:58,680 --> 02:49:59,760
It can't just be luck.

6447
02:50:00,330 --> 02:50:05,330
And so to concentrate on the luck of
others is a very negative way of focusing

6448
02:50:06,391 --> 02:50:07,224
on things.

6449
02:50:07,350 --> 02:50:10,710
And it doesn't inspire you because
it seems so random and unfair.

6450
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:14,520
You know when you look at a
guy who named the Guy Blank,

6451
02:50:14,790 --> 02:50:18,330
this guy all of a sudden has got you
selling out arenas and he sells a million

6452
02:50:18,331 --> 02:50:19,890
CD's and why him?

6453
02:50:19,891 --> 02:50:22,740
And he got lucky and
if it wasn't for this,

6454
02:50:22,741 --> 02:50:23,670
this lucky fuck,

6455
02:50:23,671 --> 02:50:27,630
and you're doing a disservice
to yourself by focusing on that,

6456
02:50:27,780 --> 02:50:29,760
there's that shouldn't even exist to you.

6457
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,410
Well you should do is say,

6458
02:50:31,411 --> 02:50:32,100
wow,

6459
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:33,630
look at what's possible.

6460
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:35,520
Look at what's possible.

6461
02:50:35,521 --> 02:50:36,354
If you're this guy,

6462
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:37,500
look at what's possible.

6463
02:50:37,530 --> 02:50:41,850
That's incredible and it should make
you instead of like shitting on this guy

6464
02:50:41,851 --> 02:50:42,450
instead of like,

6465
02:50:42,450 --> 02:50:45,200
oh Kevin Hart or all the fucking knew

6466
02:50:45,570 --> 02:50:46,403
Ken Young,

6467
02:50:47,270 --> 02:50:49,980
someone who can cook like that.

6468
02:50:49,981 --> 02:50:50,280
You would,

6469
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:51,570
that you would let people go.

6470
02:50:51,740 --> 02:50:52,091
No.

6471
02:50:52,091 --> 02:50:53,070
Cause he's hilarious.

6472
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:53,933
He's amazing.

6473
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:55,113
I'm not,

6474
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:56,213
I didn't mean Ken.

6475
02:50:56,550 --> 02:50:56,761
Ken,

6476
02:50:56,761 --> 02:50:58,110
don't hear that and think I said that,

6477
02:50:58,290 --> 02:50:58,721
but I,

6478
02:50:58,721 --> 02:51:02,210
but I know what you're saying when
you go like he was just a harder,

6479
02:51:02,220 --> 02:51:03,460
better example really.

6480
02:51:03,730 --> 02:51:05,340
I think Kevin's fucking so talented,

6481
02:51:06,180 --> 02:51:07,120
talented people.

6482
02:51:07,220 --> 02:51:09,350
But people will question there.

6483
02:51:09,370 --> 02:51:09,611
Oh,

6484
02:51:09,611 --> 02:51:10,640
it's got to be lucky.

6485
02:51:10,641 --> 02:51:11,060
I've heard,

6486
02:51:11,060 --> 02:51:14,030
I've heard it so many
times and you get lucky.

6487
02:51:14,031 --> 02:51:15,140
It's not possible.

6488
02:51:15,260 --> 02:51:18,320
So you just say it because
it didn't happen to them
and they think that this guy

6489
02:51:18,321 --> 02:51:20,630
got picked somehow that he
figured his way through.

6490
02:51:21,020 --> 02:51:24,470
People find a way to
justify their continence.

6491
02:51:24,540 --> 02:51:25,230
Yeah.

6492
02:51:25,230 --> 02:51:25,681
Cause I,

6493
02:51:25,681 --> 02:51:26,400
I understand.

6494
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:28,260
I mean I think Kevin Young,

6495
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:29,280
Kevin Hart,

6496
02:51:29,610 --> 02:51:31,140
I just don't have forever.

6497
02:51:31,141 --> 02:51:33,070
I think he's super talented and,

6498
02:51:33,071 --> 02:51:33,990
and even Ken Young,

6499
02:51:33,991 --> 02:51:34,290
but,

6500
02:51:34,290 --> 02:51:35,880
but the only argument I would give with,

6501
02:51:36,070 --> 02:51:36,871
with like Ken was at,

6502
02:51:36,871 --> 02:51:40,560
he's a movie star and he got into a
movie that happened to blow the fuck up.

6503
02:51:40,710 --> 02:51:42,450
Like people could argue Zach's very lucky.

6504
02:51:42,451 --> 02:51:43,740
I think Zach's very talented,

6505
02:51:43,890 --> 02:51:44,723
just like Ken.

6506
02:51:45,150 --> 02:51:49,320
Like they just happened to gotten
to be into the biggest movie of this

6507
02:51:49,321 --> 02:51:50,154
generation.

6508
02:51:51,300 --> 02:51:51,810
Yeah.

6509
02:51:51,810 --> 02:51:54,010
The hangovers dub good.

6510
02:51:54,180 --> 02:51:54,990
Exactly.

6511
02:51:54,990 --> 02:51:56,760
But I'm saying that's
how people could argue.

6512
02:51:56,780 --> 02:51:57,200
Luck.

6513
02:51:57,200 --> 02:51:57,470
We

6514
02:51:57,470 --> 02:52:00,710
all know the god that wasn't that
good sort of snuck into things.

6515
02:52:00,711 --> 02:52:04,190
And then after awhile people
figuring them out or they get better.

6516
02:52:04,191 --> 02:52:06,040
I mean those are the
only that are available.

6517
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:08,920
Either they get better or people
figure him out and they they,

6518
02:52:08,960 --> 02:52:09,850
they fade away.

6519
02:52:09,960 --> 02:52:10,390
Yeah,

6520
02:52:10,390 --> 02:52:13,090
but that's just this weird
ass fucking stupid business.

6521
02:52:13,460 --> 02:52:14,980
It's business is super unhealthy.

6522
02:52:15,370 --> 02:52:15,910
I say that.

6523
02:52:15,910 --> 02:52:19,270
I would say so that La is like a
methadone clinic for attention whores.

6524
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:21,010
Like you never really get cured.

6525
02:52:21,011 --> 02:52:22,480
You just get hooked on some new shit.

6526
02:52:22,930 --> 02:52:26,860
You just get hooked on some acting
shit or some popularity shit.

6527
02:52:26,890 --> 02:52:27,730
We're having kids.

6528
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:28,821
Yeah.

6529
02:52:28,821 --> 02:52:29,220
Some people,

6530
02:52:29,220 --> 02:52:29,371
well,

6531
02:52:29,371 --> 02:52:30,040
yes,

6532
02:52:30,040 --> 02:52:30,430
I saw it.

6533
02:52:30,430 --> 02:52:31,260
It definitely does it.

6534
02:52:31,260 --> 02:52:32,001
We had to do like,

6535
02:52:32,001 --> 02:52:32,550
uh,

6536
02:52:32,550 --> 02:52:33,720
an hour long.

6537
02:52:34,200 --> 02:52:35,033
Are we getting close?

6538
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:35,471
Yeah,

6539
02:52:35,471 --> 02:52:35,701
we're on,

6540
02:52:35,701 --> 02:52:36,491
but five minutes away.

6541
02:52:36,491 --> 02:52:39,880
Do we turn into a pumpkin
fuck three hour podcasts.

6542
02:52:40,080 --> 02:52:40,630
All right,

6543
02:52:40,630 --> 02:52:42,190
let's wrap this rock this.

6544
02:52:42,650 --> 02:52:44,500
It's kind of comfortable
now that Brian's not here.

6545
02:52:44,700 --> 02:52:46,630
It's unfortunate for him.

6546
02:52:50,500 --> 02:52:51,380
Brian's listening,

6547
02:52:52,390 --> 02:52:53,211
listening to shit.

6548
02:52:53,211 --> 02:52:54,560
That lazy bitch will never hear this.

6549
02:52:54,561 --> 02:52:55,610
Let somebody tweets it to him.

6550
02:52:55,730 --> 02:52:56,990
He texted me and he goes,

6551
02:52:56,991 --> 02:52:58,310
you can download opie and Anthony.

6552
02:52:59,720 --> 02:53:00,021
Yeah.

6553
02:53:00,021 --> 02:53:02,810
You were talking nonsense about
audible.com one of our sponsors.

6554
02:53:03,050 --> 02:53:03,501
Are they really?

6555
02:53:03,501 --> 02:53:04,370
One of your sponsors,

6556
02:53:04,740 --> 02:53:05,573
but it's okay.

6557
02:53:05,930 --> 02:53:07,400
I mean you should be
able to express yourself.

6558
02:53:08,250 --> 02:53:08,660
You're like,

6559
02:53:08,660 --> 02:53:08,890
ah,

6560
02:53:08,890 --> 02:53:10,010
points and Amazon.

6561
02:53:10,011 --> 02:53:10,910
I don't sign up for that.

6562
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:11,480
Yeah,

6563
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:11,931
it's me.

6564
02:53:11,931 --> 02:53:12,110
It's,

6565
02:53:12,110 --> 02:53:12,711
it's dated.

6566
02:53:12,711 --> 02:53:14,930
I was also the guy in
college and they were like,

6567
02:53:15,230 --> 02:53:15,890
listen,

6568
02:53:15,890 --> 02:53:20,150
or our assignment today is
to email your paper to us.

6569
02:53:20,151 --> 02:53:20,650
And I was like,

6570
02:53:20,650 --> 02:53:20,960
ah,

6571
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:22,100
this is never going to last.

6572
02:53:22,101 --> 02:53:23,300
I don't know why we're learning this.

6573
02:53:24,110 --> 02:53:28,220
They were also the guy that pissed on
his father-in-laws dining room table.

6574
02:53:29,970 --> 02:53:30,800
Yeah,

6575
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:32,630
I shit on a pizza box to win an election.

6576
02:53:32,650 --> 02:53:33,081
But you've,

6577
02:53:33,081 --> 02:53:34,280
you've evolved past that,

6578
02:53:34,281 --> 02:53:35,870
past that completely.

6579
02:53:35,930 --> 02:53:37,250
How you constantly working on yourself,

6580
02:53:37,251 --> 02:53:40,850
Bert Kreischer what is your message for
the folks of America that are listening

6581
02:53:40,851 --> 02:53:44,510
right now or England or Ireland or
China or wherever the fuck they are?

6582
02:53:45,020 --> 02:53:46,430
My question is,

6583
02:53:46,530 --> 02:53:47,363
uh,

6584
02:53:49,290 --> 02:53:50,820
just be honest.

6585
02:53:51,240 --> 02:53:52,170
That's a good move.

6586
02:53:52,200 --> 02:53:53,420
It's my only thing was stages.

6587
02:53:53,470 --> 02:53:53,780
I,

6588
02:53:53,780 --> 02:53:55,290
I'm getting in trouble
with it a little bit.

6589
02:53:55,530 --> 02:53:56,363
Just be

6590
02:53:58,140 --> 02:53:58,600
trouble.

6591
02:53:58,600 --> 02:53:59,680
Never heard nobody.

6592
02:53:59,681 --> 02:54:02,050
Bert Kreischer just trust me.

6593
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:03,460

6594

6595
02:54:04,691 --> 02:54:05,524
