1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,050
You know,

3
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,860
I've fouling when I go to pitch ain't,

4
00:00:03,861 --> 00:00:06,110
I'll go to pitch and idea
about a new show or something.

5
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:06,620
Right.

6
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,190
And they're all,

7
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,330
and like this one guys is like,

8
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,231
that's a horrible idea.

9
00:00:09,231 --> 00:00:10,820
Don't ever tell anyone that idea again.

10
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,740
That's always the best idea I've found.

11
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:14,450
Like if an executive session sucks,

12
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,600
goats go digital and do it
because it'll fucking kid.

13
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,240
Yeah.

14
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,910
Once I pitched over the phone
and the guy actually like said,

15
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:22,720
you're kidding,

16
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,320
right?

17
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,561
You did.

18
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:24,760
Did you waste my time with this?

19
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,631
And I was like,

20
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:26,464
wow.

21
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,160
All right.

22
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,330
I guess she didn't like my idea.

23
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,410
I pitched over the phone,

24
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:30,040
he was like,

25
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,311
I go,

26
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:31,360
I have this idea for a show.

27
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:33,070
It's just a silly idea,

28
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,730
but it's like,

29
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,730
it's a comedy and it's about these girls
that work at a bikini pizza place in

30
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:45,811
the day called pizza sluts and at
night they fight crime and they're,

31
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,071
they're,

32
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:51,960
they're super hot chicks that are
recruited by the police force and,

33
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,970
and trained to infiltrate into areas
where other cops could never get checked.

34
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,650
Cause people would never believe that
these hot girls were actually secret agent

35
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,890
slats were actually secret agents.

36
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:03,300
Yeah.

37
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,880
Why did they have to work at the pizza
place and then a full time job though?

38
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,500
Well because they got to have a cover
part of the cover and then get to see them

39
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:14,370
in their underwear is the smart
county and fucking dude was mad at me.

40
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,121
This is chuck.

41
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:15,770
He pitched it.

42
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,610
The dude was mad as a
long time ago by the way.

43
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,870
And the dude was mad at me.

44
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:19,230
I was like,

45
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,580
I think that would be a silly show.

46
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,670
Like you don't think there could be
like a ton of jokes and shit like that.

47
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,810
You'd get 2 million viewers

48
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,290
completely over the top.

49
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,880
Have you ever pitched something
just to fuck with somebody?

50
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,743
No.

51
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,110
Have you waste time?

52
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:34,531
If you do?

53
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:35,041
Sometimes,

54
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:35,620
yeah.

55
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,453
Yeah.

56
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,480
This is not at first this was,

57
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:40,751
I took,

58
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:41,530
I mean like I,

59
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,850
I make my money helping people.

60
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,151
Right.

61
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:43,720
And I make my,

62
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,100
my real money is made on speeches.

63
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:47,400
Like I go to do motivational
speeches at colleges,

64
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,550
teaching kids to get their shit
together and stop being busy.

65
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,000
It's up to stop being
a whiny little bitch,

66
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,631
right speech.

67
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,010
It's just this entitlement by college.

68
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:57,400
Kids in college is really like me coming
and I do about an hour speech and then

69
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,710
a half hour Q and a and
then I'll do a live podcast.

70
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,570
It's great.

71
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,320
I mean for me that's amazing money.

72
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:03,700
It changes our family's life,

73
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,360
right?

74
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,920
So now it's like if I can do TV,

75
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:06,251
great.

76
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,690
If I don't that's fine too.

77
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,553
I'd like to do it,

78
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,330
but like I'll have an idea.

79
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,390
I mean I had an idea of hoarder road trip.

80
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,190
I just wanted to take a bunch
of hoarders and I went to Vega.

81
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,140
Take them cross country.

82
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:16,390
You make him clean up
someone else's house.

83
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:16,851
Oh,

84
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:17,684
that's a good idea.

85
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,520
I think it'd be fascinating to see.

86
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:20,600
I like that cross country.

87
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:20,800
Right?

88
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
At first it was a joke,

89
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,210
but then the more I started
pitching and I was like,

90
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,800
actually I like to actually take this.

91
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,590
But the first time I was just trying to
piss off the executive cause he had sat

92
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:30,410
on my pilot for a year and
so I was just mad at him.

93
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,610
He sat on the pilot.

94
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,061
I do,

95
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,510
I've done two pilots and I didn't realize
this is everyone's done 10 pilots.

96
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:36,410
It is what it is.

97
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,880
Don't worry about it.

98
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:40,580
I was devastated because my
first pilot didn't make show.

99
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,720
Really?

100
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:41,901
Yeah.

101
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:42,621
I was devastated.

102
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,071
Devastated.

103
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:43,371
I was like,

104
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,204
this is gonna.

105
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:44,990
I mean I,

106
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,823
I really,

107
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,950
I put all my eggs in that basket and
I was just emotionally and I was like,

108
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,310
this is so important that I get to show
and by the time the network and the

109
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:53,900
production company and
they got done with it.

110
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,760
It was a shitty show and
I didn't want to do it.

111
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,460
And I was like praying that
it wouldn't get to pick it up.

112
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,010
But then when it didn't get picked up,

113
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,170
I got all upset and I got,

114
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,140
I got personal with it.

115
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,860
And I just,

116
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,180
I've learned now it is what it is.

117
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,010
It's just business.

118
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,320
It's,

119
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,060
it's really hard to be on a show and watch
it fall apart because too many people

120
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:11,990
have their input and they fuck with you.

121
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,910
I had no input.

122
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,660
Yeah.

123
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:13,961
You know,

124
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,590
and it was like,

125
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,271
my name's on that.

126
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:16,700
It's my company's name is on it.

127
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:17,370
Then it doesn't,

128
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:17,751
and it,

129
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:18,230
I mean,

130
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,400
well,

131
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,150
executive always think they always think
that they have a way to tweak it and to

132
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:22,984
make it better.

133
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,620
Yeah.

134
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,750
I'm not saying I'm brilliant or anything.

135
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,261
I was just,

136
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,340
I was personally upset.

137
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,031
I think that,

138
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:28,570
you know,

139
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:28,900
the,

140
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,160
the collaborative effort,

141
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,330
like a real true creative,

142
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,660
collaborative effort only works with
people who respect each other creatively.

143
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,600
Like people will actually approve and
to be creative in order to bring someone

144
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,460
like an executive and
to a creative meeting.

145
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:42,280
Like what are you a creative
person who do you write a lot?

146
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,030
I mean,

147
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,250
you're going to have good ideas or is
this like an ego bullshit thing here and

148
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,290
your greasy fingerprints on this and
add your little ingredients to the soup.

149
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,310
That's what a lot of it is.

150
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,271
But I mean,

151
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,380
I'm by with hoarders,

152
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,490
there's no writing.

153
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:54,940
I mean,

154
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,830
we turned the cameras on and shit happens.

155
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,730
Yeah.

156
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,211
And that's it.

157
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:59,620
It's your show.

158
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,101
No,

159
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:00,431
I don't,

160
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,170
I'm just talent on that.

161
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,570
How many different dudes
are Horter cleaners?

162
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,321
We've got,

163
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:05,561
well,

164
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:06,590
there's two really loud,

165
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,060
I mean there's a lot of
people that that try to do it,

166
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,740
but it's like a hit show,

167
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:12,070
right?

168
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,400
Oh,

169
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,390
do doing really well.

170
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:13,730
You know,

171
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,790
I say I'm the number one
trash man in the country in a,

172
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,730
and he has no problem with you doing
all your other stuff or they just don't

173
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:18,910
know.

174
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,830
Sign me to con I don't even on a contract,

175
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,990
you're not on a contract and week to week.

176
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,621
Whoa.

177
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,130
That's crazy.

178
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,881
That's got to be annoying.

179
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:25,840
And the number one guy on,

180
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,320
you know,

181
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,190
their number two show.

182
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,070
It amazes me.

183
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,570
I'm fine.

184
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,560
I don't want a contract now.

185
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,730
Like it doesn't contract.

186
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:31,511
I couldn't come do this.

187
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:32,200
Like I'm,

188
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,060
you said it best the
other day on your podcast.

189
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,690
You Go,

190
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,950
I'm doing what I should be doing.

191
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,900
You're doing it right now.

192
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,891
And I'm there,

193
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,131
man.

194
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:39,820
My Pi Pica,

195
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,421
I'm doing,

196
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:41,021
I wrote a book,

197
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,310
had a great run with my book.

198
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,810
I'm helping a lot of
families with my book.

199
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,070
It's called secret lives of hoarders.

200
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:48,670
So you're just happy to keep moving
work direction and keep working.

201
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,500
I clean up shit for 12 bucks an hour.

202
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,570
I'm happy to be working,

203
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,643
period.

204
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,380
Like I'm lucky to have work.

205
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:55,520
I,

206
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,620
I can afford all my groceries and
my mortgage in the same month.

207
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,753
I'm lucky.

208
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,020
Like that's awesome.

209
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:12,090
Yeah.
