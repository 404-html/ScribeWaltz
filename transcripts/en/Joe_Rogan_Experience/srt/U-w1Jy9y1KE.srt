1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,350
Yeah. How's that? Is that
it? Is that for real?

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,320
I always wondered when I was a little kid,

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,080
why do American Indian songs
sound so like, like what is that?

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,750
And then I realize they're high as fuck

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,940
cause when you're high as fuck then
it seems like it sounds kind of cool.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,320
Jesus dude. Sounding really cool
right now. Rogan. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,460
Yay.

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:31,880
What though?

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,100
The rattling sound that you hear Lacey
gentleman is an actual bottle of Alpha

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,810
brain.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,590
Oh,
do not.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,710
Well you also hear my fucking laptop
in the background because I'm retarded.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,470
This is,
this is Outbrain.

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,840
This is what I take before I do
anything cause I'm an Alpha brain junky.

16
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
I take the shit before I do standup.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm not lying about this by the way.
I take this before I do any podcasts,

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,150
any UFC. I've done you fcs before
without him and I panic a panic.

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,810
I got to go with extra red bull and
me and Mike Goldberg make fucking,

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,660
we have races to see who can
get to the bathroom first.

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,450
Rebel goes right through
you. I said, double stack it.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,420
This is not a red bull type feeling.
If you're wondering what Alpha brain is,

23
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:12,520
it's essentially nutrients that
enhance your ability, your,

24
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,120
your brain's ability to
produce neurotransmitters.

25
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:19,140
It's all different nutrients that have
been shown to have a positive effect on

26
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:23,960
brain function. It is a very
controversial subject. Um, I've,

27
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,740
I've looked at both ends of it. I've
talked to people who think it's a placebo.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,090
I believe that everybody's body
works completely differently.

29
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:36,300
I know that some people can eat peanuts
and have a great old time and other

30
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,930
people eat them and they're fucking dead.
I don't understand that.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,960
But what I do understand is what
benefits mean and what has been shown to

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,120
benefit people and what,
what has a long history of human use.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,440
And that's all the ingredients inside
Alpha brain. To go and check this out,

34
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:59,370
go to [inaudible] dot com it's o, n, n,
I, t, and all of it is explained to you.

35
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,200
And the way, the only reason why I
would be in business with anybody,

36
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,620
and this is this includes
Tang, which we, you know,

37
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:10,050
we're in business with sometimes
or audible or you know,

38
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:14,400
any of the alien where any of the people
that we, we, we talk about on the show,

39
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,980
even that we don't get money from
like h two o or a c two o rather see,

40
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,810
oh yeah, water. Does he give
us any money? Those kinds of,

41
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,120
she bitches a c two oh, coconut water.
It's fucking delicious. They're great.

42
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:31,440
Grillo's pickles. They're fucking the
most delicious pickles on earth. I, if,

43
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,920
if I tell you it's
because it's true to me.

44
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,180
I believe it 100% there's news. I've
been wrong about shit before. Trust me.

45
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,400
But I'll tell you that too.
If I am wrong,

46
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,880
I'll absolutely fucking telling
you I'm wrong. Alphabet.

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm not wrong about the fucking dreams
that you have. First of all, that's,

48
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,010
I would take it just for the dreams.
If you'd take it and then go to bed,

49
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,150
you have the most intense graphic dreams.
They're intense and they're,

50
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:57,990
they're very lucid man. And I don't know
what it is, but it's not bad for you.

51
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:00,790
That's all you have to worry.
It's all just nutrients.

52
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,930
There's nothing crazy in there.

53
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,210
There's no pharmaceutical
drugs is nothing to addictive.

54
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,680
Can tell you about a story
about one of the dreams.

55
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,710
I gave something to my Russian housekeeper
and she took them and she went back

56
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:12,820
to a lot via 1965 and spoke to her
grandfather. Whoa. In the dream,

57
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,451
the lucid dream.

58
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:17,210
And she came back the next day and she's
like playing with the fuck Jesus Christ.

59
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:20,500
He's lucid. Dreams are no joke. They don't
know. They don't always happen though.

60
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:24,700
I've taken it before and had nothing.
I've had no dreams. Um, I don't,

61
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,280
I don't understand the
process behind her dream.

62
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,300
It was so intense that you inside your
dream found out a way to delete it so you

63
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:34,000
won't remember it, baby.
Yeah. Well that's, you know,

64
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,460
that's the mechanism
behind dimethyltryptamine.

65
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,560
The mechanism behind dimethyltryptamine
is the same mechanism behind a dreams,

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,670
which is really weird. How, you know, how
you can wake up and you're like, fuck,

67
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,030
what a dream I had, man.
We were on roller skates,

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,220
we were running from Godzilla and
it was my cousin who I grew up with,

69
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,860
but I haven't seen him since I was
13 he's like, why didn't you call me?

70
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,180
And I felt fucking guilty.

71
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,850
Meanwhile Godzilla's chasing
us and you could remember it.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,250
But then if I came up to you like
a half an hour later and I said,

73
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,280
tell me what that dream again. You'd be
like, well fucking train mas it again.

74
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,890
Shit. What happened? Hate. Fuck. It's
weird. It's like your brain erases it.

75
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:14,070
It's like whatever it is is based on
something that the brain is already really

76
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:18,100
good at getting rid of.
And that DMT DMT,

77
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:22,500
which is a crazy psychedelic drug that
your brain makes. And it's also, you know,

78
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,520
available in plant form.
But the idea is that when you are,

79
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,970
you're dreaming intense dreams at what's
going on is your brain is producing

80
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,170
dimethyltryptamine,

81
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:36,070
your brain is producing this hallucinogen
and nobody really understands what

82
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:38,940
it's about. And some people
actually believe that, you know,

83
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,020
there's an old term called sleep
on it. You know, if you have,

84
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,320
you have something that's bothering you,
sleep on it,

85
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,270
and maybe you come up with a
good decision in the morning.

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,280
A lot of the reasons for that term is
because you really do think about things

87
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:54,610
that are troubling you and while you're
sleeping and if you are tripping,

88
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,590
if that is what's happening
when you're sleeping,

89
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,760
if we're all growing through a DMT trip,
that is a race by the time we wake up,

90
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,940
which is a distinct
possibility considering the
weirdness of dreams and what,

91
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:09,610
what are they, the ones that seem
really real, what are, what are these,

92
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,290
these are obviously hallucinations,

93
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:16,060
like really intense hallucinations but
in a much more controlled form then like

94
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,750
say a DMT state. Well it could just be,
it's a low level of DMT experiences,

95
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:20,440
certain um,

96
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,830
eastern religions which believe that the
life we're living now is actually just

97
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:27,040
the dream at your highest self is having,
which I find very interesting.

98
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,790
It's just as likely as being alive,
being alive. It's pretty fucking bizarre.

99
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,330
Being able to measure things so you're
fucking eyeballs and figure out where

100
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,450
things are. All of that is,
it's weird as shit, man.

101
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,110
Being a human is weird as shit is
fucking crazy. Dreams are weird.

102
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,230
It's weird that you shut off every night.
It's weird to for eight hours.

103
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:48,190
We just accept that we're going to
just normal and you look forward to it.

104
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,030
Everybody's scared to die. No one's scared
to take naps. Just fucking shut. Right.

105
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,150
I used to go to sleep as a kid. I'd
be like, Oh shit. Here it comes.

106
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,190
I don't know why Alpha brain gives you
a of, so you can send me with tenure

107
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,620
with us, but it does. It gives
you crazy fucking dreams.

108
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,900
Shroom tech support is another
great product from on it.

109
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,260
It's my favorite product as far
as like a athletic performance.

110
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,000
It's based on a quarter steps.
Mushroom,

111
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,690
plenty of data out there after
interested in googling it. Um,

112
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,040
the quarter zips mushroom is also the
same mushroom that makes fucking ants that

113
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,430
like makes them zombies and
makes their heads explode.

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,670
Different strain of different
strain folks. It comes out.

115
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,120
You don't have to worry about
that. You ever seen that? Yeah.

116
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:27,260
There's a branch of the quarter steps
mushrooms that infects these uh, ants.

117
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,680
Fascinating shit man. And it turns
a turns. The ants and the like,

118
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,640
these Zombie ants and the other ants have
to get the body when these things die

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,540
and get them whey the fuck away from
the ant hill because they explode out

120
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:42,260
spores, which they affect all these
other ants. What are you saying?

121
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,990
Welcome to the call for. Okay, listen,

122
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,950
I'm not saying that it's not the same.
It's not the same thing.

123
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,410
Imagine if that's how we're doing.

124
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,250
Your honor would say they're
doing mine control in the form

125
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,150
mushroom mind control.
It's not that folks.

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,630
That's what it was, man
motivators. Aubrey brands,

127
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,830
29 year old dude had it all figured out.

128
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,280
We're going to have fucking for
flashlights in the future. His hands.

129
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,520
Listen folks, I don't listen
to that guy. He's crazy.

130
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,200
But we also have kettle bells,
which are recently in and battle ropes.

131
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,850
That's all. Everything we sell is
the highest quality shit possible.

132
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,020
You can't get any better.

133
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,590
And we tried to sell it to you as cheap
as possible and make the deal as easy as

134
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:31,780

135
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:34,780
There's a 100% money back
guarantee in the first 30 pills.

136
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,060
You don't have to send them back
and just say this stuff socks,

137

because nobody wants to rip you off and

00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,520
you're going to appreciate the effects
of it and you're gonna or you're some

140
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:49,210
fucking weird or the candy
peanuts. I don't know. I
don't know what your deal man.

141
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,660
Go to [inaudible] dot com use the code
name Brogan and you'll save yourself 10%

142
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:56,840
off the supplements and you will save
nothing off battle ropes and kettlebells

143
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,010
cause them shits is expensive and don't
use the code name London real on this

144
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,710
show. Wait for our show. Yeah, if
you use the code named Lyndon Real,

145
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:04,970
do you get something?
You get like 10% of us and

146
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,510
then Joe offsets in the parking lot later
going off through the words that keep

147
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:14,890
on code cock block. It is a
coupon code, cock block exercise.

148
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,370
It would be if we were all like go on
some sort of a percentage of sales basis.

149
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,750
That's why you would want to use the
word olive garden. Fuck you. Get,

150
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,060
they charge you more. They say that
son of a bitch charge him double.

151
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,260
We were told we were told to olive
garden before Brian did new percent you,

152
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,490
they charge you more. Do
you, can I get a call?

153
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,890
I'll keep on code that charges
$10 more on your order,

154
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:47,680
but it just donates the death squad.
That would be hilarious. Yeah.

155
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,180
That is the other thing. We're
sponsored by desk squad. Dot.

156
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:54,470
TV is Brian's site or Brian makes
these ridiculous cat tee shirts that,

157
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:55,650
I see it all my shows now

158
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,720
that that is a,

159
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,900
that those are all his designs and the
money goes to Brian to support his death

160
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:04,680
squad podcast network and you're like,
what the fuck is a desk squad?

161
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,300
It's a very vague in strange,
strange topic,

162
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,900
but we got Kevin Tomorrow. Yes,
Kevin prayer come a part of it.

163
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,950
The desk that squad is, it's just a
nickname that was given to us a long,

164
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:21,951
long time ago and it's now sort of
branched out into Brian's podcasts and,

165
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:25,570
and it's still like,
it's a family, you know,

166
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,830
that's what really desk what represents
to all of us. You know, when we,

167
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,240
when we talk about if we put death squad
under a post and it's Joey is and Ari

168
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,000
and Brian and Dunkin are all on a
show together, you know, that's,

169
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,650
that's what we call it desk.
While here it's family.

170
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,550
It's just like the hall of Jesus Christ.
It's like subliminal the motherfucker.

171
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,120
He entered into my mind with an
olive garden commercial olive garden,

172
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,990
will you please pay this fuck olive
garden? What do we, what do we have to do?

173
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,370
And he's gotten them saying it.

174
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,570
Brody Stevens is recommending the olive
garden on the fucking Chelsea handler's

175
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:01,470
show you sons of bitches get off
your ass and sponsor this kid.

176
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:04,620
He's the number one olive garden.
Support it in the country. Essentially.

177
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,090
I don't understand it,

178
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,180
but I also don't understand that just
for men commercial where the fucking baby

179
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:13,140
has a beard and drives a car. I don't
understand that. There's a lot of shit.

180
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:16,740
I don't understand. Have you seen that
commercial? We'll talk about that. Listen,

181
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,220
you know how it was in London. London
real is here. Strap the fuck in.

182
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,700
We're fixing to get shit. Pop and
desk. Squad. Dot TV for the tee shirts.

183
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:27,690
Stickers represent a desk squad all over
the country that you guys were there in

184
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:32,120
North Carolina and I saw you in Toronto.
All you fucking freaks. Alright.

185
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:32,971
Cue The music.

186
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:37,971
Sun Experience.

187
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,530
Train by day.
Joe Rogan podcast.

188
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,653
Gentlemen,

189
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,750
welcome. Welcome. Thank you to be,

190
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,560
it's awesome to be so good to
have you guys here. Um, uh, I, uh,

191
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,720
saw you guys on youtube a while back.
Uh, I don't remember what the f I just,

192
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:02,590
just say that the gentleman,
Brian and nick, who's Brian
who's name, I'm Brian Rose

193
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,760
from London real. These guys are, uh,

194
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,710
one of the coolest up and coming podcast
that I've had a chance to listen to and

195
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:16,120
uh, really, uh, is fucking right up our
alley. The stuff you guys talk about,

196
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,830
the people that you have on, you know,
you had shock filet on, you had uh,

197
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,680
you had Graham Hancock on fresco.
You mean, did I say, I'm sorry,

198
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,900
which one is Jack Valet?
No frescoes in 96 year old frescoes.

199
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,800
The Venus project and a project
guy. Yeah, sorry, Mr. Shock. Uh,

200
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,800
but you've had a, you know,
you had Graham Hancock on,

201
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:40,300
you guys have had some just right up
our alley guests. It's really, uh, it's,

202
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:44,560
it's beautiful to see that there's more
out there that there's people that are

203
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:47,710
doing this in London. You know, there's
people that are doing this in Toronto.

204
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:52,711
I ran into a lot of people in Toronto
that have podcasts and it's essentially,

205
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,740
it's all the same thing. It's like, you
know, you get together and you go, women,

206
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,670
I would like to talk about some shit
that I don't see talked about in the

207
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:01,540
mainstream news.

208
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:06,541
Like there's all this nonsense in the
news about celebrities or about parts of

209
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:11,590
the world that really don't even have
anything to do with our day to day lives,

210
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,490
but there's all these other weird subjects
that aren't getting covered. You know,

211
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:18,200
there's so much, it's fascinating
things about like what, wait, what?

212
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,850
What's going on with the
psychedelics? Like what is this? What?

213
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,310
What are they here for? What's
this all about? Because this,

214
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,890
can this be a debate for intelligent
people to sit down and talk or does it

215
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,870
immediately get derided and,
and, and reduced to some
silliness to some, oh yeah.

216
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,810
What were you going to take a loosen a
Jones? Yeah. Why don't you just fucking,

217
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,120
why don't you get up in the morning and
put a tie on like a gentlemen, you know,

218
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,050
to Hancock about that. As soon as
I mentioned I Wasco or anything,

219
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,020
everyone's eyes just glaze
over and they're like, oh,
you're one of those guys.

220
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:45,880
Yeah.
They think you're a crazy person.

221
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,310
If you want to talk about
altered states of consciousness,

222
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:52,630
you're a crazy person in California too.
Yeah. Well, it's a little better here.

223
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,980
It's a little better here. Um, this is
the most progressive spot in the country,

224
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:59,770
I think as far as like the ideas of,

225
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,310
I have a feeling about
humans in America and the,

226
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,650
it's not that there's not
amazing people on the east coast.

227
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,500
There's amazing people all throughout
the country, but I think there's a,

228
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,950
there's a prevailing attitude of the,
the region.

229
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,560
Like people always talk about
liberals in California. Well,

230
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:19,480
the reason why is because like in the
east coast is where all the people first

231
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:21,880
landed, right? That's where all
the people from Europe are like,

232
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:26,020
Fuck Europe or so done. There's a
new spot. They can't fuck with you.

233
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,070
We're going to make our own laws.

234
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,690
And that got all crazy and conti and
people just decided to keep going.

235
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,790
And a lot of people kept going
and they just kept going.

236
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,590
They eventually on fucking horses with
wooden wheels got all the way to the

237
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:42,460
other side and we're like, fuck, we can't
go any further. All right, let's stop.

238
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:45,640
People complain when the transatlantic
flight is delayed by 30 minutes.

239
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,740
And then it was what would the
ancestors went through, right? Yeah.

240
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:48,580
They had to eat each other.

241
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:52,020
Man Eat each other and the milestone
with eight each other. That sound,

242
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:53,020
that's no joke,
man.

243
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,300
It was a scary time for human beings and
I think there was a lot of times where,

244
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,500
you know,
people would start out and not make it.

245
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,780
They would try and a scary time
for human beings though, Joe,

246
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,810
and this is a scary game. We're
all playing, right? It is.

247
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:10,240
It's the same scary game we were
playing when I was in high school,

248
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:13,120
when I was in high school, was
about the Soviets. It was always,

249
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,800
you were talking about that
recently. People Forget. I mean,

250
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:18,590
I used to go to sleep at
night, really worried about
nuclear war. How old are you?

251
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,900
I'm 41 you ever see that movie?
The day after it was on,

252
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,930
I was like 10 or 12 it was his whole
television movie about basically a nuclear

253
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,630
war and the end of it, I mean,
I stood up. I was up for days.

254
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,870
I don't remember that one in particular,
but I bet I saw it.

255
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,340
I've seen so many of them.

256
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:37,360
I've seen so many apocalyptic mad max
type movies where the, for some reason,

257
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,110
you know, I am legend type
shit goes down and we just,

258
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,610
you think America needs an enemy.

259
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,060
Like do we need someone to kind of always
be the bad guy? Well, we're not real.

260
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,900
So when you say it, does America need
an enemy? America's not even real. It's,

261
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,660
there's just a bunch of humans and they
did decide to call it American act as a

262
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:57,980
group, but it's pretty obvious at this
point that it's, that's not real. It's us.

263
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,671
That's real.

264
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:01,610
It's humans and he might as well be
you guys when you hear your Americans,

265
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,540
it's like, what? What is America? It's
just a fucking spot. It's just a spot.

266
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,030
And the idea that this spot
acts as one unit and, and,

267
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:12,080
and we should all go along
with what the spots doing.

268
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,580
That's fucking completely ridiculous
because we don't get a say it's,

269
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,370
and what they're doing is
completely contrary to what
most of the people in this

270
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:20,840
country would want to get done.

271
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,140
So what we have is like a fake country
and we have a really a dictatorship.

272
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,730
That's run by money and it's
just run with a loose grip.

273
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,670
It's not run with a dog
collar around your neck,

274
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:38,360
so you constantly feel oppressed.
It's run with a loose grip of corruption.

275
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,050
It's a loose grip of corruption and
entanglement where there's no way to get

276
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:44,240
into the system where a
guy like Gary Johnson,

277
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:47,780
who's the only one left running for
president who makes any fucking sense.

278
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,840
The Libertarian candidate can't even
get into the debates because they won't

279
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:55,580
treat them seriously because
the media is really fake.

280
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,570
The media is really bought and
sold and it's a news program.

281
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,220
It's a news program where they pick
and choose what aspects of the news,

282
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:09,221
what angle of the news instead of giving
you all the information and anything

283
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:14,231
that has anything to do with criticizing
America or anything that shows American

284
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:18,350
a bad light is all got to
be reviewed before it's put
on air. It shows, you know,

285
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,690
while I was watching you while
you were giving that speech,

286
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:24,350
I just really felt that you
really want people to wake up.

287
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,890
You rarely odd tarnation wake up to,
they can't operate like this.

288
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:30,320
They don't have to. The news
doesn't have to operate like this.

289
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:32,180
The government doesn't
have to operate like this.

290
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,850
The corporations don't
have to operate like this.

291
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,740
No one's saying you can't do business.

292
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,610
What we're saying is business doesn't
mean you have to fucking rob people.

293
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,570
Business doesn't mean you have to use
lobbyists to influence policy so that you

294
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:45,650
can pollute rivers.

295
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,010
Business doesn't mean that you can
store nuclear waste in the middle of the

296
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:51,350
fucking desert because you
don't know how to get rid of it.

297
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,770
You're not supposed to do any of that
stuff until you know how to get rid of it.

298
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,390
Don't make it.
You know,

299
00:16:56,391 --> 00:17:00,260
we should really probably shouldn't
even be on fucking nuclear power because

300
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,120
we've had several major incidents
over the past 100 years.

301
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,270
100 years ain't shit when it comes to how
long the fucking earth is and how long

302
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:13,340
radioactive material lasts.
So if you're having nuclear,

303
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,090
if they've put together these power
plants that if something goes wrong,

304
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,560
that spot is poison for 100,000 years.

305
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,920
You cannot live there anymore. And then
even after a hundred thousand years,

306
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,950
who's going to be that first
of fucking move back there?

307
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,580
If we've keep an any sort of
accurate records whatsoever,

308
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,940
who the fuck is going to be the first
person to move back to where there was a

309
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:39,210
nuclear disaster and power
plants imploded? No one,

310
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,160
no one's going to do that.

311
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,060
So that spots ruined essentially
for longer than humans
have is existed. That's,

312
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,100
that's how long we've ruined Chernobyl.
That's how long we've ruined Fukushima.

313
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,820
We're ruining the spots. I, and it's,
there's a lot of power plants, man,

314
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,200
hundreds of them all over the place and
they could all equal a spot where one

315
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,380
day you can't go anywhere near them.
We're,

316
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,800
we're assuming we're going to be able
to keep the power on indefinitely and

317
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:06,040
Cooley's fucking things off. That's
why they've built them. Yeah.

318
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,900
But it's in human nature to only change
our behavior when something really bad

319
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:12,560
happens. It's just the way it is.
Right. What's fascinating, it's a,

320
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:16,830
it's just an aspect of denial, you know,
it's in, that's how corporations work.

321
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:20,220
The reason what corporations are able
to get away with the shit they do bribe

322
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:22,680
politicians and and and,
and influence,

323
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,780
literally wore and murder is because
they act as a group that's just trying to

324
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:29,400
get zeroes and ones,

325
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,990
they're just trying to get money so they
don't look at things in terms of like

326
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:35,490
their moral value.
They look,

327
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,110
they look at things in terms of
is this good for our stockholders?

328
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,800
Is this good for our business? Can we
make a profit here? Can we get over there?

329
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,690
And when you have
companies where you know,

330
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,110
you get a guy like Dick Cheney who's
the fucking head of a company called

331
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:53,370
Halliburton that fix his shit up after
it gets blown up and then this guy

332
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:57,180
becomes the vice president and just starts
blowing shit up and then giving these

333
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:59,280
contracts with the company
that he used to run.

334
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,620
That is one of the craziest things
that's ever happened in front of human

335
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:05,820
beings.
W there was,

336
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:10,821
it was essentially a jacking on
television live publicly and government

337
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:16,041
sanctioned where they jacked
a whole country and jack
the American people to and

338
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:22,050
made us give money to these corporations
that would fix shit that we blow up and

339
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:24,870
even build shit that's not necessary.

340
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,910
Have you talked to people
that are over there?

341
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,640
They'll tell you that they just have
like a certain amount of money they're

342
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:33,210
supposed to spend and they have a certain
amount of projects that they can build

343
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:35,910
a desalinization plant that people like,
we don't fucking need this.

344
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:39,210
Like we're building it. You know you
need it, you want it. It doesn't matter.

345
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,480
We were building a desalinization plant
cause we've got the contract for it and

346
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:47,040
there's just billions of dollars is
going over their billions and billions.

347
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,330
Neil degrasse Tyson had a speech where
he was talking about that we have the

348
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:55,290
capability now we have the knowledge and
the knowhow to build a telescope that

349
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,290
literally can go back and look
at the beginnings of time.

350
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,250
Like we can build a telescope that
is just infinitely more powerful than

351
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:06,720
anything that exists today would cost
about $10 million, $10 billion to,

352
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,381
you know,

353
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:10,680
it sounds like an incredible amount of
money until you find out how much money

354
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:14,340
to spend in Iraq. And they spent 10
million billion dollars every few days.

355
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,750
I was just constant of of species must
have a really a really negative comma

356
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,910
because we have so much potential,

357
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,670
but we just seem to channel it in
the wrong direction. And maybe,

358
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,400
maybe it's not us. Maybe it's just
a comma that we're burning through.

359
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:30,990
We have to go through all this shit.
It's not us, it's just the look.

360
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,350
The business of running
countries has not changed.

361
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,290
Although the access to
information has changed radically.

362
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,350
So the understanding of what a country
really is, it's changed radically.

363
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,490
But the business of running countries
has not changed to same thing that they

364
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:47,710
did during the Roman
empire they're doing today.

365
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,100
They're just doing it through
a loose series of guidelines.

366
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,970
But it's really clear that they're
robbing country's resources,

367
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,800
controlling people's militaries,
attacking people mercilessly,

368
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,640
putting fear and terror.
And you want to talk about Orwellian,

369
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,620
we have fucking robots that we operate
with remote control from the other side

370
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:13,621
of the planet that shoot missiles from
the sky that kill people like that is

371
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,840
bananas. The fact that that's one
of the major ways that we rocket.

372
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,860
In 2012 we literally sent fucking Darth
Vader spaceships that shoot rockets from

373
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,530
the sky. That is the, that's insane.

374
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,280
Do you ever get concerned that you might
have or you might face repercussions

375
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:33,220
from the US government one way or another
for the views you're promoting their

376
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:37,510
show? Well, no, because I just, it's
everything that I'm saying is all obvious.

377
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,370
It's all right out there in the open.
It's not,

378
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:41,500
I mean like if you want to
look at the Halliburton thing,

379
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,470
it's not like that fucking Rogan.
He gave up the goods on Halliburton.

380
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,730
Everybody knows that Halliburton has
a completely corrupt, the, the, the,

381
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:51,280
the relationship that Halliburton to
the United States is completely corrupt.

382
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,270
Just by virtue of the fact that they
got no bid contracts, these enormous,

383
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:58,600
enormous contracts. Like that's not
the taxpayer is being looked after.

384
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,900
That's not the government being frugal
or being conservative with money.

385
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:07,050
That's a relationship between someone
who influenced either directly with money

386
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:10,960
or indirectly by getting their
former CEO to run the country.

387
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,760
I think the idea of a
corporation has a good thing.

388
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,730
I just think we need to regulate the
fuck out of him. It they have to,

389
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,750
they have to have a good mind.

390
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,610
I mean from a just a limited
liability corporate standpoint.

391
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,510
I mean you do believe that there is a
reason for them because otherwise if you

392
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:22,791
couldn't,

393
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:26,050
she couldn't invest in on it and then
otherwise they might come and take your

394
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:28,780
car away. I think it's unlimited
lives. I think. I believe,

395
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:32,530
I believe in paying taxes. I pay my
taxes. I never cheat on my taxes.

396
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:36,490
I pay a lot of money in
taxes. I pay, I believe in,

397
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,050
I believe in state taxes too. I mean, I
think I pay state taxes in California.

398
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,230
I know a lot of people that move to
Nevada strictly because they don't have to

399
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:47,200
pay state taxes and stuff.
I don't mind paying for things.

400
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,340
I don't mind government.

401
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,310
I think it all can be done correctly
and but it's all going to be done.

402
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,820
It sounds Corny as fuck,
but it's all going to be done with love.

403
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,910
It can't be done with fear and
it's all being done with fear.

404
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,480
The whole way the world is being
done is being done with fear and it's

405
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,700
everybody's like, fuck
you, I'm going to Nuku.

406
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,880
If there were people that would be
the most ridiculous people ever.

407
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,660
If I ran an Israel with people,
you'd want to kill the both of them.

408
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,010
You'd be like, well, you to
just shut the fuck up. My God.

409
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:19,510
You bickering cunts. You next door
neighbors who just, you're a fucking baby.

410
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:20,290
You're a baby.

411
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:25,290
This one asshole has a cartoon bomb he's
using in a UN speech to show when it

412
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,180
gets to here,
that's one we're in trouble like I,

413
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:31,960
it's a bomb like showing
Iran's nuclear capabilities.

414
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:35,460
If you've seen this now is this, let's
pull this up. Brian's doing Netanyahu.

415
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,360
That mother fucker, that's silly
bitch Netanyahu, who's the the,

416
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,800
what does the prime minister of Israel.

417
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,230
He's showing like when
we have to attack Iran,

418
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,130
he's got this nuclear
bomb and it's like get

419
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,800
to a certain point and that's when you
got to attack. They're just, I mean,

420
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:51,420
they're insecure over there and they're
like pawns in a little chess game that

421
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:54,130
had all the big powers are
playing in the same zero Yahoo,

422
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,120
Yahoo, Yahoo. Yeah.

423
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:04,121
Netanyahu bomb cartoon joint
Israeli Palestinian podcast.

424
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:08,810
I think it would just need him talk.
It's, yeah, that's, that's the,

425
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,530
that's the, the, the conflict
to end all conflicts.

426
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,960
That's the conflict that's
going been going on forever.

427
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,040
It's like it's never going to end that
whole Middle Eastern coffee. Look at that.

428
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,250
Look at that picture. Okay. That's,
is that the most ridiculous shit ever?

429
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,660
He's like, well, this is it.

430
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,260
When I'm in a job said it's childish
and I agree with them in a job.

431
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,820
How about that dude who
says no Iranian gaze?

432
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,150
He doesn't believe in gay
marriage. She's, I believe,

433
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,540
who knows what the Holocaust gyre
is really said. Is he a holocaust?

434
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,710
Jesus Christ.
Meanwhile,

435
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,310
I believe in him when it's his
taste tasting cartoons is excellent.

436
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,010
At least you're honest. It just,
it seems like, you know, so

437
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,960
if, if, if,

438
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,710
if corporations and governments
all sort of have this diffusion of

439
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:57,020
responsibility and even
though we're in America,

440
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,810
all the things that go on
that we don't agree with,

441
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:03,200
like drone attacks and all
the shit, you know, it all,

442
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:07,490
it becomes a matter of how much of
an impact does that have on the rack,

443
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,110
the whole rest of the population.

444
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,810
And if it only has a minor impact
on the rest of the population,

445
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,340
a lot of times he can get away with it.

446
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,380
And that's the situation that we're
in right now. We know that too.

447
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,550
In order to change things,

448
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,960
who would require a major overhaul and
it would be really difficult for a lot of

449
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:24,591
people.
I mean,

450
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:29,320
the government is comprised
of a huge amount of,

451
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,620
of human beings.

452
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,160
There's a lot of people that
essentially are completely unnecessary.

453
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:37,640
If we had a real Justin true government,
they're really not necessarily,

454
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:38,900
I don't really believe in conspiracies.

455
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,440
I think it's just people have these
positions where they had these great jobs

456
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,760
and they're collecting money as a
contractor. Halliburton and whites.

457
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,500
Why change things? Yeah, there's a lot
of that, but there's also conspiring.

458
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:51,770
We know they conspired with Enron
and essentially Halliburton was,

459
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,490
they were allowed to conspire
Halliburton's clear conspiracy.

460
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,910
But we also know a lot about
government conspiracy from the past.

461
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:01,850
That's not just like ideas and thoughts,

462
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,060
but stuff that actually has
been proven to have happened.

463
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,720
Like the Gulf of Tonkin. They'll,
they'll, you know, the, the,

464
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,960
the idea that they got us into a war
in Vietnam with like a fake story.

465
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,140
They've got the operation
Northwoods operation dirty trick,

466
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:18,680
which is where they were going to blow
John Glenn was going to be the first

467
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:23,630
person into orbit and if anything happened
to his, his space shuttle, his, uh,

468
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,610
his rocket,
they were going to blame it on.

469
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:28,430
The Cubans were going to
blow up like some fucking,

470
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,400
it was a reason to attack Cuba. We
were like, look, it's a win win.

471
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,220
If John Glenn makes it, he's the
first guy in space, you know,

472
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,460
if it doesn't make it, we blame it
on, the Cubans would go fuck him up.

473
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,850
And that was, that was the plan.
And this is not a conspiracy.

474
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:43,980
This is like this is written document.
Do you think the government

475
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,020
needs some secrecy?
Otherwise there's no diplomacy.

476
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,010
I mean you can't have a policy but it
means Obama can announced the night before

477
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:54,450
he's going to go in and and
you know assassinate and
that has to be some kind of,

478
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,110
I don't, first of all, I don't
believe they did really loud.

479
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,090
No Dude's good debt.

480
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,180
I've talked about people.
If I had to say,

481
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:06,270
I would probably say that more than
anything else that Joe blow is fishing.

482
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:11,390
I've talked to dudes who are in special
forces type jobs and they were like,

483
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,100
that guy's been dead forever.
They're like those guys.

484
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:16,890
But I dunno what the fuck happened.
And dudes were laughing about it.

485
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,660
Like was tell him, write that story. Nope,

486
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,390
didn't sound right to anybody
in any other country either.

487
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,660
Because you hear about that guy that wrote
that book that's like a national best

488
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,310
seller that he was one of the guys.

489
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,670
His story differs from the government
versus he said it would be like if it was

490
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:31,680
really weird,
his beard was completely black.

491
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,380
When they came in and like there
was no gray hairs and stuff.

492
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:39,000
Like would he be really just for
meaning his beard? Well, he might,

493
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:42,000
Brendan Walsh does.
I think it looks sexy as fuck on Brendan.

494
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,570
I would say I would support it. And
why not do you don't do it? Who Cares?

495
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,460
You know? Uh, but, uh, I don't,
who cares? I don't care if they,

496
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,820
I don't think, you know,
the whole reason why, oh,

497
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,410
that guy existed is because we
do it the only way a guy like,

498
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,273
uh,

499
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,430
Osama bin Ladin or any of these radical
guys ever exists is there's gotta be

500
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:09,690
some great empire to oppose and it's not
a great empire of altruism is trying to

501
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:14,691
help people all over the world and trying
to enhance the lives of people and,

502
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:17,960
and clean up their areas
and make money in, in,

503
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:22,830
in helping countries instead of making
money and just robbing their resources

504
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:26,850
and then taking out their military, taking
out their collapse, it will collapse.

505
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:31,110
That's the problem. We don't have to
have an empire. See, that's the problem.

506
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,350
They're all empires do collapse
because they're run by cons.

507
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,000
You can't run an empire, not be a con.
Well, we not, we need is civilization.

508
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,010
We don't need an empire anymore. All
these, these, these organizations,

509
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:45,840
they're not,
they're not necessary.

510
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,060
What we need to figure out is how natural
resources can be distributed equally

511
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:53,490
to all nations.
And that sounds fucked up.

512
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,300
But that's reality is otherwise everyone's
just going to go where the resources

513
00:28:57,301 --> 00:29:00,150
are and they're going to argue
about this a lot. I mean, I think,

514
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,250
I'd like to believe that that's the case,

515
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:07,170
that we could have a free society of a
fairer society. But, um, I think Brian,

516
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:10,950
you believe that like human nature just,
it's never going to happen, right? I mean,

517
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:14,010
I have a lot of thoughts
about human nature. I think
humans are inherently lazy.

518
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:16,500
And if we had like a socialist system,
a lot of people wouldn't do anything.

519
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,200
So I think capitalism doesn't
motivate people to a certain extent.

520
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,090
Of course it can go a little too far.

521
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,330
Certainly Kenton's corporation start
acting in their own interest and they

522
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:27,930
become really big and it certainly
is a great motivating factor.

523
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:30,510
I believe you should be rewarded
for your efforts. I mean,

524
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:34,770
I believe that in many of the
ideas that go behind capitalism,

525
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:38,310
where I think we fuck up is
with shit like the stock market,

526
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,770
things that can be
manipulated where you can on.

527
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,940
I got to talk to you about derivatives.
I got to drop some time attempts.

528
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,830
You all right. So, um, I actually
spent some time in Boston.

529
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:50,920
I spent four years at Mit, I think
around the same time you were there. Oh,

530
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:51,640
I don't know if I will.

531
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,570
I don't want too many comedy clubs when
I was there and was fucking awesome town

532
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:59,780
if it wasn't so cold. Especially
Cambridge. What a great place.

533
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,950
Right across from the necco wafer
factory on two. So three masses.

534
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,010
So you'd worked in,
do you understand the riveter?

535
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,510
Which I got a mechanical
engineering degree,

536
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:09,640
but I went straight to Wall Street
afterwards and worked in banking.

537
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,610
And then for the last 10 years I worked
in London and the credit derivative

538
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:16,450
industry, but worst of all derivatives.
So what is it? It's your gambling.

539
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,100
Ghanaians and driven as I was.

540
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:20,470
I was thinking about how I could talk
about this and I hear you talk about it

541
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:22,230
all the time.
So I figure I must be frustrating.

542
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:27,231
Like this room [inaudible] I have
friends that'll talk about Jujitsu,

543
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,260
you know like coy hoists. Gracie,
when he'd do just grab them,

544
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,640
we're just reach over and grab
the neck. I'm like no, he did it.

545
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:35,170
And it could be worse.
It could have friends.

546
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:40,040
You can have friends that took about
comfort ride, right? Oh No, I had a guy,

547
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,750
this is the worst shot out I
could ever give anyone. But

548
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,290
he said to me when he popped up with a
chat when he was like tried to talk to

549
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:50,770
Joe about cooking food cause I think yes,
some negative ideas and I was like,

550
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:52,750
look dude, I don't really believe
in [inaudible] through myself,

551
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,920
so it's going to be tough for me
to convince him. We just, you know,

552
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,420
it's not that Kung Fu doesn't work,
it's just,

553
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,700
it's definitely not the best way to go.
It's that simple.

554
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,240
There's a lot of stuff that works, you
know, if you back for someone in the face,

555
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,950
I mean it, it, it's
not going to feel good.

556
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,110
It's not gonna feel good to
get back fist in the face,

557
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,450
but it's not as good as you
fucking overhand, right. Somebody,

558
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:14,110
it's just not qualifiers. It's, it's
not that it doesn't work, it's just,

559
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:15,760
it doesn't work on the right people.
You know,

560
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:18,850
you can probably knock out an 86 year
old grandmother with the white crane

561
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:22,660
dancing tiger technique, but tried on an
MMA fighter. It's not going to happen.

562
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,730
Well,
it's also the way they practice it a lot,

563
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,250
the way a lot of people are practicing it.
I'm like, oh my God. Like you're, you're,

564
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:30,690
you're, you're being silly.
It's like you're strong,

565
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,460
a punch and then you're pretending
that if you threw that punch,

566
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:36,970
what I would do is that what you step
right here and then I would attack your

567
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:41,380
organs like this with a claw motion. We
would, come on, we just had, I'm Roger,

568
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,870
could I do that? That guy's got a
punch you again and again and again.

569
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:46,330
He's going to kick you in the Dick.
It's going to be a lot of shit happening.

570
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,570
You're not gonna have time to get
off that claw claw to the liver.

571
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,660
We just had Roger Gracie in the studio
on Friday and he was talking about,

572
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,940
we were rubbishing off Kung Fu and karate,
something bad.

573
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:55,631
We're going to get some hate.

574
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:59,020
But he was talking about the Kata and
have you get good at the cocktail.

575
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:02,590
You get your belt. And he was like, but
in Jujitsu you spa and you haven't test,

576
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,700
you can put a choke on someone,

577
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:05,530
but what about if he doesn't
want you to put it on?

578
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,470
And he just was kind of breaking down
some of the core differences. Yeah,

579
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:14,260
there's a big difference. I have a black
belt in taekwondo as well in taekwondo.

580
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,690
There was guys that were black
belts that weren't that good.

581
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,030
They just weren't that good.
They had been around a long time.

582
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:22,360
They'd take their forms and they,
they did okay and sparring,

583
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,640
but the reality is they
weren't really black belts.

584
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:27,880
They'd never reached that expert level.
Like they could get mugged.

585
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:30,940
Someone can kick their ass like they
really weren't adept at fighting.

586
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,620
Do you know what I find
is very interesting Joe,

587
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:34,000
which you might appreciate these.

588
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,930
If you look at some of those
more ridiculous martial arts. Um,

589
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:42,920
you see a guy like 45 or 55, you see
digital guy at that age, he stopped,

590
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,990
he still rolls. He's like
he's in shape, you know,

591
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,450
but you see one of these
guys and without fail,

592
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:52,451
every single 45 year old plus traditional
martial artist is the guy who's got

593
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:56,300
like a slouch and a beer belly and you
can see he hasn't done a pushup for like

594
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:57,890
15 years. You know what I mean? Yeah.

595
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:01,570
Those like Uci Rue guys and
the weirdest thing poisons.

596
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,590
They want to be called by some weird title
as well. You said it was in the face.

597
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,720
He pulled up like some
weapons on Facebook.

598
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:11,060
There are any tall guy with a backpack
and you're like, look at his face.

599
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,290
It's not a Jujitsu black cause he didn't
have the lines on his face like all

600
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:18,260
those hard because he doesn't take
himself. He just hides behind,

601
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:21,740
like he gets his belt where it gets a
certificate and he says, okay, that's me.

602
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm this grand master.

603
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:25,490
And then all the little students bow to
him because I think he's got mystical

604
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:28,130
powers, but at the end of
the day he's not progressing.

605
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,030
He's not progressing in his art
and just makes my blood boil man.

606
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,940
For those who don't know what nick is,
her Jujitsu black belt. Yeah, there's,

607
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,400
that's what Jujitsu is all about,

608
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,600
exposing reality and there's a lot of
martial arts that are about putting on a

609
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:44,660
show. It's really kind of
completely contrary to Jujitsu.

610
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:50,050
It's why in taekwondo had a big impact
on me as a child because in doing

611
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:55,070
something that was difficult in taekwondo,

612
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,940
it was like the first character forming
thing that I did as as a person.

613
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,060
But there's a lot of cult aspects to it.
You know,

614
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:06,320
the bowing and the calling, the,
you know, the instructor sir,

615
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:08,050
and always bowing to them.
They were just like this.

616
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,250
None of that shit's in Jujitsu. The
respect is all like real, legitimate,

617
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,820
natural, friendly respect.
Like John John Machado.

618
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,090
I have a black president and John
Jack as well. And John Jack is,

619
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,260
he's not just like a great Jujitsu coach.
He's like everyone's friend.

620
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,530
He's like a really nice guy.
So he's very informal,

621
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,680
but it's no one ever like disrespects
him or no one ever takes advantage of

622
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:36,500
that, that friendliness
and thinks that you know,

623
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,040
that they would be a better fighter than
him or they can kick his ass sparring

624
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:43,180
or something like that. Yeah. But karate
guys will always have to put on not,

625
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,960
and I don't want, I don't
want to say always because
a lot of, um, it's just, uh,

626
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:50,930
it's, it's done correctly and it is a
discipline and it's all about, you know,

627
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,090
maintaining, you know, the, the,
the, the, the sort of, uh, the, the,

628
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:58,100
the mindset of the Zen
martial arts practitioner.

629
00:34:58,101 --> 00:34:59,690
There's a lot of people
that are legit about it,

630
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,830
but there's also a lot of people that
they just want to put up a fucking dog and

631
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:08,270
pony show so that you don't challenge
them and test them and then they develop a

632
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:11,810
fucking job. I got a great story for
you. We'll get back to derivatives.

633
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,180
Don't worry,
I'll leave it at that.

634
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,010
So when I first started grappling and
Cape Town, it was right before the,

635
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,760
just off the first year I've seen it
was just starting to be understood about

636
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:26,570
functional martial arts. And um, if you're
the guys at the club where I trained,

637
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,360
they were, they were going
around, they just wanted to learn.

638
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,460
So they going to every martial
arts club they could go,

639
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,300
they could find and just just testing
the instructor and seeing what they could

640
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:38,000
learn from him.
That's what they get to Ninjitsu

641
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,220
school.
And um,

642
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,470
is that, by the way, what is Ninja
too? It's what I want him to learn.

643
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,020
When I was a kid and I looked
at martial arts magazines,

644
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,780
I was trying to pick out martial arts
to learn before I practice anything.

645
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,480
I was like, it'd be pretty good
to be an engine. I just alcohol.

646
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,760
But I needed something where
you could get a black belt.

647
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,070
That's one of the reasons I wanted karate
first. I wanted to get a black buddy.

648
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:57,510
Get it.

649
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,070
You don't even know who's the best ones
and they all dress the same I need about

650
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,470
Matt.

651
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:06,330
So, um, so they get to this
Ninjitsu school and they say
to the guy, you know, we'd,

652
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,600
we'd, um, we'd like to spar with,

653
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,460
you'd like to see your
system and what you can do.

654
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,210
So you said you will wait until after
the class. And so they were like, okay.

655
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,320
They stuck around and watch
them walk on their hands,

656
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:21,460
whatever it is you do and you do to class.
And then at the end of the class,

657
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:26,040
the instructor said, he said,
students, we have a challenge.

658
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,680
And what he did is he
took out a blind fold.

659
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,350
You Walk to the center of the Mat
and he knelt down, crossed his arm,

660
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,500
we'll put the blindfold on Christ his
arms and then said to them, my buddy,

661
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:40,300
he said, attack me. I sweat.
I couldn't make this up

662
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,760
again though.

663
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,710
For my buddy looked around the room
looking for a camera. He was like,

664
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:50,330
this has gotta be like some kind of joke.

665
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,170
And then he just kind of ran rod to
the back of him and put on a rear naked

666
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:57,710
choke and this guy like squealed and
didn't know what was going on and

667
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:00,020
eventually like the guy let him go.
And that was,

668
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,580
that was the end of
Ninjitsu for our training.

669
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,350
Yes. Well it was really nice about it
cause he could have just punted him in the

670
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:07,184
face.

671
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:12,190
It's nice that he had kick fucking
shogun style 2004 no it's dead.

672
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:16,940
He decided to choke him and that's a very
nice guy cause he couldn't just run up

673
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:20,630
and just need the fuck out of his face.
Or what was your modem right?

674
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,800
Yeah he's silly. Mitch what do you do
at attack me? Oh my God, you're crazy.

675
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,310
There's a lot of dudes
who got mad at me online.

676
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:31,760
A lot of these black dudes that do Kung
Fu in New York cause there's like a

677
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:35,480
whole culture like from the warriors
that kind of there. But those guys fit.

678
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:38,420
Most of it's fake Kung Fu.
When I say fake Kung Fu,

679
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:40,970
it's like a lot of their doing.
They're making shit up. Like,

680
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,490
what if you did like this? Oh
man, you can't do like that.

681
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,190
Look at how much you've
got exposed like this area.

682
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:49,670
I'm attacking your knee here silent
like you got, you got problems here.

683
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,280
I've got a tiger cloth
to the side of your neck.

684
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:55,970
Your whole side of your neck is wide open.
Like they talk to them completely.

685
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,080
I like watching. I laughed
my ass off at him. Look,

686
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:02,600
these guys want to believe that they're
real martial artists and they're really

687
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:04,910
mad at me like, and the
guy was like, come on son.

688
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,950
You tell me if I hit you in the facial,
the monkey pod, they wouldn't hurt. Yeah,

689
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,731
yeah.
If you,

690
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:12,260
if I let you hit me in the face of the
monkey part would probably be hurt.

691
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,470
But the crazy, that's not what I'm
saying here. What I'm saying is you're,

692
00:38:15,471 --> 00:38:18,200
you're practicing some nonsense kid.
All right.

693
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,840
But we all have aspects of our life
in which we're deluding ourselves.

694
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,120
You know what I mean? Just probably
kind of identify them like, oh,

695
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,360
for them it's martial arts. For
us. It may be you, I don't know,

696
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:26,700
relationships or whatever.

697
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,220
Yeah.
People love to dilute themselves.

698
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:33,450
It's way easier than facing
the insignificance of
your reality in this crazy

699
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:36,040
picture of the whole unit.
It's a mechanism for

700
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,630
the brain.

701
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,750
The ego's therefore to give you a
reason to stay alive until you can get

702
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:44,290
enlightened enough that you no longer
need the ego to appreciate this existence,

703
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,450
but the ego is there to keep you alive.

704
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,450
You're super special when
you're a fucking a 10 year old,

705
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:52,750
you know your ego sense. That
makes so much sense. It's just a,

706
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:57,751
it's an engine to push you forward and
then from there it's all about getting

707
00:38:58,391 --> 00:39:00,680
enlightened to the point.
We no longer need the ego,

708
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,930
the ego to enjoy the existence, but that
doesn't happen in the way that joy does.

709
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,450
So you just, you can do it. I did it.
I mean, I'm not perfect, but I'm, I'm,

710
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:12,160
I'm certainly way more evolved than
I was when I was a younger person,

711
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,740
but what was that? Through training
or through psychedelics or both?

712
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,810
All of the above. Jujitsu
for sure. Helped Jujitsu,

713
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,920
how I'm been doing Jujitsu since
[inaudible] 96 and I think just getting

714
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:25,930
constantly fucking strangled and going
at it until your heart's going to explode

715
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,630
in your chest and you're trying
not to tap. But you know,

716
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:31,180
you got to realize you've got to tap
and then you've got to go again because

717
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:34,120
there's still four minutes left in the
round and you're fucking, you know,

718
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:38,200
you're going out and you develop these
intense relationships with people because

719
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:42,100
you understand their character.
You know, you see dudes that break,

720
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,140
you see dudes that will never break.
You know,

721
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:46,620
guys that are so tough to tap and the,

722
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:49,810
and you know guys who are above monster
out of the gate but then they run out of

723
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:51,100
gas. You know, that's me.

724
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,800
No, that's even one level up.

725
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:57,300
It's like I'm in Jiu Jitsu
instructor and then, um,

726
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,690
I dunno if all digits instructors have it.

727
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,340
I'd love to hear some
from some of the others.

728
00:40:01,341 --> 00:40:04,610
But you know when all your students are
watching and it's like that young tough

729
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:07,100
20 year old kid and he's the
top purple belt and you're like,

730
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,250
and you're tired and you've got to
carrying an injury or something, you know,

731
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:12,830
you got to put it on the line of these
buckets aren't going to respect you

732
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:15,130
anymore. It's true. It's difficult.

733
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,500
Have An,
you know what the reality is,

734
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,190
there's a lot of instructors out there
with Marcello Garcia comes to their

735
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:23,680
school, they're going to
get tapped so they have to,

736
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,620
they have to figure out what to do here.
Do I just let everybody know? Yeah,

737
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:30,880
Marcella can tap me and this is how watch
me get treated like a baby. You know?

738
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,210
I mean,

739
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,840
a lot of people have a real issue with
that and then there's a lot of dudes that

740
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:36,750
say, you know, okay,
now I'm an instructor.

741
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,390
Like I have to make sure I'm lifting
weights. You know, I have to,

742
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:44,320
I have to be bigger and stronger. Like
Eddie Bravo talks about that. Like, he's,

743
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,130
he fights for his life when he's in,

744
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,470
in those classes because Eddie's
at such a high level right now,

745
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:55,450
especially his guard. His guard is fucking
so nasty. I rolled with a lot of dudes,

746
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,580
but he's one of the few guys,
him and Danny,

747
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,730
then one of the few guys that consistently
catch me from their guard and the,

748
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,730
that's how fucking hard to
catch someone from the chairman.

749
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,560
I got a role with you. Yeah, seriously
do. Maybe Thursday, Thursday. Cool.

750
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,450
Um, but uh, yeah, come to 10th
planet. I loved how you guys. Um,

751
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:18,250
I think that, uh, when you, when you
do that on a regular basis and you tap,

752
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,520
you tap people,
you get tapped you to strain.

753
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:26,521
Yuh Yuh Yuh Yuh Yuh Yuh blow through
all the energy that you have in,

754
00:41:27,271 --> 00:41:31,810
in a, in a, in an endeavor,
especially one that's so primal.

755
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,130
Jujutsu so life, death, you know,

756
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,450
even though you can do it and no one
gets hurt, it's the craziest thing, man.

757
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,050
You don't have this, this
theory, that Jitsu. Um,

758
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,520
I reckon you would know more about someone
after a 10 minute Jujitsu match than

759
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:47,660
a 10 minute conversation,

760
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:52,880
10 hour conversation character
be 10 fucking years. You know,

761
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:55,640
there's certain dudes where you tap
them once and then they're done.

762
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:59,330
You own them. You could just run right
through them. Even if they're not tired,

763
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:02,240
they just start giving stuff up.
You know, you see it, you see like,

764
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,910
and you're like, come on man, pull
your arm back. You know, put your arm,

765
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,210
Tuck yourself, you've got to
protect yourself is get that leg,

766
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:11,000
that leg and you'll start walking
through it. You don't want them to break.

767
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:13,190
You want them to like to
build up and you know,

768
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:15,890
you want them to like offer
legitimate resistance.

769
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,560
And that's what sparring supposed to be
about. That happened to me in Brazil.

770
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,130
I went down as a white belt and I was
training Gracie Baha and like all week I

771
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:25,460
was getting my ass tapped out as a white
belt and then Friday was no gay day and

772
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:27,050
I showed up obviously with no bell.

773
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,650
And I started rolling with this one dude
and I tapped him like six times and I

774
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,200
think he just didn't know who I was.
And after that first time,

775
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,990
after that first happy it was
over. Yeah, it can happen.

776
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,450
And then there's dudes are like,
I remember this guy man,

777
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,710
this guy just started doing Jujitsu.
He was as crazy Armenian dude.

778
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:43,820
I mean he had just started,

779
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:48,821
he was just learning techniques and he
would spar with anybody and this fucking

780
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,280
guy just would not tap.

781
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,660
He would fight to the death and
watching him roll with people. I'm like,

782
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:58,070
check this motherfucker out.

783
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,590
Like you would think he was
done and he would just die.

784
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,250
I just fucking struggling flat.
And he wasn't strong and he wasn't big.

785
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,950
He was just fucking proud.

786
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,980
It's shit and bound and
determined not to tap.

787
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,220
Not necessarily the best way to go
about it. And he had to get over that.

788
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:14,990
You gave us some respect. I'll fuck. Yeah.

789
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:18,530
Well I remember watching him because
it was one of his first classes and you

790
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:20,840
know, it's really, it's fascinating to me.

791
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,880
Fascinating to me watching people
just start Jujitsu. You know, the,

792
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:31,360
the Jujitsu digital guys were the
modern day jet I nights. Yeah. You know,

793
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,820
like Hixon would be like
the Yoda equivalent. Do you
know what I mean? It's like,

794
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,460
it's, it's kind of cool when
you think about it that way.

795
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:40,940
We have people who take ourselves to
the limit. Do you know what I mean?

796
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:44,780
And that's why there's such a
comradery between Digi two guys.

797
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:47,270
You know what I mean?
Like you know so much about it.

798
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:51,400
You do to guy when you shake his
hand. Yeah. Yeah. I think, um,

799
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,750
I think you have to ha,

800
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:57,540
I always talk about how well like Jujitsu
guys have control of their ego and

801
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,370
it's like, it was very rare you run into
Jujutsu guys completely out of control.

802
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:04,250
So many of our early guests were actually
Jujitsu guys cause it was who we knew

803
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:05,550
for London real.
And I'm like,

804
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,110
it must have had eight of them and the
guys and they were all just these cool,

805
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,070
grounded, pretty humble. Dude's still
smart, still excelling in their field,

806
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:16,050
but they were just, I don't know how they
get their checked on a regular basis.

807
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:19,970
That's what it is, man. It's
getting checked on a regular
basis. It's, it's huge.

808
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:22,940
It's so important. It's what I
said about the ego, your ego.

809
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:26,310
It leads you to victory.
It leads you to,

810
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:29,930
to want the glory and the accolades,
but ultimately a fucks you.

811
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,130
If you fight with your ego,
everybody knows

812
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,010
that you know you'll, you'll lose
your composure, you'll get crazy.

813
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:38,520
Especially if you start getting tagged,
you'll instead of fighting smart,

814
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:41,730
you'll just fucking flail back.
You'll try to attack back,

815
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,070
which is oftentimes the
total wrong approach.

816
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:47,250
Like you have to do the right thing
technically, so you have to, if you,

817
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,150
if you're going to do the right thing,

818
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:50,340
technically you have to be in
complete control. Your Ego,

819
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:54,300
you can't even let that factor into
the process. Look at it as a game.

820
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,300
You can sense that. I
mean his presence, he is,

821
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,270
we interviewed him on our show the other
day and one of the things I brought up

822
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:05,030
was I've known him for almost 10
years and Joe, I swear to God,

823
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,740
I've never seen him lose his cool.

824
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,690
He is the most zen person on the
planet or the one Muslim person I know.

825
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,050
And um,
it goes hand in hand with good Jujitsu.

826
00:45:15,051 --> 00:45:17,300
Like I noticed the calmer
I'm getting as a human being,

827
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:20,720
maybe it's good to the aging of
meditation, the better my Jiu Jitsu is,

828
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,820
the more I'm in touch with reality when
I'm like sparring with someone. And uh,

829
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,060
I find that interesting.

830
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,240
I do as well.

831
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:32,241
I think Jujitsu is an excellent part
of daily life for a man especially.

832
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,860
And I think it's just one aspect.
The other is our nutrition philosophy,

833
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:41,040
thought conversation, conversation
with others. You know, I know this,

834
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,840
this podcast for sure.
You know,

835
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:45,720
people talk about how much
this podcast has helped them.

836
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:50,190
What's helped me too because it's helped
me really review a lot of the ideas

837
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:55,050
that I have in my head and my, my take
on things. And, and really, uh, in, in,

838
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:59,610
in projecting it out to other people
and or broadcasting it out to people.

839
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,420
You,

840
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,420
you also are forced to sort of take a
real account of all your thoughts and it's

841
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:09,000
sort of like teaching Jujitsu, which
your game better. He learned by teaching.

842
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,570
If you teach Jujitsu, man, you're going to
empathize, right? Yeah. My friend Brent,

843
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,220
perfect example was always like a
decent purple belt. Always a, you know,

844
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:21,180
but he,
he wasn't like the best guy and man,

845
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,890
he started fucking teaching,

846
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,180
he's a black belt now but he started
teaching and when he was teaching within a

847
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,460
year,
his game went up so many notches.

848
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:31,530
Like all of a sudden he
was dangerous as fung.

849
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,410
All of a sudden every time you rolled
with them he was snatching Camorra's

850
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:34,831
you're like,
oh,

851
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:39,000
this is like he's doing this perfect like
we had the tech is technique became so

852
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:39,834
sharp.

853
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,830
Do you know why that is?

854
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:44,190
I actually find out the other day because
I noticed that as well when I started

855
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:47,040
teaching full time. I've got, I've
got quite a lot better and we have,

856
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,270
I don't know if I'm
using the correct term,

857
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:52,620
but this specific kind of neuron in our
brain that fires when we see someone

858
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:54,990
doing something, it's, I think
it's called an empathy neuron.

859
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,780
And so when you're a teacher,
you watch your students in a,

860
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,030
I don't know about your process
when you teach them a bit. For me,

861
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:01,920
I watch what they do and I kind of,

862
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,770
in my mind I overlay
what it should look like.

863
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:09,090
There's like a mental video overlay and
then eventually I'll show them what to

864
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:10,050
do and they'll do it correctly.

865
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,100
And it's kind of like me doing
the technique again. Does
that make sense? Yes. So,

866
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:14,550
um,

867
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,040
I guess that's what's happening when you
watch someone else doing something or

868
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,690
if you just involved in the process,

869
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:20,340
that's where you can get
better watching fight video's.

870
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,500
Absolutely. Yeah. And having knowledge
of what to do already in your head,

871
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:30,110
like having especially patterns.
Like the other day I was in, I,

872
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:34,300
I had this guy in side control and he
tried to get up to one knee and as he

873
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:37,930
tried to get up to one knee, I took
us back and it was all in one second.

874
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:42,550
The whole thing was like, you know it all
just like, you know, it happens. Like you,

875
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:46,510
you, you couldn't think if even if
you were like an athletic person,

876
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,050
you wouldn't be able to do it
like that because you know what,

877
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,080
what's happening is your mind
is being bypassed. Your Buddy,

878
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,120
my parents first coach always said to me,
he used to say,

879
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,120
your body knows what to do
but your mind gets in the way.

880
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:02,630
And that's when that happens for
me is the most beautiful. So crazy.

881
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:05,530
Cause it happens and it's
really is like magic.

882
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:09,220
It's like all the sudden you
got this dude's back. Gosh,
you know, it's like, and,

883
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,090
and, and especially if you freak a
guy out, like he's like, Holy Shit,

884
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,960
I just got to get my back like that. Like
Marcello's my favorite example of that,

885
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,020
when you watch like
Marcels arm drag to back,

886
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:24,830
there's a moment where these guys can't
even believe this motherfucker got their

887
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:29,720
back so quick. Like how did he do that?
You know, my buddy, my friend Alexis, um,

888
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,530
he's a high level black ball now.
This is one of those guys a little bit,

889
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,670
a little bit skinny,
you know like so,

890
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,610
but he's reasonably his leg but he's
not like an Olympian, you know, so he's,

891
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:42,580
he's quite a fragile guys light. It's
like 150, hundred and 60 pounds and he,

892
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,720
he's so God damn technical
like he is literary like,

893
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,030
like a surgeon wielding the scalpel.

894
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:53,500
And he told me he went to train with
Marcello and he said, he said to me, nick,

895
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,930
I swear to God it felt like that man
was reading my mind. Every move I did.

896
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,230
He knew if I went to put my hand down to
get my balance, cause it off balance me,

897
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,920
he had grabbed my hand and then he had no,

898
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:05,760
I'd reached to counter with
the other hand and he'd read,

899
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,280
have already have something queued up.
She said it was like reading my mind.

900
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,160
He robbing him. Yeah. No, I've
never rolled with him. So I mean,

901
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:15,340
just think like for a high level
blackball to say that about my solo.

902
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:19,420
Isn't that exciting? We can all one day
get perhaps close to that level. Yeah.

903
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:22,240
The best guys I wrote
with John Jacques Machado,

904
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:23,380
a role with him pretty regularly.

905
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:29,110
I've rolled with Eddie Bravo a bunch
of times of course. And uh, he's,

906
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,380
which, and Denny Denny proper goals
was one of Eddie's black belts.

907
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:34,420
He's got a nasty guard
and he's on small dude.

908
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:37,350
He's only about 160 pounds and he's still,
yeah.

909
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:42,070
And he's still contact me from the
guard regularly. He's wicked. Yeah,

910
00:49:42,071 --> 00:49:43,220
there's a lot.
He's got a,

911
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,740
Eddie's got a lot of guys that just have
stupid guards should get keys and other

912
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:49,860
ones. This dude. And he's, you
know, 135 pounds. What do you enjoy?

913
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,290
You like her card or a
pastor or what's your style?

914
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:58,350
I've changed much more over the years
and tried to be much more guard oriented

915
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:03,220
and half guard oriented and earn,
earn top position. You know,

916
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,620
because I,
most of my game,

917
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:10,090
most of my submissions were from the
top and I realize that's unrealistic.

918
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,910
Maricio um, I mean, he's a seventh,
he's a red and a red and white,

919
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,020
red and black belt. So I mean this guy
is legit. And he said to me, I said,

920
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:22,180
when I was up quite a bit younger,
I said like, man, you know,

921
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:26,380
Merito I thought about it like I don't
want to play on my back because if I'm on

922
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:27,900
my backup,
just trying to get to the top anyway,

923
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:30,080
so why don't I just go straight to
top? And he said, you know, Nick,

924
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:33,570
when you get older you'll see you'll need
your God, you'll need it. Cause it's,

925
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:37,030
there's much more energy conservation
when you're on your back. And, um,

926
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,340
I didn't think about it, but all I
get, you know, I kind of see that,

927
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:43,420
I know what he was talking about. I like
to earn it, you know, that's what Eddie,

928
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:45,650
he says if you're going to
attack someone from the top,

929
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:50,210
you should earn that position. So I
always start off from guard a 10th planet.

930
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,830
Well I've been injured, I've been injured
for five months. I fucked my backup.

931
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:59,930
And what I tried to do was I tried to
just like a lightly role and he's like an

932
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,390
asshole. Even though I knew
it was injured, I was like,

933
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:07,280
I just like roll with like guys, no, go
hard. And then I fucked it up way worse.

934
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:12,340
And the one day where I tried to look
rolled light set me back three months.

935
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,640
Then I came back and I only trained for
a couple of days and I popped it out

936
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:19,320
again. But it was much more
mild this time. It was,

937
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:22,850
it just a bad muscle tear and a,
it's in my back.

938
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,900
It's where a year like in
between your shoulder blades,

939
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,380
like that's where I tore the muscle is
just really weird. It was a Jujitsu thing.

940
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,330
Are you gonna be rolling to,
you're like 65 do you think?

941
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:34,940
Or later you'd be like Helio
Gracie till the wheels fall off

942
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,320
rolling until the wheels fall off.
I mean,

943
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,240
I've got to say it was nice during the
five months that I was off where I didn't,

944
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,820
I was, it wasn't always tweaked.
It was always like my elbow,

945
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:50,750
like I should have tapped from that
and I muscled out of it or my neck got

946
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:54,770
tweaked or it's always something I
don't know about you. But um, for me,

947
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:57,020
and I'm sure from a few other
GC guys, you know, when you,

948
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,510
when you get to the end of a hard week
of training and you're just fucked,

949
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:03,670
everything hurts. And you've got
that like bone tiredness. Yeah, yeah.

950
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,860
I used to like fight against it,
but now I kind of get off on that.

951
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:09,500
Do you know what I mean?
I feel like in my body I'm alive.

952
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,080
Do you know what I'm saying?
Well, you also feel like you've,

953
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,190
you've earned relaxation. You've actually
done something incredibly difficult.

954
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,460
Like I had a great role last
night and, uh, I came home,

955
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:21,890
this is my third time back
from the injury and I'm like,

956
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:25,520
I'm finally like pretty sure that
it's, it's, if it's not 100%,

957
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:26,720
it's definitely 90%.

958
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:30,350
So I'm feeling great and it was just
fucking exhausted and I just plopped down

959
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:34,100
on the couch and watch TV, but I didn't
feel guilty at all about watching TV.

960
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,950
You know,
it's like I did something pretty fucking,

961
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,980
I put forth some serious effort and I
don't feel like I can enjoy like bullshit,

962
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:46,670
like fucking off, like watching
TV or something, unless
I've done something hard.

963
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:50,160
I feel like you should reward
yourself with bullshit like,

964
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:55,190
but it's all a matter of managing
it. You know? It's like, I like to,

965
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,600
I like to watch TV or watch a movie after
I've written for a few hours, you know,

966
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:03,520
or I just like, okay, I did
my work. I can just shut off
now, man, I can't do it. Joe,

967
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,850
you know, just telling Brian the other day
I sold my playstation in my TV. I just,

968
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,090
I realized I don't want it in my
house anymore man because you know,

969
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,750
it sounds a bit strange but I always
feel kind of empty after watching TV or,

970
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,320
and it's not porn, um,
or playing video games.

971
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,680
I don't feel like I've grown as a person.
I feel like it was just like,

972
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,890
like a vegetable,
you know?

973
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:24,890
And I'm happy to have it at the house
while there's a very different feeling

974
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:26,160
that get from playing video

975
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,210
games than I get from doing other
things that are difficult. Like pool,

976
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:33,360
I played pool, which is also a lot of
people would say is a waste of time.

977
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,000
You know? Like they always say
that if someone is good at pool,

978
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:39,380
it's a glorious results of a misspent
youth. You know, that's what you did.

979
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,730
That's what people describe
like a really good pool player.

980
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:46,650
But I feel that pool in a lot of ways
is a lot like Jujitsu cause it's a lot,

981
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:50,640
a lot about managing your nerves.
It's a lot about control of your body.

982
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:54,510
It's a lot about concentration.
It's not as fast paced, but it's,

983
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:57,000
it's pretty intense when
you play high level pool.

984
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:59,520
And so to me it's not just a game,
it's also,

985
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:01,350
there's a lot of exercise going on there.

986
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:05,610
There's a lot of exercise of control
and composure and then you know,

987
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:10,070
in striking the ball in judging
how hard to hit it, you'll,

988
00:54:10,071 --> 00:54:14,460
you'll literally are judging
how much energy you release,

989
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:16,800
your like controlling the effort.

990
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,710
And it's very important because you
can't hit everything full blast.

991
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:21,140
It's not like, you know, boxing, we,

992
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:22,640
he tried to knock somebody
out in the first round.

993
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,270
You could just get away
with all power punches.

994
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:29,510
You have to have a real good sense of
how likely or how hard you need to hit

995
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:33,450
that ball and you need to be able to
control that ball with the levels level

996
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:37,140
sticks. So you need to figure out
how to drive through it level.

997
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:40,410
As you're coming down. There's a lot
of thinking and weirdness going on.

998
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,240
If you look at it like if I'm from a big,
big picture perspective,

999
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:46,430
there's some philosophy Alan
Watts. And he says, yeah,

1000
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,840
I think he was around in the 60s,
the 70s. And he was saying how, um,

1001
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:54,160
you'll get these wealthy
people who they'll buy a huge
boat and then they wonder

1002
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:55,210
why it doesn't make them happy.

1003
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:58,840
And it's because pleasure
comes from the acquisition,

1004
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:02,800
the process of acquiring a skill. It
doesn't come from like a material object.

1005
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,320
And um, that made a lot
of sense to me. You know,

1006
00:55:05,321 --> 00:55:07,570
that's why like when you go
and you'd get on the mat,

1007
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,050
like now I find digits is the most fun
now that I'm a black belt because I've

1008
00:55:11,051 --> 00:55:13,420
acquired that skill and I
can just enjoy it. I'm not,

1009
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,190
I'm not trying too hard to get better.

1010
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:17,800
I'm just enjoying my skill and getting
pleasure from it. You know what I mean?

1011
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,000
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1012
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,200
Yeah. Like, you know, when
you, when you have a good role,

1013
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:24,540
like say you get in there with a good
purple belt or something like that,

1014
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:27,450
someone was real scrappy and you'd go
and you're countering each other and you

1015
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:29,850
attack and counter each other
and then you finally know,

1016
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:32,820
catch a dude with something and it's
like, man, you earn that shit. You know,

1017
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:33,880
it's a,
this,

1018
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,950
there's something beautiful about
pulling off a technique on an unwilling

1019
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:39,620
participant. You know, when you've,

1020
00:55:39,621 --> 00:55:43,590
you've figured out a way to bypass
his defenses and you get in and,

1021
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:48,240
and it's a fascinating game of intellect
and that's what people don't understand.

1022
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:51,660
It's not just a physical thing.
There's certainly physical aspects to it.

1023
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:55,050
Especially I feel them now because I'm
just getting back into Jujitsu shape.

1024
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,990
Cause even if you work out,
it's not the same.

1025
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,240
The only thing that comes
closest kettlebells,

1026
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,500
there's especially a kettlebell workout
called extreme kettlebell cardio workout.

1027
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,200
It's company called dragon door sells it.
And this,

1028
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,720
this motherfucker puts you through hell.
I mean,

1029
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:13,560
it's a light light kettlebell too.
He does it with a 35 pound kettle bell.

1030
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,020
And I would've never believed that someone
could give me a good workout with a

1031
00:56:17,021 --> 00:56:21,670
little pussy ass 35 pound weigh in
my bitch. Like where's the 70s son?

1032
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,040
Let me show you what the fuck is
up. But if I'm sure, how long was

1033
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,360
it? God, it's 20 minutes. 45 minutes
man. And by the end of 45 minutes,

1034
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:33,361
45 minutes with like a minute break here
and there in between sets it's Ruth,

1035
00:56:33,441 --> 00:56:37,720
the less it's ruthless,
your fucking legs want to die.

1036
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:38,890
It's like they're going to break.

1037
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:41,800
You feel like you're going to step and
your muscle is just going to fall off

1038
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:44,050
your leg. Like you've,
you've ripped it all apart.

1039
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:46,780
If you get through that 45 minutes
without Kettlebell, congratulations.

1040
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:51,490
You're a beast. Yeah. Brian's a big show
coming up. Well before I ask a trip,

1041
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,520
like Brian's like I gotta do my Kettlebell
workout in the morning because it

1042
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:56,590
puts you in a good mood and
tried to get in the right zone.

1043
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,570
It puts those endorphins going, man.
It, it fires up your system, you know,

1044
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:04,720
gets your testosterone production up
that when you're doing like re like they

1045
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:08,710
always say that the best exercises for
putting on mass or a full body exercises

1046
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:10,630
like dead lifts traditionally squats,

1047
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:14,890
things along those lines where your
whole body has to move as a unit far more

1048
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:18,850
effective for putting on like real size
and functional strength and like say

1049
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:21,890
just bench press or just curls or
something along those, you know,

1050
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:26,170
if you look at someone who is primary
supplemental training outside,

1051
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:29,560
did you too is um, bodybuilding. You
can see they just don't move, right?

1052
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,230
It's not the way the human body
was designed to move through space.

1053
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:35,410
You know that like they're
all luck through the chest
and shoulders and there's

1054
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:38,740
no like horizontal movement in their hips.
There's only linear movement.

1055
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:42,130
Cause if you think about you're
pushing like 400 pounds on a leg press,

1056
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:44,080
it's a very,
your muscles and your tendons,

1057
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:47,860
your ligaments and your bones get used
to working in a very specific direction.

1058
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:51,850
There's no like balance and a,
and flexibility in it.

1059
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:55,270
So I got a question about Aubrey when
he's on here and talking about all his

1060
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,020
crazy,

1061
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,050
like he boga I remember you and Brian
were listening to him talking about Yoga

1062
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,060
and you're like,
I don't ever want to do stuff like that.

1063
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,630
And when he talks about Iowasca is that
stuff that you guys just are like, never,

1064
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,030
I never want to touch that stuff.
Oh, do, I'll ask in a heartbeat.

1065
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,580
I'm not worried about
Iowasca I'm again seems, uh,

1066
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:15,820
I think it would be great for someone
who had real serious personality issues,

1067
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:20,050
substance addiction, substance
abuse issues. I don't have those.

1068
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,050
So I am, Hancock was talking
about the boat and he's like,

1069
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:23,980
I don't want to do it again.

1070
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,460
The closest I have to a substance
abuse issue is coffee. I love coffee.

1071
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:32,420
It's a powerful, you're
IOWASCA coffee. Oh.

1072
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,360
Oh. Will ask it at somebody's died the
other day from the supposedly, yeah,

1073
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:41,020
but they don't know if the
IOWASCA killed him. Pete. Yeah.

1074
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,550
Some of the showman
could have killed them.

1075
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,140
The sham cause the showman buried him.

1076
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,080
So who knows if he died
during a ceremony or you know,

1077
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:49,150
he might've been an asshole,
somebody about to kill them.

1078
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:54,550
You really legit. Sharman
like, like an old school. Yeah.

1079
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:58,480
He was in some movie before that and
like, yeah. And like a legit movie.

1080
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,620
And then apparently this kid's dead.
So it's writing that drag off. Now.

1081
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:04,660
One guy dies me while
he smoked cigarettes.

1082
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:09,410
Hilarious cigarettes kill 500,000
people a year in this country alone.

1083
00:59:09,411 --> 00:59:13,270
And he's like, well, it's fucking
Iowasca killed one asshole in Peru.

1084
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,820
Iowasca the drug that he said, it makes
you feel like you're dying in the home.

1085
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:22,160
Have. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck
that drug. I think we both said fuck

1086
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,810
that drug. I think, I think it's very
beneficial for certain people. I,

1087
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:31,670
I have a friend, my friend Ed who
runs a center down in Mexico, um, uh,

1088
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,110
ed class, one of the Lloyd Irvin's black
belts, um, great guy. And he's, um,

1089
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:40,280
he's, his whole life
changed because of Ibogaine.

1090
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:45,050
He took it and went down and he
had an issue with pain pills.

1091
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:46,070
He had got an injury.

1092
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:49,760
And like a lot of guys that get injured
and the doctor prescribing something,

1093
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:53,270
especially if you fuck up your back.
It happened to someone I know very,

1094
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:56,850
very well. It was a construction
worker hurt his back.

1095
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,720
Strong opiate, isn't it? It's terrifying.

1096
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,260
It's very terrifying that it's so readily
available that doctors will prescribe

1097
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:08,261
it so easily and that they're trusting
you to have control that giving you all

1098
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:09,650
these pills all at once.

1099
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,800
It's not like you go to the doctor and
every day he dispenses you a new one and

1100
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:16,220
it says, listen, I'll give you,
you want to get on Oxycontin,
I will give it to you,

1101
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:18,260
but you got to come to
me. I give you one. No,

1102
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:21,980
he used a whole bottle of 90 fucking
pills. If you want to take four at a time,

1103
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:23,960
you can take four at a time.
No one's going to stop you.

1104
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:27,350
So it's weird that we're in London.

1105
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:30,770
We don't have that readily
accessible opiate prescriptions.

1106
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,360
We have an incredibly hypocritical
society, especially in Florida, Florida.

1107
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,940
They would have done documentaries on it.
Um,

1108
01:00:37,941 --> 01:00:42,770
that show 'em the vanguard had
the, uh, the oxycontin express.

1109
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:47,771
It was a show dedicated just to
oxycontin where they showed that Florida,

1110
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,760
they have these ridiculous laws where you,

1111
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:53,030
I think they're trying to change that
now probably because of vanguard probably

1112
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:54,350
because of that oxycontin express show,

1113
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:57,500
but they have these things
called pain management centers.

1114
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:01,040
So say you come in and you
say, Hey, uh, you know,

1115
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,820
I hurt my back and uh, really it's fucking
painful. I can't even sleep. And like,

1116
01:01:04,821 --> 01:01:07,160
okay, well I'm going write you
a prescription for pain pills.

1117
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:10,790
And then you take it and you shut
that door and you open the next door,

1118
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,633
the same building.

1119
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,260
They're connected and that's the pharmacy
and they have your pain pills and it's

1120
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:18,440
all they have is that continue to
exist because there's corruption.

1121
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:19,303
And by the way,

1122
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:24,370
Florida is also the state that has
recently come under fire for hiring police

1123
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:29,030
officers to pretend to be high school
students, to get kids to sell him pot.

1124
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,030
They hired a 25 year
old woman who was hot.

1125
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,720
She was attractive to make friends with
a 17 year old boy who was an honor roll

1126
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:38,090
student. This kid tested
negative, by the way,

1127
01:01:38,091 --> 01:01:41,690
does it didn't have any pot in his
system, didn't do drugs, didn't have a,

1128
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,110
didn't have a record smug kit.
Just a kid. Yeah, just a kid.

1129
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:49,490
And she made friends with them and then
got him to sell her weed and then they

1130
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:54,200
had, they had him arrested and she
coerced him. I mean she's 25 years old.

1131
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:58,340
She's a woman. Okay. And she's dealing
with a boy and she's attractive.

1132
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,410
First of all,
that's completely unfair.

1133
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:05,330
The attractive woman have a massive amount
of power. [inaudible] oh boy. Ashley,

1134
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:09,530
over 17 years, especially in attractive,
attractive 25 year old woman.

1135
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:13,700
I mean that's a real woman and he smells
that when a boy would smell that and

1136
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:16,280
the affection for that woman
would be like super special.

1137
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:20,220
So you know what's funny is sickness.
But when I was younger, like my fantasy

1138
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,770
was an older woman. Then the older
you get it kind of switches around

1139
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,710
that are all,
as you get older and younger fantasies.

1140
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,410
Younger woman threw him for
a loop and he was like, oh,

1141
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,620
I just didn't know if you
were done. I thought you were
going to keep going. Yeah,

1142
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,550
yeah, I know what you mean.
Yeah. It's, that's a weird thing.

1143
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,280
But some dudes know there's like
the whole MILF market and porn.

1144
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:45,420
So goods are into like this really
dirty look and 40 year olds just fucking

1145
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:45,861
savage,

1146
01:02:45,861 --> 01:02:50,861
just cock monsters as four year old
fucking with Mascara of sweat nude,

1147
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:56,010
all that. A lot of those
videos dudes are into that now.

1148
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:59,790
It's women who just want to get
gorilla fucked. Older women are just,

1149
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:03,270
they know what they want.
That's like a whole market dirty milk.

1150
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,570
What's pretty you pretty freaky mocket
as well. What's this movie called?

1151
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:09,830
Samsara recently.
The SQL to Berakah and um,

1152
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,920
you know it says a bunch of long shots
with no dialogue and they showed this.

1153
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,840
It was the most bizarre
thing I've ever seen.

1154
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:20,841
The sex doll factory and
then they juxtapose that
shot with one of those strip

1155
01:03:21,871 --> 01:03:25,780
clubs slash brothels in Thailand
and to make a point. And it,

1156
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:29,370
it showed you just how similar the
whole thing is the sex industry. I mean,

1157
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:30,301
do you know what I mean?

1158
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:33,150
Selling sex dolls and selling human
beings is pretty much the same,

1159
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,470
the same thing. And in that case, that's,
that's fascinating to are you guys,

1160
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:40,420
you guys move into Wester? No,
it was talking about here too.

1161
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,010
And you always talk about like what you
want to do with that squad and with the

1162
01:03:44,011 --> 01:03:46,650
podcast and I'm like, well, you know,

1163
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:49,450
I think you said recently you would like
feel a responsibility to kind of like

1164
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,830
take this to another level and stuff.
I'm just wondering what you meant by that.

1165
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:57,720
Well, um, the, the only thing
we're doing differently is one,

1166
01:03:57,721 --> 01:04:01,210
I have a new studio that I'm opening
up. It's closer to where I live. Um,

1167
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,660
and it's a completely independent thing.

1168
01:04:03,661 --> 01:04:06,030
It's not connected to a comedy
club and it's got a lot of space.

1169
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:10,320
So the idea is that we can have it set
up the way I would like to have it set up

1170
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:14,130
where, you know, have a nice
cameras and monitors on the wall.

1171
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,480
But you're not getting rid
of red band, right? No.

1172
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,530
I've had this motherfucker with me
for 10 years. I'm not going anywhere.

1173
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:23,220
He's Brian's one of my best
friends. I mean, he's not just a,

1174
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,610
and he's a weird
motherfucker, but you don't,

1175
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:31,640
you don't get some weird dude. He's
into Hitler cats. That's just, that's,

1176
01:04:31,641 --> 01:04:34,440
it's hard to find.
Hard to find.

1177
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:37,020
So he's an important element.

1178
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,890
So he's going to be placed where like
people hang out or is it going to get

1179
01:04:39,891 --> 01:04:42,390
studio? Oh, Brian's going to be with
me this weekend, by the way. Um,

1180
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:46,500
we're going to be in Phoenix at stand
up alive and it's going to be fucking

1181
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:50,160
crazy. Folks. Uh, Joey Diaz is there
a, he won't be there on Sunday,

1182
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:52,120
but he's there Friday and Saturday.
Um,

1183
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:54,030
and Ari Shaffir is going
to be there on Friday.

1184
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:55,500
Brendan Walsh going to be in on Saturday.

1185
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:58,240
Brian's going to be there the whole week.
We're going to have a fucking blast.

1186
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:01,230
But we haven't been a Phoenix.
Uh, it's been a couple of years.

1187
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,600
One of my favorite places like
that in Texas. It's a cool town.

1188
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:06,540
Did you hear they bought the other bus?
Yeah, they bought the Tempe Improv too.

1189
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:11,070
Good for them. You still get
nervous? I get excited, right? Yeah.

1190
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:14,730
Not Nervous. I'm looking forward to
doing it. I just, it's a, it's important.

1191
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:18,250
So I get excited.
I wouldn't say nervous with that

1192
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:22,940
implies like fear. It's not a fear thing.
It's like, it's an excitement. Like,

1193
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:27,070
uh, you have to be heightened.
You definitely, you can't
like go up nonchalant.

1194
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:29,350
Me People want to be entertained.
They want to be it.

1195
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:31,840
They want it to feel the
intensity of the performance.

1196
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:35,470
They want to feel the focus.
They want to be entertained,

1197
01:05:35,471 --> 01:05:38,910
so you have to be up for it. So it's
an exciting thing. It's not a nerve.

1198
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:42,490
But if I didn't do my job though,
I would feel fucking nervous.

1199
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,120
Like if I haven't been writing,
I don't know what to say.
And, uh, you know, there's,

1200
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:46,720
there's,

1201
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,460
there's a weird fear that
comes with trying new shit
and fucking around with new

1202
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:55,840
bits, especially if not convinced.
Like sometimes I'll have a bit and uh,

1203
01:05:55,841 --> 01:06:00,160
I'll start out with it and I'm like,
man, this bit is this my fucking suck,

1204
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:03,250
this pit my suck. This might have been
just one of those stone ramblings.

1205
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:08,200
And then I'll do it on stage and I'll
find a path and all of a sudden it becomes

1206
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:13,150
a monster. It's like onstage, it'll become
alive and the have to take that chance.

1207
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:15,670
Sometimes there's two aspects to writing.

1208
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:18,700
One aspect is the physical act of
sitting in front of a keyboard,

1209
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:21,670
writing in silence by myself.
There's that for sure.

1210
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:23,260
That's a very important aspect of it.

1211
01:06:23,261 --> 01:06:27,070
But the other aspect of it is
telling the story in front of people,

1212
01:06:27,071 --> 01:06:30,280
telling the bit in front of people
because then the motherfucker just comes

1213
01:06:30,281 --> 01:06:34,360
alive then. Then I know like I
was going to say it a certain way,

1214
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:36,340
but in the moment I got another one.
I don't need that part.

1215
01:06:36,341 --> 01:06:39,820
I need to edit that part out and just
get right to this part. Boom, boom.

1216
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:42,670
And it's a matter of editing on stage.

1217
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:47,680
It's one of the few art forms that
you must have an audience to create.

1218
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:52,420
You have to, I cannot create, I can,
sorry, I can start the process on my own,

1219
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:56,800
but I can't create the audience without
any audience. We'll do any, oh well,

1220
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:01,120
I mean hopefully a good one. But, um,
I can't create the standup. I can't,

1221
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:04,540
it can't become its full form
without the crown. It's impossible.

1222
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:07,080
I used their energy. That's part
of the equation, right? Yeah.

1223
01:07:07,081 --> 01:07:10,900
It's a part of the reaction is part of it.
The feel I get from him,

1224
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:14,050
the intangibles, like
as I'm saying it, the,

1225
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:17,590
where I know the timing lies and it's,
it's so,

1226
01:07:17,591 --> 01:07:22,390
it would be impossible to describe such
a specialized skill. It's a weird skill.

1227
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:26,290
It's a, it's, it's, it's see, cause it's
not, it's not what everybody thinks it is,

1228
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:28,090
man. It's not just your, you know,

1229
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:30,850
you're saying things and people are
considering what you're saying and they're

1230
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,040
laughing. Ha Ha. There's
a little bit of that.

1231
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,900
But there's also some
weird fucking connection,

1232
01:07:35,901 --> 01:07:38,830
some hypnosis thing that's going
on between the audience. Yeah,

1233
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,170
and as an audience member,
I feel it as well.

1234
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:44,380
Like when I watch someone who I
think is really hilarious, like a,

1235
01:07:44,381 --> 01:07:48,400
when I saw Stan hope recently or
when I saw a Joey Diaz the other day,

1236
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:52,960
like when someone is really killing
and you're locked into their bit, it's,

1237
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:53,681
there's a,
there's,

1238
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:58,681
there's this weird sort of a
connection and the you as a performer,

1239
01:07:58,751 --> 01:08:01,360
you feel that and then when you're coming
up with new shit, it's like you've,

1240
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:02,950
you'll feel where it goes and where,

1241
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,680
and they also feel when you're faking
it and you feel when it's forced,

1242
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,990
you feel like all these deals
and you know what they feel,

1243
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:10,840
you know what the audience feels.
It's like you're conducting this here.

1244
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:13,600
It's really a pure art form.
It's a fucking weird art form.

1245
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,210
It's typically a hard comedy course.

1246
01:08:15,211 --> 01:08:18,470
And I did five minutes in
London and so it was chippy.

1247
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:19,970
I mean I know a lot of people
hate on comedy courses.

1248
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:22,840
I know Marin hates on comedy
courses, but he shouldn't, you know,

1249
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:26,210
because it gets people in the door and
it gets them out of their shell. Right?

1250
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:29,960
Yeah. If you don't know anything about
standup, if you're not a standup comedian,

1251
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:34,070
you know what you, why not take a course
to get you to force yourself on stage?

1252
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:38,240
You know the real problem with courses
is a lot of them are run by the losers.

1253
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,531
That's the problem,

1254
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:42,170
but you need a funny guy to teach you
or do you need the guy really to get you

1255
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:43,790
on stage and then so
you can learn yourself.

1256
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:48,580
You're not going to get real comedy
advice from somebody who sucks. Yeah.

1257
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:51,170
I don't think it's okay.
They can't do it. Yeah.

1258
01:08:51,171 --> 01:08:54,320
There was a bunch of people that wrote
books on comedy and they were like,

1259
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:54,891
you know,

1260
01:08:54,891 --> 01:08:58,970
I remember as a young professional when
I had just started getting paid to do

1261
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:01,700
gigs, people would just laugh
at these books, but a horrible,

1262
01:09:01,701 --> 01:09:05,960
the comic who actually wrote the book was,
but what a book does do.

1263
01:09:05,961 --> 01:09:09,860
Even though I agree with that in certain
ways it does get you interested in the

1264
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:11,270
conversation.
It does.

1265
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:15,200
Like you might like go to the bookstore
and say how to be a standup comic man,

1266
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:17,210
I need a fucking find a
book on how to be a comic.

1267
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:22,390
And then that book might be step one
taking class might be stepped to 10 years

1268
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:25,900
from now. You might be Mark Marin, you
know, you might be a Mark Marin, you know,

1269
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:28,310
you might be a real professional comedian.

1270
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,110
It's just a matter of taking those steps.

1271
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:35,380
And so the good thing that a comedy class
does is that allows you to fuck around

1272
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:38,650
and get on stage and see if
this is something that you're
actually interested in.

1273
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,930
And, and, and just think about
the process of it. And by the way,

1274
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:45,200
when you're in a bad comedy class,
listening to idiots tell you how to do,

1275
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:47,990
you might be like, this guy's an
idiot and that might help your comedy.

1276
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,900
Like that might help you understand that
there's a lot of people out there that

1277
01:09:50,901 --> 01:09:54,560
do it terrible. Don't do what this
guy's doing. Don't hack it up up there.

1278
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:58,250
Don't make it so obvious. Don't insult
me as a person is watching, you know,

1279
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:01,280
like you might feel insulted and
that actually might benefit you in an

1280
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:02,360
educational sort of a way.

1281
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:05,840
Just kind of been sucked every week in
front of these people and we all bonded

1282
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:08,000
at the end cause like he's
12 strangers and it's like,

1283
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,570
if you can't make 12 random people in
London laughed and most likely you're not

1284
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:14,880
going to make a comedy audience laugh. And
we just got up there. I would just say,

1285
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:18,740
oh by the way, tomorrow night we have a
show here. We have a show here at the, uh,

1286
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:22,520
at the ice house. Um, Joey Diaz and
I were on the phone today. It's like,

1287
01:10:22,521 --> 01:10:24,920
what are we doing tomorrow, dog?
And I go, what do you want to do?

1288
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:27,590
Is we've got to do a fucking show.
We've got to do a fucking show.

1289
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:29,960
We can't come in cold
the Phoenix cause like,

1290
01:10:29,961 --> 01:10:31,520
we're not coming in cold to Phoenix dog.

1291
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:34,400
We got to give these motherfuckers
are Valerie's house a show. So I said,

1292
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:36,440
all right. All right, we're
going to do a show, sell down.

1293
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,310
Is it like breathing for you guys? You
guys got to be on stage, um, weekly. Well,

1294
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:44,870
Joey is, um, you know, Joey's
a guy who, no matter what,

1295
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,200
Joey's always doing three, four sets a
week. He's always hopping around doing it.

1296
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:50,840
He loves it.
It's one of the reasons why he's so good,

1297
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,680
so comfortable and natural up there.
And it's just also what he loves.

1298
01:10:54,681 --> 01:10:59,040
He's a real stand up, you know, he's
a, he's a black belt in standup comedy.

1299
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,390
He loves it. He loves it. It's the
same thing. So for him it's like,

1300
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:05,210
he knows that we're going to have
these huge crowds. It's Phoenix,

1301
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:09,530
the club is like 600 seats. So it's,
it's, and it's almost sold out.

1302
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:13,010
So it's going to be nuts.
Two shows Friday, two shows
Saturday and one show on.

1303
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,950
So Joey's just fucking ramping up
right now. He's fucking shadowbox.

1304
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,170
And in his house we
invited him on London Real,

1305
01:11:19,171 --> 01:11:23,260
but then he told us he doesn't
have a passport, so can't
go to London. Yeah, yeah.

1306
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:26,700
That sucks. That's too bad because a,
that would be awesome to have him on.

1307
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:30,790
It would, yeah. You guys could
experience the love you. Um,

1308
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,690
can you tell is someone who's like,
um,

1309
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,500
you're like a belt and some comedy as
well. So can you tell when you meet your,

1310
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,930
when you meet a new colleague appeared,

1311
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:43,620
can you tell if they're a natural or if
there's someone who had average talent

1312
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:45,270
and really polished it to a high degree,

1313
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,240
you could tell if they're a
douchebag and if there a douchebag,

1314
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,590
they're probably not
going to be that good.

1315
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,870
There's something I'm telling
you it's going to be fake.

1316
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,310
They're going to be clunky.

1317
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:57,420
And then there's some people you meet and
they're just so open. There's so like,

1318
01:11:57,421 --> 01:11:59,580
and you're like, Whoa, I gotta
see what this guy does on stage.

1319
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,810
You know what I mean? Like some
people you meet them and they're,

1320
01:12:01,811 --> 01:12:06,010
they're just really there and centered
and engage in you and you're like, oh,

1321
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,960
this is a sharp motherfucker. Like what's
going on when he's talking to you? Yeah.

1322
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:10,213
You know?

1323
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,790
And then there's other guys that are
like really quiet and then they get on

1324
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:15,360
stage and there a mother fucker.
You know, you never know. It's,

1325
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:17,850
it's people's personalities or strange.

1326
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:21,120
There's some people that are completely
different on stage and they are offstage.

1327
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,310
It's weird.
You know,

1328
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,000
in some people they're really
fucking funny on stage and
then offstage they just,

1329
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:30,080
you know, kinda quiet, reserved,
you know it's very strange.

1330
01:12:30,081 --> 01:12:35,070
It's like they get it all out in their
onstage antics. This, there's that too.

1331
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:36,930
There's a lot of
different types of comedy.

1332
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:42,080
The most taxing and exhausting is the
always on fucking one liner guy who's

1333
01:12:42,721 --> 01:12:45,660
always trying to like say
like the next funny thing.

1334
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:48,660
But you guys do crack jokes when
you guys are hanging out. Yeah,

1335
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:50,820
but only the ones that work.
Okay.

1336
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:54,240
You've got to know what's your,

1337
01:12:54,241 --> 01:12:56,400
it's the same thing we were
talking about being a black belt.

1338
01:12:56,401 --> 01:12:59,780
It's like you got to know what is actually
funny and you've got to know what is

1339
01:12:59,781 --> 01:13:01,480
just annoying to listen to.
You know,

1340
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:06,360
what is just you jerking off into the
wind and what is actually something that's

1341
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,080
relative, like something that relevant,
something, something relevant to bring up.

1342
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,360
Something that you're actually
contributing to the conversation. You,

1343
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,990
you took the term like one of the
things that Brian's really good at,

1344
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,030
and I wanna encourage this,
but I have to give him his props.

1345
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:22,050
He'll say some shit that I would have
never fucking thought up and I would have

1346
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:26,280
never said. And he'll interject them
in weird spots and it just like,

1347
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:30,000
it takes the conversation. Sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't,

1348
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:35,010
but it takes it to a place
that you probably would
have never gone on your own.

1349
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:38,700
And that's what's fun in
having a conversation.

1350
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:42,140
What's fun and having a conversation.
And what's fun in,

1351
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:47,340
in watching a standup comedian is someone
who can take shit to places where you

1352
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:51,720
know, you might not have gone, but
the relevant, they're relevant places.

1353
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:55,890
So it's like you allow them to think
for you for a brief moment. You know,

1354
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,730
you allow that. And when someone, when
they're, they're awkward and Clunky,

1355
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,280
you know, like you can't think for me
stupid like, what are you doing here?

1356
01:14:02,281 --> 01:14:05,380
You're bullshitting me.
It's like,

1357
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,310
so when you say that someone's exhausting,

1358
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:09,690
cause they're always joke yucking it up.

1359
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:11,980
Like they don't understand
how they're being perceived

1360
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:12,521
there.

1361
01:14:12,521 --> 01:14:16,840
There's a disconnect between what they're
projecting and what they're imagining

1362
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:19,100
their projecting or how they're
being received and what,

1363
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:20,950
how they're imagining
their being received.

1364
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,680
There's a disconnect
there and that that's a,

1365
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:27,550
that's just like the karate guy who
still thinks he's a master and he's got a

1366
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:31,360
gut now, but he wants everybody
to be terrified of him
and he really does believe

1367
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:34,180
somewhere in the back of his head
that he could fucking handle multiple

1368
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,430
attackers. You know,
he's, he's bullshitting.

1369
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,950
That's the scariest thing in life
is when you're confronted with,

1370
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:42,430
when your delusions are shown to,
you know what I mean? Thank you.

1371
01:14:42,431 --> 01:14:45,280
The Mac and then he'd just get the story
and that's why I told you not to eat

1372
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:45,790
that cookie.

1373
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:49,120
This motherfucker was trying to give you
have no cookies and you don't want to

1374
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:51,490
fuck with these edibles, man, edibles,

1375
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,340
edibles will put you in a bad place.
Miss you're ready foot.

1376
01:14:55,341 --> 01:14:57,340
It's very confronting.
You know? It's like,

1377
01:14:57,341 --> 01:15:01,570
it just confronts you with all the weird
shit that you've been pushed into the

1378
01:15:01,571 --> 01:15:04,090
back of your head and it's
like, I was Scott then. Well,

1379
01:15:04,091 --> 01:15:08,890
have you ever seen the information
on the difference between consuming

1380
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,860
marijuana?
Can you talk about anyone?

1381
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,950
Other cannabinoids change on the first
pass through the liver, right? Yeah.

1382
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:18,370
And the first pass through the
liver becomes 11 hydroxy metabolite,

1383
01:15:18,371 --> 01:15:20,530
which is this intense psychedelic drug,

1384
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:25,690
which is five times more psychoactive
than THC. So for a portion of marijuana,

1385
01:15:25,691 --> 01:15:28,210
like say what's in a pot brown,
it just,

1386
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:31,360
if you smoked it would
fucking get you high shit.

1387
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:34,840
But if you eat it like
it's almost uncomfortable.

1388
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:40,080
It's like so self examine
a Tory and so intensely,

1389
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:44,980
you know, probing to all aspects of
your fears and an unconscious thoughts.

1390
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,390
That's why you do it on a plane.

1391
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:49,260
You know what I was saying?

1392
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,840
I was in that I about five
years ago and someone gave me a,

1393
01:15:51,841 --> 01:15:55,440
Ronnie had never had one before
and he picked me up in the morning.

1394
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:57,510
So this is for you.
We want to wear to universal studios,

1395
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:00,650
which had never been to before. So I ate
this thing on an empty stomach and um,

1396
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,820
I got really paranoid and I chicken out
on the Shrek ride, man. Like I literally,

1397
01:16:05,821 --> 01:16:07,650
I lost it. I said, I gotta get Outta here.

1398
01:16:07,651 --> 01:16:10,810
There were all these mirrors
on the walls wailing and quote

1399
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:17,070
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt. I'm scared
of Shrek rise. That's a new meme now.

1400
01:16:17,071 --> 01:16:21,900
That's a meme on the Rogan
board. Brazilian Jujitsu.
Black belt. Scared of Shrek,

1401
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:26,500
right?
Yeah.

1402
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:27,843
Man

1403
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:30,190
needs a motherfucker sign nothing.
Nothing.

1404
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,870
There's a lot of people say
it makes you paranoid. And I,

1405
01:16:32,871 --> 01:16:35,840
I believe that a certain amount
of paranoia is very important.

1406
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:39,980
I really think it's not paranoia. I
think it's just sent me, how dare you.

1407
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:43,430
That ringtone? Yeah. Yeah. I
don't change ringtones, bitch.

1408
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:46,670
I don't want to hear your music either.
If you one of those dudes,

1409
01:16:46,671 --> 01:16:50,330
it's got some fucking latest.
Does Green Day have a latest song.

1410
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:54,540
They might have a bad ass ring
too. They enjoy you sexy bitch. Um,

1411
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,680
both sex hand the fuck were we talking?
I don't know,

1412
01:16:57,681 --> 01:17:01,370
but I've got to drop some
financial science on you. I
had an appointment though.

1413
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:05,540
You've planned your ring
tone. Oh, that's Kinda cool.

1414
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:07,940
If you get forgot that it certainly
wasn't worth talking about.

1415
01:17:07,941 --> 01:17:09,800
I was talking too much shit obviously.

1416
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,790
All right, so my job from long
science here. Yeah, it sure.

1417
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,990
Can we have it of science? Yeah.
I kind of look Trump a little bit.

1418
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:18,140
So I know you're always talking about
the crazy derivatives and how there's too

1419
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:20,870
many amount there and it's
betting on like fake stuff. Well,

1420
01:17:20,871 --> 01:17:24,710
what I talk about is that I really,
I'm a fucking idiot.

1421
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,750
I don't really understand it.
So if I'm saying it,

1422
01:17:26,751 --> 01:17:29,730
I'm just repeating some shit I
heard online. Fair enough. So,

1423
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:34,130
so I'll just like real break it down. Like
the oldest form of derivative is like,

1424
01:17:34,131 --> 01:17:34,291
it's,

1425
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:36,920
it's like what the Egyptians you steal
when they used to like grow some cotton

1426
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,090
and like they'd got,

1427
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:41,150
they'd know that they'd like sell it
for a future price and if they got a

1428
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:44,060
certain price they would plant the crops.
And if they didn't then they wouldn't.

1429
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:47,840
So that was like the oldest form and
then it kinda got crazy with this credit

1430
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:48,651
derivatives and stuff.

1431
01:17:48,651 --> 01:17:52,400
And it's more just like technology is
the way I look at it. Like an Ipad,

1432
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:55,460
you could say as bad if you like load
porn on it and give it to an eight year

1433
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:58,320
old. But in theory it's not bad stuff. Uh,

1434
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,810
the problem is is when it gets a
little unregulated and crazy. Well, a,

1435
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:06,811
I see your point and I think that what
you're saying is probably correct,

1436
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:12,820
but I think that if you want to
have a fair society and the society,

1437
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:14,601
that makes sense.

1438
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:19,160
I don't think you can have things
when it comes to money and finances.

1439
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,950
I don't think you can have things
that can be manipulated in any way,

1440
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:26,951
shape or form or things that are based
at all on confidence or perceptions of

1441
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:28,700
how something is doing.

1442
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,050
So when I look at the stock
apples down in over the iPhone,

1443
01:18:31,051 --> 01:18:33,650
it was a lump and perceived as a little
fork on and we thought it was apple

1444
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:38,210
stock goes down. What are you even
saying? What the fuck are you even saying?

1445
01:18:38,211 --> 01:18:42,740
What kind of crazy world we live in,
where there's people,

1446
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:47,770
the regular people who are gambling for
and against a company falling apart,

1447
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:49,250
are doing well.

1448
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:54,170
And that's a part of our
society and that's a part of
our economy. That's crazy.

1449
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:55,700
Every time you buy something
and you're kind of gambling,

1450
01:18:55,701 --> 01:18:58,360
when you buy your house and wherever you
live, you actually were thinking it'll,

1451
01:18:58,370 --> 01:19:00,980
it'll probably be a good investment
as opposed to if you bought a house in

1452
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:02,480
Tiawana than it may be wouldn't.

1453
01:19:02,481 --> 01:19:05,720
So every decision you make with
your money is kind of a bit sure.

1454
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:08,750
If I was saying that you should
never gamble, that would make sense.

1455
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:09,860
But that's not what I'm saying.

1456
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:14,360
What I'm saying is you can't gamble on
shit that you're not even a part of and

1457
01:19:14,361 --> 01:19:18,080
that can't be a giant part of the economy.
You like when you,

1458
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:21,980
when you're buying stock and selling
stock and trading stock and things are

1459
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:25,310
going up and down,
the Dow is down seven points today.

1460
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:29,150
What the fuck are you even talking about?
You've got a shit system.

1461
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:34,330
If the Dow is down that if it's that
fluctuating up and down based on some

1462
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:38,730
stupid fucking build it gets
passed or some lack of cower.

1463
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,830
Iran has been rattling their sabers,
the Dow is down, you know, it's,

1464
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,980
that's a nonsense system. Humans are
all about confidence, right? If it,

1465
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:49,970
if someone's, if, sure. But our economy
shouldn't be based on such a weird,

1466
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:54,530
you know, a theorial sort of a
feeling like the idea that you know,

1467
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:57,780
whether or not people believe that apples
on the ride. What about blackberry?

1468
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:59,120
Why the fuck are block bar now?

1469
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,040
They were on top of the
world at one point in time.

1470
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,630
So it just seems like nonsense.

1471
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:06,270
It seems like piece of gold
should equal one donkey. Okay.

1472
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:10,410
Back to the old school until we
figure out how to have a, I mean,

1473
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,700
what was the guy's name? The young joc
fresco talks about resource based economy.

1474
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,560
That's the only thing that makes sense.

1475
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:21,740
Economies based on numbers and derivatives
and finances and stocks and bonds and

1476
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,790
why do you even saying,

1477
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:26,430
I just don't know how we're going to
get there without having a complete

1478
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:27,120
bloodbath.

1479
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,720
How are we going to get to a better
version of government without a complete,

1480
01:20:30,721 --> 01:20:34,230
you only say the Internet and that's the
only option we have right now. Right.

1481
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,280
I think that's,

1482
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:39,270
I think the Internet is eventually
going to be the governing of the world,

1483
01:20:39,271 --> 01:20:40,500
the governing of the world.

1484
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,260
It's going to lead to the governing
of the world through the people.

1485
01:20:43,261 --> 01:20:48,180
I think it's only inevitable as long as
people continue to have more and more

1486
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:53,040
access to information and more and more
power to distribute that information

1487
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:54,150
like we do right now.

1488
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:57,360
And that's one of the scariest things
about these tightening up bills when the

1489
01:20:57,361 --> 01:20:58,080
bill,
you know,

1490
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,160
when they're trying to stop the passing
these cyber terrorism bills and these

1491
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:05,040
sweeping legislation that allows the
government to come in and shut down

1492
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:09,090
websites and, and deem, you know,
enemies of the state, certain wet,

1493
01:21:09,091 --> 01:21:11,730
like wikileaks is an enemy of
the state. Now, Julian Assan,

1494
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:15,480
Julian Assange is deemed an enemy of
the state. They've decided he's as bad.

1495
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:18,810
It's al Qaeda. He's meanwhile,
all he's done is tell the truth.

1496
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:21,480
Always done is distributed information
that the government didn't want

1497
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:23,730
distributed. So they decided that
this guy's a fucking terrorist.

1498
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:28,140
Are you going to carry, I think it's
nonsense. I mean, as I get older,

1499
01:21:28,141 --> 01:21:31,560
I think it's more and more nonsense
and I think it's a silly system.

1500
01:21:31,561 --> 01:21:36,330
If Gary Johnson can't debate, okay,
what you got is you gotta rig system.

1501
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,390
You've got a giant crazy rig fake system.

1502
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:43,630
And if I pretend that I'm a part of
this stupid electorial college and,

1503
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,090
and hop on board, it's nonsense.
College is still crazy, right?

1504
01:21:47,091 --> 01:21:50,220
Every aspect of it is nuts.
Lobbyists are nuts.

1505
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,170
The ability to donate
corporation's ability to donate
limitless amounts of money.

1506
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,500
That's nuts. That's just this term,
this latest super pacs and all that.

1507
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:00,900
That's nuts.
It's weird watching it from London.

1508
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:04,640
It's really weird because it seems like
a big joke with Romney and Obama and it

1509
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:09,180
shows like a big guy. Myself Draconian
Mitt Romney on Facebook last night. Joe,

1510
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:13,080
good for her. It was like a
nice guy. I liked him too.

1511
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:16,050
It doesn't mean that would vote for
him and even if you vote for him,

1512
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:20,030
I think it's been pretty obvious with
Obama that it's not that easy. Um,

1513
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,600
and what Obama's done.

1514
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,750
Everybody thought that Obama was going
to be this great savior, this country,

1515
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:26,420
and it's going to, you know,
I mean, I remember her,

1516
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:31,260
this woman who was a like all happy
when he won it and now I know that my

1517
01:22:31,261 --> 01:22:34,110
mortgage is going to be paid and now I
know that I was listening to her say it

1518
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,040
was like,
Whoa,

1519
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:39,810
you want to talk about some
high expectations for someone
who's going to come in

1520
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:44,550
and you think he's going to
fix this incredibly fucking
entangled corrupt system,

1521
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:48,750
not of his hands, Matt fix it, but
he let some shit get past that.

1522
01:22:48,751 --> 01:22:52,170
I would have never thought that the
National Defense Authorization Act,

1523
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:55,650
which allows the military to
break up civil descent they met,

1524
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,780
allows the military to
be used on US civilians.

1525
01:22:57,990 --> 01:23:00,750
It allows people to be
held without authorization.

1526
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:05,380
It allows to be w without
rather representation, without
any recourse. You can't,

1527
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:06,310
you can't have a trial.

1528
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:09,460
They can just hold you indefinitely
as long as everyone is terrifying.

1529
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,130
It's terrifying. They would
ask for that. Here's why.

1530
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:15,940
It's not like things have gone
horribly bad in this country.

1531
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,410
It's not like there's riots in the
streets every day and people are

1532
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,930
assassinating government leaders and
there's bomb blowing up and buildings

1533
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:27,370
everywhere and we have resorted to like
some sort of arcane law that we're going

1534
01:23:27,371 --> 01:23:29,890
to have to put into place
until we can calm things down.

1535
01:23:29,891 --> 01:23:31,820
We've got to control the,
no, it's not that, but cool.

1536
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:35,170
Walk down the street Pasadena.
It's beautiful out here,
man. Get on the highway.

1537
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:37,600
There's a few. Too many cars.
People are civil. You know,

1538
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:40,120
you've got hours and hours of bumper to
bumper traffic and the worst thing is

1539
01:23:40,121 --> 01:23:42,250
somebody might blow the horn and
stick a finger out at somebody.

1540
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,740
No one's cutting people's heads
off with swords. You know, it's,

1541
01:23:44,741 --> 01:23:48,910
it's not necessary to pass
these crazy Orwellian laws.

1542
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:52,780
But what it makes me think is that they
can see the writing on the wall and they

1543
01:23:52,781 --> 01:23:55,750
know that this form of
running governments,

1544
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:00,320
it's no longer valid. It doesn't
work. It's ridiculous. We,

1545
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:03,970
we understand your influence,
we understand why you're
making these decisions.

1546
01:24:03,971 --> 01:24:06,880
We see where the money comes from now.
It's all readily available.

1547
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:10,960
It's not like we're living in 1930 and
I have to read the Hearst newspapers to

1548
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:13,210
find out what the information is,
you know,

1549
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,640
is going to be about
this upcoming election.

1550
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,560
You can find out anything
about anybody. It's, it's,

1551
01:24:17,561 --> 01:24:21,550
it's really different now and it's not
saying that we don't need a government.

1552
01:24:21,551 --> 01:24:24,490
We certainly need to government. It's not
saying we shouldn't have corporations.

1553
01:24:24,491 --> 01:24:26,030
Of course we should have corporations.
I,

1554
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:28,660
there's a lot of corporations that I
think are great. I think Apple's great.

1555
01:24:28,661 --> 01:24:31,210
I think Porsche is great.
I think I like their products.

1556
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:33,790
I think you know what I mean? I,
there's nothing wrong with that.

1557
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:38,970
It's just we can't allow money to
supersede humanity and that's what they've

1558
01:24:40,211 --> 01:24:40,600
done.

1559
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:45,600
They've allowed the idea of doing their
stockholders justice and making as much

1560
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:47,440
money as possible.

1561
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,670
They've allowed that to supersede humanity
and when you have businesses where

1562
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:56,050
their entire function is to supersede
humanity, you can see that and you can,

1563
01:24:56,051 --> 01:24:59,650
you can measure that, that we need to
stop that. That needs to be closed down.

1564
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:03,370
They got to stop it for themselves because
they're all having fucking horrible

1565
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:08,220
Karma from that, you know?
And yeah, that's gotta be
best comparable man. If you,

1566
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:10,750
have you thought about having
politicians on the show? A few.

1567
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:13,000
We've got a guy that young David Seaman,

1568
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:15,760
he's coming back again when the couple
of weeks want to come on your show or we

1569
01:25:15,761 --> 01:25:18,760
go, why don't we get one, two, maybe
Gary Johnson would, but he's, you know,

1570
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:21,250
he's legit. You know, I spoke to Ron.

1571
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:23,290
Paul had a chance to speak
to him on the tonight show.

1572
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:25,540
I never asked him to come on the
podcast because I thought it would be

1573
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:28,660
ridiculous. Siemens comes in. He wouldn't
come on. Yeah, he's coming on again.

1574
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:34,110
But you have problem with that.
No, I said Siemens. How dare you

1575
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:38,050
fucking child. There you go.
That's what you're talking.

1576
01:25:38,051 --> 01:25:42,120
Exactly like the needle off the records
of my manchild barking in the distance

1577
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,020
to put your credit Joe.

1578
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,600
So this is our one year anniversary pretty
much since for you guys to show. Yeah.

1579
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:50,410
And I mean obviously it was, it was
pretty much after watching your show.

1580
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:52,330
I mean the splitscreen
was pretty much an owed.

1581
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,760
He used to shoot it I think
at your house, right? Yeah.

1582
01:25:54,761 --> 01:25:58,120
Well we started doing it because
of, uh, Anthony coolio. Really.

1583
01:25:58,121 --> 01:26:02,700
He was the big push. I mean,
when, uh, we went to, um, uh,

1584
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,830
the Anthony show and Anthony has a show
called live from the compound and he was

1585
01:26:06,831 --> 01:26:08,960
the,
he actually has a fucking six set up.

1586
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:13,280
He has a green screen and a broadcast
desk and really high end microphones.

1587
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:16,610
And Him and his buddies would get
drunk and do a show. And we were like,

1588
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:19,970
me and Brian were like, Dad looks fun.
Is it video as well? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1589
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:23,360
So we started doing it all.
It'll be three years for us in December.

1590
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:27,260
We started doing it on just on a
Ustream, on a, on a, on a laptop.

1591
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,030
And you guys were on sofas,
right? And then, yeah,

1592
01:26:29,031 --> 01:26:30,920
we didn't in my house
just chilling at my house.

1593
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:35,600
We were bored when you're infected us
over in London, you know. Well, you know,

1594
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:37,400
like I said,
we were infected first.

1595
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:41,630
We've come up with this idea
called global real. And we want to,

1596
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:45,110
we want to facilitate the setting up of
like some of the things in real in every

1597
01:26:45,111 --> 01:26:48,020
major city in the world or anybody
who wants to just do a podcast.

1598
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,600
We've talked to some guys actually
in Victoria, British Columbia.

1599
01:26:50,601 --> 01:26:51,950
There's a guy over there,
Eric Faust,

1600
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:54,680
and we talked to him recently on Skype
and he's like, I want to do a podcast.

1601
01:26:54,681 --> 01:26:57,320
I'm like, just do it. You
know, if you want some help,
let's do it. And he's like,

1602
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:00,260
I want to call it Victoria real with
your permission. And I was like, dude,

1603
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:02,940
that's awesome. I know the
name, you know, but I was like,

1604
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:06,230
this is not another London
real. You're good. Right.
We'll have to bust. This is up.

1605
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:12,770
There can't be enough podcasts right
now. I don't that I, I, you know,

1606
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:16,310
there's a lot of people that feel like
the other people that are doing podcasts

1607
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:20,600
or somehow or another, the competition.
I don't feel that at all. I never have.

1608
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:24,320
I feel like there's 300 million fucking
human beings just in this country and

1609
01:27:24,321 --> 01:27:29,150
hundreds of millions worldwide that
also listen to anything English.

1610
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:31,390
I think this is a huge
audience for everybody and I,

1611
01:27:31,391 --> 01:27:34,900
I don't think that it has
to be us against them. I,

1612
01:27:34,901 --> 01:27:38,720
I'm inspired by other comedians just
like I'm inspired by other podcasts,

1613
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:39,763
but I'm a big,

1614
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:45,730
I'm a big believer in the way to be
successful in the way to feel good is to

1615
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:51,350
help other people, to help other people
do things mentality though. Yeah.

1616
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,350
That's one of the first signs of an
enlightened human being as he knows is

1617
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:57,830
enough for everyone. He doesn't have to
claw and scrape and say, this is mine.

1618
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:58,310
You know?

1619
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:01,760
And once you start sending that energy
out into the universe to experience

1620
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:05,900
becomes very, very different.
Right. I think my standup comedy,

1621
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:09,980
all of it has benefited from that. My
life has benefited from it. I'm just to,

1622
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,530
I think you have to be a generous person.
I'm like,

1623
01:28:12,531 --> 01:28:16,410
I'll regularly go to a coffee shop and
leave like a hundred dollar tip. I just,

1624
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:20,870
I think you've got to do that. I think
I leave like a little happiness bombs.

1625
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:22,550
Like I always joke a joke about it.

1626
01:28:22,551 --> 01:28:26,690
Like my friend Duncan and I were we a
eight at this barbecue place and uh,

1627
01:28:26,691 --> 01:28:29,870
you know, a tip, the waiter a hundred
bucks and he didn't even know it.

1628
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:32,330
But with laughs, thanks. Bye.
And I'm like, get out of there.

1629
01:28:32,331 --> 01:28:35,300
Like I love the fact that dude's going
to open up the thing and see a hundred

1630
01:28:35,301 --> 01:28:38,570
bucks, motherfucker just give me 100
bucks and you're gone mad and I'm gone.

1631
01:28:38,571 --> 01:28:41,120
So happiness bomb, you know, it's uh,

1632
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:46,010
and I think that that sort of mentality,
I've also put that to stand up, you know,

1633
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:51,230
and all of us would do that already does
that, Duncan does that. Brian does that.

1634
01:28:51,231 --> 01:28:52,490
Joey Diaz does that,
you know,

1635
01:28:52,491 --> 01:28:56,420
we're the first guys to tell you about
someone that we think is great and

1636
01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:59,360
someone that we'd love something
you should check out and uh,

1637
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:02,070
it's aided all of us. You know what
you get, what'd you give you get back

1638
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:06,090
10 times, right? That's a little bit,
yeah, I think so. Man. I've, you know,

1639
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:09,480
there's a lot of comics who bring guys
on the road with them that are terrible

1640
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:10,590
so they don't show them up.

1641
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:15,660
I've always been of the mindset that I
should bring the funniest human beings

1642
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:20,661
that are available so that the shows
better and it makes me laugh like I don't,

1643
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,960
I'm not, it's not going to make me less
funny. Like that idea is crazy to me.

1644
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,990
Like there's a lot of people that actually
want the person who's on in front of

1645
01:29:27,991 --> 01:29:30,690
them to not be funny because
then it makes them look better.

1646
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:34,950
And I think that's that mean if you,
if that's the worst way of thinking ever.

1647
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,510
Because that's your,
so your,

1648
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:40,200
your sense of what it's funny or what's
funny about you is so delicate that no

1649
01:29:40,201 --> 01:29:42,540
one else can also be funny.
Like that's crazy.

1650
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:46,020
Like sometimes you're funny but you're
only funny if someone before you sucks.

1651
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:48,840
That doesn't even make sense. It's a
hold of the wrong mentality. Same thing.

1652
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:53,850
It's a lack of that abundance mentality
and a lack of the real idea that human

1653
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:59,550
beings are inexorably connected,
that we're connected by energy.

1654
01:29:59,551 --> 01:30:03,850
And that we're connected by intent and
then we're, we're connected by the,

1655
01:30:03,851 --> 01:30:07,240
the thoughts that we put out there and
the thoughts that we received from,

1656
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:12,090
from other people. There's, it's
not, it's not this woo woo thing.

1657
01:30:12,091 --> 01:30:13,920
This is a real exchange of energy.

1658
01:30:13,921 --> 01:30:16,890
And I've been impressed by
the power of a conversation.

1659
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:20,610
Like we get on on the air once a week
and we have an hour conversation with

1660
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:23,310
someone who we think is important and
that's why we put them in the center of

1661
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:25,440
the screen. We want to feature
these people to the world,

1662
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:28,830
whether it's Simon Powell with a
siliciden solution or you know,

1663
01:30:28,831 --> 01:30:32,210
an MMA fighter or somebody and
say, check this dude out. But it's,

1664
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:34,110
it's had a big effect on me.
I mean,

1665
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:36,270
I've grown so much as a
person this last year,

1666
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:39,120
it's probably been the best year of
my life and this is like 10 years in

1667
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:41,610
financial markets and
making money and doing this.

1668
01:30:41,611 --> 01:30:45,510
But like this last year I've changed the
most I can drink Iowasca two years ago

1669
01:30:45,511 --> 01:30:47,160
I would have been the
dude that glazes over.

1670
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:50,600
When you talk about psychedelics and
like, oh, you're one of those fucks. No,

1671
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:55,380
and now I'm doing it. And like he
made you, what made you uh, have a,

1672
01:30:55,381 --> 01:31:00,180
an an altering of that idea? You know,
I walked away from that job because I,

1673
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:04,300
I dunno, I think a lot of times as young
males were sold this kind of, this,

1674
01:31:04,301 --> 01:31:06,990
this capitalist promise, when you
go to school, you make the money,

1675
01:31:06,991 --> 01:31:09,970
you get the girl, you have the car
and you, and you're happy. And I'm a,

1676
01:31:09,971 --> 01:31:10,890
a lot of our viewers,

1677
01:31:10,891 --> 01:31:13,980
I ain't got the same way that like these
guys in their mid twenties that think

1678
01:31:13,981 --> 01:31:16,710
they're playing the game and they're
like, okay, then we're all my rewards.

1679
01:31:16,711 --> 01:31:19,650
And they're like, I'm not happy with
this anymore. And I think I got there,

1680
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:20,820
I was doing this day in,

1681
01:31:20,821 --> 01:31:25,350
day out job and it was quote unquote
successful and I had all the trappings and

1682
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:28,080
then I was just like, I wasn't
happy. So I just walked away from it.

1683
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:32,700
Scared as hell wouldn't it with
nothing to do for six months.

1684
01:31:32,701 --> 01:31:34,320
I was like literally not doing much.

1685
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:37,890
And Nick and I would meet in the west
end and walk around London for like three

1686
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:41,220
hours and I was listening to your
podcast and we walk and we talk about

1687
01:31:41,221 --> 01:31:45,360
philosophy and women in finance and
perspectives. And at the end I'd be like,

1688
01:31:45,361 --> 01:31:49,950
nick, that would've made a fucking good
punk if we had just recorded it, you know?

1689
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:53,580
And then Nick's like, let's do it.
Let's do it, let's do it. And then um,

1690
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:55,200
there like arrived at Brian's house.

1691
01:31:55,201 --> 01:31:59,500
I thought it was going to be us like
talking into garageband and fines up this

1692
01:31:59,501 --> 01:32:03,790
huge studio and there's a microphone in
my face and that's awesome. It was cool.

1693
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:04,451
And we got the cameras.

1694
01:32:04,451 --> 01:32:07,660
I thought the video was super important
because I listen to audio podcasts

1695
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:10,780
before, but you need to seek guys
faces. And I always say for our guests,

1696
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,750
people need to see at least the first
five minutes because they need to see if

1697
01:32:13,751 --> 01:32:16,330
their account or not or
if there are a Douche.

1698
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:18,910
And you can tell after five minutes of
looking at someone, I think you can say,

1699
01:32:18,911 --> 01:32:22,180
okay, I like this guy's vibe. And
then you can listen if you want.

1700
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:24,010
You can tell from listening to,
you know,

1701
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:26,590
I was listening to the opiate Anthony
Show and there was a guy on, I was like,

1702
01:32:26,591 --> 01:32:31,090
man, this guy sounds like a cunt to
me. Like they're being nice to the guy,

1703
01:32:31,091 --> 01:32:33,880
but I'm like this guy sounds like a douche
bag. So I asked a friend and knew him.

1704
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:37,840
He goes, oh, it's a piece of shit. I
go, oh thank you. I go cause I was like,

1705
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:39,910
this guy is playing these guys.
I was like,

1706
01:32:39,911 --> 01:32:43,360
there's something about this
guy that is so disingenuous.

1707
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,180
And as soon as I asked my friend, I knew
it was like, oh he's a piece of shit,

1708
01:32:46,181 --> 01:32:50,740
a fucking hate that guy. I was like, thank
you just by listening, by listening man.

1709
01:32:50,741 --> 01:32:53,020
But I agree with you about the video,

1710
01:32:53,021 --> 01:32:58,021
but the reality is the majority of our
listeners are audio only more than 70% I

1711
01:32:58,931 --> 01:33:02,950
think. Is it really 90%
yeah. We have a big butt.

1712
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:06,250
I say I was more like 60% I'd say.
Well between Stitcher, which is,

1713
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:10,390
are you guys on stage, isn't it?
It's cool. It's a cool service.

1714
01:33:10,391 --> 01:33:14,260
Don't tell bill burr.
Stitcher is a one,

1715
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:18,070
one great way that we're distributed
through smart phones. But now there's the,

1716
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,650
you know the iPhone
app on the new iPhones,

1717
01:33:20,651 --> 01:33:23,650
they have a podcast app and
we have our own podcast APP.

1718
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:26,950
You can find the Joe Rogan experience
podcast APP. It's free. Um,

1719
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:31,180
but the audio version is where people
like listen to it on the train or in their

1720
01:33:31,181 --> 01:33:35,290
car or the gym or whatever. I think
that's much more, more prevalent.

1721
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,140
Very few assholes are sitting in
front of the computer watching.

1722
01:33:38,141 --> 01:33:40,840
I usually watch the first few minutes
just to take a look at the guests and then

1723
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:45,070
I switched to audio. We got gifts by
the way. Might as well drop these guys,

1724
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:49,510
these things on you guys. You have
gifts for us. How dare you. I know, huh?

1725
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,920
Hopefully you brought batteries for you
and that's for you, right Ben? Oh, no way.

1726
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:55,600
Brian,
did you say that with a gay accent?

1727
01:33:55,601 --> 01:34:00,060
You son of a bitch and that's
some crazy ass London real

1728
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,830
now it's actually some posters.

1729
01:34:02,831 --> 01:34:04,570
I didn't have any wrapping
paper that going on at Sun.

1730
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:06,510
We've got to get wrapping paper.
That's kind of cool, right?

1731
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:08,710
Swabbed wrapping paper,
face mess. Come on dude.

1732
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:13,300
You can put that up to the camp squad
wrapping paper. I'm telling Ya, this guy,

1733
01:34:13,301 --> 01:34:15,670
whoever you where that came
with the higher primate tattoo,

1734
01:34:15,671 --> 01:34:20,671
this guy had the dopest fucking one of
my tee shirt designs on his shoulder.

1735
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:25,510
The Sheba one. Uh, he had it done on the
shoulder by this wicked tattoo artists,

1736
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:28,600
whoever you were,
you've solved fucking son of a bitch.

1737
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:32,140
That was a bad ass tattoo dude. You've
got pride gloves for me. He goes,

1738
01:34:32,141 --> 01:34:36,190
are some originals where
they used? No, that was uh,

1739
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:40,150
I went to pride I think is no five
at Japan and never been used. So,

1740
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:44,500
and then Robin's got the classic English
pride gloves are actually better,

1741
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:47,600
better than the gloves that the
UFC uses in one way. Is that the,

1742
01:34:47,601 --> 01:34:51,040
the padding goes more over the end of
the fingers and it kind of keeps you

1743
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:54,310
curled. I feel like there were less.
I pokes and pride. Do you feel that?

1744
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:57,740
But I can remember. I don't remember
a single eye poking pride is awesome.

1745
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:58,110
That was

1746
01:34:58,110 --> 01:35:02,750
fun. It was awesome. I still love it.
It's cool. It was such a crazy time.

1747
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,130
Those fights were nuts,
man.

1748
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:07,700
Like there's no other organization that
would have put on minute Toro versus Bob

1749
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,830
Sapp. It was a great fight.
That was craziness, man.

1750
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:13,410
I mean it was like they
were almost superheroes.

1751
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:14,960
Don't know what we're talking about.

1752
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,970
Minotauro is this guy who's like
the original Jujitsu heavyweight,

1753
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,030
the original guy,
the first guy really to come along,

1754
01:35:23,031 --> 01:35:26,810
start submitting high end guys from
his back. Nobody did that before.

1755
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:29,210
Minute Toro and he fought
this guy named Bob Sapp Bush.

1756
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:33,590
Literally 370 pounds all muscle.

1757
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:38,800
He was fucking ridiculous and it was a
crazy fight where Bob's sab pile drived

1758
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,910
Minataro at one point in time,

1759
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:45,620
Meta time was more than a hundred pounds
lighter than a more than a hundred I

1760
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:47,810
think he's probably 150
pounds lighter than them.

1761
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:53,000
It was craziness and he slapped the arm
by arm and arm bar at the end and caught

1762
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:55,690
him in an arm bar. Spoiler
alert, sorry. As proper upset.

1763
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:58,760
Probably couldn't extend his arm
more than that. So it was ridiculous.

1764
01:35:58,761 --> 01:36:01,250
Bob Sat was so big,
he didn't look real.

1765
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,070
He made so much money in Japan
endorsing products and stuff.

1766
01:36:04,071 --> 01:36:05,200
He made millions of it then.
Yeah.

1767
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:08,750
But then the market kind of fell
apart from what I understand.

1768
01:36:08,751 --> 01:36:10,680
We're going to get ensign
anyway on the podcast.

1769
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:13,370
Last time instance in America
have him, yeah, he's great.

1770
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:17,210
Went into Fukushima until the good stuff.
That was one intense dude.

1771
01:36:17,211 --> 01:36:21,540
That guy is the real
deal. And he uh, you know,

1772
01:36:21,541 --> 01:36:23,960
he was there during the whole,

1773
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:28,070
like the height of pride and
he was also there when it,

1774
01:36:28,071 --> 01:36:29,030
when it dropped off.

1775
01:36:29,031 --> 01:36:32,000
So He'd probably be the one that could
tell you what the fuck really happened

1776
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:35,450
when he comes on the podcast. Maybe we'll
get it from him. And James Thompson,

1777
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:38,900
he was in involved as production, right?
Yeah, the Colossus. Yeah, he's on my,

1778
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:42,560
met my message board now and he's,
uh, he writes a lot of blogs.

1779
01:36:42,561 --> 01:36:46,010
He's actually a very good writer.
Okay. Really interesting cat. You know,

1780
01:36:46,011 --> 01:36:49,340
cause he's this big scary
looking motherfucker but he's
actually a really wealth,

1781
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:54,020
well thought out, well spoken guy. And
he sent us a message the other day,

1782
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:58,550
he sent me Mr. Smith Facebook and I was
like, I can't be the same. James Thompson,

1783
01:36:58,551 --> 01:37:02,060
he's a great guy, man. Cool. Hi James,
I'm going to get back to you. Like I said,

1784
01:37:02,061 --> 01:37:04,790
he's on, he's on my message board
all the time. He's a great guy.

1785
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:07,220
MMA guys are cool dudes. Yeah, it's,

1786
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,610
I think it's along the same lines
when we talked about with Jujitsu.

1787
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:14,720
The only difference with them and May
of course is that you have to consider

1788
01:37:14,721 --> 01:37:16,570
thank you very much for his gloves
by the way. You were awesome man.

1789
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:20,020
You have to consider
with MMA, um, the, the,

1790
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:25,100
the potential for longterm damage to your
mind. You just have to consider that.

1791
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:28,880
And so these guys always have that
sort of hanging over their head.

1792
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:32,540
And I think that's one of the reasons
why you really can't enjoy it.

1793
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:36,430
Like you can enjoy Jujitsu, like
Jujitsu. Even when you, you,

1794
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,820
you tap somebody,

1795
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:41,040
you don't feel bad because you get
tapped to everybody taps you just,

1796
01:37:41,041 --> 01:37:44,420
just part of the whole game. It's
like he needs to learn that, you know,

1797
01:37:44,421 --> 01:37:48,110
you can't put your arm there if the
guy's a got your back and he's got the,

1798
01:37:48,111 --> 01:37:51,260
you know, he needs to learn what he did
wrong in that position because you see,

1799
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,300
it's not like if you got
hydro in that position,

1800
01:37:53,301 --> 01:37:55,770
you've could have tapped him or you know,
you know what I mean?

1801
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,750
It's like it's a lesson for everybody.

1802
01:37:57,751 --> 01:38:01,170
So you don't even feel bad
about delivering the lesson
because if you're trying

1803
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:02,100
to get good at Jujitsu,

1804
01:38:02,101 --> 01:38:06,030
ultimately you should welcome getting
tapped because it exposes you.

1805
01:38:06,031 --> 01:38:09,000
You're your true weaknesses,
otherwise you're really not going to know.

1806
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,820
And the only way to get better
is to see those weaknesses,

1807
01:38:11,821 --> 01:38:14,330
shore up those holes and move forward.
So someone who taps,

1808
01:38:14,331 --> 01:38:18,840
he was actually helping you. And that's,
that aspect doesn't exist in kickboxing,

1809
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:20,520
kickboxing man.

1810
01:38:20,521 --> 01:38:24,150
You only have a certain ratatat tat that
you could take to your head. You only,

1811
01:38:24,151 --> 01:38:26,610
you'll have a certain number man.
And when you deliver,

1812
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:28,680
especially when you deliver
on a sparring partner,

1813
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:31,440
there's part of you that knows
that you just did some damage.

1814
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,360
When you uncork a right hand on someone,

1815
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:36,060
you see their eyes roll back in
their knees buckle. You know,

1816
01:38:36,061 --> 01:38:39,570
you just fucked that guy's consciousness
up for us to live smarter these days.

1817
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:41,220
I know Mac,
Dan was here talking about that.

1818
01:38:41,221 --> 01:38:43,800
Do you think a lot of fighters have
had that new philosophy of I'm going to

1819
01:38:43,801 --> 01:38:47,500
train smarter, not harder. I think
some of them have certainly. Um,

1820
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:52,080
but some of them don't have as a access
to the most tactical trainers. You know,

1821
01:38:52,081 --> 01:38:53,580
there's some trainers,
like there's this,

1822
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:56,520
the Matt Hume's of the world who
have you watched their fighters.

1823
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,070
There are fighters are so
obviously well trained,

1824
01:38:59,071 --> 01:39:03,390
very obviously technical Winkle.
John's fighters are also very similar.

1825
01:39:03,391 --> 01:39:06,960
Like you, there are super
obviously, well technically trained.

1826
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:10,080
You Watch cowboy Cerrone
move, you know, you watch, um,

1827
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,470
what Jon Jones is learning.
He's,

1828
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:17,540
these guys are learning
very good technique and the
only way to truly do that is

1829
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:22,590
to be taught by someone who
is at the front of the game.

1830
01:39:22,591 --> 01:39:24,600
Someone who really knows
what the fuck is up.

1831
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:29,520
Someone who has a super technical
standup game and knows how to,

1832
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:34,500
to move a fighter through progression,
challenged them and test them and, but,

1833
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,480
but not have them get mall,

1834
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:40,290
not have them get beat up and figure out
a way to balance all that out because

1835
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:44,190
it takes one bad punch and like, yeah,
you'll never be the same fighter again.

1836
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,560
Yeah.
I've seen guys that especially kicks,

1837
01:39:46,561 --> 01:39:50,040
I've seen guys that got kicked in the
head and we're never the same and that is,

1838
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:53,430
that is 100% real, especially, um, like,

1839
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:58,660
like there's certain kicks like wheel
kicks and things along those lines where

1840
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:03,290
there's an insane amount of power. Like
if you look at Lens on your head, right?

1841
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:08,180
Edson Barboza versus Terry Edom, fine.
We're, we're Edson Barboza Knock Terry at,

1842
01:40:08,181 --> 01:40:12,450
I'm out with the wheel kick in
Brazil. I mean, it was walkin nasty.

1843
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,360
I mean the heel connected
right to the jaw,

1844
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:19,770
the consciousness was gone instantly.
He fell down like he was dead.

1845
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:23,940
Those kind of knockouts, man. How many
of those you got in your life? I mean,

1846
01:40:23,941 --> 01:40:25,440
do you have five?
Do you have a number?

1847
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:29,160
Like five and after that you'll never be
the same person. Is it one? Is it two?

1848
01:40:29,161 --> 01:40:32,460
Is it three? We really don't know
because it varies per person.

1849
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:33,930
Do you see these guys fade sometimes?
I mean,

1850
01:40:33,931 --> 01:40:36,280
you're in their weekend and week
out commentating as you have C's.

1851
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:39,990
Do you ever see that? You know that Terry
Adam Guy and you're like, wait a second,

1852
01:40:39,991 --> 01:40:42,990
he's not moving in the same way.
He used to no question about it.

1853
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:47,430
You could see it in their, their speech
patterns. Some guys, a lot of, you know,

1854
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:51,090
look, the underground is a mixed
martial arts forum that I frequent. Uh,

1855
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,440
mixed martial arts are com the best,
in my opinion,

1856
01:40:53,441 --> 01:40:56,820
the best mixed martial arts
website on the world. And uh,

1857
01:40:57,850 --> 01:41:02,440
shut up bitch. And one of, one
of the things, uh, have you been,

1858
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:05,050
haven't been to share it.
They're good to their old school.

1859
01:41:05,051 --> 01:41:07,750
It's a great website too. There's
just a few too many cons on the board.

1860
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:12,610
They're just a little better at
squashing. Cantinas I, although I here,

1861
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:15,100
I shouldn't say that cause I hear shirt
docs gotten a lot better about it.

1862
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:17,660
Anyway.
My point is like they're,

1863
01:41:17,661 --> 01:41:20,350
they're ruthless because they're hiding
behind an anonymous screen names,

1864
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:23,380
but sometimes they're accurate and every
now and then they'll put up a video and

1865
01:41:23,381 --> 01:41:26,350
said, is, does so-and-so
seem to have brain damage?

1866
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,870
And then you listen to when you're
like, wow, that guy is struggling.

1867
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:29,920
Like there's certain,

1868
01:41:29,921 --> 01:41:33,190
like there was a video with Paul
Williams recently where he was, um,

1869
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:33,771
you know Paul,

1870
01:41:33,771 --> 01:41:38,140
you'll Williams the boxer who got knocked
out by Sergio Martinez with vicious

1871
01:41:38,141 --> 01:41:40,990
one punch knockout.
And then he was in a motorcycle accident,

1872
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,040
which left him paralyzed
and they interviewed him
in the motorcycle and I was

1873
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:49,280
listening to his labored speech and I
was like, Ooh, that doesn't sound good.

1874
01:41:49,281 --> 01:41:52,480
So horrible man. Yeah, I met, I
would, while it didn't mean it,

1875
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,730
but I was right behind
Terry Adams or a Terry.

1876
01:41:54,731 --> 01:41:58,240
I'm Norris rather when he was
talking to a fan once and uh,

1877
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:00,580
I was a huge Terry Norris
fan when I was a kid.

1878
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:05,580
He was like one of my favorite boxers
and Terry Norris was a standing there

1879
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:09,040
talking to this dude and I
couldn't believe it was real.

1880
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:12,880
I thought he was hammered drunk
or something. I thought they only,

1881
01:42:12,881 --> 01:42:15,520
this cannot be real.
This cannot be how this guy talks now.

1882
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:20,640
And so I like inched over clothes and
listen to their conversation and oh my

1883
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:22,180
God,
it was so sad.

1884
01:42:22,181 --> 01:42:25,270
It was the saddest fucking thing to me
because being a big fan of this guy and

1885
01:42:25,271 --> 01:42:29,980
watching his fight so many times, he
was, you know, this really wild dude.

1886
01:42:29,981 --> 01:42:32,980
And he, he got knocked out a few
times and he was one of those guys.

1887
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:37,780
It was either, it was either he
would kill or be killed, you know,

1888
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,793
and uh,

1889
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,940
he got knocked out by some Badass dudes
like Julian Jackson knocked him out,

1890
01:42:42,941 --> 01:42:47,020
like fucking scary knockouts and to see
him when he was younger than me at the

1891
01:42:47,021 --> 01:42:47,620
time.

1892
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:51,880
And to see him slurring his words like
that scared the fucking shit out of me,

1893
01:42:51,881 --> 01:42:55,150
man. Just scare the shit out of me.
You've seen Meldrick Taylor lately.

1894
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:58,030
Have you seen that horrific,

1895
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,620
horrific Meldrick Taylor was one
of the best boxers, you know,

1896
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:03,490
to ever come out of the Olympics
and his early professional days,

1897
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:07,150
he was fucking wizard.
He was so fast and he had one really,

1898
01:43:07,151 --> 01:43:10,780
really brutal fight with Julio.
Cesar Chavez. Never the same again.

1899
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:13,210
And then Terry Norris knocked him out.
A few guys knocked him out,

1900
01:43:13,211 --> 01:43:14,140
but he's still fighting.

1901
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:17,950
And they had an interview
with him recently on Hbo
when they showed him when he

1902
01:43:17,951 --> 01:43:22,300
was younger talking and then they
showed him today. And it's horrendous.

1903
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:26,650
It's, it's, that is a real
reality of combat sports. Do you,

1904
01:43:26,651 --> 01:43:29,970
do you think the UFC is safe enough now
or do you think in 10 years we're going

1905
01:43:29,971 --> 01:43:33,130
to start seeing blow back? And is there
any way the other way around that, I mean,

1906
01:43:33,131 --> 01:43:36,490
humans want to see combat sports,
right? Well look, here's what safe.

1907
01:43:36,491 --> 01:43:39,130
You've got to get out before
you have irreparable damage.

1908
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:42,940
That's what safe guys have done it.
There's guys who have retired and they're,

1909
01:43:42,941 --> 01:43:47,650
they're fine and healthy. Look,
Marvin Hagler is apparently in great,

1910
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:51,070
great health and you know, he was a
great boxer but he never got knocked.

1911
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:52,490
It never got fucked up,
you know,

1912
01:43:52,491 --> 01:43:54,980
and Hagler new after the sugar ray
Leonard fight. All right, I'm done.

1913
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:59,240
Cause it never came back.
Rocky Marciano did the same thing,

1914
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:01,060
got out before he got really fucked up.

1915
01:44:01,061 --> 01:44:05,280
[inaudible] was fine in his later years
before he died in a plane crash. But you,

1916
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:08,330
you can figure out when,
but you have to be,

1917
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,360
you have to be really smart and
it's hard to do. And it's also,

1918
01:44:11,361 --> 01:44:15,530
you have to have something that excites
you. Like fighting does cause these guys,

1919
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:19,460
it's not like you can fight and all
sudden you can't fight anymore. It's,

1920
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:23,090
you can fight and you fight just a
little less good than you used to and it

1921
01:44:23,091 --> 01:44:24,710
fucks with your head and you're like,
you know what man,

1922
01:44:24,711 --> 01:44:26,030
I just need to change my training up.

1923
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:28,910
I need to incorporate some fucking
swimming or something. You know?

1924
01:44:28,911 --> 01:44:31,550
And you'll try to do that and then you
get knocked out again and you're like,

1925
01:44:31,551 --> 01:44:33,860
wow, I was winning that first
round until I got caught. You know?

1926
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:36,740
And then then like Jens Pulver is
still going, still going at it.

1927
01:44:36,741 --> 01:44:40,640
And you guys still good enough to stay
in the game but only just only just,

1928
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:45,290
and those, those knockouts,
those all become ticket wholes,

1929
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:48,380
wholes in your ticket to chunk where
your ticket gets punched over and over

1930
01:44:48,381 --> 01:44:50,450
again. And how many you got? Who knows?

1931
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:53,420
I mean Allister's has been stopped a
bunch of times, but you look at him now,

1932
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:56,750
he's better than ever. Overeem. Yeah.
Over Ian's been stopped. But Peter Arts,

1933
01:44:56,751 --> 01:44:58,840
Peter Hertz has been
stopped a gang of times.

1934
01:44:58,841 --> 01:45:02,120
Still beat semis felt two years
ago in the k one Grand Prix.

1935
01:45:02,121 --> 01:45:04,190
So it's like some guys,

1936
01:45:04,191 --> 01:45:08,150
they can get stopped a bunch of times
and still be okay and other guys not.

1937
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:11,030
And I don't have the drawer right at
the end of the day, no one can tell you,

1938
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,230
no one can tell.
You know,

1939
01:45:12,231 --> 01:45:15,840
some guys like Mark Hunt can take
a fucking ferocious shot, you know?

1940
01:45:15,841 --> 01:45:18,560
And then there's other guys who just,
they can't take that much punishment.

1941
01:45:18,561 --> 01:45:22,070
They're built differently. They,
they, for whatever it's worth,

1942
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:24,740
who knows what it is.
It was some person as a glass jaw,

1943
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:27,440
the other guy's got an iron draw.
How much of it is psychological?

1944
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:30,950
How much of it is physical? It's hard
to tell. It's a combination of both,

1945
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:35,360
I'm sure. But it, it's not a
safe sport. It's, uh, it's,

1946
01:45:35,361 --> 01:45:36,710
it's safe as we can make it,

1947
01:45:36,711 --> 01:45:39,470
but the fighters all realize that there's
a certain amount of risk involved.

1948
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:42,320
You're going to get injured,
you're going to get broken bones,

1949
01:45:42,321 --> 01:45:44,690
you're going to get torn ligaments
are going to get concussions.

1950
01:45:44,691 --> 01:45:47,840
You're going to have that in mixed
martial arts. There's no way around that.

1951
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:52,400
So in that sense, it's as safe as we
can make it, but it's a dangerous sport.

1952
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:56,660
So they have to think about that and
they have to train with that in mind and

1953
01:45:56,661 --> 01:46:00,640
they have to understand when it's time
to not do it anymore. Yeah, me off,

1954
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:04,190
someone says, oh, the ref shouldn't
have stopped the fight. It's like, man,

1955
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:07,250
always err on the side of caution
when it's someone's brain in jeopardy.

1956
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:09,920
You know what I mean?
Uh, I think some guys,

1957
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:14,090
you got to let them try to get at
like Frankie Edgar, perfect example.

1958
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:17,810
How do you stop that guys? Flights early.
When you see like that first round back,

1959
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:20,960
was it gray Maynard two fights in a row.
You see that and you go,

1960
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:25,100
how could you stop that guys fight is you
gotta you gotta look at the individual

1961
01:46:25,101 --> 01:46:27,570
and his ability to bounce back from
punishment and you gotta get up.

1962
01:46:27,610 --> 01:46:29,480
Gotta give him the opportunity to win.

1963
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,010
And Frankie's proven time and time again
that he can do that. So in that sense,

1964
01:46:34,011 --> 01:46:37,850
the referee has to be an expert in,
in fighters,

1965
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:40,790
particular styles and their
ability to endure punishment.

1966
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:43,670
It's not the best way to,
to compete.

1967
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:47,600
But with a guy like Frankie Edgar,
it's also one of his weapons,

1968
01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:52,020
one of his weapons is that he's incredible
shape and that he recovers quickly

1969
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,050
and you know,
he can wear a guy out because of that.

1970
01:46:55,080 --> 01:47:00,080
He can do drag a guy into
sub crazy fucking firefight
where you know he's got a

1971
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:03,630
thousand bullets and the other guy
might only have 400 so you know,

1972
01:47:03,631 --> 01:47:07,050
he might think, oh, I've got 400 bullets,
this guy's fucking dead. Meanwhile,

1973
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:09,580
he could keep going
man, and like, you know,

1974
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:13,170
the fourth round with gray Maynard
when he knocked him out and it's like,

1975
01:47:13,171 --> 01:47:14,880
God damn,
he's still going.

1976
01:47:15,150 --> 01:47:18,090
He's still going at the same clip he
was going in the first round and gray

1977
01:47:18,091 --> 01:47:21,030
couldn't manage that at that
point and his in his career.

1978
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:23,370
What's it like behind the scenes
at UFC? I mean, what, what would,

1979
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,870
what would we be surprised at?

1980
01:47:24,871 --> 01:47:27,450
Something you just notice all the time
when you're calling those fights in the

1981
01:47:27,451 --> 01:47:31,860
UFC. I don't know man. You know, it's,
it's, it's a weird job. It's a weird,

1982
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:35,340
it's a weird job. Even for me, it's
hard to believe that it is my job.

1983
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:37,650
Like whenever I do it,
it's hard to believe.

1984
01:47:37,651 --> 01:47:40,470
I put on the headphones and they talked
to me in the booth. I'm like, what's up?

1985
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:42,330
What's up? What's up? You're
ready to do this. Let's do this.

1986
01:47:42,510 --> 01:47:46,170
Goldie and I touched knuckles and the
first fight, we're going to start in five,

1987
01:47:46,171 --> 01:47:50,070
four tr charter, the music plays and
the lights go on. You're like, wow,

1988
01:47:50,071 --> 01:47:52,530
I guess this is my job.
It's not hard to imagine there.

1989
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:55,560
They're paying you to do that even
seem real. It doesn't seem real.

1990
01:47:55,710 --> 01:48:00,480
It doesn't seem that I'm the one
who's, who represents the, the,

1991
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:05,100
the, the techniques and I'm the one who
explains to people what to look for and

1992
01:48:05,101 --> 01:48:08,250
what's going on. It's, it's very
strange. So even while I'm doing it,

1993
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:11,460
I'm doing it to the best of my abilities.
And the best of my knowledge,

1994
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:13,500
it's still bizarre is fuck,

1995
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:16,530
I have a hard time believing it's
really happening while I'm doing it.

1996
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,590
I always tell people were like you
and Goldberg, like I'm the Goldberg.

1997
01:48:19,591 --> 01:48:22,320
Cause like I got a bunch of questions.
I gotta ask Hancock for example.

1998
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:25,200
And then Nick's kind of like the
play by play flow. He just like,

1999
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:28,590
if he's feeling something, he just asked
that question and then I'm like, okay,

2000
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,440
I gotta get to these things.
I got to say the fighter does this,

2001
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,570
it does this next week on Fox, you
can watch this show. Yeah, yeah.

2002
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:38,640
That's Goldberg's move. Yeah,
it's, it's a difficult job.

2003
01:48:38,641 --> 01:48:41,940
He doesn't get nearly as much credit as
he deserves. He's really good at that.

2004
01:48:41,941 --> 01:48:45,270
He's really smooth. People just get
upset that he's not a martial artist.

2005
01:48:45,271 --> 01:48:50,271
But the bottom line is you really have
to be an actual martial artist to do

2006
01:48:50,461 --> 01:48:53,820
martial arts commentary. There is
no way around it. You can't fake it.

2007
01:48:53,821 --> 01:48:58,821
You can't not know how to take someone's
back and explain how he's got to take

2008
01:48:58,891 --> 01:49:02,470
us back. You can't, if you see someone
who's doing something, you know what?

2009
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,940
I'll see someone occasionally, I'm like,
you can't let go of that under hook.

2010
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:07,440
I'm like, if this guy, let's
go with that under hook,

2011
01:49:07,441 --> 01:49:10,400
this motherfucker is going to
take us back. Like especially
a guy like honey, ya,

2012
01:49:10,401 --> 01:49:14,040
ya or someone is like a super high
level guy like honey. Yah, Yah.

2013
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:15,180
One of his recent fights,

2014
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:19,170
he got site control on this guy and as
soon as he reached back, I'm like, oh,

2015
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:23,010
he's going north south choke.
And I called it like several steps ahead.

2016
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:26,130
But with a god like honey, you can
see it like I know what he's gonna do.

2017
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:29,640
You can't let him wrap his arm around
your neck and you let him reach back with

2018
01:49:29,641 --> 01:49:30,390
that left arm.

2019
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:33,150
You might as well just go to sleep and
just take a nap cause he's gonna choke

2020
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:36,720
you. And that's step one
of a three step process.

2021
01:49:36,721 --> 01:49:39,240
You're not gonna be able to stop
because once he got step one,

2022
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:42,350
he's he's basis set and
you're done and you know you,

2023
01:49:42,351 --> 01:49:45,990
you got to know that there's no way
you can know that without doing that.

2024
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:48,670
Listen to the early or the
commentary in the early year of CS.

2025
01:49:48,671 --> 01:49:51,940
It's hysterical because these guys were
like boxing commentators and something

2026
01:49:51,941 --> 01:49:54,520
that they just had no idea.
Right. You got it. You got to,

2027
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:59,910
the hardest part to me is the ground
game because there's so much varied.

2028
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:03,300
There's a lot of variables
in standup for sure. There's,

2029
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:04,840
it's not that standup is easy,

2030
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:09,630
but there's infinite variables
on the ground and you have
to understand the, the,

2031
01:50:09,631 --> 01:50:13,060
the various different styles of
attacking different positions.

2032
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:15,610
Like everybody's got
there at like some guys,

2033
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:19,280
they'll go side control on a guy and
face towards the feet and they'll,

2034
01:50:19,281 --> 01:50:19,811
they'll be like,

2035
01:50:19,811 --> 01:50:22,300
guys will try to get a gun at twister
or tried to get someone's back.

2036
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:25,300
And then there's other guys that go judo
style and they're going to look for,

2037
01:50:25,301 --> 01:50:27,370
you know, the, the, the mounted crucifix.

2038
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:29,920
They're going to look to ground and pound
or they're going to look for a scarf

2039
01:50:29,921 --> 01:50:33,520
whole or some, some kind of
like mark home. Mark Coleman
did that to Dan Severen.

2040
01:50:33,521 --> 01:50:36,850
It was like when the first submissions
in the UFC heavyweight division,

2041
01:50:36,851 --> 01:50:40,900
when he won the title, you, you,
you, you have to see all those,

2042
01:50:40,901 --> 01:50:43,870
you have to understand those, you have
to have been strangled. You have to,

2043
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:46,870
you have to get somebody with it. You
have to fight it off. You have to.

2044
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:47,830
If you don't,

2045
01:50:47,950 --> 01:50:51,610
you're not going to be able to explain
to people what this guy's doing wrong or

2046
01:50:51,611 --> 01:50:55,330
what he needs to do or what. And that's
what makes it more exciting when,

2047
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,260
when a guy is doing,

2048
01:50:56,261 --> 01:50:59,470
like Jimmy Smith is really good at
it from Bella tour with Jimmy Smith,

2049
01:50:59,471 --> 01:51:01,490
if a guy's got someone's
back, he's like, he's got,

2050
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,750
he's got to defend with his right arm
while he's attacking with his leg,

2051
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:08,350
you know, he'll, he'll explain to
people and if you're a person who's a,

2052
01:51:08,351 --> 01:51:11,440
an amateur or someone who has
nothing to do with martial arts,

2053
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:14,770
you can watch it and fall on, oh, I
see what that guy's doing. He's right.

2054
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,470
He's going to choke that guy. Oh
yeah. Yeah. And the other guy,

2055
01:51:17,471 --> 01:51:20,230
he's saying he's got out,
got to get his leg Frey,

2056
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:21,670
otherwise it's going to
get you. Oh, I see. Yeah.

2057
01:51:21,671 --> 01:51:25,300
He's holding him with his legs and
it, it, it, it adds to the excitement.

2058
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:28,630
And that's,
you can't be a sports guy and do that.

2059
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,950
You have to be a martial
artist. And that note, Joe,

2060
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:32,320
what's your favorite submission?

2061
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:38,040
Chokes the color or no, no,
no, no, no, no. I hate that.

2062
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:41,120
I do. Yeah. I have a black
belt under John Jackson Hole,

2063
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,360
but I don't fucking use it.

2064
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:46,820
I use over hooks and under hooks.
I,

2065
01:51:46,830 --> 01:51:50,610
I believe that if your
game is gay oriented, the,

2066
01:51:50,611 --> 01:51:52,780
the good thing about the gies defense,

2067
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:57,160
the good thing about the Biggie is
you must be tactical in your defense.

2068
01:51:57,190 --> 01:52:00,280
You have to be tactical in your tax
can't because a guy gets a hold of your

2069
01:52:00,281 --> 01:52:01,840
collar or a guy gets
a hold of your sleeve.

2070
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:04,450
There's a lot of shit they could do
to you. We, if you were slippery,

2071
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:06,910
and with Nokia you can
just muscle out of it,

2072
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:10,660
but you have to use technique and you
have to do it the right way with a g.

2073
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:15,370
So in that way, looking at good, you're
like a doss and Bravo. But I think that,

2074
01:52:15,371 --> 01:52:17,440
um,
or rear nakeds and gay teens.

2075
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:20,830
But I think that the beautiful thing about
a g is if you're fighting a guy who's

2076
01:52:20,831 --> 01:52:21,664
got a coat on,

2077
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:24,970
you know some guys got a leather
jacket on who's talking shit like,

2078
01:52:25,110 --> 01:52:28,140
oh you have to do is grab his collar
and he's dead and what's happening?

2079
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,330
All you have to do is get a hand.
He won't even know what you're doing.

2080
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:33,960
He'll be trying to punch you and
you just reach into his college.

2081
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:36,030
You know what I find interesting,
I'm an,

2082
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,530
I don't know if you remember
there was that scientists,

2083
01:52:38,531 --> 01:52:42,640
there was a a group of islands that had
different monkey tribes on and what was

2084
01:52:42,641 --> 01:52:46,040
happening is when one monk in
one on and learn one, learn

2085
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,230
how to pick a certain Manana,
we'll open a certain fruit.

2086
01:52:48,231 --> 01:52:51,070
Then all the other monkeys learned it
and it's a similar thing with Jujitsu,

2087
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:54,950
like suddenly like you'll just see this
new choke in the game that you've never

2088
01:52:54,951 --> 01:52:57,650
seen before and then in three
months everyone knows it.

2089
01:52:57,651 --> 01:52:58,580
It's such an interesting thing.

2090
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:03,780
Darcy's came along now way that's made
me think of it kick that Anderson Silva

2091
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:07,130
Front kick after they started doing
everybody. Well that was so dramatic.

2092
01:53:07,131 --> 01:53:08,900
That was something that everybody saw.

2093
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:12,290
But what I think what you're saying
is that it's just like spreads through

2094
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:15,430
schools because people just figure it
out at the same time because they watched

2095
01:53:15,431 --> 01:53:19,520
you two photos
sometimes.

2096
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,170
Well there's also one technique,

2097
01:53:21,171 --> 01:53:24,740
like there'll be like a new technique
that like one of them was attacking from

2098
01:53:24,741 --> 01:53:25,371
the half guard.

2099
01:53:25,371 --> 01:53:28,070
One of the things that opened up the Darce
was at a lot of people were attacking

2100
01:53:28,071 --> 01:53:31,040
from the half guard and they were
going with a double underhooks attack.

2101
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:33,170
And when they're going with
a double under hooks attack,

2102
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:36,830
a lot of guys were sneaking their arms
in and then all of a sudden it became

2103
01:53:36,831 --> 01:53:39,230
Anaconda, chokes, Doris chokes. It became,

2104
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:42,710
that's what people were going for it
because you subset of God basically. Yeah.

2105
01:53:42,711 --> 01:53:46,550
And it was basically to, to deal with
under hooks that a guy, you know, if,

2106
01:53:46,551 --> 01:53:49,850
so if you're in a guys,
you're on the side of a guy,

2107
01:53:49,851 --> 01:53:53,660
like maybe in half guard and a guy's like
has a really strong under hook. If you,

2108
01:53:53,661 --> 01:53:57,530
you know that if you get your arm under
his under hook and passes neck and

2109
01:53:57,531 --> 01:54:00,140
connect your arms together,
now he's in a bit of trouble.

2110
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,240
You just put yourself in
a dangerous situation.

2111
01:54:02,241 --> 01:54:05,940
Like you're trying to be very offensive
budding, allowing me to wizard,

2112
01:54:05,941 --> 01:54:07,880
you're underhooking pass by your neck,

2113
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:11,150
now you've allowed me to control your
neck, now I've got a position on you.

2114
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:13,810
And now especially if
you go Japanese Necktie,

2115
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:16,100
which is one of the new moves that a
lot of guys are doing now and said,

2116
01:54:16,101 --> 01:54:18,200
I've never even heard of that and we're
got to show it to you as the shit.

2117
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:22,480
He's way more high.
It's way more percentage,

2118
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,890
way more high percentage than a,
than a Doris.

2119
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:28,010
Let me ask your question cause you control
the guy's head check question about

2120
01:54:28,011 --> 01:54:31,070
London and, and what you think of London.
Well, he, I think he was going to,

2121
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:33,950
I was cut him off on the
show. I'm always like, no,

2122
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:38,180
it's hard to do that right here. We have
an hour. You're rude to like, to like, uh,

2123
01:54:38,181 --> 01:54:40,550
you know, to cut people off, but
you know, you're not meaning to,

2124
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:43,310
it's just like you have a thought and
if you don't say come on down to the

2125
01:54:43,311 --> 01:54:47,410
scapes and it gets away from you.
Cause the conversation derivatives I have,

2126
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:51,470
I have, I have two dude. I'm sorry. I'll
never forgive myself. So the first one is,

2127
01:54:51,471 --> 01:54:52,130
um,

2128
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:54,800
do you think if you go to a time machine
and traveled a hundred years into the

2129
01:54:54,801 --> 01:54:57,650
future and then walk
into a Jujitsu Academy,

2130
01:54:57,651 --> 01:55:01,430
do you think you'd still be able to hang?
Like I'd get killed? Do you think so?

2131
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:04,440
I'm pretty sure. My interesting.
Yeah. Unless, unless a,

2132
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:08,470
they were fucking terrible like fuck
ups from white belts. Yeah, I guess so.

2133
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:13,010
But I think black belts, well, black
belts, they're really good black belts.

2134
01:55:13,011 --> 01:55:17,240
I'm not, you know, I'm a week black
belt, like objectively, like I'm strong,

2135
01:55:17,241 --> 01:55:19,640
don't get me wrong,
I'm a have strong Jujitsu.

2136
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:23,180
But as far as like high end black belt
guys, I used to get tapped, you know,

2137
01:55:23,181 --> 01:55:26,480
it's just, it's just reality. You
know, I'm not a world champion.

2138
01:55:26,481 --> 01:55:31,190
I remember the time to put into that too.
In order. I have much more potential.

2139
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:34,910
I mean, if I really had the time to train
five days a week and get a strength and

2140
01:55:34,911 --> 01:55:38,070
conditioning, I think I could
jump my game up big. I think my,

2141
01:55:38,071 --> 01:55:42,560
my mind is way more ahead of my body.
It's just, I don't have the time to do it.

2142
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:44,200
I don't know when it's
time to put in the numbers

2143
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,290
in between having a
family and doing standup,

2144
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:48,810
doing a podcast and traveling for the UFC,

2145
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:51,780
it's hard to try to train as much
as I can. And when I train, I do.

2146
01:55:51,781 --> 01:55:54,780
I give 100% but he's still
writing a book or, yeah. Yeah.

2147
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:58,320
I just got to do you feel like you need
to get a book out of, you know, um,

2148
01:55:58,420 --> 01:56:00,390
I would like to do it.
I have a,

2149
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:03,630
I have a lot of shit already written
and I will eventually put it out.

2150
01:56:03,631 --> 01:56:08,631
But right now I'm concentrating on
my new studio and my standup special,

2151
01:56:08,731 --> 01:56:11,550
which is going to be out at the end
of the month and the end of October.

2152
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:13,560
Is that already in the can? It's,
yeah, it's already in the can.

2153
01:56:13,561 --> 01:56:15,630
It's just a matter of the
website getting built, which is,

2154
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:18,330
it takes a lot longer than you
think to have a nice website made.

2155
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,880
So that's being made. And then, um,

2156
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:23,520
just to get the infrastructure
in place to share it. It, I,

2157
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:27,240
I found out somewhere along the line that
when I do too many things at the same

2158
01:56:27,241 --> 01:56:31,470
time, I don't have any fun
and joy. Everything suffers.
A family and everything.

2159
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,480
Yeah.
Well I won't let that suffer.

2160
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:36,780
So the things that suffer or
other aspects of my career,

2161
01:56:36,781 --> 01:56:38,370
so I limit the amount of shit that I do.

2162
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:42,120
So once this standup specials out
and I can not think about that, boom.

2163
01:56:42,121 --> 01:56:44,310
Then I'm diving full into writing.

2164
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:47,000
I'm writing the book
because I already have the,

2165
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:49,310
I have to balance it out
with writing standup,

2166
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:53,310
which right now is more important because
my special is about to drop and I have

2167
01:56:53,311 --> 01:56:56,700
a whole new hour that I've basically
put together between the time I did the

2168
01:56:56,701 --> 01:57:00,270
special and now what do you want from
your stand up like in five years from now?

2169
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:03,540
I mean do you want to see like bigger
audiences or do you ever have goals like

2170
01:57:03,541 --> 01:57:07,010
that? No, no. I'm, I'm super
happy with the way. If,

2171
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:10,170
if nothing changed at all then the
other than the way it is right now.

2172
01:57:10,171 --> 01:57:13,080
If it just maintained a,
I'd be the happiest person on earth.

2173
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:17,310
I have the greatest audiences in the
history of that. The the art form.

2174
01:57:17,311 --> 01:57:18,300
It's the craziest thing ever.

2175
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:22,080
I wish you guys could come to see some
of these crowds because they're crazy and

2176
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:23,790
it's mostly podcast fans.

2177
01:57:23,791 --> 01:57:27,570
It's mostly people who don't just
resonate with the idea of comedy,

2178
01:57:27,571 --> 01:57:31,530
but resonate with the idea that there's
someone out there that's also confused

2179
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:34,530
by all this and there's someone out
there that's being honest about all of it

2180
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:37,050
and those people. I've,
I've, I've sort of found a,

2181
01:57:37,051 --> 01:57:40,350
found a huge amount of them because
of this podcast and I don't,

2182
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:44,750
I don't desire anything more than that.
It's already the,

2183
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,220
just having all the people
come up to me after shows.

2184
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:50,010
All the people that tell me they've lost
weight and all the people that told me

2185
01:57:50,011 --> 01:57:51,420
they've got their shit together,
that they've,

2186
01:57:51,470 --> 01:57:54,310
they're living their life like
they're the hero in their own story.

2187
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:56,343
It's a great way,

2188
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:59,700
and it should be like the blockbuster
moment in the movie every day.

2189
01:58:00,530 --> 01:58:03,870
You should be saving the
girl. You shouldn't be that.
You could, you could be,

2190
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:07,080
you could literally do what the hero
would do, you know? And it doesn't mean,

2191
01:58:07,081 --> 01:58:10,090
you know, rescue babies had a burning
buildings. It means don't be a cunt.

2192
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:12,330
Figured out a way to get
your shit together. Don't,

2193
01:58:12,331 --> 01:58:16,170
don't be someone who's just slacking off
and jerking off while behind you is a

2194
01:58:16,171 --> 01:58:20,250
mountain of work to do, you know, get,
get, get your stuff done, do it. Do it.

2195
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:23,720
Do be someone who you admire.
And that's something that I,

2196
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:27,240
I had to learn on my own slowly
over a long period of time.

2197
01:58:27,241 --> 01:58:31,100
But in reiterating that on the podcast,
just like in teaching Jujitsu,

2198
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:34,260
it's become like very concrete in my head.
You know,

2199
01:58:34,270 --> 01:58:38,220
I'm have another very deep and meaningful
question of I want your input on it.

2200
01:58:38,221 --> 01:58:40,860
In fact, me and my Jujitsu buddies
debate about the solar, the time,

2201
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:44,350
and some of them want your,
your, your input, which is, um,

2202
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:48,460
what do you think would win in a fight
out of a silverback gorilla and a bangle?

2203
01:58:48,461 --> 01:58:51,410
Tiger, tiger, tiger themselves.
Show that gorilla. Come on man.

2204
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:57,480
See I say gorilla man. He can rip a car,
tire and half with his bare hands. Right?

2205
01:58:57,490 --> 01:59:01,650
That shit with that Tiger's got your
back and choking giant. I refuse.

2206
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:05,470
I don't think the tiger would fuck with
the gorilla because it's not going to be

2207
01:59:05,471 --> 01:59:08,920
easy. I think it's going to be a struggle.
That's why gorillas nest on the ground,

2208
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:10,690
you know,
gorillas don't give a fuck.

2209
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:14,690
They're there 500 pounds and they're
five foot four natural predators. They,

2210
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:18,050
they're so strong. I mean, we can't even
wrap our heads around how strongly are,

2211
01:59:18,250 --> 01:59:19,870
because chimps are strong as fuck.

2212
01:59:19,871 --> 01:59:23,140
And gorillas would rape a chimp with
their little one inch Dick. You know,

2213
01:59:23,141 --> 01:59:25,870
gorillas have tiny decks and know
that because they're so dominant,

2214
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:29,440
they don't have any pressure
from other males. And the women,

2215
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:33,310
the female gorillas are so in line
with how everything's supposed to be.

2216
01:59:33,311 --> 01:59:36,640
They're not sluts at all.
Female chimps are whores.

2217
01:59:36,820 --> 01:59:40,420
They will fuck anybody comes
around and mail chimp's know this.

2218
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:42,790
Some mail chimps have giant testicles.

2219
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:46,180
And the reason why they
have giant testicles is they
always gotta be ready to go

2220
01:59:46,181 --> 01:59:48,250
with a big fat load for
one of these dirty bitches.

2221
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:53,410
That's a part of the show that's
a part of the chimp world.

2222
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:56,530
All animals that live in
promiscuous societies, all,

2223
01:59:56,531 --> 01:59:59,170
they all have large testicles,
including human beings.

2224
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:02,800
There's a direct correlation between
the size of a man's testicles.

2225
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,640
And the promise cues.
You have the women in your environment.

2226
02:00:06,641 --> 02:00:08,080
When you going to Africa on Safari,

2227
02:00:08,081 --> 02:00:11,530
I know you always said you're scared
of Africa. This is a real safari dude.

2228
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,860
You Go Botswana. Yeah, but
you know when you go dude,

2229
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:18,320
you go to these wildlife
sort of containment areas
where you know everybody gets

2230
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:22,170
in Africa,
you can go to propose Botswana,

2231
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:24,120
you can go by line.

2232
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:29,110
There was a whole fucking story recently
about a these two female lions that

2233
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:33,460
broke into a house and pulled a guy
out of the shower. He was showering,

2234
02:00:33,610 --> 02:00:37,570
he was naked, showering and he got
killed by two female. Let's do all that.

2235
02:00:37,571 --> 02:00:39,370
They do all the hunting and nails.
Just sit around.

2236
02:00:39,610 --> 02:00:42,920
Could you wrap your head around
it so you're not trying to Africa.

2237
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:47,800
So He da,
he da and you hear something.

2238
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:52,120
You open the fucking curtain. There's
two lions in the bathroom with you,

2239
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:55,780
two female lions and they just
put the beaten on you, sign,

2240
02:00:55,960 --> 02:01:00,740
rip you to shreds and drag you out.
Okay, what's the best way to go? Africa.

2241
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:04,990
Africa can suck my Dick.
Okay.

2242
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:09,900
I'm not going to wear all
the scary animals live bears.

2243
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:13,530
So Joe, if you have to choose a way to
die, like would you rather be in the,

2244
02:01:13,531 --> 02:01:18,160
in the water with a great white
or no, you're not going to want,

2245
02:01:18,161 --> 02:01:19,780
if me into a fucking heart attack.

2246
02:01:21,450 --> 02:01:26,110
I'm fucking scared of all
of them, man. I'm scared of
tigers. I'm scared of sharks.

2247
02:01:26,111 --> 02:01:29,740
I'm scared of everything dude. Sound
scared of all that shit, Joe, by the way,

2248
02:01:29,741 --> 02:01:33,870
that the ancient alien documentary,
amazing thing that you tweeted talk.

2249
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:37,630
Did you watch the whole thing? I watched,
I watched all three hours. Yeah, I should.

2250
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:40,950
I should give that guy
props. Um, there's a,

2251
02:01:40,951 --> 02:01:43,460
a video that I tweeted yesterday,

2252
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:48,140
today is October the second
and if you go to the October,

2253
02:01:48,141 --> 02:01:52,730
the first feed,
I tweeted this video where this guy,

2254
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:57,731
he must have like massive autism because
this guy went and debunked every single

2255
02:01:59,271 --> 02:02:04,271
point that ancient aliens has ever put
forth about how humans could have never

2256
02:02:05,391 --> 02:02:07,580
built this.
This is impossible.

2257
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:12,850
He fucking stomped a dirty mud hole in
every fucking show that they've ever

2258
02:02:14,031 --> 02:02:17,360
done. And he did it. It's
over three hours long.

2259
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:21,720
It's on youtube and there's no question,
no question, no question. And you're like,

2260
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:24,320
okay, yeah, it's so good. It said,

2261
02:02:24,321 --> 02:02:29,321
just go to ancient aliens debunked
and you want full movie fixed audio.

2262
02:02:29,841 --> 02:02:32,330
That's the version. The other one had
a little weird glitch in the audio,

2263
02:02:32,331 --> 02:02:35,720
but it's still, it's still, you can
still watch it. It's still excellent.

2264
02:02:35,990 --> 02:02:39,350
And it's called the guy's
youtube name is what does it,

2265
02:02:39,351 --> 02:02:43,490
verse by verse bt.
That's it.

2266
02:02:43,491 --> 02:02:46,910
It's one word verse by verse bt that his,
his uh,

2267
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:50,390
his youtube page and it's a brilliant job.
Whoever this guy is,

2268
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:51,620
thank you very much.

2269
02:02:51,621 --> 02:02:56,621
Because what you did is you cleared up
so much confusion and for me there was a

2270
02:02:56,991 --> 02:02:58,730
lot of stuff that I
really didn't understand.

2271
02:02:58,731 --> 02:03:01,160
There's still some stuff that
hasn't been explained. There's a,

2272
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:04,460
some of the things about Puma
Puma coup and the way they, uh,

2273
02:03:04,461 --> 02:03:06,650
they move stones and fit them in.

2274
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:10,580
I think it's very
interesting that you know,

2275
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:15,610
that this guy was able to find so many
pieces of evidence that point to how they

2276
02:03:15,831 --> 02:03:20,810
did certain things and explain how they
built obelisks and giant stones and,

2277
02:03:20,811 --> 02:03:24,710
and show ones that were in the process
of being made when they abandoned.

2278
02:03:24,710 --> 02:03:27,620
So you can clearly see how they did it.
Fascinating.

2279
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:31,820
And also yet some brilliant insight on
the construction of the pyramids that I

2280
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:36,140
had never heard before about the
theory of the internal ramp because the

2281
02:03:36,141 --> 02:03:39,290
question has always been like how they,
how they placed the stones,

2282
02:03:39,291 --> 02:03:44,140
how did they move them into place? And
uh, they actually did some sort of a, um,

2283
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:47,390
uh, like an x ray of the, uh,

2284
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:52,510
with some radio wave graph of the pyramid
and you can actually see the internal

2285
02:03:53,151 --> 02:03:57,500
ramp and they didn't understand what
that was when they first made this, uh,

2286
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:58,730
this reading of the,

2287
02:03:58,731 --> 02:04:03,731
the actual structure of the pyramid of
Giza until this internal ramp theory came

2288
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:04,610
into play.

2289
02:04:04,610 --> 02:04:08,300
And this guy examines the internal ramp
theory and shows all the evidence for it,

2290
02:04:08,420 --> 02:04:13,420
including areas of the pyramid where at
certain points you could actually go in

2291
02:04:14,001 --> 02:04:15,260
through the side of the pyramid,

2292
02:04:15,261 --> 02:04:18,560
there's a hole and you can go in and see
where there's all this space in there

2293
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:21,770
and most likely that's how it was built.
What does Graham Hancock saying?

2294
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:26,590
That's what I want to know. Either way
this, listen, listen, this, this, um,

2295
02:04:26,750 --> 02:04:29,270
ancient aliens debunking.

2296
02:04:29,390 --> 02:04:33,890
What it does is explain how all
these things were done. Would,

2297
02:04:33,891 --> 02:04:36,560
it doesn't explain is how
they figured this out. Would,

2298
02:04:36,561 --> 02:04:39,960
it doesn't explain is what kind of
intense mathematics were involved in the

2299
02:04:39,961 --> 02:04:43,920
equations of 2 million,
300,000 stones each.

2300
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:48,960
What each of them cut so perfectly that
they meet exactly in a point at the top.

2301
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:53,220
It's amazing. I mean when it doesn't
explain why they did these things,

2302
02:04:53,221 --> 02:04:55,890
it doesn't explain that and it doesn't
explain where they got the knowledge from.

2303
02:04:55,891 --> 02:04:59,850
It explains how they did it and how
they did it was, it was certainly,

2304
02:04:59,851 --> 02:05:01,050
it took a long time.

2305
02:05:01,051 --> 02:05:05,820
It certainly was incredibly difficult
and certainly required master craftsmen

2306
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:08,430
and builders and skillful labor.

2307
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:11,100
But the knowledge to construct it is,

2308
02:05:11,330 --> 02:05:16,110
which really fascinating because that
is what Graham Hancock points to is that

2309
02:05:16,111 --> 02:05:21,111
is not that he doesn't believe that this
was a like aliens came down and gave

2310
02:05:21,601 --> 02:05:23,880
people information like
the ancient aliens guys do.

2311
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:27,960
What he believes is what's
bad backed by real evidence.

2312
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:32,850
And that evidence is that there was a
very sophisticated culture that existed

2313
02:05:32,851 --> 02:05:36,840
all over the world,
somewhere around 10,000 BC.

2314
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:40,440
And that's something probably
happened to those people.

2315
02:05:40,441 --> 02:05:43,320
And we had to start a
lot of things over again.

2316
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:48,300
And coincidentally this time period
that Graham Hancock points too,

2317
02:05:48,301 --> 02:05:50,490
which is about 10,000 plus BC,

2318
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:55,850
is the exact same time period that the
most recent discoveries of glass impact

2319
02:05:56,491 --> 02:06:01,491
glass from meteor showers
has been discovered at the
same layer of dirt all over

2320
02:06:02,371 --> 02:06:06,510
the world.
So scientists are absolutely convinced,

2321
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:08,010
and this is fairly recently,

2322
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:13,310
that there was incredibly destructive
meteor showers around 12,000 years ago and

2323
02:06:14,491 --> 02:06:16,050
they found these in France.

2324
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:19,200
They found this glass in the Middle
East and when they do soil samples,

2325
02:06:19,201 --> 02:06:22,380
it's all on the same,
I believe it's called the same Strada.

2326
02:06:22,381 --> 02:06:26,250
I think that's how they describe it.
The same area where they know, you know,

2327
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:29,370
they're the way to do the calculation
stuff, how, how old it is.

2328
02:06:29,371 --> 02:06:33,750
And when they do a carbon testing on
that area and they believe that somewhere

2329
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:38,490
12,000 years ago, that's when the
ending the, and the ice age ended.

2330
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:41,760
That's when all this mass extinction,

2331
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:45,420
it's all around the same time of
woolly mammoths and Saber Tooth Tigers.

2332
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:47,590
It's all on the same sort of area.
Um,

2333
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:50,970
and they could all be
v could all coincide.

2334
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:56,150
So what we have in ancient Egypt is not
simply an amazing culture that in 2,500

2335
02:06:57,481 --> 02:06:58,710
BC built the pyramids.

2336
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:03,920
It might very well be that 10,000 BC
they built the Sphinx and 10,000 BC,

2337
02:07:04,681 --> 02:07:07,830
they had massive stone
structures already in place.

2338
02:07:07,831 --> 02:07:11,070
Back when we thought that people were
just hunter gatherers. That's this,

2339
02:07:11,071 --> 02:07:14,070
that's the basis of Graham
Hancock's thoughts on it.

2340
02:07:14,071 --> 02:07:16,500
And every day he's being proven correct.

2341
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:20,280
The more people discover
about ancient civilizations,

2342
02:07:20,281 --> 02:07:25,070
the more Graham Hancock is
correct. We have a, sure we
were an all of the amazing,

2343
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:31,320
just a lovely human being to just a great
guy, you know, just exudes it, you know,

2344
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:36,040
he's like the perfect representative in
my opinion of what can be accomplished

2345
02:07:36,041 --> 02:07:40,090
through psychedelics and
thinking and, and, and just his,

2346
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:45,100
his take on his own work and his
take on, you know, the, the, the,

2347
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:49,570
the difficulty in trying to express
these very controversial ideas.

2348
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:53,200
It's amazing to be honest, I don't know
if you've watched the show with us,

2349
02:07:53,201 --> 02:07:57,610
but he talked about the 24 years that he
was smoke cannabis and how the Iowasca

2350
02:07:57,611 --> 02:08:01,990
told him and he just dropped that right
on us and the episode and just like, man,

2351
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:05,350
I have a lot of respect for someone who
can just be that honest about themselves.

2352
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:08,170
That's the kind of guy you want
running your country men. I just, yeah,

2353
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:11,600
he's no longer a writer or
an archeologist. He was like
a, it was a great match.

2354
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:16,620
Mine is a great man and he changed
the way I looked at history.

2355
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:20,560
That book fingerprints of the Gods
changed the way I look at history and I'm

2356
02:08:20,561 --> 02:08:21,371
pretty convinced now,

2357
02:08:21,371 --> 02:08:24,940
especially due to the most recent
geological evidence and to discoveries of

2358
02:08:24,941 --> 02:08:26,770
things like to go Beckley Tempe,

2359
02:08:27,070 --> 02:08:32,070
which is this 14,000 year old massive
compound of huge nine foot tall stone

2360
02:08:33,161 --> 02:08:35,230
columns.
This is really an excuse.

2361
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:38,850
It's a 19 I think it might be
19 foot tall stone columns,

2362
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:44,470
but what it is still amazing
because 14,000 years ago
people were supposed to be

2363
02:08:44,471 --> 02:08:47,560
hunter gathering. It wasn't supposed to
be any sort of civilization like this.

2364
02:08:47,561 --> 02:08:50,740
We're supposed to live in fucking
teepees and Shit, you know?

2365
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:55,270
Then he's showing that there's these
huge stone structures by the way,

2366
02:08:55,271 --> 02:08:58,900
which they've only uncovered
less than 4% of I believe,

2367
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:03,280
because it's a painstaking process of
uncovering because you know they've got to

2368
02:09:03,281 --> 02:09:04,690
do it with toothbrushes and shit.

2369
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:08,350
They've got a sift through the sand
and find bone fragments and pottery

2370
02:09:08,351 --> 02:09:10,690
fragments and things along those lines.

2371
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:15,840
But what they do know about gold Beckley
Tempe is that it was covered up 14,000

2372
02:09:16,151 --> 02:09:19,060
years ago. Covered up,
purposely covered up.

2373
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:22,780
They literally buried
a whole fucking city,

2374
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:27,130
14,000 originally made intentionally.
They did intentionally.

2375
02:09:27,131 --> 02:09:30,430
They know they did because the
type of landfill that they use,

2376
02:09:30,431 --> 02:09:35,110
the type they used a type of, they filled
in the area. They're convinced of this.

2377
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:37,990
They've, you know, I don't know
how they can figure that out,

2378
02:09:37,991 --> 02:09:40,270
but they were pretty much in
agreement go to those sites. I mean,

2379
02:09:40,271 --> 02:09:43,580
you don't want to go to the pyramids.
And Chuck been to teaching Eatsa.

2380
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:47,420
That's the only place I've ever been
to South America. Mexico, Mexico. Yeah.

2381
02:09:47,421 --> 02:09:51,760
It's near Cancun. Fucking amazing
man. It's amazing. It's incredible.

2382
02:09:52,180 --> 02:09:53,680
It's feels,
feels different when you're there.

2383
02:09:53,681 --> 02:09:56,680
You can feel there's something
about it Reiki beyond freaky.

2384
02:09:56,920 --> 02:10:00,280
Just to think that you're walking in
this area. And as I'm looking around,

2385
02:10:00,281 --> 02:10:02,400
I remember she was standing there,
um,

2386
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:05,890
and just thinking that at one
point in time this was like,

2387
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:09,940
this was a football field and they were
playing that crazy game where they kick

2388
02:10:09,941 --> 02:10:12,900
this ball through a hole which devolve to,
uh,

2389
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:15,610
they believe that they might have played
it with human heads at one point in

2390
02:10:15,611 --> 02:10:18,890
time. And just the one
area where they have, uh,

2391
02:10:18,940 --> 02:10:23,290
the sacrificial altar where they would
kill someone and cut their heart out and

2392
02:10:23,291 --> 02:10:26,590
throw the heart down the stairs. I
mean, they had it, you could go there,

2393
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:31,030
you could touch that altar,
you could walk up this stone staircase.

2394
02:10:31,090 --> 02:10:34,280
There's a few really negative when
you're like, feels, it's like they,

2395
02:10:34,281 --> 02:10:35,990
these guys went dark.

2396
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:40,070
Hancock's new book is about as new
fictional pieces about that whole period.

2397
02:10:40,071 --> 02:10:43,080
And he said, oh my gosh,
she's talked about it on the
show. And we were like, yeah,

2398
02:10:43,081 --> 02:10:46,610
it talks about 80,000 people being
slaughtered in four days for ceremonial

2399
02:10:46,611 --> 02:10:51,240
purposes. And he was, I was just
like, Oh God. I was terrified.

2400
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:55,100
He was actually at paypal, they
slaughtered in four days. And he said,

2401
02:10:55,101 --> 02:10:58,010
just the rivers of blood and
that the human sacrifice,

2402
02:10:58,011 --> 02:11:01,670
I guess they would fatten people up in
pens for days and weeks on end in order

2403
02:11:01,671 --> 02:11:06,080
to sacrifice for like a brand new monument
and just the concept of you being,

2404
02:11:06,081 --> 02:11:08,960
they're fattened up with your family
when you know you're just going to be,

2405
02:11:08,961 --> 02:11:12,590
have just db used to have your heart
pulled out of your body and the shown and

2406
02:11:12,591 --> 02:11:15,440
then human beings are capable
of some fucked up shit.

2407
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:19,700
And the crazy thing is it's like how
did they go from the people that were so

2408
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:24,730
incredibly sophisticated that they built
these structures that were aligned to

2409
02:11:24,831 --> 02:11:29,000
the cosmos and when they were
aligned to the directly correlate,

2410
02:11:29,001 --> 02:11:31,070
a lot of them do with constellations.

2411
02:11:31,071 --> 02:11:33,680
Like they understood the
alignment of certain stars.

2412
02:11:33,681 --> 02:11:37,970
They understood the prediction of lunar
eclipses like a thousand years in the

2413
02:11:37,971 --> 02:11:39,050
future.
They had figured out.

2414
02:11:39,170 --> 02:11:42,000
So they had this incredible
knowledge of astronomy and they,

2415
02:11:42,130 --> 02:11:46,100
they had figured out and recorded a
lot of like really incredible shit.

2416
02:11:46,430 --> 02:11:50,670
And yet they were killing 80,000 fucking
people and a couple of days and light

2417
02:11:50,671 --> 02:11:54,040
and dark boys go together. Right.
Is that what it is? I mean is,

2418
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:58,940
I feel like it's, I, I've been talking
about this lately on stage too,

2419
02:11:58,941 --> 02:12:01,910
about the real problem with the nuclear
bombs at the guy who pressed the button,

2420
02:12:01,911 --> 02:12:05,840
never didn't build it, doesn't
understand it, didn't create it,

2421
02:12:05,841 --> 02:12:10,130
didn't invent nuclear explosions,
didn't figure out how to split the atom,

2422
02:12:10,310 --> 02:12:12,110
didn't construct the whole piece.
He does it.

2423
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:15,440
He's come along and presses this button,

2424
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:18,620
almost Oppenheimer who worked on them
and it hadn't project in New Mexico.

2425
02:12:18,621 --> 02:12:22,500
He was, had big moral dilemmas about
creating the atom bomb. I mean,

2426
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:25,010
and he later died from cancer,
I think it was from throat cancer,

2427
02:12:25,011 --> 02:12:27,860
from being radio acted
when he was working on it.

2428
02:12:27,861 --> 02:12:30,320
But he was really troubled his whole life.
Yeah.

2429
02:12:30,430 --> 02:12:31,600
Well do you remember what he said?

2430
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:35,030
He said when they tested
the first nuclear bomb,

2431
02:12:35,031 --> 02:12:39,770
the very first explosion he quoted
the Bhagavad Gita said, I am,

2432
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:44,600
I am become death destroyer of worlds.
So he said like at the first,

2433
02:12:44,601 --> 02:12:47,600
cause he knew what he had
done. He's like, Oh shit,

2434
02:12:47,620 --> 02:12:48,990
he's got up some since calm one.

2435
02:12:49,010 --> 02:12:52,610
Could it just slacked off for probably
a few nights of work and not created it?

2436
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:53,810
Well,
see the thing who,

2437
02:12:53,811 --> 02:12:57,890
the people who can create it would
not be the people who created it.

2438
02:12:58,130 --> 02:13:01,850
The people who can create it with a
few people that go, you know, if you,

2439
02:13:01,851 --> 02:13:04,490
if you just understand how atoms work,

2440
02:13:04,491 --> 02:13:07,340
if you've got in there and split this
and did this and that, you could do,

2441
02:13:07,470 --> 02:13:08,990
you shouldn't do it,
but if you did,

2442
02:13:09,110 --> 02:13:11,770
well you could do is to puck and have
the incredible destructive power.

2443
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:14,570
Don't do it. But if you wanted to
do it, that's what you would do.

2444
02:13:14,670 --> 02:13:17,420
It's like the warrior or the the general,

2445
02:13:17,421 --> 02:13:22,421
the military man who would drop a fucking
atomic bomb on a building on a city is

2446
02:13:24,591 --> 02:13:27,680
way too fucking stupid to ever
figure out how to make that thing.

2447
02:13:27,890 --> 02:13:31,980
It's like the mentality to figure out
how to make an atomic is completely

2448
02:13:31,981 --> 02:13:35,610
different than the fatality that you would
just drop one out of a plane that's a

2449
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:37,530
different job.
If he had a nuclear bomb,

2450
02:13:37,531 --> 02:13:40,590
would would launch it on Israel or do
you think even augmented, God knows,

2451
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:44,070
I don't want to be the guy that
does this disruptive. I think.

2452
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:49,340
I think that when you have nuclear power
or any sort of mass destructive power,

2453
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:53,160
it's a lot like the military
equivalent of winning the lottery.

2454
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,880
You didn't really earn that.
You just have it.

2455
02:13:57,390 --> 02:14:00,180
You just have it and you're
going to spend it and you,

2456
02:14:00,181 --> 02:14:02,310
you're going to spend it with no regard.

2457
02:14:02,311 --> 02:14:06,000
You're going to spend it and not knowing
the consequences. You're, you're,

2458
02:14:06,001 --> 02:14:10,890
you're a child with a grownup toy.
You, you haven't developed this thing.

2459
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:14,220
You've just,
you've just got access to it the same way.

2460
02:14:14,221 --> 02:14:18,570
Some asshole who doesn't really understand
cars can somehow or another just go

2461
02:14:18,571 --> 02:14:23,571
into a Chevy dealership and buy a corvette
Zr one with 648 horsepower and just

2462
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:26,820
fucking stomp on it and
slam it right into a tree.

2463
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:31,940
That moron should have never had access
to that kind of power or never have

2464
02:14:32,311 --> 02:14:36,660
access to that kind of ability to move
so quickly with his own decision making.

2465
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:39,990
He can decide whether or not to run the
red lights and whether or not to just

2466
02:14:39,991 --> 02:14:44,710
drive his car right into a fucking mall
parking lot and smash into cars. You can,

2467
02:14:44,790 --> 02:14:47,970
you can do anything you want when
you have a a corvette, you die.

2468
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:51,690
But if you could choose to just drive
into traffic if you're fucking crazy.

2469
02:14:51,930 --> 02:14:56,730
There's something weird
about our ability in,

2470
02:14:56,731 --> 02:15:01,260
in contrast to what we
understand or what we've earned,

2471
02:15:01,261 --> 02:15:04,560
the power that we've earned. Like
if you build a bow and Arrow, okay,

2472
02:15:04,561 --> 02:15:07,870
if you're a tribesmen, you're out there
in the woods, you build a bone hour,

2473
02:15:07,890 --> 02:15:12,890
you craft it and you develop your aim
and then you use it and you hunt and kill

2474
02:15:13,651 --> 02:15:17,790
an animal. I mean, that is, that's
fair trade. I mean, you've really like,

2475
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:21,810
you've earned all of those steps.
You've vasculature and all of those,

2476
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:26,850
but if you drop a nuclear bomb in a
lake and then start pulling out fish,

2477
02:15:26,851 --> 02:15:28,580
we've got all the fish we need.
You know,

2478
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:32,150
you're just some fucking asshole
when the nuclear bomb like you, you,

2479
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:36,480
you can't build one of those on your own.
On a similar note, like that's why, um,

2480
02:15:36,790 --> 02:15:39,780
I've been told the best, the best,
uh, war leaders are the best.

2481
02:15:39,781 --> 02:15:42,420
Generals are the ones who've come up
through the ranks because they've seen

2482
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:46,020
combat. They know what it means
to send people onto a battlefield.

2483
02:15:46,290 --> 02:15:49,560
Where's the guy who just went to west
point and never fired a shot in his life?

2484
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,030
It's easy for him to say like,

2485
02:15:51,031 --> 02:15:54,510
send in the troops because he doesn't
know the direct consequences of that.

2486
02:15:54,511 --> 02:15:54,930
Right.

2487
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:59,610
I think that's one of the reasons why
they like people that get into office that

2488
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:04,340
aren't like Wesley Clark or like
John Mccain, people that, that,

2489
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:07,590
you know, essentially their chicken
hawks, guys like George Bush,

2490
02:16:07,591 --> 02:16:10,250
guys like Dick Cheney,
the ones who are the biggest warmongers.

2491
02:16:10,251 --> 02:16:12,550
So the ones who never experienced
it personally, you know,

2492
02:16:12,660 --> 02:16:16,410
I think a guy like John Mccain would
be far more reluctant to use a military

2493
02:16:16,411 --> 02:16:18,980
strategy knowing that there's
boys out there that it could,

2494
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:21,150
it could have been just like him,
you know,

2495
02:16:21,151 --> 02:16:26,151
a guy like a guy like Wesley Clark was
Cerner certainly be far more reluctant to

2496
02:16:28,050 --> 02:16:30,070
take, uh, you

2497
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:30,251
know,

2498
02:16:30,251 --> 02:16:33,760
the lives of these young soldiers for
granted because at one point in time that

2499
02:16:33,761 --> 02:16:34,180
was him.

2500
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:37,300
Colin Powell was really good about that
in the first Iraqi invasion because he

2501
02:16:37,301 --> 02:16:40,870
had spent so long in Vietnam and he'd
seen the mission creep there and like have

2502
02:16:40,871 --> 02:16:44,170
it lasted forever and ever and
he was really adamant. It's just,

2503
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:46,630
let's go in and get the hell
out. What's mission creep, Brian?

2504
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:51,100
It's when you don't have a defined, uh,
outcome of a mission, you were not like,

2505
02:16:51,101 --> 02:16:52,720
we're going to go in and do x, y, and zed.

2506
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:55,930
We're going to go in and wait until
there's peace or we're going to defeat

2507
02:16:55,931 --> 02:17:00,660
terrorism. And it's like there's no,
there's no specific, uh, and to that,

2508
02:17:00,670 --> 02:17:04,600
to that mission that's
happening in Afghanistan, it's
happened in Iraq and yeah.

2509
02:17:04,630 --> 02:17:07,270
Yeah. That's the idea that
we're slowly and, you know,

2510
02:17:07,271 --> 02:17:09,850
empowering our basis out
there and building up.

2511
02:17:09,850 --> 02:17:12,250
And that's what we're doing
right now with Iran. You know,

2512
02:17:12,650 --> 02:17:16,240
what we're doing with Iran, those are
slowly moving battleships into that area.

2513
02:17:16,241 --> 02:17:19,300
And you know, it's, it's getting pretty
scary events. A crazy unique case.

2514
02:17:19,301 --> 02:17:22,900
There's a website I want you to check out
some time called strapped for.com STI,

2515
02:17:22,930 --> 02:17:26,380
e t, f, O, r. And they're really big
into this thing called geopolitics,

2516
02:17:26,381 --> 02:17:29,560
which is basically every nation is built
on kind of their geography as well.

2517
02:17:29,561 --> 02:17:32,920
And they just talk about how it racks
built up in a very mountainous way.

2518
02:17:32,921 --> 02:17:35,620
And it's in no one's interest to go in
there cause it's such a mess to do that.

2519
02:17:35,621 --> 02:17:39,520
And I hope we don't anyways cause we
don't really have any business doing that.

2520
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:42,340
Uh, no. Sorry. Ran. Yeah, of course
I ran. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy.

2521
02:17:42,341 --> 02:17:44,290
We don't have business doing it.
It's nuts.

2522
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:48,040
They certainly shouldn't develop nuclear
arms. Who knows if they even are,

2523
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:51,960
who knows what they're even, they
even are trying, you know, it, it, I,

2524
02:17:51,970 --> 02:17:55,000
I assume they probably are,
but it could be propaganda.

2525
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:58,930
It could be just one of those things
where we just need that, that area,

2526
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:02,620
that path to bring our oil
through. You know? And that's what,

2527
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:06,610
that's what supposedly what this
whole fucking thing is about.

2528
02:18:06,611 --> 02:18:07,540
And it's a great Trump card.

2529
02:18:07,541 --> 02:18:11,290
I mean North Korea has used this threat
of a nuclear device to keep them alive

2530
02:18:11,291 --> 02:18:13,480
for like 20 years and they
keep bargaining. They're like,

2531
02:18:13,481 --> 02:18:15,100
we're going to bargain this month.
And then they don't.

2532
02:18:15,310 --> 02:18:18,060
And but it's kept him kind of
relevant just having this one weapon.

2533
02:18:18,061 --> 02:18:20,530
So I think that's why countries want it.
The whole world's a mess.

2534
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:25,390
I mean it's a bit frustrating
and we've more podcasts.

2535
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:29,140
Yeah, well believe it or not, that
sounds stupid, right? Like boy,

2536
02:18:29,141 --> 02:18:31,270
how grandiose are way we think
we're going to change the world.

2537
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:35,470
The only way you can change the world
is to influence young people so that the

2538
02:18:35,471 --> 02:18:36,790
young people go through the ranks,

2539
02:18:36,791 --> 02:18:40,630
don't imitate all the crusty old fuck
heads that had been running things and

2540
02:18:40,631 --> 02:18:44,080
these archaic ways because that's just
the way things always were done and

2541
02:18:44,081 --> 02:18:48,200
communication is super
important. Communication and
access to information. It was,

2542
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:49,480
this is a different world.

2543
02:18:49,510 --> 02:18:51,880
This is not a world where you can
bullshit people quite as easily.

2544
02:18:51,881 --> 02:18:55,150
Like if your idea is we're going to the
Iranian public and they listen to your

2545
02:18:55,151 --> 02:18:59,290
podcast and similarly maybe if there was
a crazy uranium podcasts and we could

2546
02:18:59,291 --> 02:19:00,160
listen to their leaders,

2547
02:19:00,161 --> 02:19:03,790
I just think communicating would get us
at least in the right direction. Well,

2548
02:19:03,791 --> 02:19:07,570
I bet my podcast does reach a lot of
our rains and I bet there's a lot of

2549
02:19:07,571 --> 02:19:10,840
Iranians who have their own podcast
just like London Real, you know?

2550
02:19:10,841 --> 02:19:15,310
I think I got to assume that,
that this is not going to stop here.

2551
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:19,720
This well. I think what's going
on with podcasts and with,

2552
02:19:19,721 --> 02:19:20,680
especially with the,

2553
02:19:20,681 --> 02:19:24,970
just the free ability to distribute
information and to communicate,

2554
02:19:25,210 --> 02:19:28,040
not even distribute information,
but just even a talk on

2555
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:31,730
the Internet to discuss things,
to do review things.

2556
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:33,950
It's never existed like this before.

2557
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:37,730
There's never been a time in human history
where a guy could be doing something

2558
02:19:37,731 --> 02:19:42,350
like my podcast in La and you guys in
London could be listening to it when

2559
02:19:42,351 --> 02:19:43,610
you're going jogging.
I mean with her,

2560
02:19:43,620 --> 02:19:48,360
where the fuck is that better part emails
from people in Denmark then we Taiwan

2561
02:19:48,790 --> 02:19:52,220
to, yeah, and it's five years ago
we could have done that. It's cheap.

2562
02:19:52,310 --> 02:19:53,121
It's not hard to do.

2563
02:19:53,121 --> 02:19:56,630
It's not like we had to spend billions
of dollars and put satellites in orbit

2564
02:19:56,631 --> 02:19:58,190
and figured out how to,
you know,

2565
02:19:58,191 --> 02:20:02,020
figure out how to get our
message to people and goes
over on a fucking horseback

2566
02:20:02,030 --> 02:20:04,160
and you know, you gotta,
you gotta decipher it.

2567
02:20:04,161 --> 02:20:06,950
You gotta hire a local guy who
speaks to the Lang. No, it's, it's,

2568
02:20:06,951 --> 02:20:08,420
it's fucking easy as shit,
man.

2569
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:12,730
It's really easy and this is not
going to change. I think that,

2570
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:13,730
I know what the crazy thing is,

2571
02:20:13,731 --> 02:20:17,990
is the Internet was originally the
Department of Defense Project and now it's

2572
02:20:17,991 --> 02:20:20,840
going to, it's going to bite
them in the air, but it's not,

2573
02:20:20,841 --> 02:20:24,620
it's still,
we need them still.

2574
02:20:24,621 --> 02:20:28,940
We just don't need them as a daddy.
Okay. No Man needs another man.

2575
02:20:28,941 --> 02:20:33,620
As a fucking Daddy, you know, what we
need is camaraderie and we need community.

2576
02:20:33,621 --> 02:20:38,090
We need the government to rethink what
they really are. They are one of us there.

2577
02:20:38,091 --> 02:20:39,680
We're all in this together.

2578
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:43,490
It's not like the Stanford prison
studies where they, you know,

2579
02:20:43,491 --> 02:20:45,860
took college kids and they had,

2580
02:20:45,861 --> 02:20:49,160
some of them become guards and someone
become prisoners and he immediately see

2581
02:20:49,161 --> 02:20:54,020
corruption and abuse. It doesn't have to
be prisoners and guards. It shouldn't be,

2582
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:55,010
but that's what it is.

2583
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:58,850
We have a government that's set up
that's not a part of our community.

2584
02:20:58,850 --> 02:21:00,080
That's not one of us.

2585
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:03,620
We have instead people that are trying
to tell us what to do or the or,

2586
02:21:03,621 --> 02:21:07,070
we'll lock you up and they suck
at what they do. They suck.

2587
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:10,760
They're incompetent and they're shitty
at their job. So they like to hide.

2588
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:13,010
They'll like to hide information.

2589
02:21:13,011 --> 02:21:16,700
They'd like to make it really hard for
you to get ahold of anything that shows

2590
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:20,690
that they suck at their job and when
you bust them suck at their job and you

2591
02:21:20,691 --> 02:21:23,540
need to distribute that information,
you become an enemy of the state.

2592
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:26,900
Like wikileaks. I mean stop and
think about what we cause has done.

2593
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:30,410
Wiki leaks in releasing that
collateral murder video.

2594
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:35,560
Let people know how calloused war can
make regular good Americans and turn

2595
02:21:35,921 --> 02:21:37,610
soldiers into people that don't care.

2596
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:41,300
Don't care that innocent people got
gunned down in the street and that make

2597
02:21:41,301 --> 02:21:45,770
jokes and talk lightly about machine
gunning vans filled with people,

2598
02:21:45,771 --> 02:21:49,640
including children. I mean this is,
this is fact. You watch that video,

2599
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:53,390
it makes you feel bad for
the guys who are shooting.

2600
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:55,460
It makes you feel bad for
the people on the ground.

2601
02:21:55,550 --> 02:21:58,640
The whole thing makes you feel bad
because the whole thing is just off.

2602
02:21:58,970 --> 02:22:02,690
It's just wrong and crazy
and not what we want.

2603
02:22:02,691 --> 02:22:06,290
When we think about the United
States of America in a proud way,

2604
02:22:06,291 --> 02:22:09,800
we think of ourselves as being
the, you know, a noble country,

2605
02:22:09,801 --> 02:22:11,980
a country filled with people that uh,

2606
02:22:11,981 --> 02:22:16,981
are rugged individual is that figured
out a way to escape from the monarchy of

2607
02:22:17,391 --> 02:22:20,120
England and come over
here and do it on our own.

2608
02:22:20,121 --> 02:22:21,980
And this time we're going to
have freedom and we're going to,

2609
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:24,830
we're going to have the constitution and
we're going to make sure that we have

2610
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:26,030
rules in place so

2611
02:22:26,030 --> 02:22:30,070
the corruption can, and then you see
just massive amounts of corruption.

2612
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:33,990
Where there 40, 50 years ago, I mean,
we had a guest, well, we had the, okay,

2613
02:22:33,991 --> 02:22:36,480
I guess we had a guest on two weeks
ago and we talked about Islam.

2614
02:22:36,481 --> 02:22:40,110
He's a Muslim guy who lives in
Britain. He's from Pakistan,
and he was like, Brian,

2615
02:22:40,111 --> 02:22:42,380
when I grew up in the early
eighties late seventies I was like,

2616
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:45,480
we had all these wonderful ideas of
what the u s it was something good.

2617
02:22:45,810 --> 02:22:47,700
Maybe we were also anti-soviet
at the time, I don't know,

2618
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:51,060
also didn't have the Internet. That's
a big part of it that we didn't know.

2619
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:54,390
No one knew about it, didn't know what
we were doing. Operation Northwoods man,

2620
02:22:54,391 --> 02:22:59,391
that was in the 1960s in the 1960s they
were going to blow up airplanes and they

2621
02:22:59,671 --> 02:23:04,671
were going to throw a bombs and attack
a Guantanamo Bay and they were going to

2622
02:23:05,401 --> 02:23:09,150
blame it on Cubans. So we'd go to war
with Cuba and that's a, that's a fact.

2623
02:23:09,151 --> 02:23:11,580
The freedom of Information Act
has released all the documents.

2624
02:23:11,940 --> 02:23:15,150
It wasn't a pipe dream. It was
signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

2625
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:18,750
but do we have a less favorable
view globally now American
than say 30 years ago?

2626
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:21,870
Yes, because of the Internet
and because of the Iraq war,

2627
02:23:21,871 --> 02:23:26,010
the Iraq war and Afghanistan
and the subsequent damage.

2628
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:30,330
And then of course in other countries with
the drone attacks, you know, and look,

2629
02:23:30,331 --> 02:23:34,350
I don't know how much of a threat alcaide
it is. I don't understand. I'm not,

2630
02:23:34,351 --> 02:23:37,980
I'm not privy to that information. They
don't let us, you know, we're not a,

2631
02:23:37,981 --> 02:23:39,260
we don't get access to Todd.

2632
02:23:39,270 --> 02:23:42,270
I don't know how many different
attacks on America they've,

2633
02:23:42,330 --> 02:23:46,380
they've caught it at a second successful
attack since nine 11 which is crazy.

2634
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:47,273
It's crazy.

2635
02:23:47,430 --> 02:23:50,040
But it's also crazy that anybody
wants to attack us in the first place.

2636
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:54,420
Why they met and would George Bush
the only nonsense we ever got us,

2637
02:23:54,810 --> 02:23:58,180
they hate our freedom. And
you're like, you motherfucker.
That's it. That doesn't a,

2638
02:23:58,370 --> 02:24:00,900
it doesn't. I always wonder if
America as a sovereign entity,

2639
02:24:00,901 --> 02:24:01,950
if it was actually attacked,

2640
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:05,900
which has never really been on its own
soil except for nine 11 but that was okay

2641
02:24:05,930 --> 02:24:08,760
to building. All right, Hawaii.
All right guys, you're killing me.

2642
02:24:09,230 --> 02:24:11,850
What everyone von together
or is that you said earlier,

2643
02:24:11,851 --> 02:24:13,920
is it a nation that's not,
that's fragmented. I mean,

2644
02:24:14,010 --> 02:24:17,340
if the way is Louisiana got attack
would be la people feel like,

2645
02:24:17,341 --> 02:24:18,091
well fuck you guys.

2646
02:24:18,091 --> 02:24:22,350
Or would you get drafted and sign your
kids up to go and die to defend those

2647
02:24:22,351 --> 02:24:23,670
borders?
Well,

2648
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:28,700
after nine 11 what happened here was
everywhere you go you would see flags,

2649
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:30,840
American flags,

2650
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:35,430
like within the first couple months after
nine 11 everyone's car had a flag on

2651
02:24:35,431 --> 02:24:38,520
Manhattan too. I was
there. It was nuts, man.

2652
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:42,360
Especially in New York where everyone's
an asshole. Yeah. Can you talk about it?

2653
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:44,160
Cause it's the one place
where people are just,

2654
02:24:44,161 --> 02:24:47,880
but they were friendly all of a sudden.
Weird in a creepy way. It was weird.

2655
02:24:47,881 --> 02:24:49,710
It was real weird.
I remember going to New York,

2656
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:54,740
we went maybe a year after September
11th and it was still like reverberating.

2657
02:24:55,710 --> 02:24:59,680
It was the ripples and aftershocks of
nine 11 people were way nicer than they'd

2658
02:24:59,681 --> 02:25:02,670
ever been before. Way more
friendly way, way more humble,

2659
02:25:02,671 --> 02:25:06,060
way more respectful for law
enforcement and firefighters.

2660
02:25:06,061 --> 02:25:09,400
They were really respectful,
but it's not human.

2661
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:12,570
Fred on the global scale for us to
pull together as a species. You know,

2662
02:25:12,571 --> 02:25:16,050
maybe an asteroid does need to hit the
earth and a quarter of the population has

2663
02:25:16,051 --> 02:25:18,390
to die so we all go fuck and hell,
we need each other.

2664
02:25:18,391 --> 02:25:19,740
We got to stop being
con through each other.

2665
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:23,920
It's unfortunate that in this model of
civilization it doesn't like there's any

2666
02:25:23,921 --> 02:25:24,100
other

2667
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,500
way for us to learn other
than shit falling apart.

2668
02:25:26,710 --> 02:25:29,740
It's not like we can just look
at things and say, hey listen,

2669
02:25:30,310 --> 02:25:33,430
obviously we're doing this wrong and we're
going to have to figure out how to do

2670
02:25:33,431 --> 02:25:36,580
it right and one in the process of
figuring out how to do things right.

2671
02:25:36,730 --> 02:25:39,580
There's a lot of shit that's going to
go away and one of the things is people

2672
02:25:39,581 --> 02:25:40,690
who have billions of dollars,

2673
02:25:40,691 --> 02:25:42,760
you're not going to have billions
of dollars anymore because it's not,

2674
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,860
your money is nonsense.
Okay?

2675
02:25:44,861 --> 02:25:48,100
Your money is basically a bunch of fucking
things that are in a bank somewhere.

2676
02:25:48,310 --> 02:25:53,310
And instead what we got to seek to do
is we've got to seek to have a resource

2677
02:25:53,441 --> 02:25:55,960
based economy,
a real resource based economy.

2678
02:25:55,990 --> 02:25:59,770
Then we've got to figure out who owns
these resources and how should these

2679
02:25:59,771 --> 02:26:01,330
resources really be distributed.

2680
02:26:01,331 --> 02:26:05,620
Sued should shump somebody be able to
camp in front of a diamond hole in the

2681
02:26:05,621 --> 02:26:08,470
earth and say, this is my fucking
hall. These are mine diamonds.

2682
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:12,790
It's like Jeremy Frescoes long lost son.
Do you really own those diamonds?

2683
02:26:12,791 --> 02:26:15,940
Do you really own that
gold really owned that oil?

2684
02:26:15,941 --> 02:26:20,941
Well like who's who's to say
that these resources or yours,

2685
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:25,480
should it not be that the resources
are what powers our economy?

2686
02:26:25,630 --> 02:26:29,710
Should it not be that the resources
instead or what powers our government and

2687
02:26:29,711 --> 02:26:31,900
that no one really owns them.

2688
02:26:31,901 --> 02:26:35,920
And then they're distributed to all the
people that claim the earth as their

2689
02:26:35,921 --> 02:26:40,510
home. And that sounds co Raisie
hippie nonsense socialist.

2690
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:45,930
But the reality is you shouldn't be able
to fucking build a giant machine and

2691
02:26:45,971 --> 02:26:50,971
park at 10 miles off Louisiana in the
middle of the ocean and just suck billions

2692
02:26:51,610 --> 02:26:55,090
of dollars out of the earth and then
not give any of that back and then say,

2693
02:26:55,091 --> 02:26:57,730
this is ours.
We'd get all it was sucking all your,

2694
02:26:57,731 --> 02:27:01,220
you're draining the earth like a
giant mosquito bat vampire though.

2695
02:27:01,220 --> 02:27:04,180
Accountability when you put it that
not only know con accountability,

2696
02:27:04,181 --> 02:27:06,070
you're making money off the earth,

2697
02:27:06,370 --> 02:27:10,780
billions of dollars and you're making
it off the earth in international waters

2698
02:27:10,990 --> 02:27:12,700
or you're making it a national waters.

2699
02:27:12,701 --> 02:27:16,540
Are you making it in a bay or who
the fuck is, why is that yours?

2700
02:27:16,690 --> 02:27:17,980
Like what's yours? Cause you, you,

2701
02:27:17,981 --> 02:27:22,981
you got a contract to build this giant
sucking machine and where's that money

2702
02:27:23,051 --> 02:27:25,840
going? That's a lot of money. You can
control a lot of shit with that money.

2703
02:27:26,060 --> 02:27:29,440
You're making billions and billions and
billions of dollars off of oil money,

2704
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:33,490
man. You know what kind of fucking
power you have to by lobbyists.

2705
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:37,360
You know what kind of pal you have to
influence legislative law legislation.

2706
02:27:37,390 --> 02:27:39,100
You'd have a lot of fucking power.

2707
02:27:39,130 --> 02:27:42,460
Imagine if you get could zero out all
the bank accounts in the world. I look,

2708
02:27:42,470 --> 02:27:43,660
that seems white glove at the end.

2709
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:48,040
When we had the financial crisis
in London in 2008 apparently RBS,

2710
02:27:48,041 --> 02:27:50,110
one of the banks have
Royal Bank of Scotland.

2711
02:27:50,380 --> 02:27:53,890
They were one day away from shutting
off the ATM machines and they were

2712
02:27:53,891 --> 02:27:56,380
seriously,
if you've ever thought of a food riot,

2713
02:27:56,410 --> 02:28:00,370
if you can think of people not being able
to touch their money. Oh my God. Really?

2714
02:28:00,371 --> 02:28:04,510
It was just, yeah. I mean, wow. Be some
man. Yeah, that would be some mayhem.

2715
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:08,280
And you know, it's happened in little
small doses with the collapse of us in,

2716
02:28:08,281 --> 02:28:09,640
in America.
It's happened a bunch of,

2717
02:28:09,641 --> 02:28:13,840
there's a savings and loan collapse
that George Bush's son was involved in.

2718
02:28:13,841 --> 02:28:16,060
That was a huge scandal that,
you know,

2719
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:18,070
cost people millions
and millions of dollars.

2720
02:28:18,071 --> 02:28:22,040
A lot of people's personal fortunes
were completely erased their life.

2721
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:26,030
Vinnie Paz, the ends of the boxer, he
lost hundreds of thousands of dollars,

2722
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:29,840
just gone. Disappeared. Sorry. We don't
have it anymore. You know, and that's,

2723
02:28:30,350 --> 02:28:34,940
that's what a part of this financial
bailout was in this, in this country.

2724
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:38,960
The most recent one was trying to avoid
something like that happening with all

2725
02:28:38,961 --> 02:28:41,630
these big banks failing.
But at the end of the day,

2726
02:28:42,730 --> 02:28:47,360
if you're going to have a
society that is well designed,

2727
02:28:47,690 --> 02:28:52,380
you can't use an infrastructure that is
not well designed and maintain it. The,

2728
02:28:52,381 --> 02:28:53,061
the, the, the, the,

2729
02:28:53,061 --> 02:28:57,770
the structure that we have now is so
fucked up and corrupt and crazy and the

2730
02:28:57,771 --> 02:28:59,950
crux is starting to
show is a real big cats.

2731
02:28:59,990 --> 02:29:03,740
It's like having a giant building
made out of cardboard instead of just

2732
02:29:03,770 --> 02:29:06,710
acknowledging it.
You just throwing duct tape up everywhere.

2733
02:29:06,711 --> 02:29:11,140
It starts to separate you.
We've got to figure out a way for it to,

2734
02:29:11,210 --> 02:29:16,210
to be a society that makes sense and
the way that that's going to happen.

2735
02:29:16,300 --> 02:29:20,690
The only way that's going to happen
is you got to restructure finance.

2736
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:23,420
You've got to restructure
what money really is.

2737
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:27,470
You've got to restructure how
much money and how much, uh,

2738
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:30,260
how much people get
paid to do certain jobs.

2739
02:29:30,260 --> 02:29:33,920
Because like most people
are fucking slaves.

2740
02:29:34,050 --> 02:29:35,590
They are just slaves with uh,

2741
02:29:35,690 --> 02:29:39,860
the Gov a loose Coloradan they're slaves
because of, and you know, by the way,

2742
02:29:39,861 --> 02:29:42,740
that's your choice.
You can not do that and you can,

2743
02:29:43,130 --> 02:29:47,840
I agree with all that. You know, you
can not be burdened by, you know,

2744
02:29:47,841 --> 02:29:52,020
a home and mortgage and finances and,
and you know,

2745
02:29:52,021 --> 02:29:55,610
a car payments and all that stuff. But
you know, what would really be better?

2746
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,710
How about if you do actually work all day?

2747
02:30:00,860 --> 02:30:05,120
You get paid enough so that you could
save money and you don't have to worry

2748
02:30:05,121 --> 02:30:05,954
about shit.

2749
02:30:06,050 --> 02:30:09,980
You get paid enough so that you don't
have to worry about being constantly in

2750
02:30:09,981 --> 02:30:10,161
debt.

2751
02:30:10,161 --> 02:30:13,700
The idea of owning a house shouldn't be
out of someone's reach should be fairly

2752
02:30:13,701 --> 02:30:17,270
fucking acquirable.
That would make a lot more sense.

2753
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:22,450
We just live in this really corrupt
system of loans and interest and just

2754
02:30:23,511 --> 02:30:27,680
nonsense number shuffling
and can tell you this.

2755
02:30:28,230 --> 02:30:31,010
I just don't know how we're going to
get there without blood everywhere.

2756
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:31,950
You're right.
That's it.

2757
02:30:32,030 --> 02:30:37,030
I don't know either or
massive enlightenment and
that massive enlightenment.

2758
02:30:37,490 --> 02:30:37,820
Look.

2759
02:30:37,820 --> 02:30:42,820
Something happened for sure during the
60s and a lot of people attributed to

2760
02:30:43,610 --> 02:30:47,320
psychedelic drugs and the music change.
The culture change.

2761
02:30:47,321 --> 02:30:49,930
The society changed the
doors recently. Yeah, that's,

2762
02:30:50,570 --> 02:30:53,360
that's a big leap from buddy
Holly. Man, some big leaps.

2763
02:30:53,361 --> 02:30:56,540
Something happened that was a media form
back then. I was telling nick today,

2764
02:30:56,541 --> 02:30:58,250
how do you spread a message
without the Internet?

2765
02:30:58,251 --> 02:31:00,570
You do it over music and he listened to
Morris and his lyrics and you're like

2766
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:03,500
changed kids. It changed kids.
That's one of the big things.

2767
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:05,570
I guess the closest thing to Joe,

2768
02:31:05,571 --> 02:31:08,930
back in the day in the sixties and
seventies you know that black Sabbath's on

2769
02:31:08,931 --> 02:31:12,660
war pigs. Oh, rip van. Can you pull it up?

2770
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:16,070
We had just a message through the,
through the music,

2771
02:31:16,071 --> 02:31:18,290
but you're always talking about that.
Get the kids to change first.

2772
02:31:18,291 --> 02:31:19,980
Is that your only everybody,
man.

2773
02:31:19,981 --> 02:31:22,620
Everybody that I talked to that
comes up to me and says, dude,

2774
02:31:22,650 --> 02:31:25,440
this podcast has changed my life.
He changed the way I look at things,

2775
02:31:25,441 --> 02:31:27,630
change the way I approached my life.
I realized that this,

2776
02:31:27,631 --> 02:31:29,310
this is not a permanent experience.

2777
02:31:29,550 --> 02:31:33,930
This is supposed to be a
ride and an enjoyable time,

2778
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:36,930
a finite time that I can manage,

2779
02:31:37,110 --> 02:31:39,660
and if I just stick to a
certain amount of principles,

2780
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:43,410
a certain series of principles,
rather go towards what you love,

2781
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:44,820
actually do what you want to do,

2782
02:31:44,821 --> 02:31:48,030
be nice to people and have a
close knit circle of friends.

2783
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:50,730
Love them as if you love yourself.
To true,

2784
02:31:50,731 --> 02:31:55,560
to really move in that direction is
possible for all of us. And that's,

2785
02:31:55,590 --> 02:31:58,590
that's the way you change the world,
the way it changed the world.

2786
02:31:58,591 --> 02:32:00,720
As you change the way people
look at things so that the,

2787
02:32:00,740 --> 02:32:05,220
nobody wants to be the the big content
charge because the big content charge

2788
02:32:05,221 --> 02:32:07,560
leaves a shit life. You
know these guys, look,

2789
02:32:07,561 --> 02:32:12,561
we live in a world where when kids get
crazy and they make a lot of noise in

2790
02:32:13,321 --> 02:32:16,950
there, they're fucking hard to deal with.
People give these kids antidepressants,

2791
02:32:16,951 --> 02:32:18,990
they give them Ritalin,
they give them, you know,

2792
02:32:19,010 --> 02:32:22,590
all kinds of different crazy shit.
Then when they get to be adults,

2793
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:26,400
then they're even more fucked up and
sad and disconnected with their shitty

2794
02:32:26,401 --> 02:32:28,710
lives.
So then we give them antidepressants.

2795
02:32:28,711 --> 02:32:33,450
We give them more things to help them
get over this little mental hump.

2796
02:32:33,690 --> 02:32:36,810
Then there dick stops working.
What did they do? Well we come up,

2797
02:32:36,811 --> 02:32:40,470
we got to Cialis and Viagra and Levitra
and all sorts of pills that make your

2798
02:32:40,471 --> 02:32:44,760
dick hard. Well you know, we'll
dumb fucking this, this stuff.

2799
02:32:44,790 --> 02:32:46,560
This isn't helping me anymore.

2800
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:49,940
Oh we got some other stuff that
you add on to your antidepressant.

2801
02:32:49,980 --> 02:32:53,460
You take this as well as that and this
is really going to put you over the top

2802
02:32:53,461 --> 02:32:54,840
and that's really gonna make you happy.

2803
02:32:55,020 --> 02:33:00,020
And we constantly keep looking for
some sort of a chemical fix for,

2804
02:33:01,290 --> 02:33:06,270
for, for depression and for, for the
lack of good feelings in this life.

2805
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:11,540
And I think that there's certainly people
that have mental imbalances and they

2806
02:33:11,610 --> 02:33:14,940
are helped by pharmaceutical drugs,
by antidepressants.

2807
02:33:15,150 --> 02:33:16,650
But that not withstanding,

2808
02:33:16,651 --> 02:33:21,651
there is also people that are getting a
very bad signal from their life because

2809
02:33:21,901 --> 02:33:25,800
they're living a life that is
non harmonious. It's not fun,

2810
02:33:25,890 --> 02:33:30,000
it's not filled with love and joy.
They're not pursuing their true interests.

2811
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:32,130
And everybody's interest
is fucking different.

2812
02:33:32,340 --> 02:33:35,460
And our natural state is to
be joyful and calm and happy.

2813
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:36,510
And if you look at those,

2814
02:33:36,511 --> 02:33:39,780
all those stories of when people in
common to most indigenous cultures,

2815
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:41,760
everyone's cool. Yeah.
You know what I mean?

2816
02:33:41,761 --> 02:33:44,640
It was also people that
love to be depressed. Okay.

2817
02:33:44,641 --> 02:33:47,310
And these people that revel in
depression take pride in depression.

2818
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:50,250
Unfortunately, people that have criticized
me for talking about depression,

2819
02:33:50,490 --> 02:33:53,730
even in my own message board, some
fucking dummies wrote some stupid shit.

2820
02:33:53,910 --> 02:33:56,940
It was so sad. It's so poorly
thought out. Listening.

2821
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:59,400
Does anybody get furious when you know,

2822
02:33:59,401 --> 02:34:02,250
you hear Joe talk about depression
because if you understand,

2823
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:05,880
you don't think I've been
depressed before, stupid.
Everybody has been depressed.

2824
02:34:05,881 --> 02:34:08,380
People don't know that. You
have always a positive. Yeah.

2825
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:10,560
Well that it took a long
time to get positive.

2826
02:34:10,561 --> 02:34:13,080
I've had a really awkward social moment,

2827
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:17,560
really dark moments of terrible
feeling and that lasted months, months.

2828
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:22,150
We will all have. Was there anything in
particular that got you through it? Um,

2829
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:27,520
just that helps certainly. But then that
can be a source of even more depression.

2830
02:34:27,521 --> 02:34:31,180
Yeah. Yeah. Tell me about it. To a
hold of a bad one. What do you tell?

2831
02:34:31,210 --> 02:34:33,550
Because people are always
asking you for answers.

2832
02:34:33,551 --> 02:34:35,720
I know you don't want to be
the guy. You're like, I'm
not the guy trying to talk.

2833
02:34:35,721 --> 02:34:37,750
You tell you what I've learned
to help people. You know,

2834
02:34:37,751 --> 02:34:40,590
you can never tell people what to do,
but you can tell people what helped you,

2835
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:41,180
you know?

2836
02:34:41,180 --> 02:34:45,820
And you could tell people what has aided
you and where you were going wrong and

2837
02:34:45,821 --> 02:34:50,620
how you saw it and corrected it.
So a big part of life is,

2838
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:54,850
is got to be the way you
interact with human beings.

2839
02:34:54,851 --> 02:34:57,040
The happiness that you
derived from friendships,

2840
02:34:57,041 --> 02:35:00,130
the happiness that you derive
from doing things together from,

2841
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:02,230
and also from creating things,
you know,

2842
02:35:02,250 --> 02:35:07,250
and the happiness that whether it's
creating carpentry or art or we are some

2843
02:35:07,421 --> 02:35:12,421
weird animal that constantly seeks to
use the imagination to make physical

2844
02:35:12,581 --> 02:35:14,380
things manifest themselves.
You know,

2845
02:35:14,381 --> 02:35:17,800
whether it's physical things in terms
of some things you can read online or

2846
02:35:17,801 --> 02:35:21,490
something that you could watch as
an a video podcast, whatever it is.

2847
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:26,440
We have this massive amount
of satisfaction that we
get out of making things

2848
02:35:26,470 --> 02:35:30,950
cause we're some weird fucking be thing
where some weird insects and making a

2849
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:34,480
hive. We're just making
this super complicated hive.

2850
02:35:34,481 --> 02:35:38,290
It's connected by billions and billions
of other little fucking weird pink

2851
02:35:38,291 --> 02:35:39,460
monkeys and we,

2852
02:35:39,461 --> 02:35:43,660
or brown monkeys and black monkeys and
yellow monkeys and we're all putting it

2853
02:35:43,661 --> 02:35:46,740
all together and we don't
know what it is. We don't, we,

2854
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:50,560
we all are responsible for our own
little piece of this crazy machine called

2855
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:53,170
culture and civilization.
We don't know what the fuck we're doing,

2856
02:35:53,171 --> 02:35:58,171
but clearly we're all working together
and some weird form and you can accept

2857
02:35:59,531 --> 02:36:03,820
that and you can, you can choose
to be depressed. You can choose to,

2858
02:36:04,150 --> 02:36:08,170
you can choose to live a,
an ineffective, inefficient,

2859
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:12,230
non harmonious life because it's gonna
make your mother-in-law happy and,

2860
02:36:12,350 --> 02:36:15,950
and keep your marriage
together. Or you can, you know,

2861
02:36:16,220 --> 02:36:21,220
seek silence and calmness and truly
examine your situation and then slowly try

2862
02:36:22,991 --> 02:36:24,460
to turn that boat around.

2863
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:28,570
Slowly tried to turn that battleship
towards where it needs to go.

2864
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:30,120
I think Ari Shaffir said one time,
he said,

2865
02:36:30,130 --> 02:36:32,440
start with the people in your daily life.
He's like,

2866
02:36:32,441 --> 02:36:36,250
be nice to the waiter and be nice
to this person. And you know, it's,

2867
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:40,230
it can be started really simple. That's
my shit. Drop, drop happiness bombs, Dan,

2868
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:43,060
I'm gonna Start doing this.
You can do it. It helps life.

2869
02:36:43,350 --> 02:36:48,350
It puts forth more positive energy and
that sounds like Hippie dippie bullshit.

2870
02:36:48,371 --> 02:36:51,880
But it puts forth better feelings.
You feel better about the day.

2871
02:36:51,881 --> 02:36:54,360
And I think when you feel
better about the day you,

2872
02:36:54,390 --> 02:36:57,090
you think better about the
future, you think you, you,

2873
02:36:57,091 --> 02:37:01,210
you respond better to other people.
You set this ball in motion.

2874
02:37:01,211 --> 02:37:04,030
And when you make someone feel better
than they make someone else feel better,

2875
02:37:04,031 --> 02:37:07,560
like you know, if rscs me tip
people or be nice and then he says,

2876
02:37:07,590 --> 02:37:10,030
know I'm going to fucking do that too.
And then you hear about that and you say,

2877
02:37:10,031 --> 02:37:13,420
I'm going to do that too. And when, when
that happens and someone hearing this is,

2878
02:37:13,421 --> 02:37:17,360
that's how I'm going to do that is
just ripples and ripples of positive

2879
02:37:17,361 --> 02:37:22,361
reactions or can raise our collective
consciousness ultimately as much if not

2880
02:37:23,001 --> 02:37:25,580
more than anything that's
ever existed in human history.

2881
02:37:25,610 --> 02:37:29,300
The biggest bursts of change that I've
ever come forth in human history are

2882
02:37:29,301 --> 02:37:31,910
nothing compared to the reactions
that people are going to get to.

2883
02:37:31,911 --> 02:37:36,860
The free access of information and
content that the Internet has. The the,

2884
02:37:36,861 --> 02:37:41,240
the impact of the 60s ain't shit compared
to the impacts of the two thousands

2885
02:37:41,241 --> 02:37:43,280
and the 2000 tens and twenties there.

2886
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:47,630
It's going to be log
rhythmically expanding.

2887
02:37:49,490 --> 02:37:52,250
We can't even wrap our heads around
where it's going and that's why the

2888
02:37:52,251 --> 02:37:53,630
government is panicking.

2889
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:58,840
That's why they're building this
giant NSA spy fucking cabin in Utah,

2890
02:37:59,450 --> 02:38:03,320
one of the biggest, most expensive
projects that governments ever undertaken.

2891
02:38:03,530 --> 02:38:07,160
No money for Neil degrasse Tyson's
gigantic telescope to see the beginning of

2892
02:38:07,161 --> 02:38:07,640
time,

2893
02:38:07,640 --> 02:38:11,690
but they've got plenty of money to build
such a switch yourself holding to store

2894
02:38:11,691 --> 02:38:16,691
every fucking email you've ever written
to to take everybody's I a laptop

2895
02:38:17,690 --> 02:38:22,160
fucking camera and turn it on to watch
you beating off and store it and put it

2896
02:38:22,161 --> 02:38:25,940
in some fucking database somewhere and
you think that's a joke, but it's not.

2897
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:30,890
It's true. Your fucking cell phone is
basically a giant gps tracking device.

2898
02:38:30,940 --> 02:38:33,680
That's all it is. It's scary.
You know, before I forget,

2899
02:38:33,681 --> 02:38:36,080
I just want to offer up London
real studios for you guys.

2900
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:39,560
If you're ever in town to you know,
use as you as your studios if you want.

2901
02:38:39,590 --> 02:38:43,520
You guys want to like that would be dope.
If wherever in England for a UFC,

2902
02:38:43,521 --> 02:38:44,720
that's when I usually come over.
I mean,

2903
02:38:44,721 --> 02:38:46,190
obviously it would love
you guys on the show,

2904
02:38:46,191 --> 02:38:48,730
but if you ever want to just use
the studios and I'm wrecking,

2905
02:38:48,750 --> 02:38:51,070
you might be able get the queen
on your show or you guys got,

2906
02:38:52,040 --> 02:38:55,240
maybe you can get some crazy people that
are in England or in Europe or Terry or

2907
02:38:55,250 --> 02:38:59,300
one of those dudes. Is that a prince
or is that one of the ugly warts?

2908
02:38:59,540 --> 02:39:02,420
These are guys, he's a real
one. I never know who's, uh,

2909
02:39:02,450 --> 02:39:05,720
who's from Melinda's a trippy
place man is what does that show?

2910
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:07,910
What's the movie again?
Harry Potter. Potter.

2911
02:39:07,911 --> 02:39:11,540
I never know if it's from Harry Potter
or real. He's real, but a red band shirt.

2912
02:39:11,540 --> 02:39:15,290
It says keep calm and carry on, on his, on
the front of his shirt. And that's like,

2913
02:39:15,350 --> 02:39:18,150
that pretty much says a lot about Britain,
you know. I mean, nick and I were,

2914
02:39:18,151 --> 02:39:19,970
were actually foreigners,
which is crazy.

2915
02:39:20,180 --> 02:39:22,910
And we started a show called London real,
I mean, I'm American, he's South African.

2916
02:39:22,911 --> 02:39:24,560
So what brought you guys to England?

2917
02:39:25,310 --> 02:39:29,130
I went for Bizzo and 10 years ago
financing. What'd you go for? Your,

2918
02:39:29,870 --> 02:39:31,220
I wanted to train Jujitsu.

2919
02:39:31,221 --> 02:39:35,100
I'm under it like someone high level so
instead of Roger. Right. Nice. So you,

2920
02:39:35,101 --> 02:39:37,970
when you moved to England for
hydro, Gracie, hydro, Roger,

2921
02:39:37,971 --> 02:39:41,520
some people call high some on the
show and he said either these guys,

2922
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:44,940
the Brazilians Guy, they all
say Hodra. Yeah. You know,

2923
02:39:45,710 --> 02:39:46,760
he's a scary guy but

2924
02:39:48,350 --> 02:39:51,380
he's got the perfect Jujitsu body
to those long limbs. You know,

2925
02:39:51,381 --> 02:39:54,620
he's a big tall dude. I was surprised
when he came over. I was like,

2926
02:39:54,621 --> 02:39:57,680
I forgot how tall were you shocked when
he got knocked out by King Mo? Yeah,

2927
02:39:57,681 --> 02:40:00,860
I asked him about it on the show. Uh,
but I was surprised. But then again,

2928
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:04,430
like you said, on any, on any
day and chemos got some power.

2929
02:40:04,550 --> 02:40:08,630
That's what's scary about wrestlers to,
if a wrestler, a develops knockout power,

2930
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:12,240
the odds of you getting him down.
It's Kinda small. You know, it's real.

2931
02:40:12,340 --> 02:40:14,300
It's going to be hard to
get a wrestler down Jujitsu

2932
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:18,420
guys versus wrestlers. Always a
weird sort of a, a combination.

2933
02:40:18,421 --> 02:40:21,600
Because if the Jujitsu guy can't get the
wrestler down and the rest of the guys

2934
02:40:21,601 --> 02:40:25,590
like a chocolate Dell guy, it's
bad for the Jujitsu Guy, you know?

2935
02:40:25,620 --> 02:40:28,320
But if the Jujitsu guy can
get the wrestler guy down,

2936
02:40:28,321 --> 02:40:31,190
a lot of times wrestlers have some bad
habits off their background. It's good.

2937
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:33,300
Yeah, it's a, it's, it's,

2938
02:40:33,301 --> 02:40:37,230
it's interesting but that that king mo
fight shows you like a wrestler with some

2939
02:40:37,231 --> 02:40:40,740
serious power like King Mo.
That's a dangerous guy.

2940
02:40:40,770 --> 02:40:43,230
It's a dangerous guy to fight if you're
trying to take the fight to the ground.

2941
02:40:43,650 --> 02:40:46,110
It's weird. I asked Roger Wise in
London, cause he's a Brazilian guy,

2942
02:40:46,111 --> 02:40:49,380
you think it's the last place he'd want
to go right to the land of rain and they

2943
02:40:49,381 --> 02:40:52,080
say bad food. Lend it has some good
food, man. We just got to eat food.

2944
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:53,970
I don't know where to go.
It was like an old bill Hicks joke.

2945
02:40:53,971 --> 02:40:58,680
You don't boil pizza. Hold
bit about money. Food being
bad. I'm like, you're crazy.

2946
02:40:58,681 --> 02:41:01,920
The Indian food, they're
sensational. We've had some great,

2947
02:41:01,980 --> 02:41:04,860
great Chinese food there.
Do you guys think that you got to London?

2948
02:41:04,861 --> 02:41:08,460
What does it feel like? Weird or, I love
it. I love London. I love the people.

2949
02:41:08,461 --> 02:41:09,330
I think they're there.

2950
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:14,510
I think there's so much competitive
craziness in America and there's so much

2951
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:19,260
arrogance in the American
attitude, which is, you know,

2952
02:41:19,261 --> 02:41:22,680
one of the things that built the
country sort of built, yeah. Made it,

2953
02:41:22,930 --> 02:41:26,730
it's fucking nutty as it is,
but it also makes it just exhausting.

2954
02:41:26,850 --> 02:41:28,560
I know the bit just
landing here from London,

2955
02:41:28,561 --> 02:41:30,230
it was like I was on Mars
and I walking around.

2956
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:33,360
I'm seeing in Venice beach and there
is like a little bit of an aggression

2957
02:41:33,361 --> 02:41:37,350
levels. What's not done everywhere.
We were in North Carolina,

2958
02:41:37,351 --> 02:41:40,890
we were in Asheville this past
weekend, uh, and a Raleigh, Raleigh,

2959
02:41:40,891 --> 02:41:42,840
Friday in Asheville,
a Saturday.

2960
02:41:43,110 --> 02:41:46,710
And Asheville is a goddamn gem of a town.

2961
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:49,400
It's just small town and I,

2962
02:41:49,450 --> 02:41:52,050
and everybody's walking on
the streets and you know,

2963
02:41:52,051 --> 02:41:53,400
we didn't even think about it.
Like,

2964
02:41:53,401 --> 02:41:56,310
where is this restaurant three blocks
up and to the right and we're all just

2965
02:41:56,311 --> 02:41:58,680
walking and everybody else is walking.
People walk everywhere.

2966
02:41:58,950 --> 02:42:02,070
And I'd be like that that's
missing in San Fran. In La,

2967
02:42:02,090 --> 02:42:04,050
it's completely missing in La.

2968
02:42:04,051 --> 02:42:07,950
Nobody walks anywhere you need to have
face to face contact the the tube in

2969
02:42:07,951 --> 02:42:10,980
London, which is the underground, you see
people face to face, you know, and you,

2970
02:42:10,990 --> 02:42:12,560
you,
you're constantly interacting with them,

2971
02:42:12,570 --> 02:42:16,980
seeing these crazy women wearing burkas
or some lady from Somalia and you're

2972
02:42:16,981 --> 02:42:20,100
smelling them and seeing them and
people just no more polite there too.

2973
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:23,250
It's almost super polite. And
Mackie you say, sorry first.

2974
02:42:23,251 --> 02:42:25,830
I mean I have there 10 years now and
like the first thing he say, sorry,

2975
02:42:26,130 --> 02:42:29,250
it's really annoying when you're here.
Oh, it's not, it's beautiful. It's just,

2976
02:42:29,251 --> 02:42:32,660
you know, it's, it's setting
forth good intentions right away.

2977
02:42:32,670 --> 02:42:37,350
The theory that if you look at a place
that's America's such a huge landmass

2978
02:42:37,351 --> 02:42:40,290
that it's not ever that densely populated.

2979
02:42:40,291 --> 02:42:42,900
If you compare it to like Tokyo or
London where we were on this tiny little

2980
02:42:43,410 --> 02:42:47,160
island. And what happens is in places
like that where it's so densely populated,

2981
02:42:47,161 --> 02:42:48,300
people are forced to be,

2982
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:51,550
they're forced to learn to be
able to live on top of each other.

2983
02:42:51,551 --> 02:42:54,200
And be nicer to each other because there's
nowhere out. There's no way to run.

2984
02:42:54,201 --> 02:42:55,710
I would agree with you.
Except for New York.

2985
02:42:55,711 --> 02:43:00,630
New York is filled with clients and the
stacked on top of these curl and shit

2986
02:43:00,631 --> 02:43:03,450
like chimpanzees. I lived there for a
few years and now it's too much for me.

2987
02:43:03,451 --> 02:43:07,020
It's um, it's not, it's, I hear
what you're saying, but no,

2988
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:11,890
I think it has to do with why people came
here in the first place. The ripples,

2989
02:43:11,891 --> 02:43:16,150
the first ripples of intention of the
people that landed, they were crazy.

2990
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:18,160
They were people who were so bold.

2991
02:43:18,161 --> 02:43:22,480
They got on a boat and sailed for months
across the fucking ocean is someplace,

2992
02:43:22,510 --> 02:43:25,900
they hadn't even seen a video
because video wasn't invented.

2993
02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:29,110
They were low CSTARS warning.

2994
02:43:29,350 --> 02:43:32,040
10 minute warning by London
I find is that there,

2995
02:43:32,060 --> 02:43:34,570
there are years behind the
technology curve. Like I know in La,

2996
02:43:34,571 --> 02:43:38,170
so many people have podcasts and maybe
in New York's probably lagged a couple of

2997
02:43:38,170 --> 02:43:40,990
years, but in London, I mean we totally
about London real and it's like,

2998
02:43:40,991 --> 02:43:42,850
it's a podcast and they'll be like,
it's a what?

2999
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:46,000
There's just not a lot of people
there yet. That's interesting.

3000
02:43:46,001 --> 02:43:47,470
But I think that'll change.
Let me just talk.

3001
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:51,220
You don't have access to computers and
an Internet connection microphones or you

3002
02:43:51,221 --> 02:43:54,160
could always buy them.
You know you guys will lead the way,

3003
02:43:54,460 --> 02:43:55,960
you know you'll be the ones and it's new.

3004
02:43:55,970 --> 02:43:57,850
That started out and at
first she showed people,

3005
02:43:57,851 --> 02:44:00,220
okay we have a show for an hour and
then they try to watch it like game of

3006
02:44:00,221 --> 02:44:02,770
Thrones for an hour. I was
like, oh it's not like that.

3007
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:07,720
Well you know we have a lot of people
who do live shows here and I don't like

3008
02:44:07,721 --> 02:44:11,650
those. They do them in front of audiences.
Marin, Marin does that for an audience.

3009
02:44:11,651 --> 02:44:13,950
I just turn it off cause it
always feels like it's different.

3010
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:16,810
Why are they trying to cater to the
audience and they're not talking to me.

3011
02:44:16,890 --> 02:44:20,500
They're faking on a ham it up
a little and you are aware.

3012
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:24,940
I no doubt that 50,000 fucking whatever
it is and isn't in the audience.

3013
02:44:24,941 --> 02:44:25,310
You know,

3014
02:44:25,310 --> 02:44:28,870
I guys have done them with thousands
of people I know to Corolla does like

3015
02:44:28,870 --> 02:44:32,860
thousand seats. You know, it's crazy. I
just thought it was not my thing, man.

3016
02:44:32,861 --> 02:44:36,340
I don't think we thought it's
not the right sort of a vibe.

3017
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:38,980
I think for podcasts
it's a different thing.

3018
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:42,240
Some people are good Norton's great at
it, nor atlas. Really good at doing.

3019
02:44:42,330 --> 02:44:44,200
He like turns it up,
you know?

3020
02:44:44,830 --> 02:44:47,290
Do you think we should go live because
we don't have a live format but it's

3021
02:44:47,291 --> 02:44:50,780
effectively live cause we don't edit
in his one hour. But I was curious.

3022
02:44:50,781 --> 02:44:53,770
I mean you guys do have live as you
do whatever the fuck you want, man.

3023
02:44:53,771 --> 02:44:57,820
It doesn't matter. I said, I love it,
but I hate it. I hated it. You hate it.

3024
02:44:57,820 --> 02:45:01,330
You still hate it. No, no,
no. He's not saying in front
of an audience. He's saying,

3025
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:06,130
Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, a lot.
Well, it's a pretty authentic,

3026
02:45:06,490 --> 02:45:10,760
everything we've said in this is,
it's been live for already been knows who,

3027
02:45:10,830 --> 02:45:13,450
how many fucking people, how many
people are listening to this from Brian?

3028
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:16,450
Come on, you know, how
do you know the numbers?

3029
02:45:16,660 --> 02:45:20,470
How many people do watch your
show all together? We don't know.

3030
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:25,210
Millions y'all. It's way. It's definitely
millions on Sirius radio right now.

3031
02:45:25,211 --> 02:45:28,440
We have 2100. Yeah. I mean like I'm just,

3032
02:45:28,441 --> 02:45:32,950
our Ustream page has 11
million, 454,000 views. Just,

3033
02:45:32,951 --> 02:45:36,520
just start page and way
more. Like, like he said,

3034
02:45:36,521 --> 02:45:39,190
there's only like 2000 people
watching at a time the most.

3035
02:45:39,191 --> 02:45:42,500
I think earlier it was probably close
to 3000 the most we've ever had.

3036
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:46,530
Like maybe nine or 10,000 at once
watching it. Yeah. But the, the,

3037
02:45:46,531 --> 02:45:50,950
the real numbers or an audible downloads,
audio downloads, MP, three downloads,

3038
02:45:51,030 --> 02:45:54,940
right. That's where it gets crazy. Can
we drop our info to come check us out?

3039
02:45:54,941 --> 02:45:59,530
All right. We're um, the website's
a London real. Dot TV. Uh,

3040
02:45:59,560 --> 02:46:03,160
we're on Twitter at London Real TV and
you can always check out our youtube

3041
02:46:03,161 --> 02:46:04,030
channel,
which is London.

3042
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:07,630
Real TV is a channel or just tied London
real into Google man. You'll find us.

3043
02:46:07,750 --> 02:46:10,750
And also guys that have a Jujitsu
site called Jujitsu Brotherhood.

3044
02:46:10,760 --> 02:46:13,490
That's all one word.
And I discussed my philosophies.

3045
02:46:13,491 --> 02:46:17,960
It's digital brother.com just talking
about my style of Jujitsu or everything's

3046
02:46:17,961 --> 02:46:20,090
free on there. You can go check it
out as well if you have a chance.

3047
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:23,960
Beautiful guys, if anybody wants to start
a podcast in any city around the world,

3048
02:46:23,990 --> 02:46:26,930
if you got questions, you can
email a message. Just call us.

3049
02:46:26,980 --> 02:46:29,300
Wouldn't be happy to help.
I'd love to see more of these things.

3050
02:46:29,301 --> 02:46:31,910
You don't have to call it real. You
can call it whatever the fuck you want,

3051
02:46:32,090 --> 02:46:35,000
but they end and maybe in one year
from today you can be on Joe show.

3052
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:40,320
Yeah, easily. Fuck man. I think
that's what it's all about, right?

3053
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:40,490
I mean,

3054
02:46:40,490 --> 02:46:45,490
I think it's all about encouraging
other people to carry this on and a,

3055
02:46:45,511 --> 02:46:48,750
you guys are doing it the perfect way.
It's beautiful to watch.

3056
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:52,050
I enjoyed watching your show.
I enjoyed listening to it,

3057
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:56,280
listening to your conversations with
Graham Hancock and Simon and a a bunch of

3058
02:46:56,281 --> 02:46:57,114
other ones I've seen too.

3059
02:46:57,450 --> 02:47:01,680
It's awesome and I hope that you guys
spawn a million others and it'll just,

3060
02:47:01,681 --> 02:47:05,490
it continues on. Could have paid for
it. Right? Yeah. I think that really is,

3061
02:47:05,670 --> 02:47:08,190
it sounds so fucking corny and grandiose,

3062
02:47:08,191 --> 02:47:10,140
but I think that really is
the way to change the world.

3063
02:47:10,440 --> 02:47:13,770
The way to change the world is to let
people know how you've changed and then

3064
02:47:13,830 --> 02:47:16,590
that just, it branches out, it ripples.

3065
02:47:16,591 --> 02:47:21,591
It has this massive sort of
snowball effect and it just
grows and if there's any

3066
02:47:22,321 --> 02:47:24,990
way that we can improve our world,

3067
02:47:25,080 --> 02:47:29,820
it's improving the way the other people
around us see it and approach it.

3068
02:47:30,210 --> 02:47:32,970
You know the Ma,
this thing might be ridiculous.

3069
02:47:32,971 --> 02:47:37,080
It might be just one frame and an infinite
movie that goes on forever and that's

3070
02:47:37,110 --> 02:47:39,280
for a lot of people that get,
you know,

3071
02:47:40,110 --> 02:47:42,990
really sad about that and say,
well wow,

3072
02:47:42,991 --> 02:47:44,580
that's so pointless like what's happening?

3073
02:47:45,030 --> 02:47:48,510
But it's happening right now and
I'm enjoying the fuck out of it.

3074
02:47:48,570 --> 02:47:49,650
If it is happening right now,

3075
02:47:49,651 --> 02:47:54,090
if this is really one fucking step in an
infinite number of steps and it's just

3076
02:47:54,091 --> 02:47:57,090
a a life cycle that repeats itself again
and you're going to be a baby again in

3077
02:47:57,091 --> 02:48:01,800
50 years, guess what? I'm having
a great time fuck to do this.

3078
02:48:01,801 --> 02:48:04,530
And if I can figure out a way,
cause some amount of that,

3079
02:48:04,531 --> 02:48:07,260
transfer this energy into my next life,
I'll have that.

3080
02:48:07,290 --> 02:48:09,210
I'll have a great time in that life too.
You know,

3081
02:48:09,211 --> 02:48:12,930
I didn't always have a great time in this
life and I don't know what that's from.

3082
02:48:12,930 --> 02:48:16,680
I don't know. I don't, I don't know if
it's, I dunno if reincarnation is real.

3083
02:48:16,681 --> 02:48:20,190
I don't know if this is a onetime shot
and everything else is just your ego

3084
02:48:20,191 --> 02:48:23,520
trying to protect itself from
the inevitable doom of the, the,

3085
02:48:23,530 --> 02:48:27,180
the spirit which dies just like the
body does. I don't know. I don't know.

3086
02:48:27,240 --> 02:48:29,310
We're all gonna die one
day though, right? Maybe.

3087
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:31,110
I'm not sure that either
we're all going to die.

3088
02:48:31,290 --> 02:48:34,710
I don't even know if that's real.
I'm not convinced this,

3089
02:48:34,711 --> 02:48:38,640
this whole thing might be a fucking
dream within a dream, within a dream.

3090
02:48:38,641 --> 02:48:43,230
But the playstation said wrapped up in
chocolate sauce and pumped into veins

3091
02:48:43,231 --> 02:48:46,970
through the, through a pot cookie that
Brian Red Band and you and your wearing.

3092
02:48:48,090 --> 02:48:51,300
No cookies, no cookies,
nick. But, uh, I think, uh,

3093
02:48:51,420 --> 02:48:54,690
what's made it fun for me is to have
these kinds of conversations. You know,

3094
02:48:54,691 --> 02:48:58,260
it's really made a made life
more enjoyable. And, uh,

3095
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:02,460
I know that you guys are
positively influencing a lot
of people and I know, uh,

3096
02:49:02,610 --> 02:49:06,030
this show is, and all of our friends
are, and I think, uh, that's,

3097
02:49:06,060 --> 02:49:09,090
that's what's up you, I think
that's a, that's that's uh,

3098
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:11,010
something that we've all locked into.

3099
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:14,610
Most of us unexpectedly sorta
stumbled into it, but that's also,

3100
02:49:14,611 --> 02:49:17,070
I think that's the right way it's
supposed to go down. You know,

3101
02:49:17,071 --> 02:49:20,370
the universe has a plan for all
of this and uh, we a little,

3102
02:49:20,860 --> 02:49:25,050
little strange monkeys.
We follow the plan and if you're,

3103
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:28,530
if you're resonating the right frequency,
if you have the right intent,

3104
02:49:28,620 --> 02:49:31,150
I think that plan turns out
the way this one's turning now.

3105
02:49:31,190 --> 02:49:33,930
I think it's good to helping everybody.
It's awesome.

3106
02:49:34,210 --> 02:49:37,310
London real bitches. Thanks
Jackson. What's up? Thanks so much.

3107
02:49:37,311 --> 02:49:41,170
So they can find you guys on
Twitter, London, real TV on Twitter.

3108
02:49:41,171 --> 02:49:43,780
Do you have individual Twitter accounts?
We just role as a team

3109
02:49:45,290 --> 02:49:50,020
and we do. We're like, we bicker
at each other to one of the,

3110
02:49:50,021 --> 02:49:52,770
actually gets married and starts having
kids and then you'll have suffered to

3111
02:49:52,790 --> 02:49:56,350
fucking problems that often.
Does she come in and they'll be like,

3112
02:49:56,710 --> 02:50:00,550
are you really going to podcast
with him again today? God,

3113
02:50:00,551 --> 02:50:04,810
you guys did one a couple of days
ago. No, I don't tolerate that.

3114
02:50:04,811 --> 02:50:08,270
Sun Strong and my household,

3115
02:50:11,190 --> 02:50:14,590
Tarzan, you Jane. That's
our role for life bitches.

3116
02:50:14,620 --> 02:50:18,670
They can't promote the death squad.
November 10th me,

3117
02:50:18,671 --> 02:50:21,550
Brendan Walsh and Tony Hinchcliffe
are coming to Columbus,

3118
02:50:21,551 --> 02:50:25,030
Ohio at the woodlands
tavern at on a brown paper,

3119
02:50:25,031 --> 02:50:28,240
tickets.com to search for a desk wide and
we're going to have a couple more days.

3120
02:50:28,241 --> 02:50:31,630
Anders, the special surprise guests that
I'm not allowed to say he's joining us.

3121
02:50:31,660 --> 02:50:33,700
Oh Shit.
Special surprise guest

3122
02:50:34,020 --> 02:50:38,670
and that is all you can get that
information to. also@desksquad.tv. Brian,

3123
02:50:38,671 --> 02:50:41,760
we'll have that up. We, yes.
Keep people keep asking me,

3124
02:50:41,820 --> 02:50:45,210
when are you going to put together
a website where you have all of the

3125
02:50:45,211 --> 02:50:47,070
information of everybody that's,
you know,

3126
02:50:47,080 --> 02:50:50,370
quote unquote involved in the desk squad,
we're going to do that.

3127
02:50:50,430 --> 02:50:52,950
It's just a matter of time. It's
just a matter of, like I said,

3128
02:50:52,951 --> 02:50:54,540
I have too much shit going on right now.

3129
02:50:54,541 --> 02:50:57,660
Brian is too much shit going on right
now or is somebody else doing it for us?

3130
02:50:57,661 --> 02:51:01,110
Vicky has got the best squad news
where it has all of our tour dates,

3131
02:51:01,170 --> 02:51:05,640
so that's nice as well. We'll say
look. Oh yeah, yeah, it has all of it.

3132
02:51:05,641 --> 02:51:10,410
Like Ari, Bert Kreischer, Brian
Cowen, Ra should fears fear road show.

3133
02:51:10,411 --> 02:51:11,230
That was,

3134
02:51:11,230 --> 02:51:15,980
well, yeah, it just, she hasn't updated
and then last week we got to have someone

3135
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:21,210
to do. This is all when a, the studio
gets constructed and moving in place.

3136
02:51:21,211 --> 02:51:24,870
Brian and I just had some conversations
about it today and the regular weekly

3137
02:51:24,871 --> 02:51:27,030
shows that the ice house,
I talked to Bob today,

3138
02:51:27,031 --> 02:51:30,960
we had a little meeting he brought me in
and one of the things that Bob Fisher,

3139
02:51:30,961 --> 02:51:34,770
the owner of the Ice House wants to
do is have a weekly show here. Uh,

3140
02:51:34,771 --> 02:51:39,300
so I will be at the Ice House
every week that I am in town.

3141
02:51:39,510 --> 02:51:41,130
If I'm not in town.
I want to have a show here,

3142
02:51:41,131 --> 02:51:45,330
but most Wednesdays consider
it done this Wednesday.

3143
02:51:45,450 --> 02:51:47,880
So far it's Joey Diaz.

3144
02:51:48,390 --> 02:51:53,180
Duncan Trussell human probably.
Yeah, probably. Probably Brian. Uh,

3145
02:51:53,181 --> 02:51:57,950

think Ari should fear Irish affairs in

3146
02:51:57,960 --> 02:52:02,310
boom, Ra ship. You're just
texted me. He said I'm in. Boom.

3147
02:52:02,730 --> 02:52:06,970
That's how we roll. Look, it says
boom. It's, he really did say that.

3148
02:52:07,060 --> 02:52:10,480
That's what kind of fucking
psychic energy I'm putting forth.

3149
02:52:10,481 --> 02:52:14,420
Ladies and gentlemen. You see that color?
It's a bit, or you got your textile

3150
02:52:15,970 --> 02:52:19,570

bitches. He's in boom.

And again, those go directly to
support Brian's podcast network.

3156
02:52:40,670 --> 02:52:44,360

to be really fascinating stuff.

3163
02:53:11,310 --> 02:53:13,600
This is going to blow your mind because I,

3164
02:53:13,830 --> 02:53:16,660
I've been listening to several interviews
of her that are already available

3165
02:53:16,661 --> 02:53:19,810
online and this is a one courageous
woman. And uh, this is, uh,

3166
02:53:20,110 --> 02:53:22,060
this is going to be really,
really fascinating.

3167
02:53:22,061 --> 02:53:24,970

my eyes are going and I can't even read

3172
02:53:43,031 --> 02:53:47,410

And it's also got raw cocoa in it,
which is an excellent antioxidant.

3179
02:54:09,010 --> 02:54:11,050
So, uh, that's the schedule for this week.
