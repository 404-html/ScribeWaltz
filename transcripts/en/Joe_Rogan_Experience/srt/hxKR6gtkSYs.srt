00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,050
Hello Freak bitches 30 the last time I
sat a exactly 30 last time I had a three

2
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:07,824
month retreat.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,783
Um,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,690
but he's just got you,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,010
you're unplugging from your life.

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,990
You're saying goodbye to everyone,

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,670
you know,

8
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,040
you know,

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,220
if you,

10
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,491
for all,

11
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:16,380
you know someone's going to
die while you're on retreat.

12
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:21,270
And so there's this real discontinuity
with every project and every aspiration

13
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,800
and everything you have going on.

14
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,143
Um,

15
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,373
and,

16
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,350
and also most of the people in your
life can't believe you're doing this.

17
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:28,541
It's,

18
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,640
there's not much support.

19
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:29,900
You know,

20
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,110
it's like it's just totally inscrutable.

21
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,730
Yeah.

22
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,870
That you would decide to do this and then
you'll essentially lock yourself in a

23
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,321
closet.

24
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:37,491
I mean,

25
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:37,641
a lot.

26
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:39,630
You essentially lock
yourself in a room as big as,

27
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,010
you know,

28
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,010
these two tables and then you're
just left with your thoughts.

29
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,350
And the,

30
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,260
the problem is,

31
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:50,130
is that just thinking itself,

32
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,670
even thinking happy thoughts
is stressful at when you,

33
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,151
when you actually,

34
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,620
when you really start
paying attention to it,

35
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:55,721
that,

36
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,950
that just the sheer
automaticity of it to just,

37
00:00:58,951 --> 00:00:59,761
just to be,

38
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:02,340
just to not be able to
stop the conversation.

39
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,700
And he just can't stop talking
to yourself for a second.

40
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,130
And that now you eventually you can
eventually you become concentrated on,

41
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,470
in this case,

42
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:12,721
uh,

43
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:12,871
the,

44
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,760
the practice I was doing
as it's called Vipassana,

45
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,800
which is mindfulness meditation and the
practice there is just to become very

46
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:21,210
keenly aware of,

47
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,500
uh,

48
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,660
you start with the breath
as an object of meditation.

49
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,080
But,

50
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,610
but once you get a little concentration,

51
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,750
you opened it up to everything.

52
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:32,751
So sounds and sensations and even
thoughts themselves become objects of

53
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:36,810
meditation where you're just noticing
whatever arises in consciousness and,

54
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,800
but the difference between noticing the
thought arise and pass away and being

55
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,030
lost in thought is,

56
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,460
is huge and this is the
all important difference.

57
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,450
And it takes some real
concentration to act,

58
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,310
to see a thought arise and pass away
because without the concentration,

59
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,840
all of a sudden the thoughts just you,

60
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,310
it just comes up from behind
in a way and you are just,

61
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,323
you're just,

62
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,420
you feel identical in,

63
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
in a strange way.

64
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,870
You feel identical to this
sentence in your head.

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,170
You Do,

66
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,010
you feel there's miss thoughts
are just sentences and images.

67
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,401
I mean,

68
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:11,550
it's,

69
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,990
when you actually look
at what a thought is,

70
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:13,111
it's,

71
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:14,640
it's very hard to see how you could,

72
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,460
how could ever define your
subjectivity in the first place.

73
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,490
It's just like mere thoughts are no more
substantial than the sound of my voice.

74
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,380
And you're just hearing the sound of
my voice as a kind of appearance and

75
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,400
consciousness right now.

76
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,563
And it's not,

77
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,340
it's not defining you.

78
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:29,611
It's not,

79
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:30,750
you don't feel identical to it.

80
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,660
It doesn't have a real implication
so much for how you feel.

81
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,883
Uh,

82
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,760
you're,

83
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,593
you're not,

84
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,073
uh,

85
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,050
it's just,

86
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,430
it's easy to see or to in
this case here that it is a,

87
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,410
an just an appearance in consciousness.

88
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,030
It comes and it goes,

89
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:49,170
it starts and it stops.

90
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,180
And it's all sort of in plain view.

91
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,900
But with your own thoughts with
the w w with your own voice,

92
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,610
it,

93
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,130
it sneaks up on you in a way that is,

94
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,040
and even to use

95
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,370
the word you in this case is a
little misleading because it,

96
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:02,760
but it,

97
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,760
it colors consciousness and trims it down
in such a way that it just feels like

98
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,100
you.

99
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,371
It doesn't,

100
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,310
it doesn't feel it does it,

101
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:10,551
it's,

102
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:11,140
it's you,

103
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,973
you feel,

104
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,560
I mean the feeling of being a self,

105
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,090
the feeling that we call I,

106
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,070
the feeling of being an ego in the head
is what it feels like to be thinking

107
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,840
without knowing that you're thinking.

108
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,321
It's the,

109
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:25,900
it's the feeling of this next thought.

110
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,880
Capturing consciousness.

111
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,830
So when you say that thoughts,

112
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,340
you are identical to thought.

113
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:34,090
So if you're thinking something
really fucked up like a,

114
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:34,901
I'm fat,

115
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,800
I'm a loser,

116
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,060
I'm always going to be a loser.

117
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,470
Like that is identical to who you are
because you are sort of framing yourself

118
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,190
in this thought that these thoughts that
you're carrying around in your mind,

119
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,860
they are what's occupying
your consciousness.

120
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,270
And the,

121
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,470
if those thoughts are on the
forefront of your consciousness,

122
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,300
that they identify you,

123
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:52,961
you are,

124
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:56,350
that you are those thoughts and
you are identical to that idea.

125
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:56,861
Yeah.

126
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,191
And their,

127
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,640
and their driving behavior and they're
driving emotion and they're driving each

128
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,710
subsequent train of thought.

129
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,341
So it's,

130
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:03,670
it's just,

131
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,670
it's determining the future expressions
of your consciousness and your body as

132
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:09,791
well.

133
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,330
So you're,

134
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,050
you're,

135
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,381
and again,

136
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm not,

137
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,170
I'm not separating the
mind from the body here.

138
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,004
I mean all of this is,

139
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,250
we could talk about this in terms
of events in the brain as well,

140
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:21,860
but it's much easier to talk about it
in terms of our first person experience

141
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,880
has thoughts and moods and emotions,

142
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:25,300
et cetera.

143
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,010
But,

144
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,770
um,

145
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:26,981
you know,

146
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:27,490
for the,

147
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,690
for the purpose of this argument,

148
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,440
you know,

149
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,930
there's no doubt that
the brain is doing this.

150
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,070
It's just,

151
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,510
we're not that side of the story as
much less to say about that side of the

152
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,320
story at the moment.

153
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,640
And it's not clean is doing it,

154
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,930
but you're,

155
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,190
you're whatever it is,

156
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,001
your personality,

157
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:43,801
your consciousness,

158
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:44,051
your,

159
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:48,010
your center is sort of what guides
the brain one way or another.

160
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,050
Like it is possible to,

161
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:52,060
while in the middle of having
these thoughts and say,

162
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:52,480
you know what,

163
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,020
I'm not gonna entertain these anymore
and I'm going to think about something

164
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:56,500
positive.

165
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,790
But it's very difficult.

166
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,210
Yeah.

167
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,560
Surprisingly difficult.

168
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,070
Even as someone like myself
who's spent a lot of times,

169
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,300
a lot of time meditating,

170
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:06,460
especially a lot of
time in isolation tanks,

171
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,210
I,

172
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,350
it's still difficult every now and then
if something's bothering you to just get

173
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,184
it out of your head.

174
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,060
Like,

175
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,200
especially for me.

176
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,093
Um,

177
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,680
one of my main issues is my work.

178
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,611
Um,

179
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:19,000
like,

180
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,833
uh,

181
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,580
like standup comedy for instance.

182
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,180
Like if I have a show
and a I fuck a bit up.

183
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,350
If it goes wrong,

184
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,500
like if I have two shows in a night
and I fuck a bit up on the first show,

185
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,250
I'm okay.

186
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,780
If I could redo it on the second show,

187
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,740
we're good.

188
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,960
But if I fuck it up on the second show,

189
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,040
God damn it.

190
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,820
Now I have to think about that thing
all night and I'll try to let it go.

191
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,320
I'll try to get it out of my head.

192
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:46,321
But I rationalize it by saying the
only reason why I've gotten so good is

193
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:50,140
because of this crazy obsession
that I have with getting it correct.

194
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,150
And that when things go awry
or when I go down a bad path,

195
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,920
it doesn't quite pan out.

196
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:00,560
And then I have to sort of restart
the whole conversation on stage that,

197
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,880
that uncomfortable moment.

198
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:06,500
And then the subsequent uncomfortable
recollection of that moment is the very

199
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,610
motivation that's led me to be a
good standup in the first place.

200
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,290
So I kind of rationalize it,

201
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,580
but fuck man,

202
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,480
when I'm eating dinner after a show and
I just flubbed one word that fucks up a

203
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:17,960
joke,

204
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,520
I'll be in the middle of
eating pancakes going,

205
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:20,354
shit,

206
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,070
I can't get it out of my head.

207
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:26,750
It doesn't matter if a wonderful wife
and a beautiful family and great friends

208
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,180
and a fantastic job and a
one wonder of just a fee,

209
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,490
a dream life,

210
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,210
it doesn't matter.

211
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,043
I flubbed a word.

212
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,310
You fucking idiot.

213
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:34,551
You know,

214
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,020
like while I'm cutting into my food.

215
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,903
Ah,

216
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,330
well that,

217
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:37,910
that,

218
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,360
that's an interesting moment because,

219
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,173
um,

220
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,130
so there's a moment before
the thought has arisen,

221
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:44,311
right,

222
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:47,280
where you have not yet
remembered the flip lines.

223
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:51,150
So you're just cutting into
your dinner and then it's it,

224
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,010
it's an image or part image,

225
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,390
part sentence,

226
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:54,781
something.

227
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:59,781
There's some expression of thought that
arises in consciousness and you are,

228
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:01,820
you,

229
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,970
you do not,

230
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,620
you do not witness it arise.

231
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,790
It's not like it's a
difference between seeing it,

232
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,490
watching a movie and being
totally lost in the movie.

233
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:14,250
Forgetting that you're sitting in a room
with a bunch of other people looking at

234
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,090
light on a wall.

235
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,391
You're just,

236
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,920
you're totally captured by the movie.

237
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,520
It's different between that and
actually just seeing the screen,

238
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:21,420
the light on the wall,

239
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:22,920
hearing the sound of the projector,

240
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,810
seeing,

241
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,230
seeing,

242
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,730
seeing the artifice and uh,

243
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:31,350
it's possible to see thoughts just as
essentially like a play of light on the

244
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:31,740
wall.

245
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,370
He just use,

246
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,770
you see it before it captures you.

247
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,320
And the difference is total.

248
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:38,640
And it is kind of like,

249
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,780
it's almost like playing a video game
where you can now not get killed in the

250
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:47,130
same spot over and over again.

251
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:51,000
It's like there's like not losing in
the same boss fight over and over again.

252
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:51,750
Yet we,

253
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,620
we lose in that same fight
a thousand times a day.

254
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:58,890
But when you can actually see
thoughts for what they are,

255
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,060
so the next time you flubbed a line and
the next and the next time you recall

256
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:03,894
it,

257
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,480
it's possible with an a,

258
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:05,881
and again,

259
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:08,220
it takes a certain degree of
concentration to be able to do this,

260
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,670
but concentration becomes
kind of a native capacity.

261
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:12,241
At a certain point.

262
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,740
It's like Jujitsu or anything else.

263
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:13,870
I,

264
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,650
you have certain skills and
you don't really lose them.

265
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,923
Um,

266
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,960
then you can just see it and it just
comes and it goes and it doesn't have an

267
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,410
end and it's going,

268
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:25,981
it's going,

269
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:26,910
it's really gone.

270
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:27,141
It's,

271
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:27,241
it's,

272
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,610
and it doesn't have the
same emotional necessity.

273
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:32,250
It doesn't trigger the same mental state.

274
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:37,251
And now that's not to say that these
negative mental states haven't had the,

275
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,720
the benefit that you ascribe to them.

276
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:43,081
So yeah,

277
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:46,860
it could be that you are as good as you
are because you were motivated to not

278
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:49,710
embarrass yourself ever again
because it felt so terrible.

279
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,041
Right?

280
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,050
So you hated this experience
of flubbing align.

281
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,480
You hated the memory of,

282
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:54,120
of,

283
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,620
of,

284
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,220
and the of it the next day

285
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,360
you hated what it did to your,

286
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,160
your time with your family.

287
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,001
And so he thought,

288
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,860
I'm not even the next tour.

289
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:02,730
I'm going to get this.

290
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,151
I'm going to,

291
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,050
I'm going to get up earlier.

292
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:04,980
I'm going to work harder,

293
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,263
et cetera.

294
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,931
So yeah,

295
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:07,111
that,

296
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:07,311
that,

297
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:08,130
that's all part of the,

298
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,290
the clockwork that's causing you to,

299
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,880
to hone your craft.

300
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,253
Um,

301
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,400
but I would argue that a little
mental suffering goes along way.

302
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,234
I think we w you know,

303
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,330
nine times out of 10 or
99 times out of a hundred,

304
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,440
we suffer unnecessarily and
there's no good comes from it.

305
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:25,861
It's just,

306
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:25,931
it's,

307
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:27,630
it's not actually making us better people.

308
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:28,650
It's making us more neurotic.

309
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,910
People were more worried.

310
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,811
We're worse.

311
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,670
Husbands were worse fathers and,

312
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,560
and it's time to,

313
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,500
to break that spell and,

314
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:36,920
and,

315
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,441
and then you can,

316
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,330
you can selectively be as,

317
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,110
as uptight and neurotic as you want,

318
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,080
but you can,

319
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,250
it gives you a kind of
freedom to pick your,

320
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,851
your,

321
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,570
um,

322
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,530
your priorities in a way rather than
be captured by just whatever the next

323
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,610
thought happens to be.

324
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,010
I've also found for me personally,

325
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,910
the discipline and diligence or the,

326
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,360
the best mitigating factors for
dealing with a neurotic thoughts.

327
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,800
Like if I have an issue,

328
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,873
um,

329
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,120
one of the big issues if I've ever had
anything go wrong was that I didn't work

330
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:12,030
hard enough.

331
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,780
So if I know for a fact that
I worked as hard as I could,

332
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,010
like back when I was competing,

333
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:18,030
that was a huge issue.

334
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,441
And it also,

335
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:19,610
uh,

336
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,730
mitigated nervousness.

337
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,020
Cause Look,

338
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,400
whenever you're involved in a competition
as terrifying as a full contact

339
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:30,810
martial arts tournament where
concussions are not just likely,

340
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:33,090
but it's someone in,

341
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,650
there's a hundred people
fighting in this tournament,

342
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:35,730
someone's going to sleep,

343
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,190
someone's going to get knocked out
because it going to be you and someone's

344
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,120
going to get their nose broken.

345
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:39,954
Someone's going to get hit.

346
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,240
A lot of people are probably,

347
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,823
if I,

348
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,950
if I trained really hard,

349
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,730
if like I know I did
everything that I could,

350
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,600
I ate right,

351
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,620
I slept right.

352
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,180
I put in all the practice,

353
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,680
I worked on all my weaknesses.

354
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:52,841
I,

355
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:53,041
I,

356
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,521
you know,

357
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,590
I didn't neglect my strengths.

358
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,030
I was much less nervous,

359
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,990
much less nervous and much
better at dealing with losses.

360
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,430
Whereas losses,

361
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,850
uh,

362
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,560
I think losses for martial artists
can be insanely devastating.

363
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,370
Like A,

364
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,830
I was listening to this
interview with Travis Brown,

365
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,101
you know,

366
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,690
he has no UFC heavyweight,

367
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,380
one of the top,

368
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,670
top five guys in the world,

369
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,850
great fighter lost recently
to Fabricio for doom.

370
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,470
Okay.

371
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,860
Any title elimination fight.

372
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,370
So Fabrisio has gone on
and he'll be fighting Cain
Velasquez for the heavyweight

373
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:23,671
title.

374
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:28,671
Now in October in Mexico and
a huge October or November,

375
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,250
November,

376
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,060
believe it's November.

377
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,930
What are one of those?

378
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,620
Um,

379
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,350
he's fighting a Cain
Velasquez for the title.

380
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,130
Huge fight.

381
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,150
It could've been Travis Browne,

382
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,510
Travis Browne lost the fight
by decision and you know,

383
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:39,721
it was,

384
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:40,010
uh,

385
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,351
it was,

386
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:41,760
he lost without a doubt.

387
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,080
But you know,

388
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,310
wasn't embarrassing.

389
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,361
It wasn't a,

390
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:46,890
he didn't get knocked
out in the first round.

391
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:48,300
He didn't get submitted really quickly,

392
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,170
but he did lose the fight and it
was apparently devastating to him.

393
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:52,621
I mean,

394
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:54,130
he's in great depth

395
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,190
about lying in bed in the
fetal position crying.

396
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,550
I mean his fucking 250 pound gladiator
and he's curled up in a fetal position

397
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,783
crying.

398
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,280
I mean,

399
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,150
the truth is I have to,

400
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:07,540
the ego is always curled up
in the fetal position crying.

401
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,730
We all have that

402
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,180
part of ourselves and it's,

403
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:13,990
um,

404
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,201
yeah,

405
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:14,690
I mean that,

406
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,150
and that's what is so excruciating about
the self and the self really is the

407
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,430
center of the center of our problem.

408
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:21,701
You know,

409
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:21,931
and,

410
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:24,880
and when things are really going well,

411
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,140
we are consoled by how well they're going.

412
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:30,040
But we know it's,

413
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,240
it's vulnerable to change.

414
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:31,361
I mean,

415
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:33,940
you're only as good as your
last appearance in some sense.

416
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:34,091
I mean,

417
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:38,350
I could do something
incredibly embarrassing in the
middle of this podcast and

418
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:41,110
that will be the thing I'm
thinking about tonight.

419
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:41,921
And I'll be,

420
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:42,401
I'm thinking,

421
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:42,700
you know,

422
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:42,911
God,

423
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:45,470
I can't believe I fucked that
up so bad and Joe's podcast.

424
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,653
Uh,

425
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,730
and that it's,

426
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,010
you're always vulnerable to
that for the recipe for it.

427
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:51,844
As long as you,

428
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,130
as long as you're in the
center of this thing,

429
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:57,310
vulnerable to what other other
people think about you and,

430
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,613
um,

431
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,910
a captive of your really
crazy rehearsal of experience.

432
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:04,181
And when you,

433
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:05,410
when something like this happens to you,

434
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,520
just think of how many times
you repeat it to yourself.

435
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:14,521
It's like you tell yourself the same
story 15 times a minute for hours and it

436
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:18,790
doesn't strike you as insane,

437
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,170
but it actually is insane.

438
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:20,321
It's,

439
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:20,420
I,

440
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,253
if you're,

441
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,080
if you are thoughts could be broadcast
on a monitor for other people to hear and

442
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:30,130
they could hear you repeat yourself
over and over and over again.

443
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,440
It would seem starkly crazy.

444
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,390
It just it and yet it seems normal.

445
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,610
It's,

446
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,290
it's kind of like,

447
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,050
like the dream state where you go to
sleep and you're in your bed and you,

448
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:40,980
you know,

449
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,410
you're,

450
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,940
everything's obeying the laws of physics.

451
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,930
And then in the next
conscious moment you are,

452
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:47,561
you know,

453
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,880
at a party somewhere,

454
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:50,440
it's talking to someone who you know,

455
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:51,340
is dead and saying,

456
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:51,431
oh,

457
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,160
I can't believe you're,

458
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,050
you're alive now.

459
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:53,171
And,

460
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:53,780
and,

461
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,640
and then you know,

462
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,050
there's a gorilla in the room and,

463
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,800
and,

464
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,980
and none of this strikes you as crazy.

465
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's the craziest things about dreams is
that the mind seems to just accept them

466
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,970
except these changes one after
the other without any sense.

467
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:12,690
That there should be
continuity and this is due.

468
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,990
There's no question that this is due to
the diminished activity of the frontal

469
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:18,850
lobes dirt during rem
sleep and that we just,

470
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,830
our truth or reality testing hardware
has come largely offline during dreams.

471
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:29,260
But there's something analogous happening
when we're just thinking in the waking

472
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:31,030
state because thoughts are,

473
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,420
thoughts don't make
much sense because the,

474
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,940
the repetition is we don't notice
how crazy the repetition is.

475
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,640
And we would notice it if we
were talking to each other.

476
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,500
If I was telling you the same
thing 15 times in a row without a,

477
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,170
without honoring your expectation
that I might move on to another topic,

478
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:47,810
you know,

479
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,190
you would,

480
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,600
you would notice and I would notice.

481
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:50,230
Right?

482
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,063
Um,

483
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,450
and uh,

484
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,951
yeah.

485
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:55,031
And,

486
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:59,200
and the other thing that's crazy about
thoughts is that much of our thinking and

487
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:00,560
certainly our linguistic thoughts,

488
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,500
or it's structured as though it were a
conversation and we played both sides of

489
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,250
the conversation.

490
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,971
So I,

491
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:08,181
you know,

492
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:08,450
I'll,

493
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,910
I'll sit down here and,

494
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:11,330
um,

495
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:11,480
you know,

496
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,350
I said I came in,

497
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,520
I sat down and,

498
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,433
uh,

499
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,290
I brought you a book and I wanted to sign
the book and I see this pen over here

500
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:18,391
and,

501
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:19,760
and I think,

502
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,211
Oh,

503
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:20,361
good.

504
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:22,160
There's a pen over there right now.

505
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,530
I can see that there's a pen over there.

506
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,460
So who am I?

507
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,770
Why do I have to say
there's a pen over there,

508
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:27,990
right?

509
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,640
Who am I telling?

510
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,100
Is there someone in me who can't
see that there's a pen over there?

511
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,761
Right?

512
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,250
So there's a conversation
that started like,

513
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,490
and I'm both sides of it,

514
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,290
that doesn't make any sense.

515
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,531
Right?

516
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:36,611
And,

517
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:37,780
and yet we are,

518
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,310
our subjectivity is continually,

519
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,663
uh,

520
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:42,810
just,

521
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,643
it is,

522
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,620
it is discursive in that way and they're
just voices talking to each other.

523
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,650
And there's not only,

524
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,120
not only are there not
to have us in there,

525
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:54,440
there's not even one of us in there.

526
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:54,741
There's not,

527
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:55,940
the thinker isn't there,

528
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,560
but we seem to have two of them.

529
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,600
It's like we're constantly
talking to mommy and Daddy.

530
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,441
Uh,

531
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,570
and in fact,

532
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:06,020
I could be the way this
conversation gets internalized,

533
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:06,351
cause you know,

534
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:09,590
I can see it in my kids now
where they seem to all the Aleve,

535
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:10,060
you know,

536
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,330
I'll listen to my daughter or playing
by herself and she's talking to herself

537
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,710
out loud in the way that,

538
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,251
that,

539
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:16,521
you know,

540
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:18,440
you'd have to be sort of
crazy to do as an adult.

541
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,981
But as a kid,

542
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:19,341
you're just,

543
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:19,611
you know,

544
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,690
you're just talking out loud.

545
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,530
Um,

546
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,340
and eventually we all learned to
internalize that conversation.

547
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,540
But,

548
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,373
um,

549
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,071
and when you don't,

550
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:29,510
when people who can't internalize it will,

551
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:30,290
they're the crazy ones.

552
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,441
You know,

553
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:30,651
the,

554
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:33,750
the person who's walking
down the street just saying,

555
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:34,041
oh good,

556
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,710
there's a pen over there and what w God,

557
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,351
we're late.

558
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,651
And,

559
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:37,484
uh,

560
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:37,881
God,

561
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:39,800
I know Joe Joe is gonna really be pissed.

562
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,610
Um,

563
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,800
I can't believe I sh I should have
checked the traffic before I left.

564
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,460
So these are the kinds of thoughts
I could think silently in,

565
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:46,681
in,

566
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:48,170
in the space of my mind.

567
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,890
But,

568
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,700
um,

569
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,110
and it wouldn't be starkly crazy,

570
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,120
but to verbalize them
then you're a madman.

571
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,870
And that,

572
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,400
that difference between letting them
out and just knowing to keep your mouth

573
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,790
shut is it captures a,

574
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
a large part of the
difference between being,

575
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,060
you know,

576
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,490
uh,

577
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,530
a proper lunatic,

578
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,280
uh,

579
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,480
and in normal person.

580
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,740
But what I argue in this book is
that it's normal isn't good enough.

581
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,221
You know,

582
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:13,910
the normal,

583
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,910
the normal state of consciousness wherein
you are just chased out of bed every

584
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:21,920
morning by your thoughts and you think,

585
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:22,131
think,

586
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:22,311
think,

587
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:22,491
think,

588
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:26,090
think every waking moment until you
fall helplessly asleep at night.

589
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,493
Um,

590
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,320
that's not necessarily
a happy place to be.

591
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:31,910
And it's not the only alternative.

592
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,280
And,

593
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,113
and so,

594
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,363
um,

595
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,060
and again,

596
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,380
and thought it's not that you're,

597
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,020
the goal is not to have
a mind without thoughts,

598
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,580
but we need thoughts and you can't,

599
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:40,701
you know,

600
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:45,701
everything we do as human beings for the
most part d requires thought to get off

601
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:47,721
the ground.

602
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:52,380
So our relationships are based on thoughts
and our every public institution and

603
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:52,960
science.

604
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,670
It's all,

605
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,670
it's this conversation we have with
ourselves and with others is based on,

606
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,500
on language,

607
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,160
uh,

608
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,850
almost an a and a and concepts
that are mediated by language.

609
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,683
And,

610
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,553
uh,

611
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,240
so you need thought.

612
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,270
But the difference is the difference is
between thinking and knowing that you're

613
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:20,940
thinking in really knowing that you're
thinking in the moment of thoughts

614
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:22,980
arising or being lost in thought.

615
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,360
And then when you're lost in thought,

616
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,290
it doesn't really matter
what the content is.

617
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,530
You're still confused
about who and what you are.

618
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,890
I mean,

619
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,680
you gotta be thinking about then what
you can be thinking about the most

620
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,720
profound things in science or in,

621
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,030
in ethics or whatever it is.

622
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,780
But if you're just thinking
without knowing that you're
thinking there is a kind

623
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:43,501
of delusion there,

624
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:46,590
it is analogous to the dream
state in a way where you're just,

625
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,760
you're not,

626
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,000
it's not clear to you
what's going on youth,

627
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,400
the youth that you think you
are the thinker of the thoughts,

628
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:55,950
you think you're offering your
thoughts in a way that's you're,

629
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,001
you're not,

630
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:57,151
I mean,

631
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,590
cause thoughts just arrives.

632
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,011
We don't,

633
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,120
we don't actually offer them

634
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,440
[inaudible]

635
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,110
yeah.
