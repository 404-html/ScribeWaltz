1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,130
Fuck,
yes,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,340
dude,
I love the video that Tommy made.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,020
Oh,
Tommy's the fucking animation gotta.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,760
Go check out Tommy's animation button.
Motherfucker.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,110
Where is it at now and where can you go?
Where can you get that animation or todd

6
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,640
guarantee on Tom's instagram?
Is it available?

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,200
I paid for that.
I know he did pay me this thing.

8
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:23,770
It's amazing.
He showed it to me last night,

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,830
the ice house.
It's fucking amazing.

10
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:28,160
So whoever did that is really talented.
It's very funny.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,200
His fans are the most creative fans ever
did.

12
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:36,201
He's got fans in Indonesia who teach 
English to children and all they do is 

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,240
teach them how to say Bertus fat and 
jeans and jeans.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,050
Jeans,
high and tight.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,150
Oh,
so strange.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,240
He's kind of weird.
Niche like him and his wife together on 

17
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,961
that podcast.
It's a weird like silly show we should 

18
00:00:56,961 --> 00:01:01,641
have for the six of us should go out to 
eat one night because watching the two 

19
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:01,641
of them interact is there.

20
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:06,640
It's just inside jokes between the two 
of them always and it's so much fun to 

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,891
be.
There really are one of the funnest 

22
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:09,891
couples that I've ever befriended in my 
life.

23
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:13,850
It's weird that it works so good.
It's like every comedian couple when 

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,580
they're two comedians.
How long?

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,580
It's like a bomb,
like you just standing next to it.

26
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,620
Like I got to get out of here before 
this thing blows,

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,540
but with them it's like it just works.
He's.

28
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,610
It's so funny too because he's known me 
probably 15 years and the other day 

29
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,970
we're hanging out.
There's just me and him bullshit.

30
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,770
And he goes,
he's got two kids.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,940
He's,
you could their house,

32
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,620
you can tell they have two brand new 
kids.

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Ellis is running around like a lunatic 
with a balloon running into walls that 

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,010
kids are wrecking ball.
The other one's an infant and he looks 

35
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,010
at me.

36
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,040
He goes,
I can't believe you did this with no 

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,040
money.
Kids.

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,800
Fuck it.
A little workout.

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,420
Wow.
Yeah,

40
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,200
that's true.
Right.

41
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,090
How old were you when you first started 
having kids?

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,240
Thirty two.
I think my daughter's 14.

43
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,580
And how long into comedy where you then?
Oh,

44
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:59,910
like I started at 26,
so eight years.

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,740
Wow.
Maybe.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,850
Yeah.
Eight years,

47
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:07,851
probably six years.
Someone who could do the math better 

48
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:07,851
than me.
Yeah,

49
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,630
so at six years and that is not a good 
time as a comedian.

50
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:12,990
Six years in is rough.
I was featuring,

51
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,050
Georgia was born on like on like a 
Tuesday and I had and we induced labor 

52
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,540
so that I could go feature for Dave 
attell on Thursday.

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,960
Oh my God.
And I was so excited to work with David.

54
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,330
Tell it was almost as excited to work 
with David.

55
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:31,230
Tells the advocate.
Where were you working?

56
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,230
A Miami.
I worked at that stretch.

57
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,010
That a terrible place to work.
Yeah,

58
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,020
no shit dude.
I was just in Miami.

59
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:47,091
I was in Miami a few months ago and I 
did that cell phone bag thing because I 

60
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:50,271
did it before I fill my netflix special.
I did it for awhile where they didn't 

61
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,480
have to put their phones in the bag.
Then I stopped doing it.

62
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,130
It's just,
it's complicated.

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,360
It's annoying.
It takes.

64
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,480
Especially when you're doing two shows,
it's a giant space in between them,

65
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:00,010
but never have I seen a crowd like

66
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,020
cause you to use your phone.
You've got to get out of the arena and 

67
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,681
then come back.
Everybody was just constantly going out 

68
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:08,530
there.
We're constantly getting up.

69
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,740
I mean it was just,
it was like I was doing standup not in 

70
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,060
front of people sitting down in front of
people in a constant state of moving,

71
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,600
sitting down and getting up.
That's fucking insane.

72
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,570
Just constantly moving like no place 
I've ever been.

73
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,940
They have zero attention span.
I've always said,

74
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,400
if you want to starve to death,
open up a bookstore in Miami,

75
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,790
a piece,
motherfuckers,

76
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,400
they just do coke and fuck each other 
and party.

77
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,690
Not Everybody.
I know.

78
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm generalizing.
If you'll look bro.

79
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:40,000
I read Billy Corbin loves fucking Miami,
so

80
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,850
bro,
I.

81
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,910
So I started headlining.
Miami was one of the first clubs that 

82
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,241
let me head.
I had handled the room that just like 

83
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:49,560
take a white guy and he got anyone.
Dude I had.

84
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,120
I had the most crazy experiences I've 
ever had there.

85
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,240
One night it's me and two other comics.
I'm headlining right Sunday night and I 

86
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:01,220
say to the manager,
I said,

87
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:03,800
it seems pretty rowdy.
Or they heckling her and then was like,

88
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:04,370
yeah,
it's pretty bad.

89
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,860
There's gang bangers in the front row.
I was like,

90
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,840
who can we escort them out?
Maybe he goes,

91
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,850
I think they have weapons.
I'm not comfortable with that.

92
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,440
I was like,
so what are we going to do?

93
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:13,760
And he's like,
I don't know how to tread lightly.

94
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:18,761
I guess feature girl at goes up,
there's a hundred percent swear on my 

95
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,060
children's story feature that goes up.

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,710
They destroy him,
he comes back,

97
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,940
oh my God.
Thinning hair,

98
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:26,240
matted sweaty to his head and he's like,
it's not good.

99
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,380
So I go out and I do an old Dave attell 
trick.

100
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:30,950
It's,
it's,

101
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:35,951
I mean it's a comedy trick,
but I watched dave do it where he would 

102
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:36,710
ask the audience a question that he had 
the joke for.

103
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,010
So he asked them to set up,
what's the best way to please your wife,

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,300
you know?
And then he had the joke,

105
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,340
what's the best way to give oral sex to 
your chick?

106
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:45,470
And the guy's like.
And then the guy would tell his joke and

107
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:46,550
then obviously you have the better 
jokes.

108
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:47,970
You wrote it like,
oh no,

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,760
what you do is you put your lips around 
her entirely and go,

110
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,630
whoa.
And so I do that with these gang bangers

111
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,690
for like 40,
35 minutes and it's killing the whole 

112
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:58,690
crowd's like finally we're all having 
fun.

113
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,610
I look off to the left and all of a 
sudden one of them are darker,

114
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:05,190
Guy Name's Ray,
gets up on stage and he was like,

115
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,240
on stage,
there was no stopping this with you with

116
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,220
me so I can use a real motherfucker 
right here.

117
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,700
Who's a real mother fucker.
You know what real motherfuckers getting

118
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:18,701
the 305 pulls his pants down and shows 
his deck and it is massive,

119
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,240
massive and dark like.
And everyone's silent.

120
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:23,810
I'm like,
okay,

121
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:26,300
right,
thank you very much.

122
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:27,090
He was like,
show Yo Shit.

123
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:32,091
So I'm like,
not now show Yo shit son show Yo shit 

124
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:32,091

I was like,

125
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,790
not gonna happen now.
Not going to happen now I,

126
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,750
you know,
you might want to leave.

127
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm sure they're calling the cops and 
he's like,

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,550
good looking out and he leaves,
right?

129
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,470
So I'm like,

130
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,810
I have nothing to say.
I have nothing to say.

131
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,190
I'm like,
I'm like,

132
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:47,690
how do I follow that?
All of a sudden,

133
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,780
lighter skinned dude face tattooed 
dreadlocks stands up real slow and I'm 

134
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:52,780
like,

138
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,880
an equally almost like lighter to tone 
Dick,

139
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:09,140
like a purple ring around the lake and 
the place is going bananas.

140
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,100
They're like,
oh my God.

141
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,090
Oh my God.

144
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,670
ray and get a ride home.
Thank you so much for the.

145
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,750
No,

146
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,500
Looking out.
Good.

147
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,830
Looking out.
He gets off stage,

148
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,260

I said,

149
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,160
Joe,
I swear on my children's lives.

150
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,220
I swear on my children's lives.
They're there with a hairless albino 

151
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,140
girl or guy guy.
And I go,

152
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:41,170
so funny man.
The only Dick I ever wanted to see was 

153
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,830
yours and the audience quiet.
He slowly stands up and everyone's like,

154
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:43,600
no,
please don't have him.

155
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,610
Gets on stage,
drops his pants and it is huge.

156
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,350
No hair.
It looks like a lighthouse.

157
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,380
Just I just dropped the mic because 
that's my show and I just walk off 

158
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,500
stage.
It was the FA that will.

159
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,730
That club was fun,

160
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,920
insane,
insane.

161
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,430
You know what happened?
They started giving out free tickets and

162
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,450
just went off the charts like no one was
paying and it was all just like young 

163
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,270
kids.
And I remember I had a joke once where I

164
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:13,380
said something about I think Oscar de la
Hoya.

165
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:15,650
It was like a joke about boxing,
about like,

166
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,640
you know,
taking a left hook from Oscar de la Hoya

167
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,770
and someone yells out,
fuck him,

168
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,360
fuck him,
Fernando Vargas.

169
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:22,650
And then somebody goes,
fuck him.

170
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,680
So Chavez.
And they just started fucking debating 

171
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
about what my guys,
this is a joke,

172
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,860
has nothing to do with boxing even what 
the fuck.

173
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,040
But it turned into this like gigantic 
argument over which Latino boxer is 

174
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,450
better.
Oh,

175
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,120
craziness.
I've never been to a club that was more 

176
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,090
out of control and I saw it get out of 
control because when I first started 

177
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,910
working there it was fine,
it was fine,

178
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,420
and then somewhere along the line it 
just went to chaos.

179
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,630
They started doing just rowdy and ratty 
or acts that getting more and more young

180
00:07:56,941 --> 00:08:01,941
kids.
And then sometimes you'd go there and 

181
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:01,941
the whole audience you'd be like 18.

182
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:02,150
Oh yeah.
And,

183
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,920
and,
and not everyone spoke English.

184
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,540
That was another real problem in that 
club.

185
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,210
You never saw anybody kill like you see 
diaz do spanglish in front of those 

186
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,750
fucking people.

187
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,870
Oh my God.
Because he came up in that club while he

188
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:17,120
was always there.
I think him and ricky,

189
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,510
ricky crews,
all those guys had all worked at club 

190
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,980
and just wore job at Joey murmured or

191
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,010
Bert.
I'd worked with Joey there a ton of 

192
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,010
times,
but you know,

193
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,820
Joey and I,
we knew how to work together like it 

194
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:33,820
worked and I'm,
you know,

195
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,170
from doing the comedy store so much.
I'm just used to chaos and then you get 

196
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,180
used to chaos.
I liked it.

197
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,640
Yeah,
it's fun,

198
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,700
it's fun sometimes you know,
as long as you're not filming a special 

199
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,910
place.
It was just a shell.

200
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:49,250
It's just a show and it's chaos.
It's fun.

201
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,440
That was my first taping and Philly 
philly's wild ass place to I I call it 

202
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,490
called Tommy.
He goes,

203
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:58,290
that's why we taped to brother.
Have good,

204
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,520
good luck on the next one.

205
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,580
Yeah,
I take for now.

206
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:02,870
I do.
I do for now.

207
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,850
Dude.
That is genius.

208
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,980
So way to do it.
I really should do six.

209
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,040
Chappelle did nine.
Just the way to go.

210
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,250
It seems like it's not,
but the thing is like you want to make 

211
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,281
it the most like a regular show,
but the ironic thing is most of what I 

212
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:21,851
use I use from the first show because 
I'm so loose because I know I have four 

213
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:22,850
shows.
It's like it's different.

214
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,540
It's,
it's,

215
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,360
it's when you're,
when you film in one show,

216
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,540
like always remember seeing a bill 
Hicks.

217
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,780
Relentless,
which is the one he did in the UK,

218
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,580
is a big theater in the UK and it's a.
yeah,

219
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,490
giant production.
He comes out to like a Jimi Hendrix song

220
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:45,491
and his fire behind them and all this 
shit and you could feel the tension,

221
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,110
like he's got tension because he's got 
one shot at this and he did a great job,

222
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,490
but it was stiff.

223
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,820
It's just stiff and like I was dating 
this girl at the time.

224
00:09:55,821 --> 00:10:00,821
She's very smart.
It had washed it with her and she's 

225
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:01,700
like,
he's interesting,

226
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,220
but this is not funny.
The way she said that.

227
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:05,060
I was like,
wow.

228
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,760
Like I was a giant Bill Hicks van.
I was like hurt.

229
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,440
I was like,
I wanted to argue with her,

230
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:14,441
but I was like,
I can't argue with her because she's 

231
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:14,441
kind of right.
It wasn't.

232
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:18,910
I didn't laugh when I was such a fan 
that like watching him was important to 

233
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:23,921
me early on wanting to watch it,
like because I felt like he was a very 

234
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:25,190
important figure in comedy even though 
rh fear shits on them relentlessly,

235
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,120
but I was.
When I was watching him,

236
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,760
he's an animal,
but when I was watching them I was 

237
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,660
thinking she's right.
It's not really making me laugh at all,

238
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,530
but I know the materials well thought 
out and it's very good.

239
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,920
But um,
it's just that.

240
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,220
And I recognized that one show thing.
You're filming one show.

241
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:47,240
You got one shot at it.

242
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,250
See I,
I think because I come from a,

243
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,630
like a baseball sports background,
I like having pressure on me.

244
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:59,631
I love that feeling of you got one shot 
so affiliated to and the first one it 

245
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:04,851
rained,
the generator went out and we had to 

246
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:04,851
hold the audience in the rain for an 
hour and a half.

247
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:07,530
Oh Geez.
They lost their buzz right there.

248
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:12,531
Soaking wet.
They finally come into the show in the 

249
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:13,200
show that they're trying to catch a buzz
again.

250
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,480
And it was a bad show.
Like legit,

251
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:17,490
like legit.
I didn't even do well.

252
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,870
Like I remember telling my buddy,
Tony,

253
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:20,070
who produced it.
I go,

254
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,350
well,
I've got bad shows where like when 

255
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,350
you're moving,
you're accidentally stand on the mic and

256
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,500
you would go to move and then the mic 
moves away from your mouth.

257
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,490
And I did it.
I bugging you will it into existence.

258
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,780
I told my wife who was there I go,
if I flub a word like a,

259
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,350
just write it down so I can pick it up 
clean.

260
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:37,620
And the second one,
she walked into the green room.

261
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,420
All my agents,
all my managers,

262
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,930
producers with a notepad and goes,
I don't even know where to start.

263
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,930
So I get.
So I go,

264
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:50,931
I got one more shot.
I got one shot and in my head I have 

265
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:51,150
that highschool.
Bert Kreischer,

266
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,350
the like you said,
you like pressure,

267
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:55,740
let's go motherfucker.
You got one show like it's awesome.

268
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,790
I'm getting chills talking about going,
let's go.

269
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,790
You're not fucking up one word.
You're having to show your fucking life.

270
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,470
My Buddy Tony Hernandez,
who produced it,

271
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:07,471
comes over and he goes,
let's get a coffee and back in high 

272
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:07,471
school have been like bumpy coke.
But it was like,

273
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:07,750
let's get a coffee.

274
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,220
We're grown ups,
had a coffee,

275
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,690
went on,
and Joe,

276
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:14,320
I swear to God on the best show of my 
life,

277
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,720
the best show of my life to the point 
where I was like,

278
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,290
I even,
I fucked around a little bit on stage 

279
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:22,290
and I just kept it in the special.
I was like,

280
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,590
and I think if I did nine,
they'd be sloppy.

281
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,270
If I do too,
and I go,

282
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:29,290
fuck,
I got one shot.

283
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,350
I got a guy got again this tonight.
See what you're saying.

284
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,880
I feel like you really go.
This is important to me.

285
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,050
I mean,
I'd love to do it

286
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,150
four,
I think.

287
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,040
Yeah,
I think you do as many as you want.

288
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,070
Honestly.
You know it's sits as a matter of like 

289
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,650
that,
that pressure of that second show if the

290
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:48,651
first show.
I think that's what I was talking about 

291
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:49,800
this with a chuck Palahniuk yesterday.
Did I say his name right?

292
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,200
Yeah,

293
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,810
for sure.
Paula,

294
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,590
Paula Palenik,
politic bar,

295
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,610
like terrible moments on stage.
I think you like the best thing ever for

296
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:03,460
your act like eating shit,
eating shit.

297
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:06,370
The best thing ever for your.
Because then you recover from that,

298
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:06,760
you're like,
Ooh,

299
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,060
I don't want to feel that again ever.
I not feeling too.

300
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,570
It's the worst and you bounced back.
You figure out how to,

301
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,630
how to tighten everything up.
You figured out how to just even a bad 

302
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:18,640
moment,
a joke that doesn't work,

303
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,490
you know,
like jokes that don't worry.

304
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,000
I've got some new stuff,
man,

305
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:27,001
that is just not that good with some new
stuff that's just like it's in its 

306
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,460
infant stage where it's just like 
wobbling around every now and then I'll 

307
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:32,460
catch it,
I'll catch it.

308
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,231
Perfect.
And I've only been doing some of them 

309
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:37,231
for like two or three shows,
you know,

310
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:40,420
so they like wobbly that I don't know 
where I'm going with them and I'm trying

311
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:42,490
to figure it out on stage and fuck 
around with them.

312
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:45,670
That's the whole purpose of doing all 
these shows in town especially.

313
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,200
And,
but those,

314
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,410
those haunt you and the ride home,
you're like,

315
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,920
that's why.
That's why I'm grateful I worked at the 

316
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:58,920
store.
Oh yeah,

317
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,200
right before I did my special,
my closing.

318
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,450
But I do on the show on the special.
The closing bit,

319
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,900
I uh,
I sat with you for a fucking hour in the

320
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:09,901
back room because I took it up in the 
main room following like Dalea and I 

321
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:10,180
just said,
we're here we go,

322
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,770
and I,
man,

323
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,240
that club can really let you know where 
the silences and you go,

324
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:18,100
all right.
And then you're like,

325
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,180
oh,
I've been lazy.

326
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:22,220
I've been performing to fans who will 
give you the benefit of the doubt.

327
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:22,900
Love you.
Yeah.

328
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,430
Yeah.
And they want you to succeed,

329
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,890
but when you do a Netflix special,
you need it to be.

330
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:31,891
The strangers need to like it.
That's the old louis quote that I used 

331
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:33,070
to hang my hat on.
They were like,

332
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,560
why don't you work at UCB?
And he goes,

333
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,400
anyone can make them laugh.
He was like,

334
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:37,550
I'm famous gay.
They've,

335
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,670
I go in like,
that's like making your friends laugh.

336
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,240
That's why this is why I do the road is 
the art form is to make strangers laugh.

337
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,500
And I was like,
yeah,

338
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:47,110
it is to make strangers laugh.
Yeah.

339
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,340
Well it's also,
you don't want a delusional perspective.

340
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,010
And one

341
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,890
thing that does happen to some complex 
stan hope lives by it.

342
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:59,891
Like he's like,
why would I go and do someone else's 

343
00:14:59,891 --> 00:14:59,891
audience?
He goes,

344
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:00,920
it took me 25 years to make my own 
audience.

345
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,090
I'm like,
okay,

346
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,300
I get it,
but I really feel like to develop 

347
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,481
material to really do it right,
you got to do it in front of just 

348
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:13,781
regular people,
people that aren't necessarily there to 

349
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,001
see you.
And the beautiful thing about the 

350
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:16,001
stores,
if there's 15 people in the lineup or 20

351
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:16,001
people in the lineup,
whatever it is,

352
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,070
how many others see you?
Ten percent,

353
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,810
30 percent,
20 percent.

354
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,690
Like,
you know,

355
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,410
maybe they're there to see you and Talia
and also,

356
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,390
you know,
tom and also Christina,

357
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,670
like it's there,
just comedy fans,

358
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,240
crusher fans.
Yeah,

359
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,160
yeah.
That,

360
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,340
that's giant as jarring because those 
guys,

361
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:39,341
they like develop like that.
I've seen a few people that develop an 

362
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:42,671
audience and that's all their audience 
and they just get real complacent,

363
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,000
real lazy.

364
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,190
The um,
I mean,

365
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,940
I've,
I've,

366
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,430
I say lightly because there's some 
internet comics,

367
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,940
meaning like youtube comment,
people that do comedy now.

368
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,640
And some are good,
some are good and some are developing.

369
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:57,530
I don't know,
I was just saying that to be polite,

370
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,480
but like.
But that one guy,

371
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:02,690
he got booed off stage in Montreal 
because he's been performing to fan.

372
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Oh,
well here's the other thing about that 

373
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:07,960
guy.
That guy goes up on a show where there's

374
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,880
all these other comedians on and then at
the end of his set says that comedy 

375
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,730
shouldn't be about about preaching.
It should be about making people laugh,

376
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,540
right?
It shouldn't be about ethics or morals,

377
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:27,500
sexuality or race or sexuality or race.
It should be about making people laugh.

378
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,930
People pay to forget about that stuff.
Bitch,

379
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,190
you are on stage not making people 
laugh.

380
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,740
That is what you're doing.
You silly.

381
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:39,860
Fuck it is one of the silliest things 
I've ever seen in my life.

382
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,190
It's like this is an.
He's essentially a beginning comic,

383
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,480
open,
open mic.

384
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,970
He's maybe been doing standup for three 
years,

385
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,440
so he does like videos and the videos 
are very popular and they're funny.

386
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,940
Yeah,
if you're from the south,

387
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:58,941
they're really funny.
Just someone's doing your shit unless 

388
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,900
they're stealing or stealing from 
somebody else,

389
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,350
just do your fucking act.
Unless something happened before you 

390
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,951
that's so egregious and ridiculous that 
you feel like you have to address it 

391
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:14,301
when you go on stage because it's just 
sitting in the room and to just try to 

392
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:17,331
do ever notice when you pick up your 
phone if you just try to do that and 

393
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,090
everybody's like,
what the fuck you not going to address,

394
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:23,091
which has happened.
Sometimes you have to address what just 

395
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:23,091
happened.
Like sometimes someone will go on before

396
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:26,700
you and just eat so much shit that you 
have to say something.

397
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,280
You have to say something.
You have to.

398
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,610
Yeah,
but what that guy did was ridiculous.

399
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,670
It's to tell someone what comedy is and 
what isn't.

400
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,370
I'd said I'd read an article about that.
This,

401
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,090
I'm assuming she's a gay woman,
wrote about like trashing Hannah Gadsby 

402
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,550
and going,
hey,

403
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,830
we're gay and we're doing standup 
comedy.

404
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,150
We're not.
We're not just preaching.

405
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,670
We're doing stand up comedy about her 
trauma and it's working.

406
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:55,671
You just don't see us,
so don't write us off and say comedy is 

407
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:55,671
dead because you don't see us.

408
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,430
I don't think Hannah Gadsby saying 
comedies dead.

409
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,740
I think journalists are saying comedies 
dead,

410
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:04,741
and I think we're all buying into it 
because these people were writing these 

411
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:07,981
articles.
They're not even in comedy there just 

412
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,471
comedy fans or fans of her and what I 
think she did and I've only seen part of

413
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:10,870
it.

414
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,890
I saw the whole thing.
I'll tell you right now.

415
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,080
Let me.
I was one joke I like

416
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,710
a lot.
Whenever she did is fine.

417
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,110
Here's the thing,
it's her artwork.

418
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,880
This is what she's doing.
It's fine.

419
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,060
Like it's.
It's.

420
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,820
If people enjoy it,
that's great.

421
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,420
The problem with comedy is that comedy 
is one category.

422
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,350
It's just comedy,
but comedy could be Cat Stevens,

423
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,950
it could be guns and roses.
It could be the Geto boys.

424
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,770
You know what I'm saying?
It's like when you go to see music,

425
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,560
there's very distinct genres.
There's no.

426
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,140
There's just comedy.
Comedy is just comedy.

427
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,250
Like you could go see a folk singer and 
what they're doing on stage,

428
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:52,251
like really slow and quiet his music,
but then you go to fucking led Zepplin 

429
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,420
and you go,
okay,

430
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,240
well that's music to how the fuck is 
that music too?

431
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,450
You know?
How is motley crew the same kind of 

432
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:02,450
thing?
Is Cat Power?

433
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,120
How is that?
How are they?

434
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,050
How are they the same?

435
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,320
Will they are both music just like we do
comedy and she's doing a version of 

436
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:15,171
comedy.
Some of it is really funny and some of 

437
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:16,740
it is her just talking about stuff and 
like a very serious way.

438
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,950
That's fine.
Yeah.

439
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,250
That we're not against each other.
This is what's crazy.

440
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,090
Everybody's like,
you know,

441
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,520
this is deconstructing comedy and comedy
is dead now.

442
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,950
Like what are you talking about?
That's crazy.

443
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,280
We know she's doing what she's doing.
If you enjoy it and that's what you want

444
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,840
to see more of,
go see that.

445
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:31,980
Yeah,
that's what she goes.

446
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,490
That's great.

447
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,150
She was a great joke about Unicorns that
I giggled about once a week and I'll 

448
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:39,930
tell her jokes.
It's all on Netflix.

449
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:41,970
You can see that and when I was growing 
up,

450
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:44,460
I knew more facts about unicorns and I 
did lesbians.

451
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,220
She goes,
there are no facts about you.

452
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,650
I was just like,
that's a good fucking.

453
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:54,110
That's a good fucking joke.
That is a good joke.

454
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,940
Yeah.
I mean that's her experience,

455
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:56,750
right?
She's a lesbian.

456
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,460
It's hard.
It's hard out there for a pimp.

457
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,770
I get it.
It's fucking like where we are.

458
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,500
I think people create unnecessary and 
artificial adversaries.

459
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,920
I really do,
and I think this is one of the ones 

460
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,150
that's going on right now in comedy and 
I see it all the time with this internet

461
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,340
thing.
It's like,

462
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,750
stop,
stop,

463
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,560
stop with the art.
I mean I fall into a too.

464
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:24,680
I buy a new too and I read some of these
articles like comedy is not dead.

465
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,690
What the fuck are you talking about?
It doesn't make any sense.

466
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,130
You read the article and you start 
thinking.

467
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:30,290
She said it like the way that.
Exactly.

468
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,160
You're like,
oh,

469
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,260
she's telling us I can't do comedy 
anymore.

470
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,350
She didn't say she just did something 
and someone interpreted it that way,

471
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,770
and if she says she can't do comedy 
anymore,

472
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,140
that's fine.
To me,

473
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,610
she could just do like now she's famous,
right?

474
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:46,810
She could just do one woman specials or 
one person specials or one entity.

475
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,770
Hi,
how are we

476
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,390
framing that?
I wouldn't even say it.

477
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:50,830
Joe,
can I say the gender?

478
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:56,050
I wouldn't even be like.
She doesn't think gender's often off 

479
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,050
subject.
You can't.

480
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,830
It's,
it's off limits.

481
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,370
Gender.
I imagine that when you're a kid,

482
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,660
if somebody came up to you,
uh,

483
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:06,661
one day you're going to have to ask 
someone whether they're a boy or a girl 

484
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:07,660
and it's going to be very delicate and 
you're gonna have to ask them what their

485
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,460
preferred pronouns are.
He'd be like,

486
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:10,320
what?
Yeah,

487
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:10,710
yeah,
yeah,

488
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,800
it's coming.
It's real soon,

489
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,600
like 10,
15 years.

490
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,780
And then everyone's gonna be this is 
gonna be a lot of ambiguity and 

491
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,690
ambiguity.
That's a weird word.

492
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,150
Ambiguity.
How often you say that word?

493
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,540
I'll say ambiguous,
but how often do you say ambiguity?

494
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,490
I've never said it.
That's a weird one.

495
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,900
I stay away from a lot of big words,
especially after coffee ambiguity.

496
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,630
Yeah.
But nobody would have ever anticipated 

497
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:37,630
that there would be debate about gender.

498
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,420
Oh,
my daughter's,

499
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,700
uh,
we're outside of one of the progressive 

500
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:44,700
bathrooms were not,
it's just the bathroom.

501
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,360
And my daughters saw her first dick that
way.

502
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,470
Just pushed open the door because it's 
no man or woman.

503
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,060
And then she's like,
oh ha ha.

504
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,320
And I was like,
what does it matter?

505
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,910
She goes,
I was just saw a man's penis.

506
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,040
I was like,
why didn't the guy locked the door?

507
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,840
Sometimes you don't.
I've done it.

508
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:02,030
You walk in and you're not thinking and 
you just don't lock the door.

509
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,430
So was it at any sex bathroom or was it 
a,

510
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,820
any gender bathroom?
I don't know.

511
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,330
They have,
I don't fucking know.

512
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,160
You know,
I was in a restaurant once,

513
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,660
a restaurant once and I was waiting for 
the bathroom.

514
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:17,140
It's a long fucking white man.
And uh,

515
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,720
finally the door opens and a chick comes
out the men's room and she looked at me 

516
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:24,230
like,
like,

517
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:25,110
yeah,
I was in.

518
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,190
I was in the men's room.
Like what if I was in the women's room 

519
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,910
taking a shit?
What if you were in there?

520
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,590
I've done that.
A big steamer.

521
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,660
I did that coming off of a plane from 
Atlanta,

522
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,150
went to the women's room,
Ireland to Atlanta,

523
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,460
Busan on the flight.
There's a while ago,

524
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,070
headsets in Hoodie on bowel to take a 
shit.

525
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:49,071
I'm like,
it's creeping up my pants and I walked 

526
00:22:49,071 --> 00:22:51,351
into the bathroom,
starts shifting headsets still in 

527
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:53,631
listening to music,
starts sweating a little bit because 

528
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:53,631
it's so hot in there.
Take the Hoodie off,

529
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:54,680
take the headsets on.
They hear women's voices and I'm like,

530
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:54,740
yeah,

531
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,160
oh my God.
I'm shitting in the woman's bathroom.

532
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,560
I did that at the comedy store.
Once I took a leak in the women's room.

533
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,590
I didn't realize it when they put those 
new bathrooms and the side hallway 

534
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,130
because for a while was it was like a 
men and women's bathroom and then they 

535
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,941
opened up the men's bathroom over there 
and I walked in and there was girls in 

536
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:12,941
there.
I'm like,

537
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:14,330
hey,
how's crazy?

538
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:19,331
We're all in here together.
Isn't it funny that you can be next to 

539
00:23:21,781 --> 00:23:26,781
people?
Here's what's odd about genitals are 

540
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:27,690
involved,
right?

541
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,870
You could be standing next to those same
people in an elevator.

542
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:32,470
It would be fine.
Hi Guys.

543
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,190
Doing everything's fine,
but if you stand next to the same people

544
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:36,150
in a bathroom,
you're like,

545
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,980
oh no.
Oh No.

546
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,900
Private Parts,
naughty parts.

547
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:44,901
Poopy pep.
When you know like there's something 

548
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:47,661
dirty about.
Even if everyone is just washing their 

549
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:47,661
hands

550
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:49,190
close to each other in the sink,
it's like everyone's creeped out.

551
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,600
I can't wait to get the fuck out of 
here.

552
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,300
The tension is so thick.
That bathroom.

553
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,590
It's weird.
It's crazy that you can't just shit and 

554
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:58,590
Piss in front of people.
No,

555
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:58,590
you can't.
You can't see.

556
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,371
We grew up where you could ship in front
of dudes like we used to shit in front 

557
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:03,371
of dudes.
Like if if like,

558
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:06,710
I'm still kind of like this,
but like if me and you were talking,

559
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm like,
Hey,

560
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:12,071
come in and I gotta take a Shit I 
would've shot and you would've stood 

561
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:12,071
there and I would've finished telling 
you much.

562
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:12,440
I Bet Joey Diaz is that kind of guy?
Do.

563
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Oh,
joys is taking horrible shits in front 

564
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,520
of me.
Yeah,

565
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,351
I saw already knew it online.
Do you remember that clam video was 

566
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:20,351
there?
Oh my God.

567
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,520
I remember seeing that.
I was on the road in a,

568
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:25,360
in a green room and I saw someone's 
like,

569
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,900
you using an artist asshole.
And I was like,

570
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,730
I have not had a hemorrhoid problem and 
that's to put it mildly.

571
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,010
He still has them word problem.
Is this still do?

572
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,430
When we were,
when we were in Atlanta,

573
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,580
he was like,
how much blood should come be in a 

574
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:45,580
toilet after you go to the bathroom?
A lot.

575
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,460
But can you imagine Tom's face?
You know Tom,

576
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:52,461
so drives like a nun.
A Don't put that up.

577
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,630
Don't put that up.
Don't put that up.

578
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,230
Don't put up.
I was just telling Jamie back like 

579
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,040
before you got here,
how important those videos were.

580
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,120
All the videos you shot with Brett with 
red band and Ari and Joey,

581
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,880
the joey karate,
all the stuff you guys use to put online

582
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,860
that's so important to where you are 
today,

583
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:15,410
in my opinion.
What do you mean a man?

584
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,680
The I found that stuff when youtube 
started blowing up,

585
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,920
that stuff was in such heavy rotation 
for comics,

586
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:27,130
like you'd look for comics and you were 
recognizable because of fear factor in 

587
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,130
news radio.

588
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,020
But I've got to those videos and I 
probably watched every single one of the

589
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:34,190
videos you guys shot as,
as did all of us.

590
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:38,630
Tom Did all of us just because it was 
like it was the content we could find.

591
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,790
That's what we're talking about with 
twitch is like get on twitch now and 

592
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,590
start uploading content because one day 
someone will see it and go,

593
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,610
oh,
I know that guy.

594
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,940
And,
and I really believe that you guys were 

595
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,220
so ahead of that curve where people are 
like,

596
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,890
I'm not,
I don't even know how to upload a video.

597
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,060
You guys had edited great content 
Heckler in Columbus,

598
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,580
uh,
already dealing with a heckler in DC.

599
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,890
The car,
the feminist arguing with you,

600
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:05,900
that guy,
you choking that guy out the store.

601
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,550
Like those were videos where you're 
like,

602
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,040
I'd watch them four or five times.
There was a lot of those.

603
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,040
But you know,
what was really good about it was red 

604
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,040
bands editing.
He doesn't like to do that though.

605
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,300
It's too much,
too time consuming and he's too lazy.

606
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,540
He just doesn't like to do video.
But he's really talented like his video 

607
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,441
editing skills like that.
Men See a video that was part of why 

608
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:27,530
that video is so popular because it's a 
long ass video,

609
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:30,380
but he's editing skills are so good.
What was the music you played?

610
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:35,270
Dead and it was.
The music was perfect.

611
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,800
Yeah,
it was.

612
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,810
The whole thing was,
you know,

613
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,210
he's a really good editor.
He really,

614
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,310
he's really talented at it,
but it's so time

615
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:49,310
consuming.
It drives them nuts that he'd rather 

616
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,310
just fuck around and do podcasts and 
have a good time.

617
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,680
But when he was doing it,
like when we were going on the road 

618
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:54,680
together and he was filming a lot of 
stuff and splicing things together would

619
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,220
make a video every couple months or 
something like that.

620
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,990
It was really fun.
It was,

621
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,820
it was an interesting experiment,
you know,

622
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,230
just just,
just to fuck around.

623
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,660
I got into when I got into blogging or 
Jamie was like right there when I 

624
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,831
started blogging because we were both 
found Casey Neistat I think at the same 

625
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:14,461
time,
and I got really into blogging and I 

626
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:14,461
loved it.
Man,

627
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:15,580
I don't.
I think I maybe did like 40 episodes and

628
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:20,581
it was just fun,
but then I started realizing it was 

629
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:22,270
cannibalizing my life to a point where I
wasn't living an authentic life at all.

630
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,570
I wasn't writing any material.
I was just shooting everything.

631
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:27,250
Everything was shot.
Like if I saw you,

632
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:28,210
I'd be like,
I wouldn't be like,

633
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,860
oh cool.
I get to hang out with Joe.

634
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:30,310
I'd be like,
oh,

635
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,140
hey guys,
I'm a Jew,

636
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,930
you know?
And I was like,

637
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,450
that's it.

638
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,120
The trap that people fall into.
You know what I mean?

639
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,890
If you look on some people's instagram 
stories,

640
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,570
you're like,
what are you doing man?

641
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:44,571
You have a million dots.
Your instagram was like little tiny 

642
00:27:44,571 --> 00:27:44,571
dots.dot,
dot,

643
00:27:44,571 --> 00:27:45,540
dot.like
your whole day,

644
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,610
your whole day,
you have just a phone in front of you.

645
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,750
What do you just have like constant 
battery chargers and you're just 

646
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,310
constantly charging up your phone and 
film and video.

647
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:53,910
This is crazy.

648
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,380
I do it this way.
I look at Instagram,

649
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,560
I do it.
I'll do those stories aggressively if 

650
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:00,560
I'm running the triathlon,
running a marathon,

651
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,890
doing a big event and that's not to tip 
the hat or whatever.

652
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,850
We're telling you guys my business plan,
but that's what I do like it.

653
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,940
I like to do big things and then that's 
how my stories and then I'll fuck around

654
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:14,820
on the weekend and I'll put up maybe 
like three stories a day,

655
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:17,760
five stories a day and I'll show you my 
life a little bit.

656
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,680
But for the most part I like,
I try to,

657
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,950
I try to distance myself from it for two
reasons.

658
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,270
Number one,
it fucks with my eyesight.

659
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,990
Like if I'm on my phone a lot.
Oh yeah.

660
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,650
My eyes are fucked.
Yeah.

661
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,300
And number two,
it does cannibalize your life,

662
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,970
but what I would like,
what I want to do,

663
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:37,971
I think the next level is businesses is,
is honestly like going backwards and 

664
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:40,560
doing what you and red band we're doing 
with those videos.

665
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,590
But getting yourself out of it and 
having a guy like red band who that's 

666
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,590
his job.
It's hard.

667
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,810
No.
See,

668
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:49,680
the thing is with a guy like red band,
it's that job is very hard to do.

669
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Like Brian is uniquely talented at that.
I think that's his greatest talent.

670
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,740
He's really good at making videos.
But he,

671
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,890
like I said,
he doesn't like to do it and a lot of 

672
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:03,890
people don't like to do it because it's 
time consuming.

673
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,730
So you could just take stuff and just,
you know,

674
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,100
cut it and paste it.
But he did more than that.

675
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:11,380
He had special effects and music and you
know,

676
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,400
what he was doing was he was figuring 
out a way to make sometimes mundane 

677
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,840
situations.
Interesting and interesting situations.

678
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,670
Way more interesting.
Yeah.

679
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,580
It's hard to do.
So like for you to say,

680
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,810
you know,
you want to get you,

681
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:29,820
like you'd have to find a guy,
like you'd almost like to have to get 

682
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:29,820
Brian to start doing it again.

683
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:29,820
I,
I,

684
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,200
I've,
I'm definitely,

685
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,850
we,
Jamie and I were talking about this.

686
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,660
My next step is doing what you're doing 
on a much smaller level,

687
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,640
like getting an area,
getting a space,

688
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,470
doing my podcast and my solo podcast of 
there.

689
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:45,370
But then creating content.
What is your Solo podcast?

690
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:47,890
You have a solo ones?
Well I do a solo podcast.

691
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,990
Talk to yourself.
No,

692
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:51,910
it's called open tabs.
So I go through out on the weekend,

693
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,850
like when I'm normally killing time,
looking on the Internet and I just leave

694
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:59,851
all those tabs open on safari and then I
go in and I just go through and close 

695
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:01,540
them and tell you what they are and show
you the video I was watching.

696
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Oh it's like it's a lot of videos of you
and like all my friends because I 

697
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,970
watched all my friends do shit.
Like if bill bird kills on some 

698
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:11,970
interview,
I show that.

699
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,220
Um,
or if you like,

700
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,600
like a lot of,
I mean a lot of them are like the 

701
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,080
interviews you have with these guys like
David a Tia and,

702
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,880
and campaigns are campaigns is like all 
those,

703
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,920
all those like really inspirational 
guys.

704
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,980
I'll pull up videos of them and then I 
all sudden I'll get obsessed with flash 

705
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,070
floods.
The fucking flash floods is scary too.

706
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:36,150
There's this guy no joke.
Like I think I'm a good comic this 

707
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,720
better at what he does,
but he tracks flash floods and he's 

708
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:39,720
like,
he's like on camera.

709
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,900
Like okay,
I'm in this valley,

710
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,970
see this cloud over there?
It's raining over there.

711
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,970
He shouldn't be doing some 15 minutes.
All right,

712
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:50,010
we're going to with it.
And this guy finds a plot of land where 

713
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,220
the flash flood or run and he can chase 
it and almost follow it,

714
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:53,890
follow it,
hop up on the bank and then cut a corner

715
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:54,970
and get in front of it again.

716
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,070
This guy is so good at fucking following
flash floods.

717
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:02,490
There's this girl that,
this is what I find on the Internet 

718
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:02,490
because like I get online,
there's this girl,

719
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:02,800
Kimmy Warner.
Okay,

720
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,520
this girl is the best.
I'm obsessed with spear phishing right 

721
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,790
now and I've never fishing,
never done in my life,

722
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,160
uh,
obsessed with spirit.

723
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,240
I watched spear fishing videos.
Joe Maybe eight hours a day.

724
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,240
Why do like it when I'm in bed?
And you know,

725
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:22,670
when you're killing time kimmy warner to
pull up kimmy wonder,

726
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,720
this woman is a fucking amazing.
This is the picture of her swimming with

727
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,730
a great white shark to that kind of 
spear phishing woman coming on next 

728
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:31,730
week.
Who?

729
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,370
Valentino Thomas.
I don't know her.

730
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,700
I'm googling the fuck out of her.
Google Valentine Thomas.

731
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:41,701
She's coming on next week.
She was a lawyer who a quitter Gig and 

732
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:46,770
it became a,
like a very active and active on social 

733
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:49,010
media spear fishermen.

734
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,900
Oh,
she's beautiful.

735
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:54,901
Where's she out of Florida keys.
She's in Florida somewhere on the west 

736
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:56,560
coast of Florida is a big spear fishing 
community.

737
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,630
Shooting a lot of hog head groupers.
By the way.

738
00:31:58,631 --> 00:32:00,790
This is where I talk about something 
I've never fucking done.

739
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,380
We should do it.
I'll do.

740
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,370
I'm in.
I'm in.

741
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,110
Let's do it.
I want to spear fishing.

742
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:10,111
Apparently.
It's like hunting underwater dude and 

743
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:10,111
out now.
Are you ready for this?

744
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:12,340
This is what is wrong with me is that 
I've watched so much spear fishing.

745
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:15,640
I'm going to talk about it intimately.
The thing about shooting out on the west

746
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,650
coast of Florida is they use a lot of 
Hawaiian slinks.

747
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,880
Alright.
Very different than the average spirit.

748
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Hawaiian sling.
I'm glad you asked joe to rubber bands 

749
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:31,930
and use a rubber band with a pointy 
stick.

750
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,960
But when kimmy werner goes,
she's got like string,

751
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:39,440
like she'll shoot a tuna and it'll take 
off and she'll hold on and ride with it.

752
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,580
Oh Jesus.
Yeah.

753
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,400
It's ride the tuna.
I think it's just based on the depths of

754
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:48,401
where you hunt.
So when you hunt over on the west coast 

755
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:48,900
and now I'm talking out of my ass.
Do not listen to anything I say been,

756
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,100
but it's a lot of shallower shoots.
It's like 30 feet.

757
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,130
A lot of reef shoots out in Hawaii.
Kimmy Warner goes down like a hundred 

758
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,550
feet and chills.
Whoa.

759
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,090
And just chills and feet.
One hundred feet.

760
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,950
Me.
And you'll be good in the Bahamas.

761
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,690
Yeah.
Bahamas.

762
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:07,310
Six feet.
The Ah,

763
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,320
that's what I'm looking at.
Just over your head where you can still 

764
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,520
sand down to nine.
If you get crazy.

765
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,750
Get done.
Nine,

766
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:17,170
you can push off the bottom.
Pop back up again bro.

767
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,400
I'm obsessed with spirit.
Such a,

768
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,400
such a cool way to live your life opera.
He's done a bunch of it.

769
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:23,890
Uh,
I would,

770
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,770
I would love to try it.

771
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,750
It looks like fun.
She invited me.

772
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,900
Valentine invited me to go next week,
but I have the time.

773
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,750
It's going to go to San Diego.
They're going to go tuna spear fishing.

774
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,510
See then San Diego,
those,

775
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,080
those.
Uh,

776
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:41,081
the Pacific Ocean Spear phishing is a,
I think it a little bit of sport sport 

777
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:45,461
like [inaudible].
You got to really know how to hold your 

778
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:45,461
breath for a long time.
It's different.

779
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:47,510
I think so.
I think only because of depths.

780
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,260
Like everything's pretty shallow out on 
the west coast and the east coast or the

781
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:52,430
east coast.
Everything's pretty shallow.

782
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,220
Every like all the keys you're,
you're doing like 15 feet.

783
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,590
Oh,
15,

784
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,760
20 feet tops.
But uh,

785
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,520
but on the west coast,
everything is a tad bit deeper,

786
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Huh?
At least from what I've been watching 

787
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,591
with Kimmy Warner,
there's a go to kimmy and there's a 

788
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:09,320
video of her.
No Shit hanging out at a hundred feet.

789
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,330
Just with the spirit.
Just waiting.

790
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,730
Yeah.
She got four and a half minutes to kill.

791
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,010
Why not?
Four and a half minutes.

792
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,030
She's holding our breaths.
Date.

793
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,690
She can hold her.
She's free diving.

794
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,210
Oh no tanks.
Oh Christ.

795
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,250
All free diving in like camouflage,
camouflage.

796
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:26,570
Shit.
Not Afraid of sharks.

797
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:27,890
Loves sharks.
Well,

798
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:28,670
you know what the heck,

799
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,120
soudas you ever heard of a heck suit?
They got the suit called a h,

800
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:35,720
e c s.
it's like a suit that there's some.

801
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,570
It's based on something.
I think it's called the Feria Day cage.

802
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,440
And what it does is it hides your 
electrical signal.

803
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,500
And one of the things about fish is that
fish,

804
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,870
uh,
apparently they read your electrical 

805
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:51,870
signal,
like the,

806
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,950
like you,
you can take a,

807
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,980
there's certain machines that like you 
could hover your hand over them and 

808
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,330
it'll register that an electrical 
signals coming off of your body.

809
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,480
But then when you put this heck suit on,
you run your hand over the same exact 

810
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:05,790
machine.
It shows nothing really.

811
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:06,480
Yeah.
So this,

812
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,570
this suit is something that,
it's very controversial in the hunting 

813
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,571
community because some people don't 
believe it really works because there's 

814
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,650
no real clear absolute studies that it 
works on animals.

815
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:21,651
But there are clear studies that had 
shields your body's electrical signal 

816
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:26,300
and.
But it works pretty unequivocably on 

817
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,300
fish,
on fish.

818
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,270
It's crazy.
You got to pull up hex sue hecs suit,

819
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,830
video fish.

820
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,600
So you basically roll into the water,
like Predator put you put gloves on

821
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,100
Sudan and they can't see you

822
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,650
like they,
for whatever reason you can get right up

823
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,600
to them.
It's fucking weird man.

824
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,750
But you know,
yeah.

825
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,880
You get right up to fish right up to 
like corals.

826
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,860
They get right up to coral reefs.
See,

827
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:51,000
now,
here's the thing,

828
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,240
I don't know how much of this would 
happen exactly the same way if this guy 

829
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,500
wasn't wearing this suit because I don't
really,

830
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,030
I don't really have that information,
but I do know that people that spearfish

831
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,480
and people that are involved with,
uh,

832
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,190
you know,
underwater diving and shit,

833
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,860
they swear by these things,
they,

834
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:11,550
they,
they say it absolutely works.

835
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,400
And they had it on shark week two.
There were using it on shark week.

836
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,580
There's something about those suits.
Yeah.

837
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,600
I don't know.
I,

838
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,630
our,
I was going to go out to the Great 

839
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,010
Barrier Reef with Ari if Tom was going 
out there at the same time.

840
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,960
We're all three going to go dive at the 
Great Barrier Reef.

841
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,630
Do a liveaboard.
Arjuna.

842
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,730
Actually,
I've been talking back and forth about 

843
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,340
finding a place to do a live aboard and 
go overboard.

844
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,680
The other boat and we stayed for like 
four days.

845
00:36:36,681 --> 00:36:39,020
You do two times a day.
Do you like him?

846
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,120
Yeah.
Wow.

847
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:47,170
Yeah.
Archery's adventure or he's all about 

848
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:47,930
living life and if I can move,
fold that into my family and let my wife

849
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:49,160
understand that like,
you know,

850
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,710
once a quarter I got to do something 
crazy,

851
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,910
you know?
Then,

852
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,110
and then my wife's like,
oh,

853
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,930
she's cool with it.
We talked to a few.

854
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,560
What's the ultra marathon runner that 
you had on Courtney Dot Walter?

855
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,440
Nope.
Back.

856
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,410
Bitter.
Bitter.

857
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,510
Is that bitter?
Me and Ari,

858
00:37:04,511 --> 00:37:07,700
we're going to find a international 
marathon to do together.

859
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,820
Like find an international.
Really 26 miles.

860
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,560
Yeah.
Regular math.

861
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Yeah.
Not like one of those ultras that's 

862
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,030
breaking down your liver.

863
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:22,030
Will you pissed diet coke man,
let me tell you something I've always 

864
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:24,650
had respect for like I've always had 
respect for cam.

865
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,600
Never,
never anything shy of that.

866
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,280
But when you run a marathon,
the respect you have for campaigns and 

867
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,520
guys like David Goggins it,
it enters a new stratosphere.

868
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,570
Yeah.
I can only imagine.

869
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,350
You're like,
whoa.

870
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,510
Like when David Goggins says,
embrace the hate,

871
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,490
embrace the suck.
Just just,

872
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,350
just decided not to quit.
That's where my brain,

873
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:47,351
when I went to the marathon,
I was like deciding not to quit and at 

874
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:48,770
22 miles both my calves just seized up.
My quads went into my legs and the woman

875
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:50,600
in front of me,
shit her pants and I was like,

876
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,280
you watched her?
She washed her shit.

877
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:53,540
Her pants,
a grown woman,

878
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:58,541
like an executive shit.
Her pants went down one leg and upper 

879
00:37:58,541 --> 00:37:58,541
ass and I went.

880
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,380
Since she stopped.
Nope,

881
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,830
she kept going gangster,
but like that,

882
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:05,690
that smell.
I asked when I started running pastor,

883
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,980
I was like,
fuck this bitch.

884
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,920
I was like,
please let her be an exact from fx or 

885
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:12,920
something.
You're like,

886
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,420
hey,
that would be hilarious.

887
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:16,160
But those guys,
like when I watch cams videos now of him

888
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:19,400
running in the afternoon and running 
here and he's doing a marathon a day.

889
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,870
Your speed he's running and the way he's
talking,

890
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:28,871
as he's running his inspirational beyond
measure from a guy like me where I go,

891
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,500
I want to get there.
Like I want to get like he's fucking.

892
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,900
I,
I can't.

893
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,770
I mean I can't,
I can't.

894
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,130
I can't put it into words now.
He's an alum and he works full time job.

895
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,720
That's really blows me away.
Yeah.

896
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,310
Are you not drinking know for how long?
I just haven't been for how long?

897
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,410
Not.
I mean I will be on stage.

898
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,580
Uh,
no.

899
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I mean I'll,
I'll take a drink with me at the end of 

900
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,530
the night,
like when I tell the machine story on 

901
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:55,530
the second show,
I'll have that drink.

902
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:55,810
That's it.
Yeah.

903
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,030
What's going on?
Nothing man.

904
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,320
Cleaning it up.
No,

905
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,500
I'm just,
I don't know.

906
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,490
I don't know growing up.
No.

907
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,030
I know I still party,
but like,

908
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,350
yeah,
like if I saw you at the store tonight,

909
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:08,240
I still partying and smoking but I just,
I dunno.

910
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,560
I think it is.
No,

911
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,050
this is what sucks about being me is 
like people to go with what's going on.

912
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,430
Are you sick or something going on and 
you're like,

913
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,320
no,
just I'm also regular.

914
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,360
Yeah,
it's fine.

915
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,740
Yeah.
Nothing wrong with that.

916
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:21,560
Yeah.
I,

917
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,090
I,
you know,

918
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:27,091
I did the triathlon and I didn't drink 
leading up to it and I did it and I felt

919
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:28,840
really good.

920
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,270
I just felt really good and I thought,
and you know,

921
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:37,330
you know when you have friends that I'm 
45 and so you start saying seeing 

922
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,140
friends that that lifestyle starts to 
effect in different ways and you go,

923
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:41,730
okay,
I want,

924
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,150
I want,
I don't ever want to quit drinking.

925
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,690
I don't ever want to quit smoking weed.
I don't ever want to go with Ari and run

926
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:48,430
a marathon and then not do mushrooms 
with them.

927
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:51,220
It's in Buenos Aires.
I want that to be a part of my life,

928
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,210
but I can't have that if I'm going at 
the pace I'm going at like I can't,

929
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,310
I can't have both.
Well you started

930
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:02,350
to rely on your body a lot more like 
what you're doing with all this running 

931
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,350
and you know,
these,

932
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,210
the,
the,

933
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,120
what was that one that you did where you
had to do all the obstacle courses,

934
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,210
race,
Spartan,

935
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:10,100
race,
doing a triathlon.

936
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:11,730
You relying on your body.
Yeah.

937
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Like part of your recreation now is 
relying on your endurance and when 

938
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:18,950
you're doing that and you're drinking at
the same time,

939
00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:20,240
you're just shooting yourself in the 
foot.

940
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,710
Yeah,
I mean I still,

941
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:26,711
like I said,
like we did the Spartan race and right 

942
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:26,711
after you sit up in the stands,
everyone has some beers,

943
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:31,360
couple of beers,
maybe a hit of a vape pen and then you 

944
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,360
just go home and you get a good night's 
sleep.

945
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,990
But you're right.
I think for me,

946
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,370
training for the triathlon was just,
it.

947
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,440
I couldn't do both.
I just was not able to do both.

948
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:42,080
And then when I got done I just,
you know,

949
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,930
I think a lot of like I was thinking 
about last night,

950
00:40:44,931 --> 00:40:47,390
I didn't drink,
I didn't drink last night obviously.

951
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,610
And um,
and I was like,

952
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:54,670
I was in the shower today.
I had a really hard time sleeping last 

953
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:54,670
night.
I was up all night.

954
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,580
I've just been doing a lot of press and 
so I think you empty your serotonin 

955
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:58,820
because you're giving everyone and 
everything.

956
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:04,330
And I was like,
and I was up all night with like a 

957
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,080
little bit of panic attacks and uh,
I definitely would've drank last night.

958
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,860
You get a panic attack.
Like what does that mean?

959
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,440
Like what happens for me?
Uh,

960
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,830
you kind of get blinders on and for me 
personally,

961
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:17,831
I will start saying the same phrase over
and over in my head again where I can't 

962
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:21,060
get it out like a,
like,

963
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,510
um,
right,

964
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,370
like my brain will go satellite of love,
Sad,

965
00:41:28,371 --> 00:41:32,840
a lot of love Satta Line of love,
satellite.

966
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:38,020
And then I'll start going.
Like last night I had a phrase going 

967
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,020
through my head and I was like,
fuck,

968
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,360
Z,
alarm on is the alarm on and I get up 

969
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:42,360
and I go check the alarm and then I get 
in bed and I go,

970
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,040
I should just make sure all the doors 
were locked.

971
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,170
And then I go and check all the doors 
and then I get up and go.

972
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,170
Did I lock the man cave?
I gotta get up and I locked the man 

973
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:50,660
cave.
Now normally that's where I will start.

974
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,300
Like if I have a few drinks,
that does not happen.

975
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,910
You know what's weird,
what Jamie was talking about this too,

976
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,570
it's at night.
Yeah.

977
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:03,670
At night when you get weirded out,
it's like when you're getting ready to 

978
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:03,670
shut off,
it's like,

979
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,820
can I shut the body off yet?
Is Everything cool?

980
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,170
I think meditation might help me because
I can't just,

981
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:10,790
I can't shut my brain off.
And then I'm like,

982
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:16,190
and then I go a tank for your man cave 
to take off all of my man cave.

983
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,970
Joe Makes you man cave.
It's like a office,

984
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,250
right?
It's like half of this probably you fill

985
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,890
a tank in there.
It will be really big in my man cave.

986
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,820
He'll be really big in there.

987
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,090
They get stuff that you don't have to 
get one that big.

988
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,730
They,
they'll have a,

989
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,970
they have a smaller one.
Um,

990
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,670
to have like one that's like a six by 
seven or four by seven.

991
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,480
Four by seven.
See,

992
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:43,490
I,
I would rather probably I'd rather 

993
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:43,490
sauna.
I love salt.

994
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,130
I love those infrared Saunas.
I love those songs.

995
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,950
Great to.
Yeah,

996
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,780
yeah,
yeah.

997
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,330
Um,
I was thinking about the house,

998
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,200
I was thinking about it this morning in 
the shower and I was like,

999
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:56,201
you know what man,
the sober October we did was so helpful 

1000
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:58,901
because I learned how to cope and go to 
bed with nothing with nothing.

1001
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,650
No NYQUIL,
no nothing.

1002
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,950
I was super helpful.
And then I learned little tricks like 

1003
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,410
drinking on planes.
I still may have a few drinks before I 

1004
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:08,410
get on a plane or a couple of drinks on 
the plane.

1005
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,340
But the difference is if it's an early 
morning flight,

1006
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,130
I don't need a drink,
get on the plane you don't need.

1007
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:16,640
I don't need it for.
Whereas of ways I just said I just gotTa

1008
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:17,630
do it,
you know,

1009
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,270
it was helpful for me to uh,
you know,

1010
00:43:20,271 --> 00:43:24,130
what's really interesting is it made me 
realize what,

1011
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:29,150
what's happening to you dreams when 
you're smoking pot all the time because 

1012
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,760
as soon as you stopped smoking pot and 
then your dreams become super vivid,

1013
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,360
like really vivid,
like excrutiatingly,

1014
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:37,310
vivid and strange,
bizarre.

1015
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:37,790
You're like,
oh,

1016
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:39,800
what am I doing to myself with the weed 
all the time?

1017
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,710
Yeah.
That's probably not good for my dreams.

1018
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,810
I want those dreams.
The vivid ones.

1019
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:46,640
Crazy ones.
You Take Alpha brain.

1020
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,440
I dude,
I told you actually you go to bed.

1021
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,800
I took out.
My wife made me stop because I was.

1022
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,800
I was a lunatic on Alpha brain because I
could feel it really immediately if you 

1023
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,730
take it before,
like I take a double dose.

1024
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,240
So like if I'm like these packets and 
you're supposed to take one packet,

1025
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,260
I'll take two of these packets with some
water before I go to bed.

1026
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:11,120
And then you know like maybe an hour 
before you go to bed and with no pot and

1027
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:15,260
Alpha brain you will have lucid intense 
fucking dreams.

1028
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,260
Like they're intense,
they're in,

1029
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:22,290
they're durable.
Like you realize your dream and they 

1030
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,310
don't wake up like they get lucid and 
you're in the middle of them.

1031
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,050
You know the way I described lucid 
dreams,

1032
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:31,720
like lucid dreams or like a delicate 
bubble that a kid would blow it

1033
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,670
and you can kind of almost catch it on 
your hand and then pop it pops.

1034
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
These were like basketballs,
like they weren't popping like it'd be 

1035
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,000
in the middle of the gym,
like,

1036
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,610
Oh,
I'm in a dream.

1037
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,020
Okay,
now we're in a dream.

1038
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,630
Let's just keep going,
and they.

1039
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,570
It wouldn't knock me out of the dream by
recognizing that I was in a dream,

1040
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,970
which ordinarily would immediately do 
it.

1041
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,620
Ordinarily I'd be like,
Oh my God,

1042
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:53,580
I'm dreaming.
Well,

1043
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:58,730
I'm waking up and then you just wake up.
I could keep myself in that lucid dream 

1044
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,570
state for a long time,
a lucid dream.

1045
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,870
Naturally and I,
I have fucking insane.

1046
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,940
I have.
I've been sold a show to comedy central 

1047
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,730
based on my dreams.
I have insane dreams.

1048
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,950
You should try it.
Do you know what Parasso Tim is?

1049
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,380
Never heard of that stuff.
It's another nootropic.

1050
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,170
It's a real potent.
And the.

1051
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,360
One of the interesting things about 
nootropics is there's a ton of them.

1052
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,480
There's a lot of different ones.
One of them they found recently is 

1053
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,790
creatine.
They found a creatine.

1054
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:25,530
Boosts your,
your,

1055
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,720
your mental performance.
Yeah.

1056
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,190
Really?
Yeah.

1057
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,370
Creatines Kinda a lot of benefits men,
because you think about it,

1058
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:37,371
right?
Create team makes your body retain more 

1059
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:37,371
water as well,
right?

1060
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:37,770
It's one of the things that people don't
like about.

1061
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:41,490
It kind of gives you like a chubby face,
like get a little little bloated on it,

1062
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,570
but what that's doing is just retaining 
more water.

1063
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,610
Right.
But if you have more water,

1064
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:52,620
it also makes you stronger like an APP.
It's proven over time.

1065
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,870
Taking creatine as a supplement,
it's very effective.

1066
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,210
It really does make you stronger.
It makes you bigger,

1067
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,370
so you've got to think like all that is 
like all this tissue and all this water.

1068
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,590
It's like it's probably just 
everything's healthier.

1069
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,830
Right,
and probably the flow of everything's 

1070
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:10,830
healthier to the conductivity of it all.
Obviously I'm not a scientist,

1071
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,890
but I would think that all that makes 
sense.

1072
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:17,340
Like you're like your brain works 
terrible when it's dehydrated,

1073
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,690
like have you ever been dehydrated and 
try to think it's.

1074
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,940
Your brain is so weak.
It's incredible how much dehydration 

1075
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,800
affects the way your brain performs,
but on the other side it should be that 

1076
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,200
way.
If you're really well hydrated,

1077
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,650
your brain would probably work better 
and the only makes sense.

1078
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,270
It's amazing how important water is.
Oh fuck man.

1079
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,410
To everything.
I got this nutritionist when I started 

1080
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:47,410
doing the triathlon,
like men's health covered it.

1081
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,380
Like they,
they're doing a documentary on it.

1082
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,440
What are they doing with the whole 
triathlon?

1083
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,120
They hit me up and they're like,
man,

1084
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,130
this guy connor read really cool guy.

1085
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,290
He's like,
he's just a fan of what we do.

1086
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,250
And he was like,
man,

1087
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,960
I love sober October.
I love you.

1088
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:02,630
And Tommy's bets,
you know,

1089
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,240
like there's a lot of people as bizarre 
as a sound,

1090
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:11,270
whatever we decided to do with these 
competitions that God inspired and lost 

1091
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,900
a ton of weight and yeah,
I've,

1092
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:13,140
I've,
I've seen a lot of that.

1093
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,860
It's also an amazing man.
He has been.

1094
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,770
And like guys hit me up and they're 
like,

1095
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:19,200
I'm running my first marathon.
I'm running my first spartan race.

1096
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:21,390
I'm me and my buddies are doing it.
When you're in Columbus,

1097
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:22,570
can you come hang out with us?
And,

1098
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,780
and it's,
it really is.

1099
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:26,430
I know Tom and I've talked about it a 
lot.

1100
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,100
It definitely was not our intention,
but we just wanted to.

1101
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,130
We were fucking around and then when we 
all did so rocktober at their do their 

1102
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,520
people to come up came up to me at the 
triathlon.

1103
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,520
This Guy Willie Nelson's his name and 
he's like,

1104
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,450
he's like,
Bro.

1105
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,500
He's like,
Holy Shit,

1106
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,720
the machine and it fucking sober October
with you guys.

1107
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:44,220
I was like,
really?

1108
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,980
He's like,
dude,

1109
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,030
no booze,
no drugs.

1110
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,170
Can you fucking believe it?
And I'm like,

1111
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:48,190
yeah,
I'm right.

1112
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,620
Like we shared the same month.
I'm doing it again.

1113
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,020
I'll do it again.
I'm going to do it every October.

1114
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,630
I'm just gonna make it a thing.
We should do something else too.

1115
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,070
Like right now it's almost September.
He has it like the 20th or something.

1116
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,780
What is it?
Twenty third.

1117
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,640
I'm assigned a lot of time.
Basically have a month to figure it out.

1118
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,670
Like what do you mean?
Add another thing inside sober October.

1119
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:14,700
Yeah.
I mean we can be sober and we could do 

1120
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,700
the yoga classes.
We could do it again,

1121
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,330
not getting time to do those fucking 
yoga classes and those are amazing for 

1122
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:19,420
that.

1123
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,180
That that was also amazing.
I did nine in a row.

1124
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,900
I did nine days in a row just to whack 
it out and when I did that I was like,

1125
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,960
it's amazing.
Like if you just know that you have to 

1126
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:30,960
do it,
you just do it.

1127
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,620
Yeah.
But if you don't know you have to do it.

1128
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,690
You find all sorts of reasons to not do 
it.

1129
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,900
Like I'll just go lift weights or.
Yeah,

1130
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,310
just go for a run.
Yeah,

1131
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:43,410
I'll just go do this,
but if feel like I have to get seven 

1132
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:44,470
more of these fucking things in,
in the next 14 days,

1133
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:46,130
I just do them right now.
Yeah.

1134
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,970
You know what's cool about them is that 
it's.

1135
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,880
This sounds silly,
but now I have hot yoga in my.

1136
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:55,120
You tell utility belt worth of workouts 
where I go.

1137
00:48:55,121 --> 00:49:00,121
Sometimes I'll go like,
like I'll come off the road and I'll be 

1138
00:49:00,121 --> 00:49:03,301
like,
comment on maybe I booze that weekend 

1139
00:49:03,301 --> 00:49:05,221
I'll be like,
Monday I'm doing a hot yoga and I'll go 

1140
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:06,090
to a hot yoga and I know how the poses I
don't have.

1141
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,440
I'm not embarrassed.
I know I've got the Mat,

1142
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,470
like doing your first hot yoga is 
embarrassing a little bit,

1143
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,740
but when you go back in it and you do it
again and you just pour sweat and you're

1144
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:15,520
like,
shit,

1145
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:17,290
I'm coming back tomorrow and then you of
course you don't,

1146
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:22,291
but it's courageous when you see people 
going to those classes that are like 

1147
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:28,230
really obese and they take that risk of 
being almost naked in front of these 

1148
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:33,421
people.
You got shorts on shit and some lady 

1149
00:49:33,421 --> 00:49:34,060
just did it the other day,
her first class and I was like,

1150
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:38,260
that lady took.
Obviously she's not physically fit.

1151
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:43,290
It's just not that active.
This is probably like super nerve 

1152
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,830
wracking for her to do.
She took up ballsy chance.

1153
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,050
It's a.
it's tough to do.

1154
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,830
It's tough to do anything.
It's tough to.

1155
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:53,790
You know,
it's tough to fucking take a kettlebell 

1156
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:53,790
class.

1157
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:55,000
Tough.
You've gone there.

1158
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,920
It's weird.
You get weirded out.

1159
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,080
When I started,
when I started the training and I had to

1160
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:01,480
go to a pool and swim and getting a 
speedo.

1161
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:04,600
Now I wear speedos all the time,
but for real to where one,

1162
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,730
like for real?
Yeah,

1163
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:07,540
for real.
For Real.

1164
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,310
Like to,
and do you have to wear one?

1165
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:11,650
Why is it that much better than shorts?
Oh my God.

1166
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:16,830
The drag is like,
it's you glide like a fucking dolphin 

1167
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,130
ever jagger off with too much lotion and
you're like,

1168
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:20,050
I don't even feel it.
I need to drive some of this off.

1169
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:25,000
That's a bad example,
but it's super specific to me.

1170
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,430
But you swam in the ocean recently?
Uh,

1171
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:30,680
was in Italy last week and I was 
swimming in the ocean.

1172
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:31,490
I was realizing like,
wow,

1173
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:33,200
it's so much easier to swim in the 
ocean.

1174
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,760
Oh yeah.
Salt water to float.

1175
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,350
It's so,
it's.

1176
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:39,860
So it's like way easier.
A little easier.

1177
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:44,861
It's like ways your open water swimming 
in saltwater in the Malibu.

1178
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:48,170
Triathlon is coming up.
That one's tough.

1179
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:53,171
It's a half mile swim.
But you're in a wetsuit and you're 

1180
00:50:53,171 --> 00:50:53,240
buoyant and you're in the saltwater 
swimming near great white sharks.

1181
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:57,140
I'm doing Malibu in here.
White sharks.

1182
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,840
They're everywhere around.
But when you're in a pack like that,

1183
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,570
oh well what's the odds of you get bit 
and just get into the center.

1184
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,060
Yeah.
That's where they go.

1185
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,790
Right for the middle.
Shoot up.

1186
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:12,791
Just that movie.
The Meg is supposed to be one of the 

1187
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:16,121
worst movies of all time for real.
We've seen that movie and say they say 

1188
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:16,121
it's doing great at the box office to 
this.

1189
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:16,760
We're.
Everyone's an idiot.

1190
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:23,340
It's supposed to be so bad.
It's a big shark.

1191
00:51:23,341 --> 00:51:25,350
They just fucking.
Nobody saw before who?

1192
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:28,890
Here it is.
It's doing as good as crazy rich Asians.

1193
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,900
Oh,
crazy rush agents killing it.

1194
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,780
Oh good.
Where is it?

1195
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,580
Killing it.
Yeah,

1196
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:33,960
I see that.
Hilarious.

1197
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:35,790
I want to see it.
The Meg,

1198
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:38,490
what's it got?
Ninety one percent like this movie.

1199
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:43,830
Forty seven percent rotten tomatoes.
Six point two on imd be.

1200
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,930
Hmm.
That's not bad.

1201
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,980
Like what's the.
What is the worst well received movie 

1202
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,830
recently?
It's been some really,

1203
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:54,540
really bad ones.
Right?

1204
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,010
Oh,
I got this.

1205
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,680
I could.
I could come up with this because I,

1206
00:51:58,681 --> 00:51:59,510
I,
I.

1207
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,450
There was one that came out recently and
everyone trashed it.

1208
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,300
Well,
I'm not going to say no.

1209
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,630
I got Gotti movie.
Didn't get like zero the movie.

1210
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,300
That's it.
Yeah.

1211
00:52:09,301 --> 00:52:09,990
The God,
he will be.

1212
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:11,660
He's writing again.

1213
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:12,030
Yeah.

1214
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,980
Let's see.
Does a movie I liked and everyone 

1215
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,000
trashed.
Oh yeah.

1216
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:23,170
I've got to leave that one alone.

1217
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,750
Burnett paper.
Yeah.

1218
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,660
That's fucking.
That's a business I don't want to get 

1219
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:36,660
into.
I don't ever want to do that.

1220
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,170
I see Tom doing it now.
He's doing some movies.

1221
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:39,040
I'm like,
yeah,

1222
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,230
good luck.
You know,

1223
00:52:41,231 --> 00:52:45,040
it's nice to see him blowing up,
but that movie thing is a trap.

1224
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,060
You get on those sets for 16 hours a day
and everyone's depressed.

1225
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:52,450
Everyone's tired and everyone's on the 
antidepressants.

1226
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,210
Fucking everyone.
Oh my God.

1227
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,480
He put on a movie set.
You talked to actors about what they're 

1228
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:00,480
on.
Well,

1229
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:00,480
you know,
my,

1230
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,200
my Welbutrin wasn't doing it for me,
so I got on Lexapro and I'm on Zoloft 

1231
00:53:04,721 --> 00:53:07,480
and I really find it just,
it's really balancing me out.

1232
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:11,980
And I started taking this.
I started taking that and Xanax a little

1233
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,350
here and a little bit like,
Whoa,

1234
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,020
everyone is on something,
dude.

1235
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,260
Fuck that.
You go to Columbia for eight weeks and 

1236
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:22,260
you live in Columbia and do the.

1237
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,970
I know Mark Walberg do that mile 22.
He just lived in Columbia.

1238
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,430
Eight weeks.
Fuck that.

1239
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,970
I'd much rather just to stand up.
I wouldn't mind doing.

1240
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:33,060
I'm not even joking.
I would love my dream,

1241
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,670
my dreams,
doing what I'm doing right now.

1242
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:39,840
Like I like to expand span that if I 
could do my own thing and expand that,

1243
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:44,870
that's my goal.
But if you said part of the business 

1244
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:45,270
easily like a news radio,
like a,

1245
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,390
like an ensemble cast.
That was hard to man.

1246
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,720
I would love a multicam well it's fun if
everybody gets along but you've got to 

1247
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:58,500
rely on all those other people to keep 
their shit together and you know it goes

1248
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,660
sideways.
Yeah.

1249
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:04,820
And then on top of that there's.
Sometimes the scripts don't work and 

1250
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,590
sometimes when the show's not doing well
then you have executives that chime in.

1251
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,220
I honestly think that like what you're 
doing with like somethings burning,

1252
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:12,480
that kind of shit.

1253
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:17,510
That's way better man.
Like you're the thing you're doing with 

1254
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:17,850
all things comedy,
like the cooking show,

1255
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:23,330
that kind of fun shit where there's no 
real bosses is way better for a guy like

1256
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:26,140
you are a guy like me,
a great podcasts,

1257
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:31,160
that kind of thing.
You're never going to be able to be 

1258
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,680
really authentically yourself with all 
these executives and producers and 

1259
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:39,740
network notes and all that shit.
They don't know what the fuck they're 

1260
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:39,740
doing,
man.

1261
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,250
That they just don't.
You know,

1262
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:45,330
occasionally you'll get good advice,
but when something gets through with 

1263
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,070
that,
that sort of system and becomes a hit,

1264
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:50,190
it's almost by luck.
It's almost like,

1265
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:51,090
wow,
what are the odds?

1266
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,880
It's like a salmon making its way up a 
river.

1267
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,900
It's why would it go up river the fuck 
are you doing?

1268
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,590
This is a terrible way to go.
You got to jump over a waterfall that is

1269
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:02,550
so stupid.

1270
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,500
It makes no sense.
It's so dumb,

1271
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,290
but the one that makes it and spawns 
like,

1272
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,340
look,
this is our system.

1273
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:09,960
It works like,
okay,

1274
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,660
I guess this is it,
but it's almost like that.

1275
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:15,810
It's like you're doing something that's 
like so counterintuitive.

1276
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:20,930
You're doing something creative and 
you're being judged and an ordered 

1277
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:23,070
around by people who have zero 
creativity.

1278
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,140
They're not funny.
If there were funny,

1279
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:26,850
they'd be comedians.
They're not funny,

1280
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:32,060
but yet they're telling you what to do 
and then you have to think about their 

1281
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,331
notes and you got to bring in the gay 
roommate and the fucking the black 

1282
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,050
neighbor and the hot chick on the street
that everybody wants to fuck.

1283
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:39,090
And everyone's like tripping over.
Yeah.

1284
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,490
It's like,
I don't know.

1285
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:43,170
Thanks man.
So we went into,

1286
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:45,090
when we went and did that,
first something's burning me,

1287
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,820
Bill and Tom and I walked on set and I 
said,

1288
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,280
I'm super difficult to work with.

1289
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:53,100
Just want everyone to know that uh,
don't anyone stop me.

1290
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:58,130
Don't anyone do anything.
I'll let you know when we starting to 

1291
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:58,130
let you know when we're done.
And they're like,

1292
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:58,880
okay.
I said,

1293
00:55:58,881 --> 00:56:03,881
just cover everything.
Don't ever ask me to stop and do 

1294
00:56:03,881 --> 00:56:03,881
anything.
Just cover everything.

1295
00:56:03,881 --> 00:56:04,410
That's a problem.
When they go stop,

1296
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,420
rewind.
Say that again.

1297
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,350
What?
Yup.

1298
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,440
No,
get a camera on me and stay out of the 

1299
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:12,440
picture.
Just sleeping alone.

1300
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,120
They don't understand that every time 
you break that momentum,

1301
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,390
now I'm thinking about you and I'm 
thinking about that camera and I have to

1302
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:19,980
reset again.
Yeah,

1303
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,060
we did it.
We did.

1304
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:23,950
Me and Tom and bill.
Did that first one.

1305
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,520
Just one take both.
I mean both Tom and bill were like,

1306
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:28,660
I got 45 minutes.
I was like,

1307
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:30,220
perfect.
We see we've got it all.

1308
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:31,650
They got up.
I think they are arid.

1309
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,680
Almost all of it.
And then everyone loved it and then 

1310
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:36,680
deleon and Bobby Lee came in.
Same thing.

1311
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,530
I was like,
no one said anything to the best ones.

1312
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:43,531
Shaaban Brian Callin to me are my 
favorite because you see Brittany 

1313
00:56:43,531 --> 00:56:47,650
shopping.
He is so fucking funny in that very 

1314
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,340
funny dude.
He is so fucking funny in that that 

1315
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:50,340
like,
aren't you guys cook?

1316
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,490
Oh my God.
Yo.

1317
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:57,210
We cooked crab,
but we had to kill them on air and you 

1318
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:57,370
have to kill him in a humane way.
What?

1319
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:58,630
Yeah.
In order to do it,

1320
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,060
you have to kill him in a humane way in 
order to do it.

1321
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,490
In order to kill a crab legally.

1322
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,070
Especially on Youtube.
You've got to kill you main way.

1323
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,880
Yeah.
So you gotta it's gotta be within six 

1324
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:11,880
seconds.
Dude.

1325
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:11,920
That shot an elk with a bow and Arrow on
Youtube.

1326
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,650
You can go watch.
Go watch a elk,

1327
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,470
get shot through the heart with a bow 
and arrow.

1328
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,460
Don't even have to be careful with a 
crab.

1329
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,010
All I know is that the one note we got 
wasn't even have senses.

1330
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:24,830
Well,
Brian,

1331
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,240
cal take care.
Did he?

1332
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:32,610
He was so fucking funny.
As you start by lifting up their Dick 

1333
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:33,850
and they have a dick.
I think so.

1334
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,880
I think that's what it is.
And you jam it in and then when I'm it 

1335
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:38,880
in,
what is it?

1336
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,040
The knife.
Oh,

1337
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:40,660
well what the fuck?
How about you bring that up?

1338
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:48,080
Lift up that Dick and you jam it in and 
I'm thinking you're jamming their dick 

1339
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,080
in.
Why are you putting it?

1340
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,430
No,
you take the knife.

1341
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:50,320
He laid the crop.
I don't give a fuck them to death,

1342
00:57:50,321 --> 00:57:51,850
bro.
You lift up the Dick,

1343
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:56,851
you pop the knife in,
and then you've got to hit the other 

1344
00:57:56,851 --> 00:57:57,670
side of it within like six seconds and 
that's a humane death for the crab.

1345
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:02,910
Otherwise they're suffering.
So I show that to Brenda and Brenda's 

1346
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:02,910
like,
no bro,

1347
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:03,940
I'm definitely not fucking doing this.
And Brian just goes,

1348
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:09,030
I'll do it.
And literally like the Barbara Seville 

1349
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,210
goes through and kills 20 fucking crabs 
like this.

1350
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,440
I made them Chia Pino and they,
neither of them thought they'd like it 

1351
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,240
and they loved it.
What's Chia Pino?

1352
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,770
That's like a soup.
It's like A.

1353
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:20,230
Yeah,
it's like a fucking Brian.

1354
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,450
He's definitely fucking dead.

1355
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,690
He's cutting half.
Well,

1356
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,000
wait a minute.
How's this?

1357
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,730
Why is that humane?
Like what a weird thing.

1358
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,210
Like you have to kill them humanely as 
opposed to boiling them alive.

1359
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:32,280
Is that the idea?
Yeah.

1360
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:34,720
So I guess I'm not really surveil them 
alive,

1361
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,420
but like with lobsters,
they always boil them alive.

1362
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:43,080
Yeah.
And they'll tell you you're supposed to 

1363
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,080
boil them alive.
But I'm always like,

1364
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,080
well,
what do you mean?

1365
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,130
Supposed to like says who?
Like what happens if you don't boil them

1366
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:45,760
alive?
Like what?

1367
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:50,761
Magic doesn't know what magic leaves 
their body where they don't taste as 

1368
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:52,110
good if you don't boil them alive.
Yeah.

1369
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,100
I don't know about that.
Come.

1370
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:58,120
You can't just cut their fucking head 
off and then they're dead and then you 

1371
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,120
throw them in the boiling water.
Like what is,

1372
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,530
what's happening here?
Why do they need to be kept alive?

1373
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:03,520
That's a well where you want them to be 
fresh,

1374
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:04,790
right?
Yeah.

1375
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,460
Like there's a big difference in 
seafood,

1376
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:08,920
seafood and freshness.
That's huge.

1377
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,830
Like you don't see dry age seafood,
you know,

1378
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:17,040
like if you get a.
If you get a piece of beef from a 

1379
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:17,040
restaurant,
like a steak,

1380
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,100
a lot of times aged because the bacteria
on the meat actually starts,

1381
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,160
break it down

1382
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:27,340
and it makes it more tender and it 
actually gives it a lot of that mold 

1383
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:31,330
that they cut off of it.
You ever see dry age beef before they 

1384
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:31,330
slice it up?
No.

1385
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,690
Whole ready.
Okay.

1386
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,690
Show him.
Yeah.

1387
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,250
Yeah.
There's a guy

1388
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:37,530
that uh,
um,

1389
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,690
I follow on instagram that was doing 
something insane.

1390
00:59:40,691 --> 00:59:45,691
Like I think they had like a 200 day dry
age beef,

1391
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:50,560
which is just like even hearing about 
that.

1392
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:50,750
You're like,

1393
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,770
yeah,
that's what it looks like.

1394
00:59:52,771 --> 00:59:54,810
Yes.
That's what dry age beef look like.

1395
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:59,811
It looks like it's rotten,
like rotten meat and you lose some of 

1396
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:04,131
the meat.
I mean it's really wasteful in a way 

1397
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:04,950
because the outside edge,
that black shit,

1398
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,220
they cut all that off.
So you're losing you.

1399
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:08,970
Can you find a video,
Jamie?

1400
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:13,990
Of Trimming?
Just google trimming dry aged beef and 

1401
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:16,590
look up youtube.
Were you the guy that turned me onto the

1402
01:00:16,591 --> 01:00:20,340
guy that had his own fridge and was 
doing it his own fridge in his garage?

1403
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,990
Oh yeah.
I know a bunch of guys who do that.

1404
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:27,090
It's like A.
I think it was doing with elk dry aging 

1405
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:27,090
out maybe.
Yeah,

1406
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,260
if you guys do that.
So this is dry aged meat.

1407
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,020
So look at that.
Oh yes.

1408
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:30,720
The outside.
Look,

1409
01:00:30,721 --> 01:00:32,070
it looks rotten man.

1410
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:36,960
Hey takes the outside and you cut into 
it and then he,

1411
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I guess he's going to cut all the fat 
off and he's gonna turn it into steaks.

1412
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:45,790
I wasn't going to do with all that fat.
That's interesting.

1413
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,800
It was thrown into the garbage.
So this fat has he one easy thrown that 

1414
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:54,640
away.
So he's just got a.

1415
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:57,760
It seems like he's thrown that fat away.
Oh.

1416
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,190
So he keeps a lot of the fat on and the 
fan on top?

1417
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,030
Yes.
Dry aged beef on top.

1418
01:01:05,031 --> 01:01:07,040
He's just losing the sides.
Well Yeah,

1419
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,210
you're losing the outside of that

1420
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:11,820
just in this particular cut,
but on some steaks,

1421
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,340
you know,
it depends on how long he's dry aging it

1422
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:18,770
to like when some people go really ham 
with that shit though,

1423
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:19,620
you know,
like I said,

1424
01:01:19,621 --> 01:01:21,450
they'll dry age for hundreds of days.

1425
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:27,750
There's a lot of experimental stuff 
they're doing now where I'm find this 

1426
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,140
dude on instagram.
Do you do that with elk?

1427
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,370
No,
I don't know.

1428
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,640
I got to get you and cam on something's 
burning.

1429
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:34,420
Yeah,
we'll do it.

1430
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:35,500
I would love that.
Tam.

1431
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,120
Can't cook though.
You know Dudley.

1432
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:38,830
Dudley.
He can cook his ass off.

1433
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,940
Right?
I'm the cook.

1434
01:01:39,941 --> 01:01:41,290
I'll cook for you guys.
Yeah.

1435
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:42,670
You know.
Do you know how to cook?

1436
01:01:42,671 --> 01:01:43,960
I know how to reverse here,

1437
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,030
but if you ever fucked around with wild 
game,

1438
01:01:46,031 --> 01:01:51,031
I'll give you some today and um,
you could fuck around with it and then 

1439
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,020
if you get it right,
you know,

1440
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,330
we'll figure out a way to do it.
I'll give you some recipes and stuff,

1441
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:58,300
but it's not,
it's not that difficult,

1442
01:01:58,301 --> 01:01:59,860
but it is,
it's,

1443
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,730
it's more tricky than beef.
Beef is hard to fuck up,

1444
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,420
especially like a fatty beef because 
there's so much moisture,

1445
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:10,870
you know,
whereas a elk is basically,

1446
01:02:10,871 --> 01:02:12,490
you're,
you're basically eating a bodybuilder,

1447
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,680
you're eating an athlete,
you know,

1448
01:02:14,681 --> 01:02:19,681
and it's just a richer,
darker meat and has very little fat in 

1449
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:19,681
it.
But,

1450
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:19,810
um,

1451
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,470
if you do it right,
it's fantastic.

1452
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:24,570
Have you had it before?
I've had,

1453
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:26,520
I've had your ground elk.
That's,

1454
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:30,060
that's good.
But that's hard to like the right way to

1455
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:35,061
do it is to do an elk stake.
I got to fucking set up that God damned 

1456
01:02:35,061 --> 01:02:39,251
grill out here,
but we don't know how to have proper 

1457
01:02:39,251 --> 01:02:39,251
ventilation.
I got one of those,

1458
01:02:39,251 --> 01:02:41,100
uh,
yoder pellet grills in the back there,

1459
01:02:41,101 --> 01:02:43,920
but we don't know how to get the proper 
ventilation.

1460
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:47,820
We might need to get some sort of a 
permit.

1461
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:51,000
Put like a vent like they would do with 
a kitchen.

1462
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,200
God Damn.
I can't find.

1463
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:56,420
This guy's got this one.
I'm no rare gourmet meats.

1464
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,690
Ooh,
what does he got going on?

1465
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:04,620
See if you find like,
just google try 500 day dry age beef on 

1466
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:08,190
youtube.
Holy Shit.

1467
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,740
Yeah.
These guys don't fuck around.

1468
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,330
Can I tell you one of them?

1469
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:14,910
One of the coolest things you turned me 
onto what?

1470
01:03:14,911 --> 01:03:16,740
Fucking Adam Green Tree.
Oh,

1471
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:21,120
use an animal due to his insta stories.
Like I get bummed when I,

1472
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,240
when I skip them.
And then when he's on one of those epic 

1473
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:26,490
haunts.
Yeah.

1474
01:03:26,491 --> 01:03:27,100
No,
he,

1475
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,520
he does not fuck around dude.
That guy,

1476
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:34,521
uh,
he goes out by himself by himself for 

1477
01:03:34,521 --> 01:03:36,360
months at a time of extreme age steak.
What does it say in there for 20 days?

1478
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,010
Yeah.
This one's 400 on this one.

1479
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,540
Oh,
go to 400.

1480
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:44,630
Let's see what that looks like.
It probably looks terrible when they 

1481
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:46,130
start cutting it up,
back it up a little bit so we can say,

1482
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:49,920
just saw this online the other day.
Like I saw I saw this and I didn't click

1483
01:03:49,921 --> 01:03:51,150
on it.
So they,

1484
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,430
it's real weird man.
I mean,

1485
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:58,460
you're basically letting it rot and 
you're relying on the bacteria to not 

1486
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:00,570
completely flourish.

1487
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,340
Like you have to have a certain 
temperature.

1488
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:06,630
I think they keep it somewhere around 
like 40 degrees or something like that.

1489
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:09,140
And it's drive,
like,

1490
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,740
look at that.
It looks terrible.

1491
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,310
It looks like a rotten piece of what 
you're supposed to.

1492
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,400
He's going to eat that.
Yeah,

1493
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:15,480
they're gonna.
Eat this shit out of it.

1494
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:18,030
And look at that.
That is so weird.

1495
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:20,370
Dude.
That's so weird.

1496
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:25,190
It doesn't even look read anymore.
I mean it's white and I think that's,

1497
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:29,550
that's why you have you say it.
Why'd you,

1498
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:34,860
why'd you,
what's the other word for that was 

1499
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:34,860
another word.
Oh,

1500
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:34,860
coby.
Yeah,

1501
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,340
he it.
So keep it going.

1502
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,300
Sorry.
So He's,

1503
01:04:39,301 --> 01:04:40,790
uh,
he's,

1504
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:44,480
he's going to sear it I guess.
Yeah.

1505
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,440
And that throws some time.
Oh.

1506
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:51,441
And then he's gonna Sue v Ah,
you ever Suvi or have it takes forever 

1507
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:56,130
to Suvi eggs.
Does it our really for soft boiled eggs,

1508
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:57,570
I love soft boiled eggs.

1509
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:02,670
Susie's interesting man,
because you could have something and 

1510
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:02,670
cook it like say at a hundred and 25 
degrees,

1511
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:06,630
which is like where you want your steak 
to be and you could have it in there for

1512
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:07,830
hours.
You take.

1513
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:12,860
What you do is you take your steaks and 
you've got a vacuum seal and beat them 

1514
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:13,320
and then you can just let them sit.
You're not going to overcook them.

1515
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:15,690
And then see her that she was some 
butter and garlic.

1516
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,030
Yeah.
Or with a blow.

1517
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,750
I do a blow torch sometimes.
Wow.

1518
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,030
Yeah,
they have torches.

1519
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,640
Look at that.
That guy's got the butter and the time.

1520
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:26,530
Oh sweet baby.
Oh Jesus.

1521
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:27,910
What are you doing here?
You Fuck?

1522
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:33,060
Look at this camera slicing it open.
That's 400 day dry aged meat looking at 

1523
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:36,010
me.
So having a mouth chasm.

1524
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:39,070
Oh,
foodies are such dorks.

1525
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,200
They just,
they just get so into it.

1526
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,870
They just get so into it,
man.

1527
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,270
When you go travel and you go to like 
Thailand and stuff,

1528
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:50,410
do you get food and go in and try to 
find something dangerous and crazy or do

1529
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:52,570
you just pretty much stay?
I didn't eat bugs,

1530
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,640
but I had some really hot food.
Yeah.

1531
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:55,750
Yeah.
No bugs.

1532
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:57,750
They tried to serve me,
bugs my pitch.

1533
01:05:57,751 --> 01:06:00,570
I hosted fear factor for six years.
Get that shit out of my face.

1534
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,730
Wrong guy.
I'm not interested in your bugs.

1535
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,920
Not only that,
it doesn't gross me out at all.

1536
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,670
Like nothing grosses me out like eating 
bugs or anything.

1537
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:12,310
Throw up.
I remember your wife threw up in her car

1538
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:14,320
one time I think I was.
I came up either.

1539
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:17,320
I came over there and you were cleaning 
out your wife's car.

1540
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:17,900
I said,
what are you doing?

1541
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,600
You were like,
oh my wife threw up all over car,

1542
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,920
one of those green drinks and I was 
like,

1543
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:23,890
bring up.

1544
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,280
Like in brought up,
throwing up the other day.

1545
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:30,670
Just brought up throwing up and I 
started gagging on his podcast.

1546
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,650
Yeah,
I'm immune.

1547
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:38,460
I saw so many people throw up.
I've seen hundreds of people throw up 

1548
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,200
right in front of me and I had to talk 
to them while they're puking and I it,

1549
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:43,810
this is a learned skill because when I 
first started doing the show,

1550
01:06:43,811 --> 01:06:45,910
I would gag when I would see other 
people do it,

1551
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,270
but yeah,
but then after awhile it just went away.

1552
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,450
Like that part of me is dead,
it's dead.

1553
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,280
So when my wife threw up in her car,
I was like,

1554
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,630
I'll clean it,
can give a fuck.

1555
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,760
That's cleaning.
I cannot do that.

1556
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:58,870
I can't.
Even when my kids throw up,

1557
01:06:58,871 --> 01:07:00,040
I'm like,
I'm sorry you're on your own.

1558
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,650
Clean up all the puke.
If my kid's Puke,

1559
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:04,450
I am the designated puked cleaner.

1560
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,950
Oh,
100 percent of the time.

1561
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:09,040
One hundred percent of the time someone 
throws up in the bed or somewhere else.

1562
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,060
I,
I cleaned it up,

1563
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,910
dude.
I came back from Utah one time and I was

1564
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:17,140
firing hot and I had a crazy weekend and
I just wasn't feeling right and I.

1565
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,420
and we went and ate a big dinner and I 
don't feel good.

1566
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,860
I'm in bed,
I'm going to rope.

1567
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:24,550
I'm going to Yankees Robe that uh,
and I get up and I'm like,

1568
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:27,640
I'm not feeling good and I go into the 
bathroom and I go to shit,

1569
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:32,641
but I start throwing up before I can 
ship and I sit in the road and I shit in

1570
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:36,940
the robe and throw up on my lap and my 
wife's a thug.

1571
01:07:36,941 --> 01:07:38,260
She went,
we got this.

1572
01:07:38,261 --> 01:07:40,030
Let's get you in the shower.
I'll take care of it.

1573
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,460
I was like,
wow,

1574
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:42,540
that's a good woman,
right?

1575
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,430
Yeah.
That's a good woman right there.

1576
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:46,540
Yeah,
man.

1577
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:50,530
I like literally,
unless I'm out of town,

1578
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:54,520
my wife does not clean up puke.
She would tell me that the kid puked and

1579
01:07:54,521 --> 01:07:55,870
not cleaning it up.
Really?

1580
01:07:55,990 --> 01:08:00,990
Yeah.
Because she'll start throwing up and I 

1581
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:00,990
won't at all.
Does she?

1582
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:00,990
She takes care of the chickens though.
Um,

1583
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:01,930
yeah.
Sometimes,

1584
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,790
you know,
um,

1585
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:06,080
we have a guide that we hired to take 
care of the chicken sometimes,

1586
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,100
especially when we're not there.
He'll,

1587
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:09,880
he'll handle certain things like you 
have to.

1588
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,640
Chickens are a little bit of effort.
You know,

1589
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:15,010
you've got to up the cage.
You gotta collect the eggs every day.

1590
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,700
We had some squirrels,
steel and eggs.

1591
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,090
We had a real issue with that.
I got a squirrel that I have to hose out

1592
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:21,580
of our chicken coop.
Yeah.

1593
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:26,220
Well Marshall took care of that.
Marshall fucks up.

1594
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,260
Squirrels.
Dude.

1595
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,600
Marshall.
He is the sweetest dog of all time and 

1596
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:32,600
less your squirrel then.
He's the devil.

1597
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,390
I mean,
I never seen a dog so determined to kill

1598
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:36,560
a squirrel.
It's crazy.

1599
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:42,340
He goes out now and he looks for them.
He runs to the chicken coop and then he 

1600
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:46,391
circles the chicken coop.
Look and see where these motherfuckers 

1601
01:08:46,391 --> 01:08:46,391
are getting.
See if anybody's around there,

1602
01:08:46,391 --> 01:08:49,130
see if anybody's slipping.
But I was on the road.

1603
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:52,700
My wife sent me a picture of Marshall 
with a squirrel in his mouth.

1604
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,100
And she's so happy because she doesn't 
like squirrels.

1605
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:59,480
The squirrels are fucking up all the uh,
they steal all the chicken food.

1606
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:00,400
Yeah.
I like,

1607
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,480
I like squirrels.
I think they're cute.

1608
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,400
So like for me I'm like,
so what?

1609
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,050
They deal the chicken food,
get,

1610
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:08,780
make more chicken food.
But then they start stealing the eggs.

1611
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,310
And I was like,
Oh,

1612
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:14,120
you push up and he can't steal my food.
That's my food.

1613
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,480
You can't steal the eggs.
Let me find this for our chickens or 

1614
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:19,480
family members.
Yeah,

1615
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:19,520
they are right.
Yeah.

1616
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,180
When I came home,
when it was like,

1617
01:09:21,181 --> 01:09:23,630
you remember it was like 120 and all the
trees were dying.

1618
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:28,700
Yeah.
And I walked in and Leanne had chickens 

1619
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:28,700
in the house.
She's like,

1620
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:28,700
they can't be out there.
It's too fucking hot.

1621
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:29,640
Yeah.
But they do.

1622
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,400
They have to be out there.
Oh my God.

1623
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:33,830
Yeah.
He's all happy.

1624
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:38,950
This is,
this is ingrained in his DNA soft.

1625
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:40,730
So he doesn't like.
He's like,

1626
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:44,330
I want to bring it back to you a fully 
intact so that you can't.

1627
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,940
So that if you need this,
is that blood on his chest?

1628
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:47,750
Uh,
yeah.

1629
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:50,630
That's blood.
Yeah.

1630
01:09:50,631 --> 01:09:53,180
Well he brings things to you always 
because he's a retriever.

1631
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:58,180
So like he has a little box of stuff,
toys that he has in the house and he's 

1632
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:02,921
the only dog that I've ever had that 
doesn't mangle every toy you give them 

1633
01:10:02,921 --> 01:10:05,540
because I've had pit bulls and mastiffs 
and you give them a toy and they just,

1634
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,690
they just start tearing apart.
He has carries him around.

1635
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,190
He carries him around.
He brings to you.

1636
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,170
So like when I see him in the morning 
I'm like,

1637
01:10:12,171 --> 01:10:13,910
good morning sir.
Good morning.

1638
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:16,190
And he's wagging,
his tail is happy and the first thing he

1639
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:20,180
does is run over to his pilot toys.
Grabs one and comes over with.

1640
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:21,380
It brings you a president.
Yeah,

1641
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:23,090
he.
Well he has it in his mouth.

1642
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,590
He always,
he's a retriever.

1643
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:29,591
Like if you see retrievers running,
a lot of times they're carrying their 

1644
01:10:29,591 --> 01:10:32,291
leash in their mouth as they're running.
They love to hold on to things in their 

1645
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:32,291
mouth.

1646
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:33,860
Weird.
Does he dive in underwater?

1647
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,300
Oh,
he fucking swims like a motherfucker do.

1648
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,690
That dog is always in the water.
He just,

1649
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:43,780
he will die from the deep end of the.
Like if the kids are playing in the 

1650
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,120
pool,
he and I'll let him out the door.

1651
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:49,210
He runs to the pool,
stands on the edge and then leaps into 

1652
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,220
the water splashes.
How can loves it?

1653
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,150
Does he dive underwater though?
A little bit.

1654
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:58,330
That's what we used to have A.
I used to have a black lab and you can 

1655
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:58,760
throw one of those rings under water and
she dived to the bottom,

1656
01:10:58,761 --> 01:10:59,750
grab it and pull it up.
Oh,

1657
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:00,660
he doesn't do that.
Oh,

1658
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:03,250
I guarantee you he will.
I guarantee you he will have.

1659
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,820
Betty would if I taught them how to do 
it,

1660
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:07,810
but he swims like it's instinctual.
Those fucking dogs.

1661
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,440
That's my,
my bullmastiff.

1662
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:11,360
I cannot get her in the pool.
Really?

1663
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,410
She looks at me like,
like,

1664
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,010
like you're trying to

1665
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,450
pitch anal sex to your wife.
She's like,

1666
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,320
come on.
We both know how this is going to go.

1667
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:20,560
No one's going to be happy.
Yeah.

1668
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:23,240
Johnny cash and people always asked me,
um,

1669
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:27,630
to have pictures of my other dogs.
They're actually both passed away now.

1670
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:33,250
I had to put them both down.
Both your bull mastiffs stiff in the 

1671
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,040
English of the English bulldog.
She's,

1672
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:34,740
you know,
mix.

1673
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:39,750
They were uh,
they were both 13 years old and I'm.

1674
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:43,320
Johnny couldn't walk anymore.
It was,

1675
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:49,160
it was really rough the last few days of
his life.

1676
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:50,520
Um,
I would,

1677
01:11:50,521 --> 01:11:55,521
uh,
try to bring him in for dinner and when 

1678
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:56,850
I would try to bring them in,
he literally couldn't make it.

1679
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,170
It was a small yard where he was at,
but we're talking about like,

1680
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:03,270
you know,
15 yards.

1681
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,450
He couldn't make it 15 yards to the 
house.

1682
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:11,900
He would like take a couple steps and 
his body would shake and he'd take a 

1683
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:15,291
couple steps and he was just sleeping 
all day and he was also having a really 

1684
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:19,020
hard time shifting and he would 
occasionally shit in the house.

1685
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:24,050
Like he couldn't hold his bowels and he 
couldn't go outside when he wanted to 

1686
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:24,050
look at.
You'd see them trying.

1687
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:28,881
But his,
his body was so old from massive 13 

1688
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:30,480
years old.
His crazy old,

1689
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:35,720
like a lot of them died at like eight or
nine and he was 13 and he was sweet,

1690
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:39,570
sweet dog up until the end,
but he just,

1691
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:41,160
he was,
you know,

1692
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:43,410
he was suffering.
It was,

1693
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:49,130
it was hard.
It's hard when you know them when 

1694
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:52,071
they're a puppy and then 10 years later,
like you're kind of the same and they're

1695
01:12:52,261 --> 01:12:53,940
not men,
they're gone,

1696
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:59,030
you know.
So I think about that with Marshall 

1697
01:12:59,030 --> 01:13:00,060
because he's only a year and a half and 
he's so full of life and he's so fun.

1698
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:04,110
He's so silly and playful and happy.
I'm like,

1699
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:06,630
man,
there's gonna be a day where Marshall's,

1700
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:09,870
this old old,
old dog and I'm going to have to put him

1701
01:13:09,871 --> 01:13:11,100
down to,
you know,

1702
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:12,360
it was depressing.

1703
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,750
And the other one,
brutus the boot,

1704
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,110
you know,
English bulldog mix.

1705
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,900
He was better than Johnny for a long 
time.

1706
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:23,280
Still I've known for the last two years 
that they didn't have much time left.

1707
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:23,790
You know,
they were,

1708
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:28,791
they were both struggling hard,
but brutus took a real hard turn over 

1709
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:31,260
the last few months where,
um,

1710
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:37,190
he wouldn't even come in.
Like I tried to get them to come in and 

1711
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:40,640
somebody you want to eat,
I try to put a little food in front of 

1712
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,011
his face and he would try to stand up 
and his legs would be shaking so hard,

1713
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:47,400
man,
it's so hard watching them fade away,

1714
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,700
you know?
And then also watching them suffer,

1715
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,050
you know,
the last,

1716
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:54,840
the last days where you have to decide 
where,

1717
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,340
you know,
me and my wife had to have conversations

1718
01:13:57,341 --> 01:14:00,790
like we have to do something like this.
Like one day we're going to come home,

1719
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:05,791
it's going to be a dead dog.
And it's not like they're having a good 

1720
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:08,340
time.
Like this is a horrible suffering.

1721
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:12,070
Slow demise.
So did you have

1722
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,600
someone come to the house?
Where did you take them?

1723
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:16,930
Here was rough dude.
That's rough.

1724
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,940
Yeah.
Priscilla seven.

1725
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:25,360
And I mean I got her when I first 
started doing this 1:40.

1726
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:29,700
That's big dogs had five knee surgeries.
Oh my God,

1727
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,710
dude,
that's fucking expensive to.

1728
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:33,480
Oh,
you know,

1729
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,600
I do have an idea,
but you do.

1730
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,110
I had a,
um,

1731
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:40,480
a female pit bull that had two acl 
reconstructions.

1732
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:42,280
She had her,
both of her back legs done.

1733
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,040
She blew one out.
I got it fixed,

1734
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:48,880
blew the other one out.
I had to get that fixed to a dog.

1735
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:53,910
They shave the bone down.
They don't like reconstruct it where 

1736
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:57,370
they add like another ligament,
they shave the bone down so it doesn't,

1737
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,400
so it sits on the it differently.
So it locks in place so it doesn't pop 

1738
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:03,590
off and,
and,

1739
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:07,120
and go like at a,
at a socket or whatever the fuck it is.

1740
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:12,010
But yeah,
it's fucking like 10 grand a pop.

1741
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:12,310
Right?

1742
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,160
Oh,
it was.

1743
01:15:13,730 --> 01:15:18,730
I mean,
I'm not going to tell everyone how much 

1744
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:18,730
because I stopped liking me into minute.
They'd be like,

1745
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:19,400
what kind of fucking Hollywood idiot are
you?

1746
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:24,430
You just killed a dog like that.
But she got one acl and then we fixed 

1747
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:24,430
it.
Then the uh,

1748
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,720
then while this one's healing and 
turning good,

1749
01:15:26,721 --> 01:15:29,180
the other acl goes out.
So we fixed that one.

1750
01:15:29,181 --> 01:15:29,540
We're like,
alright,

1751
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,370
we're done.
And then as this one ceiling,

1752
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,800
this one goes out again.
And they're like,

1753
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:35,630
and that's when they're like,
do you want to put it down?

1754
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:36,650
I'm not,
I'm like,

1755
01:15:36,651 --> 01:15:38,480
no man,
I'm fucking,

1756
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,940
it was like five grand a pop I think and
then,

1757
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:46,300
and then it's,
it even adds up more because then 

1758
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:46,300
they're like,
we should keep her here while this,

1759
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,930
while she's healing to do it and then 
feed her diamonds and then they realize 

1760
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:52,880
they're doing this one,
that something's wrong with her kneecap.

1761
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,830
And then they realize she's got,
you know,

1762
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,330
it's overbreeding in her bra and her 
breed that are kneecaps are bad.

1763
01:15:58,331 --> 01:16:03,331
So they fixed this one,
this one replaced both her kneecaps and 

1764
01:16:03,331 --> 01:16:05,940
then one more goes out and they're like,
all right man,

1765
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:11,020
shit,
I hit that dog is duck greatest fucking 

1766
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:13,070
dog mastiffs are amazing.
There's some of my favorite dogs ever.

1767
01:16:13,071 --> 01:16:18,071
They're so chill dude.
The sweetest like gets up in bed with 

1768
01:16:18,071 --> 01:16:22,841
you in the morning and just puts her 
face right up on you and just does one 

1769
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:24,920
of those big cal brass like and you're 
like,

1770
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:25,910
oh,
I'm here.

1771
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:29,550
They're so relaxed too.
They're just a different kind of dog.

1772
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,290
Very relaxed,

1773
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,300
you know?
And,

1774
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:35,300
and I feel comfortable when I go on the 
road.

1775
01:16:35,301 --> 01:16:40,301
I feel comfortable knowing there's a 
hundred and 40 pound animal that will 

1776
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:42,230
give its life for my daughters.
It's one of the.

1777
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,090
One of our dog sleeps on one of our 
daughters beds,

1778
01:16:44,091 --> 01:16:49,091
one of our dogs sleep.
Priscilla sleeps in George's bed and I 

1779
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:49,091
go,
I'm good.

1780
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:50,390
No one's coming in anywhere and no one's
breaking in anything.

1781
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,090
Yeah.

1782
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:55,470
I got a buddy who was a German shepherd,
a police dog and uh,

1783
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:57,240
it's uh,
it's,

1784
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:02,420
it's one of those dogs that he has to be
with all the time and train all the 

1785
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,200
time.
But this dog,

1786
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:09,590
it's disturbing thing to have because 
you basically have an assassin that 

1787
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:11,420
lives with you.
This is just waiting for orders.

1788
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:12,680
Just waiting.
Yeah,

1789
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,070
my buddies,
my buddies got a German shepherd that he

1790
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:18,250
hasn't quite figured out yet.
And,

1791
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:19,390
and,
uh,

1792
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:23,810
you can't work a full time job and just 
leave that thing alone in the yard.

1793
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,180
You just can't.
They're intense dogs.

1794
01:17:26,181 --> 01:17:28,970
Their intent and their smartest fuck.
So in a weird way,

1795
01:17:28,971 --> 01:17:30,800
it's like dealing with a complicated 
chick.

1796
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,100
You're like,
I know you have daddy issues,

1797
01:17:34,101 --> 01:17:36,280
but I can't really figure him out and 
I'm not spending a lot of time,

1798
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:37,480
enough time with you.
Oh,

1799
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,570
you can't fix them.

1800
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:43,010
You could train a dog training.
A woman can't add in here.

1801
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:44,330
You can't.
If you meet someone,

1802
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:49,340
I don't hear a woman or a man.
You meet someone who's completely 

1803
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:49,340
fucking crazy.
You gotta get Outta there.

1804
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,330
You gotta go.
You can't just.

1805
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,760
I want to fix them.
We know a lot of people that try to fix 

1806
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:55,760
them.
Like Bryan County,

1807
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,200
when I first met him,
it was always trying to fix these crazy 

1808
01:17:59,200 --> 01:17:59,200
girls and I was like,
dude,

1809
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,710
you gotta save yourself.
You got to save yourself,

1810
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:01,940
man.
You can't fix someone.

1811
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:07,300
You can't.
I remember the day I decided I would 

1812
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,881
never fix a chick again.
It was a one night stand and I came in 

1813
01:18:09,881 --> 01:18:10,310
like 15 seconds.

1814
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,350
She and I told her,
I said,

1815
01:18:14,351 --> 01:18:16,900
hey,
I came and then I was about to say,

1816
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,490
give me a second.
Let me reboot.

1817
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:21,550
I'm going to go back at it,
but she was on top of me.

1818
01:18:21,551 --> 01:18:23,350
She goes,
are you fucking kidding me?

1819
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:25,300
And she punched the wall.
She goes,

1820
01:18:25,301 --> 01:18:27,250
you got to learn how to,
you got to learn how to fuck,

1821
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,650
you need to read a book and get online 
and learn how to fuck.

1822
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,270
And I gently rolled out of bed and I was
like,

1823
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,890
I think you need to go home.
I was like,

1824
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:36,280
this isn't happening anymore.
And then she was like,

1825
01:18:36,281 --> 01:18:37,540
excuse me?
And I was like,

1826
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:42,990
listen,
I'm not your boyfriend and I'm not your 

1827
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:44,050
fucking husband and what I just saw,
I'm not going to be able to help.

1828
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,510
And she was like,
and then you can see it in her eyes.

1829
01:18:46,511 --> 01:18:48,160
Like I gotta get on a train and go to 
Brooklyn.

1830
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:50,200
She was like getting.
They started getting pissed.

1831
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,410
By the way,
I'm in my kitchen now in New York.

1832
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,780
Condom still on.
I go to the um,

1833
01:18:55,781 --> 01:18:56,820
this is how it tapped out.
I'm,

1834
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:59,350
I go grab a beer out of the refrigerator
still naked,

1835
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:00,880
condom on.
Start drinking a beer.

1836
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:01,450
My roommate,
we,

1837
01:19:01,451 --> 01:19:03,000
Joe walks out and he's like,
what the fuck are you?

1838
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,350
I got it handled.
Don't worry about it.

1839
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,070
Walk her to the fucking door,
walk her to the door,

1840
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:12,880
miss might be the most beautiful moment 
of walking to the door.

1841
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,310
And she's like,
are you fucking serious?

1842
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:18,520
Are you fucking like in my face?
And she goes,

1843
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:19,940
you're pathetic.
You fuck.

1844
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,400
And like tries to humiliate me.
And I go,

1845
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:22,750
listen,
I fucked you.

1846
01:19:22,751 --> 01:19:25,270
And came are one.
And she looks at me.

1847
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:27,070
He goes like this,
it goes like this goes like this.

1848
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:29,450
And I flinched so fucking hard.
I go,

1849
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:36,200
we both start laughing and she,
well we both started laughing 

1850
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,450
immediately and then she just smiles and
goes,

1851
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,480
it's four in the fucking morning in my 
apartment building.

1852
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:43,330
She goes,
Bert Kreischer can't fuck it.

1853
01:19:43,331 --> 01:19:44,920
Starts Banging on doors.
I'm like,

1854
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:46,510
alright,
this is over.

1855
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,180
Take the charge.
What a good catch.

1856
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,770
Keep her number follower on facebook.
Occasionally check in,

1857
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,840
see where she's in jail.

1858
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:02,890
A really great story.
So before I fucked her one night,

1859
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:08,010
uh,
like I jacked off in front of her like 

1860
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,570
the Louis Way.
But like we both match for Louis.

1861
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,300
We both have masturbated in front of 
each other in my apartment.

1862
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:17,610
I think we were doing coke and like 
candles lit and glass of wine and she's 

1863
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:18,330
like,
I just want like,

1864
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:23,410
and it was cool.
It's playful fun and we get done and 

1865
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:23,410
she's like,
Hey,

1866
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:25,110
just so you know,
you can't tell anyone about this.

1867
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:25,870
And I was like,
no,

1868
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:28,740
she knew a bunch of comics in New York.
I go home and say,

1869
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,130
so I want to tell us all.
She's like,

1870
01:20:30,131 --> 01:20:31,320
I promise you,
I swear to God.

1871
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:34,180
Next day you,
everybody that knows.

1872
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,120
Nope.
The next day I'm walking into the Boston

1873
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:38,760
comedy club and rich bosses out smoking 
a cigarette.

1874
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:39,840
I go,
what's up?

1875
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:44,841
And he goes,
did you ever jacked off in front of 

1876
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:44,841
Jennifer?

1877
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:44,841
Last night I was like,
what?

1878
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:45,870
And he goes,
me too.

1879
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:50,900
She needed a ride home from Brooklyn one
time fucking boss.

1880
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,340
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1881
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,500
Yeah.
Oh God.

1882
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,050
Those were the days I lived those.
Would you,

1883
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:03,120
would you,
if you could go back to one point in 

1884
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,061
your standup career for one year,
you got a live one year in your standup 

1885
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:08,361
career.
You can't pick right now where you are 

1886
01:21:08,361 --> 01:21:10,551
right now,
but you've got to go back to one point 

1887
01:21:10,551 --> 01:21:11,700
when one year everyday you show up into 
the store.

1888
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:16,720
[inaudible] 97 when you're meeting 
Orient everyone and you and Duncan 

1889
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,640
Duncan's living on your couch or what?
I don't know what year that was,

1890
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:21,390
but around then or you go to the part.
Where is that?

1891
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:24,990
I mean probably one of the more 
interesting parts is when you get banned

1892
01:21:24,991 --> 01:21:28,770
from the store from them and see a shit 
and you're like literally like fuck it.

1893
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:31,830
Like I'm a man on a mission.
Fuck.

1894
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:36,860
Like that's one of the more interesting 
parts in your story and your life in my 

1895
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:40,050
opinion is when everyone fucking backed 
out on you and you were like,

1896
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,790
no,
I don't go on like that.

1897
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:44,460
Motherfuckers and you just start fucking
building.

1898
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:47,730
What year would you pick?
I would pick the early days.

1899
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:51,450
I pick like when I was just starting to 
get work when I'm in Boston.

1900
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,770
Yeah,
it was like a Middle Act.

1901
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,910
I picked those days doing weird shitty 
road gigs,

1902
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,590
you know,
early twenties.

1903
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,230
Careless.
No,

1904
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,540
no responsibilities.
No worries.

1905
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:07,260
No nothing.
Didn't even have credit card,

1906
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:08,820
had nothing.
Yeah,

1907
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:14,510
those were the good days.
And a lot of ways it's not the today's 

1908
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:17,661
not awesome tastes way better for sure.
But what was good about those days is 

1909
01:22:17,661 --> 01:22:18,030
that there's.
So,

1910
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:21,030
there's so much wild and freeness,
there's so much,

1911
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:27,430
you know,
like I remember one time I did this Gig 

1912
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:28,530
in Maine and then uh,
after the gig he met this girl who had a

1913
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:29,160
couple drinks.

1914
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,990
We're hanging out.
We're both like the same age.

1915
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:35,040
I think I was probably 22,
23.

1916
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:36,810
She's probably somewhere around the same
age,

1917
01:22:36,811 --> 01:22:41,811
22,
23 and we're just young and it's the 

1918
01:22:41,811 --> 01:22:45,210
summertime and we hung out and we wind 
up banging in my car.

1919
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:50,300
I had like a Honda accord and one and we
didn't even go in the back seat because 

1920
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,840
it was really barely a backseat.
Right.

1921
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:56,841
We like folded down the front seat flat 
and then the windows rolled down and 

1922
01:22:56,961 --> 01:22:58,680
we're just sitting there hanging out and
laughing.

1923
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:03,810
And I remember having this unique moment
where I realized like,

1924
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,100
this is not going be my life forever.

1925
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:11,100
I'm never,
I'm not going to be 22 years old with 

1926
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,050
like $100 in the bank,
not knowing what I'm doing,

1927
01:23:14,051 --> 01:23:17,380
not knowing where I'm going,
not knowing what the future holds,

1928
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:22,830
but yet okay with it.
Like you can only be okay with that for 

1929
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:27,061
a certain amount of years.
When you're 45 and you have $100 in the 

1930
01:23:27,061 --> 01:23:31,441
bank and you don't know what you're 
doing and your career is not really 

1931
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:32,020
established.
You don't really have a clear path.

1932
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,300
That's scary.
That's dangerous.

1933
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,920
It feels like you're a loser.
You know,

1934
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:40,921
you feel like you feel pathetic.
You feel like you haven't done what you 

1935
01:23:40,921 --> 01:23:44,161
need to do.
There's like a certain amount of 

1936
01:23:44,161 --> 01:23:45,481
discipline that you haven't taken part 
in and because of that your life is 

1937
01:23:45,481 --> 01:23:49,020
chaotic.
Whereas when you're 22 and that's 

1938
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:49,780
happened in this,
it's like that Bob Seger Song,

1939
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:52,450
you know,
like what was that rambling man?

1940
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:54,220
No,
I'm,

1941
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,800
I don't remember which one.
You know,

1942
01:23:58,801 --> 01:24:00,360
he's got a lot of songs about that 
movie.

1943
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:02,490
He was like a rock.
Maybe it's night moves,

1944
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,880
but the idea of that you're recognizing 
that this is a unique moment in your 

1945
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:12,870
youth that it's all like,
who knows what can happen.

1946
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,090
I mean,
he might die in a car accident tomorrow.

1947
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:17,910
Who knows?
You might never make it as a comedian.

1948
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,300
You might take a job somewhere and you 
might always have regret,

1949
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:23,270
but right now you're having fun.
Right now you're,

1950
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:28,370
you're basically just a couple of years 
out of high school and you know you're 

1951
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,930
in,
you did a comedy Gig and now you meet in

1952
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:37,940
some pretty girl and you guys are 
laughing and hanging out and you having 

1953
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:41,151
a good time and it's summer and the 
windows rolled down and the air is warm 

1954
01:24:41,581 --> 01:24:45,210
and it's just something.
It was something amazing about it.

1955
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:49,500
Those days were fascinating.
Men and Greg and I fitzsimmons and I did

1956
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:54,501
a shit ton of gigs together.
We worked together a lot back in those 

1957
01:24:54,501 --> 01:24:56,280
days because we started out within a 
week of each other.

1958
01:24:56,850 --> 01:25:00,750
We were open mic or is it the exact same
time and we did a ton of gigs together.

1959
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:01,650
Yeah,
we basically,

1960
01:25:01,651 --> 01:25:05,880
we traveled all over the place together.
We did a lot of gigs in Rhode Island and

1961
01:25:05,881 --> 01:25:09,300
all over the place,
all the Massachusetts hell gigs.

1962
01:25:09,301 --> 01:25:11,940
We did all those things together and 
what we,

1963
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:15,720
we still do this day.
We'll look back and laugh at those days.

1964
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:16,500
Hey,
uh,

1965
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:19,860
Jamie,
I'm Gerard Carmichael.

1966
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,050
Is that the wrong spot?
Tell Jeff to get on the ball.

1967
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:23,860
Um,

1968
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:27,860
those days were,
they're just,

1969
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:31,130
they're just really unique in that you 
really have no idea.

1970
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:36,490
You have no idea.
You have no idea what the fuck the 

1971
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:36,790
future holds.
It's a completely different experience.

1972
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:41,791
You like your life is a completely 
different experience than it will ever 

1973
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:43,550
be ever again.
And I just remember that.

1974
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:48,610
I remember that moment.
I don't know why it's at one night with 

1975
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:51,110
one girl that I never talked to again 
now because back then you'd have to call

1976
01:25:51,111 --> 01:25:53,840
someone.
They'd have to be home like in,

1977
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:56,360
in 1990.
That'd be home.

1978
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:01,720
Yeah.
You call them on the phone if they 

1979
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:01,720
weren't home and be like,
well,

1980
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:01,720
I guess they're not home.
You know,

1981
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,310
it's like it wasn't,
it wasn't like today,

1982
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:09,610
you know,
you can text someone or you can email 

1983
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:09,890
them or nope,
you had to call them at their house.

1984
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:12,800
There's a few of those,
few of those that are a member.

1985
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,000
Yeah.
You know?

1986
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:20,360
Yeah.
Those are the idea that you didn't have 

1987
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,981
phones.
I remember road trips with Tom and we 

1988
01:26:22,981 --> 01:26:24,250
just would talk for fucking hours.
Right hours.

1989
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:25,440
We've talked to a whole.
We talked,

1990
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:28,330
we drove to Sacramento one time,
talked for five hours there.

1991
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:29,350
Five hours,
10 hours.

1992
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,240
You spend with a human being.
No one's on their phones.

1993
01:26:31,241 --> 01:26:34,750
Yeah.
There's something real about that.

1994
01:26:34,751 --> 01:26:39,751
Right?
I think we're definitely missing 

1995
01:26:39,751 --> 01:26:41,911
something.
Definitely missing something with these 

1996
01:26:41,911 --> 01:26:42,550
phones,
but they were gaining something to where

1997
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,740
we're gaining a lot more information.
I'll tell you what,

1998
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:48,640
my kids haven't lived anyone on fire.
Like we did that when we were kids.

1999
01:26:48,641 --> 01:26:53,641
There's no phones.
We a kid on fire one time just because 

2000
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:53,641
we were bored.
Yeah,

2001
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,050
yeah,
yeah.

2002
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,840
I don't know man.
There's good and bad.

2003
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:04,020
It's like it balances out I guess,
but if you had to go back to anytime in 

2004
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:04,020
your comedy career,
when would you go?

2005
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,670
When I just want to write.
When I first started headlining,

2006
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,120
like right when,
like that first time I just had kids,

2007
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:15,450
they were young.
I was making 1300 bucks a week on the 

2008
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:16,580
road and I was so passionate about 
standup.

2009
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:18,490
I was kind of pretty hacky.
I bet.

2010
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:23,730
But like I just would give everything 
every night they do a six shows Thursday

2011
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:29,791
through Sunday and I'd fly in early for 
press and I get excited to do press and 

2012
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:34,081
I come in and I just be like.
And I have my notebook with me all the 

2013
01:27:34,081 --> 01:27:34,081
time and I was like,
I just,

2014
01:27:34,081 --> 01:27:36,400
every idea was like a brand new field.
Like you felt like you were really.

2015
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:41,600
It was not like you just discovered the 
internet and every page had so much to 

2016
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:41,600
offer.
And then.

2017
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,230
And then I think I got into when I got,
oddly enough,

2018
01:27:44,231 --> 01:27:47,830
when I got into travel channel stuff,
I kinda just to Kinda,

2019
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:52,360
it Kinda took a second backseat and I,
because I was headlining and I was like,

2020
01:27:52,361 --> 01:27:52,650
yeah,
yeah,

2021
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,800
I can do this competently.

2022
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:59,160
And I think I'm there now.
Like right now I feel like I'm back to 

2023
01:27:59,160 --> 01:27:59,160
this place where I go.
Like,

2024
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,480
I'm just writing so fucking much where 
I'm like,

2025
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,580
Oh God,
like everything.

2026
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:08,680
Like I feel like everything.
That's the thing that happens when you 

2027
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,710
have to do a special every couple years 
when you,

2028
01:28:09,711 --> 01:28:12,940
when you're filming,
the one thing that definitely happens is

2029
01:28:12,941 --> 01:28:16,090
you're forced into this creativity.
You're forced to.

2030
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,970
Whereas we're both aware of those people
that don't.

2031
01:28:18,971 --> 01:28:20,140
Right.
And they,

2032
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:25,190
they,
they sit around for a long time but the 

2033
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:27,301
same material and then it goes year 
after year after year and then it gets 

2034
01:28:27,301 --> 01:28:29,830
stale or,
and staler and flatter and other kind of

2035
01:28:29,831 --> 01:28:31,900
people that write the exact same job 
next year,

2036
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:34,210
their hours,
the same hour.

2037
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:35,860
It's just,
just say it differently.

2038
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:40,660
For me.
I took this hour so fucking seriously,

2039
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,480
I took it like I was saying to someone 
the other day,

2040
01:28:43,481 --> 01:28:45,280
I did a hundred and 50 sets.

2041
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:50,310
I performed that our 150 times before I 
did it on Netflix or before I did it in 

2042
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:52,210
the truck.
I did it a hundred and 50 times.

2043
01:28:52,211 --> 01:28:52,990
I do the math.
I went,

2044
01:28:53,290 --> 01:28:53,800
wow man.
I,

2045
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:56,530
I like.
And I arranged it like that,

2046
01:28:56,531 --> 01:29:01,531
working in our and figuring out where to
play stuff and figuring out why we're 

2047
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:02,910
stuffs you go of.
I'm obsessive about that.

2048
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:05,210
Where'd you film at the Trocadero?
Uh,

2049
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,780
night two shows.
It was fucking,

2050
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:09,660
it was.
I mean the second show was a dream.

2051
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,720
That's a great spot.
I lowered the stage so that I'm in the 

2052
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:14,720
audience.
I put a half moon in there.

2053
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:17,130
So it wasn't just a little plank,
no smoke machine.

2054
01:29:17,131 --> 01:29:19,470
I'd seen everyone had smoke machines.
I didn't want a smoke machine.

2055
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:24,740
And I think it really paid off.
This sounds silly and you won't notice 

2056
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,700
this when you watched your special,
but because that place is so old,

2057
01:29:26,701 --> 01:29:30,360
there's little particles of dust 
everywhere and you can almost see him in

2058
01:29:30,361 --> 01:29:30,660
the back.

2059
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,550
It looks like it's like little stars in 
the back.

2060
01:29:32,551 --> 01:29:34,770
I love it.
I love because of dust.

2061
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:35,280
Really?
Yeah,

2062
01:29:35,281 --> 01:29:37,650
it looks bad ass.
It looks fucking bad ass.

2063
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:41,010
What is your writing process like?
Do you write stuff out on paper?

2064
01:29:41,011 --> 01:29:42,780
Do you write it on a computer?
How do you do it?

2065
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:48,010
I write it.
I don't sit and longhand anything 

2066
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:48,110
anymore because it just,
it.

2067
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,490
I end up losing so much.
I just,

2068
01:29:50,491 --> 01:29:53,370
it just doesn't help.
So what I do is if I see something or if

2069
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:55,890
something happens,
it's usually something happens to me and

2070
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:56,340
then I go,
oh,

2071
01:29:56,341 --> 01:30:01,341
that's the bit and I'll write it in my 
phone and I'll just put it in my phone 

2072
01:30:01,341 --> 01:30:04,520
or I'll write and I'll also write it in 
my book because I bring my book with me 

2073
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,720
on stage and I'll go to my book and I'll
see the one more thing and I,

2074
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:10,860
and I say I tell stories and I know I'm 
known for telling like 12 minute 

2075
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:12,840
stories,
but like most of my stories are a little

2076
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:15,330
tighter now and what I'm writing is a 
little tighter.

2077
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:18,360
So I kind of work it out on stage 
mostly.

2078
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:22,040
But I record every set.
I think go through the recording,

2079
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:27,050
Scott,
right in a lot on stage and I'll write 

2080
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:27,050
down all like,
fuck,

2081
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:27,330
that's funny.
Like even stupid silly lines.

2082
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:30,000
And,
and so that's the part where I.

2083
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:30,900
and then,
and then,

2084
01:30:30,901 --> 01:30:32,070
uh,
once I get it like that,

2085
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:37,610
then I just,
then I recorded again and I find the 

2086
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:38,850
parts where the silences or where I'm 
lazy,

2087
01:30:38,970 --> 01:30:39,540
where I go,
oh,

2088
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:41,830
I need something.
I can't just go suck my Dick.

2089
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:44,460
And that's the punchline.
But yeah,

2090
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:45,900
I record it,
I write it,

2091
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:48,690
but I don't long hand write it.
I just had worked for me.

2092
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:50,850
So when you say you write it,
like how you're writing it,

2093
01:30:50,851 --> 01:30:53,360
you just writing like bullet points?
Uh,

2094
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:54,330
yeah.
So I'll write,

2095
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:56,940
I'll write bullet points.
I'm like,

2096
01:30:56,941 --> 01:30:57,540
I'm trying to think of.

2097
01:30:57,630 --> 01:31:02,630
Okay.
So like I have the joke at my best joke 

2098
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:02,630
I'm telling you right now without a 
doubt is about,

2099
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:05,850
it's kind of about you,
but it's not about you at all.

2100
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:11,120
But the opening thing was just some.
The only part I'll tell you is I went 

2101
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:15,131
into a starbucks and I thought I was 
getting recognized and the young black 

2102
01:31:15,131 --> 01:31:15,131
kid behind the counter came up to me.
He's like,

2103
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:16,170
dude,
like,

2104
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:16,980
oh my God.
And I'm like,

2105
01:31:16,981 --> 01:31:17,760
yeah.
And he's like,

2106
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:20,850
I'm a huge fan of Joe Rogan's.
I was like,

2107
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:26,030
oh,
and so then so then me and him had an 

2108
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,840
interaction and I made them laugh and I 
went,

2109
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,130
oh,
that was funny.

2110
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:33,360
So then the next day I came back and I 
made them laugh again and I went,

2111
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,640
oh,
I know where this is.

2112
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:38,300
So then I ride it out and I figured out 
and then I,

2113
01:31:38,301 --> 01:31:39,330
and then I,
the next,

2114
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,370
that other interaction was so big I 
realized,

2115
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:42,630
oh,
I need three of those,

2116
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:44,280
so then I'll,
I'll punch it out.

2117
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:49,280
But I and I and I find the things that 
make it rhythmic and the things like for

2118
01:31:49,831 --> 01:31:54,831
me,
things that catch and audiences like I 

2119
01:31:54,831 --> 01:31:55,430
go and then he fell down and then when 
he the moment said something,

2120
01:31:55,470 --> 01:32:00,470
he gets up,
leans up like it's almost the rhythm of 

2121
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:01,450
the way they say it for me before,
along with the joke,

2122
01:32:01,451 --> 01:32:03,160
if that makes any sense.
The case,

2123
01:32:03,161 --> 01:32:04,740
like if someone's a really good 
storyteller,

2124
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:06,310
it's like there's a whole thing going 
on,

2125
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:09,610
that physical thing going on.
There's a rhythm thing going on.

2126
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:14,820
Like Stan hope is really good at rhythm.
Like when jokes he says like it's easier

2127
01:32:15,131 --> 01:32:18,010
for me to talk about Stan hope then 
about myself,

2128
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:23,460
but like when he goes,
when he's talking about Isis and how 

2129
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,040
they recruit people and it's identical 
to how he recruits people.

2130
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:27,540
He goes,
Isis,

2131
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:31,990
I'm working this corner.
Like that phrasing a good phrase for me.

2132
01:32:31,991 --> 01:32:35,150
Bird does it.
Amazingly bird does it amazingly.

2133
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:37,690
What does he say?
He does it similar to isis.

2134
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,850
The they were,
he was watching a video.

2135
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:43,000
This is on his special,
so I'm not putting any jokes out.

2136
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:48,030
This is on a fast special.
He talks about how isis goes online and 

2137
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:52,801
finds like pathetic young men who can't 
get laid and have drinking and drug 

2138
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:57,180
problems and then they bring them in and
they show them a good time and they get 

2139
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:57,840
them drunk and he's like,
that's,

2140
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,120
that's how I recruit people and if the 
line is so great,

2141
01:33:01,121 --> 01:33:03,040
he's like Isis.
I'm working this corner.

2142
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:08,430
Such a great old barker's technique.
He's got the weirdest fucking life ever.

2143
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:14,380
I mean he's basically,
we got a little cult going on and he 

2144
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,960
wants to do sober October.
Come on.

2145
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:17,260
Yup.

2146
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:19,500
Yoga classes,
yeah,

2147
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,920
you should make them.
We should run a house for him in La.

2148
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:24,750
Yeah,
so we give them incentive to come here.

2149
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:26,610
I've been trying to get on to move back 
here forever.

2150
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,680
I'm like,
what are you doing with your little cult

2151
01:33:28,681 --> 01:33:30,030
down there,
man?

2152
01:33:30,031 --> 01:33:35,031
Come hang out at the store because he 
hung out at the store a couple of 

2153
01:33:35,031 --> 01:33:35,031
nights.
He's like,

2154
01:33:35,031 --> 01:33:35,070
it's a place is incredible.
It's amazing.

2155
01:33:35,071 --> 01:33:35,970
I go,
it's amazing.

2156
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,530
I go,
this is a Valhalla.

2157
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:42,860
This is the craziest.
Like it in terms of what I've 

2158
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:46,440
experienced is a crazy era of standup 
ever and the store is the epicenter.

2159
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:48,330
I'm like,
you should be here all the time.

2160
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:49,890
He's like,
ah,

2161
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:54,980
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know your 

2162
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:54,980
Doug fucking Stan hope get in here,
man.

2163
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:56,190
Could go just get an apartment near 
here.

2164
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,770
It'd be great if he was here for all 
October.

2165
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,330
God,
we can just talk them into staying.

2166
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:05,360
I'm like,
why don't you get a place here and 

2167
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,921
there.
You were a wealthy man of leisure to 

2168
01:34:06,921 --> 01:34:06,921
whatever you want.

2169
01:34:06,921 --> 01:34:09,810
He is he.
I called him up one morning or one 

2170
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:09,810
night,
it's like 5:00

2171
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,170
at night and I was like,
bullshit.

2172
01:34:11,171 --> 01:34:12,100
And I go,
which up to,

2173
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:14,650
and this is why I love Doug.
He goes,

2174
01:34:14,651 --> 01:34:18,040
I'm having a grapefruit and vodka having
a cigarette,

2175
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:19,330
trying to think of some goofs.

2176
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:21,690
Okay.

2177
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:25,640
I'm trying to rework a,
a knock knock jokes.

2178
01:34:25,641 --> 01:34:28,390
I'm trying to make knock knock jokes 
present like a,

2179
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:33,650
well let me run by you.
And he tells me like his version of a 

2180
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:33,650
knock knock joke and it's so fucking 
funny.

2181
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:35,040
And I go,
I go talk to you.

2182
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:35,430
It's like,
oh,

2183
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:40,480
49,
50 and go and you're just sitting in 

2184
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:40,480
your pajamas right in groups.
He goes,

2185
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,540
that's our life.
I was like,

2186
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:42,800
fuck,
yes.

2187
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,180
Yeah,
that's his life.

2188
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:46,760
My daughters will see me doing it where 
I'm like,

2189
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:49,680
we're out to dinner is something will 
happen and I'll just be like,

2190
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,050
like mouthing to myself and I'm working 
the bit.

2191
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,070
Yeah.
And they're like,

2192
01:34:55,071 --> 01:34:56,390
are you writing a joke right now?
And I'm like,

2193
01:34:56,391 --> 01:34:56,990
yeah,
sorry.

2194
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:58,130
I get up and run.

2195
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:01,010
I get out of the room right back,
right back,

2196
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,120
right back.
Oh really?

2197
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:03,140
Leaves me alone.
Yeah,

2198
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:08,640
no,
I have an idea if I have an idea and 

2199
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:08,640
anybody gets in there the little,
the ideal escape,

2200
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,580
it'll slip away.
Like if I have an idea,

2201
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:15,610
especially kids like young kids,
they just start talking like they just 

2202
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:19,811
start and then they demand your 
attention and like you have to for to 

2203
01:35:19,811 --> 01:35:21,080
capture a bit,
you have to have silence.

2204
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:26,440
Like you can have people talking at you 
or you consider what they're saying 

2205
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:26,440
like,
Oh really?

2206
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:30,280
Yeah.
And then what was I just thinking of 

2207
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:30,280
Shit.
It'll go away.

2208
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:33,640
Yeah.
So I treat those things like they're 

2209
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,831
gold,
like if I have an idea and it's a real 

2210
01:35:35,831 --> 01:35:35,831
idea,
like a real idea where I get excited,

2211
01:35:35,831 --> 01:35:36,320
I'm like,
Oh shit,

2212
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:38,030
I run,
I get up,

2213
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:39,710
I get up off the table right back,
right back,

2214
01:35:39,711 --> 01:35:40,640
got to go,
I've got an idea.

2215
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:46,270
And you know,
people were not into that and don't get 

2216
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:48,290
creativity and don't write or don't do 
standup up.

2217
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:49,910
It'll weird amount.
Oh yeah.

2218
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,520
And you have to come back and apologize 
like,

2219
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:54,290
sorry,
I just had an idea and how to capture it

2220
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,420
in the moment.
I just have to write it down.

2221
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,070
I'll show it to them on my phone,
like,

2222
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:58,250
look.

2223
01:35:58,510 --> 01:35:58,810
Right.
Oh,

2224
01:35:58,811 --> 01:36:00,250
I'm a daydreamer.
I literally,

2225
01:36:00,251 --> 01:36:05,251
I literally will sit and just talk in 
the middle of dinner with my family and 

2226
01:36:05,251 --> 01:36:05,251
just talk something out.
Just be like.

2227
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:08,050
So you can hold it while you're talking 
to them about other shit.

2228
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:08,800
Oh,
I don't know.

2229
01:36:08,801 --> 01:36:10,630
I'm tapped everyone out.
I tap everyone out.

2230
01:36:10,631 --> 01:36:11,710
I tell them I,
you uber drivers.

2231
01:36:11,711 --> 01:36:12,670
Hey man,
I'm not crazy.

2232
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:15,520
I'm a comic and I just sit and I'll work
a bit out like this.

2233
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:20,550
Like,
like I got high as fuck the other night 

2234
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:22,240
I got high.
I got high as fuck the other night.

2235
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:27,270
This is my,
this is before the triathlon because I 

2236
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,270
wasn't smoking pot up and,
or no,

2237
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:28,000
no,
it was before the triathlon.

2238
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,910
I walked in and uh,
I walked in the house.

2239
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:35,911
I was way too high.
I was coming back from the store I 

2240
01:36:35,911 --> 01:36:35,911
guess.

2241
01:36:35,911 --> 01:36:39,180
And uh,
I walk in the kitchen and my bull 

2242
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:41,590
mastiff is putting away the silverware.
What?

2243
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:45,010
Yeah,
she's got elbow on the counter,

2244
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,370
putting away the silverware,
putting away a silverware.

2245
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,500
That's what I said.
And she looks at me like,

2246
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,050
are you gonna fucking help?
And then I realized,

2247
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,880
oh,
she's eating a cake on the calendar,

2248
01:36:55,090 --> 01:37:00,090
but I was so high and then the dog was 
eating a cake on the counter just up 

2249
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:03,990
with hand stabilizing and just going.
And I started laughing so hard that my 

2250
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:05,320
brain thought it was similar that I was 
like,

2251
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:10,380
oh,
I walked right out to the man cave and 

2252
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:10,380
Joe,
I must've stood there for an hour trying

2253
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:10,380
to write that bit.
Like,

2254
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,850
just going.
When did you take the cake away from the

2255
01:37:12,851 --> 01:37:13,250
dog?
Yeah,

2256
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:13,600
yeah,
yeah,

2257
01:37:13,601 --> 01:37:14,560
yeah.
It was a coffee cake.

2258
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,500
It was a coffee cake.

2259
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:20,510
We were fine actually.
I went up and helped read it a little 

2260
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:20,510
bit.
She looked at me and she was like,

2261
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:20,510
we're doing this together.
I was like,

2262
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:21,100
yeah,
we're running a train bitch.

2263
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:26,460
And so.
But I went into the man cave and I just 

2264
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,260
was talking to my wife,
came back and I'm standing in the man 

2265
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:28,500
cave just going like,
just hands moving.

2266
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:29,700
Like I was like,
oh.

2267
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,870
I walked in and she's like,
my wife's like,

2268
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:33,550
are,
are you going to bed?

2269
01:37:33,551 --> 01:37:34,210
And I was like,
I'm sorry,

2270
01:37:34,211 --> 01:37:35,570
I'm in the middle of a bit.
She's like,

2271
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:36,970
all right.
He just left.

2272
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:38,650
Yeah,
I'll jump up in the middle of the night.

2273
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:41,740
I have a bit and it's in my head and I'm
in bed.

2274
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:43,510
I've,
I've said to myself before,

2275
01:37:43,511 --> 01:37:48,460
I'll remember that and I never remember 
ever,

2276
01:37:48,490 --> 01:37:50,230
never.
Occasionally,

2277
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:53,710
one out of 100 times I'll be like taking
a leak and I'll go,

2278
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:55,800
oh yeah.
And I'll remember it.

2279
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:56,020
Yeah.

2280
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:57,900
Those,
those jokes are slippery.

2281
01:37:57,901 --> 01:38:02,901
Like Neal Brennan said it best.
He said that he thinks of his notebook 

2282
01:38:02,901 --> 01:38:04,470
as like a,
a net for catching ideas.

2283
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:06,450
My Ooh,
I like that.

2284
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:08,220
Yeah.
That's a good way of looking at it.

2285
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:13,400
You gotta have you gotTa have something 
on you at all times because something 

2286
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:13,470
happens all the time where you're like,
well,

2287
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:18,471
the phone is the best man.
I don't know if you use the dictation 

2288
01:38:18,471 --> 01:38:18,570
feature.
Never do that one ever listened to it?

2289
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:19,140
No,
no,

2290
01:38:19,141 --> 01:38:19,770
no.
Uh,

2291
01:38:19,771 --> 01:38:20,640
with notes.
Oh yeah,

2292
01:38:20,641 --> 01:38:20,930
yeah,
yeah,

2293
01:38:20,931 --> 01:38:22,440
yeah.
Just talk and it'll,

2294
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:25,890
it'll uh,
voice to text on the plane last night,

2295
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:31,130
uh,
or wherever I was yesterday night I was 

2296
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:33,741
trying to type in white supremacist and 
it came up white Supreme Hoodie and I 

2297
01:38:35,611 --> 01:38:36,120
thought,
oh,

2298
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:39,110
that's funny that you'd try to like,
I wanted,

2299
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:41,400
I ordered in a white supremacist totally
on accident.

2300
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,830
So then usually I just,
there's nothing to it right now,

2301
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:45,090
but I wrote it and I go,
all right,

2302
01:38:45,091 --> 01:38:46,710
well we got that in the pocket.
Yeah,

2303
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:48,390
I got them all.
You never know.

2304
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,770
White the fuck up.
I just heard someone say that have,

2305
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:53,490
I have hundreds of them that never did 
anything.

2306
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:57,420
So I'll go over through them.
Like sometimes if I'm stale I'll just go

2307
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,680
scrolling through them.
I go,

2308
01:38:58,681 --> 01:39:00,030
what do I got here?
What do I got in here?

2309
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:01,470
What do I got here?
Oh yeah.

2310
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:03,960
I never tried that.
And one of those I never tried.

2311
01:39:03,961 --> 01:39:08,961
I tried last night,
the Ice House Ice House and there's 

2312
01:39:08,961 --> 01:39:08,961
something there.
There's something there.

2313
01:39:08,961 --> 01:39:13,690
It's not good yet,
but it's a seed or something there and 

2314
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:16,370
you got to water those seeds and you 
gotta take chances with them and you got

2315
01:39:16,371 --> 01:39:21,371
to know how many of those dud seeds you 
can plant in a set while people are 

2316
01:39:21,371 --> 01:39:21,630
sitting there paying attention.

2317
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,240
Like you got to give them real bits too 
bro.

2318
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:27,330
But you gotta also have like last night 
anybody came to the show.

2319
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,700
I hope you have a good time,
but I had a four.

2320
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,300
At least four solid duds in there.
I'm just trying.

2321
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:36,030
I don't know where I'm going with.
Um,

2322
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:37,500
and then I go places.
I'm like,

2323
01:39:37,501 --> 01:39:38,760
Jesus,
what are you even saying?

2324
01:39:38,761 --> 01:39:42,960
Like so extreme that I,
I will go at the end of my.

2325
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:45,390
So like I'll work everything that's 
working.

2326
01:39:45,710 --> 01:39:49,950
Like right now I got about 52 new 
minutes and so everything that.

2327
01:39:49,951 --> 01:39:54,951
Damn,
that was quick when from when I shot my 

2328
01:39:54,951 --> 01:39:54,951
special.
How many months ago?

2329
01:39:54,951 --> 01:39:56,430
Shot in February.
Wow.

2330
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,890
Yeah,
I got 52 minutes now that I am.

2331
01:39:58,950 --> 01:40:01,590
Why are they spending that much time 
before they show it?

2332
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:05,310
I don't know.
That's a long ass time.

2333
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:06,720
February,
March,

2334
01:40:06,721 --> 01:40:07,260
April,
May,

2335
01:40:07,261 --> 01:40:07,760
June,
July,

2336
01:40:07,761 --> 01:40:08,520
August,
August,

2337
01:40:08,521 --> 01:40:09,660
six months I guess.

2338
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:10,640
That's right.
Yeah.

2339
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,520
Lives was a little shorter but not much 
but just like a month maybe.

2340
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:17,720
We shot on the same day and so like,
uh,

2341
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:20,190
that's great though that you already 
have 50 minutes.

2342
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:21,120
I do.
I just,

2343
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:22,920
I'm back.
Like I'm just in it.

2344
01:40:22,921 --> 01:40:24,360
I like it.
I'm from where I'm at.

2345
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:30,300
It's also my thing.
It's like the only thing I got that's 

2346
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:30,300
what's making me money.
So yeah,

2347
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,300
that's where my eggs are so much better 
than working for the travel channel.

2348
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:36,000
You have no fucking.
I remember when you were doing it,

2349
01:40:36,001 --> 01:40:36,950
I was telling you like,
Bert,

2350
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,190
you're a funny guy,
man.

2351
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,140
You,
you,

2352
01:40:39,141 --> 01:40:41,700
you could be making a living doing 
comedy and not.

2353
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:44,730
Not having these bosses and be on 
rollercoasters every weekend.

2354
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,780
Biting your tongue.
Remember,

2355
01:40:45,781 --> 01:40:50,781
I used to smoke weed in here and you 
guys have to move the cameras to hide 

2356
01:40:50,781 --> 01:40:51,540
the weed.
You don't remember that God.

2357
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:56,541
That was so crazy.
But that's what happens with one of 

2358
01:40:56,541 --> 01:40:56,541
those gigs.

2359
01:40:56,541 --> 01:40:56,860
Yeah.
Howie Mendell went on stage at the laugh

2360
01:40:56,861 --> 01:41:01,660
factory once and he was talking about 
how scared he was that uh,

2361
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:06,810
he could say something on stage and 
someone could tell his bosses because he

2362
01:41:06,971 --> 01:41:09,940
does a family show and then he could get
fired.

2363
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:12,640
And I was like,
wow,

2364
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:16,330
like you're a comic.
Like he's Howie Mendell dude.

2365
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:21,331
When I was just coming up just starting,
he already had specials and they were 

2366
01:41:22,001 --> 01:41:26,290
really funny.
He was really fucking funny back then,

2367
01:41:26,291 --> 01:41:28,660
man,
back in the day,

2368
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:32,680
some of his early CD's.
Really hilarious shit.

2369
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:35,080
But,
and he's still funny.

2370
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:37,570
Let me still a funny guy.
He's always gonna be a funny guy.

2371
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:40,420
But when I was watching them say that,
I was like,

2372
01:41:40,421 --> 01:41:42,250
that is the craziest thing I've ever 
heard.

2373
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:45,730
He's worried about getting fired for 
saying something on stage,

2374
01:41:45,731 --> 01:41:50,731
like saying fuck in his act or talking 
about something in his act that someone 

2375
01:41:50,731 --> 01:41:54,600
deems to inappropriate for a family show
and he can lose this gig.

2376
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,010
Like America's got.
It was the on America's got talent.

2377
01:41:57,011 --> 01:42:00,580
Is that what is on the wall or something
imagined wanting that Gig?

2378
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:02,280
I can't.
I can't.

2379
01:42:02,281 --> 01:42:05,280
I traveled channel.
I mean I'm not gonna travel channel came

2380
01:42:05,281 --> 01:42:08,940
back very recently and asked me if I'd 
come back and they're like,

2381
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:10,230
what?
It tells us whatever you want to do.

2382
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,420
And part of me was like,
I think I'm doing it.

2383
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:15,960
Like I have a Netflix special and my 
podcast,

2384
01:42:15,961 --> 01:42:18,060
I have a solo podcast.
I've got somethings burning.

2385
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:20,310
I was on the road doing stand up.
Oh yeah.

2386
01:42:20,311 --> 01:42:22,110
I love writing.
I mean I'm writing,

2387
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:27,170
I'm writing faster and better now than 
I've ever written and this special.

2388
01:42:27,661 --> 01:42:30,930
I mean the best compliment I've ever 
gotten is tom watched it and was like,

2389
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:34,220
I had tears in my eyes and then you,
you,

2390
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,310
you,
it's not,

2391
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:37,500
this is you,
it's who you are.

2392
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:39,810
And I was like,
I was like,

2393
01:42:39,811 --> 01:42:41,270
man,
fucking I,

2394
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:43,110
I wish you worked for the New York 
fucking time.

2395
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:44,970
So that is the greatest comment.

2396
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:46,710
But yeah,
like what am I going to.

2397
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:48,900
I mean I talked to Jamie about it after 
that was like,

2398
01:42:48,901 --> 01:42:50,730
I wouldn't,
I don't mind shooting content,

2399
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:53,070
making free content,
putting it out on my own watch,

2400
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:56,640
like going to swim with the orcas in 
Norway and me shooting.

2401
01:42:56,641 --> 01:43:01,641
Yeah.
And doing it me and you go and spear 

2402
01:43:01,641 --> 01:43:03,030
fishing in Miami and covering it and 
shoot it and editing it so that it's bad

2403
01:43:03,031 --> 01:43:05,540
ass music and,
and I don't even care if it's monetized,

2404
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:07,230
but it's something that people watch it 
like fuck,

2405
01:43:07,231 --> 01:43:09,420
that's bad ass.
You don't mind doing any of that,

2406
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:14,750
but to do something with someone else.
Giving me notes and telling me how I 

2407
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:14,750
should behave.
Well not only that,

2408
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:17,280
the travel channel's super conservative,
right?

2409
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:20,790
Well they got bought by discovery so 
they're loosening up a law.

2410
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:23,750
Aren't they owned by like some Christian
work or something?

2411
01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:26,970
The previous owners were scripts and 
they were very faith based,

2412
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:28,980
faith based.
And so like,

2413
01:43:28,981 --> 01:43:29,940
uh,
you know,

2414
01:43:29,941 --> 01:43:34,941
I think that's filet,
they're owned by chick fil a fuck man.

2415
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:37,470
So yeah,
it's nice to know that you go,

2416
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:43,130
like you say something fucked up on 
stage and you're only repercussion is 

2417
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:43,800
the one chick that's like,
that was fucked up and you're like,

2418
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:44,310
yeah,
I know.

2419
01:43:44,311 --> 01:43:45,750
I took a chance.
I rolled the dice,

2420
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,180
kind of know what I was saying before I 
said it.

2421
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:54,630
No,
it's beautiful to you working so hard 

2422
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:54,890
and getting things done and also doing 
that with like,

2423
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:58,520
you're,
you're running and the marathons and the

2424
01:43:58,521 --> 01:44:00,530
Spartan race shit.
Like you're a,

2425
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,570
you're fucking doing shit man.
You're,

2426
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:04,640
you're getting after it.
It's great man.

2427
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:06,340
It's great to see,
you know,

2428
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:09,200
it's great to see you put together this 
special and work so hard at it.

2429
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:10,180
You know,
it's great.

2430
01:44:10,230 --> 01:44:12,890
I mean we're in a real cool time right 
now.

2431
01:44:12,891 --> 01:44:15,200
Like everybody's kind of killing it.
I think.

2432
01:44:15,201 --> 01:44:18,560
So I look at what everyone's doing and 
neural doing it on their own pace.

2433
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:19,630
Oh,
it's awesome.

2434
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:24,640
Like you look at Ari and he's like,
he's like texting me in big J and 

2435
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:24,640
Sally's like,
Yo,

2436
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,110
you guys want to go skiing and do a show
to pay for it?

2437
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,250
And then we're all like,
yeah.

2438
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:29,200
He's like,
all right,

2439
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,140
these are the dates.

2440
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:36,430
Just so you know,
we will be watching the super bowl 

2441
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:37,130
together.
Now he's killing it in his own way.

2442
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,830
You know,
everybody's killing it in their own way.

2443
01:44:39,831 --> 01:44:41,360
It's really fascinating.
It's,

2444
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:42,620
it's,
it's interesting,

2445
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:45,000
you know,
it's true autonomy.

2446
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:45,670
It's what,
you know,

2447
01:44:45,671 --> 01:44:46,350
it's like,
no,

2448
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:49,730
we all started doing this podcast with 
you and showing up at your house.

2449
01:44:50,210 --> 01:44:52,190
The little things we'd see.
We'd be like,

2450
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:54,890
oh,
like I remember Tom was saying something

2451
01:44:54,891 --> 01:44:56,390
about.
I remember sitting on that couch.

2452
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,730
Yeah,
he's still on the couch.

2453
01:44:57,731 --> 01:45:01,490
She's be back in it and you'd be like 
sunken and highest terrible,

2454
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:07,150
terrible couch for doing podcasts.
That was [inaudible] couch at his house 

2455
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:07,400
for a really long time.
Yeah,

2456
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:08,920
I gave it to him.
Yeah,

2457
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:10,860
I've started,
got it out of my podcast studio.

2458
01:45:10,861 --> 01:45:15,861
Uh,
I had shipped over to Ari and then he 

2459
01:45:15,861 --> 01:45:15,861
used it as his couch.

2460
01:45:15,861 --> 01:45:18,590
And then I think he sold it online,
really sold it online.

2461
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:23,591
Right.
There's parts of that old podcast I 

2462
01:45:23,591 --> 01:45:26,851
missed.
You remember your landline would ring 

2463
01:45:26,851 --> 01:45:26,851
all the time.
I love that.

2464
01:45:26,851 --> 01:45:27,380
How about my kids when they were real 
little,

2465
01:45:27,381 --> 01:45:29,600
when they were like two,
they'd be screaming in the background,

2466
01:45:29,601 --> 01:45:34,601
like someone would stub their toe and 
they'd be crying and you would hear in 

2467
01:45:34,601 --> 01:45:35,930
the background.
That was an evolution one fucking time.

2468
01:45:35,931 --> 01:45:39,380
And I had a lot of people come to my 
house though and it was weird,

2469
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:43,100
like it was cool with like Bourdain was 
over or you know,

2470
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:48,400
Jim Jeffries is over.
But every now and then I'd have someone 

2471
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:48,400
over.
I'd be like,

2472
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,440
I don't even know if I liked this guy in
my house for some fucking Weirdo who I 

2473
01:45:51,501 --> 01:45:54,530
brought on the podcast and now they've 
been to my house.

2474
01:45:54,531 --> 01:45:55,520
It's like she was too intimate.

2475
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:00,640
I just want my podcast is still at my 
house and we're talking about a Tom's 

2476
01:46:01,281 --> 01:46:02,710
doing it.
He's like,

2477
01:46:02,711 --> 01:46:07,711
you know,
I can't just have these people in my 

2478
01:46:07,711 --> 01:46:07,711
house.
And so,

2479
01:46:07,711 --> 01:46:07,711
um,
I want to get a studio.

2480
01:46:07,711 --> 01:46:07,711
What's Tom going to do?
He's,

2481
01:46:07,711 --> 01:46:09,410
I mean I don't want to tell everyone 
Tom's business,

2482
01:46:09,411 --> 01:46:13,280
but I think he's probably pretty open,
but he's gonna like he's going out,

2483
01:46:13,281 --> 01:46:18,281
he's big.
He's going to do what you're doing on 

2484
01:46:18,281 --> 01:46:18,281
this post.
Smaller level.

2485
01:46:18,281 --> 01:46:21,460
He wants to start shooting stuff and 
making like his own branded content 

2486
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:23,750
that's just thompson.
His sense of humor him and push do their

2487
01:46:23,751 --> 01:46:25,950
podcasts out of there to her podcast out
of there.

2488
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:31,130
Make shows you should do is we should 
get another space and build it up just 

2489
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:35,981
like this space and have one that's got 
like four studios in it and a bunch of 

2490
01:46:35,981 --> 01:46:38,060
us can use them and you just pay a 
certain amount of rent per month.

2491
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:39,470
A man.
That's where I'm at.

2492
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,590
I look at Jamie and I talked for a 
little bit before you got here,

2493
01:46:42,591 --> 01:46:44,680
but like you know,
men's health code this.

2494
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:47,720
But I shot the whole fucking thing.
Like I shot all of it.

2495
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:51,180
I shot the spartan and edited it and 
it's fun for me.

2496
01:46:51,181 --> 01:46:54,150
Like I shot the whole thing.
I just went around and set up a camera,

2497
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:55,890
go do the event,
grab the camera,

2498
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:57,960
set up the camera,
do the thing,

2499
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,300
give them a camera to Mike Bertolina do 
the thing,

2500
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:05,390
and I did that with the marathon.
Covered the whole fucking thing on my 

2501
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:08,991
phone.
So it's like if I could get myself a 

2502
01:47:08,991 --> 01:47:08,991
junior fucking editor,
Bro,

2503
01:47:08,991 --> 01:47:11,370
I'll put out content every day 
throughout the bat signal.

2504
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:14,220
Put it on your instagram to say,
you know,

2505
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:15,540
you're the girl.
Just threw it out.

2506
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:16,740
Don't do that.
I just did though.

2507
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:17,730
Yeah,
he definitely just did.

2508
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:20,160
But you really want to make sure they're
not crazy.

2509
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:24,030
That's the hard part because you get 
some dude integrated into your life.

2510
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:28,650
They turned out to be insane because 
didn't David spade his guy?

2511
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:33,680
He had an assistant,
his assistant tasered him and in the 

2512
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,250
middle of the fucking system.
Who did that?

2513
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,830
Someone else did Davis girl through 
their assistant.

2514
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:43,890
So kind of got broke into David's house 
and tasered him in the middle of the 

2515
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:45,030
fucking night.
How bad must he be to work for?

2516
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,080
I'm not saying that it was justified.
I'm not saying that.

2517
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:58,650
Oh,
but come on man,

2518
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,750
something.
Something had to be fucked up.

2519
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:06,070
Bag that when they were doing the break.
I do.

2520
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,720
I love them as bait.
I'm not shitting on him,

2521
01:48:07,721 --> 01:48:09,310
but you know,
when they were doing the breakdown,

2522
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:11,890
the police officers were talking to 
David spade there like he did nothing.

2523
01:48:11,891 --> 01:48:16,891
Huh?
Like how many does he pick up your 

2524
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:16,891
laundry?
How long have you been working for you?

2525
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:18,370
How many?
How many coffees you drink a day.

2526
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:20,890
Hello?
What was it that you said?

2527
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:21,430
Oh,
I love that.

2528
01:48:21,431 --> 01:48:26,431
That's your takeaway,
dude.

2529
01:48:27,231 --> 01:48:29,540
I gotta wrap this up unfortunately 
because I got drawn here.

2530
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:32,610
I found that cartoon.
Let's wrap it up with this list.

2531
01:48:32,990 --> 01:48:36,020
Bert Kreischer.
Secret time this Friday.

2532
01:48:36,021 --> 01:48:38,430
Is it Thursday night at midnight?
Thursday night at midnight.

2533
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,340
Last night.
Viewing party.

2534
01:48:40,341 --> 01:48:41,600
That's tonight.
You fucks.

2535
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:44,270
So tonight at midnight.
It airs.

2536
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:48,140
Secret time on Netflix or blow the fuck 
up.

2537
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:50,480
I'm in Irvine this weekend or next 
weekend,

2538
01:48:50,481 --> 01:48:51,350
but yeah,
check out.

2539
01:48:51,351 --> 01:48:52,430
Secret time.
Thank you joe.

2540
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,950
I love you brother.
Thank you man.

2541
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:54,920
Here we go.

2542
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:57,140
Tom.

2543
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:00,800
This is so funny.

2544
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:33,160
We're about to pass out.
That's actually probably better than a.

2545
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:35,730
they're going to come up with how much 
money does he have?

2546
01:49:35,731 --> 01:49:39,590
These maintenance,
his own trailer bitches.

2547
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:42,540
Thanks brother.
Oh,

2548
01:49:42,550 --> 01:49:43,780
that was awesome.
That was really.
