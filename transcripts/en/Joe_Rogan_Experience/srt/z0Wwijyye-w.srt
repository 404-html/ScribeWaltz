00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,060
Hello Freak bitches.
If you're a dude and your best friend is

2
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:08,490
a woman,
it's,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,571
it's,
it's,

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:10,404
uh,
it's,

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,560
it's suspect,
suspect highly suspect.

6
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:14,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,040
Unless she's really unusual.
Well,

8
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:17,874
look,
there are,

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,520
there are,
and I'm not saying that women and hot

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,270
women and whoever are,
I mean they're fucking good.

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,300
They can be great friends,
but you all,

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,990
if they're hot and even if they're not,
you sometimes still wanna yeah.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,630
Fuck that.
And that's okay.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,280
Right.
You know the guys that do have like a,

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,200
a hot woman,
that's a best friend that they're not

16
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:44,250
banging and they pretend no,
it's just totally platonic.

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,480
Okay.
I could never trust that guy unless he

18
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,190
has like an insanely hot wife that,
that or,

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,810
or if they used to date,
yes.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,760
That's awesome.
That's possible.

21
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:59,880
If they legitimately have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

22
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:02,970
Right?
Like I have exes that like I wouldn't

23
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:04,560
want to sleep with,
but in their hot,

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,210
you know what I mean?

25
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,630
Right.
It's over,

26
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,410
it's over.
But you're still friends friendly and

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,900
did not your best shit.
Fucking weird.

28
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,000
That's weird.
What's weird when anybody,

29
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,210
like when a guy is like working in angle
and trying really hard to like position

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,700
himself as better than he positioned
himself as being like different than

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,010
every other guy.
You know,

32
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,260
there's a lot of guys out there doing
really negative things.

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,540
I read this one guy's fucking twitter
page other day.

34
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,590
It was amazing.
It was just like he's.

35
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:38,400
He might be the ultimate White Knight.
I don't want to give out his twitter

36
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,680
page,
but he.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,180
He might be like the greatest.
If I met him,

38
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:46,620
he probably has almost no blood in his
veins is blood sugar is probably zero.

39
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,770
He probably faints all day long.
It was so weak.

40
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,750
But one of the things he said is he
said,

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,060
he said,
although I still practice feminists,

42
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,890
still practice feminism.
I no longer associate.

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,920
I no longer would you say advertise
myself as a feminist because I feel like

44
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,750
it's up to women to decide whether or
not I'm doing feminism correctly.

45
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,180
Oh Jesus Christ.
So I'll still practice feminism,

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,720
but I will no longer advertise myself as
a feminist.

47
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,190
Jesus Christ.
That's A.

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,130
I actually don't even know what to say
about that.

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,490
And then I got,
I started playing in a rock band and my

50
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,590
20th century I didn't do much martial
arts at all.

51
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,140
After you,
did you practice music before that?

52
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,980
Like when did you get involved in music?
Was a growing up as a kid,

53
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,070
Bruce Lee and Alice Cooper are like my
two Glam rock came from the makeup and,

54
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,790
and a late mid twenties I started
playing in a band and I really liked

55
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,450
performing and I did a lot of jumping
and kicking and wearing tight pants and

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,740
you know,
and David Lee Roth.

57
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,210
Exactly,
exactly.

58
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,970
And uh,
somewhere,

59
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:06,610
but you and David Lee Roth in the New
York dolls know very drunk,

60
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,860
very,
very fucked up like through the whole

61
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,000
era.
Like we would go and we.

62
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,750
Oh Man.
And I told Eddie this story.

63
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,040
I haven't told a lot of people this
story,

64
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,380
but people ask me about it.
My friends ask me about it recently,

65
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,700
but I was basically on tour.

66
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,350
So I do that for like 10,
12,

67
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:23,440
14 years and we're touring England in
the UK.

68
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,300
And um,
and uh,

69
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,700
like uh,
Italy and a few places like that we did

70
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,720
really well over there and I had a
seizure from just doing so much drugs

71
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:36,721
and drinking so much and like a bad,
like you basically I had been,

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,600
when I came back the doctor said the
vodka and red bull was actually the

73
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,930
biggest component.
The fact that I took a lot of speed over

74
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,660
the three days without sleeping,
let me drink more vodka,

75
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:50,050
red bull.
But basically as the sugar leaves your

76
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:52,810
body,
it goes down and you and you get sick

77
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,520
and when the alcohol then leaves your
body,

78
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,340
it draws more sugar and you have a
hypoglycemic seizure.

79
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,270
So I've lived laying on the couch,
I felt terrible for like 10 hours and

80
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,300
then all of a sudden apparently I just
yelled something and people came over

81
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:09,040
and I felt this electricity shooting
down my arms into my hands and they just

82
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,510
locked up and I rolled back down.

83
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,270
My eyes rolled in my head.
I thought it was 10 seconds later and

84
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,160
everyone's looking at me like I just got
knocked out,

85
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,350
you know?
And then apparently it was like a minute

86
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:19,030
or something and I went back and the
doctor said,

87
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:20,320
dude,
you got to get your life together.

88
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,040
And I started training martial arts
again pretty much that day.

89
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,280
And then I trained,
you know,

90
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,550
three times a week,
then five,

91
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:30,160
then seven,
then I was doing Jujitsu Monday,

92
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,160
Wednesday,
Friday 7:00 AM noon and 6:00 PM and

93
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:35,740
Tuesday and Thursday noon and 6:00 PM.
And wait a minute,

94
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,510
you were training Jujitsu three times a
day.

95
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,740
Three times a day.
Monday,

96
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,011
Wednesday,
Friday.

97
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,000
Twice a day.
Tuesday,

98
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:43,690
Thursday for about six months.
And then people kind of knew me a little

99
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,120
in Canada,
like on television doing stuff.

100
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,990
I was like a reality show judge.
And the network said,

101
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,740
Oh,
you're going to fight.

102
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,240
Well why don't we do a TV show about
that?

103
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,910
Wow.
And that kind of allowed me.

104
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,100
I really want it to be in the fight
world.

105
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:59,050
That's what I love the second I kinda
had,

106
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,160
you know,
been not living a crazy lifestyle.

107
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,760
All I wanted to do his martial arts.
And then real really from that minute

108
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:07,990
on,
that's all I kind of did.

109
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,510
And that's all I was interested in.
How did you get started rapping you do

110
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,870
you,
do you consider that rap kind of started

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,570
off in spoken word.
So I started off,

112
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:20,530
just kind of spirals into hip hop.
And again,

113
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:24,880
a lot of people who've spoken word and
shit basically in poetry,

114
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,250
but it was exactly the same.
Um,

115
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,840
spoken word has potential.
We would have people like being.

116
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,030
People love.
I have a dream.

117
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,690
I have a dream is God damn spoken word.
I mean Martin Luther King's I have a

118
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:42,340
dream speech was referred to as spoken
word poetry because that's the most

119
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,460
literal tsunami.
A really an intricate stemmed upset.

120
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,810
That's one piece.
That's a whole story.

121
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:53,470
That's a spoken word.
Does this word poetry is poet.

122
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,530
Does that have a bad connotation?
Like a pretentious kind of think?

123
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,310
You're

124
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,500
right.
You say,

125
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,850
I remember I was at the comedy cellar in
New York and David tells on stage and

126
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:08,000
he's killing and there's this snotty
fucking the audience.

127
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,300
And for some reason the guy took offense
to want to Dave's jokes and says

128
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,510
something.
And,

129
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,880
and Dave's like,
well,

130
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,170
I'm sorry sir.
I'm just trying to.

131
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,450
You're trying to do some jokes.
What do you do for a living,

132
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,790
sir?
Now he's fucking.

133
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,570
The guy goes,
I'm a poet,

134
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,980
published and I'll never forget that
there for a year.

135
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:26,810
I would say that to people.
I'm a poet,

136
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,820
published,
like trying to get insurance and shit

137
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,220
like that.
I'd just try and explain what I do and

138
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:38,900
then just go with unemployed or self
employed because they put poetry on my

139
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,873
thing.
This,

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,260
I'll never forget that asshole.
I'm a poet,

141
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,530
published and he had like fashionable
clothes on shit,

142
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,310
you know,
just totally lives at home still with

143
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:53,030
his mom.
Dave attell doesn't even remember it,

144
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:56,060
but I remember it.
It wasn't even me that got heckled.

145
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,830
Fuckheads.
