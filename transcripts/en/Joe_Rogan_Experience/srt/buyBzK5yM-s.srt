1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,700
We gotta figure out a way to make it so 
we just have a white hole,

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,740
one button thing where everything syncs 
up with one button to so possible one 

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,210
day maybe.
We live right now with live,

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,050
live,
live.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,330
How are you sir?
Yeah,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,240
not too bad.
Welcome.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,590
Thanks for coming man.
Appreciate it.

8
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:17,310
Yeah,
no worries.

9
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:19,230
Thanks so much for having me.
Sam Harris is going to be with us,

10
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,450
but he flaked out last minute.
He's busy,

11
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,010
man.
Yeah,

12
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,420
he's a busy man.
I'm so.

13
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,260
I'm,
I'm,

14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,240
I'm interested to talk to you about a 
bunch of things,

15
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:32,241
but one of the big ones is this idea of 
effective altruism and this is something

16
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:33,780
that you really promote to the point 
where,

17
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,340
I don't know if this is true,
but I read this about you,

18
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:38,850
that everything that you make over 
$36,000

19
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:39,960
a year,
you donate.

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,740
Yeah,
that's right.

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,210
So wow.
Yeah.

22
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:46,380
So everything above,
technically it's anything above 20,000

23
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,640
pounds from 2009 Oxford,
so just inflation,

24
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,540
cost of living changes and stuff,
but that's about $36,000.

25
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,210
So you've just sort of decided that,
which is by the way,

26
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,060
the one percent for the whole world?
Yeah.

27
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,730
Not quite two percent.
Yeah.

28
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,660
I'll be in the top,
still be in the top two percent.

29
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:05,500
Even despite that,
it was 34,000.

30
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,920
I think $34,000
puts you in a top one percent.

31
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:12,921
I think it's $55,000.
That was a change and maybe since 

32
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:14,760
trump's been in office,
but it's a,

33
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,900
it's,
you know,

34
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,130
what you're doing is,
uh,

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,960
if that's the case,
that's a,

36
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,790
that's a very charitable thing.
Yeah.

37
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:25,791
And it's also,
I mean it's most of my income over the 

38
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:25,800
course of my life,
like especially as an academic,

39
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:27,990
you know,
going to an tons though,

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,100
since the effect of altruism blew up,
you end up getting things like speaking 

41
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,040
fees and give all that away as well.

42
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,460
It's going to end up probably being the 
large majority of income,

43
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:39,360
of course,
of my life.

44
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,460
Do you ever like want to buy something 
and be like,

45
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:46,461
shit,
if I wasn't so goddamn generous I'd be 

46
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:46,461
able to get this.
You know,

47
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:47,490
I never do.
I like basically never think that,

48
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,100
yeah,
I think like this,

49
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:55,101
like I feel like in contemporary society
we just get bombarded with marketing 

50
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,670
stuff all the time saying like,
oh,

51
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:59,400
you really need this thing if you're 
going to have a good life.

52
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,820
And I think like an almost every case,
that's just not true.

53
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,940
I think the psychological evidence just 
shows that once you go above a certain 

54
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,160
level of income,
um,

55
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,180
additional money just has a very small 
impact on your happiness.

56
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,540
And in my own case,
like the things that make me happy.

57
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,720
I like being surrounded by friends.
That's the gym membership,

58
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,760
that's like $40 a month or something.

59
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,110
It's not very much I can afford that.
Being able to work and you know,

60
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,850
why I really am passionate about and I 
already have that.

61
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,090
So my life is just so good in so many 
ways and I feel like there's so much of 

62
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,830
a focus on money and how money is the 
key to happiness and it's just,

63
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:38,640
I think it's just all bullshit basically
what's definitely some bullshit in it.

64
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:43,641
And I,
I see that a lot in my neighborhood 

65
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,590
because I live where white people go to 
breed and they,

66
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:47,220
they,
they go to breed and they,

67
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,250
they sit down and they just talk about 
things.

68
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,310
They talk about Range Rovers and certain
watches and certain purses and shoes and

69
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,920
yeah.
And it becomes this constant.

70
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,400
The amazing thing is just how you adapt.
So it's called the hedonic treadmill.

71
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,320
The richer you are,
the richer you need to be.

72
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,560
Oh yeah.
So I was once part of a conversation,

73
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,590
um,
I was going to give a talk and um,

74
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,300
I was going to like a family and was on 
the kind of the private jet in fact.

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,720
And the conversation was discussion of 
different private jets in which private 

76
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,411
jets are better than so.
And this other person has this really 

77
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:28,060
nice private jet and it just means that 
like at no stage do you ever lose the 

78
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,060
like,
oh,

79
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,920
I could just have this nicer thing.
No,

80
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,830
because you can get to the point where 
you want a jumbo jet,

81
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,550
like one of those Quantas air buses and 
house.

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,200
Yeah.
I mean,

83
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:43,201
I'm sure that one of those Richard 
Branson type character characters 

84
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:43,201
probably has something like that.
Yeah,

85
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:45,820
that's totally.
It seems to get to this.

86
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,270
You hit this critical mass stage where 
you,

87
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:53,271
you know,
like these billionaire characters where 

88
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:53,271
they start buying $100,000,000
yachts,

89
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:57,810
$400,000,000
yachts and what is the most expensive 

90
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,070
Yada believe it's a half a billion 
dollars or more incredible.

91
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,400
Yeah.
You need to have a staff to take care of

92
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,900
it the whole time.
And if it ever.

93
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,020
The thing is,
I think if I had a car that would make 

94
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,020
my life worse because not only to be 
stressing about this,

95
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,820
like what if it gets damaged?
Like I feel bad that I'm not using it.

96
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

97
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:16,540
I would imagine.
And less.

98
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,540
Well I guess not though,
because if you look at this,

99
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,810
oh Jesus Christ,
it's a billion billion dollars in a 

100
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,750
year.
The streets of Monaco is what it's 

101
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:28,750
called and it is $1,000,000,000.
Go to that thing.

102
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,440
Oh,
that's it.

103
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
Oh my God.
It's a,

104
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,460
it's a neighborhood.
I think some floating neighborhood.

105
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,440
I think on all of these things,
you should have the place,

106
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,470
the cost with how many bed nets you 
could buy for children in sub Saharan 

107
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,050
Africa.
Oh,

108
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,730
well that's just ridiculous.
Hold on.

109
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:48,370
Go up one once a one point 2 billion.

110
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,160
Scroll up.
Estimated price.

111
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,810
Oh my God.
The eclipse.

112
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,850
Oh,
forefront.

113
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,570
50 million to one point.
$2 billion.

114
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,880
That's like when you go to get it made 
and you go like,

115
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,450
how much is it going to cost me?
And like,

116
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,520
between four $50 million and one point 
$2 billion.

117
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,060
You're like,
oh,

118
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,100
you know,
normal,

119
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
normal shit.
Fucking change.

120
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,980
That is fucking insane.
Look at that God damn thing.

121
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,930
I mean that.
It's the.

122
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,730
Oh it's a replica of the Monaco Grand 
Prix track.

123
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,070
Oh my God.
That's insane.

124
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,070
So you can drive around on your yacht at
a ridiculous rate of speed.

125
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,310
So this guy probably has like a Ferrari.
They go all over the surface of his 

126
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,390
crazy yacht.
Okay,

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,690
let's get a fake beach.
But it hasn't been sold yet.

128
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,550
Oh,
it doesn't actually owned yet,

129
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:41,660
I don't think.
Oh,

130
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,310
okay.
Interesting.

131
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:47,311
Who buys that?
They're going to get love attention 

132
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:47,311
where there are enough people.

133
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:49,630
There's a bunch of those people.
I mean,

134
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,290
I don't want anyone to billion.
That's probably.

135
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,240
There's only a couple of thousand people
in the world who are worth that much.

136
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,020
Really?
Yeah.

137
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,890
If somebody's willing to sink the whole 
fortunate.

138
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,960
How many billionaires do you think there
are worldwide?

139
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,560
Let's guess he and a half thousand 
dollars million.

140
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,830
There's three and a half thousand 
dollars.

141
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,460
You're.
You sound very confident.

142
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,360
I think it's about that.
Yeah.

143
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,170
Oh,
that's,

144
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,540
that's a large number.
That is kind of crazy.

145
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,510
Three and a half thousand people that 
have more than $100.

146
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:16,511
Million dollars and here's a whole will 
macaskill at over 35,000.

147
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,800
Cuts it off,
but then half of that 1800,

148
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,460
1800 people.
Oh,

149
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,390
you're happy.
Glad we've got.

150
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,730
Well,
no,

151
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:27,140
I'm just happy we've got fact.
Check it on.

152
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,820
Connected health statistics.
That's a lot of money,

153
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:36,821
man,
but it is one of those weird things 

154
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:36,821
where I do not think that money equates 
to happen.

155
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:39,800
One of the things that money does do is 
it alleviates the stress of bills,

156
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,100
but a lot of those stress of bills can 
be alleviated by not buying as many 

157
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,100
things.
Right.

158
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,870
So like a lot of the stress of bills 
that people have is sort of self imposed

159
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,700
stress.
Like you get a mortgage for a very large

160
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,500
house,
you have car payments,

161
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,270
you have all these different things that
you're paying for.

162
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,540
So that kind of money stress that some 
people put themselves under is actually 

163
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,830
not really necessary.
Right.

164
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,160
So if you broke it down to what do you 
actually need,

165
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,550
just need a nice place to live where 
it's not crime Britain and it's safe.

166
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,890
You need a bed.
What else do you need?

167
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,720
Food.
You need food.

168
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,220
Exercise.
You one of those.

169
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,910
No TV dudes.
Do you have a tail?

170
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,640
Well,
I watched Netflix.

171
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,520
I just finished veep,
which I love.

172
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,990
Is it good?
Yeah,

173
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,820
it gets better.
The first season's on so good,

174
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:24,950
but they don't have that kind of 
patience.

175
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,990
Seasons.
Oh yeah.

176
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:31,991
I just got addicted.
Even if I want something and I think 

177
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:31,991
it's awful,
I still just.

178
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:32,690
I will get addicted right away.
I have to watch olefins.

179
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,060
Yeah.
I've liked the most compulsive 

180
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,060
personality.
Have you seen house of cards?

181
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,380
I have not seen a deliberately.
Not Stock Show.

182
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,150
Yeah.
That's a good show.

183
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,510
Like game of thrones makes my life 
worse.

184
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,510
I like hate it really.
I think it's amazing television,

185
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:51,200
but I find it to so distressing because 
you still have to watch it all the time.

186
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,660
Why do you find it distressing?
Just like the violence,

187
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,940
the violence,
people's gang.

188
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,780
The heads popped and stung.
Oh,

189
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:57,860
that one with the mountain?
Yeah.

190
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:59,200
That's the one that really stays with 
me.

191
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,220
That's rough.
Yeah.

192
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,430
I'm,
I'm.

193
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,770
It gives me a lot of anxiety because I 
know there's only two seasons left and 

194
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,441
the next season is one coming up.
It's only seven episodes and the final 

195
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,080
season is only six.
I'm so happy about that.

196
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:14,060
It's like it's not making me happy.
Well,

197
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,210
I'm not very happy about that at all.
It's like someone saying they're going 

198
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:19,210
to stop selling heroin or something.
I'm like,

199
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,150
yeah,
I'm going to have to get hooked on 

200
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,081
Oxycontin and that's what I feel I'm 
going to have to watch the whole season 

201
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:27,790
all over again or the whole series.
Um,

202
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,380
so you have a television,
you have a computer.

203
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm sure you have the computer.
Yeah.

204
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,860
Um,
yeah,

205
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,410
I like moving around two tons,
so I normally,

206
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,440
like I don't have a house,
but it wouldn't be convenient type of 

207
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,440
house because I'm traveling so much to 
you.

208
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,650
Brenda apartment or something and had an
apartment.

209
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,200
You live in England?
I live in oaks most of the time.

210
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,390
I spent quite a chunk of my time out in 
the bay area.

211
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,870
I'm like significant part of our staff 
and the nonprofits out there.

212
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,200
I've got lots of contacts still the 
organizations about that.

213
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:59,201
So most of your time you,
it seems like you're spending working 

214
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:01,410
for charitable organizations or.
Yeah,

215
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,290
so I have kind of three hats.
So one is an academic,

216
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,300
so I'm the festival oxides.
Second is this kind of more public 

217
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,651
figure whether I'm talking about these 
ideas through books or on this podcast 

218
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:16,911
and so on.
And then third is I run a nonprofit 

219
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:16,911
called the center for effective 
altruism,

220
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:19,050
which is more about like finding the 
best charities,

221
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:24,051
the ones that doing the most good is 
going to help other people the most and 

222
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:28,221
kind of promote them and try and get 
people to give more and to give more 

223
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:28,221
effectively.

224
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:29,730
Yeah.
We've gone over ineffective charities or

225
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,460
I shouldn't say ineffective,
but charities that are the way they're 

226
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,901
structured,
when you look at how much money is 

227
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:39,960
actually going towards the charity 
itself and how much is going towards the

228
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,930
structure of the organization,
it's kind of crazy.

229
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Yeah,
I mean I think so that's normally the 

230
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,140
focus of ineffective cavities is on 
like,

231
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,500
yeah,
how much is spent on overheads.

232
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,960
But I actually think that's not the most
important thing.

233
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,290
The most important thing is what's the 
charity actually doing?

234
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,710
Like what's the actual program?
So one chata tea for the example that 

235
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,491
I'm sure you'll find funny as a chatbot,
skilled homeopaths without borders and 

236
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:09,260
it goes to Haiti and particularly on 
disobedience like homeopathic 

237
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,260
calamities,
um,

238
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,450
you know,
which don't work,

239
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:14,451
they don't provide any health benefit.
And even if at a zero percent overhead 

240
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:15,870
cost,
so apps like spent nothing,

241
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:16,950
everything was volunteers.

242
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,100
It would still be bad child teach.
Those shouldn't be given to that Chata 

243
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,880
tea.
This one I didn't know that that one 

244
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:24,880
existed.
Yeah.

245
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Yeah.
It's kind of small,

246
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,331
but I would imagine phil,
thankfully homeopaths without Borders 

247
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,840
God.
But then there's some super effective 

248
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,991
charities like paradigm that's saving a 
life with flt three and a half thousand 

249
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:39,930
dollars,
like the against malaria foundation.

250
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,240
Even if they were spending a bunch on 
investigating what are the best areas to

251
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,310
focus on or like paying of that stuff 
more.

252
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,760
If what you should just care about is 
how much money you're putting in and 

253
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:52,760
what you're getting is an outcome.
Right?

254
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,950
Well,
I think it's impossible for everyone to.

255
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,400
It's impossible for you to give $10 and 
all $10 is going to go directly to the 

256
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,910
charity because there's got to be 
overhead,

257
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:07,911
there's got to be infrastructure,
there's got to be a bunch of people 

258
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:08,340
working there,
rent costs.

259
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,490
But the question is,
at what point does it become kind of a 

260
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,841
scam?
Because there are most certainly some 

261
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:21,021
organizations that appear to be 
charitable organizations but are really 

262
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,340
kind of a scam.
Yeah,

263
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,900
there's definitely some.
So like the kid's wish network,

264
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,540
for example,
kind of like the make a wish foundation,

265
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:32,541
similar idea.
And they spent 99 percent of their 

266
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,391
budget on fundraising.
So they were just like this kind of 

267
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:39,100
chatter Ponzi scheme basically.
So they spend all their money on 

268
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,760
fundraising itself.
Yeah.

269
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,900
To then invest in more fundraising and 
one percent somehow or another gets out 

270
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:44,900
there.
Yeah.

271
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,910
What does that.
Maybe it's not as high as 99 percent is 

272
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,130
above 90 percent or something crazy.
So what does that money get to?

273
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,990
Like what do they do with the actual 
money itself?

274
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,740
And then the idea that was

275
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,980
granting wishes for sick children.
Um,

276
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,710
so,
uh,

277
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,810
do you remember the San Francisco thing 
with back kid?

278
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,060
It was like,
a bit like there was a big event,

279
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:08,410
lots of publicity around this kid,
a child that had some strange disorder.

280
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,190
Yeah.
So,

281
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,390
um,
the child,

282
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,090
I don't know the details.
I think the child had leukemia.

283
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,490
They have wished was that they wanted to
be Batman for the day.

284
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,690
[inaudible] this is a different thing.
Yeah.

285
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:17,170
Okay,
cool.

286
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,960
So they like the make a wish foundation 
set up.

287
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,710
This um,
you know,

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,870
amazing store.
They were,

289
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:26,350
they got to kind of drive and a 
batmobile and like have this a fantastic

290
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:31,351
day with it.
Basically Batman for the day kids which 

291
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:31,351
network is doing basically the same 
thing.

292
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:35,850
They find seriously sick kids often 
terminally ill kids and say what one 

293
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,490
thing would you want?
And we'll make it happen.

294
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,270
But at the,
I think the but there is a lot of focus 

295
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,450
on like particularly bad charities,
you know,

296
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,940
the ones that really come up too is 
completely dysfunctional.

297
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,460
But I think that's not actually the most
important message.

298
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,750
What's most important is just even among
the charities that kind of good,

299
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,580
even the ones that are making a 
difference,

300
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,850
there's still a vast difference in the 
impact that you have difference of 

301
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,821
hundreds of thousands of times between 
the penalties that are merely good and 

302
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:06,860
there's ones that are really the very 
best and that's by mainly dependent on 

303
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,560
what program are they focusing on.
So what is there any charity that people

304
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:15,901
should avoid spending their money on?
Like are there other charities that you 

305
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,340
feel like are just so ridiculously 
ineffective?

306
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,720
Like,
yeah,

307
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:24,721
I mean like the ones we mentioned of 
kids who wished network or homeopaths 

308
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,200
without borders.
I'm the borders.

309
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,850
This is ridiculous.
It's like food.

310
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,840
Who on parade?
Just stop.

311
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,670
Yeah,
I mean there was another one.

312
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,870
I can't remember that but it does.

313
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,340
I'm a strategy without limits and with 
that limit.

314
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,880
No,
it does.

315
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,970
I'm dolphin therapy for autistic 
children which has no evidence of 

316
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,580
working,
um,

317
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,720
but does actually just have some,
like the risk of the children's 

318
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,230
learning.
So yeah,

319
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,130
so you can like chatty pick these 
examples.

320
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:56,131
But the thing is that these aren't just 
like not really representative in 

321
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:56,131
general.
I think charities doing good.

322
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,550
Um,
but the question is just like in the 

323
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:01,550
same way as if you're buying a product 
for yourself,

324
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,270
you don't just want to get like,
you know,

325
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,700
a laptop as long as it's work.
So you want to find like what's the best

326
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:11,701
laptop I can get with my money?
Or if you're investing you want to not 

327
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:11,860
just get like an okay to turn.
You want to say,

328
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,450
well what's the best to the attorney can
get.

329
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,310
Right.
So in that sense,

330
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,260
I think like the number of charities 
that you think is just,

331
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,290
yeah,
this is literally competing for being 

332
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:22,290
the most effective charity in the world.

333
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,120
That's actually fairly small.
So givewell for the examples a evaluates

334
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:30,121
it looks all sorts of different global 
health and global development charities 

335
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,350
and it's less of charities that's like,
yeah,

336
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:37,351
this is super good.
You should literally be donating to 

337
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:39,511
them.
It's only seven charities long at the 

338
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,551
moment.
Mine is up from last year when it was 

339
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:41,551
only for travel to wow.
Seven charities.

340
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:42,370
That of how,
I mean,

341
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,340
what is the overall total of act of 
charities?

342
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,500
It's got to be in the thousands,
hundreds of thousands,

343
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,200
I'm sure.
What got you involved in this?

344
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:55,201
So you're a young,
you seem like you should be playing 

345
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:55,880
video games and skateboarding or 
something.

346
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:58,040
I spent a lot of my teenage years 
playing video games.

347
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,450
Yeah,
it was,

348
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,400
again,
compulsive personality.

349
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I need the band myself from doing it.
So you're compulsive personalities now 

350
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500
going towards good things.
Yeah,

351
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,890
I manage the key was managing my life so
that the things I get really focused on 

352
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:11,890
addicted.

353
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm addicted to good things than bad.
Um,

354
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,820
so yeah,
it all started back in.

355
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,090
So I was back in high school.
I'm kind of undergraduate of being very 

356
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,960
convinced by the arguments that this 
philosopher,

357
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,070
Peter Singer,
oh,

358
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:30,090
I know Peter Singer,
he's like a radical animal rights 

359
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,090
activist.
He has.

360
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,500
Yeah.
He has a few things.

361
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,290
Um,
and he had this argument,

362
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,420
which is that,
you know,

363
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,110
the way I tell the story is,
imagine I'm someone walks is walking 

364
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,581
past a shallow pond and they see a child
drowning in that shallow pond and they 

365
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:48,800
could run in and they could save the 
child.

366
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,730
Butler willing a really nice suit suit 
the costs like $3,000.

367
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,080
And so they say,
no,

368
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,750
I'm not going to save that child.
I'm just going to walk by and let it 

369
00:15:59,750 --> 00:15:59,750
down because I don't want to lose the 
cost of this suit.

370
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,360
I normally say,
look in moral philosophy,

371
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,300
we have a technical term for people like
that they called assholes.

372
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,830
And uh,
the,

373
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,920
this is how I convey it in my seminars.
Um,

374
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,800
and obviously we all agree like,
yeah,

375
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:16,790
come on,
if it's just,

376
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,190
you could clearly save this child,
it's light in front of you.

377
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,510
You ought to do that.
The cost of $30,000

378
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:26,511
does not count.
But then what Peter Singer's insight is 

379
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:26,511
it says,
well,

380
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,120
what's the difference between that 
child?

381
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:33,121
It's right there in front of you and 
that child that's in Subsaharan Africa 

382
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:34,070
who you could save,
you'll never meet them for sure.

383
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,010
Um,
but you could still save their life with

384
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:42,011
just a few thousand dollars if you 
donate it to a barely effective 

385
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:45,011
nonprofit and he considers all the 
different ways in which these cases 

386
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:46,640
might be just analogous but decides 
ultimately like,

387
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,760
no,
there's actually just know morally 

388
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:51,760
relevant difference.
And so yeah,

389
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,841
we do just have an obligation to give 
away at least a very significant 

390
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:55,841
proportion of our income.

391
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,360
And I was really convinced by this kind 
of on an intellectual level for many 

392
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,890
years,
but I never really did anything about 

393
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:05,890
it.
Uh,

394
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,720
and not until I went to Oxford to do a 
postgraduate degree in philosophy.

395
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,570
And in the summer between that I needed 
some money.

396
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:16,571
I worked as a fundraiser for care 
international global development 

397
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:17,360
charity.
So I was one of those annoying people in

398
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:18,960
the street who had kind of passed the 
light,

399
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,010
can get in your way and then ask you to 
donate $10 a month.

400
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,380
And it meant the all day.
Every day.

401
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:25,550
I was talking about like,
look,

402
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:27,650
this is the conditions of people in 
extreme poverty,

403
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,860
we can do so much to help people at such
little cost to ourselves,

404
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,510
you know,
why are we not doing this?

405
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,050
And I was just over and over again kind 
of getting these apathetic responses and

406
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,310
I was just getting so frustrated because
I just thought,

407
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:42,030
look,
these people just not living up to their

408
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:42,830
own values.

409
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,130
People killingly do Claire Care,
but there's some sort of block going on.

410
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,780
And then I thought,
well,

411
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,930
I'm going to do philosophy.
At the time I was planning to do like 

412
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:52,930
philosophy of language,
logic,

413
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,450
very esoteric stuff.
And so I thought,

414
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,370
well,
I'm not living up to my own values.

415
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,710
Um,
I should really try and make a change.

416
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,520
And so I went to Oxford and I started 
asking a whole bunch of different kind 

417
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,780
of academics or what,
what's the impact of your work?

418
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,600
What kind of difference have you made?
And normally they were like,

419
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,920
I'm not really in it to make an impact.
I just got interested in these ideas and

420
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:18,921
that was pretty disheartening.
But I kept persisting until I met 

421
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:19,890
another postgraduate student called Toby
Ord,

422
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,240
and he just blew me away because he had 
also been convinced by these ideas,

423
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,400
but he'd gone one step further and he'd 
said,

424
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:31,401
Yep,
I've made a commitment to give away 

425
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:31,401
almost all of my income of the course of
my life,

426
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:31,500
about million pounds.

427
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,870
At the time,
he was living on 9,000

428
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:38,871
pounds,
saving 2000 pounds and donating 2000 

429
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:38,871
pounds.
So he was like,

430
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:42,730
well,
really hardcore the thing as well as 

431
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,640
actually taking these ideas and putting 
into practice what really blew me away 

432
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:45,640
was just how positive he was.
And he was.

433
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:50,690
It was not the.
He was kind of wearing his hair shirt 

434
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,480
flagellating instead he was saying,
look,

435
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:55,290
this is an amazing way to live.
We have this amazing opportunity to do a

436
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,990
huge amount of goods to help so many 
other people,

437
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:02,991
thousands of people.
It's actually a very low cost to 

438
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:06,021
ourselves.
And me having that one person who also 

439
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:09,990
kind of shared my worldview,
shared my ambitions,

440
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,760
just meant kind of gave that little 
psychological block was lifted.

441
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,500
And it meant that I was like,
okay,

442
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,450
cool,
I'm on board first,

443
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:19,680
I can a committed 10 percent.

444
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,430
Then I was like,
no,

445
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,170
actually I think I can do this for the 
pledge.

446
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,630
Um,
and then that meant I had this question 

447
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:27,630
of,
well,

448
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,200
I'm planning to give awake,
come like million pounds over the course

449
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,660
of my life.
Where should that money go?

450
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,730
You know,
I want to make sure it has as big an 

451
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:35,730
impact as possible.
And that meant I started digging into,

452
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,850
well how can we compare the between 
different charities?

453
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:40,560
I found there was a ton of work for 
them,

454
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,620
health and development economics that 
could help us to answer this.

455
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,250
And what began as this kind of side 
project between these two,

456
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,750
you know,
ivory tower,

457
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,220
academics,
me and toby,

458
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,640
we found that loads of people,
just Lee,

459
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,840
I'm taken by this idea both of giving 
more but in particular have given more 

460
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,030
effectively.
And over time,

461
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:05,031
this kind of global movement called 
effective altruism start to form around 

462
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:07,080
these ideas and sort to pollutant and a 
couple of ways.

463
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,710
So one is the pollutant away from just 
charitable donations to also thinking 

464
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,680
about,
well,

465
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,530
what should I think about with respect 
to make personal consumption?

466
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,800
What should I think about with respect 
to my career if I'm really aiming to do 

467
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:21,800
as much good as possible,
what should I do?

468
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,920
And then secondly also starting to think
about cause areas other than just global

469
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:30,921
poverty as well,
and it tends to be the case that within 

470
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:34,431
the community at the moment,
the cause areas that people think are 

471
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,900
the very most pressing our global health
and development still for sure.

472
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,000
But then also factory farming,
um,

473
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,590
where again,
there's just such a vast amount of 

474
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,590
suffering which is completely 
unnecessary.

475
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,780
And then also preservation the long,
long future of humanity and wedding 

476
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,080
about risks of,
you know,

477
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,090
global catastrophe,
things that may be fairly unlikely but 

478
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,090
would be very,
very bad.

479
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,790
Um,
if they did happen,

480
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,910
especially relating to new technology 
like um,

481
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,070
you know,
novel pathogens,

482
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,230
sort of violence as you could design in 
the lab and so on.

483
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:10,550
Well,
you're also very concerned with ai as 

484
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:10,550
well,
right?

485
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:10,550
Artificial

486
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:10,550
intelligence.
Yeah,

487
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:10,700
that's exactly right.
And that's,

488
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:14,420
I think in this category of,
if you look at the history of,

489
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,250
um,
human progress,

490
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,880
technological change just creates these 
huge step changes and just how humanity 

491
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,720
progresses.
So it was only 12 years,

492
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,400
um,
in 19 nine,

493
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:30,790
19,
33 to then 1945 between Leo Szilard 

494
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,100
first coming up with the idea of the 
nuclear chain reaction and that was just

495
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,410
purely conceptual idea in a bit of 
paper,

496
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,980
12 years from that to then the 
deployment of the first nuclear bomb and

497
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:47,021
think how radical a change that is 
having suddenly being in the nuclear 

498
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:47,570
age.
That was only 12 years.

499
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,070
Yeah.
We went over the,

500
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,130
the invention of the airplane to 
dropping an atomic bomb out of the 

501
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,550
airplane.
I believe it was 50 years,

502
00:21:55,551 --> 00:22:00,551
right?
Somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 

503
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:00,551
years.
Yeah.

504
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:00,551
Isn't that take a few?

505
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:04,180
Yeah.
So technological progress can suddenly 

506
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,551
go in these huge leaps that we're not 
prepared for the well often very not 

507
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:10,241
prepared for.
And I think artificial intelligence is 

508
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,590
in this context that you were,
were really making a radical progress in

509
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
ai,
especially over the last five years.

510
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,190
Um,
it's really one of the fastest 

511
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,190
developing technologies,
I think,

512
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,520
and yet has huge potential and so many 
different ways.

513
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,830
Um,
and as with any new technology,

514
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,740
huge positive potential relief,
you get ai light,

515
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:31,550
you can solve almost any problem,
but also potential risks as well.

516
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,970
Um,
where there's a risk that might be more 

517
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,000
familiar.
Um,

518
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,710
you know,
what he's about automation,

519
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,100
unemployment and what he's about,
autonomous weapons,

520
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,820
which I think should be taken seriously.
And then also just what he's about.

521
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:51,821
Well,
what if we could really do manage to 

522
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:51,821
make human level artificial 
intelligence?

523
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:54,620
It's very good arguments that would then
quickly move to super human level,

524
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:59,621
artificial intelligence.
And what then are we now in a situation 

525
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,840
like the neanderthals Homo Sapiens,
where we've suddenly created this 

526
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,570
intelligence that's greater than our 
own?

527
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,700
Are we able to control that?
Are we able to ensure that transition is

528
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,980
positive rather than negative?
Have you ever ever

529
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,980
considered the possibility when you look
at all the impoverished people in the 

530
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,170
world,
all the cruelty,

531
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:23,510
all the people that we are so concerned 
with,

532
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:28,511
material possessions and shallow 
thinking and war and just the evil that 

533
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:34,301
men do,
is it possible that we're sort of an 

534
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,490
outdated concept that what we are as 
these biological organisms that are 

535
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,811
still slaves to the whole Darwinian 
evolutionary survival of the fittest,

536
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,320
natural selection sort of paradigm that 
we've operated under for all these many 

537
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,970
thousands and hundreds of thousands of 
years as humans?

538
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,750
Is it possible that we're giving birth 
to the next thing that just like we 

539
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:04,391
don't long for the days when we used to 
be monkeys throwing shit at each other 

540
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:07,691
from the trees.
One day we will be something different.

541
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:13,211
Whether it will be a combination of us 
and these machines or whether we're 

542
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:17,450
going to augment our own intelligence 
with some sort of artificial.

543
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,410
Whether it's some sort of a an exo brain
or something that's going to take us to 

544
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,331
the or.
It's going to be simply that we create 

545
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:31,961
artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence no longer has 

546
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:34,961
used for us because we're a logical and 
then that becomes the new life form and 

547
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:38,720
then we're,
we're locked hide in the cave somewhere 

548
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:38,720
hoping the terminators don't get us.
Yeah,

549
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,140
I mean I think like over the longterm,
I mean with all of these things,

550
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:47,141
the question of kind of timelines is 
very hot and sometimes people want to 

551
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:50,090
project this discussion because Oh,
this is so far in the future.

552
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,540
Whereas I think like if something 
sufficiently report we should be talking

553
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,910
about it even if maybe it's,
you know,

554
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,230
decades and generations hence might be 
right.

555
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:02,300
I mean it might not be that far away,
but who knows,

556
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,590
Lakewood,
the atomic bomb.

557
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,440
That was hugely fast progress.
I'm just,

558
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,490
you know,
12 years.

559
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,920
So we want to be prepared.
Um,

560
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,600
but then has for like,
yeah,

561
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,510
is it going to be Homo sapiens around 
for the next,

562
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,460
you know,
in a thousand years' time.

563
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,410
I think that would just be extremely 
unlikely.

564
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,830
That will be around.
You think we're not going to be around 

565
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,830
anymore.
Yeah,

566
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,670
I mean I think if intelligent creatures 
are still around,

567
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:27,500
it's going to be some in a thousand 
years' time,

568
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,900
it's going to be something that's not 
homo sapiens.

569
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:32,460
Like he said this kind of fee.
Um,

570
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,840
oh.
It's like not what we would consider 

571
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:37,840
consider kind of typical humans now.
Well,

572
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,240
we're obviously severely flawed.
Right?

573
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:39,830
And I mean,
if we're,

574
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,330
like,
if you ask people,

575
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,360
if you ask the average person,
do you think that in your lifetime you 

576
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,260
can imagine a world without war?
Most people say no.

577
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,030
Like the vast majority of people say no 
war,

578
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,900
a world without crime,
a world without violence,

579
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,550
a world without theft.

580
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,580
Most people say no.
That's,

581
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,230
that just shows you how inherently 
flawed.

582
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Most people view the human species.
We know that we can do it in small 

583
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,240
groups.
You know,

584
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,830
like if the three of us were on an 
island,

585
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,590
I'm pretty sure we wouldn't be stealing 
from each other and murder each other,

586
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:09,900
right?
Yeah,

587
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,260
just a few of us.
But when you get to large scale,

588
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:17,261
humanity comes very easy to disassociate
or create this diffusion of 

589
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,600
responsibility where there's enough 
people.

590
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:23,900
So you don't really value them as much 
and you're allowed to get away with some

591
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:28,901
pretty heinous stuff,
especially when you consider drone 

592
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:31,451
warfare.
Things that we're able to do with long 

593
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,450
distance where we're not seeing the 
person that we're having the effect on.

594
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,590
Yeah,
absolutely.

595
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,500
It's a very flawed thing.
The human species.

596
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,150
Um,
wouldn't it be better if something 

597
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:42,150
better came along?
I mean,

598
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:42,650
I think this.
Yeah,

599
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:43,740
sorta.

600
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,590
Yeah.
I think that's the case though.

601
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,850
Well,
we'd be obsolete.

602
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,390
Yeah.
I mean,

603
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:48,820
well,
we're,

604
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,940
we're going to be obsolete in a hundred 
years anyway.

605
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:53,900
I mean I'm,
as in will be dead.

606
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,890
Right?
So the question is just,

607
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,930
um,
we'll all kind of,

608
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,360
you know,
generations hence will,

609
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:01,230
you know,
it's not.

610
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:03,530
The question is not really about us,
it's about our grandchildren live.

611
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,660
It really forces the idea to be 
considered like what is valuable about 

612
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,300
life?
Like is it the experience,

613
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,080
is it happiness?
Is it shared fun?

614
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,210
Is it love?
Like what is,

615
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:23,211
what's valuable about being a person and
how much of that is going to change if 

616
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,060
we're made out of something that people 
have created or,

617
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,390
or maybe were made out of something 
artificial intelligence has created 

618
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,390
because we've created something that's 
far superior to us.

619
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,650
So yeah,
I mean,

620
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:36,820
I have a view on this as you might 
expect.

621
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,580
I mean,
in my view,

622
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,150
the thing that's valuable and the only 
thing that's valuable ultimately as 

623
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,490
conscious experience,
so that's good.

624
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,900
Like red conscious experiences,
happy happiness,

625
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:49,770
joy,
and so on.

626
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:55,070
That's positive,
that's good for the world of negative 

627
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,070
conscious experiences,
suffering,

628
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,320
pain,
distress,

629
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,470
those are bad for the world.
And so that's why,

630
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:03,870
you know,
it's a good thing for me to do some 

631
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,990
service to you to benefit you,
but I can't do anything good to benefit 

632
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,430
this bottle of water.
Right?

633
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,650
And so then the key question in terms of
what should we think about,

634
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,780
supposing it is the case that,
you know,

635
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:16,230
thousand years time,
it's now a synthetic life.

636
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:20,100
It's artificial intelligence or 
something that's a,

637
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,630
um,
the,

638
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,660
like the in charge and are no longer any
humans.

639
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,240
Would this be good or bad?
The question for me is,

640
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,570
you know,
are they having conscious experiences 

641
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:32,570
and others conscious experiences,
good or bad?

642
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,980
So that's it.
Just conscious experience.

643
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,290
Yeah.
So it's a consumer so selfish.

644
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,410
It's a controversial view.
There's a thought experiment which is 

645
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,020
often used to challenge this view.
Um,

646
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,300
do you want to hear that?
Yes.

647
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,640
So it's called the experienced machine 
and the idea is supposing that tomato 

648
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:56,450
you could plug into this machine,
it's like the most amazing vr you could 

649
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,770
ever have.
And in this machine you will live,

650
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,420
let's say you live 200 years and you'll 
be in the most amazing bliss.

651
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,610
You'll have the most amazing experiences
of,

652
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:11,130
you know,
and your experiences will involve 

653
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,681
incredible relationships,
incredible creative achievement and so 

654
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:12,681
on.
Um,

655
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,720
and it'll just be like the perfect life 
that you could live expedientially for 

656
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,411
the next 200 years.
And the question is in so far as 

657
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,580
yourself interested,
so put aside considerations you might 

658
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:28,580
have about wanting to make the world a 
better place,

659
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,480
but just in so far as you care about 
yourself,

660
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,960
would you plug into this thing?
Bearing in mind that in a certain sense 

661
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:35,960
all of these experiences is going to be 
fake.

662
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,420
You're going to have experiences of 
having amazing friendships,

663
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,980
laying great works of art.
Can you think late works

664
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,310
of art and so on,
but they're.

665
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,880
They're not going to be available.
It's just sensory inputs provided by a 

666
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,320
computer.
Right.

667
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,500
So the question is,
would you or you in so far as your self 

668
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,420
interested and plug into this machine,
what would you,

669
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,840
what would you answer as a very good 
question?

670
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,790
I might already be plugged into it,
right?

671
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,870
I mean you.
Oh,

672
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:09,871
so this is,
this is a great question and I think 

673
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:12,871
it's a good argument against is the 
question will supposedly you will 

674
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:12,871
already plugged in.
Would you unplug?

675
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:17,790
Supposing I told you that actually 
you're a banker in Monaco and fuck 

676
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:17,980
Monaco,
I just,

677
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,350
I'm not interested in that.
No,

678
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,820
I want to stay right here.
Yeah.

679
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,260
So can I stay plugged in?
Please?

680
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,510
Do I have to pay more?
Would have to do.

681
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,210
You would have to do nothing,
but it's interesting man.

682
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:30,760
If people think so.
Most people,

683
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,720
and it seemed like maybe yourself would 
intuitively you'd say,

684
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,430
no,
I wouldn't plug into this machine.

685
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,210
I don't know if I would say that I would
have to really deeply consider it 

686
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,890
because right now it's just so.
It's so abstract.

687
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,740
This idea that that could be possible 
and so it's.

688
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,510
It's fantasy.
We were having fun,

689
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,940
but when you talk to

690
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,160
the leading minds,
when it comes to virtual reality or 

691
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,991
artificial reality or simulation theory,
you know when they start talking about 

692
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:06,971
what will be possible one day they're 
going to without a doubt within a 100 

693
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:11,321
years or 500 years or whatever the 
number is there going to be able to 

694
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:12,740
create an artificial reality.
It's indiscernible from this reality.

695
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,780
You're going to be able to feel things.
There's going to be emotions that come 

696
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:17,780
to you.
You're going,

697
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,720
they're going to be able to recreate 
every single aspect of in everyday life.

698
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,370
It's just a matter of time.
I mean,

699
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:27,371
they're really close now and not.
Not really close in terms of like they 

700
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:28,820
don't give you emotions and they don't 
give you feeling,

701
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:33,821
but if you put on an htc vive and go 
through some of those virtual reality 

702
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:36,650
games,
I mean it's bizarre how real it feels.

703
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,100
And when you go back to like playing 
pong,

704
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,450
did you ever play Polo?
Yeah,

705
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,760
absolutely.
You know,

706
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:48,380
it's such a weird thing that that 
happened inside of me when I was a kid.

707
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,600
Pong came along,
we were blown away.

708
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,860
We couldn't believe that we could 
actually do something on the television.

709
00:31:54,861 --> 00:31:59,000
You could see it move.
It was so fantastic and if you gave that

710
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,680
to one of my kids,
they'd spit on it.

711
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,920
It'd be like,
what kind of pizza shit video game is 

712
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,531
this.
Like they would think it's just so 

713
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:08,531
ridiculous,
but to me at the time it was amazing.

714
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,600
You go from that to one of these htc 
vive games which has all taken place 

715
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,780
within my lifetime and you go,
well,

716
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:19,781
a lifetime from now.
If you follow the exponential increase 

717
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:20,660
in the ability,
the technological innovation,

718
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,000
it's going to be spectacular.
It's going to be.

719
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,520
Absolutely.
So when that does happen,

720
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:30,670
how will you be able to know if it's 
indiscernible how will you know if 

721
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,240
you're in it and how do you know if 
you're not in it right now?

722
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,590
That's the real question,
right?

723
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Yeah.
I mean they'll actually some arguments 

724
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,160
for thinking,
you know,

725
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
this is nick boss than my colleague of 
mine simulation argument

726
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,950
for thinking we are and in late now,
in fact,

727
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:45,060
it's very likely that we should be.
Yeah.

728
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,960
I'm by that.
Um,

729
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,730
I actually,
I'm kind of agnostic.

730
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:52,490
I think you should take the,
the hypothesis seriously.

731
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,090
Um,
but I think the,

732
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:01,610
the argument doesn't quite go through 
for what's attractive and what's not 

733
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,920
attractive about that theory to you.
So his version of it.

734
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,980
Yeah.
So the argument is the frame and if you 

735
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,620
could like his.
So his argument is the,

736
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,120
in the future,
supposing we believe that the human race

737
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:18,080
doesn't go extinct or post humans don't 
go extinct over the next thousand,

738
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,540
few thousand years.
And secondly,

739
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:25,541
that the people in the future have an 
interest in recreating their past just 

740
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:30,671
for kind of historical interest of 
learning that they're going to be 

741
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:30,920
insistent running sync because then it 
got now going to have huge,

742
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:31,910
amazing computer power.

743
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,360
They're going to be able to create 
simulations of the past that,

744
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,470
um,
that to have some interest in running 

745
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,700
simulations of the past.
Well,

746
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,220
the number of,
if that is true,

747
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,830
then the number of simulations that,
uh,

748
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,210
these future people are going to be 
running will vastly outnumber the number

749
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:54,350
of actual timelines that kind of base 
universes at work.

750
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,710
So for the one real universe where 
history,

751
00:33:58,711 --> 00:34:00,830
you're kind of unfolds,
there's also,

752
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:05,180
let's call it 10,000
simulations of that universe.

753
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,960
And if that's true,
then it's the case that well,

754
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:12,380
given that I'm just,
you know,

755
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:17,381
these things nearly all and dishonorable
for the people who are inside them is 

756
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:21,521
overwhelmingly likely just in the base 
plate that I'm going to be in a 

757
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:24,200
simulation rather than I'm in the real 
world.

758
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,870
And what Nick Bostrom says,
actually,

759
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:28,940
it's not that we definitely honest 
simulation,

760
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,320
but he just points out the conflict 
between these three kind of beliefs that

761
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,460
we seem to hold.

762
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,770
One is that we're not going to go 
extinct in the near future too,

763
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:39,530
is that,
you know,

764
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,740
people in the future,
we'll have some interest in simulating 

765
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,080
the past and thirdly that we're not 
living in a simulation and he himself 

766
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:47,630
gives,
you know,

767
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:51,590
a reasonable degree of belief.
Maybe he thinks it's like 10 percent,

768
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,870
15 percent likely that within a 
simulation,

769
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,040
other people who understand the argument
very a bit more,

770
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,400
but I think,
you know,

771
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,250
it's something you should at least be 
taken seriously.

772
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:05,300
Um,
the reason I object it is kind of,

773
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,880
um,
uh,

774
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,840
even weirder.
I think it's somewhat technical,

775
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,990
but the basic thought is just the,
um,

776
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,260
according to like the best guesses from 
Cosmo monogenists,

777
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,950
we're actually in an infinite universe.
The Universe is infinitely big now.

778
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,910
We can't affect an infinitely big 
universe were restricted by the speed of

779
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,010
light to what we can affect and to what 
we can see.

780
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,760
Um,
but the best idea according to the best 

781
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,160
thing that we have universities of keeps
on going,

782
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,120
but if so,
then there's old lady like an infinite 

783
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,041
number of observers of people can have 
in that bottom universe and that means 

784
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:53,421
that you've now got kind of an infinite 
number of people kind of experiencing 

785
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:56,010
things and then you've got the 
simulations and you've got like 10,000

786
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,000
simulations,
but you can't say there's 10,000

787
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,450
times as many simulated beings.
Is that our legal beings?

788
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,260
Because there's already an infinite 
number of beings.

789
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,850
You're looking so good.
Uh,

790
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,620
constantly.
No,

791
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,070
no,
go ahead,

792
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
keep going.
But that means if you've got.

793
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,390
So the key of the,
um,

794
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,540
of Bostrom's argument was that you've 
got 10,000

795
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:23,040
times as many simulated beings as you 
have real like non simulated beings,

796
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:23,510
right?

797
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:28,620
The problem is,
is an infinite number of real beings 

798
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:28,620
because the universe is infinite.

799
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,240
Yeah,
that's right.

800
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,960
And so if you've already got an infinite
number of real beings,

801
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,150
the fact that you've got 10,000
times infinite,

802
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,690
that's still infinite,
right?

803
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,710
You can't.
It's kind of a case where like our best 

804
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,700
methods of assigning degrees of belief 
to things kind of on out.

805
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,170
If you think it's,
you know,

806
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:50,171
there's an infinite number of simulated 
beings and infinite number of real 

807
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:54,320
beings.
Then what's the chance of you being one 

808
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,430
of the other,
like we don't actually have the tools to

809
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:56,120
be able to answer that.

810
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,470
Neil degrasse Tyson was trying to 
explain this to me a couple of weeks ago

811
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:04,530
that there are infinities that are 
bigger than other infinities

812
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,580
yeah.
So that's also the case,

813
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:09,240
but yeah,
that was my roof,

814
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,090
my brain.
And so the number,

815
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,620
but the key,
we're all talking about the lowest was 

816
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:18,620
called cardinality,
the smallest infinity,

817
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:25,520
which is the size of the infinity of all
the integers.

818
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:25,870
One,
two,

819
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:26,290
three,
four.

820
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:31,470
Counting numbers.
And if you take that size of infinity 

821
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,040
and multiply it by 10,000,
let's say you just get the same number,

822
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,350
which is infinity,
right?

823
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,960
Um,
and then what Neil was saying was he had

824
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:39,070
to at least even bigger levels of 
infinity.

825
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,500
So if you look at not just all the 
counting numbers,

826
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:46,501
but all of the numbers,
you can make fractions out of a half a 

827
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:46,750
quarter,
an eighth and so on.

828
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:51,870
That's a bigger.
That's just more numbers than the 

829
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:51,870
infinity of the counting numbers.

830
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,080
I've spent a lot of time trying to 
understand why human beings are so 

831
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:02,091
obsessed with innovation,
why human beings are so obsessed with 

832
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:05,091
technological progress.
And one of the things that I continued 

833
00:38:05,091 --> 00:38:08,451
to come to is that we think of 
everything in this world as being 

834
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:12,891
natural,
but the behavior of butterflies and 

835
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:12,930
wolves and the way rivers run down from 
the mountain.

836
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,740
But we don't think of ourselves and our 
own behavior as natural.

837
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,280
We don't think of our own thirst for 
conquest and innovation and and the even

838
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,980
materialism.
I think materialism is probably a very 

839
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,951
natural reaction to our need to somehow 
or another fuel innovation.

840
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,020
And that.
One of the ways to ensure that 

841
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,641
innovation is constantly fueled is that 
people are constantly obsessed with 

842
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:45,151
buying new things,
constantly obsessed with the latest and 

843
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:48,031
greatest which fuels innovation.
And when you look at the universe itself

844
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:54,060
and you look at all the various things 
that we know to be natural processes in 

845
00:38:55,091 --> 00:39:00,091
the universe,
like tucked in order to make a human 

846
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:00,091
being,
a star has to explode when you literally

847
00:39:00,091 --> 00:39:03,220
are made out of Stardust,
which is when you run that by people for

848
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:04,870
the first time they go,
wait what?

849
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:10,110
Like in order to you for you to have 
carbon based life form that has to be 

850
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,530
created inside a burning,
dying star.

851
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,560
And that's the only way you make this 
thing like what you are right now.

852
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,070
And then that thing makes artificial 
reality.

853
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:22,210
And then that thing makes perhaps even 
crazier.

854
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,470
Makes I mean if you follow the ideas of 
technological progress,

855
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,980
if something gets to a point where it's 
indiscernible from reality,

856
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:34,981
how do you know it's not a new reality?
How do you know it's not a new kind of 

857
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:38,791
reality?
Like Jamie sent me hip to these 

858
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:42,660
artificial worlds that people have 
created online where there essentially 

859
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,500
infinite and they're constantly changing
and morphing and growing.

860
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,010
And the Games are terrible.
People don't like them because you go go

861
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:56,011
to places and there's fucking nothing 
there and you can go to an infinite 

862
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:56,011
number of these places and there's 
nothing there.

863
00:39:56,011 --> 00:39:58,030
Like these adventures are nonexistent,
so you're on these.

864
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,660
You're in these gigantic fake worlds 
where you're traveling from place to 

865
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,221
place,
but right now we're looking at it in a 

866
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:10,710
very two dimensional way.
You're looking at it on a flat screen 

867
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,710
one day.
It's not going to be two dimensional.

868
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:15,511
One day it's going to be something that 
you're interfacing with your 

869
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:19,351
consciousness is interfacing with it.
Is it only real if we can take it and 

870
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,550
drop it on something,
if we can hit it with a hammer,

871
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:29,551
if we could put it on a scale,
if we can use a measuring stick and 

872
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:32,290
measuring,
is it only real there or is it real?

873
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:37,470
If it follows every single check,
like if you check off every single item 

874
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:40,810
on the list of conscious reality and 
conscious experience.

875
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:46,250
I think that's a great question because 
I think the dichotomy that a lot of 

876
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,600
people think in terms of natural and 
unnatural,

877
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:50,500
I think it's just meaningless.
Um,

878
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,550
I mean,
people firstly think this is natural and

879
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:53,700
this is not,
I mean,

880
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:58,080
in a sense everything we're doing is 
natural because we're like homosapiens a

881
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,550
part of a natural process and in 
another,

882
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,340
maybe in another sense everything we're 
doing is not natural.

883
00:41:05,341 --> 00:41:07,230
But then why does that matter?
What's the model?

884
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,830
The relevance of something being natural
versus not natural.

885
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,100
Lots of stuff that happens in the 
natural world is just really awful,

886
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,570
huge amounts of cannibalism.
They like,

887
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,450
um,
uh,

888
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,700
suffering,
so it's not clear why we would care 

889
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,240
about something being natural,
natural.

890
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,230
Um,
but then the second question is,

891
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,380
yeah,
let's consider this a virtual reality 

892
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:33,790
again,
um,

893
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,350
this experience machine that you could 
plug yourself into.

894
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,290
And as part of the description I said,
oh,

895
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:44,291
none of this would be a real.
You'd have all of these interactions 

896
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:44,291
with people that you think are friends 
and so on,

897
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,300
but that wouldn't be avail.
And I think you could very well pushed 

898
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,091
back on that and say why should 
something be physically instantiated?

899
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,620
Like,
uh,

900
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,770
in order for it to count as a real 
experience,

901
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,770
why is it not the case that in this 
virtual reality,

902
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:04,010
your interacting with algorithms,
but that's just as much,

903
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,750
at least it's possible for that to be 
just as much friendship as if you're 

904
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,020
interacting with people who are flesh 
and blood.

905
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,810
And I think it's hard to explain kind of
what the difference would be because you

906
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:19,270
know,
if you think about star trek,

907
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,790
usually quicker,
it can be friends with data and android 

908
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,830
is not kind of bio biological,
but you know,

909
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,240
we think that,
uh,

910
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:34,870
you can still have kind of worth and 
friendships and so on with creatures 

911
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,230
that are not made of kind of human 
biology,

912
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:41,770
in which case,
why is the fact that something merely 

913
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:41,770
lives on silicone?
Why wouldn't.

914
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,440
That was kind of seemingly merely 
software.

915
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,680
What does that mean?
You couldn't have kind of a genuine 

916
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,200
friendship with that thing if it the.
If Actin is sufficiently sophisticated 

917
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,200
way perhaps

918
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,400
isn't there also an issue with are 
incredibly limited ability to view 

919
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,420
reality itself because we're only 
viewing the dimensions that are relevant

920
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:04,080
to us in this current state of carbon 
based life form.

921
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:09,410
This curt,
this is talking monkey claim to the 

922
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,710
spaceship flying through the universe.
This is,

923
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:16,010
this is what's important to us,
but when you pay attention to those 

924
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,430
dudes who write on yellow legal pads and
they get into quantum physics and they 

925
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,670
have all those crazy equations that 
nobody but them understands,

926
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,190
maybe you do.
I look at that shit and I go,

927
00:43:23,191 --> 00:43:26,220
what the fuck are they writing?
But they believe,

928
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,600
I mean,
what is the current model?

929
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:32,710
They,
they believe there's at least 11 

930
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,521
dimensions that perhaps could be more.
What if there is a dimension that you 

931
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:37,290
can plug into that it's purely 
consciousness driven,

932
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,710
meaning there's no physical experience.
There's no touching the ground.

933
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:46,010
There's no gravity,
but you exist in a conscious state and 

934
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,671
it's perpetual.
Like if you take a rocket ship and it 

935
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,020
gets past our gravity and shoots off 
into distance space and you have a clear

936
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:53,130
shot of,
you know,

937
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:58,131
14 billion years back to the beginning 
of the universe itself with nothing in 

938
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:00,590
the way,
you're just going to keep going for $14,

939
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:02,520
billion light years,
you're just going to keep going.

940
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,880
Like,
what if there is a place that your 

941
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:07,880
consciousness can go to like that where 
it can't,

942
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,300
it's no longer burdened by biology,
by the timeline of birth to death,

943
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:17,630
by the limitations of the flesh.
But consciousness itself can exist in 

944
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,360
some bizarre dimension that we just have
an access to.

945
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:22,830
So,
yeah,

946
00:44:22,831 --> 00:44:27,831
I mean,
I think consciousness is probably just 

947
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,020
ultimately a physical process.
Why do you think that in a ultimately 

948
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,620
[inaudible] of a conservation of energy?
Um,

949
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,970
the reason being so,
you know,

950
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,760
this is age,
old philosophical debate between,

951
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,440
um,
the motorists and lists people who think

952
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,480
is consciousness just ultimately some 
sort of physical process or is it 

953
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,400
something special?
So descartes thought there was this,

954
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,470
um,
old grant gland.

955
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,500
There's a little bit of your brain and 
your conscious kind of soul was just 

956
00:44:57,601 --> 00:45:02,601
going to steering your,
like monkey body free with this pineal 

957
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:05,820
gland.
But the question is just for why I think

958
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:10,260
the strongest argument about why that 
couldn't be right is it seems to be like

959
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,670
it would have to be creating energy out 
of nowhere and we've never.

960
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,190
There seems to be just fixed law of the 
universe that just can't happen because 

961
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,740
in order for,
you know,

962
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,430
this conscious mind to,
if it's not merely a physical process,

963
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:31,431
if it's not just the brain,
in order for that to be able to effect 

964
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:34,611
what this physical entity is doing,
it would have to use energy to be able 

965
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:34,611
to do that.

966
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:40,110
So the energy would have to be coming 
from somewhere and if it's not coming 

967
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:43,531
from just the physical realm,
then suddenly we've got this counter 

968
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:43,531
examples to all the rest of science

969
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:48,710
sort of.
But you aware of the theories of human 

970
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,290
neurotransmitters being pathways to 
other dimensions,

971
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:52,630
like dimethyltryptamine didn't know 
about all that.

972
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:53,950
Um,
I mean,

973
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:58,951
I know about the empty.
Do you know what it's produced in the 

974
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:01,141
pineal gland where descartes thought 
that all that stuff was going on the 

975
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:02,830
seat of the soul with the Egyptians 
called the eye of horus.

976
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:08,220
The reason why the Catholics and so many
ancient religions were so focused on 

977
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,050
pine cones and their,
their art and their,

978
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,100
their imagery.
That's the pineal gland.

979
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,070
That's the image of it.
That's what it's supposed to represent.

980
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:20,310
And for people who've had these intense,
transformative psychedelic experiences 

981
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,870
by consuming exogenous 
dimethyltryptamine,

982
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,110
which is produced by the brain that you 
have these insane,

983
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:31,111
transformative experiences where you 
feel like you are traveling to other 

984
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:31,111
dimensions.
Yeah.

985
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:31,960
So I think,
I mean,

986
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:33,790
I do want to say like,
have you done any of that?

987
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,290
Um,
I've never done DMT,

988
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,230
son of eventual not what are you doing?
You're wasting your time.

989
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,860
I know that's a good way,
but,

990
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,920
but it's something that's in the brain.
I mean,

991
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:46,720
it's a natural product of a human 
biology.

992
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:51,830
I mean,
whether it's natural or not isn't the 

993
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:51,830
question just,
uh,

994
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,860
you know,
if I'm going to have a career based on 

995
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:54,860
my brain,
I want to be very careful to,

996
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,690
to not break it,
to not be okay.

997
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:55,860
Yeah.

998
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,120
Yeah.
But it's one of the most transient drugs

999
00:46:58,121 --> 00:47:03,121
ever observed in the body.
Your body brings it back to baseline in 

1000
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:03,121
like 15 minutes.

1001
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:03,121
Hmm.
Okay.

1002
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:03,160
Is that,
um,

1003
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,570
because I mean,
there's a lot of.

1004
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,230
I do think there's like tons of people 
very often,

1005
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,810
greatly overestimate the risks of 
nonlegal blogs,

1006
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,000
like mdms like super safe and so on.

1007
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,690
Very overestimate the list,
the risks that you're saying.

1008
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,490
Yeah.
That's the MTMA yeah.

1009
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,210
Yeah.
Is Weird,

1010
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,230
right?
That's a weird one.

1011
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,040
It's not a natural drug.
Dimethyltryptamine.

1012
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:30,130
I think the real concern would be 
psychological because what you face

1013
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,130
is so bizarre.
Terence Mckenna Mckenna had the best 

1014
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:35,130
quote about it.
I think he said that,

1015
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,690
uh,
you would risk death by astonishment.

1016
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,550
Yeah.
Okay.

1017
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:40,320
So their thing.
Well,

1018
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:45,380
it's a,
it's so bizarre that it's almost a sin 

1019
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,030
for a guy as smart as you did not 
experience it,

1020
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,530
but will you just come right back and 
you're,

1021
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,900
even when you're there,
you're there mean to you.

1022
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:54,901
It's not like you,
your consciousness dissolves into some 

1023
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:59,310
bizarre quasi living state and then you 
have to like work your way back to being

1024
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,670
you again.
Now you're,

1025
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:03,790
you.
You're will macaskill in the dimension,

1026
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,940
whatever the fuck it is.
But what's crazy about it is that this 

1027
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,421
is produced in the very area where 
descartes was believing the seat of the 

1028
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:15,060
soul is in so many different eastern 
religions and all,

1029
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:19,630
all this psychological,
like all these different,

1030
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:25,290
all these different religions and all 
these different cultures,

1031
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,840
they were all convinced at that one 
gland had some massive significance in 

1032
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:34,690
terms of the spirit and the soul,
whatever that means.

1033
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,250
Whatever spirit means.
So yeah.

1034
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:38,860
So then the question is just in these 
experiences,

1035
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:44,250
is it the case that you'll like seeing 
into genuinely seeing into another 

1036
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,391
dimension,
or is it the case that just have a new 

1037
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:50,971
kind of perspective on consciousness?
So one thing I do think is that in terms

1038
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:56,161
of conscious experience,
this the sort of conscious experiences 

1039
00:48:56,161 --> 00:48:58,801
that humans have access to,
and I think that must just be point 

1040
00:48:58,801 --> 00:48:58,801
zero,
zero,

1041
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:01,690
one percent of the entire landscape of 
possible conscious experiences.

1042
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,220
So if you think,
imagine if you have a bat and you could 

1043
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,091
echo locate,
that's just a radically different 

1044
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:12,121
conscious experience.
I don't think that maps on to any sort 

1045
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:12,121
of conscious experience that humans 
could have.

1046
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:14,890
Have you seen people do that?
Blind people can do that.

1047
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:16,630
It's pretty amazing.
That is amazing.

1048
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:19,180
Very effectively too.
It's like shockingly effectively.

1049
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:22,210
Yeah,
I think you're absolutely right.

1050
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,980
I mean,
but there's also experiences,

1051
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:28,981
human experiences that are available 
without drugs that some people have 

1052
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:31,930
achieved through radical states of 
meditation and Kundalini Yoga where they

1053
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:34,300
could achieve natural psychedelic 
states,

1054
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,180
holotropic breathing,
people that have done that.

1055
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:42,181
I've experienced like really radical 
psychological transformations and 

1056
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:44,500
incredible psychedelic experiences from 
that as well.

1057
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,840
Yeah.
And so I think like,

1058
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:51,980
um,
these sorts of experiences are very 

1059
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:51,980
important,
very interesting.

1060
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,590
Um,
and what they,

1061
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
you know,
I said that maybe we experienced this 

1062
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,181
point zero,
one percent of all possible conscious 

1063
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:02,191
experiences and that just allows you to 
do like see a little bit more of this 

1064
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:03,610
potential vast landscape.
Uh,

1065
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:08,980
well as I think,
but I think there's nothing on magical 

1066
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,181
about saying ultimately that's all 
explained in terms of physics in terms 

1067
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:15,481
of um,
different sorts of neurons firing and 

1068
00:50:15,481 --> 00:50:15,760
differences once have a transmit as and 
so on.

1069
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:17,500
We don't need to say,
oh,

1070
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:22,501
and it's also this other thing which 
breaks all the known laws of physics 

1071
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:25,060
that you're seeing into some other 
dimension.

1072
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,130
In order for that to be an incredibly 
important thing.

1073
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:33,020
I'm a as unscientific to say we know 
almost nothing about consciousness in 

1074
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,240
terms of the areas of scientific 
inquiry.

1075
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,630
We have no understanding at all about 
the relationship between conscious 

1076
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,100
experiences and um,
you know,

1077
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,790
what we would think of as physical 
processes.

1078
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,190
We really have no idea about,
you know,

1079
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:54,250
if you take,
give me any sufficiently complicated 

1080
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:54,250
physical processes,
which,

1081
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:58,441
uh,
which are conscious and which are not 

1082
00:50:58,441 --> 00:50:58,441
all we can go on is really,
that's what I'm conscious.

1083
00:50:58,441 --> 00:51:03,370
And so I know the things that kind of 
liked me or probably conscious too and 

1084
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,080
that's the best we've got really.
Um,

1085
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,960
and this is known as a hard problem of 
consciousness and force.

1086
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,980
It was often say they've solved it with 
something and I think it's always 

1087
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,121
begging the question.
I think we should be very open to the 

1088
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:17,630
fact that I'm just as in um,
you know,

1089
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,780
3000 BC people had no idea about the 
laws of physics.

1090
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:23,030
This was just completely unexplored 
territory.

1091
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,690
We should think contemporary science,
this is just a big,

1092
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,840
like a big black gap in our scientific 
understanding.

1093
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,580
And perhaps it's something maybe 21st 
century science,

1094
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:37,790
maybe 22nd century science can really 
get to grips with.

1095
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,570
Yeah.
It does seem like the ultimate question,

1096
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:45,110
like what is it for,
why is it here?

1097
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,510
What controls it?
Is it in the mind?

1098
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:52,570
Is it external?
Is the brain just to an antenna that 

1099
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:56,321
tunes into consciousness?
The dimethyltryptamine question is so 

1100
00:51:56,541 --> 00:52:01,541
bizarre because it's the most potent 
psychedelic drug known to man and your 

1101
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:01,541
brain man.

1102
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,900
Except for I didn't know if this is a 
myth I've heard.

1103
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:06,940
It's what gets made when you die.

1104
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:07,830
Yeah.
The third,

1105
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:12,890
they believe that during high rates of 
stress where your body believes you're 

1106
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,540
going to die and when your dreaming,
when you're in heavy rem sleep,

1107
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:17,810
your body produces larger amounts of it 
than,

1108
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:20,820
than baseline.
But they don't know.

1109
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,590
It's,
it's really difficult.

1110
00:52:22,591 --> 00:52:25,230
They've only just now within the last 
few years,

1111
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,510
the Cottonwood Research Foundation,
which,

1112
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,740
uh,
uh,

1113
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,590
Dr Rick Strassman has a big part of it.
He's the guy who wrote the book Dmt,

1114
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:38,490
the spirit molecule.
He did a bunch of the first FDA approved

1115
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:44,150
drug trials with civilians where they 
took people and they gave them a 

1116
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,250
schedule,
one drug dimethyltryptamine,

1117
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,640
which is so crazy that it's a schedule 
one drug that your body produces,

1118
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:55,641
but they gave it to be bull 
intravenously over the course of several

1119
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,480
months.
And they documented all the different 

1120
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:02,480
trips and all the different.
Um,

1121
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,060
the different commonalities that these 
people had in their experiences and he's

1122
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:11,541
working very closely with the cottonwood
research foundation and one of the 

1123
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:14,571
things that they found is that they've 
recently discovered it was just 

1124
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:15,450
anecdotal evidence that it was produced 
by the pineal gland.

1125
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,390
We knew the DMT was produced by the 
liver and the lungs,

1126
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,600
but now they know for sure because 
they've isolated it in rats.

1127
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,840
So in living rats,
they know that they produce dmt with the

1128
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:25,860
gland.
So that,

1129
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,690
that explains a lot of,
you know,

1130
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:32,870
ancient eastern mysticism and all the 
symbology this holy symbols that people 

1131
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:37,020
had to represent this gland.
Now they know,

1132
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:42,021
okay,
well this is definitely does produce 

1133
00:53:42,021 --> 00:53:42,021
this incredibly potent psychedelic drug.
But now the cross,

1134
00:53:42,021 --> 00:53:46,230
the question is at what levels during 
what periods of stress,

1135
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:51,290
like how do you have to bring someone to
the point of death before they 

1136
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,230
experienced this?
And if that is the case,

1137
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:56,370
is it possible that consciousness itself
is something that we,

1138
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,320
you know,
since we haven't really figured out what

1139
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:03,321
exactly it is,
is it possible that consciousness can 

1140
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:06,741
travel through this chemical pathway 
that maybe these intense 

1141
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:11,660
dimethyltryptamine experiences are in 
fact a gateway to what people have 

1142
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,460
assumed exists from the beginning of 
time,

1143
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:18,150
like an afterlife or a sea of souls or 
something,

1144
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:23,151
some,
some stage of existence other than this 

1145
00:54:23,151 --> 00:54:24,840
physical existence that we all 
experience right now.

1146
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,260
Yeah.
So I mean,

1147
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,260
I feel like I'd be crazy talk,
right?

1148
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,370
It's as big they see

1149
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,200
coming out of my mouth.
I'm going,

1150
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,880
what the fuck are you talking about?
Dude?

1151
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:39,850
I mean I think I just be suppliers of 
consciousness was just this one 

1152
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,601
chemical.
I think it's much more likely that 

1153
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:44,701
something is this emergent phenomena 
from this incredibly complex system of,

1154
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:49,810
you know,
billions of different neurons filing in 

1155
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:52,231
a certain way and when you have a 
certain process that sufficiently 

1156
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:55,010
complex in the right way somehow,
and this is just this big black box that

1157
00:54:55,011 --> 00:55:00,011
we've got no idea about,
somehow subjective experience comes out 

1158
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:00,250
of that.
But it would seem,

1159
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,700
I mean otherwise the issue is you could 
have just dmt to traveling and just a 

1160
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,330
test tube or something and petri dish 
and it would seem like,

1161
00:55:07,331 --> 00:55:08,920
oh,
is this petri dish?

1162
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,650
I'm conscious that would seem the least 
lane.

1163
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,140
Why would that be the case?
If you're breathing air and you're,

1164
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:16,970
you know,
the air keeps you alive,

1165
00:55:16,971 --> 00:55:21,971
like you're breathing in and breathing 
that you don't think that air carries 

1166
00:55:21,971 --> 00:55:22,020
the life with it to another place.
Right.

1167
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,340
Era is just a component of life.
It's something that your body requires.

1168
00:55:25,341 --> 00:55:25,520
Yeah.

1169
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,620
So I mean it's possible.
Maybe it's the case though.

1170
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:33,621
Again,
I feel I'd be surprised if it was like 

1171
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:33,621
this chemical is necessary for 
consciousness and stuff.

1172
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:37,880
I'm not saying that's necessarily,
but what I am curious as to how 

1173
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,000
consciousness varies.
Consciousness,

1174
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:44,330
consciousness and the actual feeling of 
being alive varies depending upon your 

1175
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:46,170
health.
Depending behind stress levels,

1176
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,440
depending upon love and happiness and 
all these different factors change the 

1177
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:56,511
way you view the world,
which is really interesting because in 

1178
00:55:56,511 --> 00:55:59,100
in effect that change is consciousness 
and you can be more.

1179
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,110
You know,
you can be more elevated,

1180
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:06,111
like you can guarantee you all of this 
effect of altruism that you're 

1181
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:10,551
concentrating on is somehow another 
elevating your consciousness because 

1182
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:13,761
you're putting out so much love and so 
much happiness and you are helping so 

1183
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:18,621
many people.
There's so many positive benefits to 

1184
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:18,621
your very existence.
I've got to manage,

1185
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:23,601
I've got to believe rather than somehow 
or another that manages to come back to 

1186
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:23,601
you.

1187
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:24,130
I,
it definitely comes back

1188
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,070
to me in kind of how I feel about my 
life.

1189
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,290
I mean,
when we were talking about how,

1190
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,020
uh,
you know,

1191
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,460
money is just not the key to a happy 
life.

1192
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:34,030
The question is,
well,

1193
00:56:34,031 --> 00:56:39,031
what is,
and the answers are having a great 

1194
00:56:39,031 --> 00:56:39,031
community,
um,

1195
00:56:39,031 --> 00:56:41,590
having a greater purpose in life,
feeling like you're making a difference.

1196
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,730
So all of these reasons of why.
So we've built up this kind of community

1197
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:47,960
around effective altruism.
Um,

1198
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:53,100
you know,
people all around the world who are 

1199
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:53,100
making a significant change.
So for example,

1200
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,361
donating 10 percent of the income to the
charities they think are most effective 

1201
00:56:57,361 --> 00:56:58,630
or pursuing a career that we think is 
really effective.

1202
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,360
And one thing I wasn't surprising from 
the outset,

1203
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:05,200
but I'm so happy happened is that 
there's a strong community is formed.

1204
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:10,201
It's kind of like a little global 
village or something and people have 

1205
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:13,420
found the actually far from being a 
sacrifice as you might have expected,

1206
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:18,010
was actually incredibly rewarding 
because you've now got this community of

1207
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:23,011
people who have shared aims to you and 
you're all working towards this greater 

1208
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:23,830
goal.

1209
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,860
And that's something that I think is 
very lacking in the world today.

1210
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:31,360
So many people just,
they work nine to five and you know,

1211
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:34,230
they have a nice time on the weekends,
but they're like,

1212
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:39,270
where there's all of this going and at 
the end of my life am I really going to 

1213
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:39,270
think,
yeah,

1214
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:43,620
I made the most of this.
Whereas if you think at the end of your 

1215
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:43,620
life like,
Yup,

1216
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:47,581
I dedicated my life to helping others 
and I had this transformative impact on 

1217
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:51,961
thousands of people,
you're not going to think at the end of 

1218
00:57:51,961 --> 00:57:51,961
your life,
Gee,

1219
00:57:51,961 --> 00:57:56,100
I really wasted that.
It's just something I don't think you 

1220
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,011
can really look at.
If you go deep though down the 

1221
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:01,401
philosophical rabbit hole and you really
consider that life is this temporary 

1222
00:58:02,671 --> 00:58:07,671
experience and even benefiting someone 
through this temporary experience is 

1223
00:58:07,671 --> 00:58:12,081
still a temporary experience.
It's like you are helping somebody gave 

1224
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:15,291
them a pillow for the ride and it's a 
temporary ride and the ride comes to an 

1225
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:19,731
end and then what?
And then what is the point of all this 

1226
00:58:19,731 --> 00:58:22,791
like what is the point of effective 
altruism if you're just helping people 

1227
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,000
during this temporary ride,
it doesn't seem to

1228
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,430
mean anything.
Yeah.

1229
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,340
So I think there's two things.
Um,

1230
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,370
I like it.
I have loads.

1231
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,320
I can do that too.
Just raise up.

1232
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:36,820
I just go with the.
It was freak myself out.

1233
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,130
Well,
we do get freaked out at this,

1234
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,780
you know,
when you think of cosmic is essential 

1235
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,800
and so thanks to existence.
So I think there's two.

1236
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,530
I think it was two emphasis yet.
Okay.

1237
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,980
The first is that the light is the goal.
Ultimately,

1238
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:59,340
again,
if you think the purpose of life is to 

1239
00:58:59,340 --> 00:58:59,340
increase the amount of happiness and the
juice,

1240
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:03,481
the amount of suffering,
the final goal is good experiences and 

1241
00:59:03,481 --> 00:59:04,120
the kind of anti goal is bad 
experiences.

1242
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,000
So when we're sitting here talking,
having a great time,

1243
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,360
this is us kind of achieving getting 
points in the wind.

1244
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:13,430
I'm counter so we're having to just 
time.

1245
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,140
That's like,
yeah,

1246
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:16,240
if we were really hating this then we'd 
be losing.

1247
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:21,320
Well even more so because we're 
broadcasting this live and millions of 

1248
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,720
people are gonna hear it and hopefully 
not having hopefully that enjoying it.

1249
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:28,750
Hopefully,
and maybe if they're not at least a 

1250
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:28,750
little stress relief,
like maybe they're at the gym and I go,

1251
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:31,160
these fucking idiots when they're doing 
squats and they're getting angry.

1252
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,980
Yeah,
so I think that's the first thing,

1253
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,760
but then the second thing is I'm late to
this idea of cosmic significance where 

1254
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,840
Juan often motivate.
So you say,

1255
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:45,280
Oh,
well we're just along for the ride.

1256
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,740
We're all going to get eaten up by the 
sun eventually and so on.

1257
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:53,010
What's the calculator?
Purpose of life by actually think what 

1258
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:56,551
are some ways that our actions now can 
have much greater cosmic significance 

1259
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:02,730
and that's if that's because I think if 
you think that the human race survives 

1260
01:00:04,571 --> 01:00:09,571
for the next few centuries,
it seems kind of inevitable that we're 

1261
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:10,060
going to spend to the stars.
Um,

1262
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:12,250
and I think that would be good.
Again,

1263
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:17,251
from this perspective,
we can go into more arguments if you 

1264
01:00:17,251 --> 01:00:19,891
want,
of just saying what we want to do is 

1265
01:00:19,891 --> 01:00:21,871
promote happiness and reduce suffering.
If that means we can live on other 

1266
01:00:22,211 --> 01:00:25,210
planets as well and have kind of fiving 
civilizations there.

1267
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:30,570
Not only were the people are having 
great lives but also making scientific 

1268
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:33,850
artistic contributions and so on,
then that's a good thing to do as well.

1269
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:39,870
Well,
there's no technological reason for 

1270
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:39,870
thinking that we won't be able to do 
that in the future.

1271
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:44,280
I'm given current late to technological 
progress unless something really bad 

1272
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,330
happens along the way,
and this kind of gets back to one of the

1273
01:00:46,331 --> 01:00:51,331
things we talked about right at the 
start was one of the focus areas of the 

1274
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:54,650
effective altruism community is on 
turnover.

1275
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,000
Juice risks from,
of human extinction,

1276
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:01,900
of global catastrophic risks.
These are the sorts of things that could

1277
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:07,000
imperil the human journey as it were.
Um,

1278
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,330
and I think if you're working to 
mitigate some of these things,

1279
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,500
then you're increasing the chance that 
we do get to the sort of level where,

1280
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,840
um,
he,

1281
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,600
yeah,
humanity can have a five in the future,

1282
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:22,540
not just on this planet but on other 
planets as well.

1283
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,960
And that actually means your actions 
really do have this huge cosmic 

1284
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,160
significance.
So the conscious effort to be

1285
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:31,920
kind,
person,

1286
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:36,921
a generous person and effective altruism
spreads and it impacts people.

1287
01:01:37,051 --> 01:01:42,051
There's this ripple effect and your good
deeds could perhaps fuel enough people 

1288
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:49,370
with this thought and with effective 
altruism and more people might act on 

1289
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:54,261
that to the point where we reduced the 
amount of suffering to the point where 

1290
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:57,711
we extend the lifespan of human beings.
We extend the areas where we have no 

1291
01:01:58,111 --> 01:02:00,720
war.
We reduced the amount of violence to the

1292
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:05,721
point where we can successfully innovate
to the point where we can get off this 

1293
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:05,721
planet.
That's that.

1294
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,440
And then start from scratch with a new 
dictator on Mars,

1295
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,780
Donald Trump on Mars.
How about that?

1296
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:10,890
Um,
yeah.

1297
01:02:10,891 --> 01:02:12,290
I mean,
so I think the boat,

1298
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:16,230
none.
Mars will become president of Mas.

1299
01:02:16,231 --> 01:02:18,660
I'd be pretty happy with that.
Be Fascinating if we'd have to go to war

1300
01:02:18,661 --> 01:02:19,410
with Maurice.
Yeah.

1301
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,860
Do you think though the.

1302
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:23,430
I mean I've wondered about this many,
many times.

1303
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:26,640
I wonder if it's an outdated idea,
this idea of traveling to the stars.

1304
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:32,030
And again,
I go back to this whole inter 

1305
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:32,640
dimensional thing that I wonder if 
that's the reason why we have never been

1306
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:36,270
visited by other planets,
by species from another planet.

1307
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,960
Maybe that's not what happens.
Maybe they develop artificial realities.

1308
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:45,100
Maybe like Jamie was talking about to me
with these artificial computer 

1309
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,060
realities.
Like if,

1310
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:51,140
if someone develops some sort of a 
matrix like world where you can plug 

1311
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,461
into an experience and an infinite 
number of things in an infinite number 

1312
01:02:55,461 --> 01:02:58,260
of artificially created dimensions that 
are indistinguishable from this,

1313
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:03,980
why would you want to like risk a six 
month trip and a metal tube to another 

1314
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,640
planet?
I mean maybe that's really retro.

1315
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:08,100
Maybe that's a really ancient way of 
looking at things.

1316
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:11,610
Maybe it's like Zepplins,
like big flying balloons instead of,

1317
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:12,310
you know,

1318
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:17,710
so yeah,
the question you raised is called the 

1319
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:18,650
Fermi paradox,
which is just given this.

1320
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:23,680
So 100 billion stars in our galaxy,
m 8 billion galaxies in the effect 

1321
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:27,950
double universe,
100 billion in the observable universe.

1322
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:31,430
Uh,
the nfs is also the old 15 billion years

1323
01:03:31,431 --> 01:03:36,431
old.
So if it was the case that life is very 

1324
01:03:36,431 --> 01:03:38,700
common that it's very easy for us to,
um,

1325
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:43,400
life to then developed a level of 
advanced technological ability.

1326
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:46,850
We should expect to see evidence of 
aliens all over the Bronx.

1327
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:52,120
But yet we see absolutely none.
And that means that from somewhere from 

1328
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:56,340
a habitable planet,
somewhere along the path from habitable 

1329
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,760
planet to um,
you kind of space fanning civilization,

1330
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:04,120
there must be some big filter.
There must be some step that's just 

1331
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,201
incredibly hard for that to have it.
And can I be unlikely that civilization 

1332
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,550
musome or life moves from that step to 
another.

1333
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,310
And one hypothesis is this,
yeah,

1334
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:18,430
like people just society.
Civilization gets to sufficiently 

1335
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:21,320
advanced level and they just chill out.
They just go internally.

1336
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,370
Yeah.
They go and tunnel.

1337
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:27,320
The issue with that explanation I think 
is it's just not long enough because,

1338
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:30,590
you know,
you'd have to think that that's for this

1339
01:04:30,591 --> 01:04:33,260
kind of filter to work has to be able to
really filter.

1340
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,550
Filter.
Yeah.

1341
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:37,550
As in like,
because there's so many stars,

1342
01:04:37,551 --> 01:04:40,820
so many earth,
so many seemingly habitable planets.

1343
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:46,380
Um,
it has to be the case that it's 

1344
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,020
exceptionally unlikely at some stage of 
other like,

1345
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,850
and not just really unlikely as in like,
you know,

1346
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:53,960
one in a trillion,
unlikely to,

1347
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:59,290
on this path for them,
habitable planet to space fading 

1348
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:00,860
civilization.
And so you'd have to think of a trillion

1349
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:04,250
civilizations that get to this level of 
technological ability,

1350
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,230
the old shoes to turn inward.

1351
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:08,690
And that seems very unlikely.
It seems like,

1352
01:05:08,691 --> 01:05:11,420
well,
at least one word really spread out.

1353
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,750
And if so,
then we'd see evidence of that.

1354
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:19,100
Um,
because cosmically speaking the time for

1355
01:05:19,101 --> 01:05:24,101
them,
I'm getting to the level of 

1356
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:26,191
technological capability where you can 
spend to the stars and the level where 

1357
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,550
we'd be able to get to see real evidence
of that is kind of small.

1358
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
So I actually think that the reason that
we can't see aliens is because the very 

1359
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:41,011
first stages of life and incredibly 
unlikely the move from nothing to kind 

1360
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:46,551
of basic application.
And then secondly to move from single 

1361
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,400
celled organisms to multicellular 
organisms.

1362
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:54,300
And the reason for thinking this is very
unlikely is it took an incredibly long 

1363
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,201
time.
I'm on earth billions of years before 

1364
01:05:58,201 --> 01:06:01,501
this happened and in particular in the 
move from single cell to multi-celled 

1365
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:01,870
life,
that's only ever happened once.

1366
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:06,280
And so given that we don't see any 
aliens,

1367
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:08,530
we should think some part of this is 
really hard.

1368
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,720
Our best guess is that,
that,

1369
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:16,140
that move them single cell to 
multi-celled and perhaps from the 

1370
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,160
creation of the first cells as well,
that was incredibly difficult.

1371
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:23,780
Um,
and that means that we're just 

1372
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:23,780
exceptionally lucky to be alive as it 
were.

1373
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:24,430
But

1374
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:29,550
if the universe is infinite,
that means that this has happened in 

1375
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:29,740
infinite number of times.

1376
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,550
That's what I though it might be very 
far away.

1377
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:36,510
Probably like sufficiently far the way 
that we are not connectable to eat.

1378
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:38,730
Like we can't contact each other,
observe each other.

1379
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,190
But there's an infinite number of those 
infinitely far places.

1380
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,550
Yes,
there will be some.

1381
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,900
There will be some like clusters of the 
universe and again,

1382
01:06:49,901 --> 01:06:52,570
the idea that the universe is infinite.
Certainly a hypothesis,

1383
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:55,210
and I'm just deferring to other people 
who say it's the leading.

1384
01:06:55,350 --> 01:07:00,350
Well,
the most puzzling hypothesis to me was 

1385
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:04,311
the evidence of supermassive black holes
being at the center of every galaxy and 

1386
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:10,050
that the hypothesis was that the 
supermassive black holes are exactly one

1387
01:07:10,051 --> 01:07:12,480
half of one percent of the mass,
the entire galaxy.

1388
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,420
And then if you go through those 
supermassive black holes,

1389
01:07:15,421 --> 01:07:20,421
you may in fact go into a completely new
universe filled with hundreds of 

1390
01:07:20,421 --> 01:07:25,041
billions of galaxies,
each with supermassive black holes at 

1391
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,401
the center of those galaxies,
which will take you to hundreds of 

1392
01:07:28,401 --> 01:07:29,040
billions of galaxies in another 
universe.

1393
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:33,180
And that it's never ending.
And that's what the real infinity is.

1394
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,480
It's not just the mass of all the things
that we can observe in the 14 plus 

1395
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,070
billion light years that we know of from
the Big Bang to today.

1396
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:46,400
It's all of those things being portals 
to incredibly different.

1397
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,100
Totally new universes.
Okay.

1398
01:07:50,101 --> 01:07:52,470
So it's turtles all the way down.
Turtles all the way down.

1399
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,500
So the.
The real question to me,

1400
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,890
and this I had,
I proposed this to Brian Cox,

1401
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:03,891
I didn't get a sufficient answer.
It's why would we assume that there's 

1402
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:09,290
someone more advanced than us?
Like it is possible that someone,

1403
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:14,660
some species,
some thing is the tip of the spear that 

1404
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,100
some thing is the first,

1405
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:20,300
that something is the most advanced life
form in the universe.

1406
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:25,010
Why would we assume that someone would 
be more advanced than us?

1407
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:27,680
If we are the most advanced thing that 
we can find?

1408
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:31,210
The only logic that I could point to was
that,

1409
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:36,211
that we're relatively young in terms of 
the history and the age of the universe 

1410
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:40,571
itself.
The university itself being roughly 14 

1411
01:08:40,571 --> 01:08:40,970
billion years old.
We are four point six.

1412
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,190
What do we.
What is the age of the earth?

1413
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:44,620
Somewhere,
somewhere in there,

1414
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,130
somewhere in the neighborhood,
right.

1415
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:51,520
Relatively young.
When you consider that 10 billion years 

1416
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,311
of life give or take happen or,
or existence happened before we came 

1417
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:59,381
along,
why would we assume that there's 

1418
01:08:59,381 --> 01:09:02,441
anything out there that's more advanced 
and why would we assume that this isn't 

1419
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:03,710
as far as anybody's ever gotten?
I mean,

1420
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:06,650
that's so in terms of infinity,
right?

1421
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:09,470
Fourteen billion years seems like a long
time,

1422
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,810
but in terms of infinity,
it's a blink.

1423
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:15,080
So I think we should believe that in 
the.

1424
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:20,560
And again,
let's now just fits the infinity and 

1425
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:20,560
just think about the observable 
universe,

1426
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,640
which is finite because people pulled 
over sweating in their car right now.

1427
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:23,020
Yeah.
Yeah,

1428
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,500
exactly.
Infinity.

1429
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:29,180
Have you ever heard of claims number?
This is not a total digression of claims

1430
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:31,540
number.
I don't believe so.

1431
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,380
It was known as um,
uh,

1432
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,730
the largest number ever.
Seriously used in the mathematical proof

1433
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,330
and the table and of wait.
But why has this amazing post?

1434
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,570
I'm trying to explain just how big could
I am's number.

1435
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:49,571
It is.
And I think you have to use a special 

1436
01:09:49,571 --> 01:09:49,571
notation and what's to be able to 
explain it.

1437
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:53,390
The numbers just get really big and once
you really start to think this through,

1438
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:56,390
you're just like your left,
just kind of rocking back and forth.

1439
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,880
Um,
yeah.

1440
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:01,180
No,
like just peeked out.

1441
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:02,640
Yeah.
For the little monkey,

1442
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:07,890
Lillian is so big affiliate.
It's just a speck of dust compared to 

1443
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:09,290
even a trillion years,
a speck of dust.

1444
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:14,320
When you consider the possibility of the
universe itself being infinite or the 

1445
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,230
possibility that is a continuous cycle 
of big bangs to expansion,

1446
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:21,590
to contraction back to an infinitely 
small point,

1447
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:24,590
back to another big bang,
which is a plausible possibility.

1448
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:25,820
Yeah.
I mean,

1449
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,100
I think,
yeah.

1450
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:28,940
I'm also,
I'm fairly.

1451
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:29,420
Well,
you know,

1452
01:10:29,421 --> 01:10:31,330
I'm not,
I'm not neil degrasse Tyson,

1453
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,100
a butch thing,
tons of the science.

1454
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:39,370
I think my understanding of the moment 
is that we currently think that the 

1455
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:40,580
universe is just expanding and it just 
keeps expanding.

1456
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,540
I know it's definitely a leading theory 
that it was going to expand and slow and

1457
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:45,850
then kind of on.
Yes.

1458
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:51,220
Um,
but you mentioned a humans being the 

1459
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:51,740
most advanced kind of cliche.

1460
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:56,300
I think that probably is correct in the 
observable or certainly our galaxy,

1461
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:59,570
let's say in our.
Well we know it is in our solar system,

1462
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:00,470
right?
Yeah,

1463
01:11:00,471 --> 01:11:05,471
that's right.
But I think we know it isn't our galaxy 

1464
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:05,471
as well.
I think so.

1465
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,240
And again the nice so far.
But the thing is that,

1466
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,310
um,
it's far as in it's like 100,000

1467
01:11:10,311 --> 01:11:15,311
light years thinking about,
but when you're thinking about 15 

1468
01:11:15,311 --> 01:11:18,570
billion years of age of the universe,
that's actually just a very short period

1469
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:21,150
of time.
But why would you assume that 100,000

1470
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:24,690
light years from now there is not 
something exactly like us.

1471
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:28,530
So it's possible.
But the thing is that if it was somewhat

1472
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:33,531
easy or if it was just not incredibly 
difficult for intelligent life to 

1473
01:11:33,531 --> 01:11:37,431
evolve,
then it would have happened in the past 

1474
01:11:37,431 --> 01:11:39,531
already and we will see evidence of it 
and the fact that we don't see any 

1475
01:11:39,531 --> 01:11:43,060
evidence at all of intelligent life and 
other solar systems or,

1476
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:48,100
and like a toll a suggest.
It's incredibly difficult for that to 

1477
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:52,341
happen.
But isn't that like being in the woods 

1478
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,670
and unzipping your tent and sticking 
your head out and saying,

1479
01:11:53,671 --> 01:11:55,890
I don't see anything.
This must be empty woods.

1480
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:59,040
Um,
it's more like,

1481
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:05,980
I mean,
you're talking about a very small area 

1482
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,750
that you've observed and we've taken 
account of.

1483
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:11,280
So I think it's more like,
um,

1484
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,050
because I think

1485
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:17,790
if an alien civilization or us in the 
future goes to kind of start,

1486
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,950
um,
uh,

1487
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:23,520
yeah,
spending to the stars in the course of,

1488
01:12:23,521 --> 01:12:24,540
you know,
uh,

1489
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,130
just a few seconds,
million years,

1490
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:30,990
let's say there'll be nearly significant
evidence you'd see dyson's spheres being

1491
01:12:30,991 --> 01:12:32,900
constructed around sons,
you know,

1492
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:37,950
to harness the sun's energy.
You'd see some evidence of like 

1493
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,000
dialectic engineering projects and so 
on.

1494
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:44,150
It'd be like a really big impact.
You'd see that with hundreds of 

1495
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:47,010
thousands of light years between us and 
the observable objects,

1496
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,690
again,
100,000

1497
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:52,100
light years is just not very long.
Um,

1498
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:57,470
compared to the kind of 15 billion.
So it would just be this amazing 

1499
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:01,581
coincidence if it's the case that he,
a life that's as advanced and more 

1500
01:13:01,581 --> 01:13:06,150
advanced than us has a voltage,
just the same time as us were 100,000

1501
01:13:06,151 --> 01:13:11,151
years,
give or take is basically just the same 

1502
01:13:11,151 --> 01:13:13,371
time but hasn't evolved in the past,
hasn't involved more than a million 

1503
01:13:13,371 --> 01:13:16,590
years ago where we will start to see 
kind of major impact of that.

1504
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:21,120
So if something within the observable 
universe we've observed so little,

1505
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:26,210
we don't even have really adequate 
photographs of anything outside of our 

1506
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:29,121
solar system.
I mean everything is just radio 

1507
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:29,121
spectrum,
you know,

1508
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:30,960
these,
the analysis is that they're getting off

1509
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:34,920
of light waves of what the components of
the atmosphere is.

1510
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:37,800
And so using your analogy,
what I'm suggesting is that,

1511
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:43,150
um,
if it was the case that alien life was 

1512
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:44,850
not intelligent,
life was not that hard to come by.

1513
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,520
You'd stick your head out of the 10 and 
you look like Tokyo.

1514
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:51,660
I've often looking like the woods.
Why does it have to look like Tokyo?

1515
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:56,190
Why can't it look like Kansas?
Why can't I be like really spread out?

1516
01:13:56,191 --> 01:14:00,120
And very little life because I think if 
life is splitting out,

1517
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,160
then it's just going to want to,
what does life do?

1518
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:05,180
It just phase to harness resources in 
place to color more of itself.

1519
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:10,450
And maybe it reaches a point where it 
realizes that's few tile just 

1520
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:11,290
concentrates on effective altruism at 
home.

1521
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,230
Oh battlestar.

1522
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,640
So that's the turning inward suggestion 
again.

1523
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:17,850
And so maybe it's the case that like,
yeah,

1524
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:23,210
like is it more important to get your 
shit together at home or to go all over 

1525
01:14:23,311 --> 01:14:26,790
the world with the same bullshit ideas,
right?

1526
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:31,791
I mean that's the case would not be the 
same thing that you could turn towards 

1527
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:36,530
interstellar travel.
Like wouldn't it be more important for 

1528
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:39,810
these communities to concentrate on 
taking care of their planet and figuring

1529
01:14:39,811 --> 01:14:44,811
out a way to work in some sort of a 
harmonious fashion with the very nature 

1530
01:14:45,061 --> 01:14:47,970
of the planet itself rather than travel 
to the star.

1531
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,990
I mean possibly,
but now imagine this.

1532
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,560
So on this alien alien planet,
there's 10 billion aliens and they're 

1533
01:14:56,021 --> 01:15:01,021
like,
let's say that a thousand years more 

1534
01:15:01,021 --> 01:15:01,440
advanced than humans at the moment.
Uh,

1535
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:06,570
in order for this argument to work,
it'd have to be the case that every 

1536
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:09,151
single one of them makes that decision 
to just turn inwards and focus on why 

1537
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:09,210
was that

1538
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:12,090
the case because not all those people 
would be the ones that would innovate in

1539
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:17,091
the first place.
It wouldn't have to be everyone that 

1540
01:15:17,091 --> 01:15:19,131
makes a decision,
but have to be everyone have a high 

1541
01:15:19,131 --> 01:15:21,141
enough consciousness to figure out how 
to make these interstellar machines 

1542
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,970
decides not to harness this nuclear 
power and jet off into space.

1543
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:28,170
But I think over time that will just,
that would just be everyone because.

1544
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:29,130
Well,
yeah,

1545
01:15:29,131 --> 01:15:31,560
I mean just technological progress just 
keeps going.

1546
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,920
And eventually like tech.
I mean obviously we're doing this like 

1547
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,660
weird though,
experiment speculating on economics and 

1548
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,640
sociology of um,
hypothetical alien world.

1549
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:42,570
But,
uh,

1550
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:48,150
I mean just at some point as that,
as a civilization progresses,

1551
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,660
then,
um,

1552
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,320
there's gonna be many,
many actors.

1553
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:57,860
I'm with sufficient power.
So it's sort of liability to spend to 

1554
01:15:58,201 --> 01:16:00,810
the stars.
You need to say that every single one of

1555
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:01,980
them decides to turn inwards.

1556
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,690
So it's sort of like,
um,

1557
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:08,690
technology becomes very rare and then 
ultimately over time becomes very common

1558
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,440
like the cell phone cell phone.
Right.

1559
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:15,670
So when cell phone was first invented,
it was extremely rare and very 

1560
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:19,781
expensive.
Now everyone has one and the 

1561
01:16:19,781 --> 01:16:20,000
capabilities of those cell phones have 
greatly,

1562
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:25,030
greatly improved and that this will 
happen with everything including space 

1563
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,030
travel.

1564
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:29,860
Yeah.
But also it doesn't need to be the case 

1565
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:29,870
that gets up to 10 billion people.
Even if it's just like a thousand people

1566
01:16:29,871 --> 01:16:31,250
or something.
Again,

1567
01:16:31,251 --> 01:16:33,520
it would just seem unlikely that,
you know,

1568
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:36,380
in every civilization and every one just
has,

1569
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:37,910
you know,
even just a thousand people,

1570
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:40,670
everyone chooses not a single person 
thinks,

1571
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:45,940
hey,
I would just want that to be more like 

1572
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:45,940
spread out.

1573
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:49,480
Now that obviously is dependent upon 
there being a more advanced civilization

1574
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:52,450
than human beings on the planet earth.
Because if there weren't,

1575
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:57,720
if there were a few years behind us,
like if they're stuck in the 19 fifties 

1576
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,850
or maybe they're stuck in ancient Greece
or you know,

1577
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,810
then then obviously they don't have the 
capabilities yet.

1578
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:05,650
We might be the very most advanced,
we might be the very tip of the spear.

1579
01:17:05,651 --> 01:17:05,830
Right?

1580
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,020
Yeah,
and I just think,

1581
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:12,050
yeah,
because I think it would be unlikely 

1582
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:12,050
that

1583
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:17,150
something more advanced happened just a 
little bit faster than us,

1584
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:20,570
but not say 100 million years ago,
which is not very long ago.

1585
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,430
Right.
In cosmic terms,

1586
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:27,550
but it's still possible.
I mean it's still possible that 

1587
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:29,240
something happened a hundred years 
quicker than us or that they haven't had

1588
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:34,241
the same setbacks that we've had in 
terms of asteroidal impacts and natural 

1589
01:17:34,241 --> 01:17:36,620
catastrophe supervolcanoes and the link.
Yeah,

1590
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:41,950
it's a,
it's a real weird thought experiment 

1591
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:42,410
because you start thinking,
you start extrapolating,

1592
01:17:42,411 --> 01:17:43,790
okay,
well where are we going to be?

1593
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,170
You know,
where are we going to be in,

1594
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:50,171
why would we do that?
Like that's one of the things that 

1595
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:50,450
always gets me about this whole trip to 
Mars and I had a joke about it in my,

1596
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:55,540
of my last comedy special where people,
where somebody actually said this to me 

1597
01:17:55,540 --> 01:18:00,250
because it was before California.
It's solved it's drought or Mother 

1598
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:00,250
Nature solved our drought for us rather.

1599
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:00,890
Or people like,
hey man,

1600
01:18:00,891 --> 01:18:04,940
we should really consider going to Mars 
because mean look at our environment and

1601
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:07,240
California is almost out of water.
And my joke was like,

1602
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,220
we're right next to the fucking ocean.
Like there's so much water.

1603
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:12,800
You can see the end of it.
We have a salt problem.

1604
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:15,040
We don't have a water problem.
Like what are you going to do?

1605
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:20,041
You going to bring water to Mars?
Like that's the stupidest thing I've 

1606
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:20,041
ever heard in my life.
Yeah.

1607
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:20,041
This,
this weird.

1608
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:23,060
When people start talking about.
I mean I think so there's the,

1609
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,990
it's going to Mas St Newton laws saying 
in McCone right now,

1610
01:18:26,991 --> 01:18:28,940
like the aim of doing that because it's 
awesome.

1611
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,820
Totally on board with that the same way 
as like going to the moon.

1612
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:36,821
It's like look what we can achieve.
This is an exciting like global human 

1613
01:18:36,821 --> 01:18:37,070
fluidic totally just the space shuttle 
going into orbit.

1614
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:38,120
It's pretty bad ass,
right?

1615
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:38,810
Yeah,
exactly.

1616
01:18:38,811 --> 01:18:40,820
Exactly.
But then this talk of like,

1617
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:44,060
oh well we need this and what's to be 
able to survive as a species.

1618
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,200
I'm like,
look,

1619
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:50,201
if you want to have this kind of refuge 
or colony in order to make the math more

1620
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:53,570
robust,
Mazda is just not a great place to pick.

1621
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:56,730
There's so many different ways that,
um,

1622
01:18:57,050 --> 01:19:02,050
I mean Mazda's like wally and 
inhospitable and if you wanted to build 

1623
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:02,330
a refuge,
why not go into the sea?

1624
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:07,780
Um,
that's like a going to be protected 

1625
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:07,780
from,
um,

1626
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:10,160
you know,
Viola says or asteroid impacts.

1627
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:15,161
And so really though,
if one of those big things that slammed 

1628
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:15,920
into the Yucatan slams into where your 
villages and the sea,

1629
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:16,690
I mean,
if you,

1630
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:17,720
if you had,
um,

1631
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:21,350
this underwater village with 10 years of
food supplies and so on,

1632
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,190
then you could like come back because 
the impact from the asteroid wasn't just

1633
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:27,950
like shook everyone office that the sky 
is falling,

1634
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:32,930
the sky is get clouded over with earth 
rang for a million years.

1635
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:35,510
Oh,
what is that as nla impact.

1636
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,270
Yeah.
That's so interesting.

1637
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:43,360
That's so insane.
When you think about how big that thing 

1638
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,301
was that killed the dinosaurs 65 million
years ago and that there's hundreds of 

1639
01:19:46,301 --> 01:19:47,300
thousands of those things floating 
around in space.

1640
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,270
So yeah,
I was asking some people at Nasa just,

1641
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:51,720
um,
uh,

1642
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:56,950
just two days ago actually on how many 
of them we've managed to identify 

1643
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:59,870
because their cvs about kind of scanning
the skies to find them all.

1644
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,810
Um,
and the answer,

1645
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,840
I thought we had it covered.
I thought this was something that Nasa 

1646
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:07,840
was like,
yeah,

1647
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,170
yeah,
we know with all the like.

1648
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,740
And they have response was like,
no,

1649
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:12,290
we've got no idea.
We just,

1650
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:17,430
we don't know how many of them then.
And so we don't know how many we've 

1651
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,430
managed to track.

1652
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:22,310
There's a guy named Randall Carlson and 
I found on podcast a few times and he's 

1653
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:25,821
obsessed with the idea that asteroidal 
impacts were probably would have ended 

1654
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:26,830
the ice age,
you know,

1655
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,440
10 to 12,000
years ago.

1656
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:30,060
And,
and he,

1657
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,820
there's a significant amount of physical
evidence that points to this,

1658
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,740
um,
both in,

1659
01:20:34,741 --> 01:20:37,770
um,
evidence of impact and nuclear glass.

1660
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:41,250
Try think it's called tribe tonight.
I forget the exact word,

1661
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:46,640
but it,
it appears all throughout Europe and 

1662
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,250
Asia and around that same timeline,
around 10,000

1663
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:52,280
and 12,000
years ago when they do core samples and 

1664
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,210
it points to this idea that there were 
significant impacts from asteroidal 

1665
01:20:57,391 --> 01:21:01,470
objects all over Europe and all over 
Asia around that time.

1666
01:21:01,471 --> 01:21:05,610
And they think some of them slammed into
the ice caps that were,

1667
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:10,611
you know,
North America was covered in a giant 

1668
01:21:10,611 --> 01:21:12,180
chunk of it was covered in as much as 
two miles high of ice just 10,000

1669
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:12,660
years ago.

1670
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:18,080
And he points to an incredible amount of
physical change in the environment that 

1671
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:21,060
looks like it took place over a very 
short period of time.

1672
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:26,390
Like catastrophic change over incredibly
short amount of time that he believes 

1673
01:21:26,431 --> 01:21:30,480
points to these impacts.
Melting the ice caps,

1674
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,630
creating massive amount of flooding,
killing off.

1675
01:21:33,631 --> 01:21:38,631
Who knows how many people resetting 
civilization in many different parts of 

1676
01:21:38,631 --> 01:21:41,040
the world.
And this evidence of these,

1677
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:46,041
uh,
of the nuclear glass of these micro 

1678
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:49,011
diamonds that also exist.
They find them during a nuclear test 

1679
01:21:49,011 --> 01:21:53,181
sites when they blow off bombs and they 
also find them at asteroidal impacts 

1680
01:21:53,181 --> 01:21:54,660
sites and you know,
when,

1681
01:21:54,661 --> 01:21:59,661
you know that we have been hit many 
times in the past and they do have 

1682
01:21:59,661 --> 01:22:03,231
evidence of that and then you see the 
moon and all the different impact 

1683
01:22:03,231 --> 01:22:06,291
craters on the moon.
He know that this is just what he calls 

1684
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:06,930
a cosmic shooting gallery essentially.
He's like,

1685
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:11,070
it's very likely that that was the cause
of the end of the ice age.

1686
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,400
There's a lot of,
there's climate data that sort of seems 

1687
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:16,400
to point to that as well.

1688
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:16,590
Okay.
So this,

1689
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:20,160
so this is now like really outside my 
area of expertise

1690
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,540
and you some links to some of his stuff 
because he's been obsessed with this for

1691
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:26,120
about 30 years because fascinating guy.

1692
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:28,360
The two things that would really 
surprise me about that.

1693
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:33,600
Firstly,
just that there were so many ice ages 

1694
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,900
and it was just seemed to be this.
It comes on and goes off for sure.

1695
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,470
Yeah.
Um,

1696
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,920
you know,
fairly dynamic,

1697
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:41,170
predictable process where there's 
asteroid impact.

1698
01:22:41,171 --> 01:22:43,900
Super Random.
So you wouldn't expect to have this kind

1699
01:22:43,901 --> 01:22:46,930
of back and forth then I make,
if it was asteroids that was doing it.

1700
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:52,530
And then secondly,
my understanding would be the asteroids 

1701
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:52,530
would cool the planet because asteroid 
hits,

1702
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:57,100
ash just spreads out all over the sky 
that just blocks out sunlight.

1703
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:00,790
So it would surprise me if it had this 
kind of warming effect.

1704
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:04,390
Well,
I think the idea is that first of all,

1705
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:09,630
when it it,
the impact is massive and it melts off 

1706
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:13,090
just to the huge chunk of the amount of 
water that is a covering North America.

1707
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,370
Right?
And that's one of the things that causes

1708
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:20,371
this massive flooding and this massive 
changing of the topography and as far as

1709
01:23:20,451 --> 01:23:25,451
like what causes the net,
I don't know if it interrupts it 

1710
01:23:25,451 --> 01:23:27,070
temporarily and then it comes back and 
gets warmer.

1711
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:27,650
But the,
uh,

1712
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:32,670
that natural cycle of warming and 
cooling has been going on since they 

1713
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,270
mean from as far back as they can 
measure it.

1714
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,840
What he's talking about.
His significant quick changes.

1715
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:43,050
Also,
the extinction event that killed 

1716
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:45,421
somewhere around 65 percent or more of 
all of the large mammals in North 

1717
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,550
America,
really quickly,

1718
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:51,180
like bully mammoths really quickly.
Saber Tooth Tigers,

1719
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,140
they don't know about that.
That's,

1720
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:58,320
there's a lot of speculation back and 
forth about that because they would 

1721
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,601
think that humans did it.
But then they found these mass dead 

1722
01:24:01,601 --> 01:24:02,470
sites where they're not consumed.
And uh,

1723
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,560
this was the ones that he showed where 
these woolly mammoths,

1724
01:24:05,561 --> 01:24:10,540
they found them where they had their 
legs were broken and it looked like they

1725
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,390
just,
the impact of something had knocked them

1726
01:24:13,391 --> 01:24:17,040
flat and they'd found like thousands of 
them and these mass death side sites.

1727
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,030
But I thought that the,
um,

1728
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:22,110
so firstly it just seemed to me like the
homo,

1729
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,290
the idea that humans killing them all 
just seems like crazy.

1730
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,420
Oh No,
I thought it just seems like such a good

1731
01:24:27,421 --> 01:24:28,530
explanation.
They didn't even have.

1732
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:30,750
They had atlatl so,
but then I was like,

1733
01:24:30,751 --> 01:24:33,510
the best weapon they have at the time.
They weren't even riding on horseback at

1734
01:24:33,511 --> 01:24:38,511
the time.
But then with respect to the death 

1735
01:24:38,511 --> 01:24:40,191
sites,
I thought the mechanism for killing a 

1736
01:24:40,191 --> 01:24:41,901
woolly mammoth,
you just got like 200 humans and you 

1737
01:24:41,901 --> 01:24:41,901
just chase the William mammoth,
a cliff.

1738
01:24:41,901 --> 01:24:43,410
So that does work if you can get them 
near a cliff.

1739
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:48,710
But the idea of getting them all near 
cliffs and killing them all off by a 

1740
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:50,760
bunch of people that hadn't figured out 
the wheel seems a little unlikely.

1741
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:55,530
It's possible like over thousands of 
years because that's the thing.

1742
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:58,620
Like we often tell these stories about,
um,

1743
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,330
you know,
these civilizations,

1744
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,020
humans,
it's like,

1745
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:02,230
oh,
and then they might relate to me,

1746
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:07,340
this journey to your left and so on.
And often that's like they moved a mile 

1747
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,410
of the uh,
so it's like fate journeys actually just

1748
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:15,630
this very gradual.
And certainly if you've got this grave 

1749
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:18,861
site and it's got well,
hundreds of woolly mammoths in this one 

1750
01:25:18,861 --> 01:25:18,861
place,
that might be over thousands of years.

1751
01:25:18,861 --> 01:25:19,230
I mean,
again,

1752
01:25:19,231 --> 01:25:20,880
this is just something I know that's the
thing.

1753
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:22,830
They're talking about carbon dating,
that they're all,

1754
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:27,831
it's all within the same time period.
You'd have to really go over his stuff 

1755
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:29,460
with a fine tooth comb and talked to him
about it because I'm not the right guy.

1756
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,480
I just,
I just listened to them and go woo,

1757
01:25:31,481 --> 01:25:33,750
and then try to relate it as much as 
possible.

1758
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:39,110
There's a podcast that I actually read 
tweeted today because somebody brought 

1759
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:39,420
it up on Youtube.

1760
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:40,290
It's available,
so I'll,

1761
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,880
I'll send you to it afterwards and see 
if you.

1762
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,300
What do you think about it?
But.

1763
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,630
But this is something.
Yeah,

1764
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:46,920
but if you know the book Sapiens,
one of them,

1765
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,110
you're like the fifth person to talk 
about it.

1766
01:25:49,111 --> 01:25:54,111
I've got to get everyone talks about 
savings savings is the book that 

1767
01:25:54,111 --> 01:25:56,640
wouldn't just pull it up a little closer
to you because it makes a big difference

1768
01:25:56,641 --> 01:25:58,590
in the sound,
but yeah,

1769
01:25:58,591 --> 01:26:00,750
one of the things that most blew my mind
there was,

1770
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:05,810
yeah,
how much megafauna there was in the 

1771
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:08,030
early days of homosapiens moving across 
North America.

1772
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:13,031
There were two ton sloths,
giant sloths and one of just vanity 

1773
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:18,501
vanity.
Many massive mega fauna that we just 

1774
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:18,501
don't have anymore.
Yeah.

1775
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:21,770
The blitzkrieg hypothesis is what they 
call the human animal,

1776
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:26,771
killing off all the other animals.
It's a really troubling hypothesis 

1777
01:26:27,351 --> 01:26:29,750
because we don't want to think that 
we're capable of doing that,

1778
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:30,980
but obviously we do do that.

1779
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:32,030
I mean,
we're doing it right now.

1780
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:36,080
We did it to the buffalo and then we 
almost went to the Bison Dodo.

1781
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:41,470
We're doing it just a Tasmanian tiger.
There's a lot of different animals that 

1782
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:42,170
within our lifetime have gone extinct.
I mean,

1783
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:44,300
where it actually like in terms of 
extinctions,

1784
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:46,470
um,
I'm not sure if we'll get the number,

1785
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:51,750
but um,
it would be pretty accurate to describe 

1786
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,600
this as the fourth and make show mass 
extinction because it's just huge.

1787
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:58,370
The number of species have gone extinct.
So this human activity and it's also one

1788
01:26:58,371 --> 01:27:03,371
of those things where we don't think of 
it as being significant because it 

1789
01:27:03,371 --> 01:27:04,250
happens slowly over the course of many 
years.

1790
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,410
But if you look at it on a timeline,
you're like,

1791
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:06,980
oh my God,
look,

1792
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:08,390
everything's dying right now.
Yeah,

1793
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:09,020
yeah,
exactly.

1794
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:13,010
So it's slow by human standards fairly 
quick by nature,

1795
01:27:13,011 --> 01:27:13,980
logical standards.

1796
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:19,900
It's a fascinating subject.
The end of the ice age happening so 

1797
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:23,411
quickly,
the animals dying off so quickly and so 

1798
01:27:23,411 --> 01:27:27,071
many large mammals dying off so quickly.
So when you think about what we know 

1799
01:27:27,071 --> 01:27:31,661
people have done,
like when we almost killed off the ice 

1800
01:27:31,661 --> 01:27:35,510
and they know why they did that,
we know how they did that and they did 

1801
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:37,340
it with extraordinary weapons and they 
did it with high powered rifles.

1802
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:39,080
They could shoot things from a far 
distance.

1803
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:42,620
They did it by shooting off trains.
I mean they did a lot of crazy shit back

1804
01:27:42,621 --> 01:27:47,621
then.
So we understand mean and there's a lot 

1805
01:27:47,621 --> 01:27:47,621
of physical evidence.
You.

1806
01:27:47,621 --> 01:27:51,950
There's photographs of the actual piles 
of bones and all that crazy shit when 

1807
01:27:52,281 --> 01:27:57,281
you,
when you take away those physical 

1808
01:27:57,281 --> 01:27:58,931
capabilities,
the extraordinary physical capabilities 

1809
01:27:58,931 --> 01:28:01,160
like even riding on horseback.
There's a guy named Dan Flores who's a 

1810
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:05,120
fascinating guys,
a scholar who believes that even without

1811
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:10,510
the Europeans coming over here and 
market hunting and killing off all the 

1812
01:28:10,510 --> 01:28:14,060
bison,
he thinks just the firearm and the horse

1813
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:19,450
with the native Americans,
it's entirely possible that they were 

1814
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:19,730
going to eradicate the bison on their 
own.

1815
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:21,290
I mean,
again,

1816
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:26,291
it just depends about timescales,
so even if you're just killing like 

1817
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:30,131
slightly more of the species,
like killing just enough of the species 

1818
01:28:30,131 --> 01:28:32,140
that they're now below the,
you know,

1819
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:36,980
two children for every two minutes.
Viability stage.

1820
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:37,820
Yeah,
exactly.

1821
01:28:37,821 --> 01:28:42,821
Then just over sufficient time and 
remembering the homo sapiens between the

1822
01:28:42,831 --> 01:28:45,440
hunter gatherer age was 190,000
years.

1823
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:48,710
A very long time spans.
Again,

1824
01:28:48,711 --> 01:28:51,060
very short geologically.
But um,

1825
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,610
yeah,
a very long time span.

1826
01:28:52,611 --> 01:28:53,250
So again,
just a,

1827
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:58,860
you don't have to be killing that many 
woolly mammoth to delight them to 

1828
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,500
extinction over the course of several 
thousand years.

1829
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,560
What are your,
when it comes to like the ethical 

1830
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:06,540
reintroduction of animals that have gone
extinct?

1831
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:09,040
Like there are some people in Russia 
that are constant.

1832
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:13,800
They're currently rather working on some
form of a woolly mammoth.

1833
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:18,801
We're going to take woolly mammoth DNA 
from some of these frozen bodies that 

1834
01:29:19,351 --> 01:29:19,770
they've gotten.

1835
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:24,360
They've gotten some pretty intact woolly
mammoths now and they're going to try to

1836
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:25,920
clone one.
Yeah.

1837
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:29,100
So I don't know the details of how this 
will work.

1838
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,920
I guess they have to just stay to in an 
elephant,

1839
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:33,540
um,
but I mean,

1840
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:34,980
I think it's like scientifically 
interesting.

1841
01:29:34,981 --> 01:29:36,240
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with it,

1842
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:41,390
but what are they trying to make them 
like where you have woolly mammoths 

1843
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:41,880
everywhere.
Yeah.

1844
01:29:41,881 --> 01:29:42,570
I mean,
I think,

1845
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:48,260
um,
I don't think there's any ethical 

1846
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:50,661
imperative to do it.
I think there's not a competitive.

1847
01:29:51,141 --> 01:29:56,141
Not like I would think just if there's 
more wooly mammoths that's the same as 

1848
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:58,960
just being more um,
elephants and it might be a scientific 

1849
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:58,960
interest.
I heard,

1850
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,800
um,
wild with like hypotheses that we heard 

1851
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:03,800
and we're like,
oh,

1852
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,460
that's cool.
That sounds ridiculous.

1853
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,780
Um,
yeah.

1854
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:11,781
I heard the idea was leading,
introducing woolly mammoths to like 

1855
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:11,781
stump down snow in order to prevent.

1856
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:15,030
Yes.
Prevent global warming.

1857
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:17,370
Global warming can slow it down somehow 
or another.

1858
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:22,560
Yeah.
There's definitely things that sort of 

1859
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:22,560
thing that people say over dinner,
but yeah,

1860
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,940
with the idea wasn't just stomped down 
snow but also to eat the foliage.

1861
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:28,050
Okay.
Yeah.

1862
01:30:28,051 --> 01:30:33,051
There was like some exfoliating thing 
that they're doing where they would 

1863
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:38,570
consume so many trees and so many plants
that it would actually lower the 

1864
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:39,240
temperature of the earth.
What in the fuck?

1865
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:42,570
Yeah.
Just seems skeptical of that.

1866
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:47,571
But I mean,
there is this philosophical question of 

1867
01:30:47,571 --> 01:30:49,560
whether you should.
So the question of biodiversity loss,

1868
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,750
um,
which has been huge.

1869
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:53,370
Um,
how do you value that?

1870
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:56,400
So is it the case that loss of a 
species,

1871
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:01,700
um,
you can just cash that out in terms of 

1872
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:05,340
impacts on individuals because obviously
it's bad for the animals that die in the

1873
01:31:05,341 --> 01:31:10,341
course of that and it's,
we maybe have a loss of kind of 

1874
01:31:10,341 --> 01:31:10,770
information that we can just not get 
back.

1875
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:17,540
But is there something intrinsically bad
about just having fewer species and a 

1876
01:31:18,361 --> 01:31:23,361
lot of people seem to act to act in a 
way that suggests they seem to believe?

1877
01:31:23,821 --> 01:31:25,530
Yes.
Um,

1878
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:31,010
but it's hard.
I think it's hard philosophically to 

1879
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:31,010
cash that out.
Um,

1880
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:35,451
I think it's hard to explain like why 
would we care so much about losing 

1881
01:31:35,451 --> 01:31:37,800
species where we don't seem to care 
about having,

1882
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,350
you know,
deliberately randomizing.

1883
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:43,620
I'm bleeding and so on that we get more 
species.

1884
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:49,050
Um,
it seems like we're only just 

1885
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:50,691
conservative about not losing them,
but if it really is a value to have 

1886
01:31:50,691 --> 01:31:53,030
greater diversity of species,
why do we not actively find,

1887
01:31:53,031 --> 01:31:58,031
promote greater amount of bio diversity 
of other merely preventing loss of 

1888
01:31:58,031 --> 01:31:59,130
biodiversity.
The,

1889
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:00,580
I think the reintroduction,

1890
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:05,610
the reintroduction of species.
It also like if you have an environment 

1891
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:10,051
that's stable,
have you have some sort of an ecosystem 

1892
01:32:10,051 --> 01:32:13,141
that's stable and then you reintroduce a
Predator or prey or some animal that's 

1893
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:15,690
gonna eat up all the foliage.
It's you,

1894
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:20,740
you're running this big risk and you're 
taking these big chances that you can 

1895
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:23,620
sort of predict the future.
You could look at a plus b equals c,

1896
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:27,700
but it doesn't always work that way and 
there has been disastrous result results

1897
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,750
when they've introduced species,
um,

1898
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:33,340
to other environments where they're not 
native.

1899
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:34,140
Like,
you know,

1900
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:36,040
what's going on with places like 
Australia.

1901
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,110
Australia is kind of hilarious in that 
regard.

1902
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:39,530
Yeah.
So they introduced the lab.

1903
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:42,990
No,
the institute a type of flog to a slave.

1904
01:32:42,991 --> 01:32:47,991
I'm going to butcher this as well,
but the entities type of flag to 

1905
01:32:47,991 --> 01:32:47,991
Australia,
it took over,

1906
01:32:47,991 --> 01:32:51,970
so they introduced a lab at suitland,
eat these blogs or something to eat the 

1907
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:54,490
bugs and then they took over and didn't 
kill the bugs and I think they

1908
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:59,710
more than boxes to try to kill the 
rabbits and they killed all the ground 

1909
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:03,521
nesting birds and they introduce cats to
kill the foxes and I mean you have to 

1910
01:33:03,521 --> 01:33:08,410
kill the rabbits.
That's fact back ward attending 

1911
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:08,410
introduced species,
especially back then,

1912
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,790
you know when they were doing this in 
the 18 hundreds in Australia,

1913
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:12,430
they really didn't know what the fuck 
they were doing.

1914
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:16,010
They're thinking short term right in 
front of them and they also brought in a

1915
01:33:16,011 --> 01:33:18,050
bunch of animals that don't have natural
predators,

1916
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:20,330
so they have to gun them down from the 
fucking sky.

1917
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:25,690
I mean they have these,
all these deer and stags and all these 

1918
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:27,110
magic beasts.
I mean if you ever seen a stag,

1919
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:28,760
they're incredible.
They roar.

1920
01:33:28,761 --> 01:33:33,761
They sound like a lion and they have so 
many of them in Australia and 

1921
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:36,881
particularly in New Zealand,
but they don't have any natural 

1922
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:36,881
predators.

1923
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:36,881
Zero,
no predators,

1924
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:39,200
so they have to fly over and helicopters
and gunned them down.

1925
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:41,050
It's just like.
And they leave them.

1926
01:33:41,051 --> 01:33:43,580
They just leave them to rot.
They just have too many of them.

1927
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:46,000
Same with Kangaroos as well.
Yeah.

1928
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:51,220
Yeah,
because I've seen those herds of 

1929
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:51,220
Kangaroos.
He ever seen that?

1930
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:51,220
No,
I haven't.

1931
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,550
Oh my God,
there's a video that some guy took 

1932
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:58,480
somewhere in Australia and it is 
thousands and thousands of kangaroos 

1933
01:33:59,751 --> 01:34:01,660
running across this field and it looks 
like a,

1934
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:06,580
like some apocalypse apocalyptic 
kangaroo invasion.

1935
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:11,860
See if you can find that Jamie the video
just because it's worth seeing two to 

1936
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:11,860
realize like,
oh,

1937
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:14,750
this is what can happen when there's no 
predators.

1938
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:17,270
Like animals just get completely out of 
control.

1939
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:22,310
Yeah,
so I'm vegetarian and have been for a 

1940
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:24,771
long time now,
but with some other vegetarian fence we 

1941
01:34:24,771 --> 01:34:29,001
had the conversation of yeah,
what would be the most ethical meat to 

1942
01:34:29,001 --> 01:34:31,881
eat and I think we can concluded that 
kangaroo would be the most ethical 

1943
01:34:31,881 --> 01:34:34,620
because it's being killed anyway because
they just need to,

1944
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,930
like,
you've got this population explosion.

1945
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:40,060
It's on land that wouldn't be otherwise 
used for anything,

1946
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,250
you know,
haven't been fully.

1947
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,710
They've got good lives.
Um,

1948
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:47,230
the environmental impact is therefore 
going to be um,

1949
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:49,350
you know,
low or nonexistent as well.

1950
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,120
Um,
obviously it,

1951
01:34:51,121 --> 01:34:54,330
kangaroo meat is very unusual and almost
all of those,

1952
01:34:54,331 --> 01:34:54,840
the guards,

1953
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:55,940
it's not though.
Yeah,

1954
01:34:55,941 --> 01:34:57,980
I mean it's very nutritious.
Apparently

1955
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:00,890
Kangaroos is actually a type of deer,
believe it or not.

1956
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,190
Yeah.
I don't believe that marsupial which has

1957
01:35:04,191 --> 01:35:05,390
a totally different.
It is,

1958
01:35:05,391 --> 01:35:10,391
but it's related to the deer in some 
strict look at these fuckers just 

1959
01:35:10,391 --> 01:35:14,351
hanging out.
This is not the one I'm talking about 

1960
01:35:14,351 --> 01:35:14,351
though.
There's a bunch of them running across a

1961
01:35:14,351 --> 01:35:18,911
field.
This is just a large population of 

1962
01:35:18,911 --> 01:35:18,911
kangaroo.
Yeah.

1963
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:22,010
Some way in the deer family and some 
strange way.

1964
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:27,130
See if Jamie could find that too.
Do you know that we have wallabies in 

1965
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:27,130
Scotland?
Yeah,

1966
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:27,130
I know.
Yeah.

1967
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:28,190
In an island called inch Konica.
Yeah,

1968
01:35:28,191 --> 01:35:30,410
I've heard of that.
I've visited them a number of times.

1969
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:33,290
And were they introduced to Scotland?
Yeah.

1970
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:37,430
So late the oven Kahuna had that bitch.
Yeah.

1971
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:42,360
Well no need for that.
So she,

1972
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:43,700
I'd actually don't know,
but she owned,

1973
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:46,760
she owned the island.
She owned the zoo on the island,

1974
01:35:46,761 --> 01:35:47,720
like a personal zoo.

1975
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:51,770
Um,
and she,

1976
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:57,570
uh,
died I think there lou the zoo went to 

1977
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,000
back and everyone.
So it just kind of was a while,

1978
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,470
but he's just got out and the wallabies 
took over.

1979
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:05,490
Yeah.
First evidence because people wouldn't 

1980
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:08,510
likely visited this was they would find 
these dead wallaby caucuses on the 

1981
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:10,340
mainland and that was during the winter.
The law,

1982
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:15,760
Scottish for lake would freeze over and 
the wallabies would hop on the ice when 

1983
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:18,500
you get hit by a car,
but then now very tame.

1984
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:23,530
It was a shame because I first found out
about them back when it was still a bit 

1985
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:26,180
of a seek.
That was fascinating and now it's become

1986
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:29,480
a bit of a tourist hotspot.
Wow.

1987
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:35,300
Says that Kangaroos are marsupials and 
more closely related to possums than 

1988
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:35,330
deer.
Oh,

1989
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:36,990
okay.
So they're not related to dear mean.

1990
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,740
Correct.
Yeah.

1991
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:43,600
Someone had told me that there were in 
some way in the deer family or cousins 

1992
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,140
of deer or something like that.
Early explorers said that they were just

1993
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,590
what their descriptions were.
They were like deers without antlers and

1994
01:36:49,591 --> 01:36:50,190
they stood up.
Right.

1995
01:36:50,191 --> 01:36:53,000
Like men,
but a salsa.

1996
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:54,510
I mean,
it's a cure a question.

1997
01:36:54,511 --> 01:36:58,110
So I didn't find like an official 
scientist saying here's deciding on it,

1998
01:36:58,111 --> 01:36:58,530
but uh,

1999
01:36:59,290 --> 01:37:04,290
yeah,
that's what I wish I had this my whole 

2000
01:37:04,290 --> 01:37:06,961
life.
Someone who could just follow me around 

2001
01:37:06,961 --> 01:37:06,961
and correct me if the time I say 
something about this,

2002
01:37:06,961 --> 01:37:11,080
this is an amazing time.
Somebody puts something up on instagram 

2003
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:14,851
today and it was a a quote from the 18 
hundreds about an ancient philosopher or

2004
01:37:16,031 --> 01:37:21,031
an ancient scholar rather would give his
life for the information that's 

2005
01:37:21,031 --> 01:37:22,240
available to the common school boy 
today,

2006
01:37:22,241 --> 01:37:24,340
and this was from a quote from 18,
88.

2007
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:30,040
Wow.
Which is nothing now compared to what we

2008
01:37:30,041 --> 01:37:31,150
can do.
Yeah.

2009
01:37:31,151 --> 01:37:36,151
I think there was another statistic,
and again it's unclear how do you 

2010
01:37:36,151 --> 01:37:37,240
measure this,
but in terms of letting the information,

2011
01:37:37,241 --> 01:37:42,241
at least one newspaper has yet more 
letting the information in it than a 

2012
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:46,900
typical person in the 17 hundreds would 
be exposed to for the entire lifetime.

2013
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:52,200
I wonder what.
What was the natural Predator of 

2014
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,050
Kangaroos?
Because kangaroos are.

2015
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:56,040
They're a native animal to Australia and
if they

2016
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,940
didn't,
do you know,

2017
01:37:56,941 --> 01:38:01,110
there was a giant Predator in New 
Zealand at least at one point in time.

2018
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:04,800
It was called the Haast Eagle and it was
an enormous eagle.

2019
01:38:04,801 --> 01:38:09,801
The biggest eagle.
They think that ever lived and had 

2020
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:11,170
something like a 10 foot wingspan and 
they believe that even hunted people who

2021
01:38:11,171 --> 01:38:14,790
have huge,
huge eagle and it's a part of the.

2022
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:20,420
I guess it's the Mowery,
it's a part of their ancient mythology 

2023
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:21,540
and they found out that it is actually a
real animal.

2024
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:26,541
That was somewhere around the 14 
hundreds was made extinct through 

2025
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:26,940
hunting.

2026
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:32,490
My understanding was in Australia before
humans invaded crocodiles.

2027
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:38,220
My understanding was it was just no 
major predators for um,

2028
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,180
that's the Tasmanian Tiger

2029
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:44,210
thylacine yeah.
They call that thing the Tasmanian Tiger

2030
01:38:44,211 --> 01:38:48,910
that died during human,
like modern Thompson's.

2031
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:53,920
It's a crazy looking picture,
but it's face will get that mouth on 

2032
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:53,920
that thing.
Jesus Christ.

2033
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,340
But that I believe those things

2034
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:58,080
died off in the cities.
I just typed this in here,

2035
01:38:58,081 --> 01:38:59,250
this,
that it's now extinct,

2036
01:38:59,251 --> 01:39:02,700
but the Dingo is probably the more 
Predator they had.

2037
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,860
When did it die?
Thylacine is now extinct.

2038
01:39:05,861 --> 01:39:10,861
However,
humans arrived in Australia at least 

2039
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:10,861
50,000
years ago and introduced the Dingo about

2040
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:11,050
5,000
years ago.

2041
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:17,230
So maybe those things were tank 
Kangaroos were a big part of Kangaroos,

2042
01:39:17,231 --> 01:39:20,760
I guess would probably catching them 
when they're not with.

2043
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:25,770
They're young,
but they carry their young inside their 

2044
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:28,021
body in that pouch,
which makes them different from any 

2045
01:39:28,021 --> 01:39:29,450
other kind of animal that it would be 
prey because they can take care of their

2046
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:30,820
young and bounce away quickly.

2047
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:31,970
Well,
this is why.

2048
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,000
So in terms of large mammals,
humans killed every single type of large

2049
01:39:37,791 --> 01:39:40,070
mammal other than Kangaroos in 
Australia.

2050
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:42,500
I think they were kind of hundreds of 
different types of originally.

2051
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:47,680
Oh,
there's a bunch of different things 

2052
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:47,680
other than Kangaroos.
Yeah.

2053
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:47,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

2054
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,350
Like what again,
I don't know,

2055
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,970
maybe giant Koalas,
let's say.

2056
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,160
Um,
but,

2057
01:39:52,161 --> 01:39:53,090
uh,
yeah.

2058
01:39:53,091 --> 01:39:58,091
And,
and my understanding was the reason for 

2059
01:39:58,091 --> 01:39:58,091
that was because they didn't have 
natural predators.

2060
01:39:58,091 --> 01:40:02,650
Um,
and so they just didn't know what to do 

2061
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:04,160
with people.
So that makes sense to have all of these

2062
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:09,310
defensive mechanisms there and also have
wolves and coyotes and bears and all 

2063
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:11,150
these different things that are chasing 
them down.

2064
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,990
That's interesting that the concept of 
what's the most ethical thing to eat.

2065
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:18,560
I would think you would think it would 
be like mollusks.

2066
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:19,550
Okay.
So that's.

2067
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:24,610
Yeah.
So I do think it's totally fine to eat 

2068
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:25,240
anything.
Well,

2069
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:27,320
what I say is I don't eat anything with 
a plane.

2070
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:32,620
So that means the oysters mussels,
clams they have.

2071
01:40:33,131 --> 01:40:34,160
Okay.
Yeah.

2072
01:40:34,161 --> 01:40:39,161
I'm sorry,
I got convinced I didn't use to be like 

2073
01:40:39,161 --> 01:40:39,161
this.
I got convinced by.

2074
01:40:39,161 --> 01:40:40,880
I'm an advocate for gets called by valve
veganism.

2075
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:42,800
I mean it's not,
doesn't make a big difference.

2076
01:40:42,801 --> 01:40:44,540
I don't really like these things.
Eat them occasionally,

2077
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:46,730
but you don't like,
like muscles.

2078
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:47,870
No.
Really?

2079
01:40:47,871 --> 01:40:48,500
Yeah.
No.

2080
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:53,620
Have you ever had linguine with muscles?
Like at a good Italian restaurant with 

2081
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:53,920
a,
a nice red sauce?

2082
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:54,560
Yeah.
I mean,

2083
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,800
so when they're good,
define and when the bad really bad in 

2084
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,740
that case with everything.
No.

2085
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:04,510
Some things when they're good they can 
grows hamburgers.

2086
01:41:04,511 --> 01:41:04,980
I mean,
you,

2087
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:06,590
you can get down the line,
you know,

2088
01:41:06,591 --> 01:41:08,770
you could rotten food.
No,

2089
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:09,730
but like,
you know,

2090
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:12,100
good pizza is just amazing pizza or 
like,

2091
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,210
um,
like I feel like my,

2092
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:17,260
the fatty best muscles.
I'm like mad towards a really?

2093
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,040
Yeah.
Oh man,

2094
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:19,870
you need to go to a really good Italian 
restaurant.

2095
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:23,620
I ever had linguine with clams,
do like clams.

2096
01:41:23,621 --> 01:41:25,900
So again,
I just feel I feel pain differently.

2097
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:26,520
Bedroom.
Oh,

2098
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:31,540
she's crazy.
You just need to go to a really good 

2099
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:31,540
restaurant.
You guys are eating in England,

2100
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:31,540
man.
That's the problem.

2101
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:33,490
They don't know how to make Italian food
there.

2102
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:35,980
Yeah,
that's the great Indian.

2103
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:37,120
I mean there's a few people right now.

2104
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,250
They're screaming in England,
oh,

2105
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:40,300
I'm a good Italian.
So you son of a bitch.

2106
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:43,990
I'm generalizing and I'm aware I'm an 
ignorant and saying that,

2107
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,420
but I can't defend English.
Cuisine.

2108
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:48,730
Great.
Having been out to New York,

2109
01:41:48,731 --> 01:41:52,550
San Francisco,
London has some amazing restaurants now.

2110
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:53,890
London does.
You know what I mean?

2111
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:58,330
But it was always the generalized 
stereotypical knock.

2112
01:41:58,331 --> 01:42:03,331
Was it?
The Food in England was terrible the 

2113
01:42:03,331 --> 01:42:03,331
first time I went there.
It was pretty bad.

2114
01:42:03,331 --> 01:42:07,740
But yeah,
with respect to what's the most ethical 

2115
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:09,331
meat?
I think it is a really interesting 

2116
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:10,921
question because I think,
you know the debate and vegetarianism 

2117
01:42:10,921 --> 01:42:14,401
and so on.
It's normally face to this either or 

2118
01:42:14,401 --> 01:42:15,370
thing like not doing anything or just go
vegetarian or Vegan.

2119
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,280
Um,
but I was interested in this question of

2120
01:42:18,281 --> 01:42:19,030
just,
yeah,

2121
01:42:19,031 --> 01:42:23,370
well supposedly you only want to go 
halfway or of the different foodstuffs,

2122
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:28,380
like what are the,
what are the ones that are going to do 

2123
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:28,990
the most in terms of animal welfare if 
you cut them out?

2124
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:33,040
Because most people when they go halfway
to being vegetarian,

2125
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:35,530
they might cut red meat,
beef and so on.

2126
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:40,780
And I actually think if you care the 
least about the animal welfare side of 

2127
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:43,651
things,
I think that's just long and I think 

2128
01:42:43,651 --> 01:42:45,180
there's two reasons for that.
One is a one,

2129
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:50,210
it's the respect to the amount of 
suffering that the animal has in the 

2130
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:54,031
course of its life where the way that 
chickens are couldn't lead to the tip.

2131
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:59,250
If you look at just average,
and again we're talking about most 

2132
01:42:59,250 --> 01:42:59,250
Checkins,
the,

2133
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:01,090
you're talking about factory farming,
fish farming conditions,

2134
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:06,091
which is well over 90 percent.
I think 99 percent of chickens they've 

2135
01:43:06,091 --> 01:43:08,320
eaten other than these conditions that 
life's just,

2136
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:10,780
I think they're the worst stuff.
Creatures on the planet basically.

2137
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:16,240
Um,
and cows I think often don't have great 

2138
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,130
lives,
but it's just nothing really compared to

2139
01:43:18,131 --> 01:43:19,480
chickens.
And I think poker is similar,

2140
01:43:19,481 --> 01:43:22,210
like pigs also have really terrible 
lives.

2141
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:24,180
Um,
whereas yeah,

2142
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:26,170
large animals,
cows,

2143
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:30,040
a sheep just in general aren't being 
treated as badly.

2144
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:34,210
And then the second question is,
um,

2145
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:39,370
how many animals are you affecting where
if you,

2146
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:45,130
um,
consumer steak or something that's like 

2147
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:47,880
a thousandth of account when I finished,
whereas you can easily eat kind of half 

2148
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,541
a chicken and that's a factor that 
people normally don't consider those as 

2149
01:43:51,541 --> 01:43:52,130
well.
And obviously maybe you value a cow's

2150
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,200
life later than a chicken's life or 
something.

2151
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:59,230
We do in some strange way the hierarchy 
that you have almost inherently,

2152
01:43:59,301 --> 01:44:01,400
or at least we do in the western world.
Yeah,

2153
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:06,401
I think it was really hard to know,
like this is one of the hottest 

2154
01:44:06,401 --> 01:44:10,390
philosophical question I've thought 
about phages and have essentially given 

2155
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:14,351
up on this.
You've got an unhappy cow day and 

2156
01:44:14,351 --> 01:44:14,450
unhappy chicken tell you which is,
which is where I had to wait.

2157
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:19,480
Those two can't or an unhappy fish.
People have very few feelings about 

2158
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:19,840
fish.
Let me,

2159
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,920
you see a dead fish.
People don't feel the same way.

2160
01:44:21,921 --> 01:44:23,630
They feel if you see a dead lamb.
Yeah.

2161
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:26,210
But in general life become more 
sympathetic.

2162
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:31,240
I think there's a bias where we tend to 
sympathize more with things that look 

2163
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,260
like us.
Fish have these weird kind of look.

2164
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:34,660
They don't take care of the young too.

2165
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:37,160
That's cute.
Yeah.

2166
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:42,520
And so over time I've definitely become 
a lot more sympathetic to taking 

2167
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,270
suffering of chickens and fish fairly 
seriously.

2168
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:45,940
Um,
and I,

2169
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:48,410
I think when you combine these two 
factors of,

2170
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:50,540
um,
again,

2171
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:51,020
yeah,
fish,

2172
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:54,200
I think except that there's less good 
information on them.

2173
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:55,750
But um,
I think this might be in the category,

2174
01:44:55,751 --> 01:44:58,100
but certainly chickens and pigs compared
to beef.

2175
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,830
I actually think if you just want to 
kill,

2176
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:02,360
like take out most of the suffering from
your diet,

2177
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:05,610
removing chickens,
cage,

2178
01:45:05,611 --> 01:45:10,611
then caged eggs.
I think in the US actually that's 

2179
01:45:10,611 --> 01:45:10,670
basically all x,
unless you can show them yourself.

2180
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:13,910
Um,
and pork,

2181
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:15,710
I think you're the moving and maybe 
fish.

2182
01:45:15,711 --> 01:45:20,711
I think you moving most of the suffering
from your diet vastly more than when it 

2183
01:45:20,711 --> 01:45:21,860
comes to before milk.
Yeah.

2184
01:45:21,861 --> 01:45:26,861
Well in terms of the amount of 
individuals that get impacted your 

2185
01:45:26,861 --> 01:45:30,431
writing,
that one cow can feed much more people 

2186
01:45:30,431 --> 01:45:30,431
obviously then one chicken cancer.

2187
01:45:30,431 --> 01:45:31,940
So if you're taking one life and that 
form,

2188
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:34,610
what disturbs me most about factory 
farming?

2189
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:36,620
Well,
for one thing that disturbs me,

2190
01:45:36,621 --> 01:45:41,621
it sort of existed and then I found out 
about it and it was already there and I 

2191
01:45:41,621 --> 01:45:44,000
had been eating it all along and that 
shocked me in that I was sitting.

2192
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:48,560
I remember sitting back,
I'd watched some documentary on it and I

2193
01:45:48,561 --> 01:45:53,561
remember sitting back thinking like,
this happened because we weren't paying 

2194
01:45:53,561 --> 01:45:54,590
attention because I was a grown man.
When I found out about it,

2195
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:59,620
I hadn't been paying attention.
And when you leave people alone and you 

2196
01:45:59,620 --> 01:45:59,930
say,
hey man,

2197
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,120
do you think you can get us some beef?
That guy's like,

2198
01:46:02,121 --> 01:46:02,420
yeah,
yeah,

2199
01:46:02,421 --> 01:46:02,970
yeah,
I got it.

2200
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:05,030
Don't worry about it.
You just stay over there and your city.

2201
01:46:05,310 --> 01:46:07,070
I'll take care of it over here.
Out of sight,

2202
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:12,100
out of mind,
and then when we find out about it and 

2203
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:13,250
then you hear about in America we have 
these things called ag gag laws.

2204
01:46:13,251 --> 01:46:15,890
I'm sure you're aware.
It's unbelievable.

2205
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:19,850
Like no possible justification for this 
terrifying.

2206
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,620
It's just because.
So yeah.

2207
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:24,380
Whets their hiding information.
Hiding information.

2208
01:46:24,381 --> 01:46:29,381
Yeah,
and there was a case where there was an 

2209
01:46:29,381 --> 01:46:33,251
animal welfare activists goes into a 
factory farm is filming instances of 

2210
01:46:33,251 --> 01:46:37,571
animal cruelty for of documentary film 
that gets presented and she got fired 

2211
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:43,850
and had to go to prison for not 
intervening in the animal cruelty.

2212
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,580
That was just happening all the time and
she was,

2213
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:50,010
the person is actually about.
So she got tried for intervening,

2214
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:55,010
not stopping the animal cruelty.
We just haven't to maintain all of the 

2215
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:58,701
time.
I thought she would get tried for 

2216
01:46:58,701 --> 01:46:58,701
violating the AG gag laws.
No.

2217
01:46:58,701 --> 01:47:01,660
Well she was an invasion of privacy on 
the corporation.

2218
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:03,030
The corporate secrets.
Yeah.

2219
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:04,600
I think it was applied to the Ad Guy 
Louis.

2220
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:09,770
Oh.
So they found another way to try to 

2221
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:09,770
discourage that.
Yeah.

2222
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:10,200
So that's so insane.

2223
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:13,180
But the thing you said earlier,
which when you're talking about the ways

2224
01:47:13,181 --> 01:47:16,510
in which humans are broken,
I think if you just look at,

2225
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:21,830
yeah,
suffering the humans of inflicting now 

2226
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:24,460
the thing that's really wanting is how 
mechanized it's become.

2227
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:27,790
So if imagine if.
Yeah,

2228
01:47:27,791 --> 01:47:32,791
there was even,
let's say a chicken just like here in 

2229
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:32,791
front of us.
I ain't just for fun,

2230
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:34,690
just kick it.
Um,

2231
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:38,080
people would be outraged.
People would just think I'm this kind of

2232
01:47:38,081 --> 01:47:43,081
despicable person and that's the natural
reaction because I'm just inflicting 

2233
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:45,160
unnecessarily suffering on this 
creature.

2234
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:50,910
But then you can just modify the 
circumstances such that this natural 

2235
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:55,711
emotional reaction of sympathy just 
fades away where now it's this huge 

2236
01:47:56,351 --> 01:48:01,351
warehouse and it's not just one chicken.
It's hundreds of thousands of chicken 

2237
01:48:01,351 --> 01:48:02,980
and it's all mechanized and it's all 
taken out of sight.

2238
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:05,890
I'm suddenly.
Yeah,

2239
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:07,300
I mean just Stalin said,
yeah,

2240
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:10,070
single death is a tragedy,
a million deaths statistic,

2241
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:15,440
um,
and life lessons for them stolen.

2242
01:48:15,821 --> 01:48:16,510
But,
um,

2243
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,400
uh,
it's an extremely good quote,

2244
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:21,950
but he was telling about humans and you 
know,

2245
01:48:21,951 --> 01:48:25,670
any death of a human will be tragedy and
when,

2246
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,040
when they get to large numbers,
it's sort of,

2247
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:33,660
it's very difficult to calculate because
it's hard for people to understand or 

2248
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:34,400
grasp the concept of a million people 
dying.

2249
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:40,720
What's bizarre about factory farming is 
that it's all kind of done behind these 

2250
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:49,480
warehouse walls.
It's all undercover and it's all 

2251
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:52,880
incredibly common and it's all not 
discussed.

2252
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:57,240
This was happening.
Mike was going to say the wars happening

2253
01:48:57,241 --> 01:49:02,241
and 100,000
people a month are dying or discussing 

2254
01:49:02,241 --> 01:49:02,600
how do we mitigate this?
How do we stop this?

2255
01:49:02,601 --> 01:49:04,220
How do we,
how do we bring peace?

2256
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:09,290
There's so few people wondering how to 
stop chicken suffering.

2257
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:10,460
Yeah,
absolutely.

2258
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:15,461
I mean because we've looked into this 
and one of the reasons it's such a 

2259
01:49:15,461 --> 01:49:18,260
priority area is just the amount of just
philanthropic money going into this when

2260
01:49:18,261 --> 01:49:20,210
it's.
The focus is clearly on factory farming,

2261
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:25,240
not sled dogs and so on.
It's in the low tens of millions of 

2262
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:25,240
dollars

2263
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,900
trying to stop factory farming.
Yeah.

2264
01:49:26,901 --> 01:49:31,901
Or trying to mitigate it,
what is the solution like other than 

2265
01:49:31,901 --> 01:49:31,901
going vegetarian,
vegetarian,

2266
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:36,200
when have we reached this point?
So sort of like unmanageable point where

2267
01:49:36,201 --> 01:49:38,810
the population centers like Los Angeles,
New York,

2268
01:49:38,811 --> 01:49:43,811
whatever,
that don't grow their own food and have 

2269
01:49:43,811 --> 01:49:44,570
gotten so massive that in order to fuel 
these people with food,

2270
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,370
especially with,
with animal protein,

2271
01:49:46,371 --> 01:49:48,280
you almost have,
have these setups.

2272
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:53,640
Yeah,
I mean I think if you've got the 

2273
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:55,660
constraint of animal protein,
I mean,

2274
01:49:55,661 --> 01:50:00,661
I think the answer's probably still no,
but the other thing is you just don't 

2275
01:50:00,661 --> 01:50:02,800
need that constraint of animal protein.
We eat way more meat than we did.

2276
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,270
Um,
you know,

2277
01:50:04,271 --> 01:50:05,890
50 years ago,
100 years ago,

2278
01:50:06,370 --> 01:50:08,800
I'm far more than we need to have a 
healthy diet.

2279
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:10,450
I mean,
I've been vegetarian 11 years.

2280
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,340
Do you eat eggs though?
Free range eggs?

2281
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:12,820
Um,
yeah,

2282
01:50:12,821 --> 01:50:13,680
I do.
Um,

2283
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:18,780
that's for me.
I don't understand when people don't 

2284
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:20,380
like when Peter had that whole campaign 
about eggs or chickens periods,

2285
01:50:20,381 --> 01:50:20,950
I'm like,
look,

2286
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:24,640
I can understand you not wanting to eat 
factory farmed chickens,

2287
01:50:24,641 --> 01:50:28,300
eggs because these animals are tortured 
and they're confined and it's horrific,

2288
01:50:28,301 --> 01:50:32,290
but you can definitely find eggs and I 
have my own chickens.

2289
01:50:32,291 --> 01:50:37,291
I have 22 chickens and they lay eggs and
I eat their eggs all the time and I ate 

2290
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:37,900
five of them this morning.

2291
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:42,900
They're great,
but when you're talking about those 

2292
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:42,900
eggs,
there's.

2293
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,060
There's no suffering.
The eggs come out,

2294
01:50:46,330 --> 01:50:48,150
they don't become a chicken.
You take them.

2295
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:51,400
It's free and those chickens,
by the way,

2296
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:54,460
there are a bunch of little murderers.
They run around my yard.

2297
01:50:54,550 --> 01:50:59,550
I've seen them eat a mouse before.
If they found a bird that was down like 

2298
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:03,631
a,
like a nesting bird that had fallen out 

2299
01:51:03,631 --> 01:51:03,631
of a nest,
they'll fuck that bird up.

2300
01:51:03,631 --> 01:51:06,430
Anything that's on the ground.
The only thing they don't seem to like,

2301
01:51:06,431 --> 01:51:08,890
they don't seem to like slugs.
Okay.

2302
01:51:08,891 --> 01:51:10,110
You've tried to feed them?
No,

2303
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:13,690
they eat them.
We pick up a rock in my garden.

2304
01:51:13,691 --> 01:51:18,691
I'll pick up a rock and they should have
come over and just jack anything that's 

2305
01:51:18,691 --> 01:51:19,030
under the rock.
They figured out that when I lift up the

2306
01:51:19,031 --> 01:51:20,230
Rock,
there's bugs under there,

2307
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:21,970
there a little murderers,
man,

2308
01:51:21,971 --> 01:51:22,750
they're ruthless.

2309
01:51:22,930 --> 01:51:27,930
They don't like slugs.
They try them and then they start 

2310
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:31,590
shaking their head.
They tried to get the slime off their 

2311
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:31,590
beak and it kind of freak out.
Yeah.

2312
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:31,590
So yeah,
I mean,

2313
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:35,761
this,
this big within the animal welfare kind 

2314
01:51:35,761 --> 01:51:38,540
of animal activists,
this is actually quite big divide 

2315
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:38,540
between,
um,

2316
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:42,900
you could call them maybe the 
abolitionists to one side and the 

2317
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:43,870
feminists and the abolitionists.
The view is just,

2318
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:45,310
you know,
animal.

2319
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:47,740
The way we treat animals is like how we 
treated slaves.

2320
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:53,720
This is just,
this is kind of the equivalent of 

2321
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:53,720
slavery.
The amount of time and the only end,

2322
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:58,701
you know,
imagine if we'd been in slave owning 

2323
01:51:58,701 --> 01:51:58,701
Americans had like,
Hey,

2324
01:51:58,701 --> 01:52:00,850
well why don't we just cut down the 
number of slaves?

2325
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:03,890
It's just not doing nothing.
They'll model csns,

2326
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:07,210
um,
the welfare lists in contrast,

2327
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:10,800
a more like,
look almost oldest something.

2328
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,850
If we're going to quantify the soft 
thing of the way humans,

2329
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:16,870
the animals know 99 percent of it comes 
from factory farms.

2330
01:52:16,871 --> 01:52:18,940
If we could eliminate and factory farms,
sure,

2331
01:52:18,941 --> 01:52:23,941
there's still something left.
It's not like even if you could a went 

2332
01:52:23,941 --> 01:52:27,330
on the kind of final stage,
but this is where the vast majority of 

2333
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:28,420
both the animals used under the worst 
conditions are.

2334
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,310
And so the welfare would instead say,
look,

2335
01:52:30,311 --> 01:52:35,311
let's literally just focus all of that 
attention on this and things like 

2336
01:52:35,311 --> 01:52:38,761
theater and eggs or services or um,
for just these are just literally kind 

2337
01:52:38,761 --> 01:52:42,060
of not the main issue.
And um,

2338
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:47,720
you know,
I'm naturally most sympathetic to the 

2339
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:47,720
kind of welfare perspective.

2340
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,640
Um,
but it is interesting of the animal.

2341
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:54,940
I know lots of people who were in the 
welfare this camp and then moved to the 

2342
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:55,850
abolitionists camp on welfare.
The clowns were.

2343
01:52:55,851 --> 01:53:00,851
The kind of Wiley is just that.
If you're just an to get people to do a 

2344
01:53:00,851 --> 01:53:04,061
little,
then you're not actually going to move 

2345
01:53:04,061 --> 01:53:04,700
them at all.
Whereas you need to have this hard moral

2346
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:07,490
line and then people kind of see the 
integrity of that follow up.

2347
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:12,610
Well,
it seems to me that there's a slippery 

2348
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:14,561
slope when agriculture and civilization 
were introduced that someone wasn't 

2349
01:53:14,561 --> 01:53:18,401
going to exploit it to the nth degree 
and finger while it's just got to be a 

2350
01:53:18,401 --> 01:53:18,500
better way to squeeze money out of this 
situation.

2351
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:21,230
And then next thing you know,
you've got these factory pig farms.

2352
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:26,620
Sure.
You've seen those horrific one where 

2353
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:28,520
they fly the drone over the lakes of pig
pis and pig shit.

2354
01:53:28,870 --> 01:53:33,870
Absolutely.
That these animals are living just 

2355
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:35,801
completely confined where they can't 
even turn around and they're just 

2356
01:53:35,801 --> 01:53:38,861
pumping them up with whatever the fuck 
they need to keep them alive until they 

2357
01:53:38,861 --> 01:53:38,861
get to a certain point where they can 
kill them.

2358
01:53:38,861 --> 01:53:39,140
Yeah,

2359
01:53:39,550 --> 01:53:42,190
and it is through people.
So many people would be.

2360
01:53:42,191 --> 01:53:44,140
Absolutely.
If that was lightly and fund,

2361
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,130
it would be second.

2362
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:47,400
Yeah.
Hence the AG gag laws.

2363
01:53:47,730 --> 01:53:52,730
In order to keep that money coming in,
they have to keep people in the dark of 

2364
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:55,761
these situations unless they go online 
and seek it out and watch these videos.

2365
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,130
And those videos are very polarizing too
because,

2366
01:53:59,210 --> 01:54:04,210
you know,
when you come to a lot of these animal 

2367
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:05,661
rights organizations,
a lot of them have roots in the Animal 

2368
01:54:05,661 --> 01:54:09,800
Liberation Organization,
which doesn't even believe that you 

2369
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:11,211
should have pets.
They think that your pets are all 

2370
01:54:11,211 --> 01:54:11,250
prisoners.

2371
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:12,400
Yeah.
It's so interesting.

2372
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:16,000
Going back to Peter Singer were,
you said the animal liberation,

2373
01:54:16,001 --> 01:54:19,930
which was the name of his book,
which was kind of text founding text for

2374
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:25,140
what became the animal rights movement.
And what's interesting is the singer 

2375
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:26,320
doesn't believe in rights.
He's a consequentialist.

2376
01:54:26,321 --> 01:54:27,310
CC,
utilitarian.

2377
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,010
Never used the word once.
So what he,

2378
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:31,890
his approach would just be thinking,
yeah,

2379
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:33,920
what's going to do the most good.
Um,

2380
01:54:34,150 --> 01:54:36,610
and on the pets question,
um,

2381
01:54:37,570 --> 01:54:38,800
no,
don't want to speak for Peter,

2382
01:54:38,801 --> 01:54:40,420
but he's going to think,
well,

2383
01:54:40,421 --> 01:54:43,360
if they have a good life and the world 
teetered just seems fine.

2384
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:44,710
Men,
he'd want to say like,

2385
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:47,650
the focus should be on suffering.
Yeah.

2386
01:54:47,651 --> 01:54:52,651
On the huge,
vast magnitudes of suffering that goes 

2387
01:54:52,651 --> 01:54:52,651
on in factory farms.
That's with one,

2388
01:54:52,651 --> 01:54:52,651
two,
three,

2389
01:54:52,651 --> 01:54:52,690
and four.

2390
01:54:52,950 --> 01:54:55,980
Yeah.
I have a hard time even entertaining the

2391
01:54:55,981 --> 01:55:00,981
conversation that there's something 
wrong with a healthy pet dog like that 

2392
01:55:00,981 --> 01:55:04,551
dog loved the owner.
The people love the dog and the dog has 

2393
01:55:04,551 --> 01:55:07,521
obviously gone through an incredible 
evolutionary process where it's gone 

2394
01:55:07,521 --> 01:55:12,261
from being a wolf to being a Chihuahua.
Like if you think that thing should be 

2395
01:55:12,261 --> 01:55:13,470
out fending for itself and the forest 
boy,

2396
01:55:13,471 --> 01:55:15,300
you're dooming that little fucker to 
death.

2397
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:20,960
Well,
the question that dog in all of these 

2398
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:23,001
cases,
like the animals wouldn't exist 

2399
01:55:23,001 --> 01:55:23,001
otherwise and that wouldn't exist from 
people.

2400
01:55:23,001 --> 01:55:27,231
I mean if it wasn't for people breeding 
them and making them this bulldog like 

2401
01:55:27,231 --> 01:55:31,341
this thing that can't even hardly 
breathe and walks with a wattle like 

2402
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:32,040
we're weird that we've done that in the 
first year place.

2403
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:37,100
Yeah,
I mean I find especially the pets like 

2404
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:37,100
dogs that have.
Yeah,

2405
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:39,000
like difficulty thing,
genetic diseases.

2406
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:42,240
I find it kind of goes like this,
gross that we've kind of done that.

2407
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:43,980
I've gotten one.
What type of

2408
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,710
dog do you have?
A Shibu Ino English bulldog mix.

2409
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:48,360
Some poor little fucker.
He's a mess.

2410
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:50,150
We got him as a puppy,
you know,

2411
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:55,170
because he was cute and he just seemed 
like it needed a home and we took 

2412
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:55,170
Amanda.
God,

2413
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:57,600
he's all messed up man.
I mean I've had them for 10 years.

2414
01:55:57,601 --> 01:56:00,360
He said all these surgeries and can't 
walk right?

2415
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:02,700
His hips are all fucked up.
He's just like,

2416
01:56:02,701 --> 01:56:05,300
they breed them to the point where he's 
half sheebu.

2417
01:56:05,350 --> 01:56:09,300
He knows he's actually better off than a
lot of bulldogs because he's 12 now.

2418
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:11,700
I don't think bulldogs usually live that
long.

2419
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:16,320
I don't think they lived to that age,
but he's got all sorts of difficulties.

2420
01:56:16,330 --> 01:56:18,020
Can't really run.
No,

2421
01:56:18,070 --> 01:56:20,160
he's lazy.
He just likes to lay down snore.

2422
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:23,880
But the poor little things like if you 
look at an actual,

2423
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:26,970
like legit English bulldog with their 
flat faces,

2424
01:56:26,971 --> 01:56:30,890
like they have massive respiratory 
problems and yeah.

2425
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:34,620
So I find that like the fact that we 
like engaged in this paddock,

2426
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:37,050
depleting them kind of weird.
But then like,

2427
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:42,080
yeah,
if you're going to have a dog and look 

2428
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:42,080
after that,
well like it's not the problem.

2429
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:47,000
And so this,
this question is just if you're talking 

2430
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,161
about that,
oh you just like distracting from the 

2431
01:56:49,161 --> 01:56:50,040
main issue which is coming.
So seems to me that,

2432
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:52,410
that this is just like everything else 
in life,

2433
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:57,920
like as you go down the rabbit hole and 
you look at a deeper and deeper and 

2434
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:57,920
deeper,
you go,

2435
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:58,290
God,
this is a complicated issue.

2436
01:56:58,770 --> 01:57:03,770
You know,
how do you get all these people to stop 

2437
01:57:03,770 --> 01:57:04,290
eating so much meat so that you don't 
need so much meat so that you don't need

2438
01:57:04,291 --> 01:57:09,291
factory farming and have to get people 
aware of what is the consequences of 

2439
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:11,880
going and buying a chicken sandwich?

2440
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:16,880
Well,
do you know where that chicken came 

2441
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:16,880
from?
Here?

2442
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:16,880
Check this out.
Are you happy now?

2443
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,710
And a lot of people,
they watched those videos and then 

2444
01:57:20,710 --> 01:57:20,710
they'd go,
ah,

2445
01:57:20,710 --> 01:57:20,710
fuck it,
I'm hungry.

2446
01:57:20,710 --> 01:57:20,820
I want a chicken sandwich.
Yeah,

2447
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:22,650
lots of people do.
I do think though,

2448
01:57:22,651 --> 01:57:26,730
like so in the UK at least if you buy a 
pack of cigarettes,

2449
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:28,920
you get these pictures on them showing 
kind of what this is,

2450
01:57:28,921 --> 01:57:33,921
what the lungs will look like if you 
smoke 20 a day and those warnings and 

2451
01:57:33,921 --> 01:57:33,921
things.
Yeah.

2452
01:57:33,921 --> 01:57:34,050
That doesn't stop people in some weird 
way.

2453
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:39,560
I mean people are addicted to sick of 
that so I think it must have some 

2454
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:39,560
impact,
but I wonder it does.

2455
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:41,310
If you could buy a pack of chicken and 
you'd say,

2456
01:57:41,311 --> 01:57:45,000
well this is,
this is this field of piss and shit.

2457
01:57:45,090 --> 01:57:46,410
That chicken grew up in.

2458
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,170
Right?
Like the opposite of an ag gag law.

2459
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:54,200
Like force it in your face because look,
I mean you're just giving the consumer 

2460
01:57:54,371 --> 01:57:56,000
more information.
Having that.

2461
01:57:56,430 --> 01:58:01,430
Like if you went to the butcher shop,
went to the butcher section in the 

2462
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:05,221
grocery store and there was videos that 
were playing constantly above the 

2463
01:58:05,221 --> 01:58:07,800
package meat that showed these animals 
getting like a piston through the head,

2464
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:11,970
hanging by their ankles and getting bled
out while they kicked.

2465
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:17,870
Oh,
and how many people that would be a 

2466
01:58:17,870 --> 01:58:18,720
fucking conveyor belt of baby mail 
checks falling into this.

2467
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:23,780
I'm getting ground up.
That would be a fascinating 

2468
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:28,401
psychological examination to watch 
people walk up to that butcher shop and 

2469
01:58:28,771 --> 01:58:31,560
see those videos playing.
Like if that became the law.

2470
01:58:31,690 --> 01:58:32,910
Yeah,
I mean there's,

2471
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:37,670
there's an amazing.
It was a comedy sketch show that um,

2472
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:42,040
did something kind of similar,
which was the bill would go up to

2473
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,480
the butcher's counter and say,
okay,

2474
01:58:43,481 --> 01:58:44,920
I'd like some sausages.
They go,

2475
01:58:44,921 --> 01:58:47,670
okay,
pick up a little baby pig at good to,

2476
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:50,260
into this box.
This box is obviously fake.

2477
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:55,470
And just like,
do this action in sausages would come 

2478
01:58:55,470 --> 01:58:57,721
out.
Obviously they're not actually getting 

2479
01:58:57,721 --> 01:58:59,330
it right and people will be out late and
it's like,

2480
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:04,600
no web.
She not know where pork comes down.

2481
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:10,860
So yeah,
that's the thing that's just amazing is 

2482
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:10,860
how people can call themselves an animal
lovers.

2483
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:11,510
Well there's also

2484
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:16,540
people that love animals and eat meat,
like they'll eat steak and then get mad 

2485
01:59:16,641 --> 01:59:18,080
at people for hunting animals.
I've,

2486
01:59:18,250 --> 01:59:20,300
I've experienced that personally.

2487
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:23,860
This is a good case though,
of the salient issue where,

2488
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:26,020
um,
I mean,

2489
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:29,560
so I have like a post hunting and bad 
fandom that gets killed,

2490
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:35,160
but the thing is it's so salient 
compared to factually farming and it's 

2491
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,220
like,
you know what,

2492
01:59:36,221 --> 01:59:38,830
I prefer that people hung meat other 
than like factory farming.

2493
01:59:38,831 --> 01:59:39,500
It's like,
of course,

2494
01:59:39,501 --> 01:59:44,501
and like you do the math,
it's like not only am I behind that and 

2495
01:59:44,501 --> 01:59:44,860
behind that like a thousand times.
Again,

2496
01:59:44,861 --> 01:59:47,470
the hunting is just,
it's this fairly salient thing,

2497
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:48,480
you know,
in the UK,

2498
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:51,280
a huge uproar about fox hunting and so 
on.

2499
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:53,350
But that's a different thing because fox
hunting,

2500
01:59:53,351 --> 01:59:55,450
you're not,
you're not eating it now.

2501
01:59:55,470 --> 01:59:57,040
I mean it's supposed to be for.
Yeah.

2502
01:59:57,041 --> 01:59:58,330
It's Kinda like I'm in control.

2503
01:59:58,410 --> 01:59:59,580
Yeah.
And there's some,

2504
01:59:59,581 --> 02:00:03,270
there's some logic to that that if you 
don't have natural predators,

2505
02:00:03,271 --> 02:00:08,271
you need to figure out some way to 
control certain populations that can be 

2506
02:00:08,271 --> 02:00:10,560
damaging like Fox or in some places 
black bear.

2507
02:00:10,561 --> 02:00:12,990
And there's a bunch of different animals
that you do have to control because they

2508
02:00:12,991 --> 02:00:14,820
don't have,
they don't have a natural predator.

2509
02:00:15,290 --> 02:00:15,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

2510
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:19,320
But the thing that's like incredible for
me,

2511
02:00:19,321 --> 02:00:24,321
it's just how people can have such long 
views on that and such long views on 

2512
02:00:24,321 --> 02:00:26,280
hunting and then just eat me know the 
actions effectively.

2513
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:27,060
Farming.
Yeah.

2514
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:28,500
They just don't see it,
you know,

2515
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:31,080
it is just because we have value 
manipulable.

2516
02:00:31,081 --> 02:00:34,380
Is he in terms of a model,
the action.

2517
02:00:34,530 --> 02:00:37,410
Well there's obviously a wedding because
there's certain that you have.

2518
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:40,970
There are certain animals that you have 
to control the populations of less,

2519
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:45,980
especially invasive species like pigs,
like wild pigs are huge problem in 

2520
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:50,301
America and getting bigger and bigger.
I know you guys don't have them as much 

2521
02:00:50,301 --> 02:00:50,370
in the UK,
but in,

2522
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:55,460
in America,
particularly in Texas and now in 

2523
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:55,830
northern California,
which is a massive,

2524
02:00:55,831 --> 02:01:00,831
massive populations of wild pigs and 
they give birth two to three times a 

2525
02:01:00,831 --> 02:01:04,881
year and they can give birth to as many 
as three to six piglets in each lit and 

2526
02:01:05,401 --> 02:01:10,401
they just caught and then six months 
later those piglets are ready to give 

2527
02:01:10,401 --> 02:01:10,401
birth.
So they just boom,

2528
02:01:10,401 --> 02:01:10,620
boom,
boom,

2529
02:01:10,621 --> 02:01:15,621
boom.
And if you don't control their 

2530
02:01:15,621 --> 02:01:16,941
populations,
what are you gonna do you're gonna like 

2531
02:01:16,941 --> 02:01:16,941
let wolves lose to control their 
populations.

2532
02:01:16,941 --> 02:01:17,670
I mean they have to figure out how to do
it,

2533
02:01:18,210 --> 02:01:23,210
and so they've taken to a lot of the 
same strategies that they're using in 

2534
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:25,230
New Zealand that we talked about,
what stags in Texas,

2535
02:01:25,530 --> 02:01:30,530
they have these helicopter hunts where 
they fly around in helicopters just 

2536
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:33,910
gunned down hundreds and hundreds of 
these pigs and they do wind up donating 

2537
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:38,940
the meat of that pigs to homeless 
shelters and people who need it and it.

2538
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:42,710
It's actually very nutritious and very 
healthy and very good for you and that's

2539
02:01:42,711 --> 02:01:47,711
probably way better than buying pig from
someone who's raised it in some horrific

2540
02:01:48,111 --> 02:01:53,111
factory farming environment.
But for people that just want the 

2541
02:01:53,111 --> 02:01:54,230
animals to live and be unchallenged in 
on,

2542
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:56,330
on preyed upon,
I get it.

2543
02:01:56,690 --> 02:02:01,690
They all seemed very disturbing,
but you got to control the populations 

2544
02:02:01,690 --> 02:02:02,090
because you're not going to have any 
agriculture.

2545
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:07,840
They're going to find out where the 
farms are and they tear them apart at 

2546
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:07,840
night.
They're nocturnal animals.

2547
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:10,610
You can't stop them with fences.
They go right through fences,

2548
02:02:10,611 --> 02:02:11,960
they're huge,
huge animals,

2549
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:15,590
wild pigs create millions of dollars of 
damage in Riverside County.

2550
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:16,510
Wow.
That's.

2551
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:20,480
That's like Riverside county's like 
super populated,

2552
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:22,970
but this is a.
it's an enormous,

2553
02:02:22,971 --> 02:02:25,160
enormous problem in this country and by 
the way,

2554
02:02:25,161 --> 02:02:30,161
when you look at that animal,
what's really cool about pigs is that 

2555
02:02:30,161 --> 02:02:30,161
they morph.

2556
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:35,260
When you see that animal,
it looks very different than a domestic 

2557
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:35,260
pig,
but it's exact same animal.

2558
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:38,140
They're all the same genus,
so called [inaudible],

2559
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:43,750
and when you take a domestic pig and you
let it go within months,

2560
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:47,510
within months of being free,
their hair starts to change.

2561
02:02:47,630 --> 02:02:51,320
Their snouts starts to elongate.
Their tusks start to grow longer.

2562
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:53,360
They,
once they become feral,

2563
02:02:53,361 --> 02:02:55,460
once they realize they have to fend for 
themselves,

2564
02:02:55,640 --> 02:02:59,510
there's an actual physiological change 
in the structure of their body.

2565
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:03,140
So it's fascinating.
So it's really crazy.

2566
02:03:03,141 --> 02:03:08,141
Their hair gets thicker,
they develop a thicker plate the males 

2567
02:03:08,141 --> 02:03:11,951
do around the chest to protect 
themselves from other males when they 

2568
02:03:11,951 --> 02:03:12,620
fight.
It's bizarre.

2569
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:15,860
So those wild pigs that people see,
there's a bunch of different kinds.

2570
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,550
Some of them are Russian boars are wild,
you know,

2571
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:21,200
the different,
different kind of a pig,

2572
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,330
but ultimately they all interbreed with 
each other.

2573
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:29,060
It's just so interesting as well.
Coming back to the question of what's 

2574
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:32,630
natural and so on,
people often think about meat that a 

2575
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:36,101
thing as well where if you look at the 
chickens can barely stand because 

2576
02:03:36,681 --> 02:03:39,260
they've been so engineered,
huge blasts,

2577
02:03:39,310 --> 02:03:41,780
you know,
pigs that you're talking about like,

2578
02:03:41,890 --> 02:03:44,630
uh,
not meant to be pink to be blown,

2579
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:50,160
you know,
cows just can you really imagine a cow 

2580
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:53,141
like evolving in the wild are like,
of course not all of these things that 

2581
02:03:53,141 --> 02:03:57,250
can edibly unnatural through thousands 
of years of a selective leading.

2582
02:03:57,450 --> 02:04:01,220
Well crap cows don't live in the wild,
but here's where it gets interesting.

2583
02:04:01,221 --> 02:04:03,890
In Australia,
when cows have gotten wild,

2584
02:04:04,190 --> 02:04:09,190
they've gotten loose from these pens 
that people held them in and then they 

2585
02:04:09,190 --> 02:04:13,661
become what they call scrub bowls and 
they're out there in the wild and people

2586
02:04:13,881 --> 02:04:18,881
hunt them like they would hunt a wild 
animal and they're very wary and they 

2587
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:18,881
run from people.

2588
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:23,740
They see people that get the fuck out of
there and the bowls are incredibly 

2589
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:24,140
violent,
like the,

2590
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:29,200
the male cows.
These scrub bowls are some of the most 

2591
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:33,101
dangerous things to hunt in the world 
because they'll actively chase you down 

2592
02:04:33,101 --> 02:04:33,380
like a bull,
like,

2593
02:04:33,381 --> 02:04:38,381
you know,
if you see like people trying to ride 

2594
02:04:38,381 --> 02:04:40,271
bowls and bowls kick and they go crazy.
All these scrub bowls are essentially 

2595
02:04:40,271 --> 02:04:40,920
those bowls,
but many,

2596
02:04:40,921 --> 02:04:42,210
many,
many generations.

2597
02:04:42,211 --> 02:04:44,660
Wild.
So they're feral bowls.

2598
02:04:45,150 --> 02:04:46,310
Answer.
Yeah.

2599
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:51,340
And so they,
they sort of were bred to be this 

2600
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:55,041
domestic thing and then they got loose 
and then they became this wild thing and

2601
02:04:55,231 --> 02:04:57,870
so they look slightly differently.
That's what they look like.

2602
02:04:57,930 --> 02:05:02,930
That's a scrub bull.
So they're becoming slowly over the 

2603
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:06,240
course of many generations are more wild
animal.

2604
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:11,450
So they,
they have these hunts for these 

2605
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:11,450
scribbles and if that thing sees you,
by the way,

2606
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:14,010
that crazy look and bowl,
they will fuck you up.

2607
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:20,050
There are some of the most dangerous 
animals that you can encounter in the 

2608
02:05:20,050 --> 02:05:20,580
wild apparently.
But,

2609
02:05:20,581 --> 02:05:21,420
uh,
I have a buddy,

2610
02:05:21,450 --> 02:05:22,470
my friend Adam.
Yeah.

2611
02:05:22,471 --> 02:05:24,900
They look different.
Like look at the Hump on its back,

2612
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:30,380
I mean that looks like some crazy wild 
African animal and it was originally a 

2613
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:34,551
long time ago of regular domestic cow,
so it shows just how officially they 

2614
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:38,170
are,
if that's just,

2615
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:41,390
if that's the sort of changes you get 
over just the course of a few generation

2616
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:44,970
natural selection as opposed to what 
we're doing with dogs.

2617
02:05:45,090 --> 02:05:47,310
You know when we create a bulldog,
I mean that is,

2618
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:52,580
those are the animals that have survived
and and they've changed their 

2619
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:54,450
coloration.
Their physical structure looks different

2620
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:56,160
in over many,
many generations.

2621
02:05:56,161 --> 02:05:57,720
It's quite,
quite fascinating.

2622
02:05:57,740 --> 02:06:00,450
Yeah.
It's like we have to figure out where we

2623
02:06:00,451 --> 02:06:03,900
stand I think in terms of the entire 
ecosystem,

2624
02:06:04,110 --> 02:06:06,450
because we're certainly not viable.

2625
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:09,180
We can't go out there and live amongst 
those animals.

2626
02:06:09,181 --> 02:06:10,800
I mean we won't,
we'll get killed,

2627
02:06:10,801 --> 02:06:15,801
will get eaten.
We so we have to stay inside of our 

2628
02:06:15,801 --> 02:06:18,921
homes.
We have to stay inside of our 

2629
02:06:18,921 --> 02:06:19,440
environments and then we have to figure 
out like how much of an impact should we

2630
02:06:19,441 --> 02:06:22,980
have on those things around us.
Should we be like all the other animals,

2631
02:06:23,070 --> 02:06:25,620
like all the wolves and all these other 
animals,

2632
02:06:25,621 --> 02:06:30,621
the coyotes that have this impact on the
environment or should we try to lessen 

2633
02:06:30,621 --> 02:06:33,690
our footprint to the point where we have
zero impact on any of the animals and we

2634
02:06:33,691 --> 02:06:36,780
just live inside of these sustained 
areas that grow vegetation.

2635
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:38,190
It's,
um,

2636
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:41,880
it's an interesting question because 
those animals prey on each other.

2637
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:43,120
They all do.
And like,

2638
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:46,020
what should we be a part of that?
Should we take place?

2639
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:47,400
Should we take part in that?

2640
02:06:47,670 --> 02:06:49,410
I definitely don't think we should 
factory farm.

2641
02:06:49,830 --> 02:06:54,570
I definitely think that that was a huge 
mistake and I also definitely think that

2642
02:06:54,571 --> 02:06:58,290
that huge mistake is what led us to be 
able to have these gigantic cities and I

2643
02:06:58,291 --> 02:07:00,780
don't think necessarily cities are a 
huge mistake,

2644
02:07:01,110 --> 02:07:06,110
but man,
trying to figure out how to feed those 

2645
02:07:06,110 --> 02:07:06,570
people in the way that they're 
accustomed to eating right now.

2646
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:08,350
There's a,
that's a massive,

2647
02:07:08,770 --> 02:07:10,190
massive battle.
Yeah.

2648
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:15,200
But I think the kind of question of 
large populations and how do you feed 

2649
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:19,341
them,
that massively tells in favor of flow 

2650
02:07:19,341 --> 02:07:20,390
and meat consumption or vegetation or 
because you've got this 10 to one little

2651
02:07:20,410 --> 02:07:24,150
way to create a category of meat.
You need 10 calories or more of,

2652
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:29,640
um,
of they ignore soliah wherever you're 

2653
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:33,171
feeding them,
unless you're dealing with people just 

2654
02:07:33,171 --> 02:07:33,171
consuming wild pigs.
Yeah.

2655
02:07:33,171 --> 02:07:33,171
Wild pigs.
Oh,

2656
02:07:33,171 --> 02:07:36,160
Kangaroos or something with no 
exceptions to that as well.

2657
02:07:36,161 --> 02:07:41,161
But,
but I think there's enough to feed 

2658
02:07:41,161 --> 02:07:41,161
people though.
That's the other thing.

2659
02:07:41,161 --> 02:07:41,560
There's 350 million people in this 
country.

2660
02:07:41,561 --> 02:07:43,700
There's not $350 million wild pigs.
Yeah,

2661
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,140
exactly.

2662
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,660
Um,
but it means that in the future,

2663
02:07:46,661 --> 02:07:50,860
just as populations get larger than.
Yeah.

2664
02:07:50,861 --> 02:07:52,510
Again,
we're just going to need to use,

2665
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:55,600
um,
landon energy more efficiently.

2666
02:07:55,601 --> 02:08:00,601
So this is yet another argument in favor
of a plant based diet.

2667
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:02,200
Yeah.
Well,

2668
02:08:02,201 --> 02:08:04,870
in America at least,
the majority,

2669
02:08:04,871 --> 02:08:08,410
the vast majority of the money that goes
towards conservation,

2670
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:11,890
towards keeping wild animal populations 
high is actually from hunting.

2671
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:17,670
It's a real strange contradiction that 
makes people really uncomfortable once 

2672
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:21,091
they find it out,
is that the vast majority of the money 

2673
02:08:21,091 --> 02:08:23,770
that goes to present protect habitat to 
preserve wild lands.

2674
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:26,140
It comes from hunting.
In fact,

2675
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:30,130
hunters voluntarily agreed,
I believe it was in the 19 thirties,

2676
02:08:30,131 --> 02:08:35,131
to give up 10 percent.
I want to make sure that number's right 

2677
02:08:35,131 --> 02:08:39,571
too,
but have the the money in terms of the 

2678
02:08:39,571 --> 02:08:43,141
percentage of sales of hunting equipment
goes directly towards conservation.

2679
02:08:43,241 --> 02:08:44,710
There's all these things.
Yeah,

2680
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:49,920
there's all these different entities 
like the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation 

2681
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,040
that have repopulated elk into all these
areas,

2682
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:56,050
but done so specifically so that people 
can hunt them so it gets really weird,

2683
02:08:56,720 --> 02:09:00,820
like it might be an uneasy alliance 
between in many people's eyes,

2684
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:02,650
but they're the ones that are giving up 
the money.

2685
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:05,440
The money is not coming from altruistic 
organizations.

2686
02:09:05,441 --> 02:09:10,441
It just want to preserve these animals 
so that they can exist in the free wild 

2687
02:09:10,441 --> 02:09:11,050
way that they did before people got 
here.

2688
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:16,260
But there's more white tail deer in 
America today that when Columbus landed 

2689
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:19,360
so and that's all because of 
conservation,

2690
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:24,420
because of hunting.
So it's another one of those weird 

2691
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:25,120
things where at the whole picture,

2692
02:09:25,330 --> 02:09:30,330
yeah,
there's a solution that's I've heard 

2693
02:09:30,330 --> 02:09:32,161
suggested for reducing species loss,
which is to um,

2694
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:39,430
allow basically ownership of species.
So you can copy the panda.

2695
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:42,610
I'm now,
isn't this a weird idea?

2696
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:45,280
But the idea is that then now suddenly,
like at the moment,

2697
02:09:45,281 --> 02:09:47,770
no one has a financial incentive,
um,

2698
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:52,800
to ensure that pandas don't go extinct.
Whereas if someone were able to say,

2699
02:09:55,001 --> 02:09:55,690
no,
I have,

2700
02:09:55,810 --> 02:09:59,620
if you want to use a panda and video or 
so and you have to pay the owner.

2701
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:04,740
Yeah.
Well I'm very uncomfortable with the 

2702
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:07,180
idea of this laboratory created meet as 
to where that's going to go.

2703
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:10,480
Why are you uncomfortable?
I'm very positive about it.

2704
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:15,481
I mean the science is kind of tricky,
but I'm positive about it and that it's 

2705
02:10:15,481 --> 02:10:19,081
not gonna be any animal suffering.
It's going to be fascinating in that 

2706
02:10:19,081 --> 02:10:22,201
regard.
But what's going to happen if we find 

2707
02:10:22,201 --> 02:10:22,270
out that,
well,

2708
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:23,830
there's a bunch of different things,
right?

2709
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:25,390
First of all,
we have to make sure that it's healthy.

2710
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:30,720
We have to make sure that it doesn't 
cause some sort of a weird disease 

2711
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:33,961
because you're not eating something 
that's living and moving and when you 

2712
02:10:33,961 --> 02:10:36,591
meet sedentary creatures,
maybe there's some sort of an adverse 

2713
02:10:36,591 --> 02:10:39,821
impact on our biology because I think 
there's an adverse impact when you eat 

2714
02:10:39,821 --> 02:10:44,081
protein from an animal that is weak and 
sick and they've actually shown that.

2715
02:10:44,650 --> 02:10:48,290
Um,
there was a study that Dr Rhonda Patrick

2716
02:10:48,291 --> 02:10:53,291
sent me recently that showed that 
animals that eat older sick animals die 

2717
02:10:56,570 --> 02:11:01,570
quicker.
They have a shorter lifespan and in 

2718
02:11:01,570 --> 02:11:04,900
exhibit less health characteristics,
I believe it was than animals that ate 

2719
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:09,791
younger animals and there seems to be 
some sort of a direct correlation 

2720
02:11:09,791 --> 02:11:14,621
between eating younger healthy things 
and having a positive impact on,

2721
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:20,460
on physical life itself,
the animal that's consuming it and that 

2722
02:11:20,460 --> 02:11:22,160
if you're eating something that never 
existed in the first place,

2723
02:11:22,161 --> 02:11:27,161
like what?
Unless they're able to recreate the 

2724
02:11:27,161 --> 02:11:29,270
characteristics of a healthy animal,
like a strong muscle tissue.

2725
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:31,640
Like maybe they could do that with 
electrical impulses,

2726
02:11:31,641 --> 02:11:34,790
like some sort of electrical muscles.
Muscular stimulation.

2727
02:11:35,170 --> 02:11:36,610
Yeah.
I don't see why that would be a problem.

2728
02:11:36,611 --> 02:11:41,611
I mean,
at least you'd think you'd be able to 

2729
02:11:41,611 --> 02:11:41,611
get past that in fact,
where,

2730
02:11:41,611 --> 02:11:46,050
you know,
the meat that we've currently got 

2731
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:46,050
stuffed full of antibiotics,
um,

2732
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:49,690
you know,
there's a often viruses that or

2733
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:52,920
why this is the kind of aligned swine 
flu,

2734
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:54,170
flu,
flu.

2735
02:11:54,171 --> 02:11:59,171
Exactly.
You could avoid all of them with all 

2736
02:11:59,171 --> 02:12:01,571
that.
All that stuff comes from factory farm 

2737
02:12:01,571 --> 02:12:01,571
and in fact.

2738
02:12:01,571 --> 02:12:03,920
Yeah.
And in fact then once you start to 

2739
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:05,631
engineer meet,
perhaps you could engineer exactly the 

2740
02:12:05,631 --> 02:12:09,381
healthiest sort of meat you've got so 
much more control over the product.

2741
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:11,340
There'll be crazy.
Of course you've got to,

2742
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:13,410
yeah,
with development of any new technology,

2743
02:12:13,411 --> 02:12:16,920
you've got to be a cautious about it.
Um,

2744
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:22,700
but ultimately it seems like we should 
be able to get to the point where we 

2745
02:12:22,711 --> 02:12:24,990
have tastier,
cheaper,

2746
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:30,350
more healthy meat that uses far less 
carbon like has far less carbon dioxide 

2747
02:12:31,261 --> 02:12:34,530
as a side effect uses far less land 
area.

2748
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:36,330
It's going to be better than every 
single way.

2749
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:38,850
And I mean,
I think the science,

2750
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:42,030
it does seem hard in particular just to 
get the costs down low enough.

2751
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:43,930
Well,
I think they've got it down pretty low.

2752
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:45,370
I mean there was a recent article about 
it,

2753
02:12:45,371 --> 02:12:50,371
whether we're talking about the original
one was worth hundreds of thousands of 

2754
02:12:50,371 --> 02:12:50,800
dollars and now they've got it down to 
like 20 bucks.

2755
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:53,350
Yeah,
I think that was misleading wasn't.

2756
02:12:53,450 --> 02:12:54,320
Yeah,
it's a shame.

2757
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:00,520
It seemed to me like there's a,
been a little bit too much hype in 

2758
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:00,520
between,
um,

2759
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:02,060
where.
Yeah,

2760
02:13:02,061 --> 02:13:04,580
there's some stories of like the costs a
lot of [inaudible] going down.

2761
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:06,430
Whereas,
um,

2762
02:13:06,470 --> 02:13:11,470
it's definitely much lower than that.
I think it's definitely still decades 

2763
02:13:11,470 --> 02:13:11,470
away,
decades.

2764
02:13:11,470 --> 02:13:11,810
Yeah,
I think so.

2765
02:13:11,811 --> 02:13:16,811
Really what makes you think decades?
So the argument is that the currently 

2766
02:13:16,811 --> 02:13:21,281
the,
so it depends on what you're talking 

2767
02:13:21,281 --> 02:13:21,281
about.
I'm like,

2768
02:13:21,281 --> 02:13:23,840
egg white I think is Pez competitively.
Um,

2769
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:27,850
milk is comparatively easy but 
structured meet so you know,

2770
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:30,610
steak or chicken that has a structure.
Um,

2771
02:13:31,590 --> 02:13:32,220
that's,

2772
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:37,310
I think very difficult and I think 
apparently part of what the difficulty 

2773
02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:39,930
is there's a certain solution that you 
need to go with this meat and,

2774
02:13:39,931 --> 02:13:41,790
and that solution is currently very 
expensive.

2775
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:47,420
Um,
and the key part of the cost and even 

2776
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:48,360
once we get to the point of being able 
to develop this,

2777
02:13:48,361 --> 02:13:49,650
getting the costs down low enough so 
it's,

2778
02:13:49,690 --> 02:13:52,260
it's competitive,
you're going to need to take this.

2779
02:13:52,350 --> 02:13:56,310
I'm fluid that currently costs,
I don't know how much,

2780
02:13:56,350 --> 02:14:01,350
like a thousand dollars a liter liter 
get it down to the cost of soda and we 

2781
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:04,770
don't currently,
it seems like a clear kind of scientific

2782
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:08,190
who would be the ultimate Turner 
Syndrome if they found out that the only

2783
02:14:08,191 --> 02:14:13,191
way to make that fluid and to make it 
financially viable is to make it out of 

2784
02:14:13,191 --> 02:14:16,110
ground up.
Pets will get killed anyway.

2785
02:14:16,111 --> 02:14:21,111
Euthanized pet.
So at liquid people be upset if they 

2786
02:14:21,111 --> 02:14:24,051
took euthanize pets and they used it to 
make the fluid to grow the artificial 

2787
02:14:24,051 --> 02:14:26,460
meeting or would they prefer those 
euthanize pets just be cremated?

2788
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:30,000
So at the moment that fluid does have to
come from animals.

2789
02:14:30,290 --> 02:14:33,540
Certain parts of it that is animal based
was just guessing.

2790
02:14:33,590 --> 02:14:36,060
Um,
so it's not exactly,

2791
02:14:36,061 --> 02:14:37,500
um,
ground up pets.

2792
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:43,320
I'm just,
I understand it's still currently not 

2793
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:44,670
Vegan,
but it's interesting.

2794
02:14:44,671 --> 02:14:49,671
I think it's going to change.
I mean I do think given the level of 

2795
02:14:49,671 --> 02:14:51,450
just model cognitive dissonance that's 
currently going on,

2796
02:14:51,740 --> 02:14:54,420
people's attitudes to animals,
pets,

2797
02:14:54,570 --> 02:14:57,030
any animal they can see and consumption 
of meat.

2798
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:00,120
Once you take self infest out of the 
equation,

2799
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:03,090
once you've got meat that is cheaper and
just as tasty,

2800
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:06,750
I think just everyone's going to switch 
and then within a generation people will

2801
02:15:06,751 --> 02:15:08,940
look back at the current generation and 
just think,

2802
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:14,000
how did anyone ever engage in such 
abominable activity as factory farmed 

2803
02:15:15,781 --> 02:15:16,800
meat?
Yeah.

2804
02:15:16,801 --> 02:15:21,801
Well it's probably one of the darkest 
things that we as a civilized humanity 

2805
02:15:22,861 --> 02:15:23,250
do.

2806
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:25,920
When you.
When you think about other than war,

2807
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:31,280
which is obviously the most horrific 
thing or one of the most horrific 

2808
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:35,091
things.
I mean it's arguable that in terms of 

2809
02:15:35,091 --> 02:15:35,960
suffering,
it's the next thing because it's.

2810
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:37,740
I mean it has to be the,
it is the next thing,

2811
02:15:37,741 --> 02:15:42,741
right?
So other than poisoning people for 

2812
02:15:42,741 --> 02:15:42,741
profit,
you know,

2813
02:15:42,741 --> 02:15:46,311
other than companies that have polluted 
environments that have won a poisoning 

2814
02:15:46,311 --> 02:15:46,311
people.
Yeah.

2815
02:15:46,311 --> 02:15:51,110
So in terms of animals,
so 50 billion animals are killed every 

2816
02:15:51,110 --> 02:15:51,240
year for human consumption.
Want worldwide,

2817
02:15:51,241 --> 02:15:56,241
most of them have kind of short life.
So a layer.

2818
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:59,310
No,
broiler hens have six week lives.

2819
02:15:59,910 --> 02:16:01,650
That's crazy.
Six weeks.

2820
02:16:01,850 --> 02:16:06,480
So from the time they're incubated to 
the time they're in a oven six weeks,

2821
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:07,230
that's not.
Yeah.

2822
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:12,380
And I think that nuts,
the point at which they die is that the 

2823
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:15,111
highlight of their life and my view,
because their life is just filled with 

2824
02:16:15,111 --> 02:16:15,510
suffering.
And uh,

2825
02:16:16,410 --> 02:16:21,410
so that means any at any one time,
the 7 billion animals in factory farms 

2826
02:16:21,410 --> 02:16:23,790
now living basically being tortured for 
the entirety of their short lives.

2827
02:16:23,791 --> 02:16:26,280
So the entire population of the human 
race,

2828
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:28,810
it's basically one to one yet at any one
time,

2829
02:16:29,650 --> 02:16:30,240
isn't nuts

2830
02:16:30,240 --> 02:16:32,080
that,
that's less than 100 years old.

2831
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:34,990
Yet much less than that.
Less than 50 years old.

2832
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:36,730
Fifty years old.
Really?

2833
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:40,660
That's the first crazy asshole that 
jammed those chickens,

2834
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:42,850
those little cages,
Henley field.

2835
02:16:42,851 --> 02:16:44,410
I think that's the guy.
His name.

2836
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:48,580
So he fascinating it of the free 
marketeers.

2837
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:51,120
Um,
so back in the fifties I'm getting,

2838
02:16:51,121 --> 02:16:53,310
I'm going to go into a digression,
but it's not as bad as the affinity.

2839
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:55,330
I promise you.
They're all awesome.

2840
02:16:56,800 --> 02:17:01,400
So back in the fifties I'm free market 
economics was just completely dead.

2841
02:17:01,401 --> 02:17:06,340
That was just not a mainstream idea toll
within academic economics,

2842
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:11,940
but it really,
if I was to prominence acos end of the 

2843
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:14,731
sixties,
certainly the seventies and then fetch 

2844
02:17:14,731 --> 02:17:16,910
and logan getting empowered,
huge uptake in this intellectual 

2845
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:18,610
movement.
And so the question is kind of where did

2846
02:17:18,611 --> 02:17:23,611
it come from?
And it was actually very significantly 

2847
02:17:23,611 --> 02:17:26,980
driven by a small number of people in 
the fifties and early sixties.

2848
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:29,260
Like very deliberately saying,
okay,

2849
02:17:29,261 --> 02:17:34,261
I want,
we want this ideology to become really 

2850
02:17:34,261 --> 02:17:36,601
dominant.
And one of the most important first 

2851
02:17:36,601 --> 02:17:38,680
organizations was the institute for 
Economic Affairs based in London,

2852
02:17:38,681 --> 02:17:43,681
I think tank and it was funded by the 
person who put the factory farm chicken 

2853
02:17:43,681 --> 02:17:46,450
to listen.
So,

2854
02:17:46,451 --> 02:17:51,451
um,
it's weird because I promote this idea 

2855
02:17:51,451 --> 02:17:54,370
of I'm earning to give as something that
young people should consider.

2856
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,290
No,
it's the only thing that they should do.

2857
02:17:56,291 --> 02:17:58,210
But as one of many things they should 
do,

2858
02:17:58,590 --> 02:18:01,240
a should consider doing.
If you want to do good,

2859
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:03,730
you could go and like directly have an 
impact.

2860
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:08,940
But there is also another option which 
is doing something you're really 

2861
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:11,590
passionate about that maybe has less of 
a direct impact on a lot and donate,

2862
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:16,860
um,
what you're making at least a 

2863
02:18:16,860 --> 02:18:17,140
significant part of that to the things 
you think are most important.

2864
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:19,540
And then I think of this,
I think it's Henry Fisher,

2865
02:18:19,550 --> 02:18:24,550
sorry.
This is like this most perverse 

2866
02:18:24,550 --> 02:18:25,620
instantiation of that where the guy 
went,

2867
02:18:25,650 --> 02:18:30,300
became a factory farming entrepreneur.
Basically any ticket I give glands.

2868
02:18:31,070 --> 02:18:32,060
And so,
uh,

2869
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:37,170
isn't that just so indicative of how 
humans are so contradictory were so 

2870
02:18:37,841 --> 02:18:42,841
complex and so strange and that we will 
find all these justifications for all 

2871
02:18:43,001 --> 02:18:48,001
these bizarre behaviors.
And then we were never like totally 

2872
02:18:48,001 --> 02:18:49,090
pure.
Like there's so many,

2873
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:53,230
so many people that are so that.
This is a terrible example,

2874
02:18:53,231 --> 02:18:57,370
but it's the one I use all the time.
Bill cosby made so many people laugh and

2875
02:18:57,371 --> 02:19:00,460
he raped about $100 or whatever.
Allegedly,

2876
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:05,520
you know,
like he was helping and putting out so 

2877
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:09,151
much love to so many people and then 
being fucking evil to a bunch of people 

2878
02:19:09,461 --> 02:19:10,090
that he drug.

2879
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:13,260
Yeah.
Or if they just know that this exists,

2880
02:19:13,261 --> 02:19:17,130
this duality that they think about Nazi 
Germany,

2881
02:19:17,131 --> 02:19:19,890
you think about the number of people who
are involved in the Holocaust,

2882
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:21,810
who loved their children and their 
children,

2883
02:19:21,811 --> 02:19:24,300
and if you talk to them,
you would have had a great conversation.

2884
02:19:24,301 --> 02:19:25,770
They would have been very caring and so 
on.

2885
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:27,680
This is,
I mean,

2886
02:19:27,681 --> 02:19:29,780
yeah,
it's a very powerful idea.

2887
02:19:30,650 --> 02:19:35,650
The banality of evil.
I'm having events phase where,

2888
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:42,190
yeah,
the worst crimes committed and not 

2889
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:46,481
because people are bad.
It's because [inaudible] not bad or evil

2890
02:19:46,491 --> 02:19:51,491
in the way that you think James Bond 
villain like this person's plotting 

2891
02:19:51,491 --> 02:19:54,611
something.
It's just because they have some goal 

2892
02:19:54,611 --> 02:19:57,820
that is some goal in which they 
indifference to suffering and the cause 

2893
02:19:58,191 --> 02:20:01,430
that as a side effect.
And so it's the same if you ask people,

2894
02:20:01,431 --> 02:20:04,690
do you want animals to suffer that 
ethically in factory farms will say,

2895
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:05,540
no,
of course not.

2896
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:08,390
It's just I don't care.
Casualties of war.

2897
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:10,640
Exactly.
And casualties of civilization.

2898
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:14,660
And the same insight actually when we 
talk about ai as well as,

2899
02:20:14,661 --> 02:20:16,220
um,
you know,

2900
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:18,140
sometimes in the media people say,
oh,

2901
02:20:18,141 --> 02:20:21,080
the worry about ai as a terminator,
it's going to want to kill humans,

2902
02:20:21,081 --> 02:20:26,081
but that's not the wedding at all.
The idea when you think about homo 

2903
02:20:26,081 --> 02:20:26,780
sapiens and neanderthals,
again,

2904
02:20:26,781 --> 02:20:30,860
it's just having some other entity that 
has goals on which you are just not very

2905
02:20:30,861 --> 02:20:31,850
important.
Right.

2906
02:20:32,110 --> 02:20:33,470
Um,
and that means that,

2907
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:33,830
yeah,

2908
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:36,480
well,
and they're also going to judge us.

2909
02:20:36,530 --> 02:20:41,530
I mean,
if they are intelligent and they are 

2910
02:20:41,530 --> 02:20:43,671
superior to us,
they're going to judge us based on the 

2911
02:20:43,671 --> 02:20:43,671
entire,
whole of our behavior.

2912
02:20:43,671 --> 02:20:45,600
And they're going to go look at this 
messy species.

2913
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:50,900
This species is crazy.
Elon mucks mosque has my most terrifying

2914
02:20:51,390 --> 02:20:52,460
quote.
Uh,

2915
02:20:52,660 --> 02:20:57,660
he,
his quote is the most terrifying to me 

2916
02:20:57,660 --> 02:20:58,440
that he thinks that with ai we are 
summoning the demon king,

2917
02:20:58,441 --> 02:20:59,070
the demon.
Yeah.

2918
02:20:59,071 --> 02:21:00,820
I love that quote.
That's just like.

2919
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:02,190
I mean,
I want A.

2920
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:07,200
Yeah.
Like I think a lot of the media 

2921
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:08,991
attention around ai is like,
has been really unfortunate because it 

2922
02:21:08,991 --> 02:21:10,800
suggests like it's coming next year and 
it's gonna Control.

2923
02:21:10,801 --> 02:21:14,940
It's like the demon.
I think anthropomorphized is necessarily

2924
02:21:14,941 --> 02:21:16,680
and so on,
sort of I think,

2925
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:19,590
but if it's ultimate goals,
the extinction of the human race,

2926
02:21:19,591 --> 02:21:21,740
that's very demonic in our regard.
Yeah.

2927
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:26,760
I mean it's more indifferent than sort 
of the way we think about mollusks.

2928
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:29,070
Yeah.
Yeah,

2929
02:21:29,071 --> 02:21:30,620
exactly.
The other way we think of like,

2930
02:21:31,140 --> 02:21:36,140
you know,
mosquitoes mosquitoes with my favorite 

2931
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:37,590
because vegans are slap mosquitoes.
Oh yeah.

2932
02:21:37,591 --> 02:21:41,610
I mean I'm get mosquitoes are not like 
they're alive.

2933
02:21:42,390 --> 02:21:43,430
Yeah.
But are they like,

2934
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:46,260
I think clams mollusks on 70 and then 
insects.

2935
02:21:46,261 --> 02:21:46,950
I'm like,
well,

2936
02:21:46,951 --> 02:21:50,340
there's some weird arguments about that 
then mean why not eat crickets?

2937
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:54,190
Because cricket protein is excellent.
I've had cricket bars before.

2938
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:55,920
They're covered in chocolate.
They taste really good.

2939
02:21:55,921 --> 02:21:57,060
They're high protein.

2940
02:21:58,040 --> 02:22:03,040
Many.
I do know many people who do advocate 

2941
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:06,970
for that.
My view is just like if you're unsure 

2942
02:22:06,970 --> 02:22:06,970
then play safe.

2943
02:22:06,970 --> 02:22:07,230
MMM.
And you'd be eating a lot of crickets,

2944
02:22:07,330 --> 02:22:08,250
like.
Yeah.

2945
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:10,030
But there's a lot of crickets out there 
to you.

2946
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:12,660
Well,
if you're,

2947
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:16,610
could them like might be hunting tickets
with a tiny little spear.

2948
02:22:17,010 --> 02:22:18,150
I don't think I.
How you do it,

2949
02:22:18,580 --> 02:22:20,190
you're a lot more brutal than that.
I mean,

2950
02:22:20,191 --> 02:22:23,490
I think factory farming for crickets.
It'd be a horrific institution,

2951
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:25,050
you know,
and you just.

2952
02:22:25,350 --> 02:22:26,040
What would you do?

2953
02:22:26,110 --> 02:22:29,760
Just fucking swarms of them.
The smash them down to a protein bar.

2954
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:32,730
I would,
I worry about.

2955
02:22:32,731 --> 02:22:35,610
Is that,
what is the current number of the amount

2956
02:22:35,611 --> 02:22:37,950
of species that have ever existed that 
are now extinct?

2957
02:22:38,510 --> 02:22:40,620
It's fucking huge.
90 nine point nine,

2958
02:22:40,621 --> 02:22:42,270
nine percent or something?
Why not us?

2959
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:43,770
Why not us?
Oh yeah.

2960
02:22:43,771 --> 02:22:46,050
And if we do give birth to artificial 
intelligence,

2961
02:22:46,051 --> 02:22:51,051
if we are the caterpillar that gives 
birth to the butterfly that winds up 

2962
02:22:51,051 --> 02:22:52,980
taking over the world some artificial 
butterfly.

2963
02:22:53,710 --> 02:22:54,250
Yeah,
I mean,

2964
02:22:54,251 --> 02:22:57,280
I think the thing that worries me is 
that,

2965
02:22:57,930 --> 02:23:00,760
you know,
it's ai is it's kind of its own thing.

2966
02:23:01,390 --> 02:23:02,920
Um,
and I think,

2967
02:23:03,430 --> 02:23:08,430
you know,
we do because it's like potentially 

2968
02:23:08,430 --> 02:23:09,040
extremely beneficial as well.
And if it goes,

2969
02:23:09,070 --> 02:23:14,070
even if supposing it goes well,
then it's a huge thing like we should 

2970
02:23:14,070 --> 02:23:17,491
care about it whether or not we're 
worried about the extinction risk 

2971
02:23:17,491 --> 02:23:20,320
because it's one of the things,
one of the later cases I think where we 

2972
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:20,500
can really see into the future and 
think,

2973
02:23:20,501 --> 02:23:25,501
yes,
this is going to be a transformative 

2974
02:23:25,501 --> 02:23:25,501
technology.
We don't know when it's gonna happen,

2975
02:23:25,501 --> 02:23:26,410
but when it does,
when it does,

2976
02:23:26,411 --> 02:23:29,110
it's going to be tons formative and it's
going to be very powerful.

2977
02:23:29,111 --> 02:23:32,260
And that means we should have some kind 
of careful thought about it.

2978
02:23:32,890 --> 02:23:37,890
But it seems to me there's a variety of 
ways that the human race could kill 

2979
02:23:37,890 --> 02:23:37,890
itself.
Now.

2980
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:42,820
So novel pathogens being one example,
large Hadron collider.

2981
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:49,950
So my colleague toby actually wrote a 
paper on the large Hadron collider 

2982
02:23:52,030 --> 02:23:53,140
because there was always,
you know,

2983
02:23:53,170 --> 02:23:55,510
talking about,
oh we could hold and so on.

2984
02:23:56,050 --> 02:24:01,050
And so he either an academic paper where
he just talked about the risk analysis 

2985
02:24:01,181 --> 02:24:02,500
that they did.
And they said,

2986
02:24:02,530 --> 02:24:07,530
oh,
the chance of the large Hadron collider 

2987
02:24:07,530 --> 02:24:08,240
creating a black hole or something else.
It was like really dangerous.

2988
02:24:08,241 --> 02:24:10,330
Is Ten to the power of negative 60 feet.

2989
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:12,690
You know what,
that's not going zero.

2990
02:24:12,790 --> 02:24:14,010
It's not zero.
Firstly,

2991
02:24:14,011 --> 02:24:16,390
it's not zero was motherfuckers that 
could addiction.

2992
02:24:16,630 --> 02:24:19,120
What if we put the odds were really 
long.

2993
02:24:19,121 --> 02:24:19,890
We didn't know.

2994
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:22,770
But the second thing also is that,
um,

2995
02:24:23,190 --> 02:24:25,110
it's a,
you shouldn't think that anything's tend

2996
02:24:25,111 --> 02:24:26,230
to the negative 60 feet,
Bailey,

2997
02:24:26,290 --> 02:24:29,020
unless you have very,
very strong models behind,

2998
02:24:29,021 --> 02:24:34,021
right?
Because what's the chance that you just 

2999
02:24:34,021 --> 02:24:34,021
made some mistake in your calculation?
It's like,

3000
02:24:34,021 --> 02:24:38,661
you know,
maybe it's as low as one in a million 

3001
02:24:38,661 --> 02:24:41,230
that mistake completely swamped.
And so that was the point he was making 

3002
02:24:41,230 --> 02:24:43,860
just statistical point saying,
look,

3003
02:24:43,950 --> 02:24:46,140
I'm not commenting on whether this is 
dangerous or not,

3004
02:24:46,290 --> 02:24:48,360
it's just that you've made a mistake in 
your methodology,

3005
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:50,940
um,
with respect to your risk assessment.

3006
02:24:51,300 --> 02:24:53,130
And so it was really funny because then 
he was there.

3007
02:24:53,131 --> 02:24:54,840
This is fairly calm,
sensible,

3008
02:24:55,170 --> 02:24:56,600
um,
you know,

3009
02:24:56,700 --> 02:25:01,500
a philosopher from Oxford in a meeting 
with lunch either and Kaleida surrounded

3010
02:25:01,501 --> 02:25:02,740
by all the,
um,

3011
02:25:03,380 --> 02:25:04,020
you know,
uh,

3012
02:25:04,570 --> 02:25:07,560
elementum like tin foil,
tin foil,

3013
02:25:07,561 --> 02:25:10,570
hat people,
aluminum file minium.

3014
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:12,450
I love the way you guys say aluminum 
right now.

3015
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:15,420
Apparently I'm.
I was so annoyed when I found this.

3016
02:25:15,421 --> 02:25:16,270
But penalty.
Your,

3017
02:25:16,470 --> 02:25:21,470
your way is correct and it's just a 
weird area tire with an I really.

3018
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:24,100
And

3019
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:27,610
then you start saying things like click.
Oh,

3020
02:25:27,611 --> 02:25:31,060
there's a nice click of people in the 
niche and the fire.

3021
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:35,210
Oh,
you say it's a niche for for.

3022
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:36,190
Yeah,
for.

3023
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:37,090
Yeah,
for.

3024
02:25:37,130 --> 02:25:38,320
Yeah.
We say for here though,

3025
02:25:38,350 --> 02:25:41,020
do people say four year?
So I've definitely heard for you.

3026
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:45,490
Walmart people was a white trash.
Where are you from originally?

3027
02:25:45,550 --> 02:25:48,340
Where am I from?
New Jersey is where I was born because I

3028
02:25:48,341 --> 02:25:50,350
thought it was a New York thing,
but maybe,

3029
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:52,720
maybe not.
Maybe I didn't really grow up there.

3030
02:25:52,830 --> 02:25:54,900
Grew up all over the place.
Boston mostly.

3031
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:56,020
Yeah.
But you know,

3032
02:25:56,021 --> 02:25:57,470
you do.
You do so many things long.

3033
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:59,560
It's very,
it's very distressing to me.

3034
02:25:59,561 --> 02:26:01,240
I'll tell you what we don't do.
We don't do Queens.

3035
02:26:01,241 --> 02:26:03,990
You guys still have queens?
I love the Queen Shit.

3036
02:26:04,550 --> 02:26:06,760
She's still going.
It's so funny.

3037
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:09,950
I feel like every time I go,
no.

3038
02:26:10,730 --> 02:26:13,330
I think the queen is like hilarious 
institution.

3039
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:20,500
That's his job always to like wave and 
this wave she just kind of rocks her 

3040
02:26:20,761 --> 02:26:24,210
hand back and forth.
Some sort of weird semi vulcan stance.

3041
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:25,830
Um,
it's Kinda funny.

3042
02:26:25,831 --> 02:26:30,831
Yeah.
Talking to especially some of the kind 

3043
02:26:30,831 --> 02:26:31,310
of pick last of friends I have in a 
medical,

3044
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:34,500
like you've got a monarchy,
everyone talking about it.

3045
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:36,450
If you guys like it's quaint.
Yeah.

3046
02:26:36,451 --> 02:26:40,430
We're just like no one really thinks 
about her.

3047
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:45,680
Right.
But she still lives in a fucking castle 

3048
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:45,680
and the castle,
she lives off the dime.

3049
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:48,510
But if you do an economic analysis,
she brings in more money than she,

3050
02:26:48,860 --> 02:26:50,250
um,
sort of.

3051
02:26:50,251 --> 02:26:53,070
But she takes a lot.
She's sort of the anti will macaskill if

3052
02:26:53,071 --> 02:26:54,190
you asked me.
Yeah,

3053
02:26:54,191 --> 02:26:59,191
that's,
I mean the test is they support and she 

3054
02:26:59,191 --> 02:27:01,101
just gets all this free money and that 
bitch just wears gold and shit and 

3055
02:27:01,101 --> 02:27:01,101
drives around in a limo.

3056
02:27:01,101 --> 02:27:02,730
It's kind of ridiculous.
So you could,

3057
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:03,720
yeah,
you could definitely,

3058
02:27:03,721 --> 02:27:05,520
uh,
get the same tour.

3059
02:27:05,521 --> 02:27:06,900
Doesn't benefit people are mad.
I say,

3060
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:09,060
bitch,
I'm not really meaning the word bitch,

3061
02:27:09,090 --> 02:27:12,180
so I could all due respect folks.
Just a figure of speech,

3062
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:14,280
a humorous figure speech.
Okay.

3063
02:27:14,281 --> 02:27:15,820
Well I appreciate the.
Yeah.

3064
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:19,530
I don't want to disparage your ruler.
The cliche,

3065
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:21,960
the caveat.
Such a strange rule though.

3066
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:26,820
Kings and Queens and Prince Charles.
It's really funny.

3067
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:29,610
Pov that sculpture.
So I keep.

3068
02:27:29,820 --> 02:27:32,730
It's so funny because I keep.
I spent a lot of time in California,

3069
02:27:32,731 --> 02:27:37,170
but every time I come back it seems to 
be on some major event to do with ilt.

3070
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:42,380
So one was the queen's birthday,
one was the event of the Queens being 

3071
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:44,310
the longest ever running monarch.
When was the jubilee.

3072
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:49,640
We don't know about that at all.
Those things for you is these massive 

3073
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:51,170
events.
It just means I come off the plane being

3074
02:27:51,180 --> 02:27:53,880
in America for a while and then it's 
just pictures of the queen.

3075
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,830
Everyone say okay.
Yeah,

3076
02:27:55,831 --> 02:27:59,200
I'm definitely back in play tea now.
Now what's going on now?

3077
02:27:59,201 --> 02:28:01,090
And I think crazy.
What's happening now.

3078
02:28:01,170 --> 02:28:03,120
Yeah,
huge news today.

3079
02:28:03,210 --> 02:28:04,110
What?
Um,

3080
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:07,260
well for me as a skunk,
I'm Nicholas Sturgeon,

3081
02:28:07,270 --> 02:28:12,270
the first minister of Scotland.
A kind of think of Scotland to the UK is

3082
02:28:15,450 --> 02:28:17,760
state to federal level,
but it's a little bit different.

3083
02:28:18,260 --> 02:28:20,580
Um,
announced there's gonna be a second.

3084
02:28:20,700 --> 02:28:22,580
She's planning second Scottish 
referendum.

3085
02:28:23,210 --> 02:28:28,210
So because the,
because Britain is taking yourself out 

3086
02:28:28,210 --> 02:28:32,741
of the European Union where they expect 
is that announcing can meet Tuesday end 

3087
02:28:33,831 --> 02:28:35,540
of month,
but it's very shortly.

3088
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:39,350
I'm,
Scotland did not want to leave.

3089
02:28:39,380 --> 02:28:42,920
The EU voted overwhelmingly in favor of 
remaining.

3090
02:28:43,180 --> 02:28:46,370
So Scotland in general,
it tends to lean a lot further left than

3091
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:48,310
the rest of the UK.
Um,

3092
02:28:48,380 --> 02:28:50,270
and previously had an independence 
referendum.

3093
02:28:50,271 --> 02:28:53,150
It was very close,
actually 52 percent,

3094
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:58,660
um,
within favor of staying apart for the 

3095
02:28:58,660 --> 02:28:59,420
union.
So the state of the Union,

3096
02:28:59,780 --> 02:29:04,780
um,
there's now going to be a second 

3097
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:04,780
referendum.
These,

3098
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:05,300
this is what Nicola Sturgeon is saying.
Um,

3099
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:11,170
and because of the Brexit vote,
I think it's much more likely that 

3100
02:29:11,170 --> 02:29:11,630
Scotland will say,
yes,

3101
02:29:11,631 --> 02:29:16,631
we're going to leave.
And then they have the main part of the 

3102
02:29:16,631 --> 02:29:16,631
European Union where there's the last of
Litton,

3103
02:29:16,631 --> 02:29:18,170
um,
will leave.

3104
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:23,680
And it's interesting for me because I 
was very kind of play with the union 

3105
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:25,060
against independence in the previous,
um,

3106
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:31,300
referendum now I'm not sure now,
I think I probably am in it because I 

3107
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:32,900
think that brexit was just such bad 
decision,

3108
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:38,400
um,
that I kind of want them to be punished 

3109
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:38,400
for that.

3110
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:38,960
And well,
I think there's two things.

3111
02:29:38,961 --> 02:29:39,880
One is the,
um,

3112
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:46,240
I think that now the case for Scotland 
being part of the EU but not part of 

3113
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:47,730
Britain,
the economic case can,

3114
02:29:47,731 --> 02:29:50,180
it makes a bit more sense now than it 
did in the past.

3115
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:54,210
But then secondly,
just I would kind of worry that um,

3116
02:29:55,430 --> 02:29:56,810
Britain leaves the EU,
EU,

3117
02:29:56,811 --> 02:30:00,330
does that trigger kind of spark like,
you know,

3118
02:30:00,331 --> 02:30:04,460
a much larger movement where the just 
the EU as a project kind of breaks down.

3119
02:30:05,090 --> 02:30:07,700
Um,
and if it's the case like,

3120
02:30:07,710 --> 02:30:10,010
well,
UK leaves the EU,

3121
02:30:10,011 --> 02:30:12,050
but as a result the country just falls 
apart.

3122
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:15,920
I think that you wanted that to happen.
You wanted England to fall apart,

3123
02:30:15,950 --> 02:30:17,870
to be punished for leaving the

3124
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:21,530
be like a very major signal.
Like I don't think it would be.

3125
02:30:21,531 --> 02:30:24,010
What if they prospered?
They were,

3126
02:30:25,030 --> 02:30:26,500
oh yeah.
I mean then if it is,

3127
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:30,010
if I do got.
If I was convinced that the blacks,

3128
02:30:30,011 --> 02:30:35,011
that was the late decision that was 
actually best for the world and then I 

3129
02:30:35,011 --> 02:30:35,011
would change my mind.

3130
02:30:35,011 --> 02:30:39,440
I don't know enough about it,
but I do have a friend who's very 

3131
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:39,440
knowledgeable and he's from England and 
he.

3132
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:44,270
His take on it was the real issue with 
the EU is that you're dealing with a 

3133
02:30:45,451 --> 02:30:46,980
bunch of people that aren't even 
elected.

3134
02:30:47,230 --> 02:30:50,460
They're just sort of running the 
European Union and he's like,

3135
02:30:50,730 --> 02:30:54,480
and we don't have to tell you when you 
just look at history,

3136
02:30:54,750 --> 02:30:59,750
what happens when people have a great 
amount of power and aren't even elected 

3137
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:03,411
to their position and you're allowed to 
just go to any part of the European 

3138
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:07,710
Union and move into it.
He's like,

3139
02:31:07,740 --> 02:31:12,740
that was very detrimental and very bad 
in terms of the way England's financial 

3140
02:31:13,831 --> 02:31:15,540
structure was set up.
They were like,

3141
02:31:15,541 --> 02:31:17,340
this could.
This would be detrimental to England,

3142
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:21,000
but beneficial to other places and the 
idea was that we were supposed to accept

3143
02:31:21,001 --> 02:31:26,001
the fact that it'd be detrimental to 
England and beneficial to other 

3144
02:31:26,001 --> 02:31:27,360
countries and many people in England did
not want to do that.

3145
02:31:27,361 --> 02:31:29,460
And in doing and in making that 
decision,

3146
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:34,670
they were thought to be Zena phobic.
They were thought to be a nationalistic 

3147
02:31:34,670 --> 02:31:35,070
and that it was racist.

3148
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:36,660
So I think there's,
um,

3149
02:31:37,770 --> 02:31:38,400
yeah,
two things.

3150
02:31:38,401 --> 02:31:39,330
I mean,
one thing is yeah,

3151
02:31:39,331 --> 02:31:40,620
I don't like,
um,

3152
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:41,910
yeah,
I mean,

3153
02:31:41,911 --> 02:31:46,911
so there's kind of two things.
One where the specter of their 

3154
02:31:46,911 --> 02:31:46,911
sovereignty question,
um,

3155
02:31:46,911 --> 02:31:51,110
I mean like European Union,
like it has its own parliament and so 

3156
02:31:51,110 --> 02:31:51,110
on.
You can vote on that.

3157
02:31:51,110 --> 02:31:55,281
You each get number of electors and the 
reason in so far as it's undemocratic,

3158
02:31:55,651 --> 02:32:00,651
it's mainly just because people don't 
care like the don't care democratic,

3159
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:05,640
but t as in voter,
so turnout to have elections for members

3160
02:32:05,641 --> 02:32:07,890
of European Parliament.
The turnout is very low.

3161
02:32:07,891 --> 02:32:09,330
I think it's like 30 percent sort of 
thing.

3162
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:12,210
Maybe it will be larger now they realize
the consequences of it.

3163
02:32:12,270 --> 02:32:12,690
Well,
I mean,

3164
02:32:12,691 --> 02:32:14,500
there's not going to be anymore because 
it's gonna,

3165
02:32:14,710 --> 02:32:16,830
it's gonna leave implode.
Well,

3166
02:32:16,831 --> 02:32:21,831
Benton's leaving Britain's leaving,
so you no longer voting for members of 

3167
02:32:21,831 --> 02:32:21,831
parliament.

3168
02:32:21,831 --> 02:32:26,390
Um,
so that's one question and then like is 

3169
02:32:26,390 --> 02:32:26,390
this good or bad split?
And um,

3170
02:32:26,550 --> 02:32:31,550
I think like the economic case is just 
incredibly swung for European kind of 

3171
02:32:32,371 --> 02:32:37,371
good for the reason being just like 
fleet fade in general benefits both 

3172
02:32:37,371 --> 02:32:42,171
parties.
You want to really maximize the amount 

3173
02:32:42,171 --> 02:32:42,171
of fleet late.
Um,

3174
02:32:42,171 --> 02:32:46,250
but then the bigger thing for me,
it's just like with respect to unity 

3175
02:32:46,250 --> 02:32:51,201
between countries is like the tail risk 
risk of war,

3176
02:32:52,470 --> 02:32:57,470
which we don't really think about 
because we haven't had a like a world 

3177
02:32:57,470 --> 02:32:57,470
war since,
um,

3178
02:32:57,470 --> 02:32:57,750
you know,
the early,

3179
02:32:58,230 --> 02:33:00,200
mid 20th century,
um,

3180
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:05,750
but Europe had had like a long period of
comparative peacefulness like before the

3181
02:33:05,761 --> 02:33:06,870
first world war.
People thought,

3182
02:33:06,871 --> 02:33:11,871
no,
it's unthinkable given the level of 

3183
02:33:11,871 --> 02:33:14,061
interconnectedness between the countries
that are World War can play count and 

3184
02:33:14,061 --> 02:33:14,061
intuited.
Right.

3185
02:33:14,061 --> 02:33:15,060
Um,
and so,

3186
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:16,400
and I think those sorts of things would 
be,

3187
02:33:16,730 --> 02:33:18,260
you know,
the tail outcome,

3188
02:33:18,280 --> 02:33:20,380
it can be very bad indeed.
Um,

3189
02:33:20,490 --> 02:33:25,490
and we don't often think about it 
because it's just this occasional thing 

3190
02:33:25,490 --> 02:33:28,200
and so that's why in general and just 
always more like not all,

3191
02:33:28,201 --> 02:33:32,490
almost always more pillow.
I'm closer relations between,

3192
02:33:33,030 --> 02:33:34,440
um,
between companies

3193
02:33:34,770 --> 02:33:36,060
that makes sense to me.
Um,

3194
02:33:36,210 --> 02:33:39,330
what he said makes sense to me as well 
though when he was saying essentially it

3195
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:44,331
was like think of the United States,
but now think of each state being 

3196
02:33:44,331 --> 02:33:46,590
country.
You're allowed to elect a leader of that

3197
02:33:46,591 --> 02:33:51,591
country,
but you can't elect a leader for the 

3198
02:33:51,591 --> 02:33:54,200
United States.
And so that's essentially how he was 

3199
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:54,200
looking at the European Union.
He was saying the European Union is,

3200
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:59,200
they're not elected and yet there are 
controlling all these other elected 

3201
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:03,681
officials and elected state's all group 
together instead of thinking of them as 

3202
02:34:03,681 --> 02:34:08,130
like Germany and England,
think of them as states and think of the

3203
02:34:08,130 --> 02:34:13,130
European Union and the officials.
The people that are in control of the 

3204
02:34:13,130 --> 02:34:13,130
European Union aren't even elected.

3205
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:13,910
Yeah.
So I mean,

3206
02:34:13,911 --> 02:34:17,120
you do elect the parliament and then 
it's also the case,

3207
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:22,000
the analogy,
like the amount of power that Europe has

3208
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:27,180
over the remaining the other countries.
It's like nothing like the amount of 

3209
02:34:27,941 --> 02:34:32,941
power of the federal government,
the federal government has overstates 

3210
02:34:32,941 --> 02:34:34,750
like um,
you know,

3211
02:34:34,751 --> 02:34:39,751
the UK sets.
So the power is the EU has one of the 

3212
02:34:40,061 --> 02:34:42,760
things that are got made lots of 
attention was bendy,

3213
02:34:42,761 --> 02:34:47,761
bananas.
This guy like a real focus area for 

3214
02:34:47,761 --> 02:34:48,430
people's either also and what does that 
mean?

3215
02:34:48,490 --> 02:34:51,760
So according to EU regulations,
so EU has a single market,

3216
02:34:51,850 --> 02:34:54,850
so that means you have just the same 
standards across all countries,

3217
02:34:56,530 --> 02:35:01,530
but then that means you just start to 
say have the standards of the things 

3218
02:35:01,530 --> 02:35:02,770
like bananas.
And so there was one EU regulation which

3219
02:35:02,771 --> 02:35:07,771
was that a banana couldn't be too bendy,
otherwise it would count as a defective 

3220
02:35:07,771 --> 02:35:10,710
banana.
And so people were like up and age about

3221
02:35:10,740 --> 02:35:11,140
this.

3222
02:35:11,180 --> 02:35:14,500
Like how can the EU dictate to us,
um,

3223
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:18,920
the shape of our bananas.
But I think the case is like a good one.

3224
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,410
It's like,
it's really not that important.

3225
02:35:20,411 --> 02:35:25,411
It's just a banana.
Why are they even going to regulate it 

3226
02:35:25,411 --> 02:35:25,411
then?
Well,

3227
02:35:25,411 --> 02:35:26,150
it's because if you want to have like a 
fee,

3228
02:35:26,270 --> 02:35:31,270
like single market,
you need to have common standards 

3229
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:31,270
across.
Um,

3230
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:34,530
and then this was just marketing 
standards were like the Bendy,

3231
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:37,000
bananas don't sell and then the 
straighter ones do.

3232
02:35:37,810 --> 02:35:38,440
Yeah,
I mean,

3233
02:35:38,441 --> 02:35:42,040
I don't know more of the detail about 
that seems to be the time the government

3234
02:35:42,041 --> 02:35:46,030
steps in on something as fucking 
ridiculous as the bend in the shape of a

3235
02:35:46,031 --> 02:35:47,260
banana and be like,
hey,

3236
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:49,060
fuck face.
Why don't you go take care of poverty?

3237
02:35:49,540 --> 02:35:50,620
You know,
why don't you,

3238
02:35:50,650 --> 02:35:53,920
why don't you handle something real 
instead of dealing with bendy bananas.

3239
02:35:53,950 --> 02:35:55,900
Look.
So on the Bendy Madonna's case.

3240
02:35:56,110 --> 02:35:57,850
Yeah.
I can't off the top of my head.

3241
02:35:57,851 --> 02:36:00,270
Think of why you'd want to not allow the
sale.

3242
02:36:00,370 --> 02:36:05,370
But that's what people worry about when 
they worried about bureaucracy when you 

3243
02:36:05,370 --> 02:36:05,370
worried about too much control.
Yeah.

3244
02:36:05,370 --> 02:36:05,620
So,
um,

3245
02:36:05,770 --> 02:36:07,420
that's a great example.
In fact,

3246
02:36:07,620 --> 02:36:12,620
why,
why people don't want micromanaging of 

3247
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:12,620
our culture.
Yeah.

3248
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:15,430
But then the question is do we want to 
leave over bananas?

3249
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:19,720
And I think a lot of other factors,
it's not the bananas that caused it,

3250
02:36:19,721 --> 02:36:24,721
right.
But the thing is the UK as part of the 

3251
02:36:24,721 --> 02:36:24,970
European Union has sovereignty over like
what's income taxes,

3252
02:36:24,971 --> 02:36:29,971
all of its laws as long as they don't 
conflict with the UN Declaration of 

3253
02:36:30,491 --> 02:36:32,860
human rights,
which was first invented by the UK,

3254
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:35,520
has control of a,
um,

3255
02:36:35,530 --> 02:36:36,760
yeah,
all of it's internal,

3256
02:36:36,810 --> 02:36:37,900
um,
legislation,

3257
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:42,300
it completely can go to war if,
once I'm undetected.

3258
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:47,140
So the loss of sovereignty seems pretty 
mild from my perspective.

3259
02:36:47,530 --> 02:36:52,530
And I feel like I feel like they focus 
on these examples,

3260
02:36:52,631 --> 02:36:53,230
which is like,
okay,

3261
02:36:53,231 --> 02:36:55,090
maybe like let's say yeah,
it's okay.

3262
02:36:55,091 --> 02:37:00,091
It's a cost we would like to be able to 
like maybe it'd be better if it could 

3263
02:37:00,091 --> 02:37:02,320
make decision of men as maybe the 
bananas was the bad coal.

3264
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:07,360
Well,
it definitely doesn't seem like a 

3265
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:07,360
universal reaction.
I mean the,

3266
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:08,680
the,
there's a large percentage of the people

3267
02:37:08,681 --> 02:37:11,220
in England are very upset about brexit.
No,

3268
02:37:11,810 --> 02:37:15,250
it's a really interesting sort of a 
divide between people.

3269
02:37:15,510 --> 02:37:20,510
I mean,
the thing that I find fascinating is 

3270
02:37:20,510 --> 02:37:22,250
that we would make,
and I think this in general,

3271
02:37:22,251 --> 02:37:27,251
I think this the elections as well 
because I studied a bunch of voting 

3272
02:37:27,251 --> 02:37:30,521
theory wanting my phd and we make these 
momentous decisions as a country where 

3273
02:37:30,521 --> 02:37:32,750
we get everyone in the population.
That's fine.

3274
02:37:32,751 --> 02:37:37,751
Go to a specific place and then get the 
smallest possible information out of 

3275
02:37:38,211 --> 02:37:43,211
them that you can,
which is just a single tick like yes or 

3276
02:37:43,211 --> 02:37:43,211
no.

3277
02:37:43,211 --> 02:37:43,880
Whereas there's so much more you could 
be doing.

3278
02:37:43,910 --> 02:37:46,820
So in one case with a referendum,
um,

3279
02:37:46,850 --> 02:37:51,850
rather than just at a particular date 
where the turnout is affected by things 

3280
02:37:51,850 --> 02:37:52,730
like the weather,
um,

3281
02:37:53,060 --> 02:37:54,530
it's affected by,
you know,

3282
02:37:54,550 --> 02:37:59,550
what happened in the week before and 
instead you just have figured referenda 

3283
02:37:59,550 --> 02:38:02,840
and given them a mountainous 
momentousness of the decision,

3284
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:06,020
spending more money on,
like actually getting the accurate views

3285
02:38:06,021 --> 02:38:07,670
of the people,
um,

3286
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:09,970
is super important.
So instead,

3287
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:15,040
yeah,
you have free over the period of six 

3288
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:15,040
months and choose the best,
um,

3289
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:18,090
you know,
be best fee basically where there's,

3290
02:38:18,530 --> 02:38:23,530
that would be like a more accurate,
an accurate representation of what 

3291
02:38:23,530 --> 02:38:23,530
people think of a time.
Sure.

3292
02:38:23,530 --> 02:38:27,851
But isn't there also a gigantic issue 
with people not being informed about 

3293
02:38:27,851 --> 02:38:29,810
what they're voting on?
You don't have to be informed about what

3294
02:38:29,811 --> 02:38:34,811
you're voting on.
You certainly don't have to be accurate 

3295
02:38:34,811 --> 02:38:36,851
about what you,
you could easily be misled and the 

3296
02:38:36,851 --> 02:38:39,281
actual hard,
provable facts could be completely 

3297
02:38:39,281 --> 02:38:40,280
outside of your grasp and yet you still 
make a big decision.

3298
02:38:40,580 --> 02:38:45,580
I wondered before about having a um,
attest attest.

3299
02:38:46,551 --> 02:38:47,720
Yeah,
you go like,

3300
02:38:47,770 --> 02:38:49,910
but like really,
really basic.

3301
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:51,860
Um,
I think it would still.

3302
02:38:52,540 --> 02:38:54,950
There's this question of just why do we 
care about democracy?

3303
02:38:54,951 --> 02:38:59,951
What's the point?
Why do we seems like a really important 

3304
02:39:00,230 --> 02:39:00,890
thing?
Oh yeah.

3305
02:39:00,891 --> 02:39:03,020
Political philosophers talk about this 
all the time.

3306
02:39:03,050 --> 02:39:06,260
So they kind of agreed like democracy 
seems goods,

3307
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:09,920
other forms of government that we know 
so far seem terrible,

3308
02:39:10,450 --> 02:39:11,240
terrible,
or worse.

3309
02:39:11,390 --> 02:39:13,100
But why?
Why is democracy good?

3310
02:39:13,550 --> 02:39:18,550
Is it just that democracy gives us this 
way to boot out dictators and the risk 

3311
02:39:19,161 --> 02:39:22,010
of a single person taking power is just 
really,

3312
02:39:22,011 --> 02:39:25,100
really bad and so we just need some 
mechanism to get rid of that.

3313
02:39:25,670 --> 02:39:30,670
Is that it's intrinsically valuable?
Is it that people just have a right to 

3314
02:39:30,670 --> 02:39:33,950
have equal representation and that's 
just this fundamental thing?

3315
02:39:34,490 --> 02:39:38,000
Or is it justified on just in terms of 
the consequences?

3316
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:43,240
Is it because if everybody's able to 
contribute then people will make better 

3317
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:44,510
decisions?
I never necessarily think it's an either

3318
02:39:44,511 --> 02:39:49,511
or.
I think there's also the people like to 

3319
02:39:49,511 --> 02:39:51,491
feel like they play a part,
like they don't want to feel like 

3320
02:39:51,491 --> 02:39:51,491
they're being ruled over by some 
monarch.

3321
02:39:51,491 --> 02:39:54,740
They want to feel like they have some 
sort of a play and the decision making.

3322
02:39:55,020 --> 02:40:00,020
It's also what one of the gross things 
about trump winning in this country is 

3323
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:03,101
how many people gloated you know,
how many people gloat upon victory that 

3324
02:40:03,101 --> 02:40:07,151
their side one and then you're dealing 
with this whole team mentality that 

3325
02:40:07,151 --> 02:40:08,630
people adopt when it comes to any sort 
of an issue.

3326
02:40:08,910 --> 02:40:10,500
Well,
I mean this is cool,

3327
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:11,170
right?
Right.

3328
02:40:11,540 --> 02:40:11,930
Yeah,
no,

3329
02:40:11,931 --> 02:40:16,931
in general,
this is one of the things I'm really 

3330
02:40:16,931 --> 02:40:16,931
worried

3331
02:40:16,931 --> 02:40:16,931
about with,
um,

3332
02:40:16,931 --> 02:40:18,190
uh,
um,

3333
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:23,240
is increasing levels of partisanship.
This is just this really robust 

3334
02:40:23,240 --> 02:40:23,390
phenomenon that we're seeing.
Um,

3335
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:28,640
and it's really worrying because it 
means that we're just undermining any 

3336
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:28,640
chance of people changing their mind.
Like someone,

3337
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:30,290
like people say,
well,

3338
02:40:30,291 --> 02:40:35,291
it costs a commie accepted,
but like the vast majority of votes 

3339
02:40:35,291 --> 02:40:38,871
were.
And similarly for Hillary's votes were 

3340
02:40:38,871 --> 02:40:38,940
from people who just always voted 
Republican or Democrat.

3341
02:40:39,480 --> 02:40:40,640
Well,
not necessarily

3342
02:40:40,650 --> 02:40:45,150
because the trump won by so many votes 
that have good percentage of them had to

3343
02:40:45,151 --> 02:40:47,760
have voted for Obama.
Just statistically,

3344
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:48,540
oh,
I'm,

3345
02:40:48,700 --> 02:40:53,700
I'm still thinking of thumps votes.
What proportion of people have only ever

3346
02:40:57,661 --> 02:40:59,310
voted Republican?
It's a good question.

3347
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:03,720
And I would like definitely bet greater 
than 80 percent negative.

3348
02:41:03,721 --> 02:41:04,440
Ninety percent.
Yeah,

3349
02:41:04,441 --> 02:41:06,450
that's what I mean.
If you look at the polls,

3350
02:41:06,451 --> 02:41:10,640
like it's always that in terms of 
expected number of votes,

3351
02:41:10,650 --> 02:41:10,860
like,
oh,

3352
02:41:10,861 --> 02:41:13,730
it's only 46 percent in favor trump with
his office.

3353
02:41:13,770 --> 02:41:16,260
So the issue that the independence and 
the swing states,

3354
02:41:16,290 --> 02:41:19,860
whether it's Gary Johnson or whether 
it's Jill Stein,

3355
02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:25,130
those independence,
the amount of votes they got would have 

3356
02:41:25,130 --> 02:41:25,840
swung the other way towards Hillary.
Yeah.

3357
02:41:25,930 --> 02:41:28,510
I remember looking into this for Jill 
Stein in particular,

3358
02:41:28,810 --> 02:41:32,710
and actually it was the case she would 
have won the popular vote by even more,

3359
02:41:32,950 --> 02:41:36,130
but in none of the swing states,
did she get enough of a percentage,

3360
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:38,480
not just Jill Stein or Gary Johnson as 
well?

3361
02:41:38,550 --> 02:41:39,600
Yeah,
though Gary Johnson,

3362
02:41:39,601 --> 02:41:44,430
it seemed to me was split almost evenly 
between trump and hillary.

3363
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:48,930
But this is an interesting case.
So the thing that people.

3364
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:51,120
Yeah,
I don't think about so much as like,

3365
02:41:51,150 --> 02:41:53,940
I think the process,
we all the sudden like a democracy,

3366
02:41:53,941 --> 02:41:58,941
but like one single,
I'm like check box every four years.

3367
02:41:59,731 --> 02:42:04,731
It's like the smallest amount of 
information you can be getting and it's 

3368
02:42:04,731 --> 02:42:05,940
susceptible to all sorts of different 
things.

3369
02:42:05,941 --> 02:42:08,240
So it's opposing.
And this happens on both sides.

3370
02:42:08,250 --> 02:42:09,810
It's opposing.
Jill Stein became,

3371
02:42:09,950 --> 02:42:10,890
you know,
really,

3372
02:42:10,891 --> 02:42:13,500
um,
a really popular,

3373
02:42:13,530 --> 02:42:18,530
took 10 percent of the vote.
She would've just killed hillary like 

3374
02:42:18,530 --> 02:42:20,940
absolutely or suppose.
And the Evan Mcmullin,

3375
02:42:20,970 --> 02:42:22,870
is that his name?
Yeah,

3376
02:42:22,890 --> 02:42:25,370
he was a Publican Independent.
Okay.

3377
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:29,390
Did well in Utah and it was supposedly a
far right candidate.

3378
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:30,520
It does really well.
Again,

3379
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:32,990
takes all of the votes away from,
from um,

3380
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:38,480
the fact that that's possible.
Shows that like first past the post 

3381
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:39,000
voting system is a very bad voting 
system,

3382
02:42:39,220 --> 02:42:44,220
is not accurately representing the will 
of the people and we could do so much 

3383
02:42:44,220 --> 02:42:48,381
better than it would mean that I'm like 
as a democratic process,

3384
02:42:48,421 --> 02:42:53,421
you'd be much closer to that.
Presenting what people actually believe 

3385
02:42:53,421 --> 02:42:56,010
or feel about things because right now 
it means that yeah,

3386
02:42:56,011 --> 02:43:01,011
you can be influenced by stuff.
Like how much support as a third party 

3387
02:43:01,011 --> 02:43:01,011
get.
Well

3388
02:43:01,011 --> 02:43:02,600
System's terrible system.
It lasts too long.

3389
02:43:02,601 --> 02:43:07,601
The decisions last for four years.
This person gets locked into position 

3390
02:43:07,601 --> 02:43:08,600
unless you impeach them and then remove 
them from office.

3391
02:43:08,601 --> 02:43:10,100
They're stuck.
It sucks.

3392
02:43:10,101 --> 02:43:11,890
I wish I could talk about more,
but I can't.

3393
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:12,110
I gotta

3394
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:14,070
get the Fuck Outta here.
But uh,

3395
02:43:14,110 --> 02:43:19,110
this,
that's the least interesting thing we 

3396
02:43:19,110 --> 02:43:21,091
talked about today.
But the ai and all the other stuff is 

3397
02:43:21,091 --> 02:43:24,280
just fascinating stuff.
If people want to know more about your,

3398
02:43:24,480 --> 02:43:29,480
uh,
effective altruism movement and more 

3399
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:29,480
about you,
where should they go?

3400
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:30,130
They should go to effective 
altruism.org.

3401
02:43:30,350 --> 02:43:35,350
Um,
that's got tons of information about 

3402
02:43:35,350 --> 02:43:37,051
effective altruism if you want to,
if there's one takeaway that you 

3403
02:43:37,051 --> 02:43:37,051
literally want to do,
you think,

3404
02:43:37,051 --> 02:43:37,210
wow,
actually this was kind of cool.

3405
02:43:37,211 --> 02:43:41,620
I do want to make more of a difference.
We've just launched a set of funds so it

3406
02:43:41,621 --> 02:43:43,420
just means you can donate within one of 
these,

3407
02:43:43,421 --> 02:43:48,421
cause that is a global development,
animal welfare or preservation of the 

3408
02:43:48,421 --> 02:43:51,010
long run future against global 
catastrophic risks.

3409
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:53,930
You can just donate and have ensure that
we'll go to the vet.

3410
02:43:53,931 --> 02:43:58,150
He most effective nonprofits,
zero percent overheads depending how you

3411
02:43:58,151 --> 02:43:59,920
tonight.
And I'm like,

3412
02:43:59,921 --> 02:44:02,860
we don't take any money along the way 
and just means that,

3413
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:08,040
yeah,
super easy to donate as effectively as 

3414
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:08,040
possible.
All right,

3415
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:08,040
beautiful.
Thank you.

3416
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:09,720
Well appreciate.
It was really fun.

3417
02:44:09,850 --> 02:44:11,960
We'll be back tomorrow with Jim Norton 
Seal.

3418
02:44:12,360 --> 02:44:12,510
Yeah.
