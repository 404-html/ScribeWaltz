1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,610
The Joe Rogan experience the cards.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,870
Did you ever have a comedy card?

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,441
No,

4
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:05,010
never had it.

5
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,010
We had a card once to promote a website
that I put out to promote my website,

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,140
but there was never one for like,

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,910
like I'm appearing in this town like
with like pointing to the right and the

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,763
big.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,931
Someone told me,

10
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,190
what am I coming to you?

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,140
Someone told me that my track record
is this and then I'll tell you what

12
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:28,711
somebody told me,

13
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:29,550
George Carlin said,

14
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,650
but at least I wish I could
have said I never had a card.

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,250
But I am proud to say if I'm
going to be 100 percent honest.

16
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:37,950
I had one for like a month and then
I just didn't like the smell of it.

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,440
So I got rid of it.

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,260
No tagless comedian.

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,750
I was like,

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,110
Shit.

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,840
I think I saw some other
comedian with a car and I'm like,

22
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:46,710
I should have caught it.

23
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,300
And then I got rid of him.

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,670
So now I'm glad because
someone said somebody at the.

25
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,440
George Carlin was talking about cards
backstage at the comedy magic club and

26
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,274
basically said,

27
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,030
he goes,

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,390
you know,

29
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,270
the comedian doesn't have a fucking card,

30
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,090
you know,

31
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,300
and then the comedian that had the guard
sort of felt like he took them very

32
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:06,930
quickly over to the truck
because he had just gotten cards.

33
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,071
Yeah,

34
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:08,510
that's.

35
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,280
That was a thing about
head shots back in Boston.

36
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,830
Anybody who's any good
had the shitty headshot,

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,090
they didn't give a fuck about their
head and you can see that same,

38
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,680
that same path.

39
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,090
They would talk about it like if you
hire a photographer to do your headshot,

40
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,440
you fucking suck on stage.

41
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,373
Would always say that.

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,040
That was just such an unspoken.

43
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,110
Are there exceptions?

44
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,481
Yes,

45
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,130
but no.

46
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,060
Mostly that such a great.

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,350
Well this something that makes you want
to take a picture of yourself and be all

48
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:38,160
sexy looking.

49
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,330
That's Uber.

50
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,780
Douchey doesn't translate into comedy.

51
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,913
You know,

52
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,750
there's some guys are good ham it up.

53
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,270
Like I remember Kevin Knox
had like a really Zany,

54
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,350
like head shot,

55
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,660
but it worked for him because
that was like his act,

56
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:54,630
like he was a wild energetic guy.

57
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,720
What if I talk about how bad
that is and I agree with you,

58
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:58,860
but then you guys pull online.

59
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,830
A picture of me with my shoe is a phone

60
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,211
picture of you.

61
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:03,401
I like.

62
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:03,630
Oh,

63
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,040
that with the shoe?

64
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,240
Yeah.

65
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
It was like it was a phone.

66
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,260
Nobody did that then?

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,480
No,

68
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,460
it was really the first.

69
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,780
I thought it was real for sure.

70
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,770
When I was a kid I was like,

71
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,150
they sat it on TV.

72
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,180
They said it's a big foot.

73
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,070
The guy got a big foot,

74
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,151
but then when you watch it,

75
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:20,151
like slowed down and then enhanced and
then you look at how little detail you're

76
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,084
really seeing.

77
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,010
Like everything's all flush.

78
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,720
Like everything's like bright,

79
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,070
like the leaves and trees.

80
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:27,120
It's almost white,

81
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:28,500
like there's no detail at all.

82
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,760
So you pretending that you see all
this detail in this monkey suits,

83
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,500
but ignoring the fact that you
can't see the fucking trees,

84
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,430
you know,

85
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,121
where's he going?

86
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,500
He's very nonchalant about it too.

87
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,690
It's a girl supposedly.

88
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,350
Oh,

89
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,220
where's she going?

90
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,920
She's going to go get some dicks.

91
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,930
It's often a lot of big floods.

92
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,460
Kind of nonchalant,

93
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:47,731
like,

94
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:47,911
oh,

95
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:48,760
I got spotted,

96
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:48,971
okay,

97
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:49,880
I'm off the lunch.

98
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,210
Like,

99
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,810
you know,

100
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,700
there's no real purpose
to look at this thing

101
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,620
to me is like there's like some moments
where she picks her feet up or it or he,

102
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,220
Bob Hieronymus Bosch and
the bottom of the feet.

103
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,750
It's fucking worn.

104
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,700
Big Feet,

105
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,900
big rubber feet like that.

106
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:12,040
You got to really throw your legs up
higher and it's definitely apparent and

107
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,710
that was one of the things that
they said that the gate was off.

108
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,700
It was hilarious.

109
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,180
I was talking to this expert when I was
doing the Scifi show who was arguing to

110
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,410
death with me about this.

111
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,260
He was like the average
gait of a human being.

112
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,940
It's not like it was like nine degrees,

113
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,770
but the big foot is like 25 degrees.

114
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,161
I go,

115
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:27,311
oh,

116
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,690
you mean he would have had to do this?

117
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,160
And then I started walking
around like big flood.

118
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:30,371
I'm like,

119
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,420
what the fuck man?

120
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,250
Like you're supposed to be a scientist.

121
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,450
Like you're crazy.

122
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,680
That's a guy in a suit.

123
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:36,514
But it's like a,

124
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,530
it's a crypto zoological.

125
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:39,364
Jesus.

126
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,430
Like you're not supposed to fuck
with the Patterson Gimlin footage.

127
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,900
They all believe it.

128
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,430
I have not talked to one of those dudes
who are like crazy big foot fanatics who

129
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,264
think it's a hoax.

130
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,750
Fucking believe I got so high once,

131
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,100
I believe for 15 whole minutes.

132
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,850
I thought for a second and we were at
the Ice House and we're doing a comedy

133
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:01,270
show and then we start talking shit and
we played the footage and we were so

134
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:01,661
baked.

135
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,040
I was looking at the video and I was like,

136
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:03,971
oh my God,

137
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,100
what if it's real and I'm just an asshole?

138
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,570
What if it's real?

139
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,100
And this whole time I've been denying
like the greatest discovery in crypto

140
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:14,830
zoological history and
I'm just being a dick,

141
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,000
but then I sobered up.

142
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,120
Well,

143
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,420
you know,

144
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,280
it's like wanting to,

145
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:18,731
you know,

146
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,080
believe in real monsters.

147
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:20,560
I mean,

148
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,210
the lochness monster is another one.

149
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:22,630
I mean,

150
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,640
every culture has won.

151
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,970
The lochness monster has got to be the
biggest pussy of all time because he

152
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:29,170
never kills anybody.

153
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,790
How do you get to be a monster?

154
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,211
It's icon,

155
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:31,611
a whale,

156
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:35,620
and may just become missing people
because they're taken under the water.

157
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,670
Your opinion though,

158
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,810
at your expert opinion,

159
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:38,320
what is that?

160
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,831
What's what?

161
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,320
What are we looking at
for the paterson footage?

162
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,423
Just for the record,

163
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,800
what are we looking at man in a suit?

164
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,723
A man in a suit?

165
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,310
Yeah,

166
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,931
hundred percent,

167
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:47,764
right?

168
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,270
Ninety nine percent.

169
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,170
Jesus Christ.

170
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,880
He's a fucking special effects expert.

171
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,800
And these knuckleheads like of ways that
the legs move that you just can't do

172
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:01,801
what the human frame they want to
convince themselves so bad that a con man

173
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,640
figured out how to find bigfoot
and did it in like a day.

174
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,750
Lighting is your new book and um,

175
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,980
what it's a,

176
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,780
there's a really important thing that you,

177
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:17,050
uh,

178
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,883
you bring up.

179
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,500
It's not on the front part of this.

180
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,620
I've read it online somewhere that you
can avoid a lot of problems in your life.

181
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,161
Yeah.

182
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:27,460
Yeah.

183
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,540
Simply by not lying.

184
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,380
Almost.

185
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,250
Almost all of them.

186
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Of all the ones that are avoidable.

187
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,563
Yeah.

188
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,040
When you just look at how people
screw up their lives line is.

189
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,170
If it's not the reason,

190
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,810
it's the thing that
enabled the other reason.

191
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,940
I mean people complicate their lives
massively by a willingness to deceive

192
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:55,240
others and this has many features to it.

193
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:56,500
One is just there,

194
00:05:56,501 --> 00:06:01,501
all the things you can do based on
the cover that lies provide that you

195
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:07,400
shouldn't be doing because
they're not good for you and now,

196
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,550
and everyone would hate you if they
knew you were doing them or your,

197
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:09,701
you know,

198
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,000
your wife would leave you or whatever,

199
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,863
whatever it is.

200
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,850
And so the law,

201
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,610
the lies,

202
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,390
lies create a space in which you
can let your life run off the whale,

203
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,741
run off the rails,

204
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,840
whether it's becoming
an addict or with a or,

205
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,591
or,

206
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,424
um,

207
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,030
uh,

208
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,630
you know,

209
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,730
perpetrating financial
frauds or whatever it is.

210
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,650
Uh,

211
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,230
uh,

212
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,900
but there's,

213
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,190
there's also this component
where you don't actually,

214
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:36,191
you never actually discover who you
are in social space if you always leave

215
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,690
yourself this out of line.

216
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,900
So it's like you never discovered that
if you keep canceling plans with people

217
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,400
and just tell this white lie that you're
too busy or you're not feeling well,

218
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:50,150
or is that you never have to confront
the fact that these are people you

219
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:54,380
actually don't want to see people in your
life who want to go out to dinner with

220
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,070
you.

221
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,330
You don't want to see them and you're
never having to confront that because you

222
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,190
have this out that you're just gonna lie.

223
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:01,920
You know?

224
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,330
And,

225
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,740
and there's just,

226
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,053
if you want,

227
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,740
there's actually no change in a person's
life that I think is more important in

228
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,430
terms of getting your life straight,

229
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,810
your,

230
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,380
your to ship straight.

231
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:20,060
You're just getting into the future
without screwing it up for yourself.

232
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,670
There's no more important change than,

233
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,150
than a commitment to being honest in,

234
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,870
in whatever the situation is.

235
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:27,704
That presents itself.

236
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,120
When I was a freshman at Stanford,

237
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,810
I took a course with a
professor who actually interview
in the back of the book.

238
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,970
I'm Ronald Howard,

239
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:39,971
who is a really brilliant guy who started
a whole academic field called decision

240
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:42,110
analysis and the sixties,

241
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:42,381
and it's,

242
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,214
it's a,

243
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,920
it's a mechanism which

244
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,810
allows someone to make as
rational decision as possible
by putting all of their

245
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,970
information about a topic into,

246
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,893
into a,

247
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,280
essentially a calculation.

248
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,390
Um,

249
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,350
it's got nothing to do with,

250
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:00,681
with,

251
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:00,891
uh,

252
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:02,510
with line or honesty,

253
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:02,900
but he's a,

254
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,500
he's a,

255
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,090
a,

256
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,420
a professor in the engineering economic
systems department's efforts and he as

257
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,070
kind of a sideline to his,

258
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,320
his academic work was teaching these,

259
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,350
these courses on ethics and one course
was just on the question whether it's

260
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:19,220
ever ethical to lie.

261
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,840
And so as a freshman I was just sort of
put in the machine of this course and

262
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:24,920
came out the other side,

263
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,790
convinced that in virtually any situation,

264
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,580
apart from like a self defense
situation where you would,

265
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,700
where things have really broken down and
you're not in the presence of someone

266
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:38,060
who you're going to collaborate
with line is just unacceptable.

267
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:38,690
It's just not,

268
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,040
it's not how I want to live.

269
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,400
It's not how anyone should want to live.

270
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:44,690
If they look at it closely enough.
