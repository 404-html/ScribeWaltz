1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,100
It was a thing on our
reality sandwich worked.

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,020
I was criticizing the salt stoned ape
theory and it was only based on one point,

3
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:17,240
the visual acuity point.

4
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:22,241
They were arguing about Roland Fischer's
work on visual acuity being measurably

5
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:25,000
improved by who knows?

6
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:25,860
You could try that.

7
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:26,521
I looked that up.

8
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:27,420
I can find that study.

9
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:27,560
Yeah,

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,470
I didn't find it either.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,521
Maybe that's wrong,

12
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:32,420
but it's still like to chart harp on one.

13
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:32,610
Okay.

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,830
Fairly insignificant
portion of the theory.

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,900
The theory never made
sense to me in that regard.

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,291
The,

17
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,490
the visual acuity thing,

18
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,050
because that's in low doses.

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,741
That's what you're saying.

20
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:41,970
But they're not eating low doses.

21
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:43,190
They're eating a lot of that shit.

22
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,030
Why low doses if they could find it,

23
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:45,660
you know,

24
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:45,841
they're,

25
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,250
they're eating probably tons of it.

26
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,420
We talked to,

27
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,420
we talked to our primatologists about
it and he said that the time period that

28
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:57,540
Mckenna has using does not work
for the way he understands,

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,050
uh,

30
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,883
climate,

31
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,970
the growth of the neo cortex
and predominance apparently.

32
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,133
Um,

33
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,560
so his theory about the massive
expansion of our brains,

34
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:08,180
right.

35
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,180
Did it happen way before Mckenna says the
stoned ape theory or what's happening.

36
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:17,140
But then he might've been confused
about that time period cause they,

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,870
I believe Macanta mine at candidate
know Mckenna says that early plasticine

38
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:22,561
error I think.

39
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,220
And like,

40
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,470
sorry,

41
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,180
I don't know.

42
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,570
Well the theory for the folks who
don't know what the fuck are they is,

43
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:31,160
the theory is that at one point in time
monkeys climb down from the trees and

44
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:34,760
they were experimenting with new food
sources and they started eating suicide as

45
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,270
mushrooms because there was these great
herds of Unpeel it cattle that were,

46
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:38,450
you know,

47
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,140
hooked cattle that are wandering around
the fields dropping shits and that these

48
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:43,880
mushrooms grow from these shits and these,

49
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,391
these,

50
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:44,720
uh,

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,820
monkeys and baboons have been dead.

52
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,330
They've demonstrated them lifting up cow
patties and looking for bugs and stuff

53
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:52,140
on that you think cause
it's all moist and,

54
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,730
and that eating these
mushrooms that grew on these,

55
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,970
these cow shits made them more,

56
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,530
more evolved and made them,

57
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:00,890
uh,

58
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,420
like doubled the size of the human
brain may have them develop language.

59
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,980
Yeah.

60
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,813
Yeah.

61
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,683
Look,

62
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,620
something happened.

63
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,250
Sure.

64
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:10,671
Look at us.

65
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,271
And look at them.

66
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,230
It's pretty fucking clear.

67
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,640
Is that a big Goddamn gap?

68
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,001
Why?

69
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,930
What is this gap?

70
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,043
I know.

71
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,590
I really think it's that crazy,

72
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:19,670
a crazy idea and you know,

73
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,100
most people I talk to you,

74
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:21,580
they were,

75
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,920
their main response
scientists gave was like,

76
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,260
you know you need a time machine.

77
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,590
It really proved that theory.

78
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:27,424
So yeah,

79
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,600
don't get your eyes.

80
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,950
See this gentleman,

81
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,160
one of the greatest podcast cast,

82
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:32,994
if not the greatest

83
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,580
all time flows.

84
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,460
I don't have an ax.

85
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,030
Okay.

86
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,630
That's the problem I was worried about.

87
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,200
I am sure I was worried about
you being a little too trendy.

88
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,310
It's fun cop breath stretching.

89
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,841
You don't have that ordered.

90
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,480
I worked out with Steve
Maxwell and Toronto and I
ordered an Indian club bells.

91
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,690
There were this big iron
baseball bats and you're like,

92
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,023
oh

93
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,861
the barely do it.

94
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:07,431
10 pounds,

95
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:07,551
man.

96
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:08,061
It's crazy.

97
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:09,080
It's a crazy exercise.

98
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,240
So I ordered these 15 pounders and
I'm going to build up to 45 pounders.

99
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,810
That's when you're a fucking real ox.

100
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,310
When you're a real animal and
you want to put the squeezed off.

101
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,920
No,

102
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,780
I've been out for almost two months now.

103
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:21,614
The back injury?

104
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,301
Yeah.

105
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:26,540
I had a reoccurring thing where
I would pop out a rib head.

106
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,090
So what I decided to do is
just work out a lot of it,

107
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:29,990
do a lot of cardio,

108
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:31,280
a lot of hitting the bag and stuff.

109
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,470
Actually I got leaner and um,

110
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,010
uh,

111
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,760
less uh,

112
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,860
less rolling and more like high
rep kettlebell stuff and a lot,

113
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,160
a lot of like different strength
and conditioning shit cause I,

114
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,590
this,

115
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,810
this injury kept happening.

116
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:45,320
It can't,

117
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,600
I,

118
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,440
it happened over a course of a few months
over and over again in the same spot.

119
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:48,981
I was like,

120
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:49,190
all right,

121
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,971
I need to get in this thing.

122
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:52,040
Some actual real time off
or it's going to be crying.

123
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,950
You got no guy like you and your physique.

124
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:56,550
You don't really have to worry
about that crest scratch.

125
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,393
We'll have

126
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,140
the um,

127
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,470
the dance dance or video
you did and it was,

128
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,304
it called,

129
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,483
oh Steve,

130
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,330
what the fuck?

131
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,120
There's a self defense vouch with crepey.

132
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,071
You had no,

133
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:13,904
you hadn't like,

134
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,763
uh,

135
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,673
fuck,

136
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,010
not unintentional unintentional dancer.

137
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,760
You had a sketch.

138
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,593
The Creator,

139
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,860
was it called?

140
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,630
Oh yeah,

141
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,220
I was,

142
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,900
I've buck on and on.

143
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,030
It's not unintentional orthodox stance.

144
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:27,971
Answer.

145
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:28,470
Yes.

146
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:28,650
Well,

147
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,483
it was that.

148
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,470
I just did the weirdest shit where I'd
show up in like underwear and get mask.

149
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,250
I had one of those Bob's
thing and I just come it,

150
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,330
Bam and I hit it and go run and go,

151
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:40,730
hey,

152
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,563
that's some shit.

153
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,480
He was like the most
absurd shit that ever done.

154
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,353
He's helped me.

155
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,410
I think I might have it in my trunk.

156
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,220
I might.

157
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,920
He gave me a DVD.

158
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:49,151
We were,

159
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:49,930
we were hanging out.

160
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,600
He goes,

161
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,210
this thing has fucking thing.

162
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,021
I did this.

163
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,854
Go check this out.

164
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,933
Tell me like it.

165
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,290
I get home.

166
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,130
I just talking about computer to run.

167
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,110
The fuck is wrong with this deal.

168
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,893
I get such a good

169
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,230
pink socks and shit

170
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,420
fly by but then run away.

171
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,540
That was so fucking retarded.

172
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,680
Alex Jones,

173
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,390
the Joey d is on the Alex Jones show.

174
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,290
Have you ever seen that?

175
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,880
For those who haven't seen it,

176
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:19,290
so we might as well
just stick this in here,

177
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,640
put it in or you got to see this.

178
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:20,860
Well,

179
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,780
we'll edit it in here.

180
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,120
This is the funniest
thing that I've already,

181
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,140
so there's a segment off of the uh,

182
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:25,974
Austin,

183
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,690
uh,

184
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,880
video that Brian made when we
went to Austin with little year.

185
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,180
Funniest thing that I've ever seen
in my life were in doom and gloom.

186
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:34,110
Alex Jones,

187
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:34,580
no

188
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,740
black helicopters and aliens.

189
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,610
The government,

190
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,840
the CIA.

191
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,600
Eugenics is a master race.

192
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:42,440
It's that layer.

193
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,250
He's all crazy like this.

194
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:47,970
And Joey dance comes in with a story
about some my little weed under his balls

195
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,370
and Alex is trying to stop
him from saying on the air,

196
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,900
but Joey just runs with it.

197
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:55,140
And it is the single most powerful
performance you've ever seen in your life.

198
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,160
The commitment he has on a
fucking national right way,

199
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,780
not right wing sort of libertarian,

200
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:01,820
crazy apocalyptic radio show.

201
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,020
This guy wants to talk about,

202
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,380
we ain't go ablations,

203
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:04,760
gentlemen.

204
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,181
Right now.

205
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:10,181
The price of gold is down all time lows
and the neo cons for starting this up.

206
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,020
No,

207
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,080
he'll tell you about fucking,

208
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,640
and he'll sell you for freeze dried
food that you keep on going because it

209
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,640
survives nuclear war.

210
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,690
It's in special aluminum cans and Joanie
is talking about smuggling weed under

211
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:23,180
his balls and it's the funniest fucking
thing I've ever seen in my life.

212
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,500
It's a humbling can I?

213
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,353
Where can I get it?

214
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,480
It's not book.

215
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,650
Put It on this and we'll say like,

216
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,633
I got to see that.

217
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,081
Boom.

218
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:29,914
Schelok log.

219
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,480
I hadn't heard back yet.

220
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,500
I put into my left side.

221
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
We're not telling the story

222
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,810
whole bottle right now.

223
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,990
This is freedom.

224
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,290
This is not a control.

225
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,930
There's hope thumping joints worse.

226
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,160
Hold on.

227
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,940
He is worse than problem.

228
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,731
I love him.

229
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:54,010
But y'all bring this monster

230
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,730
so

231
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,280
you know if people are looking for the
truth on this show is about the truth.

232
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,423
I I,

233
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,280
I got debt and I had baggy clothes on but
I had a belt on and they sound because

234
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,210
you have baggy clothes on.

235
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:11,840
They didn't know as well.

236
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,680
Spray pounds.

237
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,690
They said we're going to put
you to the x ray machine.

238
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,870
I'm standing there sweating bullets with
this baggy under my fucking God left us

239
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,990
bigger than the right regular
cause I'm a righty stop.

240
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:22,671
People don't know that.

241
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,050
I thought I had cancer for couple weeks.

242
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,520
You know the opposite hand.

243
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,090
When my legs open it,

244
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,840
you're like Rodney Dangerfield said,

245
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,970
stop talking about that was sticking
up a storm and not to make it my boss.

246
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,103
I'm sweating,

247
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,573
but I

248
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,733
shook my hand.

249
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,110
I'm like,

250
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,410
Mike,

251
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,520
payers are hard at work.

252
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,111
Don't know.

253
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:46,944
I know.

254
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:47,991
Go Fuck Yourself.

255
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:48,621
You come on.

256
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:49,470
Hold on one second.

257
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,643
Joey Diaz.

258
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,520
Facebook,

259
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,060
Twitter.

260
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,040
Check yourself before you wreck yourself.

261
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,851
Big Dixon.

262
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,684
Yes.

263
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,970
They black cause that's
the most important.

264
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,141
Ah,

265
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:05,520
okay.

266
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,353
Okay.

267
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,960
Tell us for a while been talking

268
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,040
old school comedy store veteran.

269
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,980
Steven is easy.

270
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,630
I know Steve Forever.

271
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Back in the day.

272
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,123
Oh,

273
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,103
California.

274
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,530
You guys have the same car.

275
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:31,020
Did you?

276
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,430
Gay Lords I bought a couple of weeks ago.

277
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,453
What'd he say?

278
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,680
Let's explore.

279
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,161
Oh,

280
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:36,970
that's an explorer.

281
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,190
But they're both for the new
explorers is supposed to be a shit.

282
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,100
Fords or a spaceship.

283
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,420
Yeah.

284
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,070
Touch everything.

285
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,840
I put my,

286
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,551
I hit a button,

287
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,380
I go drive home.

288
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,000
Really driving home.

289
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,170
Matt fucking whole thing to call
Joe Rogan because Joe Rogan.

290
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,220
What the air to 75 75

291
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,830
wow.

292
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah,

293
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,720
it's crazy.

294
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,590
We're living in the future.

295
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,371
That's it guys.

296
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,204
It's really going down.

297
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,140
That's right.

298
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,501
So,

299
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,334
uh,

300
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,180
um,

301
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,751
have you,

302
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,050
uh,

303
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,580
ever thought about doing your own podcast?

304
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,573
No.

305
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,321
You know what it is.

306
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,430
I have fun doing other people.

307
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,230
I've only done yours twice.

308
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:13,590
I didn't Marin's I did Ari's
did you like doing marathons?

309
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,570
I did like doing married.

310
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,510
I did a really early,

311
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,190
I did it like probably when he,

312
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,900
I don't think he would
ask me to do it now.

313
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,940
I did it when he was still like,

314
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,920
he's kind of a bunch
of scrubs on that show.

315
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,283
Who would let you on?

316
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,253
Thank you.

317
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,280
You wouldn't be the only one
that's going to fucking listed,

318
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,640
but way more advanced
here on the actual show.

319
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,420
But it's uh,

320
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,100
I enjoy doing them.

321
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,210
I don't really know.

322
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,280
I don't really,

323
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,820
I know it's like,

324
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,031
I like,

325
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:39,510
I like hanging out with my friends.

326
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:42,070
It's an awesome tool for
pumping up shows though,

327
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:42,440
man.

328
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,273
It really is.

329
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,440
People will say to me,

330
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,030
you've got to do Joe Rogan's podcast.

331
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,430
I will.

332
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,263
Yeah.

333
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,450
I want to do Benson's too.

334
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:51,870
Yeah,

335
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,700
this is great too.

336
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,031
But I mean,

337
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:54,620
as far as like for promoting gigs,

338
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:54,841
it's,

339
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:55,910
it makes a huge difference,

340
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:56,110
man.

341
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,943
If you had your own,

342
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,070
you would really developed,

343
00:09:58,071 --> 00:09:59,540
do you have like a serious website?

344
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,591
Not really.

345
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:01,580
Now give him a message board.

346
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,450
No.

347
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,940
You should get those yeses.

348
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,190
Yeah.

349
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,581
Yeah.

350
00:10:04,581 --> 00:10:05,930
You develop a little community,

351
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:06,141
man.

352
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:08,690
I got a message board that has
almost 4 million posts on it,

353
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,531
more than 4 million.

354
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:10,220
Right?

355
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,420
4 million posts on it.

356
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,020
All these members and you can communicate
back and forth with these people.

357
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:15,854
So easy.

358
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,250
You could promote gig.

359
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,084
So easy.

360
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,591
I mean,

361
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:20,930
it's not like anything in the past.

362
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,700
They're your access to your fans.

363
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,700
It's like directly did I feel I
answered tweets and I answered like the

364
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:31,590
intelligent ones and then
Facebook messages and stuff
and then some stuff on my

365
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:32,100
website.

366
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,030
But yeah,

367
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:33,420
I dunno.

368
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,670
Maybe I've never been good
at the marketing side.

369
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,301
Yeah,

370
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,190
but this is the best way because it's fun.

371
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,930
Everything else we've done,

372
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,290
it's like,

373
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:40,561
wow,

374
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:42,520
I've got to fucking
promote on [inaudible].

375
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,650
Gotta do this.

376
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:44,484
You've got to do that.

377
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,320
Everything else has been like work,

378
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,210
but this does not seem like work at all.

379
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,290
This is like fun stuff.

380
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:50,550
Yeah,

381
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,001
we should do it,

382
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:51,690
man.

383
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,230
See rosacea.

384
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,063
You can do it with Brian.

385
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:53,960
Brian Red Bat.

386
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,430
It's Ryan has its own broadcast network.

387
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:56,671
Dude.

388
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,670
He could immediately get you seen
by hundreds of thousands of people.

389
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,340
Do you have to have an angle?

390
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,180
You have to have an angle.

391
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,470
You can just go get we did today.

392
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,880
We didn't talk about what we're going to
do and I don't ever talk about what I'm

393
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:07,181
going to do.

394
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:09,190
I mean every now and then someone
will be talking about some shit in the

395
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:09,461
kitchen.

396
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:09,680
I'm like,

397
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,001
save it,

398
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:10,301
save it,

399
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:10,590
save it.

400
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,130
Yeah.

401
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,963
No.

402
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,581
Cool.

403
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:13,414
That's all I got

404
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,470
here we are alive and Sunny
California with the movie.

405
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,521
Super High.

406
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:26,390
Me Star

407
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,740
giving way to describe me.

408
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:30,910
That's you dude.

409
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,241
I like,

410
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:36,241
is it like wandering around this life
known everywhere you go as not just a

411
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:38,380
stoner but a super stoner?

412
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,870
It's pretty great.

413
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,131
It's fun.

414
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:42,461
You know,

415
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:43,540
most people leave me alone,

416
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,200
but you know,

417
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,240
the people that know,

418
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,901
they're,

419
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:47,210
uh,

420
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,610
they're usually pretty friendly about it.

421
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:49,030
You get,

422
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,863
you get it.

423
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:50,810
I'm a,

424
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,640
yeah,

425
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,560
you're another above me as far as light,

426
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:58,450
as far as pacos part goes to me and
started talking to me about fear factor or

427
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,250
UFC.

428
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,400
Yeah,

429
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,233
it's all pot.

430
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,103
We do

431
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,760
lots of podcasts,

432
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,790
listeners and you know,

433
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,550
and my podcast all about movies.

434
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,121
So,

435
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:07,954
uh,

436
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:08,621
you know,

437
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:09,910
people want to talk to you about movies,

438
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,590
so that's a nice change of pace.

439
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,660
Could you live anywhere that didn't have,

440
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:15,190
we'd like California has now,

441
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,420
isn't that like a prerequisite?

442
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:18,640
Like if you thought about moving
to some other parts of the country,

443
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,640
like when I moved to Colorado and one of
the first things I thought I was like,

444
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:21,801
okay,

445
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:23,110
and Colorado's got medical potlucks.

446
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,581
Who was like,

447
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:23,770
they're,

448
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:23,921
oh,

449
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:24,754
it's just like yell.

450
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,593
Perfect.

451
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:25,961
Yeah.

452
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,051
Well,

453
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:29,090
that's the thing is all the places that
I gravitate towards on the road are

454
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,110
either places where the whole state has
medical or a particular city is cooler

455
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,380
than other cities,

456
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:35,891
you know,

457
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:38,590
so like it's more decriminalized
in some places than others.

458
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,850
And those tend to be the same cities.

459
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:41,060
I enjoy performing it.

460
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,741
And you're like,

461
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:42,281
Austin,

462
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:45,940
Texas is a great example of
like some places around there.

463
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:46,774
I'd be in pretty,

464
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,681
you know,

465
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:50,110
I'd have to be pretty
paranoid about my behavior,

466
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,210
but in Austin you can
sort of get away with,

467
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,050
um,

468
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,100
I know you're doing Ann Arbor,

469
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:54,530
Michigan,

470
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,190
right?

471
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,023
I love that place.

472
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,480
Yeah,

473
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,370
that place is awesome.

474
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,020
That's a place where you wouldn't realize,

475
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,030
he would know bash,

476
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,790
bash for years before Michigan.

477
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,840
And the medical,

478
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:09,700
and I think also in was probably the
reason why medical got over the hump and

479
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,600
Michigan because there so into it.

480
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,460
And that one city,

481
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,280
have you ever seen the
four 20 day in Boulder?

482
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,560
Fucking incredible.

483
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,060
They go on the collar on the,

484
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:19,251
uh,

485
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:20,560
University of Colorado.

486
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,360
They go on the campus and everyone
smokes out like the whole campus.

487
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,160
Like there's clouds of smoke.

488
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,671
I'll give,

489
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:28,510
never seen anything black.

490
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,910
A thousands of people
passing joints around.

491
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,110
It's fucking nuts.

492
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,470
Yeah.

493
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,460
If you ever done an amazing,

494
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:33,580
no,

495
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,600
I haven't ever been there.

496
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,070
I'm always off somewhere doing a show
is I get a good crowd on four 20 we need

497
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,160
you and I need to do a fucking show there
next for 20 April 20th in boulder or

498
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,550
don't you do a thing doe commit me on
camera every April 20th thought you'd do a

499
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:49,870
thing where you record a new CD.

500
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,540
That's a,

501
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,371
that's what I tried to do.

502
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:51,581
Yeah.

503
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:56,581
This year I was in Sacramento at such
a great we town and it was fun to do it

504
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:56,860
like,

505
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,071
you know,

506
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:00,550
record a record standing in front of the
Capitol building that they have drawn

507
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:02,680
there on the wall at the
punchline in Sacramento.

508
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,090
So it was pretty fun.

509
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,250
So you already have coming
out later this year.

510
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,690
But that's what I do is every year.

511
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:08,470
Like,

512
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,771
you know,

513
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,930
there's a few cities
I'm considering for a,

514
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:11,231
you know,

515
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:12,070
for next year,

516
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,851
but it's just like,

517
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,661
it's a great knife.

518
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:14,680
We are recording an album.

519
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:16,680
It's a great way for
me to always know you,

520
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:17,514
you know,

521
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,160
people say for 20 to me so much
that it's always top of mine.

522
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:25,540
So like I know that like right now I
know I've got like 11 months to get the,

523
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:25,931
you know,

524
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,170
the next material ready
to go for another album.

525
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,250
And so I'll start ditching the stuff from
this album and replacing it with newer

526
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:33,611
stuff.

527
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:34,840
But you know,

528
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:39,280
it's a whole cycle that I go
through that seems to be working.

529
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,710
So no boulders show bitches.

530
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,791
No,

531
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,500
but I definitely want to boulder event.

532
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,580
I'm definitely working on,

533
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:45,940
um,

534
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,740
I think I'm going to go
do a show in boulder in,

535
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:48,220
in uh,

536
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,620
September because that is a great place
to go and I've never done up there.

537
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,101
I lived there,

538
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,030
but I never ever performed there.

539
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:54,410
I think when I was
living there I was like,

540
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,240
I don't think I should be
doing standup where I live.

541
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,051
It's a little town.

542
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,040
Went a hundred thousand people.

543
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:58,460
Yeah,

544
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,270
they got a couple of,

545
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,710
they've got a couple of little theaters,

546
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,310
a nice sized theaters in downtown boulder.

547
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,140
Awesome,

548
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,930
awesome town.

549
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,860
One of those rare towns,

550
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,040
the guy that said it best to work for
the local paper said it's a working

551
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,730
utopia.

552
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,421
It's one of the few.

553
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:12,080
It's like,

554
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,711
it's like a weird,

555
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,060
crazy Whoville town,

556
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,923
you know,

557
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,860
it's got the nicest whole
foods I've ever been in.

558
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,880
Foods are usually pretty awesome.

559
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:20,720
So this one's like,

560
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,760
wow to Norris has a
restaurant inside of it.

561
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,120
Yeah.

562
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,331
Yeah,

563
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:23,601
of course.

564
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:24,380
So friendly there.

565
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,210
It's like one of the friendliest
places I've ever been.

566
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,200
And they're all living like an asshole
in this majestic mountain range.

567
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:30,580
I mean,

568
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,570
it's all swollen.

569
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,170
Weed is only thing things going on there.

570
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,490
Yeah,

571
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:33,771
it's cool.

572
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:34,604
And wait,

573
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,923
that's all you need.

574
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,730
Education and marijuana.

575
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:38,450
That's a,

576
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,340
that's going to lead
to a nice place to be.

577
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:40,731
Dot.

578
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:40,991
Benson,

579
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:41,824
ladies and gentlemen,

580
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,370
no wiser words have ever been spoken.

581
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,280
That's pretty much,

582
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,270
it's like wine and cheese.

583
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,370
Now look at it.

584
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,090
Marie.

585
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,923
Look.

586
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,000
Asshole liquid.

587
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,501
Well,

588
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:08,151
let me look at this.

589
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:08,984
And

590
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,290
what do you think that is,

591
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:16,591
Sarah?

592
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:17,281
Well read,

593
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:17,521
man.

594
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:18,540
I thought I liked you.
