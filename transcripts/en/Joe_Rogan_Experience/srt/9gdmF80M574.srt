1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,740
Her low freak bitches.
I trademarked it because I said,

2
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:06,780
you know what it was,
it was starting to like,

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:07,900
you know,
physio when I was like,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,700
I was really passionate about it because
it's something I was saying again.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,020
I didn't have nobody around me,
no.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,910
Used to have friends with me all the
time.

7
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,631
I'm training,
whatever,

8
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:16,770
whatever.
They all left.

9
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:19,050
They was always moved on.
So for me,

10
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,190
I was like,
no entourage,

11
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,530
nobody to push me.
I got to push myself.

12
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:25,020
So I started talking to myself,
something that I ever did.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,870
And that's a whole nother story.
I wanna tell you in the book why I

14
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:31,670
refuse to talk to myself.
Why does your feet tell me?

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,840
I was saving it for book talking,
but I'm still really,

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,240
I'm selling the book,
man.

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,320
Let me know.
Put up links.

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,910
If we go in that route,
then I already know.

19
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:42,900
Come on Doug.
But no,

20
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,000
the reason why is because,
um,

21
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,370
I had an uncle,
my mother's brother Anthony Par Ham.

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,710
He was her only brother.
He went to the military,

23
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,660
he went to the Vietnam war as a child.
You know,

24
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,890
he's a young man,
18 years old.

25
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,080
When he left high school,
he didn't have to because it was all

26
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:58,650
sisters and he wanted to because he
wanted to go because everyone in the

27
00:00:58,651 --> 00:00:59,730
rented town,
Petersburg,

28
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:00,564
Virginia,
excuse me,

29
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,710
Jarret,
Virginia,

30
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,860
everybody from his town,
the young men will go on its own cousins

31
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:06,300
and everybody.
So he went,

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,040
he came back,
um,

33
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,460
disturbed.
He came back different than when he went

34
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:15,150
in and he was actually missing for quite
a time that they were going to declare

35
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,970
him dead when he showed up one day,
um,

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,220
with a trench coat on army boots and
naked and hosie street in Brooklyn.

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,220
So this led to him being mentally
disturbed all my life.

38
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,120
He would talk to himself.
He lived with us.

39
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,040
I slept in a twin bed here and he slept
in the bed there and he was with

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,380
alcohol.
He drank,

41
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:39,360
he became very violent.
You know,

42
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:44,361
he beat my mom up one time really bad
cause I had eyes up and him talking to

43
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,640
himself with something.
I grew up all my life watching and I'm

44
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,461
like,
amy crazy.

45
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:49,740
You called amy amy,
you crazy.

46
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:51,420
You can't.
He told me to itself so,

47
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,290
and I got older,
I would just refuse to even have a

48
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,190
conversation with myself.
Oh you crazy if you,

49
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,770
and four years ago I started having
conversations with myself.

50
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,100
I was like,
Yo,

51
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,290
you know what champ,
you got to go.

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,210
And I start saying,
let's go champ.

53
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:07,044
And I was like,
ma'am,

54
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,850
I asked,
my wife was so you think I'm crazy cause

55
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:09,580
I spoke.

56
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,550
She was like,
yeah,

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,120
we already know you crazy.
You know what I mean?

58
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,220
So I'm like,
you know,

59
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,020
and it just,
and that was my mantra.

60
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,190
It became my mantra.
You know,

61
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,610
my friend told me one of his mantras was
to be the man,

62
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:23,430
you've got to be the man.
When he was tired,

63
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,400
he was running mile 18 to beat a man,
you've got to beat the man,

64
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,530
be the man.
You gotta beat a man.

65
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,420
I was just saying to himself and I was
like,

66
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,410
you know,
I need a mantra,

67
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,840
and I was hitting the bag one day and I
was tired.

68
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,700
I was like 400 pounds.
I was like,

69
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,920
let's go champ.
That's gonna Chair.

70
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,100
That's her chair.
You know,

71
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,800
and it's in the head champ.
You know when I'm feeling pain,

72
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,330
you feel in pain,
you're feeling down.

73
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,740
Tell yourself,
let's go champ.

74
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,350
Let's go champ.
To what I hear you when I work out.

75
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:52,350
Sometimes it's yours.
I thought she didn't push it through and

76
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,200
set as yours.
It's yours.

77
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,800
It's everybody's.
It's the people's man.

78
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,570
The people.
The people gave me this,

79
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,710
the universe gave me this,
that people,

80
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,220
the people

81
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,410
linked into it and it's not mine,
it's ours.

82
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,440
We just want to give each other
positivity and love and I meet people

83
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,121
from everywhere.
Chan,

84
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:08,950
I'm a little nuts because I go to every
city or country and people say,

85
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:10,720
chair,
but I'm in the lobby or I'm in this

86
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:11,411
town.
Could I meet you?

87
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,060
And I say,
come over to the hotel.

88
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,560
And they come.
You know what I mean?

89
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,221
They call.
I mean,

90
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,930
you might have to stop that when you
went a people.

91
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,700
I'm the people's champ.
I'm free.

92
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,100
I'm here for the people.
Wow,

93
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,963
man,
that's strong.

94
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,081
Uh,
things.

95
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:27,100
And when I went to,
I interview Senator Mark Pocan last week

96
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,590
about,
he was the one that wrote a letter to

97
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,360
the government.
He wants to keep Kratom legal.

98
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,610
He thinks that,
you know,

99
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,600
it should be allowed for everyone.
And I said to him,

100
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,580
what do you think about marijuana?

101
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,260
And he was like,
I just think it should all be legal.

102
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,950
And it was the first time I was ever in
the presence of somebody that works for

103
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:45,340
the government saying that they think
that weed and Kratom and all this stuff

104
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:49,120
should be illegal.
And it's because he had a good head on

105
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,330
his shoulders about the problems that
people face every day.

106
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,310
You know,
it's not black and white.

107
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:56,230
Like I live in this gray area,
I don't,

108
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,250
I,
I'm in a lot of pain,

109
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:00,580
but I don't want to take opiates and I
shouldn't have to take opiates.

110
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,860
So where's the pressure coming from to
turn this stuff into a schedule one

111
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,000
drug?
If there's no,

112
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,300
if there's no negative response by the
body,

113
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,520
you're not having people die of
overdoses.

114
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:15,150
Is there an ld 50 rate on this stuff?
Well,

115
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,350
if you look at it,
you know,

116
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,310
I mean you're saying where,
where's the ld 50 explained?

117
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,080
We should probably explain to people
lethal dose at 50% meaning if you take

118
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,750
50 rats and you give them a pound of
this shit,

119
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,310
50 of them are 25 and die at a certain
show.

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,640
We've heard about,
you know,

121
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,350
there's been no deaths from marijuana,
right?

122
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,990
Right.
Yeah.

123
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,740
Freedom is the same thing.
No,

124
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,360
no deaths.
There have been zero deaths and there,

125
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,380
there have actually been 15 deaths that
have been brought to the FDA and the dea

126
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,540
is attention.
Those 15 that's,

127
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,910
I actually went and interviewed one of
the,

128
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,770
one of the mothers,
the kid was on three psych meds.

129
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,720
He was withdrawn.
He was honored with withdrawing from

130
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:53,110
three different psych meds.
I have a black box warning that says,

131
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:54,280
warning,
if you're a teenager,

132
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:56,050
you might commit suicide.
Basically,

133
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,340
and this kid committed suicide.
He didn't die from a Kratom overdose.

134
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,230
He died from committing suicide.

135
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,560
And his mother wants to blame Kratom.
She doesn't think that the,

136
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,530
uh,
the psych meds had anything to do with

137
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,000
it.
And I don't want to say that Kratom had

138
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,650
nothing to do with it.
We don't really know.

139
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,680
And what I really call for with Kratom
is just more research.

140
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,190
Like I want people to put in the money
to do the research,

141
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:21,730
to make sure that this is safe.
And let's see if we can solve this

142
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:24,520
opiate epidemic.
Let's see if we can crack down.

143
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,490
You know,
basically lower the amount of opiate

144
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:30,460
prescriptions we have in this country.
I just read an article the other day.

145
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:34,390
One in seven people in America are going
to be affected with addiction problems.

146
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,400
Wow,
that's crazy.

147
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,680
One in seven.
Yeah.

148
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,660
That means somebody in your family,
that's insane.

149
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,330
Somebody in your family will be be
affected by it.

150
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,450
And that's 10% yeah,
that's weird.

151
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,680
[inaudible].
