1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:01,821
you know,

3
00:00:01,821 --> 00:00:06,620
like we always argue that marijuana
is a mild hallucinogenic and you know,

4
00:00:06,621 --> 00:00:07,454
therefore,

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,340
uh,

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:09,530
uh,

7
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,090
a safer and fun or alternative to
being drunk and necessarily or blah,

8
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:14,211
blah,

9
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:14,720
blah.

10
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,650
As Louis Armstrong said,

11
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:16,250
what it's worth,

12
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,690
it's worth a hundred assistants,

13
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,910
uh,

14
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,450
worth a hundred assistance.

15
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:21,040
Yeah.

16
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,680
When you said eight,

17
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,101
he said,

18
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:22,820
I don't know.

19
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,091
Oh No.

20
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:24,860
He would have said it's better
than a hundred whiskeys.

21
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:25,430
Sorry.

22
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,250
He said he always considered
it a friend and assistant.

23
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:28,700
Oh,

24
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,180
that's funny.

25
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,170
Which I thought was really funny,

26
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:30,760
but,

27
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,970
but psychedelics are like,

28
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:32,391
if you say,

29
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:33,350
if you took psychedelics,

30
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:33,920
uh,

31
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,753
people go,

32
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,111
you know,

33
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:36,944
you're a drug addict.

34
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:37,891
Well,

35
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,611
if you smoke weed,

36
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,444
you're a pothead.

37
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,523
You know what I am,

38
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,030
I am as well.

39
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,160
But what I found out that you were,

40
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,641
uh,

41
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,361
I thought,

42
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:45,630
uh,

43
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:45,931
when,

44
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:46,051
uh,

45
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:49,620
I found out that you were the one who
actually did you introduce Doug Benson to

46
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:50,454
marijuana?

47
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,293
That's the legend.

48
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,510
If you saw that Werner Herzog movie,

49
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,050
uh,

50
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,520
it's written on one of the cave walls.

51
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,354
There's this,

52
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,540
there's a Petroglyph
of Doug and I stylized.

53
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:00,961
Of course,

54
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,160
you can't hardly recognize it.

55
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:03,120
So you can see my glasses.

56
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,090
It's a from hundreds of years ago.

57
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:09,360
And Doug and I were in San Diego
at the Pacific Beach Improv.

58
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,200
If you remember that one.

59
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:10,561
No,

60
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:10,981
I don't.

61
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,930
Well here was this 58,

62
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,593
um,

63
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,860
we had just finished doing a roast at
the friars [inaudible] we're playing San

64
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,380
Diego and he claims that
he had smoked before,

65
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,071
but knock on high,

66
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:23,521
you know what I mean?

67
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,810
Like he'd had some,

68
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,950
so cause a lot of times,

69
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:26,161
you know,

70
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:28,800
you have to get high a few
times before it kicks in.

71
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,353
Uh,

72
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,170
and then I brought a bunch of weed and,

73
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,390
and I remember what I remember is the
Condo was near the beach and we were just

74
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,250
fucking doofuses and you know,

75
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
we would just go to the
beach every day you get high.

76
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,700
And then when we weren't at the beach,

77
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,160
we would watch MTVs beach party.

78
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,181
Oh my God.

79
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,360
I remember him laying on the couch
laughing hysterically at one point and

80
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:49,260
kicking his legs in the air.

81
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:49,651
And I was like,

82
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,730
let's go get this tacos.

83
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:51,121
And he was like,

84
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:51,541
dude,

85
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:51,781
you know,

86
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,990
and like it was just that
stupid of that weekend.

87
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,141
We,

88
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:55,950
let's fucking,

89
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,800
and then at night we'd go desats
we're working at the Improv.

90
00:01:59,250 --> 00:01:59,551
And,

91
00:01:59,551 --> 00:01:59,820
uh,

92
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,350
he claims that was where he started.

93
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:06,351
And I guess the carefree lifestyle that
we were living that week seduced him so

94
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:10,800
hard because if it's beguiling poetry
that he realized he as an independent

95
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:11,131
soul,

96
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,780
he could finally take
control of his own destiny.

97
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:17,010
But I had a kid say to me once where
I was on the road and like Addison,

98
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,490
Texas or something and that the guy was
working with a nice fellow and he would

99
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:23,580
go out and you buy it like peanut that
I ran like cereal that you'd see on TV

100
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,001
and stuff,

101
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,710
which made me laugh cause
I'm from San Francisco,

102
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:25,921
you know,

103
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:26,260
and I'm like,

104
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,640
he would come back with like what a
shopping lists you'd see on television,

105
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:30,780
like wonder bread and,

106
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
and he's a nice fellow.

107
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,733
Uh,

108
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,591
and he would,

109
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,790
he would run and whatnot.

110
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,630
And I was late.

111
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,620
I remember what year it was.

112
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:37,801
It was,

113
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:41,730
I was watching the needed hill hearings
on TV and that was a Raiders game that

114
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,550
weekend or niners game and there was a
fire in the East Bay and you can see the

115
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,670
fire [inaudible] was 90
90 91 somewhere in there,

116
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,531
laying on the couch,

117
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:50,221
smoking weed,

118
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,054
and he goes,

119
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,950
you're going to smoke pot
all fucking day proofs.

120
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:53,784
And I go,

121
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,990
let me ask you something.

122
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,681
Whatever his name was,

123
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,514
Danny,

124
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,443
again,

125
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,010
let me ask you something.

126
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,000
Who kills every night and you,

127
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,183
you do

128
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,800
you have your program?

129
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,211
Well people,

130
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:07,991
his board too.

131
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:09,130
I was trapped in the condo.

132
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:09,710
There was no,

133
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,680
it was one of those ones
that wasn't near anything.

134
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,120
I think a waffle house or something.

135
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:18,121
But if you wanted it to be tactical
about like a comics time creating,

136
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,510
it's all day and it's all
day watching TV and you're,

137
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:25,120
you could be scanning for something
that inspires you enough to be your next

138
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:25,954
closing bit.

139
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,160
So you're actually working.

140
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,900
So even when you're lounging,

141
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:29,734
you're working.

142
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,360
I think of Stephanie and Dad,

143
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,471
I man,

144
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:32,710
Dad,

145
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,150
and if I wake up in the
middle of the night,

146
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:34,870
I go,

147
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,060
I need to do the thing tomorrow.

148
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,420
I have to think of this.

149
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:39,400
And then I think of it and you know,

150
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,160
I would argue that the creative process,

151
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,660
you can manufacture it.

152
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,583
Yes.

153
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,190
But it works better if you down.

154
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,191
Yeah.

155
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,024
It's a,

156
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,900
everybody goes dry.

157
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,980
Sometimes you get to drive it.

158
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,080
Also working hard makes you not go dry.

159
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,071
That's true too.

160
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:54,904
It's a muscle.

161
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,450
Yeah.

162
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,161
I think the,

163
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:56,600
the,

164
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,400
there's like a vibe that you get into
when you're really writing a lot and that

165
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:01,660
vibe sort of like,

166
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,040
it just,

167
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,250
it,

168
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:02,740
it,

169
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,420
it becomes like a part of your
consciousness and then the,

170
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,690
the more you feed it
and the more you do it,

171
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,820
I think that's what the
thing with everything,

172
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,481
every,

173
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,770
everything that a person does,

174
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,500
whether it's an art form
or a musical instrument,

175
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
and if it isn't an art form,

176
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,390
it's not important Joe,

177
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:16,870
but go on.

178
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,140
True.

179
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,973
It is true.

180
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,450
Yeah.

181
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,270
The idea of the creative
process is something that's
always been so fascinating

182
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:22,541
to me.

183
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:22,810
And like,

184
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,760
I love listening to
how other people do it.

185
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,110
And especially comics,

186
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,490
like some of them are just fucking,

187
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,040
they just sit down and put in the time.

188
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:34,630
They just put in the hours and some of
them just sit around and watch things all

189
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,690
day and scratch their head and look at
the Internet and just poke around and

190
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,524
prod,

191
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,491
you know,

192
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:41,200
and then some of them,

193
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,831
they just,

194
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:42,220
uh,

195
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,380
they just write in and stand up for them.

196
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:45,880
Some people write in blog form,

197
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,990
don't you love when you think a joke
springs fully formed from your breast and

198
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:53,620
you haven't thought of it.

199
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:56,590
It just comes out and you do
it and it's perfect and you go,

200
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,220
uh,

201
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,390
like people always say,

202
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,224
you know,

203
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,580
whatever,

204
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,413
the Beatles,

205
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,390
um,

206
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,320
how did you write that song?

207
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,280
And sometimes they'll go,

208
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,233
honestly,

209
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,830
I sat down and it,

210
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,963
you know what I mean?

211
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,810
I had it,

212
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,650
I didn't write it.

213
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,210
I,

214
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,950
yeah,

215
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,890
came out and like every once in a while
there'll be a joke that you think of and

216
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,510
it's just the right one.

217
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,630
And it made it not be
like genius or anything.

218
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,240
It's just that feeling of when it um,

219
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,010
that your,

220
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,870
that your subconscious pushed it out and
you weren't fucking with it in any way

221
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,070
and therefore it's,

222
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,170
perfection is different than
something you worked on.

223
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:32,921
Yeah.

224
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,570
There's this weird thing of,

225
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,250
again it goes back to the ego,

226
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,960
this weird thing of what whoever
the fuck you think of yourself as,

227
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:41,231
you know,

228
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:44,020
this self defining sort of image that,

229
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:44,260
you know,

230
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,110
you put up as like sort of
a wall for tuck very much.

231
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,411
Yeah.

232
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:49,960
And when you want to
take credit for the idea,

233
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,803
what would,

234
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,970
the way creativity comes,

235
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:54,290
it comes when you're in the state of like,

236
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,770
like open when you're open to receive it.

237
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,140
When you're really thinking about things
like completely all your resources are

238
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:00,974
on the thing.

239
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,150
Not about the bullshit,

240
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,290
not about like trying to craft an
image on stage or trying to formulate

241
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,860
something that you think is going to make
the back of the room laugh and of that

242
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,850
it's all coming from like a true openness.

243
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,811
And then they did.

244
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,760
It just comes like as you,

245
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,100
sometimes it's just like moments,

246
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,820
you know,

247
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,090
these,

248
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,450
these bursts of ideas will come to
you and they are just gifts from the

249
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,240
university and they hit you like waves
and you can't even write them down quick

250
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,700
enough and you're giggling
while you're writing on it.

251
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:28,180
Yeah.

252
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,420
And it's like a gift.

253
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,710
It's like a gift for thinking the right
way or a gift for approaching it with

254
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,000
the correct respect.

255
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,630
Like realizing that you are the lucky
one to be able to tune into this.

256
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,800
It's not that you're this fabulous person
who you know is so awesome because you

257
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:43,581
say funny shit.

258
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:43,730
No,

259
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,200
you're the lucky one that has found this
ability to tune into these ideas and

260
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:51,200
you should praise these
ideas and honor these ideas.

261
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,034
It's true.

262
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,220
I think just pushing yourself
to think of something.

263
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,320
I repeat myself a million times,

264
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:59,270
but to think of something
new when you're riffing.

265
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,860
Yeah.

266
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,220
It's how I hard.

267
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,363
That's really hard.

268
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,100
Like on the podcast,

269
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:04,640
I,

270
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,240
uh,

271
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,570
I'll just attempt things
sometimes that aren't that funny,

272
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,800
but I'm like trying to,

273
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,143
you know,

274
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,950
like disconnect.

275
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,001
So that you're,

276
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,380
you're kind of trying to automatic,

277
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:15,651
right?

278
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:16,484
If you can,

279
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,350
you're a fucking human being.
