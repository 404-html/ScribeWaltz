00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,170
Hello Freak bitches.
I'm telling you man,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,560
just looking at that thing right there 
when you're talking about the guy hasn't

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:12,090
done standup in forever and he just goes
up there and murders it like that and is

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,430
in perfect form.
His timing is perfect.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,350
He's a fucking fantastic standup.
Such a talent,

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,570
Huh?
Amazing.

7
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:21,480
Unbelievable.
Crazy run to again now.

8
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,650
Huh?
I see him all the time.

9
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:23,970
I see on your instagram.
Yeah.

10
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,710
We hang out at the comedy store all the 
time.

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,613
She was always there.
He took me some eyes wide shut party in 

12
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,590
the middle of the Hollywood hills.
We had a.

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,120
You had to get in an elevator and go to 
the top of this hill.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,133
Yeah,
it was Naomi Campbell had his birthday 

15
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:38,070
party and so dave's like,
hey joe,

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,620
you want to go with me to this party?
And I'm like,

17
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,540
dude,
I don't,

18
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,990
I don't like going to those parties.

19
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,880
I like avoiding celebrity things.
Like,

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,400
oh come on man,
I got to be back here by midnight.

21
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:48,540
Anyway,
I go,

22
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,880
all right.
So we're looking crazy amounts of weed.

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,790
Fuck,
we uh,

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,330
we get my portion will go up to the top 
of this hill,

25
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,530
get even more baked,
go get,

26
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,870
get in a shuttle that takes you up to 
this dude's house.

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,880
And some dude who has the sickest house 
at the top of the Hollywood hill.

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,620
It's just some crazy billionaire 
character who has a sick house.

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,670
And then above his sick house he has a 
sick party house type.

30
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,683
He has just a party house.
So you go to the top of this house and 

31
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:25,431
he has this fucking insane view of the 
city where it looks like blade runner,

32
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,360
you know,
and he's got one 80 degrees of windows.

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,890
His party house is like a,
like a flying saucer that just got stuck

34
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:36,030
in the side of a building.

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,500
But the whole outside edge of the flying
saucer is all windows.

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,843
So you're sitting there with all seats 
around the windows and then he has his 

37
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:44,364
big bar and he hasn't.
I mean the guy's just closes all loaded 

38
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,440
with the.
And we have to take an elevator,

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,303
like a foreperson elevator openair 
elevator that goes up the side of the 

40
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:54,324
hill.
And as we're going up the side of the 

41
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:58,490
hill and Naomi Campbell's naked photo is
40,

42
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,590
50 feet tall and I'm not kidding,
I'm not exaggerating,

43
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,830
it's just enormous naked photo of Naomi 
Campbell.

44
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,890
And then we get up to the top and it's 
like fucking demean Moore's there.

45
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,870
And I'm saying hi to Lenny Kravitz.
I'm like,

46
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:14,871
this is so strange.
So high last barbecue barbecued,

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,460
so,
so high.

48
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,303
Shouldn't be out in public and up there 
with all these fucking super rich 

49
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,880
people.
I'm like,

50
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:24,540
what's up lenny?

51
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,291
Hey,
what's up man?

52
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,030
How you doing?
We're talking to Lenny Kravitz.

53
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,670
Like how bizarre is this just seems.
Yeah,

54
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,700
it seems really nice.
But it was all these.

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,230
I was talking to these musicians dudes 
about mma.

56
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,530
It was like I got cornered by all these 
musicians.

57
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,910
Started throwing up fighting this.
Oh my God,

58
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:39,750
man.
Dude.

59
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,450
People get so excited.
He gets so excited.

60
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:44,820
They want to start talking mma.
I've got a guy who knows.

61
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,753
Got Meanwhile,
I'm like anything to relax my anxiety 

62
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,180
right now.
I'll tell you all the shit I wake up,

63
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,200
write down whatever the fuck you want.
Fighters who you know who's gonna win 17

64
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,890
schedule,
he was with the part about it,

65
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,900
like there was one point in the night.
No,

66
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,050
Campbell is for a book that she has a 
book coming out and for.

67
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,280
She's very nice too,
by the way.

68
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,240
Super Nice and beautiful timepiece.
One hundred percent.

69
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,700
I don't know how old she is.
She's got to be 40,

70
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,830
right?
I would imagine.

71
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,900
I say closer to 50.
Really?

72
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,800
Yeah,
because it on the backside.

73
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,510
Crawford is 50 now.
I think she's 49.

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,180
I think she's a little older than that.
I think she's.

75
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,390
She's,
she's,

76
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,880
she's Naomi Campbell.
40 five.

77
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,370
How old is Cindy Crawford?
She's probably still just turned 15.

78
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,900
Noemi Campbell.
40 five.

79
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,970
Still fucking slamming hot.
Right.

80
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,010
So anyway,
she stops in the middle of this thing.

81
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:44,170
They have this,
they have these photos of her.

82
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,653
Her book is out and it's this exclusive 
book that cost like 1500 bucks or 

83
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,740
something like that to that much.
Really big,

84
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,330
high glossy.
The whole deal.

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,333
Don't.
She just stops and they start taking 

86
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:58,060
photos over and she just starts posing.
So no one talks.

87
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,983
No one's taught like everyone is just 
watching because it's Naomi Campbell 

88
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,774
party,
so it's almost like Michael Bolton gets 

89
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,981
out of his party and starts shaking my 
cell phone,

90
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,920
but it's like that.
She's doing her thing posing crap.

91
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,913
That's how amazing go and there's just.
It was a kind of a fascinating little 

92
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:20,914
party.
It was a good thing to dip my toe into 

93
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:23,204
it and get the fuck out of there as 
quickly as realize why you don't go to 

94
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:25,170
those.

95
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,003
Yeah,
well it's just,

96
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,570
it's they're too famous to famous and 
it's,

97
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,370
it's what it is is to me.
It's like,

98
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,920
Ooh,
don't get that famous for sure.

99
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:34,610
Back off if you didn't get weird.
Well,

100
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,210
everybody gets weird.
It's weird.

101
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,123
They're weird people when they have to 
hang out with each other because nobody 

102
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,054
else is gonna understand.
You know that I was talking to Dave 

103
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:42,670
about that.
I go,

104
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,110
do you like hanging out with 
celebrities?

105
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:47,030
Because they're the only people that 
understand what your lives are.

106
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,920
He's like,
Oh man,

107
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,860
but I'm not as famous as them.
I go hit the brakes.

108
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,400
I go,
Dad's party problem.

109
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:53,234
Yup.
You don't understand how fucking famous 

110
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,273
you are.
The most famous comedians that's ever 

111
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,460
lived and one of the most famous 
celebrities in America,

112
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:01,294
like if there's a 100 list of the most 
famous people in America in chapels on 

113
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,800
that.
I'm not on that list.

114
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,690
I like to stay on the outskirts,
that list.

115
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,880
I like to be in the suburbs that I don't
know Joe.

116
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,250
Oh,
I think you're in that world,

117
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,103
but I'm definitely not.
Definitely so right now you're closing 

118
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,590
in on.
You ain't quitting.

119
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,453
Slowing down,
slowing down and thinking about moving 

120
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:28,660
to like Yosemite,
which you do that both with Eva.
