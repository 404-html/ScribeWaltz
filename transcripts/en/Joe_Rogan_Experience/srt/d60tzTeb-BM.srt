1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,790
I think we're in a kind of period of,
uh,

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,050
late modernism,
renewed modernism in which,

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,960
uh,
the modern style,

4
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:20,961
which was mistakenly given up for dead
in the 80s with postmodernism,

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,830
uh,
has kind of come back reinventing itself

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,160
much more urbane correcting some of the
mistakes of modernism first time around

7
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:34,380
when it was so anti urban,
uh,

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,010
and with much more either restraint in
some cases and clarity and almost

9
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:46,080
sometimes minimalism and,
and,

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,110
or a kind of more expressionistic strain
so that we see different strains.

11
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:56,850
And I do not think that this is a time
that can be summarized in any single ism

12
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:58,020
anyway.
Uh,

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
there's too many different things going
on,

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,650
but,
uh,

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,030
probably the one that is kind of the
most,

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,600
uh,
unifying or compelling of the time to

17
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:14,601
the extent that anything can pull a
diverse time together would be this sort

18
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:18,330
of late,
modernist moment that we're in where

19
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,250
really good architects are reinventing
the modernist vocabulary

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,230
where we're at right now.

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,200
It's,
it's hard to ever encapsulate that with

22
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,100
a single building.
I mean,

23
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:33,480
there was a time,
you know,

24
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:37,530
it doesn't years ago when frank,
Gary's Guggenheim museum in Bilbao seem

25
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,900
to sort of sum up everything.
And it did and it,

26
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:40,310
it,
it,

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,120
it was really the,
the symbolic beginning of a whole age of

28
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:49,620
architecture and they age of intense
engagement with architecture and with

29
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,790
doing buildings in some cases were
really quite wonderful and brilliant

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,660
and,
and,

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,910
uh,
profound even,

32
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,590
uh,
other cases,

33
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,120
buildings that would just sort of
excessive.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,750
Right now we've kind of pulled back from
that a lot,

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,670
but we're not entirely sure where we're
going.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,820
Uh,
there's a tremendous interest in

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,260
sustainability today and in
environmentalism and buildings being

38
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:15,940
responsible from a green standpoint,
uh,

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,170
which is all to the good,
there's a greater sense,

40
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,530
I think,
of the building as part of a larger,

41
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:27,030
whole and less as an individual
standalone monument.

42
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,140
So we're more concerned with urbanism,
how buildings relate to each other on

43
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,990
the street and as part of a community,
we're more concerned,

44
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:35,970
I think with planning,
I'd like to hope.

45
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:37,320
And so,
uh,

46
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,550
we're not believing that you can keep
growing and spreading out forever and

47
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,320
ever across the landscape that,
that,

48
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,740
uh,
we've got to make our cities denser and

49
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,350
tighter in part to preserve the land.
Uh,

50
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,360
I sense a lot of that right now.
Much more willingness to begin to

51
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:59,361
consider alternate forms of housing as
reflections of alternate forms of living

52
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,750
and alternative family structures and
things like that.

53
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,800
You know,
uh,

54
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,830
for a long time we've just assumed that
everybody would fit into the same little

55
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,510
pigeonholed box,
either a little suburban house or an

56
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:20,260
apartment in the city or whatever that
was designed for a very traditional

57
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,120
nuclear family.
In fact,

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,840
family structures are different now and
they're changing and they're more

59
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,210
options.
And so why aren't there more housing

60
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:30,340
options at the same time to reflect
that?

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,610
You hear more people at least talking
about that now.

62
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,260
And I think if we were not in this
difficult recession where it's tough to

63
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:41,290
build anything,
we'd actually see more real stuff

64
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,570
happening right now.
But with luck,

65
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:48,571
we can use this time to plan,
to sort of develop ideas and be ready to

66
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,160
do more interesting stuff when the time
comes.

67
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,180
Hopefully pretty soon.
