1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,490
All right,
we're live.

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,220
What's up?
How are weird,

3
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:12,670
right?
Yeah.

4
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:13,780
Here we go.
Nice to meet you man.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,380
Thank you.
Yeah,

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,060
I can't believe we've never met.
Yeah.

7
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:16,660
Well,
uh,

8
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,460
I've been a fan of your music for a long
time,

9
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:21,370
so it's Kinda cool to see you in person.
I've worked out conversely,

10
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:24,880
so it's cool.
So I mean,

11
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:26,590
I don't mean to just jump right into 
this,

12
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,950
but it kind of freaked me out that your 
have involvement in pro wrestling.

13
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:31,270
The own.
The NWA.

14
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:31,700
Yeah.

15
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,910
The national wrestling alliance,
the oldest brand in the world I was 

16
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,620
working for TNA was president for a hot 
second.

17
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,870
Then I got fired.
And you were President of TNA.

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,400
Yeah.
Yeah,

19
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,410
that's a crazy story.
I don't know how much you want to get 

20
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:47,410
into that.
Well,

21
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,700
you know,
Dixie Carter own TNA.

22
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,790
I knew her through the years.
I used to go to shows and stuff like 

23
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,551
that and um,
and at some point they approached me 

24
00:00:57,551 --> 00:00:58,940
about investing.
I said No.

25
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:01,310
Then they offered me a job.
I started working for the company.

26
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,200
Then they would,
they have started having money problems.

27
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:05,990
They started putting money in and 
through the contrivance of all that,

28
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:08,990
then I started getting more power in the
company and putting in more money.

29
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:10,070
So then it became like,
well,

30
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,680
if I'm going to put in all this money 
and I'm going to have all this power,

31
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:13,700
I want to run the show.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,210
They basically said that was cool.
And then the minute I had the spot,

33
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,290
it was like,
game of thrones.

34
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,280
They all started trying to kill me off 
and then,

35
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,290
you know,
wrestling's weird because you have this 

36
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,360
weird mix of reality and fantasy and 
it's hard sometimes to know where one 

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,460
thing and the fans get into both the 
behind the scenes and the fantasy.

38
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:33,680
So no one's quite sure sometimes where 
the blur is.

39
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,040
And he had got pretty crazy for a while.
There's a lawsuit.

40
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,460
I'm a real lawsuit sued.
I sued,

41
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:43,610
and this is a quick funny thing.
Um,

42
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,060
people continually write that I lost the
lawsuit.

43
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,070
I never lost the lawsuit.
I lost one of the motions which led to 

44
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,920
them mean negotiating.
And we settled out of court.

45
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,650
But the judge,
the contract that they signed,

46
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,910
that would have allowed me to take over 
the company under the,

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
under the motion that I had filed,
the judge basically dismissed my motion 

48
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,420
because the contract they had signed 
with me was illegal under Tennessee law 

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
even though a Tennessee lawyer had 
negotiated on the company's behalf and 

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
signed it.
Whoa.

51
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,710
That sounds like some double cross 
wrestling type guy.

52
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:20,310
So it'd be like

53
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,840
you did a contract with me and then I 
sued you.

54
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:25,250
And then the judge says,
well,

55
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,230
even though Joe had a California lawyer 
sign,

56
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,310
it's illegal under California law.
So therefore the contracts meaningless.

57
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,590
It was bizarre.
How does one go from smashing pumpkins 

58
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,390
pro wrestling and then go so deep that 
you're like an owner?

59
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,940
Yeah,
no,

60
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:45,941
it's,
it's pretty wild and unexpected for a 

61
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:46,180
lot of people,
right?

62
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:46,540
Yeah,
yeah.

63
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,530
No,
I get that a lot.

64
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,060
Um,
and I've learned and I've actually,

65
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,150
I've actually learned over time,
it's just best to keep the world 

66
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,680
separate because the music fans don't 
want to hear anything about the 

67
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,680
wrestling.
I mean,

68
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,910
they just don't want to.
They just,

69
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,440
they,
they get the a that I'm a bit goofy,

70
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,050
but they just don't want to hear about 
the wrestling thing they asked.

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,550
They asked the worlds to be kept 
separate.

72
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,140
Did they ever get mad at you?
Oh yeah.

73
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,840
Yeah.
You know,

74
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,030
and you can appreciate that.
It kills the gimmick.

75
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,120
They want me to be this gothic vampire 
guy or whatever,

76
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:13,710
and then it's like.

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,040
And then,
and then there's pro wrestling.

78
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,200
It's just,
it just totally kills the gimmick.

79
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,230
It's really funny though.
I think it's awesome.

80
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,590
I love it when people just get into what
they like.

81
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,900
Well that's something I appreciate about
you.

82
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,910
You know what I mean?
Like I've watched where you guys go deep

83
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,650
dives and mma and other things.
It's like,

84
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,540
I think it's cool to have multiple 
interests.

85
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,970
I at the renaissance man thing.
Yeah.

86
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:38,971
Well I think for,
for some reason people shy away from 

87
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:39,310
them because they think folks are going 
to be confused.

88
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,310
I don't care.
Yeah.

89
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,250
Good for you.
That's awesome.

90
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,390
Yeah,
no,

91
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,410
I'd grown up in Chicago.
There was a really rich wrestling 

92
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:48,410
history in Chicago growing up and my,
my,

93
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,090
my great grandmother watch wrestling.
I mean it was like I grew up in,

94
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,900
at four years old,
I'm watching Dick,

95
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:57,901
the bruiser on television and this was 
also the era of hockey fights and I'm 

96
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:58,360
roller derby.

97
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,800
Oh,
road debbie.

98
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,810
So we'd watch hockey,
pro wrestling,

99
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,880
you know,
it was in the family and then later I 

100
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:06,910
found out that my other great 
grandmother also watch wrestling,

101
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:11,911
so both sides of the family,
both her great grandmother sweatshirt 

102
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:12,280
wrestling.
So it's just in the blood I guess.

103
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,020
We liked that we liked the car and have 
at all.

104
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,330
Well,
I'm always amazed at Roller Derby.

105
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,670
I've never made like a serious comeback.
They tried,

106
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,030
they kind of did the,
you know,

107
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:23,710
the tattooed girl's doing roller Derby 
hipstery type thing.

108
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,600
It had a moment there.
Well,

109
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,170
I know I had a friend who was into it 
and she was that type.

110
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,630
I just thought,
well that seems like something that 

111
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:34,630
would catch on today.
Yeah.

112
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,190
They transitioned from like Roller Derby
to suicide girls.

113
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,770
Yeah.
It was like to get a little hotter,

114
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,390
that girl,
you can be thick and be a roller derby 

115
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,390
girl.

116
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,200
You could,
you could eat all the carbs you liked,

117
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,350
but didn't roller derby back in the day 
was huge.

118
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:52,351
Yeah.
I mean they were doing like packed 

119
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,351
arenas and stuff.
That's crazy.

120
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,351
Well,
it's fun to watch.

121
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,720
It's pretty wild.
Yeah.

122
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,270
I only see him go after each other and 
skating around.

123
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,520
It's pretty aggressive.
It's fun.

124
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,550
It's fun.
It's like racing plus fighting and hip 

125
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,340
checking each other,
you know,

126
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,540
it's early days memory,
but I remember thinking,

127
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,630
you know,
there's something sort of hot about the 

128
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:09,880
whole thing.
I think especially in Chicago,

129
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:12,060
the women's Roller Derby was bigger than
the men's,

130
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,390
so that says something.
Yeah.

131
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:15,190
I didn't even know there was men's 
roller derby,

132
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,010
like thinking of men's Roller Derby.
I,

133
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,060
I'm completely drawing a blank.
I always associated it with like tough 

134
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,060
women.
Yeah.

135
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,360
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

136
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:27,361
I think the women's thing actually had 
some sort of staying power where the 

137
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:27,950
men's,
I think it didn't have the same alert or

138
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,200
maybe.
Yeah.

139
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,490
Yeah.
I guess,

140
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,290
uh,
you're,

141
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,010
you're my age.
You remember killer Kowalski Course?

142
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,030
Yeah,
I remember watching that when I was a 

143
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,570
kid in Boston watching it on the,
on regular tv,

144
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:42,640
you know,
that those guys were great.

145
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,220
I mean,
it's a golden age.

146
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,740
It's like anything you can go back and 
sort of romanticize it.

147
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,450
And um,
I think that's part of what we're trying

148
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,610
to do is,
that's the cool thing about the nw is we

149
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:56,611
actually possess that history and,
and so our job is to sort of update it,

150
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,160
you know,
to bring

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
it,
to bring that tough guy thing back into 

152
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,920
the modern world in a way that doesn't 
insult the audience's intelligence.

153
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,870
So the Nwa is that older than the wwe I 
1948 is the Nwa.

154
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,430
And the cool thing about the end was 
history was you had all these rival 

155
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,961
promoters,
including the mcmahons in the northeast 

156
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:22,211
that eventually sort of formed a kind of
ad hoc association to create a better 

157
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,980
business in essence,
get everybody on the same page.

158
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,280
And what they would do is they named one
champion the champion,

159
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,240
rotate through the different 
territories,

160
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,720
come in and take on the whoever was the 
local guy,

161
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,930
they build up the local guy and then a 
guy like rick flair would come in and 

162
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,260
beat the local guy and it would always 
be like a bit of a scrum.

163
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:44,261
And then he'd come back for a second,
there would be a cage match and then 

164
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:44,261
rick flair would move onto the next 
territory.

165
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,760
And that's how those guys rotate around 
and everybody made more money.

166
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Wow.
And then the government got involved at 

167
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,300
different points because there was 
collusion.

168
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,480
There you go.
There's ric flair with our belt.

169
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,800
Actually I follow him on instagram.
Yeah.

170
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,460
Yeah.
I mean Rick,

171
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,820
Rick's rick in a dusty,
dusty Rhodes,

172
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,610
or are probably the two most prominent 
chance that the Nwa had.

173
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:08,810
So just to be the owner of that history 
is so humbling for me as a fan.

174
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:09,530
It's like,
wow,

175
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,150
that is so cool.
Yeah,

176
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,250
that's pretty wild actually.
He's,

177
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:18,251
uh,
he's quite a character and still is 

178
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:18,251
like,
even on instagram stories,

179
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,610
stories are legendary.
Stories are absolutely wondering,

180
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,660
30 for 30 just came out about them and 
I'm hearing it's like one of the best 

181
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:25,760
ones ever made.
Just the day to day,

182
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,470
maybe two days ago.
Oh cool.

183
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,720
Then I,
and I'm not trying to speak for rick,

184
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:31,200
but you know,
there's,

185
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,280
there's an example of somebody where 
it's like the persona and the real life 

186
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,130
person sort of blurred.

187
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,420
Right.
And it's hard to figure out who was who 

188
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:42,420
at any given time that you know,
that's the case.

189
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,360
Like dice clay.
Oh yeah.

190
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:44,810
Okay.
Yeah,

191
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,030
yeah.
He used to be Andrew Silverstein and the

192
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:50,120
dice man was a character needs to do on 
stage as he now is.

193
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,890
He now become 100 percent all Manson's 
that my friend had friends,

194
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,170
Marilyn Manson.
He's the same way.

195
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:59,171
It's like they become,
they become the gimmick at some point 

196
00:07:59,171 --> 00:07:59,540
and sometimes you're not sure who you're
talking to,

197
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:04,541
but,
but at some point you also have to 

198
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,281
respect that that's so intrinsic to 
their world that maybe it's almost 

199
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:07,780
easier just to become the gimmick.
Right.

200
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,270
Instead of having to live.
You don't have to turn it on and off.

201
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,500
Yeah.
I'm the other way,

202
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:17,501
I've,
I've gone out of my way to kill the 

203
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:19,271
gimmick,
which really it actually hurts business 

204
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:22,240
and people get mad at me because they 
wanted to know they want the fantasy 

205
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,490
guy,
but I can't live like that.

206
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,060
It's impossible for me.
So they want you to be almost like a 

207
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,650
caricature,
like a Moody Salads,

208
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,520
rumbling a,
you know,

209
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,610
whatever,
you know.

210
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:36,611
That's why a lot of this stuff on me 
that's clickbait is based on the 

211
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:38,600
character that I both created and people
want me to play.

212
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,900
Wow.
That's like one of the biggest memes of 

213
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,581
last year.
It was about a year ago was like me at 

214
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:45,581
Disneyland.
I don't know if you've heard about that.

215
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:49,211
So it's classic.
I was on a ride and somebody took a 

216
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:53,861
picture of me on the ride and for 
whatever reason I just don't look happy 

217
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:53,861
at that particular moment.
And I got this great,

218
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,390
this great to infect the guy in the 
room.

219
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:58,860
My tour manager Jug was the guy sitting 
next to me in the photo and a.

220
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,550
There you go look.
And it was like massive viral,

221
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,570
like that's perfect.

222
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,940
And I had a great date,
like I met,

223
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,820
I met,
I met tons of fans,

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
I took pictures with everyone.
I love Disneyland.

225
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,190
I had this great day and that became 
like this massive thing of like see,

226
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:20,040
he's miserable even at Disneyland.
That's hilarious.

227
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,570
That's funny.
What a perfect picture.

228
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:21,980
Right?
Right.

229
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,440
So,
and even ended up on family guy say,

230
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,770
look,
that's very funny man.

231
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,050
That's very funny.
That's got to be exhausting.

232
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,420
Like having all these expectations that 
aren't necessarily,

233
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:35,610
that don't totally aligned with who you 
really are.

234
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,690
A,
it used to be because I felt like I 

235
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,220
dunno is the keeper of my image or 
something.

236
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:46,221
I felt this responsibility to sort of 
manage it and that's when I just let it 

237
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:46,221
go.
No,

238
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,670
well,
sorry to interrupt you,

239
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,610
but it's like at some point I decided 
crazy was better for business.

240
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,400
Like I'm okay with people thinking.

241
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:52,730
No,
it's,

242
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,160
it's totally okay because I'm the exact 
opposite of nuts.

243
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,560
You have to be.
You're certainly eccentric.

244
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,910
Yeah,
that's fine.

245
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,010
You know,
I come from a long line of eccentrics.

246
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:06,120
I mean my father was a drug dealing gun 
toting musician.

247
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,180
Was It really madman?
Yeah,

248
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,780
yeah.
Drug dealing.

249
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,160
Oh yeah.
What kind of drugs?

250
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,650
You name it.
Really?

251
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,250
Oh yeah.
Wow.

252
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,040
I mean it's a,
it's a like quick stories.

253
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,740
Like when I was a kid,
my father was a musician,

254
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:24,741
so I remember I used to like,
I wasn't allowed to touch his guitars 

255
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:26,640
but I was allowed to look at them.
So I remember one day I was walking past

256
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:28,740
the bedroom and I saw a guitar case 
under the bed and I was like,

257
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:29,730
oh,
I wonder what that is.

258
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,940
Did he get a new guitar?
So I went and slipped the thing out and 

259
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:34,940
I flipped it open.

260
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,090
It was,
it was a sawed off shotgun in a guitar 

261
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,090
case.
Just lay in there,

262
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,540
you know,
in the house or you know,

263
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,660
I'd go to open something.
It would be like 10 pounds of weed,

264
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:43,840
you know,
it's just this system.

265
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,990
That was the,
that was the world I grew up in.

266
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,300
Where did you grow up?
Outside of Chicago.

267
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,490
About an hour outside.
Wow.

268
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,480
But yeah,
my dad,

269
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,840
my dad got arrested a bunch of times and
massive bus and drug.

270
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:59,841
It's just crazy.
Then got people knocking on the door in 

271
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:00,240
the middle of the night and,
and getting shot at and my dad says he's

272
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:02,880
been shot at nine times.
Never hit.

273
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,770
No,
that's luck.

274
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,640
Stabbed two or three times.
Jesus.

275
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,570
My favorite story with,
uh,

276
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,230
my,
one of my favorite stories,

277
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,790
my father was,
um,

278
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,800
he was doing a drug deal and or he was 
buying drugs and like,

279
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,080
so he stops and wearing the guy got in 
the car and then the guy pulled out a 

280
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,750
gun and stuck it in his ribs in and did 
like give me all your money.

281
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,290
And my dad looked and said,
kill me base because he was unhappy.

282
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,910
So he figured I fucking just,
he said,

283
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,080
just kill me.
And the guy,

284
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,250
the guy flipped out and left the car and
he told you all this.

285
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,920
Oh yeah.
I got a lot of these stories.

286
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,620
Post-Haste yeah.
Is he still around?

287
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,460
Oh yeah.
He's still around.

288
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:45,150
He's still kicking.
What was it for him,

289
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,020
like seeing you as a son?
As a weird thing?

290
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:53,070
Because in the beginning he was very 
dismissive of the music.

291
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,170
Yeah.
He was not supportive of me playing the 

292
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,170
guitar.
He and my father was a great musician.

293
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,900
I mean,
I mean that with great sincerity.

294
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:03,901
My father was truly talented and I'm in 
the beginning he was not supportive at 

295
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:07,000
all,
didn't want me to play the guitar,

296
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,150
didn't want me involved in music.
And even after I put out my first album,

297
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,510
which went on to be at the time was like
the most successful independent album 

298
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:15,510
ever released.

299
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,440
So it wasn't like an insignificant 
moment in my life.

300
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,240
My Dad would just kind of shrugged her 
shoulders,

301
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:20,050
was like,
it's okay,

302
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:20,770
you know,
it was like,

303
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,900
what are you talking about?
Like wow,

304
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,400
you know,
if you know,

305
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:27,010
my earliest guitar heavy,
there's cool stuff,

306
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,480
Solos.
And he was just like,

307
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,490
yeah,
it wasn't until my second album in the 

308
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,941
band blew up.
Then he started kind of changed his 

309
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:35,941
tune.
Then he became more supportive.

310
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:39,751
Then he got really weirdly jealous who.
And then he started doing weird things 

311
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:40,180
like he call me and it'd be like,
um,

312
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,320
if you need me to write you any songs,
like I'm like number one.

313
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,420
And he's like,
he's asking me to write songs.

314
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:51,421
It was so weird,
but then he was also a lot of drugs and 

315
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:51,421
so there was that,
you know,

316
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:53,740
there's that interweave of like and 
weird stuff like,

317
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,700
you know,
um,

318
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,800
you know,
one day he calls me and he's like,

319
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,100
my dad always played this cool 19,
64,

320
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:00,940
purple flying b.

321
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,730
That was like his guitar,
you know,

322
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,120
and my,
my dad,

323
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:06,130
to me it was like a star and he still is
in my mind.

324
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:07,280
So,
um,

325
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,900
he told me one day,
you know,

326
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,500
when I die,
I'm going to give you my guitar.

327
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,390
And then fast forward four years later,
he calls me up.

328
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:13,770
He's like,
yeah,

329
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:15,070
I'm gonna.
Put this guitar and Ebay.

330
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,900
So he said,
you do you want to buy it?

331
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,150
No,
I had to buy the guitar.

332
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,610
You're supposed to get what he does.
Yeah.

333
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,770
Fuck yeah.
It's just weird stuff like that.

334
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:25,780
It's been a lot of that.
So anybody who's grown up in that,

335
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,700
those types of situations,
it's not talking about.

336
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:32,701
It's like wacky world.
You're never quite sure what angle was 

337
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:35,341
going on because the need for money,
depending on what situation is going on,

338
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:37,780
you know?

339
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,100
Yeah.
But you weren't reinforced.

340
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,380
You reinforce this idea that I've always
had that.

341
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:45,230
Everyone that I know that's interesting 
came from a fucked up childhood.

342
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,980
I couldn't argue against it.
It's hard because.

343
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,320
Do you have children?
I have one son.

344
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:51,740
Yeah.
He's.

345
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,930
He's just going to be too.
It's for me,

346
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:54,770
it's,
it's so.

347
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:00,070
It's a conflict because I take care of 
my kids and I'm around and I give him a 

348
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:05,050
lot of love there.
Not fucked up and I'm like,

349
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,110
my kid's going to be boring.
I think all of my friends,

350
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,380
all of them come from fucked up 
household chaos and they created the 

351
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:16,520
pressure.
Created these diamonds.

352
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Yeah.
There's something to be said for the 

353
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,010
adversity and my dad would even say to 
me weird things like,

354
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,670
it's good you had a fucked up childhood 
because it made you successful.

355
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,970
Yeah.
Thinking like I would have preferred 

356
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:30,970
like Disneyland with you.
You know what I mean?

357
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,880
Maybe I wouldn't have been miserable at 
Disneyland if it wasn't for you dad.

358
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,920
Man,
I think your story's amazing though.

359
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:42,950
I mean,
I know it probably sucked growing up 

360
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:42,950
like that,
but damn,

361
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,851
to be able to tell everybody your dad 
was his guitar playing tote and drug 

362
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:51,470
deal in psycho.
I mean that's a bad ass story.

363
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,130
Yeah,
there's

364
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,110
this.
I think you'll appreciate this in the,

365
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,230
in the gangster tradition.
So there was this thing that happened 

366
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,900
when I was probably about 10 or 12 where
there was a local club and you know,

367
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,080
and my dad played there all the time and
I came back to the House one day and the

368
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,380
house was full of just like smokey 
equipment,

369
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,300
like you could smell like smoke,
fire.

370
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,130
And,
and he said,

371
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,300
Oh,
the club burned down.

372
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,640
And so they had ran in the fire or 
retrieve the gear,

373
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,660
some kind of story like that.
And so that was the story for years was 

374
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,021
he was eating across the street pancakes
at four in the morning and saw the club 

375
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:26,900
burned down.
Years later I heard the real story.

376
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:30,140
He was in a car with a chick doing 
whatever,

377
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,740
and he saw some mob guy walk in the club
with gasoline,

378
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,520
light the club on fire,
so he knew it was arson,

379
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:42,521
but because he knew it was mob related,
he couldn't say anything and that's 

380
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:46,240
like,
that's like every story is like there's 

381
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,240
the real story and the story I got when 
I was a kid,

382
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,230
so he ran into the fire just to get 
equipment.

383
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,630
Yeah,
I think he ran in and got his guitar.

384
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,680
He was able to save his guitar and then.
And then.

385
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,770
And then of course the police came and 
questioned him because they knew he had 

386
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,920
was there on the scene or something.
And of course he said I didn't see 

387
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,760
anything because he didn't want to die 
because of Chicago with the mob.

388
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:08,510
I mean,
forget about it.

389
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:12,020
Especially back then in the seventies,
it was like they ran the town,

390
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,180
they got Kennedy elected.
Well,

391
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,000
yeah,
I mean that.

392
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,570
I mean,
the stories about Chicago are legendary.

393
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,180
You know what I mean?
Like people used to come to Chicago back

394
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,260
in the day.
It's a little bit different now.

395
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,030
People come,
PAC man,

396
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,930
the city is so clean,
it's so organized.

397
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:24,390
It's like,
yeah,

398
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:26,920
because it's run by,
you know,

399
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,580
Capo is all over the city.
You know,

400
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:30,230
every ward had its capo and

401
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,290
yes to Congo has is uniquely violent 
history and even to this day with,

402
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,360
with what's going on in the south side 
with all the gangs,

403
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,180
it's,
it's,

404
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,980
it's shocking to me as somebody who was 
born in Chicago,

405
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:47,981
I still live in Chicago,
that it's just like we've normalized 

406
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:50,030
this insane violence in our,
in this community.

407
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,370
We don't even realize.
I think most people have no idea how 

408
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:55,370
much gun violence

409
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:55,830
those I heard the other day.
I could,

410
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,020
I could be wrong and I'm sure you can 
find,

411
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:01,650
but I think somebody said the other day,
there's been 3,700

412
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:06,651
shootings in Chicago already this year 
and I think we're already over 600 gun 

413
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,730
fatalities and this isn't like every 
year now.

414
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,650
Wow.
I mean I just,

415
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,740
and even trump at some point flooded out
like maybe they should bring the 

416
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:15,740
national guard.
I wish they would do something.

417
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,220
I just.
Such a dis generational tragedy that 

418
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,760
just keeps going and nothing seems to 
happen.

419
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Yeah.
And it seems to have a lot of momentum 

420
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,100
behind it.
Like the murders they,

421
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,930
they've,
they make people have revenge murders 

422
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,261
and then it just piles on top of each 
other and it doesn't seem like there's 

423
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:34,410
any,
any stopping it inside.

424
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,450
Well,
here's the thing,

425
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,700
and this is the classic tale.
Now.

426
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,910
It was reported the other day that the 
car jackings in Chicago have gone up 

427
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,851
like 200 percent and now those 
carjackings are filtering into the nice 

428
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:46,340
neighborhoods.
Uh,

429
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,040
so now you're gonna start seeing some 
action because now,

430
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,010
now

431
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,410
it's blowing up past the sort of,
you know,

432
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,640
I mean,
look at that,

433
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,790
the shot clock,
a person is shot every two minutes and 

434
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,260
20 seconds a person is murdered every 12
hours.

435
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,330
Oh,
two hours and 20 minutes a person is 

436
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,340
murdered every 12 hours and 23 minutes.
That's a lot.

437
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,570
Wow.
I mean,

438
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,340
it's my home and I just,
you know,

439
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,030
I have a.
I'm a guy that I met when I was down 

440
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,030
there.
He was a driver.

441
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,000
He drove us around and he was saying 
that uh,

442
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:24,390
he used to be a cop and that would 
happen was they arrested some of the top

443
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:29,391
level drug dealers.
I've heard this exact same story and as 

444
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:29,730
soon as they did that there became this 
power vacuum.

445
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,930
And then for years I got a little 
insight information for years.

446
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:38,190
What I'd heard is that they had this 
sort of like as long as you stay on this

447
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:40,270
side of the street,
we'll kind of,

448
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,680
we'll look the other way for this,
but you got to keep your people in line 

449
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:45,680
over here.

450
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,730
And I know enough people in the PD that,
that was sort of the general 

451
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,461
understanding.
Like even like I remember one time 

452
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:52,461
because I knew somebody who worked in 
the,

453
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:56,310
in the,
in like the gang taskforce as like how 

454
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,060
come there's always whores on the bridge
on Friday night.

455
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,010
Like don't you guys see the 50 whores 
and the bridge?

456
00:18:59,011 --> 00:18:59,910
And they said,
no,

457
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,980
we,
that's where we tell all the horse to go

458
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:07,390
so we can protect them.
We'd rather have them there so we can 

459
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,941
keep an eye on them.
And we know what's going to happen 

460
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,951
anyway so better we control it.
So that was the way Chicago started 

461
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,780
operated was like we'll tolerate crime 
up to this level in twice a year.

462
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,620
We'll run everybody in just to Kinda 
make the,

463
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,810
make it look good in the paper.
And then apparently whatever they did 

464
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,720
that created this power vacuum,
that's just what I've heard.

465
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,720
I don't know.
Scott was a former cop and the way he 

466
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:29,820
was describing it was pretty absolute.
He's like,

467
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:31,120
they made a mistake,
the,

468
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,920
this solution that you were saying of 
like kind of like saying,

469
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:37,200
hey,
keep it over here or keep it under wraps

470
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,180
and we'll arrest a certain amount of 
people.

471
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,110
It sounds like maybe that's the only way
to manage it.

472
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Well the one thing I do,
I have heard from people that are in 

473
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,790
those communities is that literally the.
And this may be supports.

474
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:55,791
What you're saying is that the,
the power divisions are like block the 

475
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,541
block.
So it's almost like an insurgency where 

476
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,770
it's like two blocks versus two blocks 
versus one block versus three blocks.

477
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,620
So literally if you're walking on the 
wrong side of the street,

478
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,810
it's not even like neighborhood to 
neighborhood,

479
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:09,870
it's like block to block,
which is crazy.

480
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,700
And just growing up in that 
neighborhood,

481
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:16,701
having that be your normal as a child 
and then growing into adulthood around 

482
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:23,091
that and having just used to people 
getting shot used to shooting people 

483
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:27,291
you.
I mean if there's that many people 

484
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:27,291
getting shot and that many gunshots 
going off,

485
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,820
everybody must be common.
I mean it must be common everyone.

486
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,590
Yeah.
I don't know.

487
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,750
It's just crazy.
That's just heartbreaking.

488
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,020
It's such a unique town too.
It's an amazing city.

489
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,210
It really is.
Yeah.

490
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,060
I mean we have this weird bare knuckle 
history.

491
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,830
Yeah.
And it's still there,

492
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,610
you know?
No,

493
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,370
no amount of yuppies moving and it's 
changed as sort of working sort of ethos

494
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,540
while you.
It's sort of symbolized by the food that

495
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,110
giant pizza.
Yeah.

496
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:58,240
We like to eat depth pizzas.
Insane.

497
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,460
That what you deliver those pizzas,
by the way.

498
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,090
Did you really?
Yeah,

499
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,020
that was one of my gigs.

500
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,400
I bet it builds your arms up heavy.
What?

501
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,770
First time I ate a Chicago deep dish 
pizza,

502
00:21:07,771 --> 00:21:08,350
I was like,
okay,

503
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,480
is this really a pizza?
Like what do we see?

504
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,190
This is a casserole.
Yeah.

505
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,200
Yeah,
but it's like tardy people too.

506
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,380
It's like there's something about 
Chicago that seems to me to have like 

507
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,400
the momentum of the old days still 
deeply entrenched in it,

508
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,840
whereas that doesn't seem the case in La
and a lot of other big cities.

509
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,080
Yeah.
It's just like kind of weird Yuppy yuppy

510
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:32,850
thing.
I call it yet,

511
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:33,910
but I don't know what you want to call 
it,

512
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:37,870
but if it's like South Park did that 
episode where it's like,

513
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,610
it's not like once the whole foods moves
in like everyone's supposed to live a 

514
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,230
certain way.
Did you see that episode?

515
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,490
But it's like this funny bit about like 
how the whole foods sort of anchors down

516
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:49,720
this new way of life.

517
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,430
Some kind of like,
you know,

518
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,450
riff on that said it does.
I bet it does in some way.

519
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,630
Yeah.
So it's this idea of sort of like a,

520
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,040
you can drop this homogenous idea of 
what modern cultures like in any place 

521
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,090
and it will just sort of riff out like a
spore.

522
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:12,150
Yeah.
It's like we've got the whole foods and 

523
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,150
we've got the,
you know,

524
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,540
the starbucks and,
and now we're all going to be nice to 

525
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:15,730
each other or something.
It's like a weird,

526
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,210
you know what I mean?
Like we're all just going to start 

527
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:21,210
behaving better because,
you know,

528
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,000
whatever.
I think I understand the joke.

529
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,110
No,
I do,

530
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,520
you know,
I think uh,

531
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,670
but again saying your environment that 
you grew up in this chaos and then 

532
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,300
coming from Chicago and coming from,
you know,

533
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,970
the stories you're telling about your 
dad that had to contribute to like the,

534
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,140
the deepness and intensity of your 
music.

535
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,080
Right?
I Dunno,

536
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,110
I,
I certainly revolted against suburban 

537
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,110
life.
Yeah.

538
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,630
I mean the suburban life of that world.
It's just,

539
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,460
I just,
I just couldn't take it.

540
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,810
Yeah,
man.

541
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,270
Just couldn't take it.
The mall,

542
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,510
the mall,
the Strip mall vibe,

543
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:56,560
whatever.
That was just a rat in a cage,

544
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:57,370
right?
Yeah.

545
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:57,630
Well,
the,

546
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,650
well,
the great thing is then I traded one 

547
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:02,650
imprisonment suburbia for,
you know,

548
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,830
rock and roll aesthetics and you know,
who's,

549
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,370
who gets to say who is integral and you 
know,

550
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,450
who's cool and not cool.
Oh my God.

551
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:15,451
That would,
that drove me insane to WHO's selling 

552
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:15,451
out.
Yeah.

553
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:16,640
I mean the first line of um,
uh,

554
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:23,300
uh,
the first line of our second album is 

555
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,470
freak out and given it doesn't matter 
what you believe in,

556
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,340
you know,
it's like,

557
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,820
you know,
it's like you gotta you gotTa play by 

558
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,680
now you've got to play by these rules.
You've got to kiss this ring and you 

559
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,500
know,
it's just music.

560
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:37,510
So He's,
the weird thing too is that people 

561
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,510
really enjoy you when they're the only 
ones who know about you.

562
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,580
And then as you started getting bigger 
and bigger,

563
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,070
they start looking for holes.
Yeah,

564
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,280
we blew that up early though.

565
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,370
We believe that we glued up really 
early.

566
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,950
We made a lot of enemies really early,
which is crazy because,

567
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:53,951
I mean,
the enemies I made in the early 

568
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:53,951
nineties,
I mean,

569
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:53,951
I still have them.
I mean they're still sort of lurking out

570
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,730
there in various holes.
It's weird.

571
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,640
He's like those,
those,

572
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,870
those,
you know,

573
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,850
inner seen rivalries never end,
you know,

574
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,940
between bands or.
It's like I've had weird experiences 

575
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,110
with like people not with Nirvana people
but like people who were in the nirvana 

576
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:17,171
world.
There's still like this weird like 

577
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:20,400
because I'm from Pumpkin World,
like pee out sometimes I'll have weird 

578
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,780
stuff happen and I'll dig down and find 
out.

579
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:25,781
It was like somebody who used to work in
Nirvana world trying to cut my ankles 27

580
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:27,920
years later.
Like so weird.

581
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,130
Like so parochial.
The whole Nirvana scene is a very 

582
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:33,130
strange scene.
You know,

583
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:38,130
whenever the main guy commit suicide and
this oddly conspiratorial way,

584
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,700
did you watch that fucked up movie 
that's now a lot of people don't know.

585
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,980
I was sort of around for a lot of that 
stuff.

586
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:49,370
So I know a lot of stuff that I've never
sort of talked about.

587
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,860
So for me watching that stuff is like,
it's a,

588
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:53,830
it's replaying something I don't want to
replay.

589
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,850
And B,
I know a lot of the stuff is not based 

590
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,601
on fact because I was around for a lot 
of it and no one's ever talked to me 

591
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,200
about it.
So people tried to pimp me out like in a

592
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,440
q and a with fans and asked me questions
like I'm suddenly going to talk about 

593
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,440
it.
You know what I mean?

594
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,940
Yeah.
That,

595
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,100
that documentary was so strange.
It was like,

596
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:12,770
how does someone get it

597
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,660
way with that?
Like the recreation's,

598
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,540
like if you weren't there,
you don't know what the fuck they said.

599
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,660
So if you don't know what the fuck they 
said and you're putting words in these 

600
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,030
actors' mouths and having them play it 
out like you're just this,

601
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,020
this should be illegal because you're 
kind of.

602
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,300
You know what I'm saying?
It's like your car,

603
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,560
especially when you're talking about a 
murder mystery,

604
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,420
you're,
you're,

605
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,830
you're,
you're saying that it wasn't a suicide.

606
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:34,260
You're,
you're,

607
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:39,350
you're at least putting out the idea 
that it might be a murderer the way 

608
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,820
you're doing it.
And it's by manufacturing words that you

609
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:44,030
have no idea if they were ever say it's 
complete fiction.

610
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:44,150
Yeah,
yeah,

611
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,230
yeah,
so like,

612
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,720
that's,
I,

613
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,460
I,
I,

614
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,250
I was around for the before sorta during
and,

615
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,040
and certainly a lot after and I know a 
lot of stuff that again,

616
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:57,170
I know is not in the public domain and 
so I,

617
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,010
I go with what I know.
Right.

618
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,420
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

619
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,520
But it's,
that whole nirvana thing was.

620
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,730
I mean,
I remember the first time I heard 

621
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,021
Nirvana,
I was a kid in Boston and this buddy of 

622
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:12,270
mine played it for us and we were,
we'd never heard anything like that.

623
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,050
We were like,
Whoa,

624
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,640
yeah,
I,

625
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,170
this,
this thing just fantastic.

626
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,230
A new thing,
right.

627
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,300
Like a new,
like here's a crazy little Boston 

628
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:22,300
statistic for you.
We weren't played,

629
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,290
it was nirvana,
pumpkin's and bullet Lavolta we played 

630
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,851
at that little club.
It was like an art club across from 

631
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:30,851
fenway.
I can't remember what it's called.

632
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:32,360
Access or,
right.

633
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,600
Yeah,
but you know what I'm talking about.

634
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,190
But yeah,
we played there like,

635
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,520
I don't know,
92 wasn't even sold out.

636
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,300
Oh Wow.
It's like 700 people kind of thing.

637
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,980
That's seven people with an awesome

638
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,660
story.
Yeah.

639
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:45,120
Yeah,
right.

640
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,970
Wow.
So you're,

641
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,030
you're working with Rick Rubin now?
Yeah.

642
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,100
That's awesome.
Eric's fantastic.

643
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,800
Is that like though for you being like a
guy who's Kinda like,

644
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,650
you kinda controlled everything before,
right?

645
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,310
Yeah,
totally.

646
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,860
So what is it like for you to have Ruben
in the mix and.

647
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,540
Yeah,
well rick's of friends.

648
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:10,541
So for me it was like I was sort of at a
low point and he kind of picked me up 

649
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:14,031
when I was down so it was like I didn't 
mind sort of trusting him with like the 

650
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:17,901
head part of it all kind of like you 
deal with that part and I'm just going 

651
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:20,910
to sort of be up to the performer and 
the weird guy in the corner and give you

652
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:21,990
relief.
Oh yeah,

653
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:27,110
yeah.
I felt like it allowed me to focus on 

654
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,480
the music and the performance and Sorta 
just freed me to just,

655
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,760
you know,
whatever.

656
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,010
Because sometimes you can psych yourself
out.

657
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,400
I don't know if that makes any sense.
Like you can have a really good song,

658
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:40,401
you know,
it's a good song and then you start 

659
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:40,401
second guessing yourself and they start 
thinking,

660
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:41,790
well maybe this song is not good enough,
and then that'll,

661
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,210
that'll infiltrate into your performance
as opposed to being free.

662
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:45,530
Like,
Hey,

663
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,880
I've just got a good song and if that 
one doesn't work,

664
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:52,881
I've got another good song.
So letting rick kind of do the picking 

665
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,570
and choosing and that's a good take and 
that's a good song.

666
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:55,260
It was just like,
okay,

667
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:56,940
I'm just going to kind of just go down 
this road.

668
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,500
It took me back to sort of a more 
innocent way of approaching the work and

669
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:03,660
I'm very grateful to him for that.
That's awesome.

670
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Yeah.
It's got to be quite a mind fuck to 

671
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,361
create something and then practice it 
and rehearse it over and over again and 

672
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:13,170
tweak it and mess with it and not know 
really,

673
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:18,171
like not,
not almost not be able to be objective 

674
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:18,171
anymore.

675
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:19,140
Yeah.
Well the weird thing is is I hope people

676
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,010
can appreciate it.
How.

677
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:22,820
I mean,
it is like at one point when I.

678
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,740
my ear was really at the ground,
I was able to do that.

679
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:28,170
I was able to be objective and 
subjective,

680
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,100
be the writer and be the producer and I 
hit a lot of home runs,

681
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,230
so then you get kind of like,
I know what I'm doing.

682
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,450
Right?
So then when it stops working,

683
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,960
you have two choices.
You can blame yourself,

684
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,880
which is the natural thing you should 
do,

685
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:46,080
or you can blame others and once you 
start blaming others,

686
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:48,260
now you're in this hall of mirrors.
Yeah.

687
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,070
Yeah.
You know,

688
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,320
instead of raising your hand saying,
okay,

689
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,440
I've had a good run.
Now it's like getting a coach or 

690
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,841
something like maybe a guy goes on a 
losing streak and need spring in a new 

691
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:02,721
coach to say,
I think you need to work on your 

692
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:02,721
offense.

693
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:02,721
You know what I mean?
Just somebody to tweak you.

694
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:06,730
Yeah.
But when you're flying a thousand miles 

695
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,440
an hour and you're selling gazillions of
records and making all this money and 

696
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:09,440
you're surrounded by a bunch of sick 
fence,

697
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,650
they're not going to tell you,
hey man,

698
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:11,670
you need,
you need,

699
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:16,690
you know,
you needed the doctor to come in and 

700
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:16,690
kind of search,
search,

701
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:16,690
head out.
Yeah.

702
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,721
So then you start going this way and 
then that's when it gets like hall of 

703
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:20,721
Mirrors.
So that's where,

704
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:22,170
that's where my own Hubris sorta gotten 
my own way.

705
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,870
I couldn't accept that I got on a losing
streak and then,

706
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,730
you know,
go to somebody like rick and say,

707
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,770
I need some help.
I need some objective help.

708
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:30,210
I'm.
Did you feel yourself,

709
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,490
like when you were listening to the 
music that you were creating,

710
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:34,200
did you feel like you were on a losing 
streak?

711
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,540
No.
No I couldn't.

712
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,450
I couldn't.
I couldn't intellectually understand why

713
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:41,500
I was failing.
It didn't make any sense to me.

714
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,800
And sometimes it's just generational.
It's the market changes,

715
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:46,150
whatever.
It's not personal.

716
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:51,570
It feels incredibly personal,
which is why it's easier to blame 

717
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,840
somebody else.
Like you don't understand the depth of 

718
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:54,840
my,
my work here,

719
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,700
I'm so deep and you know,
you're not following my,

720
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,140
my met a path or say,
you know what I mean?

721
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,310
And look,
it's most,

722
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,260
most entertainment is popular,
right?

723
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:03,610
I mean you're,
you're a comedian.

724
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:08,611
I mean it's like if you get them to tell
a bunch of jokes and the audience 

725
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:08,611
doesn't laugh,
whose fault is it?

726
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:08,611
Well,
the,

727
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:13,190
the mindfuck of music to me has always 
been very fascinating because you guys 

728
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,461
create it in like a vacuum or totally.
And then you bring it into the people.

729
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:21,400
Like when you release an album,
they get it and it's done.

730
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,480
It's like,
Holy Shit,

731
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:23,890
here it is.
And you know,

732
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,950
big fan plays it for the first time and 
they're listening to it that I go on it 

733
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,040
like it's,
it's all.

734
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,380
Whereas we have ideas and I need an 
audience to create like I need to be 

735
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,700
around them.
I can't,

736
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I can only create so much on a laptop.
Most of it has to be like fine tuned.

737
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:45,520
And so by the time I record something 
already,

738
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,920
no.
Yeah,

739
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,110
it's already been tested,
right,

740
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,410
so that's.
Go back to my point,

741
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,780
if you get on a winning streak and 
you're,

742
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:57,890
you're creating things in a bubble and 
then they work well then you want to 

743
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,800
take all the credit for it.
You forget all the thousand hours in the

744
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:03,160
bedroom that you listen to Jimi Hendrix 
or you know,

745
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,260
Bauhaus or merciful fate or whatever you
know,

746
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,120
like that gave you all these ideas.
You,

747
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:08,890
you know,
you don't want to give them credit.

748
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:11,080
You want to be the author of your own 
success.

749
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,970
It starts patting you on the back and

750
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,000
yeah.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

751
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:17,520
I just want to be very introspective in 
that regard.

752
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:18,730
Like you,
you have a very,

753
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,040
I'm a failure with failure would do 
that.

754
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:26,110
Is that when you say failure though,
but you still have massive amounts of 

755
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,110
fans are still

756
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,890
DPA expected?
Yeah,

757
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:27,330
I'm,
I'm,

758
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,310
I'm weird in that I've always been 
willing to talk about the process,

759
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:33,110
which again is anti gimmick,
but also,

760
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,760
um,
uh,

761
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,990
I,
I've always approached it more like a 

762
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,761
performance artist in that I'm after the
bigger message of how work intersects 

763
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:47,581
with fame intersects with personal 
feeling intersects with personality and,

764
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,040
and,
and how people perceive things like I 

765
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,140
like all that weird Andy Kaufman,
uncomfortability.

766
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,680
That's part of my attraction.
So I've been willing to use myself as 

767
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,350
the battering ram,
which is how I ended up becoming a meme,

768
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,170
right?
Because people,

769
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,630
people latch onto these personalities 
I've created,

770
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,450
which of course are ancillary to my real
personality,

771
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,700
but they don't.
They don't necessarily want to give me 

772
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:12,700
credit that I'm sort of controller of 
the forces at play.

773
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,160
So if I say something dumb,
people assume that I'm dumb.

774
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,310
It's hard for them to assume that I'm 
saying something dumb on purpose because

775
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,220
I want a reaction.
Yeah.

776
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,450
When you become a hugely successful 
musician and your life becomes touring 

777
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,430
big arenas,
doing radio shows,

778
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,350
getting on the bus,
getting on the plane,

779
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:38,380
all of a sudden,
does it make it difficult to have like

780
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,160
that

781
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:45,190
time or the.
The actual experiences to continue to 

782
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,190
create?

783
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,340
Yes.
Because you get so deoxygenated in the 

784
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,480
bubble that you start writing songs 
about being on tour.

785
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Yeah.
Like comedians will tell jokes about 

786
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:57,640
airline food.
Yeah,

787
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,770
exactly.
You got to becoming sort of like you're 

788
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:02,870
trying to take people in the insularity 
of your experience,

789
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:04,480
but it's not that interesting.
Right?

790
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,100
At some point it becomes unrelatable.
Well,

791
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:09,410
I always said that about like A.
I mean there's,

792
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:12,980
there's a lot of bands,
but some of the great allman brothers or

793
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:17,981
Leonard Skinner,
like they had a bunch of songs about 

794
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:20,270
leaving,
about getting away from women.

795
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,680
You know,
Lord,

796
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:23,990
I was born in rambling man.
So yeah,

797
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,990
there was so many songs about just 
getting away from women.

798
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,610
Yeah.
The other day I heard that crosby,

799
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:29,440
stills,
Nash and song.

800
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,450
It's like just a song before I go.
It's all about he's going on tour and 

801
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,000
they go to the airport and it's 
uncomfortable.

802
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,100
It's like,
it's such a going onto her song.

803
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,210
Yeah.
But it's like,

804
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:41,420
it's really not that relatable to most 
people know to a lot of people.

805
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:42,400
It's not.
Yeah.

806
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,630
I mean,
skinner had a shitload of those.

807
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:50,050
They really did have quite a few songs 
about like getting the fuck out of 

808
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,460
dodge.
They were good.

809
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,590
Such a great band.
Giant fan.

810
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,620
I mean,
they're probably the greatest thing to 

811
00:33:59,620 --> 00:33:59,620
ever come out of Florida.

812
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,250
It's arguable,
you know.

813
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,840
I'm trying to think who else came out of
Florida?

814
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,770
Uh,
Jim Brewer.

815
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,260
I thought we were talking about that 
already.

816
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:14,070
Just talking about music.
I don't have anything else when it comes

817
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:15,570
to music.
Who else?

818
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,480
Pit Bull.
Yeah.

819
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

820
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,860
It's uh,
the,

821
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,010
the.
So do you,

822
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,270
did you feel it while it was happening?
Like when you're,

823
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,740
you're doing these mega tours and 
everything.

824
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:32,160
Do you feel like this staleness and the 
creation?

825
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,230
Um,
I did.

826
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:39,350
Yeah.
I think what I tried to do is change 

827
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,841
personalities,
change musical directions to reinfuse 

828
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:46,040
things.
And it worked up until a point until my 

829
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,870
mother died,
like in 96,

830
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,340
in,
in a,

831
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,920
in a weird three month period.
The drummer left the band,

832
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,960
my mother died and I got a divorce in 
like a six month period.

833
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,650
And so I try to use that as fuel to sort
of pivot where I wanted to go musically.

834
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,890
But I wrote this very introspective,
dark record,

835
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:12,891
which a lot of people really like now.
But at the time it was like so 

836
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:15,630
antithetical to this big rock scene.
Um,

837
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,900
yeah.
And it was castigated for being an 

838
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:20,900
idiot.
And I went from golden child to idiot,

839
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,930
you know,
in one fell swoop.

840
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:22,110
And

841
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,320
well,
so many great artists are a prisoner of 

842
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,900
the early success and rightly so.

843
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:29,730
You know what I mean?
I,

844
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:33,220
I have a much greater appreciation for 
the zeitgeists effect of the public.

845
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,070
Don't know if that makes any sense.
It's like,

846
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,090
it's like how many.
It's like guys,

847
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:42,690
did Elvis have three youtubes,
had two or three.

848
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:45,270
Frank Sinatra had two or three or four.
I mean,

849
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,000
there's something about when it all 
seems to make sense,

850
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:53,001
like the public fascination,
the artists place in time that work 

851
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:56,160
that's being created.
There's a sense of like familiarity,

852
00:35:56,161 --> 00:36:01,161
but also something is happening and 
everybody wants to take part in it and 

853
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:02,070
so I have a much greater appreciation 
for that moment.

854
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,500
The Ego of the artist wants to Vince 
yourself that you're always in that 

855
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
moment and that's just impossible.
That's just impossible.

856
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,530
There's just no way.
It's just the cyclical nature of 

857
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,201
creation.
That's such an important thing to say 

858
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:21,560
for people listening,
for people that struggle with this 

859
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:21,560
themselves.

860
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,740
Here's something like you say that.
Yeah,

861
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:24,570
it's.
It's actually kind of makes sense.

862
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:25,440
It's like,
it's like,

863
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:30,590
it's like a typical example.
It's like falling in love and expecting 

864
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,850
to feel that feeling forever.
It's just not gonna happen.

865
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,890
You're not going to feel the same.
No.

866
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,810
I would argue if you are,
there's something wrong,

867
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:41,850
right?
You haven't matured into a deeper 

868
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,681
relationship,
so in the same thing an artist needs to 

869
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:48,110
mature into a deeper relationship with 
their work or their relationship with 

870
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,110
the public or their relationship with 
themselves.

871
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,910
And if you can do that and you look at 
great examples.

872
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,890
Johnny cash,
Neil Young,

873
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:56,850
Tom Petty when they get there,
everybody comes back,

874
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,470
Bob Dylan because they think,
okay,

875
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,510
now you're giving me some new 
information.

876
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,810
This isn't just a riff on the thing that
you gave me before.

877
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,260
And um,
and I think the public has shown over 

878
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,990
time the willingness and the ability to 
follow artists if they're willing,

879
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:15,130
if they're,
if they're able to go to that place 

880
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,990
where they might not something new that 
actually is like a cultural contribution

881
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:17,850
and not just sort of more of what they 
already know.

882
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,370
I think that's so important for you to 
talk about it.

883
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:25,371
I'm so glad you do because for a 
upcoming artists and in all sorts of 

884
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:30,590
genres,
just people who were involved in 

885
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,110
creating the here,
someone as successful as yourself,

886
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:33,850
talk about the various struggles of the 
mind and,

887
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,200
and have momentum and the,
you know,

888
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,090
the different stages and various points 
of your career.

889
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,440
So important.
Yeah.

890
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:45,441
The music meant his business plays this 
jet I mind trick on you where the whole 

891
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:48,390
thing set up to be patient and take 
advantage of your weakness.

892
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,370
How so?
Well,

893
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,330
it's like,
um,

894
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,190
I,
I can use,

895
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:58,210
I'll use the music businesses and 
example and I'm sure there's plenty of 

896
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,210
parallels across the entertainment 
spectrum.

897
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,660
Um,
you,

898
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,640
you,
you,

899
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:02,790
you struggled to get the contract and 
then the contract is sort of,

900
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,850
you know,
the indirect indentured servitude type 

901
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:07,850
of thing.

902
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,100
We,
our first contract was seven albums,

903
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,380
essentially 14 years.
So I signed that contract when I was 23.

904
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,520
That's crazy.
Okay.

905
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:19,521
So I'm signing a 23 years old and we 
signed a contract that's supposed to 

906
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:22,431
take me into 37.
You'd signing a contract for more than 

907
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:25,440
half your life and if you look at the 
shelf life of most artists,

908
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:30,441
it's for to.
So they're basically anticipating your 

909
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,470
entire arc.
That's so crazy.

910
00:38:31,471 --> 00:38:33,570
You don't have any leverage,
you know,

911
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:35,070
other than that,
they want to sign you.

912
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,740
He signed the deal and then it becomes 
this weird dance of like,

913
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,420
can I sustain success?
Yeah.

914
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,140
If you get success and you have 
leveraged,

915
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:46,210
they'll get out of your way because 
you're making them a lot of money,

916
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:48,370
but the minute you're not making them as
much money,

917
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,370
then they step in and they start playing
these Jedi mind tricks on you.

918
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:56,970
We know.
What do you know the public's gonna 

919
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:56,970
forget about you.
I mean,

920
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,030
I've heard all these things like,
you know,

921
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,740
this kind of weird like,
yeah,

922
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:01,570
you're in the room,
but you know,

923
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,270
we're the arbiter of whether you can 
stay in the room.

924
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:10,390
That's the weird position that record 
companies had for a long time that they 

925
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,390
don't seem to have anymore.

926
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,130
My wouldn't.
I would argue against that because they 

927
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,971
will do well.
They've moved to a different set of 

928
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:17,260
circumstances and I'm not as conversant 
as I as I once was,

929
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:20,530
but one thing they do with certain 
younger artists,

930
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:25,531
but I think particularly more in the pop
realm as they do these three 60 deals 

931
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:25,810
where it's like if you get a perfume 
deal,

932
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:30,640
if you like your whole world,
we owned a piece of your whole world and

933
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:33,430
famous such a great quotion in American 
life.

934
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:38,431
Now that you can see where kids would 
trade fame and give and be willing to 

935
00:39:38,431 --> 00:39:40,840
give away,
like the the profit part will.

936
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:41,920
They'll take a risk

937
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,640
at the long term ownership.

938
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,040
Right?
So let me jump in there.

939
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,610
So if you actually survived the cut,
let's say,

940
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:52,040
let's call it phase one,
you're successful,

941
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:55,490
you're a name and now you're in a place 
to either renegotiate or your deal is up

942
00:39:55,491 --> 00:40:00,491
or whatever.
I once had a conversation with a very 

943
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:00,890
powerful music executive and I said,
and I was friends with the guy,

944
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:03,650
so I was like,
give me the insider psychology here.

945
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Now that I know the game that you run,
what do you tell people like me when 

946
00:40:10,281 --> 00:40:12,920
they get here and he says,
oh,

947
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,690
it's just,
there's always a price.

948
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,530
So they know that even if you get 
through the matrix of the whole thing 

949
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,920
and get off the other side,
that there's just a dollar amount that 

950
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:23,920
will buy you back in.
Whoa.

951
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,130
They're not worried that you'll go 
independent.

952
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:30,670
And in fact if you look at a lot of the 
machinations of the music business over 

953
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,731
the last 20 years,
especially with the rise of the 

954
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,801
Internet,
it's to keep people in the system yet 

955
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:36,050
they don't want true independence.

956
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,160
Right?
But it seems like,

957
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,270
look,
I'll give you a look no further than the

958
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:44,630
deals that the record labels cut with 
the streaming services.

959
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,110
They got into ownership equity deals 
with the streaming services in an,

960
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,220
in an,
in an arrangement for them to have an 

961
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,141
equity position.
They agreed to very low rates for the 

962
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:56,141
artist's music.
Ah,

963
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:56,840
so,
so when you,

964
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:01,040
when you listen to Bob Dylan Song on 
spotify,

965
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,560
Bob Dylan's not getting a lot of money 
for that,

966
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,280
but as spotify and the other streaming 
services raise up in their equity 

967
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,650
position,
the labels benefit.

968
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:14,950
So the labels pimped out their own 
artists to take a greater equity 

969
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:17,030
position in a rising business.
It's like,

970
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,860
you see what I'm saying?
Yeah.

971
00:41:18,861 --> 00:41:23,861
They weakened the artist's position to 
take a better position at the table 

972
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:23,861
themselves.

973
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:24,150
That is fascinating.
And they,

974
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:29,151
they weakened the monetary position of 
compensation in order to get equity in 

975
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:29,410
the company.

976
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,220
Right?
And now,

977
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:34,490
and now you see it where a metallica's 
management for example,

978
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:35,360
has come out.
And,

979
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:35,800
and,
uh,

980
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:36,880
especially,
uh,

981
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,260
Youtube,
former manager Paul mcguinness come out,

982
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,700
they're trying to take on youtube now 
because youtube has got this weird funky

983
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:48,200
position where they'll pay on licensed 
music but they won't pay for covers.

984
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:50,630
And you know what I mean?
Youtube.

985
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:52,340
So like one of the big targets of the 
business,

986
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:56,420
because whatever deal they agreed to 
with youtube 10 years ago is super weak.

987
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:57,350
And,
but again,

988
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:02,351
these are all machinations that go on 
above the artists spot and quick thing 

989
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,220
into your,
into your world.

990
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,410
When Mcgregor leaped out and did the 
fight with mayweather,

991
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,210
he creates this whole different set of 
dynamics because he's,

992
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,870
he can,
he can run his own game.

993
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,790
Yes.
UFC can't pay him.

994
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:21,791
That kind of money.
And last I heard is like maybe it's 

995
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:21,791
going to do another fight.
So I'm not,

996
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:26,200
I don't want to get totally into that.
But my point is as you see where those 

997
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,300
dynamics,
where people step outside the system,

998
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:28,820
it changes the game.
So it's actually kind of,

999
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,560
you could now,
now,

1000
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,720
and I don't want to,
you know,

1001
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,840
I've never met Dana White,
but if Dana white could go back in a 

1002
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:36,840
time machine,
maybe he'd pay mayweather,

1003
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,820
Mcgregor more money to keep them in his 
world because now that he's out,

1004
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,770
I don't think connor would have accepted
that.

1005
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,170
Okay.
But I,

1006
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,090
you recognize the unique opportunity 
that he's in.

1007
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,060
So he probably wasn't any upon talking 
about stuff as a fan,

1008
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,180
the other side of fence.
But my point is,

1009
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:56,080
is when you see,
when somebody breaks out of this sort of

1010
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:58,810
the matrix of how the game is set up,
right,

1011
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,290
it creates this weird thing.

1012
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:06,830
Yeah.
And they have a few today though that 

1013
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,631
have kind of figured it out through 
youtube and all these different online 

1014
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:08,631
chance.
The rapper,

1015
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:12,861
I don't know much about his business,
but I know he's sort of worked out this 

1016
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:14,080
other model for himself that Jamie knows
a lot about them.

1017
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,030
I know he's getting money from a way 
other places than just the traditional a

1018
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,260
record contract.
Big deals from major companies like 

1019
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:24,260
sprite another and he's still 
independent,

1020
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,250
right?
Tech technical word.

1021
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:28,350
They would use to monitor him.
Like he's an independent artist,

1022
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:31,020
but he's got a Michigan behind them.
So I don't know if he's independent,

1023
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:36,021
you know,
I'm good friends with Sturgill Simpson 

1024
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:38,541
and sturgeons tried to educate me as to 
how the record business people in,

1025
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:44,100
in the fold with the owning your 
merchandise and your likeness forever 

1026
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:47,070
and all these different things.
It seems.

1027
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,070
It seems crazy.
We actually,

1028
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,520
we actually signed a clause.
It is.

1029
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:58,590
It said in this contract pertains to 
this universe in any universe,

1030
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:00,730
not yet discovered.

1031
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:06,680
What would we signed that clause?
Who wrote that?

1032
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,620
The record company.
Jesus fucking what do they scientology.

1033
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,050
That is crazy.
Like we literally had a sign

1034
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:17,130
thinking it was like this contract 
pertains to this known universe and any 

1035
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:17,580
universe.
Not yet.

1036
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:17,580
I

1037
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,080
discovered that is fucking insane.
That is insane.

1038
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Like if someone found a parallel 
universe somewhere and they figured out 

1039
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,820
they could sell music to them,
it's apparel.

1040
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,620
They haven't heard the smashing pumpkins
get over there quick shoot a rocket ship

1041
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:32,370
filled with cash

1042
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,330
over there that,
you know,

1043
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:36,270
why they put that in is because the,
when,

1044
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,330
when they transitioned to cds,
the contracts didn't account for cds and

1045
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:44,320
what they did,
it was a very uh,

1046
00:44:44,321 --> 00:44:49,321
it's a very classic thing is.
So they had to go back and renegotiate 

1047
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:51,210
all the deals because of the CT 
technology.

1048
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,590
This would have been like whatever,
eighties.

1049
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,690
So they went to every artist and they 
said,

1050
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,180
look,
it's this new technology,

1051
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,700
we're not sure it's going to work.
So you've got to take a price cut.

1052
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,780
We're only going to pay you seventy five
cents on the dollar so we could advance 

1053
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,240
the new technology.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1054
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:08,370
They're dirty,
they're dirty.

1055
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:09,840
The spotify thing is dirty.

1056
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,770
The uncomfortable hearing,
how they weaseled that,

1057
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,710
how they negotiated cheap prices for the
performers.

1058
00:45:15,711 --> 00:45:20,711
Then they got an equity position in the 
company so as the company grows because 

1059
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:20,900
they don't have to pay much and they get
all this music,

1060
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:23,720
they get money from that.
That is sneaky.

1061
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,240
Dark fucking.
Hey,

1062
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,170
three d chess shake,
game of thrones,

1063
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:29,180
man.
It is game of thrones,

1064
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,020
but I mean obviously it's,
it's an,

1065
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,210
it's an organism surviving in the face 
of Napster,

1066
00:45:35,211 --> 00:45:36,590
right?
Like napster comes in,

1067
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:39,320
file sharing comes in and they're like,
Holy Shit.

1068
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:44,470
Okay,
so the Internet is just out there wild 

1069
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:44,470
and free and you can just download the 
music.

1070
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:48,581
That music is now digital.
We can't control it and it's just going 

1071
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:52,250
and it drives some people crazy.
I had Paul Stanley in here and you can 

1072
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,301
see the fucking anger in his face when 
he's talking about people stealing 

1073
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:55,301
music.
Yeah,

1074
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:55,310
I,
I,

1075
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:00,410
I,
I was one of the first people that came 

1076
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,921
out for napster because I thought the 
music business shit get in bed with 

1077
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:02,800
napster and Ssa,
let the monster grow.

1078
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,750
Right.
I thought they should've brought napster

1079
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:08,020
and house and made it like a given them 
a per whatever.

1080
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,450
Yeah.
But I mean if you want to be technical,

1081
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:14,890
I mean the thing I helped support,
I mean it probably costs me $30,

1082
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:16,210
million,
$40,000,000.

1083
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,500
Napster did.
Yeah,

1084
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,810
that whole world.
Yeah,

1085
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,010
sure.
Yeah,

1086
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,320
yeah.
I would imagine.

1087
00:46:23,321 --> 00:46:24,730
I'm not,
I'm not here to bitch.

1088
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:27,310
It's like the world went on and I'm not 
the only person,

1089
00:46:27,311 --> 00:46:30,580
you know what I'm saying wasn't targeted
at me and I supported it,

1090
00:46:30,581 --> 00:46:31,930
so I got nothing to say,
but I mean,

1091
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,510
yeah,
at some point when you can't pay your,

1092
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,900
you know,
your stupid mortgage on your fifth 

1093
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:39,900
property,
you know,

1094
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:39,970
you know,
sad to Disneyland,

1095
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:41,020
you know what I mean?
It's like,

1096
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,010
I wish I had that money,
but it's a weird dynamic of,

1097
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,290
of the Internet,
of,

1098
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,720
of the free access of information.
And then when a song,

1099
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,690
it's your creation can be boiled down to
information.

1100
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:59,691
It's not that much different than 
forwarding an email in terms of 

1101
00:46:59,691 --> 00:46:59,691
people's.

1102
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,280
The reason I support it in the beginning
was I thought that the free association 

1103
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,781
with music would create a more holistic 
fans finding what they want and that we 

1104
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:16,000
would do well in that ecosystem that 
turned out not to be the case.

1105
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,140
Um,
and I,

1106
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:21,850
I think now that it is sort of set up in
the streaming service world,

1107
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:27,210
now that's starting to be the case 
because people are finding us because 

1108
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:27,550
it's sort of organized and they're sort 
of institutional culture.

1109
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,070
But when it was free wielding,
um,

1110
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,890
I don't think we played the game well 
enough to take advantage of it.

1111
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,140
And,
and a lot of trains just passed us by.

1112
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:40,530
Yeah,
there was a lot of argument that people 

1113
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,091
would find new music because of that in 
a way that they would have never found 

1114
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:46,040
if the record companies and the radio 
stations had a lock down on what got 

1115
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,040
district.

1116
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,640
Somebody did a study.
It's my one piece of empirical evidence 

1117
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,440
like the British,
the British Association of something,

1118
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,680
when it first became a real issue,
did a study about people's fidelity to 

1119
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:04,681
artists,
whether they got something for free or 

1120
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:08,401
they paid for it and they found the 
loyalty was literally know if they got 

1121
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:13,381
it for free,
that the actual act of purchasing 

1122
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:17,461
something created a relationship that 
then created a sort of a desire to want 

1123
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,490
to prove that the relationship was 
profitable.

1124
00:48:21,491 --> 00:48:25,570
In essence,
I buy your your comedy concert.

1125
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:30,930
I didn't get it for free.
It makes me actually assess whether or 

1126
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:33,961
not my.
My thing was a good investment and if 

1127
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:37,141
you prove to me it is,
I become more loyal to you because now 

1128
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:37,141
we're in a relationship.

1129
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:37,760
That makes sense.
Yeah.

1130
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:40,520
Like you want to justify your purchase.
It also makes sense.

1131
00:48:40,521 --> 00:48:45,521
Like when I was coming up and we do 
comedy clubs and they would pay for the 

1132
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:46,910
room and you know,
have a giveaway free tickets.

1133
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,450
Oh God.
Right.

1134
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,910
Audiences were terrible.
They were terrible.

1135
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,700
You would think that people would be 
thankful they got a free show.

1136
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,080
Nope.
They were the worst.

1137
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:59,230
Most unappreciative audiences because 
they didn't have anything invested in 

1138
00:48:59,230 --> 00:48:59,230
it.
That's it.

1139
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,070
It totally makes sense.
So you saw it coming,

1140
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,740
you saw napster coming,
you looked at it and you were like,

1141
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:08,600
this is something that is inevitable.
We should probably figure out a way to

1142
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,810
to.
Yeah,

1143
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:13,470
there's some piece of them.
There's a piece of video me from like 99

1144
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,870
where I say the future of music is 
streaming.

1145
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,170
Yeah.
Damn,

1146
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:18,560
you called it.

1147
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,730
They put me in some documentary.
I haven't seen it,

1148
00:49:20,731 --> 00:49:21,600
but I've heard about it.

1149
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,370
Yeah.
I've always wondered like,

1150
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:26,860
we're not on spotify or would this 
podcast,

1151
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:29,560
but they have.
They have podcasts on it,

1152
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:30,040
but I'm like,
well,

1153
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:31,990
where's the money?
Where's it going?

1154
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,030
Like you,
you want me to be on.

1155
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,350
Right.
But where's,

1156
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,310
where's it going?

1157
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,070
Well,
that's it.

1158
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:41,760
And I usually using Amazon example,
remember for years the wrap on Amazon,

1159
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:46,761
was there not a profitable business?
Nobody could understand because it was 

1160
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:48,600
this new model will now you understand 
that that business model is about,

1161
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,510
uh,
a growing the brand value.

1162
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,940
Yeah.
You know,

1163
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,820
in essence,
if you grow the brand value your,

1164
00:49:56,821 --> 00:49:58,900
your net worth as a,
as a brand.

1165
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:01,200
It far outpaces whether or not you're 
profitable.

1166
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,690
Hm?
Does it make sense?

1167
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:04,470
Yes,
it does.

1168
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,640
So that's part of my argument now with 
music is the brand,

1169
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and I use my brand smashing pumpkins or 
the Nwa is far more valuable than my 

1170
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:19,761
sort of profit loss on paper in the 
world of the open market.

1171
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:26,630
And so as long as you appreciate that,
you won't let people come along and gut 

1172
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,160
out your brand value.
That's a fascinating of looking at it.

1173
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,310
I don't think very many musicians 
probably no,

1174
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:36,311
because they're were surrounded by 
people who are telling them it's a 

1175
00:50:36,311 --> 00:50:37,710
profit loss business full well knowing.
I would argue that they,

1176
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,730
they kind of know deep down to really 
isn't like a.

1177
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,890
let's use a good positive example right 
now.

1178
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:48,460
Gnr reformed,
you know duff and an excellent slash are

1179
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:53,921
out there.
I just saw them at Madison Square 

1180
00:50:53,921 --> 00:50:55,870
Garden.
I mean that's proving to be a very 

1181
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:57,641
durable brand right now.
You could argue how many wrecker,

1182
00:50:58,061 --> 00:51:00,770
if nobody cares anymore,
that's a durable brand.

1183
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,850
The GNR brand or the Harley Davidson 
brand or the Joe Rogan brand,

1184
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:09,851
those are durable brands that,
that are worth far more than you could 

1185
00:51:09,851 --> 00:51:09,851
sort of prove on paper.

1186
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,680
The GNR ones is fascinating.
One to me because actually just went off

1187
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:15,870
the rails and into the woods for so 
long,

1188
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:19,920
shooting his face up with a bunch of 
shit and it looks like he was just gone.

1189
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,690
It looks like we lost him.
Mean to me,

1190
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:23,840
you as a kid.
Guns and roses like.

1191
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,300
I mean they were like welcome to the 
jungle is like one of my all time 

1192
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,420
favorite songs and I was like 18 or 
whatever.

1193
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,070
I old I was.
When it came out,

1194
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:37,071
I mean it was amazing.
And then to see them just have this 

1195
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:39,120
incredible success and then actually 
goes crazy.

1196
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:45,730
But I would argue,
and I don't mean this in a disparaging 

1197
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,581
way,
I would argue that the freedom in axle 

1198
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:52,760
and the path that they took is added to 
the brand.

1199
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,640
I think so too,
because they're back.

1200
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,510
I would argue differently.
I think that when you look,

1201
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,150
and I'm speaking as a fan now,
when,

1202
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,980
when,
when I look at acts rose,

1203
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,090
ifc,
a free person that means more to me than

1204
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:10,970
whether he did the right thing in 2000 
X.

1205
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,390
I'm more interested in that.
That's a unique perspective.

1206
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,690
So you liked the fact that he didn't 
give a fuck and he just went crazy.

1207
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:21,650
I love that about axl rose.
I love that about axl rose.

1208
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:24,030
I love that.
He doesn't give two fucks about eight.

1209
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,050
I think that's so fascinating because 
there are true.

1210
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,200
There are only a few American iconic 
artists that are truly free.

1211
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,890
Yeah.
And the fact that,

1212
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:37,960
so it was hunter Thompson Thompson free 
or you know,

1213
00:52:37,961 --> 00:52:40,130
it's like we only have a few of those 
people.

1214
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,330
Yeah.
Johnny cash.

1215
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,340
Johnny cash had some weird bad years and
yeah,

1216
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,760
you know,
was every year of Johnny cash perfect.

1217
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:48,320
Was every year of Neil Young.
Perfect.

1218
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,130
It's the sum total of what that person 
represents.

1219
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,710
That I think is the durability.
So we as fans,

1220
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,590
we get into like,
well,

1221
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,950
I don't like the new song or it.
I think that misses the mark.

1222
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,280
There's only one guns n roses in the 
whole world and I have fought mightily 

1223
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,430
internally to to protect what the 
smashing pumpkins means.

1224
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,340
I know it's not for everybody,
but there's only one smashing pumpkins.

1225
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:18,550
I know that.
I knew that as a kid and I got a little 

1226
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:19,430
lost in it and I've come out the other 
side and I realized that protecting what

1227
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:24,140
that brand is worth is is so much more 
valuable than whether somebody liked one

1228
00:53:24,141 --> 00:53:26,940
song or one album or something.
I said in 1992,

1229
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,740
it's so inconsequential.

1230
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:34,060
That's such a unique perspective.
When you look at Axel rose from the 

1231
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,160
point of view of being a fellow 
performer to what I.

1232
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,300
One of the things I really enjoy about 
axl rose's.

1233
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:42,310
I love comebacks.
I love when someone fucks their life up 

1234
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:42,770
and then just brings it right back 
around.

1235
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,150
I mean,
it's like a good fight,

1236
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:49,151
right?
Well that's like every success stories 

1237
00:53:49,151 --> 00:53:49,151
are awesome.
Love them,

1238
00:53:49,151 --> 00:53:53,510
but they're fairly commonplace,
but success complete fuck up.

1239
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,850
Success again.
Those are the stories.

1240
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,730
Those are the ones I enjoy and it's 
very.

1241
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,780
It's very American,
you know,

1242
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:04,781
we,
we love the comeback and there was some 

1243
00:54:04,781 --> 00:54:07,301
performances of axles when they were 
attempting to come back or maybe he was 

1244
00:54:07,301 --> 00:54:08,360
touring on his own.
I forget which one it was,

1245
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,450
what he was like off and it wasn't quite
there yet.

1246
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,290
And now you see him now live and he's 
fucking killing it.

1247
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,000
It's like he turned it around.

1248
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,680
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying is you could sit 

1249
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,200
there and talk about what somebody did 
in some year passed,

1250
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:26,900
but if they,
if they put it back together,

1251
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,050
they put it back together.
Not because they're trying to,

1252
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:29,570
to,
to,

1253
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:34,750
to satisfy something.
They're putting it together because the 

1254
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:34,750
forces within them are not easily 
controlled,

1255
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,260
but when there,
it's like a good fighter,

1256
00:54:36,261 --> 00:54:36,740
right.
When they,

1257
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,500
when they put it all together,
you know,

1258
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:42,040
I've heard you talk in commentary.
It's like a good fighter,

1259
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,050
like manages their adrenaline,
manages their,

1260
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:46,610
their focus,
you know what I mean?

1261
00:54:46,611 --> 00:54:49,490
You can't go completely hog and you 
can't be too conservative.

1262
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:51,020
You're right on that line.
Yeah.

1263
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,700
And that's what performance really is 
like.

1264
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:57,701
It's like a lot of people outside the 
bubble have a hard time understanding 

1265
00:54:57,701 --> 00:54:57,701
this like,
you know,

1266
00:54:57,701 --> 00:54:59,510
every night I stepped on stage,
I want to do a good show.

1267
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,110
Sometimes it's just not there to be had.
It could be the moon or it could be what

1268
00:55:03,111 --> 00:55:08,111
I eat for breakfast.
I don't know if I could be consistent 

1269
00:55:08,111 --> 00:55:11,141
about it.
I don't think that makes me as 

1270
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,221
fascinating as somebody who's like 
rolling the dice every time I'm up 

1271
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:12,221
there.
Yeah,

1272
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:12,221
I think that's much more interesting.

1273
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,370
Well,
that's one of the things that makes live

1274
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:15,750
shows so unique,
right?

1275
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:18,420
Is that you know that this guy is doing 
it right now.

1276
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,240
It's all happening.
The words are coming out of his mouth.

1277
00:55:21,241 --> 00:55:25,080
He's managing this moment apparently.
Yeah.

1278
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:30,890
I mean,
when you're a successful performer like 

1279
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,960
yourself and you see one hit wonders,
one hit wonders of always freaked me the

1280
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:38,961
fuck out,
and I don't know why I'm not even a 

1281
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,331
musician,
but just the horror of being successful 

1282
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:44,430
and hitting and then it all going away 
and then you're fucked.

1283
00:55:44,431 --> 00:55:45,570
Yeah.
I was terrified at that.

1284
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,750
God has got to be so scary.
That's,

1285
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:53,930
to me one of the more,
one of the weirder opportunities or 

1286
00:55:54,671 --> 00:55:59,671
moments in pop culture is when that kind
of stuff happens because with one song,

1287
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,800
you know,
she's my cherry pie.

1288
00:56:02,801 --> 00:56:05,160
You can just shoot to the top of the 
charts.

1289
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,970
Didn't they have two hits though?
I think they had a couple.

1290
00:56:06,971 --> 00:56:08,860
Right.
So there to hit wonders.

1291
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,610
Yeah.
But yeah,

1292
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,040
there's a gang of bands that had.

1293
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:12,990
Yeah,
I don't want to say the band,

1294
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:17,991
but like somebody I know went to see one
of those one hit wonder type pants and 

1295
00:56:17,991 --> 00:56:21,831
they,
they did their big famous song and the 

1296
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:21,831
crowd went crazy and then,
you know,

1297
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:24,080
they didn't see it at the show and then 
back on for that recording

1298
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,750
they did the song again the same side.
Yeah.

1299
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,660
And that's like for me it's a 
performance.

1300
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:33,700
It's heartbreaking.
It's like it'd be like me playing today 

1301
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,240
twice or something and here it is again.
Yeah.

1302
00:56:36,241 --> 00:56:41,241
That's two versions of stairway would be
like the dice man coming out and doing 

1303
00:56:41,551 --> 00:56:43,840
the rhymes again.
Yeah,

1304
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,320
yeah.
The thing about becoming a character,

1305
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,150
what you were talking about,
that is,

1306
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,050
that is a fascinating trap that I could 
imagine we'd be difficult.

1307
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:55,360
The expectations of your fans,
you know,

1308
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:57,460
I just love the fact that you've managed
that.

1309
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,600
So,
uh,

1310
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,080
so comfortably with Coke Cardio,
a lot of people not having,

1311
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:05,070
but I'm uncomfortable with it.
That's all that matters.

1312
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,830
I would argue that that's true.
I'm like,

1313
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,210
you know,
the plant,

1314
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:12,040
I planted these acoustic shows and you 
know,

1315
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:13,990
at some point people start shouting out 
songs and I,

1316
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:15,190
and I just say to the audience,
look,

1317
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:19,410
the great thing about turning 50 so I 
don't give a fuck what you want to do,

1318
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,080
what I want to do.

1319
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,030
And at the end of the day,
right,

1320
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,640
that sells better.
So most of the audience,

1321
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,440
because most of the audience I would 
argue,

1322
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:31,530
appreciates me being independent even if
they don't always get what they want 

1323
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,950
than being a shill.
Yes.

1324
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:36,160
I don't think people get behind rebels 
because they want them to sell out.

1325
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,900
They get behind rebels because they want
him to stay real.

1326
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,250
Rebellious.
Yes.

1327
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,060
Well,
yeah.

1328
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:43,390
For every person who yells out,
I want you to do your old stuff.

1329
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:46,270
There's many more people that just want 
you to be you.

1330
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:47,920
Yeah,
I would hope.

1331
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:48,850
Yeah.
Yeah,

1332
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:49,990
I would think so.
Yeah.

1333
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:55,500
You're doing really intimate places like
youtube in that Hollywood cemetery is 

1334
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,981
pretty well playing the cemetery and my 
friend Duncan used to do comedy shows 

1335
00:57:58,981 --> 00:57:58,981
out of there.
Oh really?

1336
00:57:58,981 --> 00:58:00,090
They do comedy there.
They used to duck.

1337
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:05,110
It's crazy though.
I don't think anybody else did it 

1338
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:05,110
before.

1339
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,010
Now he just decided it's a bit strange,
you know,

1340
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:11,790
just weird that they have a concert.
Like we couldn't sound check until a 

1341
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:12,670
certain time because there were people 
in a bereaved.

1342
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,490
People coming in to make their funeral 
arrangements.

1343
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,440
Yeah.
So it's like a weird thing like yeah,

1344
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:20,200
we can't sound check till 5:30
because there's somebody in the anteroom

1345
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,140
making burial arrangements for their 
family.

1346
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,340
Yeah.
Legitimately.

1347
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:24,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

1348
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:27,520
Like it's a real cemetery that also has 
concerts.

1349
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:30,760
Yeah.
How many does it seat to 50.

1350
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,470
Oh,
well it's really small.

1351
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,300
It's a cool vibe.
It's beautiful.

1352
00:58:34,301 --> 00:58:35,290
I mean it's really cool.
It's,

1353
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:37,540
I love the old Hollywood stuff,
so you know,

1354
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,760
works for me,
but it is a bit weird.

1355
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:41,380
Yeah.
I literally texted,

1356
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,790
you know,
like an ex girlfriend,

1357
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:45,460
like I'm literally playing a cemetery,
you know what I mean?

1358
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:46,750
It's like,
it just sounds so,

1359
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:47,350
like what?

1360
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,950
Yeah,
what,

1361
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,210
what,
what chose you or what,

1362
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,260
what made you choose that venue?
Uh,

1363
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:53,710
that's,
you know,

1364
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:55,450
you got your,
your agents sort of,

1365
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:56,590
you know,
when you're playing.

1366
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,600
I'm playing acoustic tour.
I played over two hours literally by 

1367
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:01,600
myself.
No help.

1368
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,390
So environment helps a lot with kind of 
creating the atmosphere to do that in 

1369
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,880
the more sterile the environment,
the less it feels kind of special.

1370
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:10,780
Right,
right.

1371
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:13,420
And so I do find the environment 
certainly helps.

1372
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,070
Yeah.
That's a,

1373
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,530
that's a small group of people to see 
you.

1374
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:21,980
Like what is that like to go from these 
big venues to doing these intimate

1375
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,130
setting.

1376
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,350
I used to really find that I could play 
a different show,

1377
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:31,530
small versus big.
And I've found over the last 10 years I 

1378
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,710
blamed the Internet that almost every 
audience is now the same.

1379
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:38,250
Wow.
That the expectations of the audience 

1380
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:38,250
from 2:50
to 5,000

1381
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:42,091
or up is almost identical.
That may be have also have something to 

1382
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:46,171
do with just having a long career and 
then people kind of say I want to see 

1383
00:59:46,171 --> 00:59:48,361
these songs or something,
but I don't find as much willingness to 

1384
00:59:48,361 --> 00:59:49,450
take the journey,
uh,

1385
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:51,010
used to be because we,
we,

1386
00:59:51,011 --> 00:59:56,011
you know,
in the nineties who would do shows in a 

1387
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:56,011
club and we would play no hits and just 
play weird besides.

1388
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:57,880
And people loved it because it was like,
I'm seeing the band,

1389
00:59:57,881 --> 00:59:59,530
I wouldn't get to see it the normal 
down.

1390
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:05,040
And then at some point that stopped and 
we would play a small club and play a 

1391
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:05,890
bunch of weird stuff and people would be
furious.

1392
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:11,260
Yeah.
You would look at twitter after it was 

1393
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:11,260
like,
fuck you,

1394
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:11,260
you ruined my night.
Oh,

1395
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,540
it was really furious.
Wow.

1396
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:18,490
But how many of those people were.
I mean like if you're in front of 400 

1397
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,850
people,
how many of those people were furious?

1398
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:20,570
Is it three?

1399
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,580
It would be a lot.
No,

1400
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,580
it'd be awhile.
No,

1401
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,630
it was a lot strange.
Weird,

1402
01:00:25,631 --> 01:00:27,100
yeah,
I just,

1403
01:00:27,101 --> 01:00:28,660
I don't know,
I think it's a cultural thing.

1404
01:00:28,661 --> 01:00:31,500
Maybe it's a generational thing.
Perhaps.

1405
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,610
Don't know.
Don't know.

1406
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:36,310
It surprised me because I grew up in 
this kind of anarchy time,

1407
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,440
you know,
Mosh pits and you know,

1408
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,490
we used to play a 45 minutes on religion
playing a 45 minute song today.

1409
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,210
I mean a 45 minute song.

1410
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,610
That's crazy,
you know.

1411
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:51,420
So what do you,
do you enjoy being on top of people like

1412
01:00:51,421 --> 01:00:53,820
that?
Like a 250 seat.

1413
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,800
It doesn't bother me.
It doesn't bother me at all.

1414
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,270
Does it feel different?

1415
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,990
What did you just get into your music in
order to play acoustic?

1416
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,860
I go super within.
I,

1417
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,520
I,
I,

1418
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:09,860
I,
I found that even because I originally 

1419
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:09,860
was going to stand in this I know seems 
kind of minor detail,

1420
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,160
but I decided to sit and,
and I actually found by sitting and 

1421
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,061
being very still and just performing and
doing my best job of performing the 

1422
01:01:18,061 --> 01:01:19,150
songs,
the audience enjoyed the show better.

1423
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,810
Like I took out all the show Showbiz,
you know when you're standing,

1424
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:23,520
you're doing the.
Yeah,

1425
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:24,030
yeah.
You know,

1426
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:29,130
whatever your moves,
I think creating a level of intimacy and

1427
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:34,471
drawing the audience forward is probably
the only sort of difference maker that 

1428
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:35,570
I've found because there's literally no,
there's no showbiz.

1429
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,520
I'm,
what can I do

1430
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,180
you seem very concerned with like you,
you want the audience to enjoy it.

1431
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:43,080
Yeah.
I didn't use to care.

1432
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:48,170
I,
I used to view performing as an art 

1433
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,841
project thing,
which is I want to sort of create a 

1434
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:53,871
provocative situation and then I want to
ride the wave of the provocative 

1435
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:54,360
situation.
And um,

1436
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:57,600
and of course I grew up in a 
generational thing that the audience was

1437
01:01:57,601 --> 01:02:02,160
sort of interested in that sort of the 
explosive nature of the mosh pit and you

1438
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:07,161
know,
this kind of weird sublimated violence 

1439
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:09,051
that would kind of come out during the 
shows and we were part of the engine 

1440
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:09,060
that would sort of bring up this 
emotional quality.

1441
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,400
And then at some point,
you know,

1442
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,710
things change.
Again,

1443
01:02:13,711 --> 01:02:15,600
I don't know if it's a generational 
thing,

1444
01:02:15,601 --> 01:02:20,601
but I found that um,
the only I could play older music with a

1445
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:26,430
good heart and an open mind was to get 
into the others,

1446
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:31,431
appreciating it because if he asked me,
it's not for me anymore because in 

1447
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:36,090
essence is an artist and,
and I'm not trying to jump in your head,

1448
01:02:36,091 --> 01:02:37,260
but as,
as an artist,

1449
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:41,490
I want to be able to say how do I feel 
tonight and tonight I want to,

1450
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,780
I've written like 400 songs.

1451
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:43,980
So to me I would like to say,
okay,

1452
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:46,710
of these 400 songs I just feel like 
playing these 15 songs tonight,

1453
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:51,980
but I can't do that because I do have to
go out and do the Hickory dickory dock 

1454
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:51,980
poem.
It's like,

1455
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:52,860
it's,
it's sort of,

1456
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,100
it's sort of expected.
And if I don't I'm going to get lit up.

1457
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:01,640
Right?
So I had to kind of create this weird 

1458
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,600
truce in my mind where it's like,
what way can I do this material in a way

1459
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:08,070
that feels heartfelt and genuine?
And I found by letting myself appreciate

1460
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:13,071
the audience's appreciation of that 
created like a joy that I didn't have 

1461
01:03:13,071 --> 01:03:14,760
before.
It didn't feel like a defeat and uh,

1462
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:18,150
and a tapping out to the,
to the moment it felt like,

1463
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,230
oh,
okay,

1464
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:22,800
we can create this exchange.
Was this a gradual process?

1465
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:27,801
Took me,
it took me awhile because I came from 

1466
01:03:27,801 --> 01:03:29,871
such complete anarchy that does sort of 
put myself in the straight jacket of 

1467
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:30,310
being a,
you know,

1468
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,440
growing up in the air.

1469
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,440
I grew up and it felt like putting on 
the gold lamay jacket and going to 

1470
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:36,440
vegas.
That's what it felt like to me.

1471
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,050
You know,
it felt like I was really,

1472
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,060
you know,
I,

1473
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:39,120
I'd become,
you know,

1474
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,860
one of those guys,
you know,

1475
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,940
doing the musty old routine.
It was like this is so antithetical to 

1476
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,000
why be even became an artist.
But at some point,

1477
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:49,710
again,
I had to appreciate that.

1478
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:55,100
Um,
and I talked about it once with Pete 

1479
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:55,100
Townsend in private.
It's like the idea that,

1480
01:03:55,410 --> 01:04:00,410
you know,
what is your responsibility to a 

1481
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:02,841
generational memory?
Like Pete was talking to me once about 

1482
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:05,460
how people were getting mad at him for 
using a and I saw him quoted publicly so

1483
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:07,380
I don't feel like I can.
I'm giving anything away.

1484
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,920
People are getting mad at him for using 
like won't get fooled again in a car 

1485
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,340
commercial and Pete's quote was 
something along the lines of like,

1486
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,850
I don't care if you lost your virginity 
to Mary Lou in the back seat to my song.

1487
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,890
It's my song.
I can do with it what I want.

1488
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,880
So it takes time to sort of appreciate 
that at some point if you've been lucky 

1489
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,381
enough and it.
And I am lucky enough to have created a 

1490
01:04:30,381 --> 01:04:33,020
few kind of cultural milestones for a 
generation or multiple generations that 

1491
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,860
they feel very possessive of those 
things.

1492
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:38,130
And so if you're not willing to possess 
them with them,

1493
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:42,210
it almost feels like to them you're 
rejecting their idea not your own.

1494
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,610
Oh Wow.
See to my mind,

1495
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:45,060
I'm like,
well,

1496
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:47,100
I'm the author.
If I don't feel like playing that song.

1497
01:04:47,101 --> 01:04:49,560
I mean that's my,
that's my decision.

1498
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:54,830
So you sold them on something and then 
if you're not buying anymore then it 

1499
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,730
almost feels like you're rejecting their
approval.

1500
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:58,390
Yes.
Yeah.

1501
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:03,560
And when you're surrounded by a bunch of
sycophantic artists who are literally 

1502
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,720
tripping all over themselves to give the
audience what they want to create.

1503
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:11,720
This kind of idealized isn't this 
amazing feeling and we've all been to 

1504
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,830
those shows.
It's the greatest concert ever.

1505
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:16,560
And then you go to the next show and 
it's the exact same lines in between the

1506
01:05:16,561 --> 01:05:18,610
songs.
It's Vegas,

1507
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:19,330
right?
Yeah.

1508
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:22,550
I mean capable of that.
So my way of feeling like you.

1509
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:28,710
But my appreciation of that was to try 
to get inside the head of why the 

1510
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:32,260
audience needed that from me because it 
felt burdensome.

1511
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:36,880
Like why me like get it from the guy 
over there.

1512
01:05:36,881 --> 01:05:40,120
Like there's plenty of people you can 
get this vibe from.

1513
01:05:40,121 --> 01:05:42,280
Why me?
Well that's the nickelback thing,

1514
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:45,430
right?
Like people demand sincerity and if they

1515
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:48,190
think that you're in like nickelback not
that bad,

1516
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,150
but there are the fucking punchline of 
punchlines when it comes to bad,

1517
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:54,460
bad music.
And to me,

1518
01:05:54,461 --> 01:05:58,030
the guy's an incredible writer.
I mean Chad,

1519
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,470
I mean he's an incredible songwriter.

1520
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,770
I like their songs.
I liked some of their music.

1521
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,850
I do,
I know it.

1522
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:07,990
Some of it is like cliche subject matter
and I don't care of.

1523
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:10,960
There's a lot of great songs that have 
cliche sub subject matter,

1524
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:13,530
but I don't,
I don't think there's anything I.

1525
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,240
and I'm not trying to.
I don't know enough about their world,

1526
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:19,810
but I don't think there's anything wrong
if that's who you want to be.

1527
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,840
Yes.
Pop to me is predicated on unsatisfying 

1528
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:24,840
pop.
I've said it many times.

1529
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,610
Pop is pouring,
it's pouring and want to get you off.

1530
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,420
Right?
Right.

1531
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,870
And it's,
it's just,

1532
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:31,600
you know how they're going to get you 
off.

1533
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,700
That's a good way of looking at it.
Okay.

1534
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:35,440
I'm not that concerned with getting you 
off.

1535
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:38,530
I'm just not.
I'm just not.

1536
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,800
It's just not in my DNA.
I was never that guy.

1537
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,330
I was never that guy.

1538
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:44,830
So to.
So at some point,

1539
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:46,030
you know,
pick your age,

1540
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:48,460
41,
you got some guy tapping on the shoulder

1541
01:06:48,461 --> 01:06:48,880
saying,
hey,

1542
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:50,980
I need you to be that guy.
You're like me.

1543
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,790
Have you looked at me lately?
I mean I'm not that guy.

1544
01:06:55,340 --> 01:07:00,340
He's a very strange so I had to get 
inside the head of why people needed 

1545
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,561
that,
like what that did for them and sort of 

1546
01:07:04,561 --> 01:07:05,200
a very general level.
It's sort of,

1547
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:06,310
it's a,
it's a,

1548
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,670
it's a community thing or something.
Yes.

1549
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:11,860
And so there's a way to do it where it 
feels good,

1550
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,470
positive,
loving and,

1551
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:15,190
and,
and proportional.

1552
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:18,880
Like it doesn't have to be slobbish and 
it can be cool like okay,

1553
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:22,150
this is the right moment for it or I can
set this up and now I can do it.

1554
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:25,660
Like using the dice man as an example.
I've seen him a couple times.

1555
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,920
I laughed my ass off when I saw him and 
when I saw him he did his whole routine.

1556
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:33,440
He showed up at the comedy store one 
night I just happened,

1557
01:07:33,441 --> 01:07:38,441
would they be there with a friend?
And he did it like an unannounced 

1558
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:40,890
appearance.
He was fantastic and at the end he kind 

1559
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:40,890
Kinda,
he kinda of made the face and like.

1560
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:45,511
And then he went into it,
but it felt like it was the only way he 

1561
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:45,570
could stop the moment.
Right.

1562
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,350
So it right.
In that moment it felt like,

1563
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,430
okay,
this is cool.

1564
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,710
Because it's like,
it feels like,

1565
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:52,120
hey,
you've been good.

1566
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:54,400
We ate the whole cake together.
Here's the cherry.

1567
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:59,520
Yeah.
But when it feels like I got to do this 

1568
01:07:59,520 --> 01:07:59,860
because that's the gay.
I don't know.

1569
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,900
I went through that whole process 
himself.

1570
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,930
Like he abandoned the rhymes for a long 
time,

1571
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:07,000
didn't even kind of try to abandon the 
character a bit.

1572
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:10,420
I have a little bit of a memory of that.
He did a television show,

1573
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:15,510
like a regular sitcoms,
and he cried on some TV show like 

1574
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:16,640
Arsenio Hall

1575
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,640
or something like that,
about people angry at him for being 

1576
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,851
controversial.
And I don't remember the early days of 

1577
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:25,610
political correctness when TV first came
around.

1578
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,070
Yeah,
yeah.

1579
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:32,080
It was A.
I think it was a little bit of a trap 

1580
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,020
that he felt like he was in.
And now I think in a similar fashion,

1581
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,840
maybe similar

1582
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:37,270
and using him as a sort of a.
As an example,

1583
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:40,570
how many comedians have actually risen 
up to that site?

1584
01:08:40,571 --> 01:08:43,210
Guys?
Level on almost none.

1585
01:08:43,211 --> 01:08:48,040
I mean it's been like a handful.
He was hot as you could be ever.

1586
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:53,220
So paralleling my own self in that way.
It does create this weird

1587
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:01,540
cause cause the 20 percent who know 
every song and and whatever and know 

1588
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,990
every nuance.
The other 80 percent they just know the,

1589
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,040
the greatest hits thing.
It's not their fault.

1590
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:08,720
It feels weird.
Like,

1591
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,570
is that all I am?
Right?

1592
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:11,750
I've done all this,
you know,

1593
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:15,440
didn't you see me when I wave this flag 
and now they don't.

1594
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:19,730
All they know is you're the rat in the 
cage guy and you can be hostile about it

1595
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:21,440
all you want.
It's not going to change.

1596
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:27,190
Yeah,
I mean the amount of times I've been in 

1597
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:29,060
a parking garage or a grocery store or 
whatever,

1598
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:34,061
and somebody who's very nice,
very respectful will walk up to me and 

1599
01:09:34,061 --> 01:09:34,870
that's what they know and if you can be 
humble,

1600
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:39,871
but I think it's pretty amazing that 
literally I can get off any exit in 

1601
01:09:39,871 --> 01:09:43,070
America and pretty much anywhere I go 
somebody has some reference to what I've

1602
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:43,310
done.

1603
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,590
That's pretty,
pretty remarkable.

1604
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,240
So if you can get behind that,
you can think,

1605
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:48,020
oh,
that's pretty cool.

1606
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:48,850
I'm cool with that.
It's,

1607
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:52,100
it's not this oppositional thing,
like you should have paid more attention

1608
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:55,160
in 94.
The Revolution was happening.

1609
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:58,070
Where were you?
You were listening to somebody else,

1610
01:09:58,071 --> 01:09:59,590
you know,
like there's requirements.

1611
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,610
Yeah,
yeah,

1612
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,640
yeah.
And I installed so part and parcel to 

1613
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:05,640
when you take a,
a fringe movement,

1614
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,140
which,
you know,

1615
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:07,400
alternative music,
grunge,

1616
01:10:07,401 --> 01:10:09,500
whatever it was,
and it's thrown into the mainstream,

1617
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:14,120
those social codes and mores don't 
translate very well to mainstream code.

1618
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:19,440
Yeah.
If you look at what people have done in 

1619
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:19,440
the last 10 years,
they just steal that stuff.

1620
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,310
They take this coat and they take this 
walk and they take this stance and they 

1621
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,560
take this production style and they say,
I'll take that.

1622
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,360
Yeah.
They just combined it all together.

1623
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,920
Yeah,
because it's because that's their gig.

1624
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,670
I've always wondered what it's like when
you are.

1625
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,670
When you're beginning as an artist,
you know you're,

1626
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:43,600
you're idealistic.
You have all these ideas about what the 

1627
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:43,700
future could be.
Who knows?

1628
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:46,130
It's all wide open and then all of a 
sudden,

1629
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:51,850
many years later,
you are a fucking massive superstar 

1630
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:55,001
selling out arenas.
How difficult is it to find people who 

1631
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:58,130
understand where your head is 
impossible.

1632
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,000
Do you like seek out other superstar 
musicians?

1633
01:11:02,001 --> 01:11:02,160
And.

1634
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,040
I did and I got nowhere.
It.

1635
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:09,041
They're either really.
I've had a hard time ever getting like 

1636
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:10,220
good data,
let's put it that way.

1637
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:16,140
The freakiest was.
I saw how it changed my inner world,

1638
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,750
meaning friends and family,
how so?

1639
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:23,910
My step grandfather,
who was a world war two vet,

1640
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,670
very closed down,
classic Eisenhower,

1641
01:11:26,671 --> 01:11:28,890
Republican type of guy,
smart.

1642
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:34,400
You know what I mean?
Had literally zero interest in me as a 

1643
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:34,530
kid.
I mean,

1644
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:40,220
negative zero interest and,
and one day I'm sitting there at 

1645
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,930
Christmas and now grandpa wants to talk 
to me about the economics of my success.

1646
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:45,150
Whoa.
And it's like,

1647
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:50,850
like that got through to him because 
some guy at work or somebody at the 

1648
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:52,260
church brought me up and it was like,
oh,

1649
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:54,240
that's my grandson,
you know,

1650
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,960
nothing about childhood,
childhood tiers did anything but that I 

1651
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,160
saw were warped the gravity in my 
family.

1652
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,350
And then you get the friend,
like,

1653
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,340
you know,
you're different.

1654
01:12:05,341 --> 01:12:05,910
It's like,
yeah,

1655
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:07,440
I'm different.
Of course I'm different,

1656
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:10,320
you know what I mean?
You know what I mean?

1657
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:12,690
It's like you got a million dollars in 
my pocket,

1658
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,250
you know what I mean?
I could buy,

1659
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:15,250
you know.
Yeah.

1660
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,500
I mean,
you know,

1661
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:21,501
I one day walked into beverly hills and 
paid cash for Ferrari and that's just 

1662
01:12:21,501 --> 01:12:21,501
dumb stuff.
Like,

1663
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:22,920
that's kind of awesome though.
Yeah.

1664
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:28,770
Yeah.
I remember the people don't like the 

1665
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:28,770
idea of that.
I think it's funny,

1666
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:28,940
right?
It's amazing.

1667
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,700
You bought a Ferrari with money that you
had on you.

1668
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,290
That's fucking crazy.

1669
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:35,240
And it was.
And it was the classic story.

1670
01:12:35,241 --> 01:12:35,920
I walk in,
you know,

1671
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:38,810
the guy didn't know who I was like,
so how are you going to pay for this?

1672
01:12:38,811 --> 01:12:39,890
And I was like,
cash

1673
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,430
you have a brick with you was like,
Oh wow,

1674
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,850
that's just an awesome thing to be able 
to do.

1675
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,550
So I'm saying you go from like literally
complete,

1676
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:54,310
not abject poverty poor.
I had no movie.

1677
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:55,020
Right.
You know.

1678
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,700
And then one day I'm like throwing,
you know,

1679
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:02,410
Geez,
around for dumb cars and let's also you,

1680
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:07,500
you've reached such a high level that 
there's nothing above that.

1681
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:08,660
Like

1682
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,080
I have the,
I have the antidote,

1683
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:13,500
my manager who was,
you know,

1684
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:15,390
we were with the Metallica guys at the 
time,

1685
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,450
he called me on like a Wednesday or 
something and he said,

1686
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:23,451
I can't say for sure,
but more than likely based on the calls 

1687
01:13:23,451 --> 01:13:24,900
we're getting,
you're going to be number one this week.

1688
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:27,070
Meaning melancholy.
And I,

1689
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:29,490
I literally said,
is there a position higher?

1690
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:36,380
Like I couldn't process that.
There wasn't like another step.

1691
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:37,570
Couldn't keep going.
Yeah.

1692
01:13:37,571 --> 01:13:39,420
Yeah.
Well that's what I always wondered.

1693
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:44,421
Like when you reach a certain level and 
you're sending out these giant arenas 

1694
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:47,540
and you one of the biggest bands 
literally ever look at one of the top,

1695
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:50,120
100 biggest bands of all time.
Right?

1696
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:51,620
Arguably.
Yeah.

1697
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:52,600
If we're in there.
Yeah,

1698
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:53,660
it's in there.
Yeah.

1699
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:57,450
Where the fuck do you go?
Like it had to be this weird.

1700
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:02,910
Yeah.
I would imagine the madness is the only 

1701
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:05,111
option.
Madness started becomes attractive at 

1702
01:14:05,111 --> 01:14:05,111
that point.
God,

1703
01:14:05,111 --> 01:14:06,350
that's got to be so strange to be just 
crushing it.

1704
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:08,630
Selling out these giant arena is number 
one.

1705
01:14:08,631 --> 01:14:11,590
Songs going now what?
What the fuck do we do?

1706
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,310
Do we fade

1707
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,650
away now?
We went crazy.

1708
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,950
We just lost her mind.
It's like,

1709
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,720
what happened?
What was the process?

1710
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:20,980
Did you see it slipping away?
Or you see the madness and it became,

1711
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:21,600
you know,
it's like,

1712
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,220
it's like a bad relationship or bad 
relationships.

1713
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:29,280
You,
it becomes a lot clearer when you're 

1714
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:29,280
out.
You know,

1715
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,370
at the time you sort of do your own 
rationalization.

1716
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:31,420
Like,
oh,

1717
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,880
he or she's going crazy,
not me.

1718
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,090
We all went crazy in four different 
directions.

1719
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,890
Wow.
And this and that.

1720
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:40,850
And the great shame of,
of,

1721
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:46,030
of my band was musically we were super 
tight and we never disagreed on music.

1722
01:14:47,051 --> 01:14:51,790
It was like this weird phenomenon where 
musically we were like totally in sync.

1723
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:55,600
We could produce and write music very,
very quickly and it was always the other

1724
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:58,870
stuff around us.
So that sort of ate at the core.

1725
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:01,030
And then when we,
when we lost our personal relationship,

1726
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,800
that's what diminished the musical 
relationship.

1727
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:08,140
But you don't know it at the time 
because you sort of,

1728
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,580
I don't want to say arrogance,
not the right word,

1729
01:15:09,581 --> 01:15:12,000
but it's like you have a sort of a,
you know,

1730
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:17,001
you got a little bit of a thing in your 
walk and you think you got the world by 

1731
01:15:17,001 --> 01:15:17,440
the unit.
What and all good.

1732
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:20,920
You think you can power your way through
anything because you have,

1733
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:26,370
right?
You don't understand that you do 

1734
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:26,370
actually need the people standing next 
to you.

1735
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:28,240
I have such a greater appreciation for 
my bandmates now that now that I've seen

1736
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:32,870
what we actually did accomplish in ink 
is surrounded by chaos.

1737
01:15:32,871 --> 01:15:35,530
But then we created our own cast and 
then at some point it all blurs.

1738
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:40,180
What were the things that fucked it up?
Was it the money and the fame?

1739
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:43,150
And was it the tension?
Was it the ego?

1740
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,560
Um,
I think,

1741
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:45,250
uh,
we were,

1742
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,650
we were like one of those bad.
I'm behind the musics,

1743
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:52,651
the very early conversation.
I remember we had these managers very 

1744
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,900
early on in and they were coming to 
town,

1745
01:15:55,901 --> 01:16:00,901
sort of courting us before we had a 
record deal and one day they came to 

1746
01:16:00,901 --> 01:16:03,781
town and they said,
can we just go out to breakfast with 

1747
01:16:03,781 --> 01:16:06,271
you?
Which was weird because it was always 

1748
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,120
the whole band like democracy.
And they said,

1749
01:16:07,121 --> 01:16:08,200
um,
they said,

1750
01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:10,240
uh,
know who writes the songs?

1751
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,110
And I said,
well,

1752
01:16:11,111 --> 01:16:12,430
I do.
And they said,

1753
01:16:12,431 --> 01:16:13,390
well,
that's gonna be a problem.

1754
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:18,750
Like,
what do you mean it's gonna be a 

1755
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:18,750
problem?
And he said,

1756
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,401
well,
songwriters and bands make a lot more 

1757
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:22,741
money.
So our suggestion is you should share 

1758
01:16:22,741 --> 01:16:25,450
your songs with your band mates to keep 
sort of a kind of a democratic state and

1759
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:26,900
the use of examples of bands that did 
it.

1760
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,280
And I thought,
hell no,

1761
01:16:28,281 --> 01:16:31,270
I'm not on,
I'm not giving them my work.

1762
01:16:31,271 --> 01:16:33,130
I mean it's my song.
So they were like,

1763
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:34,780
you don't understand,
you're gonna make a lot more money.

1764
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:36,370
And I was like,
tough shit.

1765
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,040
You know what I mean?
It's like live and learn kind of thing.

1766
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,660
Why do they think you were going to make
more money?

1767
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:44,880
Because it was songwriters get a quick 
lesson.

1768
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:50,220
Uh,
the songwriter gets paid separate 

1769
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:53,401
statutorily by the government than the,
than the actual copyright of the 

1770
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:55,720
recording.
So if I'm on Joe Rogan's label,

1771
01:16:56,290 --> 01:17:01,290
you pay the band for the recording,
which of course in that case would be 

1772
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:04,711
split four ways,
but you owe me a statutory rate as a 

1773
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:08,251
songwriter for the sale,
which I think these days is about 10 

1774
01:17:08,251 --> 01:17:09,070
sentence.
So every record we,

1775
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:14,530
where I was the sole songwriter,
I was getting ten cents that they 

1776
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:15,590
weren't getting a or eight cents or 
whatever it was at the time.

1777
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,020
So you can imagine over a gazillion 
records sold.

1778
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,940
It added up.
Yeah.

1779
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:23,960
So I start pulling away financially,
you know what I mean?

1780
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,130
But when you're a kid and you're 23 and 
somebodies having this conversation with

1781
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:30,110
you and you literally don't even have an
apartment,

1782
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:35,750
right.
And somebody is trying to tell you how 

1783
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:35,750
you're going to make a lot more money.
It's like,

1784
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,531
what does that mean?
Fast forward four years later and it's 

1785
01:17:38,531 --> 01:17:41,261
like I'm making a lot more money.
So that's sort of SOS it organically.

1786
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:44,090
So his discontent,
yes.

1787
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:49,720
Whether you call it jealousy or not.
And then as I emerged as sort of the 

1788
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,010
tour and the big mouth in the band and 
maybe the person who was most willing to

1789
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:57,011
be controversy or whatever,
we'd get in a room with journalists and 

1790
01:17:57,011 --> 01:18:00,191
they would just talk to me a and then we
get out of the interviews and that the 

1791
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,200
band members would yell at me for them 
not being asked questions.

1792
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:09,820
So there's like this weird thing,
like it was my responsibility to push 

1793
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,240
them more as stars or.
Yeah.

1794
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:16,241
So it's not just about the music,
it's about being appreciated and 

1795
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:16,241
successful.
And now in hindsight,

1796
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:19,760
and in fairness to them,
I didn't appreciate why it was important

1797
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:22,880
to them because in their minds we're all
equal.

1798
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:24,560
We're in the room together.
Yeah,

1799
01:18:24,561 --> 01:18:25,790
you write the songs,
that's cool,

1800
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:30,791
but at least give me the social currency
of being recognized or you know,

1801
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:35,420
or somebody would offer me alone a 
magazine cover.

1802
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,760
And if I was smart,
which I wasn't,

1803
01:18:37,761 --> 01:18:39,980
I should've said no only the band or 
nothing.

1804
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,170
But I was like,
sure,

1805
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,850
put me on the cover.
I'll take it.

1806
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:44,930
You know what I mean?
Right.

1807
01:18:44,931 --> 01:18:48,410
You probably would have saw thought they
would do the same thing if someone came.

1808
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:49,380
Absolutely.
Yeah,

1809
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:54,610
absolutely.
And then of course it becomes tit for 

1810
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:56,351
tat than like a two of the band members 
went on their own and made a record 

1811
01:18:56,351 --> 01:18:56,351
deal.

1812
01:18:56,351 --> 01:18:57,500
Um,
without me,

1813
01:18:58,010 --> 01:19:00,410
they got somebody to give them a bunch 
of money to start a label,

1814
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,050
which they had every right to do.
You know what I mean?

1815
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:08,360
So suddenly they're like making side 
deals and it starts getting all that 

1816
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:08,810
weird business.
And right now again,

1817
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:12,110
it's like an erosion factor.
You don't appreciate it from within.

1818
01:19:12,111 --> 01:19:13,760
There's a lot of compression,
there's a lot of money,

1819
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:18,761
there's a lot of stuff going on and then
one day it's sort of hollows out and 

1820
01:19:18,761 --> 01:19:18,761
then it's too late,
you know,

1821
01:19:18,761 --> 01:19:20,360
you can't just sort of sit down and have
a meeting and make it all okay.

1822
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,000
Because the wounds are deep and in our 
case,

1823
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:28,001
I mean the wounds lasted for.
I didn't talk to darcy for 17 years and 

1824
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:32,750
I didn't talk to James for I think 16.
Wow.

1825
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,880
So we'd met named in the heat was,
was real.

1826
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,880
I mean we didn't.
There were lawsuits and all sorts of 

1827
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,221
stuff and it's such a common story that 
I hope someone listens to this part of 

1828
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:43,490
your mission as well.
They won't.

1829
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,250
It's just human nature.
Right.

1830
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:48,740
Because I would,
it is power corrupts man.

1831
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,900
Yeah.
And again,

1832
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:54,890
no sympathy asking him today though.
I mean when's that?

1833
01:19:55,010 --> 01:20:00,010
It wouldn't today.
Like I feel like if you were in the 

1834
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:00,560
similar position today,
you'd have hindsight and your favorite.

1835
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,440
Oh yeah.
No,

1836
01:20:01,441 --> 01:20:01,880
no,
I would,

1837
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:02,960
yeah.
I mean,

1838
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:07,961
and even talking about the band going 
back on a tour and the possibility that 

1839
01:20:07,961 --> 01:20:08,130
it's like I approach completely 
different.

1840
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,990
Yeah,
so that's what I'm saying.

1841
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:14,991
Like power doesn't necessarily corrupt.
It corrupts if you don't know what the 

1842
01:20:14,991 --> 01:20:14,991
fuck it's going to do to you.
Sure.

1843
01:20:14,991 --> 01:20:15,320
Yeah.

1844
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:20,260
But again,
I'm not preaching for sympathy,

1845
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:25,290
but the,
and I can't speak for the modern music 

1846
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:27,991
business,
but the business we're in in the 

1847
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:30,061
nineties,
we were surrounded by people who were 

1848
01:20:30,061 --> 01:20:32,941
giving us wrong information.
Now were they giving us wrong 

1849
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:33,730
information on purpose or because they 
weren't bright enough?

1850
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:38,850
I don't know,
but we weren't getting the right 

1851
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:40,261
information.
Very few people actually try to sit us 

1852
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:40,261
down and say,
look,

1853
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:41,470
this is going to be a problem.
Trust me,

1854
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:47,900
you know,
it's like you're in there with the 

1855
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:47,900
hounds

1856
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,820
just right.
And they probably don't have the time 

1857
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:52,601
for psychological management anyway.
They're probably in the middle of just 

1858
01:20:52,601 --> 01:20:52,610
trying to figure out how to make money 
off you.

1859
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,970
And Maya is my understanding.

1860
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,130
My understanding is they and I,
and again going back to the conversation

1861
01:20:57,131 --> 01:20:58,810
I had with the executive,
they just basically look in,

1862
01:20:58,811 --> 01:21:00,370
they say you've got four years if you're
lucky,

1863
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:02,190
if you're lucky,
so why are they going to,

1864
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:08,100
why are they going to spend a bunch of 
time trying to hold your hand knowing 

1865
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:08,100
you're going to lose anyway?

1866
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,820
What a crazy relationship between the 
record labels and the artists.

1867
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,850
It's similar,
I guess probably like the pit boss,

1868
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:16,800
if you're,
if you're having a hot run,

1869
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:21,801
it like roulette.
The pit bosses just like enjoy it now 

1870
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,600
because we're going to get it back.
That's what it feels like.

1871
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:29,870
What percentage of musicians or musical 
artists that get signed by a label and 

1872
01:21:33,571 --> 01:21:38,571
put something out,
ever wind up having an actually 

1873
01:21:38,571 --> 01:21:40,280
successful career?
Probably less than 10 percent.

1874
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,140
Jesus Christ.
I would say it's probably even smaller.

1875
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:46,050
A meat grinder of a business.
You would think like,

1876
01:21:46,051 --> 01:21:48,030
hey man,
we're on fucking warner brothers.

1877
01:21:48,031 --> 01:21:49,080
Dude.
We made it.

1878
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:51,120
It's happening.
They're going to promote us.

1879
01:21:51,121 --> 01:21:51,810
They're gonna.
Push us.

1880
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:52,710
They signed us

1881
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,490
and,
and sorry to interrupt again,

1882
01:21:54,491 --> 01:21:59,491
but the other weird thing is the athlete
in the system I was in was even if you 

1883
01:22:00,221 --> 01:22:05,221
were successful,
it was set up to make you feel like you 

1884
01:22:05,221 --> 01:22:05,221
weren't successful.
Right?

1885
01:22:05,221 --> 01:22:07,210
Because that was the work.
That was the manipulation.

1886
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:13,590
Yeah.
I once said to somebody who is a very 

1887
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:17,251
famous name in the business,
it's like you guys find a needle in the 

1888
01:22:17,251 --> 01:22:21,421
haystack and then you spend the next 20 
years telling them they're not a needle 

1889
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:21,421
in the haystack.
Right?

1890
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,170
It's it.
What I'm trying to say,

1891
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:28,171
and I'm not saying it well,
is you would think you would be 

1892
01:22:28,171 --> 01:22:29,350
surrounded by people are telling you 
you're talented,

1893
01:22:29,351 --> 01:22:32,350
you're special.
We want to help you because the more you

1894
01:22:32,351 --> 01:22:37,351
succeed,
we'll succeed and we'll all succeed 

1895
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:37,351
together.
It was the exact opposite.

1896
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:37,351
It was like,
no,

1897
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:38,470
you're dumb.
You're wrong.

1898
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:40,090
No,
you're crazy.

1899
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:42,880
Don't do that.
You're going to ruin it.

1900
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:45,220
And then,
and even if you'd say,

1901
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,230
I want to wear this hat,
okay,

1902
01:22:47,231 --> 01:22:48,970
I'm going to wear this hat.
And when it wouldn't work,

1903
01:22:48,971 --> 01:22:50,000
that's say see to listen.

1904
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:53,080
Uh,
is that universal?

1905
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:55,230
Have you heard that other musicians?
I have the same.

1906
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:55,640
It

1907
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:58,510
was universal because looking back it 
doesn't feel personal to me.

1908
01:22:58,570 --> 01:22:59,450
It felt like I,
I,

1909
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,600
you know,
use your bad analogy.

1910
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:02,890
Pimp Ho.
I don't know.

1911
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:05,890
Right.
It's a weird con thing.

1912
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:09,380
That was my experience was a lot of con 
jobs.

1913
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:13,830
Courtney love a piece that she wrote 
about the music business.

1914
01:23:13,831 --> 01:23:15,690
I'm sure you're aware of that.
Was she,

1915
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:17,040
was it recent or.
No,

1916
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,500
no.
Bunch of years ago where she was.

1917
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:24,890
I think it was actually probably before 
digital got really huge and it was a lot

1918
01:23:26,611 --> 01:23:28,020
of people thought she had a ghost 
writer,

1919
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:33,080
but it was really eye opening to a lot 
of people that didn't know anything 

1920
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:36,270
about the music business,
where the money actually goes and how,

1921
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:41,190
how much money has to be spent and how 
little you actually make.

1922
01:23:41,191 --> 01:23:42,810
Even though if you sell a shit ton of 
records,

1923
01:23:42,811 --> 01:23:44,090
you've never seen this spring.

1924
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,780
2,000
actually is on salon.com.

1925
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,300
It might have been one of the years we 
weren't talking about.

1926
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:50,670
They go,
yeah,

1927
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,650
well it's

1928
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:56,120
for people that haven't read it.
It's pretty eyeopening.

1929
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,820
I've nothing to do with the music 
business.

1930
01:23:58,821 --> 01:24:01,940
I've always been absolutely fascinating 
as a completely objective observer.

1931
01:24:01,941 --> 01:24:06,941
Just looking at this whole thing seems 
so crazy because it's if you do not get 

1932
01:24:07,761 --> 01:24:10,910
signed and if you do not get promoted 
until recently,

1933
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,190
you had no chance.
They.

1934
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:16,280
They literally controlled the rains and 
the direction of your career.

1935
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:21,370
Almost like an actor.
Like you can't make it as an actor 

1936
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:22,100
unless you get an audition and someone 
chooses to put you in a film.

1937
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:27,170
But like the Great Greek mythology type 
myth thing that the music business has 

1938
01:24:27,781 --> 01:24:32,781
made to critical mistakes over the last 
30 or so years that led to its current 

1939
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:37,731
sort of reduce status.
One was they let mtv run a muck on free 

1940
01:24:37,731 --> 01:24:42,501
content and when they tried to rein mtv 
and MTV basically told him to take a 

1941
01:24:42,501 --> 01:24:47,001
hike in the music business back down.
So when MTV stopped playing music 

1942
01:24:47,001 --> 01:24:50,961
content,
there was nothing in the music business 

1943
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:50,961
could do because they'd given away all 
their leverage to the to MTV.

1944
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:55,760
And then the second was when napster 
showed up and they acted like napster 

1945
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,360
was a virus,
that they just need us to stamp out,

1946
01:24:57,780 --> 01:25:02,780
not really realizing that napster was 
just the beginning of a whole wave of 

1947
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:06,060
new technologies and new sort of social 
interactions or something.

1948
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:09,360
Those two critical errors lead to the 
music business.

1949
01:25:09,361 --> 01:25:11,010
Reduced position.

1950
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:14,870
And it's this music.
I mean music has been around forever,

1951
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:17,820
but the music business has been around 
100.

1952
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:22,960
Yeah.
I think we're into 120 plus years of 

1953
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:22,960
recordings.
Yeah.

1954
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,580
Amazing.
How,

1955
01:25:24,581 --> 01:25:29,581
what a iron fist they've managed to 
control the business with and,

1956
01:25:29,861 --> 01:25:32,760
and to sort of wrangle the artists for 
the most,

1957
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:32,790
most

1958
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:34,290
part.
Well,

1959
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,780
it's weird.
Wizard of Oz,

1960
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,330
you know,
don't,

1961
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,930
don't,
you know,

1962
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:41,420
don't look behind the curtain.
Have you ever thought about being on the

1963
01:25:41,421 --> 01:25:42,560
other side?
Yeah,

1964
01:25:42,561 --> 01:25:44,090
I have,
but I just don't have that much.

1965
01:25:44,091 --> 01:25:49,091
I'm actually,
that's why I'm more interested in 

1966
01:25:49,091 --> 01:25:49,091
wrestling.
I think I liked that.

1967
01:25:49,091 --> 01:25:51,701
I like the,
even though it's this sort of weird 

1968
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:53,621
business,
I sort of liked that because it doesn't 

1969
01:25:53,621 --> 01:25:55,481
have anything to do with music.
I have too much damage and too many I 

1970
01:25:55,481 --> 01:25:56,690
don't think I could see clearly.
Does it make sense?

1971
01:25:56,691 --> 01:25:59,030
It's like,
it's still too weird for me.

1972
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:00,410
Yeah,
no it does.

1973
01:26:00,411 --> 01:26:04,340
It does make sense when you first,
when I first to La in whatever

1974
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,800
90 and had the meetings and you'd be in 
that,

1975
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,570
that,
you know,

1976
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:12,580
hit the office and the people with the 
beards and everything and they'd be 

1977
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:13,940
like.
So when we put the product out and every

1978
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:17,270
time they would say product,
I would sort of wince product,

1979
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:20,540
like how can you call my art product,
you know what I mean?

1980
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:24,290
And that's to them it's just,
it's cookies and toilet paper.

1981
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:25,610
It's,
it's whatever.

1982
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,240
And um,
and it's not to say they're not fans and

1983
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:31,010
they don't appreciate or they don't 
care,

1984
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:33,620
but at the end of the day it's just some
sort of weird business,

1985
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:36,260
you know,
and like all institutional cultures that

1986
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:41,261
are sort of kind of corrupted their 
court just send it runs on its own 

1987
01:26:41,261 --> 01:26:41,261
inertia.
It's,

1988
01:26:41,261 --> 01:26:45,860
it just does.
When you see someone like chance the 

1989
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:48,641
rapper break out of that system,
do you think that that's a model that 

1990
01:26:48,641 --> 01:26:49,370
can be followed or is he just like an 
outlier?

1991
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:55,090
No,
it's certainly a model that can be 

1992
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:55,090
followed,
but you know,

1993
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:55,090
it probably works because he's so 
talented.

1994
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:56,780
It's like a weird combination.
I mean,

1995
01:26:57,050 --> 01:27:02,050
use the mcgregor example.
It's like how many Mcgregor's or are 

1996
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,260
there in the world and beyond being a 
skilled fighter.

1997
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:08,261
I mean the guys in a level talker.
Speaking from a professional wresting 

1998
01:27:08,261 --> 01:27:11,861
standpoint,
the guys probably the best promo in the 

1999
01:27:11,861 --> 01:27:11,861
world.
Yeah,

2000
01:27:11,861 --> 01:27:15,770
no,
he's the best as far as MMA guys and 

2001
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:19,001
it's also he has in this very unique 
position where he has insane support 

2002
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:24,311
from Ireland.
I mean insane that you've never seen 

2003
01:27:24,311 --> 01:27:27,011
anything like it.
I've been calling fights for a long 

2004
01:27:27,011 --> 01:27:28,220
time.
I've been working for the UFC since 97.

2005
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:33,550
I've never seen anybody like him.
I've never seen any support like the 

2006
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:35,300
support the Irish people have for him.
It's fucking crazy.

2007
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,150
And you see the videos of when he fought
mayweather.

2008
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,570
Not even where they fought.
They were in Mandalay,

2009
01:27:41,571 --> 01:27:45,890
bay,
Irish had flooded Mandalay bay,

2010
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:50,070
the walkway from Mandalay Bay as you 
walk towards the arena and towards where

2011
01:27:50,071 --> 01:27:55,071
they are exhibited ship,
there was nothing but Irish people 

2012
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:58,130
singing and it's fucking crazy,
man.

2013
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,200
It's like,
who organize this?

2014
01:28:00,201 --> 01:28:05,201
No one who told him to start saying 
things as organic as an Irish 

2015
01:28:05,201 --> 01:28:09,941
descendant.
We know we've been waiting for a long 

2016
01:28:09,941 --> 01:28:09,941
time for conor mcgregor.
Yeah,

2017
01:28:09,941 --> 01:28:11,670
man.
I mean poets and Bondo.

2018
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:16,680
You know what I mean?
We needed a fighter in there to someone 

2019
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:16,680
who's fun.
Yeah.

2020
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,730
But to see all those people cheer and 
scream.

2021
01:28:19,731 --> 01:28:24,731
And I was talking to Daniel cormier 
about it this past weekend and he's 

2022
01:28:24,731 --> 01:28:24,830
like,
there's no one like him.

2023
01:28:24,831 --> 01:28:26,060
He goes,
because he loses,

2024
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,610
he doesn't lose any support.
Like not.

2025
01:28:28,611 --> 01:28:33,611
It doesn't change anything and people 
respect the fact that he took a chance 

2026
01:28:33,611 --> 01:28:35,940
and fought mayweather like can.
Can I ask you a Fanboy,

2027
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:40,970
a UFC question?
So it sounds like core may last Jon 

2028
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:40,970
Jones,
right?

2029
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:45,860
Is that okay?
Any last [inaudible] Jon Jones was on 

2030
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:45,860
whatever,
right?

2031
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:45,860
Yes.
I mean,

2032
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:50,291
how does a guy like that?
I'm asking more of a psychological 

2033
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:50,291
question because he's obviously he's a 
great fighter.

2034
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:53,990
How do you sort of process that?
Well,

2035
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:59,030
I mean you have to really wonder why it 
hasn't been established.

2036
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,500
What happened?
Right.

2037
01:29:01,501 --> 01:29:02,010
So there's a lot

2038
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,020
of speculation.
I don't know if you know the recent most

2039
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:05,970
recent speculation that I talked about 
the other day,

2040
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:10,971
but the most recent speculation is that 
John might have snorted cocaine.

2041
01:29:11,221 --> 01:29:16,221
That was cut with creatine that was 
contaminated with steroids because if 

2042
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:19,690
you look at the timeline,
I know you look at the timeline,

2043
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:24,730
John loves some cocaine,
but if you look at the timeline of when 

2044
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:27,960
John tested negative and when John 
tested positive,

2045
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:32,961
it is preposterous to think that he 
thought that he could take it and not 

2046
01:29:32,961 --> 01:29:37,080
passed,
but the fight coincides with 10 days out

2047
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:40,470
from his birthday party where he 
apparently got blitzkrieg.

2048
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:43,780
So it is entirely possible.
Right?

2049
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,800
That,
and this is just massive speculation,

2050
01:29:46,801 --> 01:29:51,801
but we have done some research online 
and found that there have been cases of 

2051
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:55,650
creatine that was contaminated.
We buy cheap creatine from China,

2052
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:59,550
contaminated with steroids,
specifically the type of steroid that he

2053
01:29:59,551 --> 01:30:04,551
tested positive for and create is often 
use to cut cocaine apparently,

2054
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:11,360
so it is entirely possible that he did 
blow and that blow had steroids in it 

2055
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:14,670
through the contaminated creatine and 
gave it back to cormay.

2056
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,420
So core me a lost.
The question is,

2057
01:30:18,421 --> 01:30:23,010
did he lose because Jon Jones is a 
cheater or did he lose?

2058
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:28,011
Because Jon Jones is an amazing fighter,
so the second one would be harder to 

2059
01:30:28,831 --> 01:30:32,160
deal with because if you lost.
Because Jon Jones is an amazing fighter,

2060
01:30:32,161 --> 01:30:37,161
did coq 10 days out before their title 
fight and kicked his ass and now they 

2061
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:42,210
give Daniel the title back.
It's very weird,

2062
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:44,260
but that's why I was asking more as a 
fan,

2063
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:49,140
like a psychological perspective,
a real fucking lie detector test.

2064
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,520
That's what we need.
We do not.

2065
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:55,550
We,
we value honesty so much and there's 

2066
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:59,870
very little other than some rudimentary 
observations they can make with Mri,

2067
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,280
functional magnetic imaging,
a resonance imaging,

2068
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:08,820
which do you want to be lie detect this.
Strap me up,

2069
01:31:08,821 --> 01:31:10,470
man.
That'd be a good podcast.

2070
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:15,560
I try to tell the truth,
have you done that podcast as much as 

2071
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:15,560
humanly possible ever been?

2072
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:20,010
Have you ever like,
have you ever thought about so and so in

2073
01:31:20,011 --> 01:31:25,011
a particular way at the opportunity to 
expose things that I think are fucked up

2074
01:31:25,051 --> 01:31:26,790
about me,
but that one,

2075
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,380
um,
I mean,

2076
01:31:28,381 --> 01:31:31,080
when it comes to like cheating in combat
sports,

2077
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:35,250
it has such an intense significance to 
it that's not,

2078
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:40,410
it's not an option or it's not a,
it's not a factor in other sports is 

2079
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:41,940
that you can cause damage to your 
opponent,

2080
01:31:41,941 --> 01:31:44,360
like physical damage that could affect 
them for the rest of their lives.

2081
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:49,510
Right?
Like that was the case with Vito 

2082
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:49,510
Belfort,
when he fought Michael Bisping,

2083
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:53,900
he had kicked bisping and knocked him 
out and bisping suffered a really badly 

2084
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,921
detached retina in his eye and went on 
to have several surgeries and now has 

2085
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:01,510
oil in his eye.
Like if you look at his eye,

2086
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:06,610
there's permanent oil to protect his 
retina that he has to leave in there 

2087
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:07,540
until he decides to quit fighting.

2088
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,190
And then I'll have another surgery on 
it.

2089
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And the question is,
did Vitol or land that because he's 

2090
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,761
highly skilled,
or did he land it because it's highly 

2091
01:32:17,761 --> 01:32:20,230
skilled and taking testosterone,
it's you're,

2092
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:25,380
you're,
you increase your ability to cause 

2093
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:26,530
damage and that changes the game.
It's not like hitting a baseball.

2094
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,880
If a guy's on steroids and he hits a 
baseball and his team won or your team 

2095
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,771
lost,
I get how the team would be upset that 

2096
01:32:34,771 --> 01:32:36,160
he's a cheater,
but it's just not the same impact.

2097
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:39,220
It doesn't have the same ramifications 
here.

2098
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:44,221
Well,
especially when you're talking about 

2099
01:32:44,221 --> 01:32:45,541
like the angle of the punch and 10th of 
a second being the difference between a 

2100
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:48,790
glancing blow and a knockout.
Yeah.

2101
01:32:48,791 --> 01:32:53,140
And that's what's so crazy is like you 
get into this fractional idea of what is

2102
01:32:53,141 --> 01:32:56,410
just [inaudible].
There's so many factors or speed.

2103
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:58,480
There's the amount of energy that you 
have.

2104
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:01,090
And then their psychological factors 
like confidence.

2105
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:04,960
There's no,
there's no metric to figure out what,

2106
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:09,280
what kind of an effect being juiced up 
psychopath has.

2107
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:14,550
Like if you're someone who like Vito 
Belfort who is already highly skilled 

2108
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:16,270
and then you pump them full of steroids 
and he comes out to like,

2109
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:21,280
motherfucker,
like he just feels like he can't lose 

2110
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,290
and that he has so much confidence and 
then all this skill on top of that,

2111
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,870
the seat he's,
I hate to pick on him,

2112
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:30,871
but he's my favorite example because the
difference between him on testosterone 

2113
01:33:30,871 --> 01:33:35,260
and him off testosterone is so radical.
Like there has been these photos side to

2114
01:33:35,261 --> 01:33:37,110
side or the two of them together and 
you're just like,

2115
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:42,450
wow.
Like it's like they're one of them's a 

2116
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:42,520
destroyer.
The other one is a dad,

2117
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:44,710
like he's a dad bod,
you know,

2118
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:45,760
it's,
it's weird.

2119
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:51,580
So if that's the case with John Jones,
will you want to pull it up as a related

2120
01:33:51,581 --> 01:33:53,620
breaking story right now?
Oh yeah.

2121
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:56,100
There's two to breaking stories in the 
MMA world right now.

2122
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:57,840
But this one,
since you're talking about it,

2123
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:02,710
Anderson Silva fails out of us.
UFC Shanghai main event.

2124
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:04,270
Make sense?
He's 40.

2125
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:07,240
What did he fail for?
A sample?

2126
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:11,440
A sample b test that failed from October
26th collection.

2127
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:13,270
Huh?
So it was a couple of weeks ago.

2128
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:19,890
That's interesting.
From a sample beet test sample sample 

2129
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:19,890
collected.
Oh,

2130
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:24,810
okay.
It didn't say the actual drug because 

2131
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:25,330
they don't test sample b unless sample a
is.

2132
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:27,550
Well,
I'm not surprised.

2133
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:28,950
This is the other thing going on.
Right.

2134
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:31,470
Conor mcgregor jumps the cage at Bella 
tour when he's seven.

2135
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,130
Conference referee.
Mark Goddard.

2136
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,710
Oh yeah,
I heard about that.

2137
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:38,200
Definitely don't do that.
Yeah.

2138
01:34:38,201 --> 01:34:40,510
I don't know what that was about.
I don't know why he did that.

2139
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:41,980
Yeah.
You liked that.

2140
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:46,120
I've already.
I'm already booked in the main event.

2141
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:49,330
How do you have time for that wrestling 
stuff?

2142
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:51,910
Just so I just make time.
Make time.

2143
01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:52,650
Because you enjoy it.
Yeah.

2144
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:53,170
Love it.
Yeah.

2145
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:59,930
For all this fucking emo kids that are 
just massive smashing pumpkins.

2146
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:04,950
Fastest.
There's so many of them that that must 

2147
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:04,950
drive them nuts.
Yeah.

2148
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:06,860
That's part of it.
That's wrestling tough shit,

2149
01:35:06,861 --> 01:35:08,030
right?
It is what it is.

2150
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:10,340
Yeah.
So to answer your question,

2151
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:12,740
Daniel Cormier is an awesome guy.
I mean,

2152
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:17,741
it really breaks my heart when I see 
people get upset and boo him don't like 

2153
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:20,840
him.
I just don't think they know him and for

2154
01:35:20,841 --> 01:35:25,580
whatever reason he is mean to be 
completely honest.

2155
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:30,730
He's always going to be in the shadow of
the greatest light heavyweight champion 

2156
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:30,730
of all time.
And that's John John's the greatest.

2157
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:35,710
I mean he's,
he's so uniquely talented and special 

2158
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:39,820
and just there's something about him all
across the board and part of his 

2159
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,920
partying and all that shit is kind of 
connected to that because he's fucking 

2160
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:48,281
wild and it's one of the reasons why 
when he fought shogun for the title,

2161
01:35:48,561 --> 01:35:53,561
he was 23 years old.
He opens the fight with a flying knee 

2162
01:35:53,561 --> 01:35:56,570
who fights a legend like Mauricio Shogun
who,

2163
01:35:56,571 --> 01:36:01,571
uh,
who was one of the greatest ever and 

2164
01:36:01,571 --> 01:36:02,660
pride,
former light heavyweight champion at the

2165
01:36:02,661 --> 01:36:05,300
time.
John Jones fights him,

2166
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:09,650
is 23 years old and is opening move is a
flying knee that lands.

2167
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:10,850
I mean,
he's just,

2168
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:15,770
he's uniquely improvisational creative,
wild,

2169
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:17,720
talented,
physically,

2170
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:22,750
incredibly dominant,
very strong kind of crazy body for the 

2171
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:22,750
game.
Like,

2172
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:23,920
yeah,
the long,

2173
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,320
long thing.
Strong though,

2174
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:29,800
he's not frail,
like the difference between John is he's

2175
01:36:29,801 --> 01:36:33,220
got long limbs.
Buddy has that strong wrestling base,

2176
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:37,530
so even though he's a thin guy,
he's very physically strong.

2177
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:40,060
Strange comparison to make,
but back in the day,

2178
01:36:40,061 --> 01:36:43,150
used to hang out a lot with Dennis 
Rodman when he was playing for the Bulls

2179
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:46,150
and he had freakish strength,
kind of similar bonding,

2180
01:36:46,151 --> 01:36:51,151
looked very long like you wouldn't look 
at them and think muscles and Rodman 

2181
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:56,431
could pick a 250 pound,
may end up with one hand and lift them 

2182
01:36:56,431 --> 01:37:00,030
over a rope.
I saw him do it at a club that was 

2183
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:01,240
acting up and Dennis just rich over.
The guy picked him up like this.

2184
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,270
And then even people would remember NBA 
fans.

2185
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:09,360
Uh,
Dennis used to guard the guard shack one

2186
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:10,990
on one.
Yeah.

2187
01:37:11,490 --> 01:37:12,680
And that was when chuck was,
what,

2188
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,740
3:40
years Dennis.

2189
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,120
And that was when they had the whole 
thing.

2190
01:37:16,121 --> 01:37:18,550
You couldn't use your hand yet at the 
elbow and all that stuff.

2191
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:21,430
He got them one on one freakish 
strength.

2192
01:37:21,431 --> 01:37:22,330
And you're like,
you look at him,

2193
01:37:22,331 --> 01:37:23,650
you think,
how is that possible?

2194
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:26,020
Some guys just have that weird 
[inaudible],

2195
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:29,260
whatever that is.
It's a lot of times it's those long guys

2196
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:33,430
to something is about long limbs and 
leverage and it's like they have to,

2197
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,540
if they have long as they have a certain
amount of muscle with that long,

2198
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:39,610
those long limbs and longer than 
average.

2199
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:40,600
I mean,
look at this look.

2200
01:37:40,601 --> 01:37:42,840
Okay.
Freakish in this,

2201
01:37:42,841 --> 01:37:47,841
you know,
this is like the air I'm hanging out 

2202
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:47,841
with Dennis.
I mean,

2203
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:47,841
look at Dennis this size compared to 
Shaq.

2204
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:49,720
You.
If you didn't know it was Dennis Rodman.

2205
01:37:49,721 --> 01:37:51,030
It was just some,
you know,

2206
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,450
NBA Scrub,
right?

2207
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:55,230
You would think there's no way that 
guy's going to guard him one on one.

2208
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:57,840
Especially Shaq in his prime there.
There's no way.

2209
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:02,220
Yeah,
it's a crazy guy.

2210
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,110
Interesting.
Speaking crazy.

2211
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:06,510
I tell you a funny story.
You got a good story.

2212
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:11,540
Yeah.
So used to hang out a lot with Dennis 

2213
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:11,540
and uh,
you know,

2214
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:16,190
hadn't seen him for years.
Was at a restaurant in Chicago not too 

2215
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:18,330
long ago and um,
and somebody said,

2216
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:19,890
oh,
you guys are friends with Dennis,

2217
01:38:19,891 --> 01:38:20,370
right?
Yeah.

2218
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:20,940
Yeah.
Oh,

2219
01:38:20,941 --> 01:38:22,330
he's upstairs.
Oh really?

2220
01:38:22,331 --> 01:38:23,790
We go upstairs,
Dennis's crying.

2221
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,110
Oh my God,
I miss you guys.

2222
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:29,430
Me and my buddy were hanging out with.
I'm telling old stories,

2223
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,450
you know,
seven or eight years,

2224
01:38:30,451 --> 01:38:31,830
haven't seen him.
This is great.

2225
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:32,240
Like,
uh,

2226
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:37,310
when you see a buddy you really love and
it's really affectionate and Dennis is 

2227
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:39,210
one of those people at some point he 
just gets up and he wanders away.

2228
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,670
I think he's going to take a piss.
Okay.

2229
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,310
About 10 minutes goes by,
I say to the waitress.

2230
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:45,450
To Dennis leave.
Yeah,

2231
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:46,890
he left.
Okay.

2232
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,900
I just figured he's gone.
It's just the way he is.

2233
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,670
He wouldn't even say goodbye.
Just gone.

2234
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,280
I get up the next morning I turned the 
television,

2235
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,020
Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.

2236
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:58,740
I,
by the way,

2237
01:38:58,741 --> 01:39:00,690
I spent an hour and a half with them.
He didn't say anything.

2238
01:39:00,691 --> 01:39:01,950
We'd go about going in North Korea.
Right.

2239
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:05,130
So I turned on the television.
It's like very controversial.

2240
01:39:05,131 --> 01:39:09,510
Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.
So I texted my buddy and I say,

2241
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:15,270
have you seen the news now what I say,
turn on the television.

2242
01:39:15,271 --> 01:39:16,230
And he said,
what channel?

2243
01:39:16,231 --> 01:39:17,430
I said,
it doesn't matter.

2244
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:23,520
Two minutes goes by holy fuck,
because he went through the same thing,

2245
01:39:23,521 --> 01:39:25,500
you know?
Wow.

2246
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:30,560
Yeah.
What is his deal with that North Korean 

2247
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,811
dude,
he just goes over there and hangs out 

2248
01:39:32,811 --> 01:39:33,230
with them and really a genuine,
uh,

2249
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:35,940
you know,
a naive hearted person.

2250
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:41,200
So in my best understanding is he truly 
believes he can affect the world in a 

2251
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,800
positive way.
So there's dentists,

2252
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:47,430
there's not a bad bone in Dennis's body.
Dennis has his issues,

2253
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:49,140
but he's not a bad hearted guy.

2254
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:52,440
So in his kind of crazy ideological 
frame,

2255
01:39:52,441 --> 01:39:57,441
he actually thinks he's helping,
so he thinks he can go over there and 

2256
01:39:57,441 --> 01:39:58,820
talk some sense into that guy or by 
playing basketball open,

2257
01:39:58,821 --> 01:39:59,580
you know,
whatever.

2258
01:39:59,581 --> 01:40:00,910
He's.
Yeah,

2259
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,450
I mean,
so that's not a good shot.

2260
01:40:03,451 --> 01:40:04,200
I mean,
you know what I mean?

2261
01:40:04,201 --> 01:40:05,860
It's not a good look,
but yeah,

2262
01:40:05,861 --> 01:40:10,861
I mean he's hanging around with a 
murderer as dictator hoping for the 

2263
01:40:10,861 --> 01:40:13,671
best.
But that's what I mean about the 

2264
01:40:13,671 --> 01:40:13,671
naivete.
And I don't mean to cache.

2265
01:40:13,671 --> 01:40:13,830
And Dennis,
I really loved Dennis.

2266
01:40:13,831 --> 01:40:17,190
It's been nothing but a total sweetheart
to mind to me in my life,

2267
01:40:17,191 --> 01:40:22,191
but I gen dennis would in a very naive 
way believe that he's actually helping.

2268
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:25,530
It's a very gangster move to go over 
there though.

2269
01:40:25,710 --> 01:40:28,950
I mean it's just the other side of 
Dennis.

2270
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:30,090
It makes a certain sense.
It's like,

2271
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,260
I'll do it.
Yeah.

2272
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,140
I remember when he was dressing up in 
drag and you know,

2273
01:40:34,141 --> 01:40:39,141
it's like,
I'll be that guy so it's somehow it's 

2274
01:40:39,141 --> 01:40:39,141
sorta works in his.
Again,

2275
01:40:39,141 --> 01:40:43,611
I'm not trying to speak for him,
but he was one of my favorite guys on 

2276
01:40:43,611 --> 01:40:44,750
celebrity rehab because he was working 
out every day drinking water.

2277
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:50,570
I used to go into the bowls locker room 
after games and he would work out after 

2278
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:50,570
games.
Really.

2279
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:57,850
We go in and go [inaudible],
we're going to go out clubbing or 

2280
01:40:57,850 --> 01:41:00,121
whatever and you go in the locker room 
and he'd be working out and we have to 

2281
01:41:00,121 --> 01:41:02,170
sit and wait for him to work out for 
another 40 minutes after the game.

2282
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:05,020
And he played.
It wasn't like he was had a knee injury.

2283
01:41:05,021 --> 01:41:10,021
I mean he played the whole game.
Like what kind of workouts do you like 

2284
01:41:10,021 --> 01:41:12,230
lifting weights or something treadmill,
you know,

2285
01:41:12,231 --> 01:41:13,520
whatever,
whatever he was doing,

2286
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:15,980
why I wasn't.
It wasn't like light stretching.

2287
01:41:15,981 --> 01:41:20,981
It was like the energizer bunny.
And then we go out and stay out all 

2288
01:41:20,981 --> 01:41:20,981
night.

2289
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,110
Jesus,
they quick.

2290
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:26,470
You want a quick story?
So I'm hanging out with the bowls.

2291
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:28,470
It's the first time they're playing 
Utah.

2292
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:31,030
Um,
they,

2293
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:32,910
it's a very,
it's a,

2294
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,900
it's a series of bolts probably should 
have lost,

2295
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,240
but they didn't.
It's the famous game where,

2296
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:42,320
uh,
the famous series where Michael had the 

2297
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:42,320
flu and scored 36 points.
I know if you know that game,

2298
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:47,311
it's one of the most famous games.
Michael legit had crazy flu and scored 

2299
01:41:47,311 --> 01:41:47,770
36 and they won the game and they won 
the series.

2300
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:52,570
So in between one of those games,
Dennis knows some billionaire,

2301
01:41:53,570 --> 01:41:58,570
there's a day off,
we get on the billionaires plane and we 

2302
01:41:58,570 --> 01:41:59,680
fly to Vegas.
We stay out all night gambling.

2303
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:01,250
And this is Dennis,
like,

2304
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:06,990
you know,
rubbing dice on people's bodies and 

2305
01:42:06,990 --> 01:42:06,990
throwing the dice.
So drunk they're balancing out of the,

2306
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,140
you know,
the craps pit.

2307
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,660
And I mean just total mess and you're 
thinking,

2308
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,730
how is this going to help us win a 
championship?

2309
01:42:12,731 --> 01:42:17,731
Very much a fan mentality.
I'm thinking naively I'm going to kind 

2310
01:42:17,731 --> 01:42:21,130
of reign them in so.
So we stay out all night.

2311
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,980
We'd get up,
we'd never go to bed.

2312
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:27,730
We get,
we fly on the private plane,

2313
01:42:27,731 --> 01:42:32,320
back to make the morning press shoot 
around back in Utah.

2314
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:38,010
So we've only been,
we've only been in vegas for like eight 

2315
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:38,010
hours.
So 9:00

2316
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:38,740
AM.
I'm sitting in the stands.

2317
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:42,550
I haven't slept at all.
They do the whatever,

2318
01:42:42,551 --> 01:42:45,910
the shoot around and Dennis walks up and
says let's go back,

2319
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:49,690
go back where the hotel.
No let's go back to Vegas.

2320
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:55,560
So after the morning shoot around,
drove to the airport to fly commercial 

2321
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:59,521
because now the billionaires not sliding
them back again and gets on a plane 

2322
01:42:59,521 --> 01:43:02,170
commercial and it's given me shit 
because I don't want to go back to vegas

2323
01:43:02,171 --> 01:43:02,560
with him.

2324
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:07,300
Jesus kron the off day and this is 
during the NBA,

2325
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:11,050
the NBA finals.
So through some sort of weird,

2326
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:14,050
you know how the world works.
I ended up somewhere,

2327
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:17,770
I don't play,
I go to play miniature golf or something

2328
01:43:17,771 --> 01:43:22,771
in Park City,
Utah where the bowls were staying and 

2329
01:43:22,771 --> 01:43:25,381
Phil Jackson and his family's had just 
happened to be there on like an off day 

2330
01:43:25,381 --> 01:43:29,010
and Phil has given me the look of death 
because I'm the one responsible for 

2331
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:33,541
dentists go into Vegas.
The rockstar dragged on the bad guy and 

2332
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:34,930
I'm thinking,
you don't understand.

2333
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:38,590
I'm the one to tell him not to go.
I want to win a championship or at least

2334
01:43:38,591 --> 01:43:40,990
have one now.
What are you gonna say to Phil Jackson?

2335
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:44,350
Have you ever met Phil Jackson?
Phil Jackson is an intimidating guy.

2336
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:48,280
He plays very zen on tv,
but in person.

2337
01:43:48,281 --> 01:43:49,840
He's very intimidating.
Six,

2338
01:43:49,850 --> 01:43:50,950
seven,
six,

2339
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,120
eight,
and he was legitimately upset at you.

2340
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:59,330
Let's just say it wasn't a nice 
encounter and I love Phil Jackson.

2341
01:43:59,331 --> 01:44:00,770
I mean,
I loved those years.

2342
01:44:00,771 --> 01:44:03,830
I love those teams and I was lucky to be
around them a lot.

2343
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:04,910
I used to say,
look,

2344
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:07,760
watching this teams like 19,
27 Yankees,

2345
01:44:07,761 --> 01:44:12,761
I mean you will look back very fondly on
this time and to even be in that bubble 

2346
01:44:12,761 --> 01:44:14,810
at all and it was awesome.
But yeah,

2347
01:44:14,811 --> 01:44:18,800
I mean catch and shade from Phil Jackson
at the height of the Bolus thing.

2348
01:44:18,801 --> 01:44:21,160
It was just so funny and I'm playing 
miniature golf and you know,

2349
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:23,960
this is so uncomfortable.
That is hilarious.

2350
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,540
Do you still keep in touch with Dennis 
now?

2351
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:31,541
Dennis is sort of.
He kind of tried it out into the ether 

2352
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:31,541
and I,
you know,

2353
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:33,800
it's hard to follow it.
It under my thing.

2354
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:36,050
It falls under what I call the celeb 
friendship.

2355
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:40,100
I've had various times had to.
I tried to have friendships,

2356
01:44:40,101 --> 01:44:44,630
legitimate friendships with very famous 
people and the way they run their worlds

2357
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:46,580
is.
I'm sure you've encountered.

2358
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:48,680
It's like,
it's like you got to go through this guy

2359
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:51,470
to talk to this guy and then the message
doesn't get through and I think,

2360
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,880
oh fuck all that.
I'm not doing that.

2361
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,810
Yeah,
I don't.

2362
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,690
If I can't just text you.
I can't be friends with.

2363
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,810
Yeah.
It gets into the weird thing of like,

2364
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:04,050
you tell Larry the guy and then Larry 
never tells the guy and then the guy's 

2365
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:06,010
upset at Larry,
but Larry's looking at you like,

2366
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:08,400
yeah,
we had to go do this thing and I just,

2367
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:09,610
I can't do any of that.

2368
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:11,550
Yeah.
There's a few guys that are like that,

2369
01:45:11,551 --> 01:45:12,660
right?
There's a few.

2370
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:14,010
It's weird.
It's,

2371
01:45:14,011 --> 01:45:17,940
I feel like when someone reaches a 
certain level of success,

2372
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:19,570
especially fame,
uh,

2373
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:24,770
they,
they get people to sort of handle 

2374
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:27,180
certain menial tasks and then that 
person sort of becomes their babysitter.

2375
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:34,030
Yeah.
I have very few friends that are famous 

2376
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:34,290
and it's one on one.
Yeah.

2377
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:35,370
Or forget it.
No,

2378
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:37,340
the with David.
If I'm a fan.

2379
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,410
I mean there are people I've,
you know,

2380
01:45:39,411 --> 01:45:43,250
I could call them up kind of thing that,
I mean they're like my absolute idols,

2381
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:45,380
but if I can't have that rapport,
it's like,

2382
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:46,160
forget it.
It's just,

2383
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,860
it's almost too weird.
It's like,

2384
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:53,140
because why then am I,
am I a fan guy hanging around hope and 

2385
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:55,220
he's going to throw me a bone and talk 
to me about their second album.

2386
01:45:55,221 --> 01:46:00,221
You know,
and it's like it gets into that kind of 

2387
01:46:00,221 --> 01:46:00,221
uncomfortable space.
You're,

2388
01:46:00,221 --> 01:46:00,290
you're making the same mistake.
I don't want people to make.

2389
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:05,860
I don't want people around me.
Like some of my friends were in the 

2390
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,961
room.
They talked to me like I'm the guy from 

2391
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:09,080
Glendale Heights.
Like there's no star trip with me.

2392
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:12,140
Like I want everyone to be straight up.
I don't want any of that.

2393
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:14,090
I don't need it.
Well,

2394
01:46:14,091 --> 01:46:14,620
it's like what you said,
you're

2395
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,820
talking about turning 50,
you know,

2396
01:46:16,821 --> 01:46:18,860
like you're 50,
you don't give a fuck anymore.

2397
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:21,570
It's like that's one of the things I did
give a fuck before 50,

2398
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:22,940
but now you have to declare it.
Yeah.

2399
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:27,920
But it's great that you are willing to 
be this guy and be yourself openly.

2400
01:46:27,921 --> 01:46:31,040
Because one of the things about music in
particular,

2401
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:33,410
but I guess a lot of other areas of show
business too,

2402
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:37,310
is that people really protect that 
image.

2403
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:39,980
They protect that brand,
they protect that,

2404
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:42,260
that thing that they're projecting to 
their fans,

2405
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:46,610
they have this idea what their fans want
and they hold that really sacred.

2406
01:46:46,611 --> 01:46:49,890
But I think pulling the curtain back the
way you do,

2407
01:46:49,891 --> 01:46:49,980
I

2408
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,300
think it's very brave,
but it's also very

2409
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:57,440
port.
I've certainly had moments in my life 

2410
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:01,131
where I,
I wondered if I had it to do all over 

2411
01:47:01,131 --> 01:47:01,131
again.
Like sometimes I'll,

2412
01:47:01,131 --> 01:47:01,200
I'll,
I'll riff with a,

2413
01:47:01,201 --> 01:47:06,201
like a,
a journalist that I know enough to sort 

2414
01:47:06,201 --> 01:47:06,930
of riff with and I say because sometimes
they'll say like,

2415
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:12,440
do you feel you're under appreciated as 
an artist or you didn't feel you didn't 

2416
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:12,570
get to do you to serve?
And I'm like,

2417
01:47:12,571 --> 01:47:13,810
yeah,
that's absolutely.

2418
01:47:13,811 --> 01:47:16,230
And maybe everybody feels that way,
but I certainly feel that way.

2419
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:19,640
And so my little funny,
a sec,

2420
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:24,660
a blog question for them as if I'd never
opened my mouth and all you had on me 

2421
01:47:25,501 --> 01:47:28,160
was my music.
Would you have a different opinion?

2422
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,520
And they say they always say the same 
thing.

2423
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:32,190
Absolutely.
That's weird,

2424
01:47:32,191 --> 01:47:32,820
right?
Yeah.

2425
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,840
So did my mouth,
you know,

2426
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:36,510
boot me down.
Yeah.

2427
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,420
Ladder.
You know what I mean?

2428
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:39,090
I don't know.
It's,

2429
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:40,790
it's fun to play.
It's like a part of the game.

2430
01:47:40,791 --> 01:47:41,760
It's too late now.
I mean,

2431
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:46,940
I think it's a different opinion,
but it's not a lesser or greater 

2432
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:46,940
opinion.
I mean,

2433
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:49,010
my opinion of you is greater seeing that
you are very open,

2434
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,170
honest.
But if I knew you,

2435
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:54,470
like if I didn't know you have your 
music.

2436
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:55,280
Oh go.
Oh,

2437
01:47:55,281 --> 01:47:56,810
he's a regular guy.
He'd been.

2438
01:47:56,811 --> 01:47:59,790
A lot of people don't like that.
They don't like regular guys know.

2439
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,270
It's a fantasy world.
Yeah.

2440
01:48:02,271 --> 01:48:03,920
That's part of the music business,
right?

2441
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:06,890
Yeah.
I got to ask you this one thing for sure

2442
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:09,770
is because I read this and I was like,
what?

2443
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,670
Here we go,
uh,

2444
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,840
you saw someone shapeshift Oh God.
Is it,

2445
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:22,070
is that really where you fucking with 
people?

2446
01:48:22,071 --> 01:48:23,310
That's true.
Really.

2447
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:28,320
It's true.
Because when you told me joy Kaufman 

2448
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:28,370
like moments,
I was like,

2449
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:28,730
okay.
No,

2450
01:48:28,731 --> 01:48:29,510
no,
it's true.

2451
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,170
I would tell you off grade,
but I won't say it publicly.

2452
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:34,480
Really.
The only way I'd say it publicly as if I

2453
01:48:34,481 --> 01:48:38,320
write it and I've been writing this book
for years and it's in the book really.

2454
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,930
So I'd tell you off grid,
but I can't get.

2455
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,740
Look,
I know Alex Jones sat in the seat,

2456
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:48,840
right?
I know you've been on it for wars.

2457
01:48:48,841 --> 01:48:51,990
I've been in I think three or four 
times.

2458
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:56,240
Well,
what have you been on them for?

2459
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:56,750
Is for.

2460
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:59,850
I'm mostly talking about free speech.
I think that's,

2461
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:01,860
I think that's one thing that,
that,

2462
01:49:01,890 --> 01:49:03,330
um,
is,

2463
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:06,390
is critical and alternative media is to 
fight that.

2464
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:09,720
That's a frontline issue for me.
Yeah.

2465
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:12,010
This demonetizing,
uh,

2466
01:49:12,011 --> 01:49:16,910
people's videos and trying to censor 
messages and even how in to twitter exec

2467
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:21,920
just recently admitted in front of 
Congress how they were suppressing a 

2468
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,070
negative hillary hashtags and stuff.
I mean,

2469
01:49:23,071 --> 01:49:24,540
that's crazy to me.
Yes,

2470
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:29,930
I think so too.
That like you got some of you openly 

2471
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:29,930
saying,
yeah,

2472
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:29,930
we were,
you know,

2473
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:31,830
if we're going to sit here and go on and
on about Russian collusion,

2474
01:49:31,831 --> 01:49:35,280
I mean,
is that not an in kind donation,

2475
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:40,450
will you?
You're manipulating people's ability to 

2476
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:40,450
change it.
So as an artist who's been in the public

2477
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:45,201
sphere almost 30 years and I've seen 
people manipulate my image and turn me 

2478
01:49:45,201 --> 01:49:49,251
into a meme and all this stuff,
I'm very sensitive to if somebody wants 

2479
01:49:49,251 --> 01:49:53,161
to deny me the right to re to either 
reply or get my message out,

2480
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:56,590
right?
As long as we have that ability,

2481
01:49:56,591 --> 01:50:01,591
I trust our democracy.
We need people like you and me and 

2482
01:50:01,591 --> 01:50:04,600
anybody else like great.
I think our democracy is better for it.

2483
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,960
And that includes the people who say 
things that I don't approve of or like 

2484
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:10,060
I'd rather have them say it than not 
safe.

2485
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:15,180
I agree as well.
And I think it's very important that if 

2486
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:17,010
people do say those things that you 
don't approve of or like that other 

2487
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:20,440
people express why they don't approve of
those things are like them.

2488
01:50:20,441 --> 01:50:22,960
And the only way that happens is if you 
hear the initial thought,

2489
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:26,170
you have to hear the one thing that you 
don't like in order for someone to say,

2490
01:50:26,171 --> 01:50:27,760
saying something that resonates,
you go,

2491
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:32,761
yes.
That's why we disagree with that 

2492
01:50:32,761 --> 01:50:32,761
initiative.

2493
01:50:32,761 --> 01:50:32,761
Okay.
So to use any personnel,

2494
01:50:32,761 --> 01:50:34,010
if we,
if we generally agree,

2495
01:50:34,011 --> 01:50:39,011
than an idea is so aborad or so racist 
are so bigoted than what are we afraid 

2496
01:50:39,951 --> 01:50:44,951
of because the argument should be that 
the collective agrees that that is an 

2497
01:50:45,951 --> 01:50:50,270
inappropriate thing to do and express 
and then socially we can sort of correct

2498
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:53,690
course and it gives the other person on 
the other side the opportunity to course

2499
01:50:53,691 --> 01:50:56,870
correct to yes.
In essence,

2500
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:02,020
if you're not,
if you're so sure of an idea of being 

2501
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:02,020
true,
what are you afraid of?

2502
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:06,700
Why can that idea not withstand the 
dirtiest most scurrilous thing that can 

2503
01:51:06,921 --> 01:51:07,520
be thrown at it?

2504
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:12,990
Yeah.
It's one of the more uncomfortable 

2505
01:51:12,990 --> 01:51:14,551
things about people on the left today is
this newly embraced idea that you should

2506
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:16,960
be able to suppress ideas you don't 
agree with.

2507
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:18,880
That's terrifying.
It is terrifying.

2508
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:19,780
It's terrifying.
I agree.

2509
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:25,200
I mean,
let's wrap this up so I could hear your 

2510
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:25,200
shape shifts or.
Sorry,

2511
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:25,200
I want to Elena,
hear that man.

2512
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:26,500
It's.
Let's put it this way.

2513
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,330
It's pretty wild.
I believe you.

2514
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,910
I just the people.
I will.

2515
01:51:30,911 --> 01:51:31,630
I will.
I will.

2516
01:51:31,631 --> 01:51:32,980
Someday.
You'll put it in a book.

2517
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:34,270
Yeah.
So,

2518
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:37,240
uh,
please tell people how they can see you,

2519
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:42,290
the,
the name of your new album where they 

2520
01:51:42,290 --> 01:51:42,290
can get it.

2521
01:51:42,290 --> 01:51:42,820
Uh,
I have an album out solo acoustic Oj,

2522
01:51:42,830 --> 01:51:44,910
Lala produced by Rick Rubin.
Um,

2523
01:51:44,911 --> 01:51:49,911
it just came out about a month ago.
I'm just finishing up my tour dates in 

2524
01:51:49,911 --> 01:51:49,911
La,
so that's pretty much done.

2525
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:55,230
I'm going to go record another acoustic 
album and then hopefully next year 

2526
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:55,230
they'll be a pumpkin.
Stuart.

2527
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:57,450
Awesome.
Our fingers are crossed.

2528
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:58,100
Well,
thank you.

2529
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,330
Thank you.
Thank you.

2530
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:02,040
My pleasure.
All right folks,

2531
01:52:02,070 --> 01:52:02,490
that's it.
