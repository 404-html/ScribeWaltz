1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,700
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,800
Boom.
Tony Rock live.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,360
That's a bold choice in shirts,
sir.

5
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,300
I like that.
Thank you.

6
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,990
I think it brings out my skin tone.
It breaks out.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,450
It's got a pop to it.
Yeah.

8
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,180
And uh,
you know,

9
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,013
a rocket with the shades on so,
and driving windows open and girls are 

10
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,190
looking like,
who's that guy?

11
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:20,971
So yeah,
and you're,

12
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,460
you're an android guy,
you're a different kind of person.

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,530
Android people are different kinds of 
people.

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,483
What kind of people are.
Well the people that like think about 

15
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,570
it.
Like I don't know about this,

16
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,800
you know,
everybody's like,

17
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,110
I need an iphone.
Your iphone,

18
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:33,931
ipad,
android.

19
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:34,764
People like,
Eh,

20
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,870
I'm not so sure.
I think I could rock a pixel this,

21
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,390
this takes great pictures.
It's very easy to figure out.

22
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,243
So I don't know.
I've never been an iphone guy to choice 

23
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:46,260
that people make.

24
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,390
They just decide it's a nonconformance 
choice.

25
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,400
I take the blue pill or the red.
I think they're both like,

26
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,343
it's no denying the iphones are bad ass,
but it's no denying those are basically 

27
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,590
just as bad ass.
That just different.

28
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,150
Everything is just different.
Now,

29
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,170
exactly.
It's caught up.

30
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,110
Go with what you're like,
man.

31
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,083
Yeah.
It used to be like if you had a 

32
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:05,100
blackberry and somebody else on an 
iphone,

33
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:05,934
you felt like a loser.
I felt like a loser with you just to 

34
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:08,394
back people had the phones that you 
could just exactly your number and you 

35
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,360
didn't have one.
You would just ass out.

36
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,243
That's right.
Remember everybody had like a little 

37
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:17,370
laptop.
They send me your number.

38
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,920
You would just scan their phone.
What was that thing called again?

39
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:22,440
A side something or another.
What was that called?

40
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,600
What was it called?
The sidekick.

41
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,110
Was it?
Is that.

42
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,810
What?
Is it called side?

43
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,643
No,
that wasn't.

44
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,670
That was the original drug dealer.
Right?

45
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,180
You sold weed.
You bought a Suzuki sidekick.

46
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,770
You with a man?
Oh,

47
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,903
Tony Rock.
I'm so happy that you agree that the 

48
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:39,270
fanny pack is back.
The fanny pack is back.

49
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,800
It is right.
If any packets back.

50
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,050
It's a little more stylish fanny pack.
Now people are wearing shoulder.

51
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,050
That's the coward's way out.
That's a coward.

52
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:47,910
You still want it on the stomach.
Yeah.

53
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:50,940
You rock it right in front of you.
That's where it's most convenient.

54
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,543
Say Boys,
you don't have to be trying to get laid 

55
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,340
all the time of relapse.
You want soccer,

56
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:56,910
dad?
Look,

57
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,240
you just want the convenience of having 
that bag right there.

58
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,450
Why can't I leather?
I don't want to have to carry shit.

59
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:03,420
If you want leather.
Fuck.

60
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,360
Yeah.
You want a name like Fendi or Gucci?

61
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,190
Cross this right here,
Bro.

62
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,780
Oh Wow.
That's nice,

63
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:10,480
right?
Yeah.

64
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,540
That's very nice.
That's very naked and afraid.

65
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,120
Wish you could keep this shit on.
You feel uncomfortable.

66
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,570
You got your keys.
You got your phone.

67
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,610
You don't think about shit.
I got keys.

68
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,630
Phone,
wallet in my pocket.

69
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:23,820
I'm good.
People are tired of hearing about this,

70
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,470
but I'm telling you it's the way to go 
to pack his bags.

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,370
I got one that I wear when I run.
Oh,

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,710
so you have more than one?
Yeah,

73
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,300
I've got.
I've got a neoprene one.

74
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,280
You have the running fanny packs.
Dude.

75
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,110
It's nice.
You slip your phone in there.

76
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,690
Get a little headsets on.
You can cheat with your music.

77
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:40,620
Jamie.
I've been cheating.

78
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,960
I cheat when I run.
Now I listen to music.

79
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,550
It's better.
You guys were all right.

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,490
How's that cheating?
I used to say that if you run,

81
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,970
if you ran running,
especially running hills is difficult,

82
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,280
so you should do it with no music.

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,080
You shouldn't be like,
you just zone out.

84
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,220
Just fucking do the work that I get it a
couple of times with music.

85
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,100
I'm like,
this is way better.

86
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,580
Yeah,
I think you're supposed to.

87
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,640
You supposed to hear a little,
you know something that gets you going.

88
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,870
Yeah,
it's way better.

89
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,090
It's way better treadmill.
You get on the treadmill,

90
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,620
just music go.
Yeah.

91
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,590
You just got to hear it.
As long as it's not too loud.

92
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,030
The thing about running in the 
mountains,

93
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,100
it's like,
what if someone's screaming for help and

94
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:20,101
you know you're running by there already
in the mountains and the they need help.

95
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,180
There's nothing you can do already.
This Laurel Canyon,

96
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,470
you know what?
If you just run it up,

97
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:30,070
the candidate to be a good person,
if they where they need help,

98
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,870
they need you to help them take an 
instagram picture.

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,233
Probably in Laurel Canyon,
half of the people there just like I to 

100
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:36,814
get a good shot.

101
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,090
I know how many people hike just to get 
a good shot at the top.

102
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,550
It's good instagram photo a lot.
You can get a lot of likes.

103
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,260
Yeah.
That's where they go for.

104
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,790
They go for the legs.
Hey.

105
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,050
It's some sort of commodity seems to be 
right.

106
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,360
Uh,
if you're,

107
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,510
if you're a girl with a,
with a nice body,

108
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,470
a bunch of likes seems to translate into
a hosting parties for some reason.

109
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,730
Oh yeah,
that's right.

110
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,470
Yeah.
You only have a certain amount.

111
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,970
Yeah.
You go to a club and it's hosted tonight

112
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,410
by like,
who is,

113
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,820
who the fuck is this girl?
Well,

114
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,650
it's the minimalist approach,
right?

115
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,390
It's like not only is it not,
she doesn't display a talent,

116
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,990
but you also don't even hear a talk.
He just see the pictures.

117
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,130
But just that enough is enough that 
people are going to want to go see it.

118
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,400
It takes less and less and less and less
to be a celebrity these days.

119
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,750
That's a strange one though,
isn't it?

120
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,450
To be considered a celebrity.
Yeah.

121
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:25,800
That's,
uh,

122
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,633
that's one of the weirder ones.
One of the weirder ones is getting down 

123
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:31,580
to just being famous for photographs.
Yeah.

124
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,790
They call them instagram models.
So there's an instagram modeling agency,

125
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,863
but here's the thing,
am I hate her for saying that because I 

126
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:43,180
like to look at them,
be upset.

127
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,170
I appreciate you ever at someone who's 
making something that I like to look at.

128
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,843
Right?
There you go.

129
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,460
I'm not mad weird that people would be 
like,

130
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,520
fuck these instagram posts.
They're big ass isn't okay,

131
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,690
but don't you want to see those 
pictures?

132
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,100
I love to see the pictures and I think 
those are the guys.

133
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,460
Those are the guys that they're not 
fucking medicine that,

134
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,110
you know,
we're all hypocrites.

135
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,450
That's just nature,
right?

136
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,970
It's the way it is,
the way of the world.

137
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,350
We have the land.
Yeah,

138
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,260
that is right.
And is just,

139
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,290
it's just such a fascinating thing that 
people can just show you a little images

140
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:17,731
there world.
Hey,

141
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:18,564
this is me at the grammy's take way more
interesting than it really is really 

142
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,330
cultivated,
you know,

143
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,540
make it look like they're really in 
vacationing all the time.

144
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,374
And they have the least close and they 
go to the best parties and meet them in 

145
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,810
a live in studio city with four 
roommates in the studio.

146
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,020
Puppet.
Yeah.

147
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,850
We all want everybody to think that 
we're doing better than we are.

148
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:43,470
Right.
Why is that?

149
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,043
What's that about?
Because if people think you're doing 

150
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:48,324
better than it makes you feel better 
because they treat you like you're 

151
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:51,354
doing.
They treat you like you're at the level 

152
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:55,230
that you're fixed fictitiously 
portraying.

153
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,520
Right?
Right.

154
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,470
So,
you know what I mean?

155
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,410
So you get better treatment based on a 
life you don't really live.

156
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,560
Right?
So if you become insta famous,

157
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,383
like what do you get out of that?
You could see you could make a living 

158
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:11,070
off of that.
We'll see comics doing it all the time.

159
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,230
Yeah.
There's a comics or kyle done again.

160
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,273
Dude.
Carl Dunnigan blew up because of those 

161
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,840
little videos that he puts on his.
Do you ever see that?

162
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,140
No.
Fuck you.

163
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:19,974
Hilarious.
Does face swaps with Kim Kardashian and 

164
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:24,600
Donald Trump?
You never seen it?

165
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,420
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

166
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,720
Oh my God.
Please go back to the one where,

167
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,510
uh,
bruce is telling them he's pregnant.

168
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,380
See if you could see if he could find 
that one.

169
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,090
Dude,
he's genius.

170
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:41,180
Really?
He does Solo.

171
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,280
Dude.
It is the funniest page on the Internet.

172
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,990
I'm not bullshitting.
Kyle Dot Higgins.

173
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:48,360
Instagram pages.
The funniest page on the Internet.

174
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:49,440
Okay.
That's saying a lot.

175
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,520
Dude.
I swear to God I,

176
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,080
because I have yet to seen a really.
Well,

177
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,800
I've seen a few,
but then they kind of just fizzled out.

178
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:56,843
I cry.
I showed the one with the Kim 

179
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,240
Kardashians.
The washing machine,

180
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,180
the dishwasher or the,
uh,

181
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,810
the,
the clothes washing machine.

182
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,110
The one where she's lost in the house.
Dude.

183
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,433
Here it goes.

184
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,540
The buildup.
Whereas it,

185
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,520
it can.
I'm a loft in my house.

186
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,570
Oh Shit.
Look at your surroundings.

187
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:24,510
What do you Shay?
There's this white box.

188
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,560
White box.
I don't know.

189
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,170
I put north and died three.
Oh,

190
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,500
you're such a great thing.
All right.

191
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,570
Let me get Connie on the phone.
He said Jane Yesh.

192
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,750
Yeah.
Called Kanye and Kanye again.

193
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,440
You know what?
That white box behind

194
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,310
do.
Deeds don't know my girls.

195
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,360
Space Rock

196
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,033
captured

197
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,140
grandma too.
He'll save you from outside.

198
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,420
Shit,
it's so silly.

199
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,330
He's so silly that he's talking to 
Donald Trump.

200
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,920
No,
he's got a shitload of a man.

201
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,430
You got to go to his page.
I got to follow all of his pain.

202
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,020
There's nothing like a regular person on
his page,

203
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,950
right?
There's nothing like,

204
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:29,620
here's me at the fixtures.
Have Dinner.

205
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
Go look at this sunset.
No,

206
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:35,320
there's none of that shit.
His page is basically like a channel.

207
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,610
Oh Shit.
He's at 300,

208
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:39,010
$4,000.
He deserves it.

209
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,010
He had done a good man.
He deserves it.

210
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:44,770
I'm telling you that this is the 
funniest page on the Internet.

211
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,450
I got to follow it.
Oh my God.

212
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,520
Kills me.
It's such an interesting.

213
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,241
People use it,
right?

214
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:52,300
Some people use instagram correctly,
people it,

215
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,640
but more importantly,
this is like a new thing.

216
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,903
He's able to put his,
like his use his mouth and use other 

217
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,950
people's faces for the first time.

218
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,003
Like when has anybody ever been able to 
do that without some great giant studio 

219
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,690
behind you?
The fact that he can do all this shit on

220
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,890
his phone.
Progressive.

221
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,930
This is a new feature.
You can do it on your phone.

222
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:10,711
You can download that.
No,

223
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:11,640
no.
I know you can do it,

224
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:14,790
but I'm saying that now it opens up this
whole new kind of comedy.

225
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,800
That's a new kind of comedy.
I love it.

226
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,910
We,
I mean,

227
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:21,090
we know he's not those people,
but he's doing those people.

228
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:26,091
It's like a ultra hilarious impressions.
It's his own snl on his phone.

229
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,430
You got to see him do bill Maher,
find the bill Maher one.

230
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,413
His Bill Marwan is fucking genius.
He sounds exactly like Bill Maher and 

231
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:37,830
then he's got bill Maher's face.
Shit is so funny man.

232
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,910
He's so good.
This is just like a new thing.

233
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,560
People.
People get this,

234
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:46,950
uh,
this new opportunity to do shit on.

235
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,113
You know,
the Internet is so interesting in that 

236
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,050
way.
Just as some new thing opens up and some

237
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,620
comics.
Oh look at that.

238
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:55,460
It's my space.
Was that twitter?

239
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,400
Was that?
Yeah.

240
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,510
Facebook was that.
Well,

241
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,850
I had seen people do like little things.
Here it is.

242
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:00,460
Look at this.

243
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,450
Here's,
Oh really?

244
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,843
A cow jumped over the moon.
It took NASA astronauts going 17,000 

245
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:15,070
miles an hour wait to get to the moon,
which is bullshit.

246
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,820
I cow couldn't jump over one of you 
stupid idiots during nap time.

247
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,140
Okay.
Oh,

248
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,090
you're crying now.
I'm on page two.

249
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Buckle up.
Asshole

250
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,380
impression.
Come on man.

251
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:30,120
That impression is fucking genius.
That was great.

252
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,550
That was great.
He's so good.

253
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,480
Dude.
That was great.

254
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,290
And it's the face swap thing makes it 
100 times better.

255
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,870
Like that shit would be funny on its 
own,

256
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,470
but with him doing that face swap to 
follow kyle.

257
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,553
Yeah.
Or you found them right now on live on 

258
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,240
the podcast.
Gentlemen.

259
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,380
He's fallen countdown again.
Kyle did again.

260
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,223
One Tony Rock.
You are one of the comics in this world 

261
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:57,710
that does not get the credit that you 
deserve.

262
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,660
One of those guys.
Thank you.

263
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:00,494
And I agree.
I think you're one of the funniest guys 

264
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,350
alive.
You and I agree.

265
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,663
I watched you do a set.
I guess it was last month when we did 

266
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,950
Tripoli's a show with the store,
right?

267
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,240
That's how long ago was that?
About two months maybe.

268
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,070
Something like that.
Yeah,

269
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,620
Dude.

270
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,360
Fuck that.
You're funny as fuck.

271
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,070
It's,
it's fun to watch.

272
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,440
You got a lot of energy to man.
You powerful.

273
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,030
Thank you brother.
That was a.

274
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,310
That was a thing.
Like a couple guys after your set.

275
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,630
Willard.
Whew.

276
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,100
That was some heavy hitters on that one.
That night.

277
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:29,960
It was a.
That was a fun show.

278
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,840
I forgot who it was.
Billy on that Mobile Bill Barnett with.

279
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,910

281
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,450

So every time I see trip I'm like,

282
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:41,820

283
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,680

We did new faces together.

284
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,950
Wow.
New faces.

285
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,990
Did I remember those days?
Yeah.

286
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,540
Meet the needs of hope me trip.

Oh Shit.

288
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,013

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,030
We show.
He speaks very highly of corey holcomb.

291
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,830
Super Funny.
Joey.

292
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,733
Joey Diaz.
I will always love because Joey Diaz 

293
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,713
shot the movie,
a longest yard with my brother and he 

294
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:12,820
says he sees me at the comedy.
So.

295
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:13,840
Hey man,

296
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:16,540
you know I don't waste no time.
I see your brother day one.

297
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,160
I'm like,
why the fuck is your brother not in this

298
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:20,590
movie?
He can throw a football.

299
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:24,430
You can run faster than you guys.
I love you forever,

300
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:25,870
man.
I fucking love you.

301
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,500
This is bullshit.
He does not play games.

302
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:32,050
There will be no injustices around bad 
guy.

303
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,200
Go eat a sandwich.
Shit,

304
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,710
whatever.
I'm around them.

305
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,260
Sometimes we get too high and I just 
don't want to get them mad about it.

306
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,570
You never know what to say what not to 
say.

307
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,590
You could mention the wrong band or the 
wrong food or the clothes.

308
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,440
He's gone and you're just getting a big 
town to switch.

309
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,273
He just explodes.
You gotta know days when he's actually 

310
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:53,050
dangerous.
You gotta catch them after Jujitsu.

311
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,370
Joey,
Joey Diaz.

312
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,720
Wow.
All the time,

313
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:56,501
man.
Really?

314
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,334
Yeah.
He's lost a ton of weight to Joey's 

315
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,073
down.
I think I got to say more than 50 

316
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:02,270
pounds.
Oh,

317
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:03,940
I haven't seen him in a while.
I kinda.

318
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,650
I want to know.
I want to know how much he's lost.

319
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,070
He's lost quite a bit of weight and he's
going to just on a regular basis.

320
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,090
Yeah,
he gets into it.

321
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:11,660
He still,
he's doing more time now too,

322
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:14,000
is doing kickboxing classes.
Joey Diaz,

323
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,260
kickboxing.
Joey Diaz gets down and I didn't want to

324
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:20,710
make it seem like it was so shocking 
when joy to everybody we know.

325
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,660
You know,
he used to be a lot bigger man,

326
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,060
but he's a,
he's become much more disciplined,

327
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,150
you know,
he's really a discipline.

328
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,430
Is Diet and women a woman in his life 
health scare?

329
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,511
No,
he had a kid,

330
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,344
he had a kid a few years back and that 
started the shift and then he's just 

331
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,560
been.
He's also just been more aware,

332
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:39,730
you know,
as you get older,

333
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:40,564
like you really do have to take care of 
your body or it's going to fail and it 

334
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,260
might fail.
Even if you take care of it,

335
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,020
you know,
it's just like you're hedging your bets.

336
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,790
You're making it stronger.
True.

337
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:49,963
You know,
it's just,

338
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,040
you gotta,
you gotTa watch all the,

339
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,780
all the warning signs,
you know,

340
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,620
obviously a lot of excess weight is a 
giant comics.

341
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,454
It's like we just don't sleep and 
there's a lot of drinking late nights 

342
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:06,160
and there's the travel,
the distresses dude,

343
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,053
as you get older too,
that don't sleep and shit just does not 

344
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:10,870
fly.
Your body's like,

345
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,300
fuck you man.
We'll get sand bodies.

346
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:14,140
Like,
I'm going to sleep.

347
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:15,450
You can do what pitch.

348
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,943
I will give you a cold.
I will give you a cold and then you'll 

349
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,320
have to lie down.
You can fuck.

350
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,380
I'll give you a fucking the three day 
migraine.

351
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,270
It's a weird thing,
right?

352
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,104
That balance that you have to have,
like the moment someone figures out 

353
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:30,970
something that you could do where you 
don't ever need sleep.

354
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,520
We're going to have a weird world just 
coming.

355
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,210
It's coming.
You think some kind of pill or something

356
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,950
will come in and probably right.
I mean,

357
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:41,880
if they have pills that make you,
uh,

358
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,920
make you go to sleep,
why wouldn't have pills?

359
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,090
They just figure out,
oh,

360
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:46,924
well this just counteracts all the 
biochemical responses that your brain 

361
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:50,050
creates,
what it needs.

362
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:53,510
Sleep your brain into thinking you're,
you're actively,

363
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:54,344
you know,
in the meantime we've actually found 

364
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,370
through independent studies is that it 
improves your recovery.

365
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,443
You actually live better with Chris Ryan
just posted some shit yesterday that I 

366
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:04,604
read,
tweeted about how they were doctors and 

367
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:08,684
scientists were encouraging women to 
breastfeed and they were going to do it 

368
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:12,284
nationally,
but it got sideswiped by the formula 

369
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:15,764
industry.

370
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,670
Is that disturbing shit?
That's.

371
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,773
I believe that 100 percent because 
there's always the other side where 

372
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,790
we're going to not make money if this 
thing gets through that,

373
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,110
but that one right there.
That is terrible.

374
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,460
That's a terrible idea.
It is.

375
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,330
That's your,
your.

376
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,290
You're deciding to give babies less 
nutrition.

377
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,400
You're making a decision for profit,
profit over baby's nutrition.

378
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,590
You'll lying to moms.
It's like big tobacco was big tobacco's.

379
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,200
You know,
backhoe isn't targeting babies.

380
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:52,430
I know and I know there's no,
like there's no supporting big tobacco.

381
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:53,820
These,
you know,

382
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,580
how many people have died from fucking 
cigarettes,

383
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,250
right?
Imagine if that was from something else.

384
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,830
So many of the product like diet coke,
we have diet coke,

385
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:04,430
just killing people left.
Do you think it is?

386
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,440
Of course.
I'm not sure about that.

387
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,560
I'm not sure it was not killing people 
like cigarettes,

388
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:10,394
but I think it's not good for you,
but as far as anybody ever get like 

389
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,570
cigarette it out.

390
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,653
Nobody's doing commercials with the 
thing and the next day and I drink too 

391
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,460
much diet coke,
but.

392
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,573
But if you,
I guess if you drink and all the 

393
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,620
chemicals in it and all the different 
things and all that.

394
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:25,520
Caffeine,
if you drank them,

395
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:27,250
nothing but diet cokes all day,
like 15,

396
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,540
$20.
Then you see it was a v,

397
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,160
like a youtube video where they put 
stuff in Coca Cola,

398
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:34,610
left for days and how it dissolves,
it destroys.

399
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:38,300
It felt like a brick and a coca cola and
it just dissolves.

400
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:43,190
The brick blocks just crashed.
I used to.

401
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,770
But if you're eating a mountain dew,
like it was no fat,

402
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:50,660
juicy cheeseburger and a Dr Pepper or 
cold Dr. pepper on ice.

403
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,510
Oh my goodness.
It tastes so good.

404
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,370
Why?
Why is it the things that tastes good?

405
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,640
So most things that are bad for you.
Yeah,

406
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,200
most things.
That's the.

407
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,720
But that's like so many things and 
that's how they get you.

408
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,490
That's how they get how to get you.
That's how life gets.

409
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,330
Snickers is delicious.
Yeah.

410
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,353
Way Too much sugar.
How much will you indulge that part of 

411
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,654
your brain?
How much will you let that part of your 

412
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,480
brain run your life?
That's the thing.

413
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,920
You have to control that part of your 
brain.

414
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,730
Self-Discipline.
Yeah.

415
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,700
Yeah.
But God damn man,

416
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:21,230
if you're in front of an ice cream 
Sundae,

417
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,680
you're just looking at that thing.
Self discipline.

418
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:29,900
But goddamn the hardest thing in the 
world.

419
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:31,610
If it's in front of me,
eight times out of 10,

420
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:32,444
I just go,
fuck it.

421
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,023
I just do good.
Most of the time we talking food or bad 

422
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:37,730
stuff in general.
Mostly.

423
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,100
Mostly it's good for you.
Delicious food.

424
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:40,934
Like if I'm.
If I'm holding strong on my diet and 

425
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,170
somebody pushing some Lasagna in front 
of me and I'm like,

426
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,033
oh my God,
I tried to do the no dairy until I try 

427
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:50,070
to do no dairy until I get off a plane 
in New York City and I'm like,

428
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,903
there's no way.
I'm not having a whole pizza right from 

429
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:55,960
Fulton street deed count pizzas,
dairy,

430
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,910
because of the doe.
Yeah.

431
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:58,260
Oh Jeez.
Right.

432
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,160
Yeah,
that's right.

433
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,330
Cheese.
Yeah.

434
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,070
Dairy's a weird one of the people,
right?

435
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,570
Yeah.
They say that you,

436
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:04,404
uh,
if you eat that raw cheese that your 

437
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:08,220
body has a much easier time digesting 
it.

438
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,810
Raw Cheese.
Yeah.

439
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,520
Man.
They have raw milk cheese.

440
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,420
That cheese is made with raw milk as 
opposed to cheese.

441
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:16,890
It's made with homogenized and 
pasteurized milk.

442
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,150
I had this friend who was a surgeon from
France,

443
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,403
really smart guy,
and he was explaining this to me once 

444
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,104
and he had to smuggle cheese over from 
Europe to America and they were 

445
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:29,230
terrified they were going to get caught 
in the,

446
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,550
as a cancer surgeon because the cheese 
is just because it's.

447
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,333
Yeah.
Because it's illegal to have because 

448
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,210
they want you to have the bad stuff 
here.

449
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,100
Well,
they want it to be safe.

450
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,810
See,
there's no bad guy here.

451
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:42,840
It's kind of like a double bad guy 
because what,

452
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,823
you know,
what they're trying to do is prevent 

453
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:46,320
diseases.
They want milk to be able to stay on the

454
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:50,760
shelf because like all of our surplus 
and all this stuff that we have in terms

455
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,350
of like green and food and stuff like 
that,

456
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,410
like if we didn't have it and something 
went wrong,

457
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,290
it would be kind of sketchy and that's 
what happened somewhere around world war

458
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,193
two.
That's why we created all this stuff in 

459
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:00,684
the first place.
That's where things started getting 

460
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,890
really weird in terms of stacking things
up and surpluses and.

461
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,060
But milk can't stay raw on a shelf.
Very long man.

462
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,850
He would lose so much money because 
things get transported and if it's milk,

463
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:15,810
it's got to be local.

464
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,120
It's got to be pretty fresh,
but damn,

465
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:21,450
if she can get it,
if you can get it from like a real good,

466
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,590
like a whole foods market or one of 
those sprouts sometimes has raw milk.

467
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,850
It tastes better.
Well,

468
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:30,600
whole foods now has stuff that's like 
just as normal as Ralph's.

469
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,501
Yeah.
Yeah.

470
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:34,380
It's like wholefoods.
The Myth is has been,

471
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,243
you know,
exposed well it's also the other places 

472
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,293
like Ralphs and vons,
they're becoming more like diverse with 

473
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:43,280
their food choices.
Right?

474
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,123
They're trying to compete and hopefully 
they'll put in grass fed meat in there 

475
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,330
and stuff like that.
And organic vegetables.

476
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,193
Yeah,
they're all because that's the other 

477
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,280
ones.
What does it all?

478
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:54,270
So it's like weird granola and so you 
know what I mean?

479
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:56,700
Those is like a weird granola aisle.
Like who's buying this shit?

480
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,200
Weird Chenwa section.
This is an empty section man.

481
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,830
Tumbleweeds tried off with the first 
time was good a couple of months ago.

482
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,910
It's a very good grain.
I tried Kale for first time,

483
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,760
but you never had kale.
Dude.

484
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,770
Trying to eat healthy.
I'll make you a kale shake.

485
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,260
You'll freak out.
It feels like you're on drugs.

486
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,340
Really?
Oh Man.

487
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,920
It just gets you so fired up so much 
nutrients.

488
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:23,160
Just get jolted into your system.
We got to try this.

489
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,523
Use Kale,
a giant thumb sized chunk of ginger for 

490
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,030
garlic,
cloves,

491
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,810
a pair and celery.
Yes.

492
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,550
And run through the wall.
Like dude,

493
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:40,710
when you're drinking this stuff,
your whole body's going,

494
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:45,210
why in the fuck is all this?
Because it's blended down.

495
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,980
You don't even have to chew it to absorb
it.

496
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:47,980
This is going

497
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,920
right in there and getting broken down.
You feel great,

498
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,120
but then you better be close to a 
bathroom,

499
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:59,121
so it's not to say that I feel great,
but it's cleaning you out quickly.

500
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,233
Like a fucking tsunami siren.
It's coming at your butthole door when 

501
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,070
it.
When it goes.

502
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:07,240
Especially if you put.
Oh,

503
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:11,110
that's the other thing I forgot to add.
You need either coconut oil or mct oil.

504
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,980
What's MCT?
Medium chain triglyceride oil.

505
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:15,814
It's essentially an aspect of coconut 
oil that they extract and it's just a 

506
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,364
really strong healthy oil and a lot of 
people put it in coffee and stuff and 

507
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,990
different,
different things,

508
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:28,090
but it's a.
it's a good dietary aid,

509
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,043
but you have to put it in there because 
apparently at least as it's been 

510
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,424
explained to me,
the nutrients absorb in the body better 

511
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:40,411
if there's fat mixed in with them so 
that healthy mct oil or coconut oil.

512
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,853
When you put all that stuff in there,
then it allows your body to process 

513
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:45,430
those nutrients better,
but dude,

514
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,460
you better be clear like a sprint or was
this the cleansing shake?

515
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,660
It just tastes good.
The key,

516
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,630
the key is don't put too much mct oil.
That's the key.

517
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,613
That seems to be the difference between 
make it into the bathroom and having a 

518
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,640
dreadful result and calling for help 
from Laurel Canyon.

519
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,520
He might have to call for help.
Do you eat healthy?

520
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,040
I try.
I try.

521
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:08,874
You know,
I have the Vegan friends and I have 

522
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,960
friends that like to cook and eat and 
foodies,

523
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,510
so I'm trying to walk the fine line.
You know,

524
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,810
it's hard when you're on the road,
right?

525
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,400
It is very hard to eat healthy on the 
road.

526
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,140
I try to do.
I go to whole foods,

527
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:24,580
I'll try to get some soup and some chips
or whatever for the room,

528
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:27,320
but I had to attend tonight.

529
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,920
It shows up at midnight,
you know,

530
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,983
hanging around and take pictures with 
people and now it's 1:00 and I'm 

531
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,480
starving and there's nothing open.
Then I can get a healthy meal from.

532
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,820
Yeah.
I always bring protein bars everywhere.

533
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:42,130
I go out to him to bring almonds and 
protein bars.

534
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,200
Those are two good things to bring.
I should start doing it.

535
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,730
Yeah.
It's like it's an easy thing,

536
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:46,564
like if you just use it,
just trying to get some nutrition just 

537
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,920
just to fill your stomach.
You're hungry.

538
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,870
Just let me just so I'm not hungry 
anymore.

539
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,860
Almonds are great because.
Just a couple of elements.

540
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,703
I can't.
I can't do the homework.

541
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,970
Well,
don't listen to you that I'm allergic to

542
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,900
almonds.
Fucked.

543
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,520
How'd you get allergic to almonds?
I don't know.

544
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,710
I'm allergic to almonds.
Pecans.

545
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:03,544
I believe walnuts,
but not peanuts because peanuts is not 

546
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,060
really.

547
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,580
Peanut grows in the ground.
Almonds,

548
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:10,590
pecans.
Grow on trees.

549
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,930
So something like something weird.
There were whoa.

550
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,740
Peanuts grow in the ground.
I did not know that.

551
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,370
Did you know that a peanut is not?
Jamie didn't know it either.

552
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,483
Peanuts.
All Day.

553
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,410
All my life.
I've never thought about a peanut tree.

554
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,180
Like what the fuck's a peanut tree?
Looked like?

555
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:28,000
I've never thought about that one.
Even though Jimmy Carter,

556
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,010
I remember it was a peanut farmer in 
Georgia.

557
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,840
That was like a big thing.
That was his brother.

558
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:32,980
Wasn't that his brother?
No,

559
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:34,300
he was a peanut farmer.
Oh,

560
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,970
Jimmy Carter was.
He was his family.

561
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:39,130
He was peanuts all day.
Yeah man.

562
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,690
But I never knew what a fucking peanut 
looked like,

563
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,960
like in the ground.
I thought it was a tree.

564
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,910
No,
but I never even saw like I could see an

565
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:48,320
art.
If you said a picture,

566
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:49,100
an orange tree.

567
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,830
I could see it.
Picture a peanut tree.

568
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:52,730
What?
What the fuck?

569
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,930
How does that thing look like?
Meanwhile,

570
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,180
I've had way more peanuts that I've had 
oranges free full of squirrels will look

571
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,020
like.
Right.

572
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,570
You always picture it scrolls with 
peanuts.

573
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,340
So you look,
that's what it looks like.

574
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,480
So they pulled that out of the ground.
Yeah.

575
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,350
Whoa.
So that's Kinda.

576
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,960
It kinda grows like that on top of the 
grant right there.

577
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:13,220
Yeah.
Wow.

578
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,050
It grows on top of the ground.
Pick them.

579
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:15,923
Yeah.
You Go.

580
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,953
I remember picking them with my 
grandmother back in South Carolina back 

581
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:20,990
in the day.
It really is a trip like that.

582
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:21,824
Some food,
some of these plants are incredibly 

583
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:25,364
nutritious to your body and some of 
these plants will kill the fuck out of 

584
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:31,850
you instantly and nature made people 
figure it out.

585
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,250
He had to figure it out by trial and 
error.

586
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,570
Trial and error.
You imagine what it was like.

587
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,750
Blowfish.
That guy.

588
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:38,380
The first guy.
Hey,

589
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:40,100
it's the fish.
We can we eat fish.

590
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,160
Bang.
Gone ahead.

591
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,733
Yeah.
How about those assholes is still 

592
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,370
decided to make Sushi out of it.
If you.

593
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,230
If you cut it an inch to the left is the
right.

594
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:48,821
You're dead.
Like,

595
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,080
why?
Why not just not eating.

596
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:50,711
No,
no,

597
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:51,071
no,
no,

598
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:53,300
no.
Like why not just skip that one?

599
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,640
Danger that that probably doesn't make 
it taste better.

600
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,830
He got those chopsticks and you're 
bringing it up to your lips.

601
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:58,900
You don't like this guy.
Fuck,

602
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,990
this guy's getting old.
Maybe it's visions going bad.

603
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,800
His want to say anything because he 
wants to keep his job.

604
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:04,730
I don't know this fucking guy.

605
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,240
And wait.
Yeah,

606
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,830
like blowfish,
Sushi.

607
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,130
That's like the.
The wing suit of Sushi.

608
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,460
You know those crazy people that jumped 
my friend Andy Stumpf,

609
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,473
they jump off cliffs wing suits.
That's what that is for Sushi eaters I 

610
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,610
saw was it was a guy that went through a
a whole.

611
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,571
Yeah.
Yeah.

612
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,010
I saw that.
It was like if he misses,

613
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,690
he's,
he's dead instantly.

614
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:34,490
Dead death.
There's a lot of videos.

615
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,324
Those guys dying.
There was a video of a guy hitting a 

616
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:40,730
bridge going like 100 plus miles an 
hour.

617
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:43,010
Hit this bridge.
It was awful.

618
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,550
I mean fuck line.
Yeah.

619
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,530
Bungee jumping on said,
you know,

620
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:51,890
we'll split this bungee jumping,
but did you see this video will smith?

621
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,460
He,
he,

622
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,900
he,
he posted a video on his instagram.

623
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,763
Who under the guy that has a great 
instagram posted a video about how fear 

624
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,520
I know amazing things or right on the 
other side of fear.

625
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,040
Yeah,
so he's been doing this thing where he's

626
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:07,130
just conquering all those fears and he's
has a group of guys that,

627
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,110
that professional bungee jump was that 
bungee jumping on his birthday,

628
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:16,190
his 50th birthday out of a helicopter 
over the Grand Canyon.

629
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,860
Jesus,
this I got to see.

630
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,473
That seems like a terrible idea.
We did a bunch of that kind of shit on 

631
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:28,430
fear factor,
man.

632
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,733
We did it in the last season.
The last season we did a couple of them 

633
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,233
that really had me freaked out,
but one of them they hook people up to 

634
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:38,954
these bungee cords and they were had him
tied to like a post or something or a 

635
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,980
tree or something.
I forget what it was.

636
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,813
They were shackled thing.
It was a post and the person had to 

637
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:48,204
release them,
like figuring out which key goes into 

638
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:54,870
which lock and it was like a race to do 
it and as soon as you released they shot

639
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,733
through the air because there was a 
helicopter holding onto a bungee cord 

640
00:26:58,081 --> 00:26:59,490
behind them.
Wow.

641
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,710
And then they were just dangling over 
this canyon,

642
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:04,860
like bouncing up and down and I watched 
the first one,

643
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:08,100
like they did a test one and I watched 
and I was like,

644
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,190
yeah,
they know what they're doing.

645
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,173
I guess they know what they're doing.
These guys are like professional stunt 

646
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:14,730
guys.
But I was like,

647
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,893
I would not want to be that person 
attached to that Bungee cord was the 

648
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:20,880
person that came up with these things.
Like I would watch the show.

649
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,560
I didn't mind the dangerous stuff like 
that.

650
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,200
Just the eating like every time I'm 
like,

651
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,270
how did you know you could eat that?
Yeah.

652
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,130
They had a whole team that,
you know,

653
00:27:28,131 --> 00:27:28,964
that won't kill you.
They know they would do toxicology 

654
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:34,620
examinations on certain bugs,
had grind them up and find out what,

655
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,370
you know,
what,

656
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,990
what's bad for you,
what's not,

657
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,920
who's that guy?
A lot of those people that ate food,

658
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:44,220
men that they shouldn't have had to eat.
Like they would do it with interns,

659
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,440
poor interns,
nice kids too.

660
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,080
Scarred for life.
Well,

661
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,023
there were,
there were working on production or 

662
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:51,834
they're not interested or I'm sorry,
they were pas production assistance and 

663
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,823
they would have to uh,
do like these really fucking difficult 

664
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,830
eating challenges.
If they did it,

665
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:03,870
they'd want a certain amount of money.
They'd get a certain amount of money.

666
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:06,600
I would always give them whatever I had 
in my pocket too.

667
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,810
They won't eat anything other than a 
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

668
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,750
Oh,
this poor kids like the.

669
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,123
Yeah.
I was just.

670
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,963
Some of it was ridiculous.
So there's some things you just can't 

671
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,660
eat.
Just can't chew it down enough.

672
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,880
Right?
Like smell.

673
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,120
You'd be like,
yeah,

674
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,430
it's coming up.
Yeah,

675
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:24,264
but that didn't scare me.
What scares me is like the bungee cords 

676
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:28,800
under the helicopters type shit.
That was like,

677
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,990
how do you know that that's gonna work 
out.

678
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:31,770
Right?
Every time.

679
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,603
I don't know.
I would take a Bungee cord over the 

680
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,173
helicopter,
the helicopter before bull nuts and all 

681
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:38,334
that stuff.
No,

682
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,440
really to nuts or just just meat.
I just eat it.

683
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,860
That's one of the easiest ones.
Bull nuts would be super easy.

684
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,580
People love those things.
They call them rocky mountain oysters.

685
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,040
I've heard that.
I've seen it.

686
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,273
One of those cooking shows and they fry 
them hollering like a fried pork rinds 

687
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,633
and when.

688
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,130
Oh,
is that what you do with them?

689
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,910
It looks like pork.
Yeah.

690
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:03,960
They slice it and fry it up hard.
Oh Wow.

691
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,573
I hadn't seen that.
I'd seen a sauteed and I'd see that 

692
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:08,574
where they breaded them,
they like a breaded bulled nut bread 

693
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:13,470
them and fry them.
Yeah.

694
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:16,810
It's apparently people love them.
They are.

695
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,740
They chop those up.
Rocky Mountain Oysters.

696
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:21,450
Fried cauliflower.
Yeah.

697
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,620
Man's dominion tells you that's 
cauliflower.

698
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:27,540
You eat it or they say it's cauliflower,
you eat it,

699
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,410
and then your friend is like,
no,

700
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:29,580
I'm kidding.
It was bold nuts.

701
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,890
See,
really bothers you that it's bull nuts.

702
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,620
Yeah,
Kinda doesn't bother me at all.

703
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,993
I think in,
if you're going to eat the whole animal 

704
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:40,230
and you might as well use balls to just 
out of respect.

705
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,210
I mean

706
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,043
the,
you know,

707
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,313
the whole thing about castrating them as
strange too and they only cast rate and 

708
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:51,640
because they want them to be a.
that's how you get a steer,

709
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,160
right?
Like when they make a steak,

710
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,020
right?
You get it out of a steer.

711
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,620
That means it doesn't breed.
Took a bolded.

712
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,570
They snipped right.
That's kind of crazy.

713
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,740
That's kind of crazy sad.
It's just how they did it for the bull.

714
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,920
Sad life.
Unfortunate.

715
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,610
So like did they,
they must do that with grass fed beef to

716
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,090
right?
Probably.

717
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,933
Yeah.
So what's the one they put in the world 

718
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,090
is veal,
right?

719
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:20,890
They put the.
Oh that's in the box.

720
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,280
Oh yeah.
If that doesn't bother you,

721
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,050
what kind of person?
You know,

722
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,320
what are you doing?
Tip of the cap.

723
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,283
Is that what it is?
They put the half in a box so he can't 

724
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:32,920
grow.

725
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,600
Yeah.
And they keep them in the dark and keeps

726
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,583
that,
keeps the meat tender or something like 

727
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,783
that.
Who's the person that came up with that 

728
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:42,000
one?
That guy was an ass guy,

729
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,190
was an asshole.
It was.

730
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,650
Put it in a dark box and for years it 
didn't meet.

731
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,830
Will be.
Yeah.

732
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,920
Well here's the thing that I've found 
from eating wild meat specifically,

733
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,950
and I know that everybody can't eat wild
meat.

734
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,140
I'm very aware of that argument,
but that none of those animals,

735
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:57,880
I like that they're,
they're living,

736
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,820
they're living this buck wild nature 
life.

737
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,713
They're out there in the woods with 
predators and their survival for years 

738
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:07,444
in the mountains.
There's mountain lions out there and 

739
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,860
bears out there.
And these fucking things and figured out

740
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:15,820
a way to get away from them and survive.
There are wired and alive.

741
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,103
And if you eat one of those,
it's just a different thing than eaten 

742
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:20,710
these prisoners.

743
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,020
You know,
we're eating prisoners.

744
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,070
That's,
that seems bad to be out in the wild,

745
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:28,900
living your life.
You're an elk or a.

746
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,850
and then a human walks into this forum 
that doesn't belong.

747
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,280
He's the outsider and blows your fucking
head off.

748
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,440
True.
Unless you like to eat elk,

749
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,333
then it's awesome.
That's exactly what you were looking 

750
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,270
for.
You know?

751
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,720
I mean we could decide all day like 
who's land is whose land?

752
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,630
It's their land.
This is where the elk club,

753
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:49,464
this is their home.
They will walk right through your 

754
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:53,170
fucking living room and stump your kid 
to death.

755
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:54,850
Okay?
Don't get it twisted.

756
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,130
I don't think it was coming to my living
room.

757
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,000
But if they wanted to,
like they're,

758
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,870
they're not respecting our,
our property because they love us.

759
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:04,000
And you know,
we have a mutual agreement.

760
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,010
No they,
they're not really dangerous.

761
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:08,170
But Moose,
our Moose will fuck you up.

762
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,220
I've never seen.
I've heard,

763
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,430
I've heard mostly like gigantic.
If you find a moose in your backyard,

764
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:16,060
get the fuck back in your house because 
the Moose might fuck you.

765
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,290
Really?
Oh yeah.

766
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,600
Especially if you come near a Mama.
It's a mama and her calves.

767
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,960
I've never seen them.
Little slap the fuck live.

768
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,340
They're so big.
Dude.

769
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:29,050
Didn't even look real.
When you see them,

770
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:31,360
they're so big.
They're so big.

771
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,830
They're like 20 deer.
Damn.

772
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,210
Really moves.
Like what?

773
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,290
North America?
Canada?

774
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,280
Yeah.
Like I'm probably

775
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,300
north the loose in Carolina.
In this Moose in Colorado.

776
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,253
There's Moose in Canada.
There's a lot of moose in certain parts 

777
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,460
of Canada.
Oh yeah,

778
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:50,870
yeah.
There's a moose in Alaska.

779
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,470
Oh yeah.
Moose.

780
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,480
Moose is delicious,
but they're so big.

781
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:55,100
You can't believe how big they are when 
you see them.

782
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,230
You've eaten multiples.
Yeah.

783
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,180
Ain't moves before.
Wow.

784
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,153
Yeah,
it's really good.

785
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,160
It's delicious.
You get a lot of stuff in.

786
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,780
Yeah,
but it's.

787
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,950
I just,
I don't know,

788
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,060
I like it.
It's better for you.

789
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:07,870
But the whole point was this whole thing
like,

790
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,200
you know,
I don't want that.

791
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,800
Like that is not like,
that's not.

792
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,143
You don't have to eat that,
like why do you even want it that 

793
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:16,880
tender?
Like what are you doing?

794
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,520
Because he does it hurt when you chew.
Fuck you doing.

795
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,890
I don't get it,
man.

796
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,103
You scared of children.
I just want good tasting foods to be 

797
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,590
softer in that.

798
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,261
Where it's like,
oh,

799
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:29,870
it's so tender.
We're so lazy.

800
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,490
We don't even want to work out when we 
eat.

801
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,910
We'll go through it.
You Lazy Ass.

802
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,220
Get it off the bone.
Just chew it.

803
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,410
You fuck.
No,

804
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,253
Nah.
I'd rather keep this little baby cow 

805
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:48,020
hostage.
All Hog tied to is horrible.

806
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,093
It is horrible.
That's one of the more horrible things 

807
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:51,620
about farming,
right?

808
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,750
They,
I guess they have free range veal too,

809
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,830
which is basically just free range is 
still on in prison,

810
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,780
in autofarm.
Free range chickens.

811
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:00,770
Like they,
they still.

812
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,710
They know what they see.
They don't want a farm.

813
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,573
That's true.
But free range chickens are the 

814
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:07,940
exception because freeway and chickens,
they don't get anywhere.

815
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,530
If you have a chicken house,
okay.

816
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:10,364
And you have a yard.
You don't ever have to fence the 

817
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:12,584
chickens in.
The only reason why you fence the 

818
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,410
chickens in is protecting them from 
other things.

819
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,090
They go right in there.
Chicken house at night,

820
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,800
like we leave the door,
I have chickens,

821
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,510
we have the door open.
At the end of the day,

822
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:23,870
they just go into their little chicken 
coop and climb up into their seats.

823
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,570
They know what do like that.
That's their house.

824
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,433
They lived there like I they.
They have some weird relationship with 

825
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:30,890
me.
They know I bring food,

826
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,710
so when I come around they get excited 
and they follow me around,

827
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,993
but they may know where they live.
They're not prisoners like they want to 

828
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:39,170
be there.
You have free range chicken?

829
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,033
Yeah,
they're free range in the sense that I 

830
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:43,520
let them out all the time,
but the thing about it as data,

831
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,780
they're not going to go to another state
with chicken.

832
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:50,430
Chickens hang around where they're going
to be fedex.

833
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,660
They're wild animals.
They know they a yard.

834
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:54,530
We get fed here.

835
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,363
We.
This guy comes out and throws green on 

836
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:58,700
the ground twice a day,
so we are going to stay here.

837
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,570
Well,
it's not even that.

838
00:34:59,571 --> 00:35:02,000
When you let them out,
they go looking for bugs.

839
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,980
That's all they're doing.
They wander around the yard.

840
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:06,380
They fuck every bug up.
Every bugs dead,

841
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,530
every mouse debt,
anything.

842
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,550
Oh,
they eat the fuck out of mice.

843
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,740
Chickens eat mice.
Jamie,

844
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,400
I think we need to play off played clip 
for Mr. Rock.

845
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,503
Yeah.
Dude.

846
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,270
These I didn't know either until I got 
them.

847
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,410
They eat mice.
The mice down in a ferocious manner.

848
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,010
To the point where cats please pull it 
up.

849
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,630
Here's a fantastic video of a cat 
playing with a mouse.

850
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,140
And a chicken comes over and shows them 
how the fuck it's done.

851
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,230
So here's one where they're going to put
a mouse in this chicken's gonna.

852
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:38,490
Grab it from this.
That's not as impressive.

853
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,470
Jamie,
give me the one where the um,

854
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,050
the.
Give me the one with the cat.

855
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,480
The chicken steals the mouse from the 
cat says chicken.

856
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,950
Eat mice.
Do they eat?

857
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:53,060
People have had these questions.
Uh,

858
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,000
we,
uh,

859
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,000
we had a mouse get into the chicken coop
once,

860
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,320
just to,
just randomly.

861
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,370
This is it.
Watch this.

862
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,680
Look at this chicken.
Or look at this cat.

863
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,020
Cat's thinking about getting the mouse.
So chickens like,

864
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:04,854
bitch,
give me that.

865
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,993
Look at this.

866
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,070
Did you fucking know?
Ferocious Dude.

867
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,860
Just consuming it.
See cats killed.

868
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:16,280
The cat didn't even try to get it in.
The cat was like this guy.

869
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,363
He's taking his time.
Was having to try to get it from the 

870
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,830
chicken.
Chicken.

871
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,340
No,
chickens are too crazy.

872
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,450
Wow.
Okay.

873
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,160
Learn something new everyday.
Chicken eat chicken.

874
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:28,890
Eat Nice wild little fuckers.
So they uh,

875
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,230
they just go around my yard,
Jack and everything that moves.

876
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,210
How many chickens you got?
Thirteen days.

877
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,210
I lost a roost of them.
Lost a bunch of them to coyotes.

878
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

879
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,401
Uh,
no.

880
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:39,540
Rooster.
Rooster.

881
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,350
That's as an asshole move.
Why?

882
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,533
Every movers?

883
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,641
Yeah.
Yeah.

884
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:45,400
Yeah.
I was in Tampa.

885
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,030
You've done a Tampa Improv.
You see chickens all around Ebola?

886
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,730
Yeah.
Chickens.

887
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,540
Five in the morning.
What the fuck man?

888
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,500
I used to have a gardener that uh,
had he kept roosters,

889
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,540
like fighting roosters and when I went 
over his house for something and uh,

890
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:07,630
he lived in Super Mexican neighborhood 
or like everything was in Spanish.

891
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:09,550
All the signs are in Spanish.
Every that I was like,

892
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:10,720
wow.
I mean,

893
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:13,990
is it like almost like visiting a super,
Super Mexican?

894
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:16,270
Nothing was in English.
Everything was in Spanish,

895
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,910
but it was just Super Mexican,
right?

896
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Where everybody in his little area had 
boxes of chicken coops in the backyard.

897
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,470
Just stack fighting,
fighting chickens.

898
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,483
Dude.
I mean like five houses on this one 

899
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:30,843
block.

900
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,860
That's a cultural thing,
right?

901
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,703
Fighting chickens.
So like people fight dogs and then 

902
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,290
everybody's.
What the fuck is it?

903
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,490
A cultural thing.
Also a disclaimer.

904
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:43,260
I don't fight dogs.
I don't even own the dog.

905
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:43,810
I get it.

906
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:48,050
We make a distinction between chickens 
and dogs because we eat chickens because

907
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,250
we eat chickens and because you never 
really form a bond with a chicken.

908
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,420
Like chickens are always.
They never really there for you.

909
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,111
Right.
You know,

910
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:58,690
like my dogs there for me,
I come home,

911
00:37:58,691 --> 00:37:59,830
I'm like,
my man,

912
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:00,910
he gets happy.
I go,

913
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,310
what are you doing?
How are you sir?

914
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,700
He gets,
gives me kisses.

915
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,440
Both of those bags.
As a family member.

916
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,700
Yeah.
Chicken is a meal.

917
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,321
Yeah.
And he,

918
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:09,040
he listens to me.
He's,

919
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,200
he's,
he's uh,

920
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,460
he's,
he's patient,

921
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,400
he's,
you're smart,

922
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,840
smart.
You can't train shit with a chicken.

923
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,510
You could teach them where the food is.
That's it.

924
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,383
No,
you just make the noise and they know 

925
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,250
when they hear that when you get sued 
assistant,

926
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,103
whatever you say it is.

927
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,013
We have a box of dried worms and we 
shake this box of dried meal worms and 

928
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:31,680
they come right here that they come 
running and they love those things.

929
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:32,903
The little fish,
when you put your hand over it just of 

930
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,283
dropped.

931
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,260
You can drop some food on him.
Yeah.

932
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah.
You can train them that much.

933
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,800
But.
So we make a distinction.

934
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:44,350
So when someone's like forest and dogs 
to kill each other,

935
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,903
that's like forcing like a family member
that's making two friends fight to the 

936
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:49,961
death.
Yeah.

937
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,670
Like if you have a family member who 
can't read,

938
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,290
he trick them into fighting to the 
death.

939
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,380
Tell them you love them the most.
If he does it,

940
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,390
hey dude,
if you fight it,

941
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,530
I would love you the most that you have 
to win.

942
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,383
For me,
he's just smart for like a plant smart 

943
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,460
for like,
you know,

944
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,200
like a but not smart for a person,
you know,

945
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,223
he's not crying,
but you can talk them into just asking 

946
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,563
the question.
I don't want anybody to get upset and 

947
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:15,670
say,
I said anything about fighting dogs.

948
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:18,460
I know how sensitive some people are due
today.

949
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,293
You can't riff anymore.
You can't just talk off the top of your 

950
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:21,880
head.
Right.

951
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,920
You know,
like sometimes you,

952
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:24,970
you say some shit where you just 
exploring it.

953
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,833
Like why?
Why can't I come up with chickens and 

954
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,693
with dog and you might actually be only.
You might be the only reasonable way to 

955
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:35,560
do that was to say it's fucked up with 
chickens too.

956
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,903
That's the reasonable way.
But people would always misinterpret it 

957
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:42,250
and go with the worst way is to say 
what's wrong with fighting dogs,

958
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,710
which is not going to hear what they 
want to hear about,

959
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:45,544
but you were really saying,
why should you be able to fight check 

960
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,300
shit.
And we love chickens just as much.

961
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,193
That's what we eat them because they're 
delicious shit and they get the nod 

962
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:54,723
because they're delicious.
I went to an ashram once and this lady 

963
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,280
who was there,
she and I were having a conversation and

964
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,060
I noticed that she had ant spray and I 
said,

965
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,530
what do you do with the ant spray?

966
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,311
She goes,
well,

967
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:11,730
it's unfortunate,
but we have to use it because the answer

968
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,240
been getting to the garbage.
I go,

969
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:14,530
what?
I go,

970
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:16,600
you guys are murderers.
You guys are killing the ants.

971
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:19,030
And she started laughing.
She thought it was kind of funny.

972
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:19,864
She's like,
eh,

973
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,780
but she wrote a line.
That's one thing about Buddhists,

974
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:26,260
like a lot of Buddhists,
they don't take themselves too seriously

975
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,910
to the point where they can't like crack
out.

976
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,763
A little joke about that,
but the hypocrisy of the fact they're 

977
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,070
using bug spray and this is very good 
death spray.

978
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,090
You're killing all these organisms.
We just did,

979
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,973
but we decide that that's okay.
Whereas like if she was in her backyard 

980
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:44,590
was invaded by house cats.
She just went out shotgun,

981
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:46,330
right?
You can't do that.

982
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,433
You can't do that,
but you could spray the fuck out of 

983
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:49,430
these little bugs.

984
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,460
You've got to kill them.
It's like when things are a little,

985
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:53,810
we're like,
can't be bothered worrying about you too

986
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,740
little for this.
You would think though.

987
00:40:56,741 --> 00:40:58,270
They would.
Yeah,

988
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,950
yeah,
yeah.

989
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:01,240
You would think that they would,
uh,

990
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,700
figure out a better way to keep those 
ants out.

991
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,240
They're lazy.
They wanted to kill him.

992
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,480
Buddhist are lazy.
Well,

993
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,250
that one was,
we just learned today.

994
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,211
Well,
don't you think?

995
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:15,500
Like,
do you think there could have been a way

996
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,340
to clean them up with water not killed 
them?

997
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,420
Is that.
No.

998
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:22,000
You'd still kill some.
You'd still have to sweep them out.

999
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,180
Like you're a Buddhist outside,
but even then you're,

1000
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,820
you're murdering dozens and dozens of 
advance.

1001
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,610
If you just had a broom and you started 
hitting those ants.

1002
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,340
Get an ant eater.
If you're a Buddhist,

1003
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,560
because now circle of life type shit.
You know what I mean?

1004
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,050
Maybe get a burger,
get a chicken.

1005
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,620
Chicken,
chicken needs to eat.

1006
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,123
Yeah.
Then you get chicken shit all over your 

1007
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,350
kitchen,
but you sweep that up.

1008
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,910
That's not going to kill anybody.
That's true.

1009
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,120
Maybe that's the mood for.
For a Buddhist.

1010
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,720
They should have chickens outside 
knowledge.

1011
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,630
We've refined it answers here.
We get the answers,

1012
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,464
but get down to the bottom.
I wonder if they try to make their 

1013
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,380
chickens vegetarian here.
What does it say here?

1014
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,483
If you have an infestation,
use your vacuum to quickly get rid of 

1015
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:04,544
the invaders.
Then immediately entered the vacuum bag 

1016
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,530
in the outdoor compost pile or at some 
distance from your house.

1017
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,470
Do not use ant bait or poison like 
sprays,

1018
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:13,304
like rate that continued to.
They continue in the toxic waste stream 

1019
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,253
from their point of manufacturer to 
their ultimate destination in landfills 

1020
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:23,870
via runoff or sue or 12.
That's very conscious of them,

1021
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,310
so they're saying,
don't,

1022
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,160
don't use bug spray.
Just use a vacuum cleaner.

1023
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,280
You're still going to kill some 
guaranteed.

1024
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:36,660
You suck in those little tiny things 
into a huge metal tube.

1025
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:39,160
What could go wrong?
Get a chicken man.

1026
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,980
If you imagine.

1027
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,813
If somebody like assume that you would 
be okay and they use something that's 

1028
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,380
proportionate size to suck you off,
the earth will be fine,

1029
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,140
they'll be fine.
You land on a pile of other people,

1030
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,230
people you'll get sucked up at the same 
time.

1031
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:57,230
When you get smashed into each other,
you're broken arms and shoulders.

1032
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,123
I think that's ridiculous.
What would you do if there wasn't a 

1033
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,280
vacuum cleaner?
Mr Buddhists answer,

1034
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:02,130
man.
Huh?

1035
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,280
What if there's no vacuum cleaner?
Would you use a broom?

1036
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,890
A vacuum cleaner is gonna.
Fuck those ants say chicken.

1037
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,500
Chicken eats the ants.
Yeah,

1038
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:13,334
I think I like when you're doing.
I think that's a smart way of thinking 

1039
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,990
and eater even further,
but I think he was just like to get to a

1040
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:20,824
mound of dirt and just go to town.
I don't know if I need to like hunt 

1041
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:22,990
them.

1042
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,710
They stick their tongues in the ant 
hole.

1043
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:25,281
Right,
right,

1044
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:25,701
right,
right.

1045
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:26,580
And just,
yeah,

1046
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,713
tongues like sticky.
So it's just like it just eaten for 

1047
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:30,284
days.
But what if they wiped them out real 

1048
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:33,980
quick and then you got to fucking ant 
eater that you have to feed.

1049
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,560
And you've got to bring in and see like 
what kind of an asshole.

1050
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,473
My Isa Ido.
What eats the Amperes fucking Jaguar 

1051
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:45,730
black bear cycle.
Buddhists do.

1052
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:51,890
There is a crazy video that I tweeted of
these tourists walking through the woods

1053
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:56,660
and they're walking down a trail and 
they run into a fucking gigantic.

1054
00:43:56,661 --> 00:43:59,640
Grizzly bear is a terrifying video.
Wow.

1055
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,160
I,
I tweeted it.

1056
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,053
Yeah.
It's not on it.

1057
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,760
I didn't put it on instagram.
Dude.

1058
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:07,820
This thing is so big.
And now I called right back up.

1059
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,770
Back Up.
They got to wake up.

1060
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:10,883
Yeah,
I got away.

1061
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,043
Did you see the video of the poachers 
that went to kill the rhino and they 

1062
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,370
killer video of it.
It's A.

1063
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,360
I saw a picture,
I suppose still.

1064
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,470
Oh,
okay.

1065
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,030
Yeah.
I didn't know if they got a video,

1066
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:21,140
but yeah,
that's fucked up.

1067
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,270
That's fucking few.
Dude got jacked,

1068
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:24,104
right?
Tuna and sweet.

1069
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,750
That's the lions.
And we even look at this.

1070
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,430
Turn up the volume,
Jamie,

1071
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,893
to use my best.

1072
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,150
I don't want to use my bear spray.
He's a good boy.

1073
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,460
That's a good boy too.
He's coming around.

1074
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,170
That's good.
Can you come forward?

1075
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,210
Yeah,
motherfuckers.

1076
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,130
It's following them.
It's circling them around.

1077
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,390
Yeah.
He's the thing is circling him,

1078
00:44:56,391 --> 00:44:57,810
man.
It's going towards him.

1079
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,830
That's a good boy.
That thing is really the thing is coming

1080
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:06,890
way too close to him and it's like,
oh crap.

1081
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,200
He's huge.
Hell No.

1082
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,593
Yeah,
they got lucky that I would've been 

1083
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,583
gone.
The scary thing about that is that bear 

1084
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:19,950
could have just decided randomly through
some firing of his bear synopsis to take

1085
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,020
a left instead of a.
You go at him.

1086
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,700
He just,
he could have easily decided that,

1087
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,960
oh,
things crazy.

1088
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,410
Scared the shit out of me.
You know why man?

1089
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,530
We don't believe in things we don't see.
We don't believe in them.

1090
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,860
What do you mean you don't believe in 
things you don't see?

1091
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,880
You know it's real,
but you don't believe danger.

1092
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,110
No,
you don't believe in it.

1093
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,240
It's not a real thing in your world.

1094
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:43,110
Right?
If you were outside and you saw that,

1095
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:44,610
if you will,
with those people in Australia,

1096
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,450
you Billard oh Jesus Christ.
If I was there,

1097
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:49,740
I would know that.
That's the reality.

1098
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,990
That's really my world.
Does it evolve?

1099
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,660
Does it involve being somewhere near 
that close to a bear?

1100
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:56,690
So to see it in my world would be what?
The.

1101
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,590
I wouldn't be real.
Not like,

1102
00:45:58,591 --> 00:45:59,850
Holy Shit,
this can't be happening,

1103
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,253
but if you were with those people,
if you went on that trip with the I'd 

1104
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:06,100
be.
That would be fucking fellow.

1105
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,680
One of the craziest things you get out 
with you.

1106
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:08,514
Your whole existence gets down to the 
chance that this thing makes a decision 

1107
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:14,274
to go one way or another.
Otherwise it's just going to run you 

1108
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:17,610
down.
Just like life.

1109
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:20,200
If you go a certain scenarios you like 
bite,

1110
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,830
this shit can get real real fast,
real fast.

1111
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,270
You know?
That's one of them,

1112
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:25,860
man,
that his life,

1113
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:26,694
any inner city life is just like,
holy shit is this is a of a pop off in 

1114
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,470
here,
right?

1115
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,450
Like how many people died in Chicago 
last week?

1116
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,553
Some insane number.
There was a there reporting on the lack 

1117
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:39,444
of attention that the murders in Chicago
or getting in the national news and how 

1118
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:46,380
crazy it is.
I've been to Chicago several times.

1119
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,100
The one thing that sticks out to me 
every time I go to this house,

1120
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:50,040
segregated into this.

1121
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,370
Yeah,
I've never gone anywhere of a major city

1122
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:58,260
like New York is like we're all piled up
together for killed.

1123
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,560
Twenty four wounded and weekend 
shootings.

1124
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,790
God,
28 people got shot.

1125
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:08,310
Dude,
that is crazy.

1126
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,630
Twenty eight again in the afternoon and 
said,

1127
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:18,170
fuck standing on the sidewalk.
Jesus opened fire Jesus Christ,

1128
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:21,943
but there is a.
There is a war going on in Chicago 

1129
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:29,380
that's way more deadly than most of the 
wars were engaging in overseas.

1130
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,070
You don't hear about

1131
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,290
that.
Many soldiers dying every day.

1132
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,573
Now that's another.
That's another scenario how we said 

1133
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,040
like,
that's real.

1134
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,100
Yeah,
that's real,

1135
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,760
but here's your work outside and 
Chicago.

1136
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:40,594
That is a real fear that you should have
and this is what's the number of people 

1137
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:48,721
in Chicago this year passes 1400.
1,400 people shot.

1138
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,970
Now how many people do we know?
How many people got shot?

1139
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:56,740
Like doing tours of Afghanistan?
That's a good question.

1140
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,310
What does this.
This is the over the year.

1141
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,400
Just this year.
Okay,

1142
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,180
so let's Google.
How many soldiers were shot overseas?

1143
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:10,060
This here?
You know the.

1144
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,550
That's a weird thing,
man.

1145
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,403
We got a war going on.
If that was Mexicans invading North 

1146
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,473
Dakota and shooting people now,
many people were dying every day we 

1147
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:18,874
would be taking action,
but because it's happening to people is 

1148
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,810
1400 and a hundred of them were white 
people.

1149
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:26,644
It would be an issue.

1150
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:27,723
Oh yeah,
it was 1300 black people in 100 white 

1151
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:33,040
people.
It'd be now you really right?

1152
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,263
This is,
I mean it's something that people don't 

1153
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:36,370
talk about.
$300.

1154
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,800
Let me.
It's like a crazy.

1155
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:40,563
That's a weird statistic.
It's a terrible situation like 

1156
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:49,930
culturally to have something like this 
and with 1400 people being shot,

1157
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,823
that means.
And people don't want to realize this 

1158
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:53,943
is,
you know,

1159
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,233
post traumatic stress disorder is a real
thing in the ghetto as well as in the 

1160
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:02,110
hills of Afghanistan.
It's real of course.

1161
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:03,970
So when you see something that when 
people are like,

1162
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:05,890
why these guys have guns on them,
it's like,

1163
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,360
dude,
1400 people got shot.

1164
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,530
I'm just trying to get to school and 
back.

1165
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,850
Yeah.
I'm trying to get to work in back.

1166
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,690
Of course it's,
you know,

1167
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,930
we're not protecting those people.
It's exactly.

1168
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:21,040
If they were stuck somewhere overseas 
and some in the middle of some war,

1169
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,020
you know,
and they were American citizens,

1170
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,250
please help get us out like we gotta get
these guts.

1171
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,303
If there was a place that had like 
statistically the numbers of the south 

1172
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:33,580
side of Chicago where all these murders 
going down there a place to typically in

1173
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,503
another part of the world,
we would be set those numbers anywhere 

1174
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:38,560
else and it's a.
it's a crisis.

1175
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,480
If we had,
let's say Hawaii,

1176
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,970
let's say if we had just moved into 
Hawaii,

1177
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,233
just just took over Hawaii and then 
we're in an area where people started 

1178
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:51,100
getting shot and killed by local site 
that we would want to read.

1179
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,630
Want to extract those people from 
Hawaii.

1180
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,300
We'd scoop him up from an island.
We would think they'd be shooting at the

1181
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:57,340
helicopter says we rested.
Right,

1182
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:57,941
right.
Well,

1183
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:59,770
you just look at the real numbers,
just the raw number.

1184
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:01,690
That's a crazy number of people getting 
shot.

1185
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:03,810
And this year,
this is July,

1186
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,230
July.
Just started.

1187
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:08,470
How many soldiers got shot trying to 
find the wounded.

1188
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,670
I can only find a death.
Okay.

1189
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:11,523
What's the death?
It's only like 1500 total since like 

1190
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:19,570
2011.
Since 2001 man or this is since January.

1191
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:23,380
Seems weird saying only I know what 
you're saying.

1192
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,500
You're saying in comparison to the other
number since January.

1193
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,440
Yeah.
That's insane.

1194
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,780
That's crazy.
That is insane.

1195
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,260
And that's happening right here in the 
good old us of a,

1196
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:34,730
in one of the biggest cities in the 
world.

1197
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,013
Chicago's giant.
Awesome city and is happening in other 

1198
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:39,110
cities also that people don't know about
[inaudible],

1199
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,033
but Chicago is the most glaring because 
I don't travel around there so I don't 

1200
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:48,890
know what happened or why it happened,
why they have this segregation there and

1201
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,270
what it was all about.
Go to Chicago,

1202
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:51,104
man.
It's like black people all the way over 

1203
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:53,714
there.
Then is downtown where it's nice and 

1204
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,300
everybody's,
you know,

1205
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,530
Detroit has that too,
right?

1206
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,460
It's right as well.
Yes.

1207
00:50:58,461 --> 00:50:59,840
Yeah,
yeah.

1208
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,760
Um,
man.

1209
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,800
Then you go down south.
It's like that.

1210
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,370
Go to Louisiana.
That's crazy.

1211
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:11,060
You were the king or the president?
Tony Rock.

1212
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:12,920
I was the president,
how do you fix this?

1213
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,090
Uh,
you have to fix this.

1214
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,900
It's a process first.
I always say number one is education,

1215
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,540
right?
Education is number one.

1216
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:24,853
If you're just,
if you're getting a better education 

1217
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,033
than you just avoid the pitfalls 
naturally because you just know that 

1218
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,270
certain things are wrong.
And,

1219
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,000
and by getting a to see a better 
education,

1220
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:36,630
I mean you have opportunities to do,
you know,

1221
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:40,070
you have a music appreciation,
you have the arts,

1222
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:40,904
you have sports,
you have things to occupy you during 

1223
00:51:43,521 --> 00:51:44,354
school hours and afterschool hours.
There's no type of any type of extra 

1224
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:48,674
curricular,
extra curricular activities for these 

1225
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:50,504
kids in Chicago.
There's gang life which you are born 

1226
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:55,940
into what you are expected to go into 
once you are a certain age,

1227
00:51:55,941 --> 00:51:57,140
you alright,
you're a man.

1228
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,600
Now here's the gun.
We don't like those guys.

1229
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,030
Those guys don't like us.
You don't even question it.

1230
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,070
It's like my father has been this way.
My grandfather has been this way.

1231
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:05,480
My uncles a display,
my big brother.

1232
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:08,060
So this way you don't even if you're 
born right into it,

1233
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,180
you don't want it in a war zone.
You all right and you don't question,

1234
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,430
and it's a war zone where you sleep and 
your family lives right,

1235
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,343
not just a war zone with soldiers,
but a war zone with fabrics and another 

1236
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:21,020
thing better education you.
You're more worldly.

1237
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,010
If you see the world,
you realize how small that,

1238
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,590
how small your neighborhood is and 
there's a bigger world out there and you

1239
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,453
want to go places and see things.
Then you realize like what are we doing 

1240
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:31,304
here?
But these are people that I guarantee 

1241
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,123
probably never left Chicago for.
Probably never went on vacation to the 

1242
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:39,524
south to visit grandparents and realized
Danner South is nice and quiet and the 

1243
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:44,204
people are friendly and they've never 
been to the zoo and saw animal and went 

1244
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:52,150
home and googled the mating rituals of 
this.

1245
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,950
Open your mind,
open your mind,

1246
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:55,784
you see the world.
The stuff that you're involved in 

1247
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,430
becomes just so small.
This guy,

1248
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:03,500
I don't like Scott because he has read 
and I have on blue.

1249
00:53:03,501 --> 00:53:06,080
I don't get it.
So the education,

1250
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,570
that tiny little area,
you know,

1251
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:09,470
uh,
the,

1252
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,930
that he operates in with his living his 
life,

1253
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:16,910
he does matter that your reality is 
what's around you.

1254
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,103
Yeah.
So you get a good scope of a bigger 

1255
00:53:19,971 --> 00:53:21,110
world.
Like I grew up in the hood,

1256
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:22,100
I grew up in bed Stuy,
Brooklyn,

1257
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,380
but one of the wildest neighborhoods 
when I was going up there,

1258
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,970
but my vision was passed it.
My vision was,

1259
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,530
yeah,
this is going on outside,

1260
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:32,640
but I'm going to be there one day.
What do you attribute the,

1261
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,630
having the ability to do that to a,
having a mom and a dad?

1262
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,393
Pops.
My father worked two full time jobs my 

1263
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:40,740
whole childhood.

1264
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,920
My father literally worked 80 hours a 
week 80.

1265
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,220
So just to see him go everyday,
like damn this dude,

1266
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,770
this dude works hard,
man.

1267
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,663
Wow.
Didn't have a lot to show for it and 

1268
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:54,120
made sure his kids had mom was a 
teacher.

1269
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,720
Education was,
you know,

1270
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,380
she made an emphasis on it.
Wow.

1271
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,660
You know,
it was,

1272
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,040
it was like my friends,
my,

1273
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:02,923
my,
one of my best friends down the block 

1274
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,040
know dad,
my friend across the street.

1275
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,030
No Dad,
my friend.

1276
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,200
Two doors down.
No Dad.

1277
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:11,640
Then crack came and that was everything 
fucked up.

1278
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:14,230
Everything started.
Just the neighborhood started just to,

1279
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,690
you know.
Yeah.

1280
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:19,180
That was like crack was people that

1281
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:23,010
are alive today or young kids today.
They don't remember the eighties.

1282
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,080
Yeah.
There was a like a plague,

1283
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,430
a plague hit.
Everybody knew somebody that got hit and

1284
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,970
so many people's lives were gone.
Done,

1285
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:33,983
done over.
People who are doing fine and then all 

1286
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:37,704
of a sudden.

1287
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,720
Yep,
Yep.

1288
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,560
I remember it.
I remember it well.

1289
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,353
Yeah.
It was a weird.

1290
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,210
And I started losing friends.
That's what I,

1291
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,800
that's what happened.
I started losing friends.

1292
00:54:47,801 --> 00:54:49,750
I,
I saw like people don't.

1293
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,300
It was crazy man.
Like shit man.

1294
00:54:52,301 --> 00:54:55,270
This shit we saw.
I saw a friend get shot in the head,

1295
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,940
like talk to them on the corner.
Engage.

1296
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,591
What's up,
man?

1297
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:00,500
Yeah.
We're going to play ball later.

1298
00:55:00,501 --> 00:55:01,301
You wouldn't play ball.
All right,

1299
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:02,134
cool.
I'll hit you later.

1300
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,950
Turned to walk down the block,
look maybe you know,

1301
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,640
a thousand feet away and looked back to 
like just,

1302
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:10,474
you know,
looking around the neighborhood and saw 

1303
00:55:10,901 --> 00:55:14,650
a guy just kind of like he was.
He looked like,

1304
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,710
have you ever seen an old like big daddy
kane album?

1305
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,920
He had the flat top and a bunch of 
jewelry on,

1306
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:24,750
on the corner on the payphone.
This was beeper days and you got to turn

1307
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,863
and the guy ran up on him while he was 
returning a beat and just tried to rob 

1308
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,820
him.
And then he went for his gun and the guy

1309
00:55:30,821 --> 00:55:34,030
just boom right in his head,
right on the corner of my block,

1310
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:34,873
rised right on the corner of my block.
And I went home and my parents were 

1311
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,840
there and I was like,
this is crazy man.

1312
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,703
And that's where I grew up.
But my vision was not confined to where 

1313
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,140
I was.
It was going to be,

1314
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,330
you know,
fortunately I get outta here.

1315
00:55:49,331 --> 00:55:51,200
I'm going to do this and once I leave 
here I'm going to.

1316
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,190
You're very fortunate to have those 
kinds of examples.

1317
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,820
You know,
if your dad who worked out that you.

1318
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,840
I'm very fortunate.
That's awesome.

1319
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,393
Yeah,
man,

1320
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,413
it's hard for some people if they didn't
get the break that you got in that 

1321
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:04,960
regard.

1322
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,840
That's why I don't,
I have not missed on me.

1323
00:56:07,841 --> 00:56:09,550
Like I realized like if I didn't get 
that,

1324
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,770
I didn't catch that last Chapa

1325
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,410
good for you man.
That's uh,

1326
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,570
but that's,
that's where character comes from.

1327
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:20,020
Two means having someone like that as an
example.

1328
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,400
Like how like someone who can work two 
full time jobs

1329
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,930
and that is a force of will.
Most people struggle with one man.

1330
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:28,803
One is hard eight hours a day.
And my dad's rule was everybody had to 

1331
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:35,800
have a job at 14.
13 was your last summer.

1332
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,590
Enjoy yourself at the ball,
do whatever you wanna do.

1333
00:56:38,591 --> 00:56:41,020
14 you get in the job.
Wow.

1334
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,050
Yep.
No,

1335
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,860
he didn't play at all.
14 job.

1336
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,210
He's.
The thing is man,

1337
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:51,400
that's a bitter pill to swallow when 
you're young,

1338
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,533
but damn,
the dudes who go through that always 

1339
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,370
seemed like they have an extra gear.
You know,

1340
00:56:57,371 --> 00:57:00,280
I know a lot of dudes who went through 
like bootcamp type dads,

1341
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,270
they did not like it,
but they can do some shit.

1342
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,820
Like I'll just a little bit more shit 
that other people could do.

1343
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:07,923
You know,
they might not have liked the fact that 

1344
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:09,574
dad was always telling him what to do,
but these motherfuckers can hike 20 

1345
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,730
miles and not complaining.

1346
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,290
My Dad wasn't bootcamp,
but it was like,

1347
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,540
you're going to work.
That's not even a question.

1348
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:17,374
You're gonna work.
And then I have so many siblings that 

1349
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,580
his rule was,
you know,

1350
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,350
we all had to take care of each other.
So my oldest brother,

1351
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,690
of course,
he turns 14 first he's working,

1352
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,330
he gets paid.
You have to give everybody $5.

1353
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,580
You get paid today.
Give all your siblings $5.

1354
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:32,290
Wow.
Next brother gets a job.

1355
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:34,240
Now it's two brothers working.
Give everybody $5.

1356
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:35,470
Wow.
We all had.

1357
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,360
It was like a socialism.
Yeah.

1358
00:57:37,361 --> 00:57:40,300
My Dad just made sure it all worked.
That's cool.

1359
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,523
That's very generous to.
That's like everybody that's forcing 

1360
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:45,670
everybody to be in it together.
Right.

1361
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,290
That's smart.
And take a minute,

1362
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:49,620
and then it was,
the rule was it was a,

1363
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,250
if your brother is in a fight,
you're in a fight.

1364
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,640
So then it became don't fuck with the 
rock brothers because there's so many of

1365
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:54,760
them.

1366
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,630
You have to fight all of them.
So that kind of kept us safe during this

1367
00:57:58,631 --> 00:57:59,464
whole,
you know,

1368
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,820
wow,
that's awesome.

1369
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,710
And what a,
it's a bad situation to be in.

1370
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:08,660
But uh,
a great place to develop characters were

1371
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,280
opportunities,
different character.

1372
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,860
You know,
who you are,

1373
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,350
you know what you're,
you know that you know,

1374
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:19,390
you develop a sense of a goal and get it
work hard.

1375
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,020
No excuses,
nobody's doing it for you,

1376
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:25,990
nobody's coming to save you.
You're responsible for you.

1377
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,710
Yeah man,
we all need to have a little bit more of

1378
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:30,544
that in our life.
And then also a little bit more 

1379
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:34,420
community to absolutely know that.
Right?

1380
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:37,750
And we grew up in a time where it was 
next door neighbor could spank you.

1381
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,273
Lady across the street could grab you 
and make you sit down on the stupid 

1382
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,250
ticket.
Mother came home,

1383
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,683
the guy in the Bodega at the corner 
would tell you to sit inside into your 

1384
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:46,600
mother.

1385
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,411
Came home.
Yeah.

1386
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:48,244
People would,
uh,

1387
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,270
they would police the neighborhood 
police we live in,

1388
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,690
we live in.
Don't talk to my kid,

1389
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,100
don't touch my kid out.
Right.

1390
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:56,020
Get off my son.
Don't touch my child.

1391
00:58:56,021 --> 00:58:57,340
You know,
there's a lot of that.

1392
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,630
Well,
it's because somebody,

1393
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,520
man,
that's the weird balance.

1394
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:01,363
I've talked about this recently,
but my cousin I saw my cousin gets 

1395
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:05,590
smacked by some lady once when we were 
both,

1396
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:07,750
like my cousin is a year younger than 
me,

1397
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:08,584
so I might have been six and she 
might've been five somewhere around 

1398
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,090
there.
It wasn't any older than that.

1399
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,120
And this lady cuffed her right in the 
face,

1400
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:17,440
man,
she fell.

1401
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,130
This lady fell on the ice and my cousin 
just happened be there and she

1402
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,710
was looking at her on the ground and she
did not laugh at her,

1403
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:25,544
but the lady said she laughed and she,
the lady got up and she was just angry 

1404
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:28,244
that she fell and hurt herself.
She got up and smack my cousin right in 

1405
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:32,150
the face.
My cousin fell down,

1406
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:32,984
I remember seeing it and realizing I 
couldn't do anything about it to save 

1407
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:36,194
her,
to help her,

1408
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,580
you know,
I was a little kid too.

1409
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:41,120
And being terrified that this grownup 
person just smack this little kid in the

1410
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:43,550
head for something that wasn't even 
real.

1411
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,280
Like you don't want that either.
Right?

1412
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:47,690
It's like,
don't touch my kid.

1413
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:50,010
It's probably better.
Well,

1414
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,360
that's not long run crazy people.
That's not helping raise a child.

1415
00:59:53,361 --> 00:59:55,790
That's been as adult.
That's just a crazy.

1416
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:57,620
She was a crazy lady that lived in our 
building.

1417
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,780
That was always thing about living in 
apartment buildings.

1418
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,710
Right?
There's always,

1419
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,850
there's always somebody died,
right?

1420
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,080
Somebody's always died and you will be 
walking by that apartment going,

1421
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:10,250
what the fuck is that?
What is that smell?

1422
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,500
Smell.
Dead Body.

1423
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:13,370
When somebody,
uh,

1424
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,780
somebody died in the house,
dude,

1425
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:18,460
it is crazy how bad it smells.
It's so bad.

1426
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,260
People smell so bad when they die.
It's insane.

1427
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,150
I go,
thank God I never spoke.

1428
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:28,710
The entire floor smelled like a body.
It was so gross.

1429
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,880
Even after the body was going through,
it took a while.

1430
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:34,190
I'm sure for them to clean it.
I hardly remember.

1431
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,173
I just remember there was a terrible,
terrible smell in the hallway and then 

1432
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:40,340
they realized that this lady had died in
her,

1433
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,650
in her apartment,
so then they go in to get the body,

1434
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:45,650
but I don't remember how long it took 
for them to clean up the smell.

1435
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,673
The smell was unbelievably bad and then 
somebody moves in and all the neighbors 

1436
01:00:50,151 --> 01:00:50,421
like,
you know,

1437
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:51,980
somebody died in their.
Yeah.

1438
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,660
They don't tell you shit.
Tell you that's the dead.

1439
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:56,150
Now you will pass the dead house.
Don't they have to tell you now?

1440
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:57,500
Like if someone got murdered in the 
house,

1441
01:00:57,501 --> 01:00:59,930
I think that's a law.
That wasn't a law before.

1442
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,823
I don't think it was.
I think in some places maybe it was a 

1443
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:05,900
law that's not a law.
They just sell you a house with like,

1444
01:01:05,901 --> 01:01:07,040
hey,
whatever.

1445
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:09,060
And figuring out what happened to him.
Nothing but good times.

1446
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,380
Enjoy your house.
Fuck up.

1447
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:16,490
Nothing but good times there.
Bullet holes in the wall.

1448
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:17,420
Hey,
you bought it.

1449
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:19,520
Hey,
people get crazy in this neighborhood.

1450
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:22,010
They like to celebrate New Year's Eve.
Fourth of July.

1451
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,960
I don't know man.
You should probably know.

1452
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,020
Do you believe in haunted houses and not
really.

1453
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,040
No,
not really.

1454
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,280
I haven't experienced.
Right,

1455
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,530
so I don't.
I don't,

1456
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,020
I don't give it much thought.
I put it that way.

1457
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:38,930
I don't believe in ghosts,
but I don't not believe in ghosts.

1458
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,810
Have you experienced now normal?
Nope.

1459
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:43,543
But imagine you're out in the desert and
all the sudden you see an apparition 

1460
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:54,110
walk towards you in the desert and then 
this happened to you.

1461
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:55,310
Just imagine.
Just imagine.

1462
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,600
Okay.
I'm in the desert and it's nighttime and

1463
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,453
looks right at you and it looks like a 
teacher that you knew from like seventh 

1464
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,690
graders.
This is that night,

1465
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,070
that night,
and then it vanishes.

1466
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:08,330
It vanishes right in front of you.
Detail people.

1467
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,410
Uh,
yeah.

1468
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:10,563
What do you tell him?
My fucking seventh grade teachers just 

1469
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:13,580
popped up in people like,
oh,

1470
01:02:13,581 --> 01:02:15,170
Tony,
we got to get you to a doctor.

1471
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,410
Tony rocks gone crazy.
No,

1472
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,560
you know what you would do if you,
the people you trust.

1473
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,810
Even if the people you trust,
they'd be like you.

1474
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:22,644
Okay,
let me feel your head that never 

1475
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:28,440
experienced that.
I would put you on a kid.

1476
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,180
I would put you in a category.
Oh,

1477
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:33,270
Tony Rock might be crazy.
You'd have to go into that category.

1478
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,580
Then I'd have to accumulate more data.
I'd have to say.

1479
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:36,610
Well,
every time I talked to him,

1480
01:02:36,611 --> 01:02:38,880
it seems reasonable and intelligent.
He's really funny guy.

1481
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,200
I don't think he's crazy.
I think I was out there by myself.

1482
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:45,450
It was nighttime.
You know,

1483
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:46,873
today I was talking to the student once 
it pulls out his phone and starts 

1484
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:50,400
showing me pictures of clouds,
like,

1485
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:50,990
what does that do?

1486
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,290
Here's another one.
Look at this one.

1487
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:53,061
Here.
I go,

1488
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,150
what is it?
He goes,

1489
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,860
look at this one here.
I see them everywhere.

1490
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,090
I go,
what do you see?

1491
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,800
And he goes,
flying saucers.

1492
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,500
These just.
These are clearly ships from outer space

1493
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:05,010
and you during the clouds,
they're inside the cloud.

1494
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,810
Yeah,
he's got pictures.

1495
01:03:06,811 --> 01:03:07,644
His phone was like,
remember when Jack Nicholson in the 

1496
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:10,410
shining all work?
No.

1497
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,420
Play makes jack a dull boy.
Just types it over and over again.

1498
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,460
This dude,
his whole phone was just clouds.

1499
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:17,160
He shows me the pictures on his phone.
I was like,

1500
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,590
oh,
wow.

1501
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,520
Yeah,
that's a little different duty Ed.

1502
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:24,660
Hundreds of pictures of clouds and 
what'd you say?

1503
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,660
Know what to say.
It's grown man older than me.

1504
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,740
Was I going to say I'm okay?
I usually.

1505
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,210
That's what I usually say.
Okay.

1506
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:36,630
There's nothing to say.
You think those are spaceships?

1507
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:38,460
I'm looking at clouds and you think 
they're spaceship.

1508
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,620
Something's wrong here.
I don't want to be mean.

1509
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,810
It seems like a nice guy.
Okay.

1510
01:03:42,811 --> 01:03:43,720
It's probably okay.
Best Bet.

1511
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,573
Yeah.
What do you say?

1512
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,320
Yeah.
Yeah,

1513
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:45,991
you're right.
Hey man,

1514
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:47,460
maybe he's right.
Maybe he has some.

1515
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:50,990
They live glasses that I don't have to 
remember that movie with.

1516
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:56,580
I can see he's.
He's looking at those photos and he sees

1517
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:59,730
some shit that my puny brain can't see.
That's possible too.

1518
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,380
What if people can see stuff like that?
What do people can see some stuff and we

1519
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,253
should be so clear and onsite.
I think it's entirely possible that 

1520
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:11,370
people have sensors that can detect 
things and feel things.

1521
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:15,240
The real question is how many of those 
people are being honest about it and how

1522
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:17,040
often is it really happened?
Because people.

1523
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,300
The problem is there's a tendency.

1524
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,133
This is the tendency.
People love to pretend they have some 

1525
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:26,190
psychic power or they have some 
paranormal gift or they're different and

1526
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:29,730
exceptional in some way without earning 
it from everybody else.

1527
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:32,100
People love to do that.
Like I just have a sense.

1528
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,650
I have a sense because they liked the 
attention.

1529
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:35,723
Yeah,
I just know.

1530
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,653
I just know man,
I just have a fucking instinct that I 

1531
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:42,420
always go on my gut that that doesn't 
mean you're always right.

1532
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,433
So you gotta wonder like how many people
really do feel like something's wrong 

1533
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:47,280
when something's wrong.
Right?

1534
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,383
And how many people really do like know 
not to go to a place like something is 

1535
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:52,764
telling them not to go like something 
strong and how many people were just 

1536
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:57,960
full of Shit and how many people.
I think that the fact pretend they had a

1537
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,210
voice that told them not to do it.
I don't know about the voice,

1538
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:03,090
but I know that that's real.
That's an instinct to say,

1539
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,080
hey,
don't go there.

1540
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,220
Yeah.
A lot of times has been times in my life

1541
01:05:08,221 --> 01:05:11,880
where I just followed the instinct and 
ended up,

1542
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:13,950
you know,
I couldn't.

1543
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:16,260
I'm the one time something happened to 
my brother Brian,

1544
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:18,040
my brother Brian,
my favorite brother in the whole world.

1545
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,570
Everybody knows the other brother's a 
mad,

1546
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:20,170
right?
Everybody know.

1547
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:22,240
Everybody knows Brian's my favorite.
Brian got a guy,

1548
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:23,074
tried to rob Bryan in the neighborhood.
One day he got in a fight with a guy 

1549
01:05:24,561 --> 01:05:25,394
that got cut his face and he went to the
hospital and I was at work and my 

1550
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:30,490
brothers called me.
Like this guy tried to rob Bryan and,

1551
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:33,040
and I didn't know where the hospital 
was.

1552
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:35,680
I jumped on the train.
I took the train a few stops.

1553
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,960
I jumped off,
I jumped on another train,

1554
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,060
took it a few stops.
I'm like,

1555
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,680
fuck.
I jumped on another like,

1556
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,780
you know,
you had transferred in New York,

1557
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,673
the subway,
jump on third train and take it a few 

1558
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:47,620
stops and get off and come up to the 
street.

1559
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:49,360
And I asked the guy walking,
hey man,

1560
01:05:49,361 --> 01:05:51,100
do you know where Kings County hospital 
is?

1561
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,940
And he says right there,
and I had no idea.

1562
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:58,030
I just fucking felt that like I gotta 
get to my brother.

1563
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,160
Wow.
And I literally,

1564
01:06:00,161 --> 01:06:01,750
hey man,
where's he's like right there.

1565
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:03,573
And I just was,
I just felt like I got to find my 

1566
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:07,480
brother and that's all I was thinking 
about.

1567
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,050
Wow.
Yeah,

1568
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,110
I believe you.
I believe that's real.

1569
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:15,700
I know for a fact,
but I don't know about,

1570
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,830
you know,
say that they live glasses.

1571
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:18,320
I don't know.

1572
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,390
No,
I don't think that's real.

1573
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,313
But I,
I know there's something that happens 

1574
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:22,444
sometimes when you're thinking about 
someone and they call you because 

1575
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:28,420
sometimes it happens where this person 
is like so far out of your memory,

1576
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:29,254
right?
Like you haven't talked to them in a 

1577
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,160
year and a half and you're like,
dude,

1578
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:34,420
how the fuck did you know?
It was just,

1579
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,370
I was just thinking of you like,
man,

1580
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:39,940
I was just thinking about you just call 
them check and see what the wave is.

1581
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:43,090
So something.
Yet you put a frequency distro strong in

1582
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:45,070
the air that I think there's something 
to that.

1583
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:47,080
Wait,
what is this ghostbusters laws?

1584
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,640
Many states pass legislation in the 19 
eighties in early 19 nineties to protect

1585
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:55,750
sellers and real estate brokers from 
buyers claiming they were damaged by the

1586
01:06:55,751 --> 01:06:58,900
sellers failure to disclose the presence
of ghosts.

1587
01:06:58,901 --> 01:06:59,930
Wow.
This is good.

1588
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:00,883
These laws became known as ghost buster 
laws after the 19 eighties era movie 

1589
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:06,094
comedy,
Connecticut Ghostbusters Law first 

1590
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,480
appeared in 1990.
Wow.

1591
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:11,373
Psychological impact is a thing.
The psychological impact became in 

1592
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,510
nonmaterial.
Huh?

1593
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:22,420
Nonmaterial fact concerning real 
property.

1594
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,283
The overhaul also replaced the reference
to HIV with a reference to the 

1595
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:30,850
commissioner of public health list of 
reportable diseases.

1596
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:32,710
Reportable diseases.

1597
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,073
Huh?

1598
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:41,920
Wow Man.
This is all the.

1599
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,840
Yeah,
I mean I guess they have to do that,

1600
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:45,820
right?
They have to do that.

1601
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:49,240
I mean,
you don't want someone to know that.

1602
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,103
Like there was a house that I saw in 
boulder that was for sale is the house 

1603
01:07:52,711 --> 01:07:55,150
where Jon Benet Ramsey was killed and 
they couldn't sell it.

1604
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:56,833
I think they even changed the name of 
the street or something crazy like tile 

1605
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,810
and they still couldn't sell it and it 
was like a really nice house.

1606
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,510
People would just like,
no thanks.

1607
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:05,950
Wow.
That house.

1608
01:08:05,951 --> 01:08:07,000
It's just poison.

1609
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,680
That's like a Bundy right?
Monday.

1610
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:11,980
Damn.
Who?

1611
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,123
Oh,
Jay's house.

1612
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,840
Oh yeah,
it was.

1613
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,500
It wasn't.
What was it called?

1614
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:16,334
A rocky.
Rockingham tore down some fucking 

1615
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:20,960
psycho.
Could move there.

1616
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,300
You know,
want to live where the king lived.

1617
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:27,050
Partment though.
Are the Condo is still there?

1618
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,050
Keto Keto still lives there now.
Audrey's house was gone.

1619
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:30,880
But uh,
Nicole,

1620
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,990
the murder scene is still.
Oh really?

1621
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,110
Wow.
Why would you as a.

1622
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:39,850
That is a.
Why would they tear down old jays and.

1623
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:44,560
Well,
somebody just made a call that said,

1624
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,280
yeah,
that's,

1625
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,100
that was one of the ghostbusters law.
I want to.

1626
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,340
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.

1627
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:52,220
Yeah.
I'm wondering whether you know,

1628
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:53,103
your honor,
we're going to go back to a refresh 

1629
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,830
reference.
Ghostbusters law number one,

1630
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:02,470
they usually say ray Parker Jr as a 
character with this.

1631
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,290
I don't think in court they ever used 
those names.

1632
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:06,124
Right?
They just use like the docket number 

1633
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,350
statute.
You got to say go fuck.

1634
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:15,400
They allowed to say in court.
You got to come in and play.

1635
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,750
Yeah.
That's hilarious.

1636
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:22,000
Yeah.
Do something new.

1637
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:23,860
Have you ever been a place where it felt
weird?

1638
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:26,200
We found out that someone died there.
You ever been in a place where,

1639
01:09:26,201 --> 01:09:27,034
you know,
I've been in places that felt weird 

1640
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,850
because you know,
some violence was going to pop off and I

1641
01:09:30,851 --> 01:09:31,990
knew it.
I was like,

1642
01:09:31,991 --> 01:09:33,150
let's get the fuck out of here.
Right.

1643
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:35,980
As you can tell that's you.
You can feel that somebody's dying.

1644
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,520
No.
I was at a concert once in a brawl broke

1645
01:09:39,521 --> 01:09:40,354
out and I quit.
I was a security guard and I was a neil 

1646
01:09:43,361 --> 01:09:44,400
young concert,
ran it.

1647
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:46,840
It broke out and I put a Hoodie on.
I zipped it up.

1648
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:49,750
A covered my security outfit.
I'd walk right the fuck out of there.

1649
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:51,533
You out of your fucking mind jumping 
into this fray and getting clocked in 

1650
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:56,614
the head by somebody like people were 
fighting and they canceled the show and 

1651
01:10:00,551 --> 01:10:01,600
kicked everybody out.

1652
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,110
People are lighting fires.
I was at a.

1653
01:10:05,111 --> 01:10:05,944
What was it,
this not this boards when Dr Dre got 

1654
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:11,650
jumped in in a young buck,
stabbed the guy.

1655
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:12,573
Oh,
I was there and I was doing a show for 

1656
01:10:15,191 --> 01:10:16,024
upn.
This was back when upn was still a 

1657
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,640
network and one of the execs from upn 
was there with her young son.

1658
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:22,803
He will who wanted to see all the 
rappers and he's sitting at the table 

1659
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:27,310
with us and I saw like the Gi unit group
come in.

1660
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,593
Then I of death row guys come in and I 
saw Andres Group and I'm sitting there 

1661
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,910
and I tell,
I forgot the lady's name.

1662
01:10:33,911 --> 01:10:34,331
I said,
hey,

1663
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:36,070
you might want to get your kid out of 
here.

1664
01:10:36,071 --> 01:10:38,350
Something's about to go down.
She's like,

1665
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,100
what do you mean?
I'm like,

1666
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,740
it's about to about to go.
And she's like,

1667
01:10:41,741 --> 01:10:42,430
he's so excited.

1668
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:44,200
He wanted to see dre and he loves fifty 
cent them.

1669
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,930
Listen,
get this kid.

1670
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,160
It was a little white kid to.
I'm like,

1671
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,273
oh my God,
there's.

1672
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:49,173
Can I go say hi and I'm like,
you get them out of here and as the 

1673
01:10:52,091 --> 01:10:53,170
second time I said like,
Yo,

1674
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:54,130
you might want to really get them out of
it.

1675
01:10:54,131 --> 01:10:56,020
It's gonna pop off.
Boom.

1676
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:57,123
Dre gets punched in the face.
Malay young buck stabs guy and I'm like 

1677
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:02,310
told you Jesus.
And like two days later on set,

1678
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,060
she's just like,
how did you know that?

1679
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:05,343
Like,
I know that I know the energy in the 

1680
01:11:06,491 --> 01:11:07,324
room.
I could feel it.

1681
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:09,203
I've been around it too many times.
That's a crazy feeling to when people 

1682
01:11:12,581 --> 01:11:14,600
are about to do ridiculous.
Yeah.

1683
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,750
You see the,
you see the walk,

1684
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:17,010
you see the look,
you know,

1685
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:19,530
it's like,
it's sad,

1686
01:11:19,531 --> 01:11:20,850
but it's true.
Like when you grow up in the hood,

1687
01:11:20,851 --> 01:11:22,350
you have that instinct.
You have that,

1688
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,900
that look,
you look at a guy walked past you at one

1689
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:27,570
time and you look at,
look around the room and okay,

1690
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:29,580
it's about to go.
It's about to go.

1691
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:35,093
Yeah.
People that have never experienced that 

1692
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,760
probably wouldn't know what to do.
Right?

1693
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:39,990
They wouldn't.
They would think nothing of it like that

1694
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:40,824
lady.
Like she'd never seen those signs 

1695
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:42,890
before.
I've been on the road,

1696
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,250
uh,
this was recently,

1697
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:45,900
like maybe three months,
four months ago.

1698
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,320
I had a,
my feature feature comic with me.

1699
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,183
He's from Chicago actually,
and we're in a club after the show and 

1700
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:56,520
there's a couple guys talking in the 
corner and I said something to a girl,

1701
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:56,971
she's like,
Hey,

1702
01:11:56,971 --> 01:11:57,804
Tony Rock and have little small talk.
And she walks over to the group of guys 

1703
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:01,823
and one guy walks over and stands at the
end of the bar here and one guy stands 

1704
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:07,410
in the ball here and I turned to my 
friend Dave and I go,

1705
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:09,150
Yo,
you ever been a fight in a ball before?

1706
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,440
And he said,
no.

1707
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,490
I said,
get ready motherfucker.

1708
01:12:11,491 --> 01:12:13,840
Are you about to be in one?
Because I saw it.

1709
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,940
And then the third guy comes over.
So funny that comes up.

1710
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:18,810
And he's like,
Oh shit,

1711
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,910
you are a comedian?
And I said,

1712
01:12:20,911 --> 01:12:21,271
yeah.
He said,

1713
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:22,520
I thought that was you.
He was able to talk.

1714
01:12:22,521 --> 01:12:23,354
And I was like,
I thought that was a comedian guy and 

1715
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:25,293
psychotic a picture of it.
And I took a picture of them in these 

1716
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,240
calls that the guy.
But like,

1717
01:12:27,241 --> 01:12:28,060
yeah,
it was great.

1718
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,830
It wasn't him that he kinda just 
squashed it because he,

1719
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,190
I guess they didn't know who I was.

1720
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:34,480
Oh,
I was gonna go.

1721
01:12:34,481 --> 01:12:35,950
But because I said something to the 
girl.

1722
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,860
Oh No,
it was the comedian is hit.

1723
01:12:38,861 --> 01:12:39,910
And I'm like,
hey fellows,

1724
01:12:39,911 --> 01:12:42,520
what's up now?
I know I turned into the comedian like,

1725
01:12:42,521 --> 01:12:43,540
what's up guys?
How y'all doing?

1726
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:44,830
Y'All all right.
What'd you guys need to drink?

1727
01:12:44,831 --> 01:12:45,910
Let's do a round of shots.
You know,

1728
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:48,100
Dave's like,
that's just.

1729
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,450
How did you know that?
I'm like,

1730
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:54,510
I know motherfuckers going to go.
Yeah,

1731
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:57,310
if you ain't never been around violent 
people,

1732
01:12:57,311 --> 01:12:59,160
you probably don't smell that vibe.
Right?

1733
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:02,590
You smell that vibe.
That's a valuable tool to have.

1734
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:03,424
If you're in those places,
especially if you own the road in 

1735
01:13:04,871 --> 01:13:05,700
cities,
you know,

1736
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,480
catch yourself on the road,
you know?

1737
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,380
Maybe have a local friends like to let 
me take you to my friend's club.

1738
01:13:11,381 --> 01:13:14,470
We went to meet you someplace you like.
How do I get out of here?

1739
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,220
Where are we going?
Hey,

1740
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,100
my boys having a party at his house and 
I'm like,

1741
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:21,110
Oh,
you're up in the hill somewhere.

1742
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:24,080
He couldn't even know how to drop the 
car off the reference.

1743
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:24,914
I was like,
I don't know.

1744
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,840
The craziest ones are the ones that have
to take you in a shuttle.

1745
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,530
You have to park your car here.
Sorry.

1746
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:34,300
Are you fucking kidding me?
You're going into a shuttle to a party.

1747
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,130
The worst.
I was in Iowa one time.

1748
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:37,570
This is a true story.
I was in Iowa.

1749
01:13:37,571 --> 01:13:38,700
I was in a De Moines,
Iowa.

1750
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:39,693
Did the show.
There's not very many black people was 

1751
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:43,990
so shows up a group of white guys like,
hey bro,

1752
01:13:43,991 --> 01:13:45,400
you super funny man.
Let's go get a drink.

1753
01:13:45,401 --> 01:13:47,110
Let's go to the bar right down the 
street.

1754
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:50,080
I'm a New Yorker right down the street 
is literally right down the street,

1755
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:50,860
right?

1756
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:53,110
They get in a truck that he pulls the 
truck around,

1757
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:55,630
he pulls up,
he pulls a pickup truck,

1758
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:58,020
one of those four door pickup trucks,
big ones,

1759
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,040
and it's two guys in the front and 
they're like,

1760
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:00,970
hey,
jump in man.

1761
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:02,530
And I'm like,
oh Jesus.

1762
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,503
Fuck,
are we going right down the street and 

1763
01:14:04,601 --> 01:14:06,370
that would drive in for maybe 10 
minutes.

1764
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:07,443
Oh.
And he's trying to get a point of 

1765
01:14:08,741 --> 01:14:10,510
reference.
If I got to jump out the truck.

1766
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,620
It's Iowa is nothing as far as you can 
see.

1767
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,770
Right or left of the truck.
Just highway and grass.

1768
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:19,690
Right?
So there's nothing like my jump out.

1769
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:20,524
Which way?
I don't know.

1770
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:23,320
This is how girls have to feel every.
Yes.

1771
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,860
That feeling.
So we pull up at a barn,

1772
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,113
a barn and the two guys are excited.
They jump out and they run around the 

1773
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:32,460
other side of the ball.

1774
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:32,951
Like,
hey bro,

1775
01:14:32,951 --> 01:14:34,320
come on in this way.
And they.

1776
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:37,360
And they turn and I can't see them now.
I don't know.

1777
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:38,830
And I say to myself like,
Holy Shit,

1778
01:14:38,831 --> 01:14:40,360
this is,
this is how it's going to end.

1779
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:41,194
This is it right here.
And I turned the corner and I see the 

1780
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,880
neon light that says girls,
girls,

1781
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:46,714
girls.
I had never been so excited to see the 

1782
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:54,420
ugliest strippers and was like,
yes,

1783
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:59,700
yes I would have left.
There's this build the vcs what?

1784
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,740
All the dances because I thought I was 
going to die.

1785
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:04,450
Five seconds.
Oh my God.

1786
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:07,520
You thought they were taking you.
You go back behind there.

1787
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:09,910
There's chains hanging.
Exactly.

1788
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,700
Oh my God.
That shit's happened before.

1789
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,700
That's the crazy thing about people like
the worst thing you know,

1790
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:19,210
I'm watching the show vikings.
You ever watched Jamie got to binge.

1791
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,400
So good God damn show.

1792
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,130
I think I'm on season three or four.
I can't remember,

1793
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:25,173
but it's a good fucking show,
but it just shows you how brutal people 

1794
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:29,914
were back then.
Like every day someone's getting fucked 

1795
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:34,380
up on that show.
That shows a guarantee.

1796
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:36,280
People are going to die every app to 
check it out.

1797
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,660
People getting drowned,
people holding them underwater.

1798
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:39,573
People.
Little kids are killing people with 

1799
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:42,340
access.
Like it's crazy.

1800
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,203
That show is fucking crazy.
Every day people getting jacked and 

1801
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:48,280
murdered and killed.
You sound like you're like,

1802
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,770
that's fucking good show.
I enjoy it,

1803
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:53,620
but the point is like these people were 
like,

1804
01:15:53,621 --> 01:15:56,140
this was.
This was life for these fucking people,

1805
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:59,290
right?
That that was a real world.

1806
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:02,710
Real world reality.
Reality is what your reality is.

1807
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,830
It's like people are like people that 
don't understand your reality,

1808
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:07,360
well,
you're not from this world.

1809
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:09,330
This is,
this is a real thing to us to know how a

1810
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,233
going gonna pop off to know when a guy 
strapped to know when this is all 

1811
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:15,130
reality.

1812
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:19,410
What's crazy is that we like to think 
that that doesn't exist anymore and that

1813
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,550
that viking style of living doesn't 
exist,

1814
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:23,620
but it does.
They just used guns now.

1815
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,450
Right.
Just happened in like that with guns.

1816
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,673
That's all it is.
It's basically that same kind of like a 

1817
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:30,573
conqueror survivor mentality,
bullets and fuck you and fuck him and 

1818
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,670
the guys that run into the drugstore and
smashed the glass.

1819
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:44,230
That's pillaging Lynn wandering past.
It's as old as time.

1820
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:45,243
It's just confined to certain areas now.
It's not spreading out like the vikings 

1821
01:16:48,311 --> 01:16:49,144
did in giant boats and getting on the C 
and they're not doing it like the 

1822
01:16:51,911 --> 01:16:54,610
Vikings did it.
Some aspect of it was just,

1823
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:57,850
you know,
trying to discover new lands,

1824
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:59,590
you know?
Yeah.

1825
01:16:59,591 --> 01:17:03,700
They were trying to farm and chip does 
meet over here or there's gold here now.

1826
01:17:03,701 --> 01:17:05,650
They just do it because it's like,
I have to eat them,

1827
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:07,150
you know,
I want those sneakers,

1828
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:07,510
man.

1829
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:08,343
I wish I could see what it was really 
liked back then because it's like you 

1830
01:17:10,671 --> 01:17:12,320
watch the show and the show is really 
cool,

1831
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:14,870
but you know,
they're actors and they're doing a great

1832
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:15,704
job and everything,
but you still know they're actors and 

1833
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,240
you're watching them do things and 
everything's really well done.

1834
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,280
It's a really well done show,
but still you like,

1835
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:23,143
man,
I wish I could see it in real life to 

1836
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,300
just be where,
where,

1837
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:29,810
where was happening in real life.
Do you imagine?

1838
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:30,823
Just being alive back then when the best
clothes were made out of fucking animal 

1839
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:35,804
hides.
He just draped in buffalo skins and she 

1840
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,400
killed the buffalo.
You ate the village eight,

1841
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:41,680
the Buffalo.
Every.

1842
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:43,730
You're used every piece of it.
So they lived in,

1843
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:44,564
was closed.
It would take their boats out and catch 

1844
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:48,570
fish and bring them into.
People will be waiting on the dock,

1845
01:17:48,571 --> 01:17:49,850
see if they're going to eat tonight.

1846
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,610
And it was only like 200 people in the 
town.

1847
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:55,580
So for plague hit,
half the people would be dead,

1848
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,500
woman would have a baby right in front 
of you.

1849
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,120
Wrap it in a blanket.
And that was.

1850
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,780
That was it.
That's how people lived forever.

1851
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,980
People live like that and they lived and
they lived.

1852
01:18:06,981 --> 01:18:07,640
They didn't.
They,

1853
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,350
they actually live.
They thrived.

1854
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,260
Right?
But wouldn't you take this over that?

1855
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:13,190
I would take this.
Yes,

1856
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,210
they would.
They be like,

1857
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:16,190
you fucking asshole.
You want to be a viking?

1858
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:18,260
I want to drive a cadillac.
I would take,

1859
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:19,770
I would take the bottle of water.
Yeah.

1860
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,753
They'll be like,
no,

1861
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:20,961
no,
no,

1862
01:18:20,961 --> 01:18:22,210
fuck riding a horse,
dude.

1863
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:25,490
I drove in the escalate today.
That shit is so smooth.

1864
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,420
It's comfortable to see this,
but it's cool in here.

1865
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,363
I played music.
The music wirelessly charged my phone 

1866
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:35,620
right there on the site.

1867
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:37,003
They would be like,
you're an asshole if you want to live 

1868
01:18:38,061 --> 01:18:38,894
like us campers.
And then somebody doesn't have any of 

1869
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:41,624
that.
Fucking opened your door with a gun and 

1870
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:43,910
he.
Now he's the Viking.

1871
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:45,170
Exactly.
I need this.

1872
01:18:45,171 --> 01:18:46,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

1873
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,250
And if you don't take care of that 
problem,

1874
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:51,140
this is the thing that could never gets 
better.

1875
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,240
It's like a part of.
It's like if you,

1876
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:56,090
if you are a person and you had like a 
thing that was wrong with you,

1877
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:58,970
like a big cancerous legion on your leg 
and you just ignored it,

1878
01:18:59,010 --> 01:18:59,830
fuck it.
Whatever.

1879
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:00,980
Right?
Keep on trucking,

1880
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,570
right?
Yeah.

1881
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:07,730
That is exactly what any sort of crime 
infested area is.

1882
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:10,790
It's a problem that if you don't address
is not going to get any better.

1883
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:11,653
That's always going to get worse if 
people don't address the problems in 

1884
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:14,810
society until it affects them.

1885
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,280
What do you think they could do though?
Like how,

1886
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:20,030
besides just education,
how do you stop as much crime?

1887
01:19:20,031 --> 01:19:24,530
How do you give people like counseling?
You can get the guns out of Chicago,

1888
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,360
you can get the guns out anyway if you 
want to.

1889
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,070
You think so?
How would they get it?

1890
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,820
Would get most of the guns out right?
And get.

1891
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:33,020
You can get most of the guns out.
You can do that.

1892
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:34,183
But do you run the risk of taking guns 
away from people that could defend 

1893
01:19:38,601 --> 01:19:43,450
themselves in a really dangerous area 
that's filled with guns by taking by,

1894
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:46,580
by taking the guns out.
Like what about people that are also.

1895
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:47,414
So like,
who are you going to take the guns away 

1896
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:48,764
from?
You're going to take the guns away from 

1897
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:52,320
the lady who runs the bakery,
who carries a lot of cash.

1898
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,163
So lady under the lady that runs the 
bakery keeps our gun lady that runs the 

1899
01:19:55,821 --> 01:19:56,654
bakery that has a,
that has a business that provides goods 

1900
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:03,220
and services for the neighborhood that 
wants to protect that.

1901
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:05,570
Once protection keeps her gun.
Did you see that recent video?

1902
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,160
There's a crazy video of these two gals 
behind the

1903
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,830
stove and one lady took it yesterday and
got punched her in again.

1904
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:15,480
It comes back in Wales or in the head.
And then the other girl pulls a gun out.

1905
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,670
He keeps our gun.
Yeah.

1906
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:19,470
That she keeps her gun because shit like
that might happen.

1907
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:22,230
But that guy.
Now imagine if he had a gun,

1908
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,630
that's a good thing for people to see.
This is why.

1909
01:20:24,631 --> 01:20:26,070
And I'm not saying everybody should have
guns.

1910
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:29,520
It's a good thing for people to see 
because you only hear the other side.

1911
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:32,610
You only hear guns being dangerous and 
killing people.

1912
01:20:32,611 --> 01:20:35,880
You don't hear people like that lady 
that just saved herself.

1913
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:37,950
I'm getting the fuck beat out of her 
with a gun.

1914
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:38,790
I know.
I saw,

1915
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:42,120
I saw that video.
And then I saw the other video.

1916
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:45,300
Was a guy in a jewelry store?
Yeah,

1917
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:47,260
it comes in two,
three,

1918
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,030
two or three guys.

1919
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:49,440
Hoodies on.
Mask on.

1920
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,270
You see the guys coming through the 
door,

1921
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:53,820
pulling their mass down.
It's like on the camera.

1922
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:57,630
And then you see a guy walk away from 
the jewelry display.

1923
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,730
He walks in the camera shooting this 
way.

1924
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:00,564
So he walks out of range of the camera 
and when the guys come in and he comes 

1925
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:06,840
back blasting full.
Whoa.

1926
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,450
That guy keeps his gun.
Jesus.

1927
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,760
He just started shooting.
Soon as they came in,

1928
01:21:11,761 --> 01:21:13,100
guns out.
Oh Jesus.

1929
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:14,430
Yeah.
So what happened?

1930
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,790
It was,
it was customers in it too.

1931
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:18,180
So I know he hit one.
He first guy.

1932
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:20,220
Yeah.
And other two ran out.

1933
01:21:20,221 --> 01:21:22,230
And you see the guy running out of 
camera range,

1934
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:23,223
he imagined being in a fucking jewelry 
store trying to buy a watch for your 

1935
01:21:26,941 --> 01:21:30,120
wife in a gunfight breaks easement ring.
You just like,

1936
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:32,340
I'm so in love.
Me and my girl are going to get an.

1937
01:21:32,341 --> 01:21:34,470
A guy just comes in and you think this 
could be it.

1938
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,320
This is how I'm going to go.
Like my kids.

1939
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,640
You know what?
This is a sign we shouldn't get married.

1940
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:47,630
But she was scary.
I just have too much ptsd to get married

1941
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:51,960
right now.
That is hilarious.

1942
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,110
Yeah.
But she.

1943
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:54,290
You run a business,
you keep your.

1944
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,360
To keep your gun.
Yeah.

1945
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,580
He's just a guy on the corner of 20 guys
on the corner.

1946
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,600
Cops stopped him for his.
Okay.

1947
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,673
Taking these guns,
it's going to be hard to get 'em all 

1948
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:03,684
man.
And the problem is defining who gets to 

1949
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:07,950
keep one and who doesn't get to keep on 
this very sketchy.

1950
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,530
Let's have that argument later.
Let's get the guns verse.

1951
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:14,880
Well guys,
you're never going to get them back.

1952
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,730
Like if once you take them away,
whoever got the guns taken away,

1953
01:22:17,731 --> 01:22:18,564
they're never getting their guns,
but I know that you've got to take the 

1954
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:22,380
guns and then you have to,
there has to be more to just that you've

1955
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:25,890
got to take the guns and it has to be an
increased police presence.

1956
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,700
You have to take the guns,
have to be something to do with school,

1957
01:22:29,701 --> 01:22:30,534
lets out,
you have to take the guns and they have 

1958
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:32,364
to be a counseling for drug offenders 
and you take the guns and there has to 

1959
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:39,280
be jobs in the neighborhood.
You know,

1960
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,810
it's a lot of steps that have to cope.
But,

1961
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:42,540
but you can,
it can be done.

1962
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:44,580
Yeah.
Um,

1963
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:46,770
you definitely get the illegal guns,
right?

1964
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:48,660
If you could somehow or another get 
access to them,

1965
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:49,523
the illegal guns,
the legal ones are going to be real 

1966
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:52,374
tough because if someone has a gun 
legally and they haven't committed a 

1967
01:22:55,111 --> 01:22:55,944
crime,
it's going to be real hard to take that 

1968
01:22:57,991 --> 01:22:58,824
gun away from that.
But I don't think if they did the 

1969
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:02,610
numbers,
the guys with legal guns aren't the guys

1970
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:04,160
that are committing crimes,
right?

1971
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,010
The guy with a legal gun,
I'm pretty sure it isn't

1972
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,870
the guy that drove past this particular 
shot up.

1973
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,153
Then you've got to worry about the 
people with legal guns getting robbed 

1974
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:12,420
for their guns.
Right.

1975
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:13,370
You know,
um,

1976
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:16,510
if guns become a shortage,
the whole thing is very,

1977
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:18,040
it's a,
it's a real problem.

1978
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:19,130
And it's very,
um,

1979
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,840
it's very complicated I think to try to 
completely solve it.

1980
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:28,470
And how do you get these people that are
in that life that are every day involved

1981
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:32,530
in gang violence?
And I don't think I could be wrong.

1982
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:35,140
I don't think everybody that's in gang 
life wants to be there.

1983
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:36,340
I think you're right.
No,

1984
01:23:36,341 --> 01:23:38,110
I think you're definitely right.
I think they just like,

1985
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:40,780
what the fuck else is there to do in 
this neighborhood.

1986
01:23:40,781 --> 01:23:41,410
I,
right.

1987
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:43,720
You're right.
I think if they had an opportunity to,

1988
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:44,583
you know,
I think they got the kid that is a very 

1989
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:49,470
good basketball player,
that his uncle was it,

1990
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:50,730
like I said,
his family lineage,

1991
01:23:50,731 --> 01:23:51,640
his gang life.

1992
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:55,690
If he had a chance to go play basketball
somewhere,

1993
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:58,720
he would take that chance.
I think you're totally right and I think

1994
01:23:58,721 --> 01:23:59,554
in the absence of any other chances 
that's when it becomes something that's 

1995
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:03,630
an option.
Right?

1996
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:04,463
Yeah,
and I think it's all about the same 

1997
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:07,144
feeling that people get when they're 
joining gangs or when they're like a 

1998
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,880
staunch right winger or a staunch left 
winger.

1999
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:17,860
I think it's all the same thing.
It's like people have a desire to belong

2000
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:18,870
to something.
Absolutely.

2001
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:21,130
To make something that makes your life 
have more meaning.

2002
01:24:21,131 --> 01:24:24,220
I feel like it has more meaning and then
when you don't have that,

2003
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,440
you'll get behind anything you get 
behind anything.

2004
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:27,803
Like I say on instagram all the time,
it's like I told my little brother just 

2005
01:24:30,611 --> 01:24:31,444
yesterday.
It's the reason why they call them 

2006
01:24:33,071 --> 01:24:35,400
followers because they just want to get 
behind shit.

2007
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,720
They don't even understand.
Yeah.

2008
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:38,053
If you like,
I get my instagram is hilarious because 

2009
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:41,740
I get a lot of people like I'll get 
girls that are like,

2010
01:24:41,741 --> 01:24:42,574
Hey,
I love what you're doing.

2011
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,430
I saw your shows.
Then I get the random guy.

2012
01:24:44,431 --> 01:24:45,730
I was like,
your shit.

2013
01:24:45,731 --> 01:24:47,590
You just Chris's brother,
you ain't shit.

2014
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:48,940
And it's like,
dude,

2015
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,430
that's what you like.
You think that's gonna hurt me,

2016
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:54,910
but if you just want it to be involved 
in this,

2017
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:56,530
you just want it to be a part of it.
You didn't.

2018
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,210
You wanted my attention.
You didn't know how to get it.

2019
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:59,223
Well,
the problem is the desire to do that in 

2020
01:24:59,951 --> 01:25:01,450
the first place.
So who the fuck are you?

2021
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:02,440
Like,
why would you want to do that?

2022
01:25:02,441 --> 01:25:07,441
Why did you want to make somebody feel 
bad for no reason for what we want to be

2023
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,140
involved in.

2024
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:09,340
In some capacity?
Yeah.

2025
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,960
Here's a tip to anybody that thinks like
that.

2026
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,640
There's no way.
You're not a loser.

2027
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:13,683
It's impossible.
There's not a single winner alive that 

2028
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:17,880
would write something like that.
Absolutely.

2029
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:18,723
Do you think like maybe like Michael 
Jordan goes trolling through instagram 

2030
01:25:21,851 --> 01:25:22,870
accounts,
looking for shit,

2031
01:25:22,871 --> 01:25:23,651
Yay.
Shit.

2032
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,680
Without your brother keep badgering,
you had to sign with the Lakers,

2033
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:29,840
beat the fuck out of here.
That's what it loses it.

2034
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:34,330
Winners and losers always have an excuse
for why you're not winters.

2035
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:35,710
It's weird,
you know,

2036
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:37,143
and I think it's a lot of it is people 
not having good examples around them 

2037
01:25:40,581 --> 01:25:44,040
when the grown up getting fucked over 
being in a bad situation.

2038
01:25:44,041 --> 01:25:44,874
It's like we're just developing shitty 
people or at least people that have 

2039
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:48,394
shitty ideas in these cycles where it 
just doesn't ever get better in certain 

2040
01:25:52,691 --> 01:25:53,471
spots.
I agree.

2041
01:25:53,471 --> 01:25:54,910
I think we're making more shitty people 
now.

2042
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,130
It's more shitty people that before I 
agree with,

2043
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,440
but I feel like we can put a curb on 
that.

2044
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:02,380
I feel like slow it down.
How do we curb.

2045
01:26:02,381 --> 01:26:04,220
People have to change the way they think
about shit.

2046
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,053
It's this,
it's this time is too short to be 

2047
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:08,640
shitty.
You know,

2048
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,520
when everybody's been shading.
I've been shitty before.

2049
01:26:10,521 --> 01:26:12,980
I'm sure you've been told Jamie shitty 
the other day.

2050
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:13,880
Remember,
I'm just kidding.

2051
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:16,210
We all have been,
you know,

2052
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,380
it's just people have to figure out a 
way to do that.

2053
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:19,214
Less and resist the urge to do it.
That urge to do it as a batter or it 

2054
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:24,170
doesn't help anybody.
You just.

2055
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,210
You just feel good because you've made 
somebody feel bad.

2056
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:27,890
Like for what?
You don't even know Tony Rock.

2057
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:30,350
Why you talking shit to him.
Like what is that dude?

2058
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,453
Fuck you in Bro.
But that's the reason why I know about 

2059
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:35,830
him in the first place.
He was Fuckin Loci or no,

2060
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,000
but that's like a fake that that's like 
a fake,

2061
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:41,913
a sense of feeling better about yourself
because it doesn't really make you feel 

2062
01:26:45,141 --> 01:26:47,370
better,
but it doesn't at all and if it does,

2063
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,880
it clearly doesn't affect me.
It doesn't hurt me one bit.

2064
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:50,763
It also defines you to yourself because 
you know you're not a winner because 

2065
01:26:53,651 --> 01:26:54,484
it's impossible.
You think Elon Musk goes in and trolls 

2066
01:26:57,461 --> 01:26:59,460
on twitter and says means shit to 
people.

2067
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:02,590
Talks about girls assets.
He doesn't have the time for that.

2068
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:03,520
Right?
He's a winner.

2069
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:07,240
He's busy rescue in that they got those 
kids out of the cave and Thailand.

2070
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:08,123
Yeah.
That's one of those baby in a well type 

2071
01:27:11,411 --> 01:27:13,450
things.
Every few years,

2072
01:27:13,451 --> 01:27:14,920
like a little kid falls into a,
well,

2073
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:17,230
why does that happen?
I don't know,

2074
01:27:17,231 --> 01:27:18,064
man.
We need to fix.

2075
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,620
Or that shit should not be an option 
year.

2076
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:24,280
That's when his pinky finger off on the 
July.

2077
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:26,350
Fourth happens every year.
You would think people would learn,

2078
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,510
oh,
that's probably happening all year round

2079
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:31,690
Texas places we can go to Mexico real 
quick.

2080
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:36,580
Sneak over there and by firing every.
Every fourth of July in Brooklyn is like

2081
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:38,343
Mike lost his finger.
I bet if they had a video across 

2082
01:27:40,391 --> 01:27:41,224
America,
you know how they have those time lapse 

2083
01:27:42,551 --> 01:27:43,384
videos and you could see every kid ever 
documented that lost a finger in a 

2084
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:47,194
firecracker accident,
like hands are at war with a 

2085
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:56,110
firecracker.
You can just look across the country and

2086
01:27:56,111 --> 01:27:56,944
see from.
From California to New Jersey and just 

2087
01:27:59,711 --> 01:28:03,670
see every movie like,
Oh my God,

2088
01:28:03,671 --> 01:28:07,780
that one pocket,
which is every year,

2089
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:10,370
every year.
What did you see?

2090
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:13,540
The NFL player.
They've posted a picture of his hand.

2091
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,000
People,
Jason,

2092
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:19,000
Jason Pfo show it to me.
It's like,

2093
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,330
to me it's like,
oh no.

2094
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:22,793
Yeah,
it's bad.

2095
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:26,160
Oh Shit.
What happened?

2096
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:27,660
That was July fourth,
last year,

2097
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,100
two years ago.
Two years ago.

2098
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:32,520
He blew up his hand.
He's a basketball player.

2099
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,770
Oh my God.
Him Eighty in his hand.

2100
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:36,630
Oh my God.
So he lost fingers.

2101
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:40,290
Millions of dollars.
So that was it.

2102
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,713
He played again.
So he came back and played with a cast 

2103
01:28:43,201 --> 01:28:44,700
on his hand,
but he.

2104
01:28:44,701 --> 01:28:47,220
Was He still playing?
He got traded to the Tampa Bay.

2105
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:50,290
He can play football as a defense.
He has.

2106
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:54,620
Oh,
okay.

2107
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:56,190
He's defense.
Stewed.

2108
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,820
What in the fuck though?
He blew his thumb off man.

2109
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:00,620
And it's,
we're a pointer.

2110
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:01,920
Finger Index.
Finger

2111
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:03,990
fingers on.
I don't know what that is.

2112
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,460
That's the middle finger.
Middle Finger.

2113
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:09,420
Middle Finger ring and Pinky.
Jesus.

2114
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:11,940
Fuck man.
That is terrifying.

2115
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,113
Wow.
He shared that on the fourth video was 

2116
01:29:19,081 --> 01:29:21,420
like be careful in the fourth and I just
had good for him.

2117
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,250
Good for him.
Yeah.

2118
01:29:23,251 --> 01:29:26,010
Fuck those things man.
They're too easy to get in some spots.

2119
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:27,413
You know,
like if you're on a border city just 

2120
01:29:29,221 --> 01:29:30,054
sneak over to Juarez.
We wouldn't even see him in Brooklyn 

2121
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,284
until around around the fourth.
And they disappeared after I took a 

2122
01:29:36,031 --> 01:29:38,490
drive to Tijuana.
Once we're working in San Diego,

2123
01:29:38,491 --> 01:29:39,324
La Jolla La Jolla comedy store.
We took a drive right down to Tijuana 

2124
01:29:43,351 --> 01:29:45,290
and see.
There's a weird feeling you get with.

2125
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,550
This was in the nineties.
Men.

2126
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:50,460
This is like when it was still want to 
come back.

2127
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,860
Now people go there for cheap dental 
work.

2128
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:55,743
They do.
People cross the border to go to a 

2129
01:29:57,811 --> 01:30:02,180
dentist to go to a dentist.
Dentists really super cheap.

2130
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:03,220
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

2131
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,600
No cost of living over there.
This is in Beverly Hills.

2132
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:10,200
You want that dude to play prime real 
estate.

2133
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,600
You need to get paid.
You want to.

2134
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:13,500
Yeah.
You want a dentist?

2135
01:30:13,501 --> 01:30:15,210
It's like really hustling.
Not a dentist.

2136
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:16,453
It's easier if women go down into the 
butt injections also down they go to do 

2137
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:21,450
that.
I think it fake titties.

2138
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:23,610
And what injections.
Really?

2139
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:27,500
Nah Man in hotel rooms go to a hotel.
What is that?

2140
01:30:27,501 --> 01:30:29,220
What is that?
The map is.

2141
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:32,070
Here's the border and there's all the 
dentist right on my street,

2142
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:34,380
right on the main street.
Right off the border.

2143
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,273
Isn't that crazy?
So you pick who's the first guy right 

2144
01:30:37,241 --> 01:30:38,180
there.
Central?

2145
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:39,043
Yeah.
That you want a clinic for cosmetic 

2146
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:41,634
dentistry.
Holla at your boy when it gets pearly 

2147
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:44,604
white son.

2148
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:48,080
I'm tired of these marijuana and coffee 
stain choppers.

2149
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,160
I'm going down there.
I'm going to come back pretty.

2150
01:30:50,161 --> 01:30:52,710
I'm not going to say Shit Jamie.
I'm just going to disappear.

2151
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,553
I've been to on them and I'll tell you 
I'm going on a hunting trip and then 

2152
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:58,430
I'll strike out and then I'll come back 
with some shiny.

2153
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:01,830
The limited doing.
They're going to Miami for the weekend.

2154
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:02,664
They come back from Tijuana was tied and
the other one fake tits are weird one 

2155
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:10,380
man because we'd never accept anything 
like that on a dude.

2156
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:14,520
But I grew up with like take it like if 
a guy like fake traps.

2157
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:15,443
I just liked the look guys just put fake
trap thing because they filed the girls 

2158
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:21,930
like traps.
If there was a one thing like that,

2159
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:26,380
but there was nothing that a guy could 
not even close it.

2160
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,263
Nothing's even close.

2161
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,260
So we were like,
I'll take it,

2162
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:29,303
I'll take it.
We don't care where so much easier than 

2163
01:31:31,531 --> 01:31:32,520
them.
That's what it is.

2164
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:34,980
That's why.
That's why we have so many.

2165
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:35,823
You Got Youtube site fake.
Have a fake ass guys like you right 

2166
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:39,900
there.
Don't care guys with a fake ass.

2167
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:43,350
You imagine if a girl was like you,
your book is so big,

2168
01:31:43,351 --> 01:31:44,700
you must be upheld.
Jumped so high.

2169
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:45,521
I think I was like,
no,

2170
01:31:45,521 --> 01:31:47,210
I have my blood done last year.
Girl.

2171
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:48,920
Be like,
why did you.

2172
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,140
What did you guys don't care?
And then he said,

2173
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,490
ready?
He said,

2174
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:56,940
I got my butt done.
That's what he said.

2175
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,160
I got my nickname.
They'd have a negative often,

2176
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:03,160
but on guys don't care.
We just like.

2177
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,020
My cousin used to have a joke.
He said,

2178
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:06,190
I don't give a fuck what's in your 
titties?

2179
01:32:06,191 --> 01:32:06,990
Just fuck me.
No,

2180
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:09,010
Whoa,
that guy's aggressive.

2181
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,480
That's funny.
Yeah.

2182
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:17,973
Well,
if women can hear the ridiculous shit 

2183
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:23,080
that men say when they're not all the 
time,

2184
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,093
all the shit that makes us laugh.
That's the gross is people try to 

2185
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:29,350
pretend that we mean everything we say 
too,

2186
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:34,990
especially common with men in comics,
but right now men in comedy,

2187
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:36,020
men in Compton.
Right,

2188
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,120
right.
That's the problem.

2189
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,370
Just like sometimes some of this stuff 
was just joking,

2190
01:32:39,371 --> 01:32:42,100
you know,
like stop being so serious.

2191
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,930
We most of it will.
Just joking.

2192
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:44,983
Yeah.
Do you find that this is a more 

2193
01:32:46,211 --> 01:32:47,044
sensitive time for comedy?
That's what I'm being told and that's 

2194
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:50,734
what I see in the news,
but I refuse to change anything I do 

2195
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,650
kind of can't write.

2196
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:00,310
I'm not doing it.
I'm not saying jokes and having to issue

2197
01:33:00,311 --> 01:33:02,950
a statement later.
It's like I was saying in joke,

2198
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:04,000
man,
if you didn't take it,

2199
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:06,370
if you didn't take it the way I 
interpreted it,

2200
01:33:06,930 --> 01:33:08,860
if you interpreted it the wrong way,
that's on you.

2201
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:10,670
I'm not doing it.
Yeah.

2202
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:13,090
It's just supposed to be funny.
Stupid.

2203
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:15,070
Right.
It was funny to somebody.

2204
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:16,443
You know,
it's weird that it's okay to do in a 

2205
01:33:17,981 --> 01:33:18,814
movie.
Like you could have some ridiculous 

2206
01:33:19,721 --> 01:33:20,554
scenes in the movie,
but when you have a ridiculous thing 

2207
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:23,854
that you're saying,
like people take it as a fact because 

2208
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,120
not even because.
Yeah,

2209
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:27,750
right.
Yeah.

2210
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:29,200
There's no acting.
It's like you said it.

2211
01:33:29,930 --> 01:33:33,790
Rogan believes this,
this thinks that.

2212
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:34,643
Yeah.

2213
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:38,230
It's interesting.
I think this is a,

2214
01:33:38,231 --> 01:33:42,580
like a very unique time in communication
for people.

2215
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:46,210
It's one of the reasons why stand up is 
a little bit more challenging right now,

2216
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,160
but I think that's all good thing,
man.

2217
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,750
Challenging is good.
Good.

2218
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:53,470
It's good.
Make for a better product.

2219
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:54,700
Yeah.
It's all good.

2220
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,283
It's all good.
It's all interesting what you been 

2221
01:33:58,421 --> 01:34:01,690
working mostly these days.
I'm on the first quarter.

2222
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:04,110
I was a on what Mike Epps?
Mike Epps.

2223
01:34:04,111 --> 01:34:08,740
Uh,
we went out from January to like march,

2224
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:10,690
April,
and then I do my own thing.

2225
01:34:10,691 --> 01:34:12,190
You went on tour tour?
Yeah.

2226
01:34:12,191 --> 01:34:13,180
Yeah.
The real deal.

2227
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:14,740
Every week.
Mike brings him out,

2228
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:16,120
man,
like 10,000,

2229
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:18,870
12,000.
Jesus Christ credible.

2230
01:34:18,871 --> 01:34:21,280
And when you do a tour like that,
man,

2231
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,690
and you're doing how many nights a week?
Uh,

2232
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,150
we do Friday and Saturday.
If it's three.

2233
01:34:25,151 --> 01:34:26,590
If it's a three day weekend,
which was Sunday.

2234
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:27,790
Oh,
so every week,

2235
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:28,061
Friday,
Saturday,

2236
01:34:28,061 --> 01:34:28,601
Friday,
Saturday.

2237
01:34:28,601 --> 01:34:30,470
And then are you working in the city at 
all?

2238
01:34:30,471 --> 01:34:32,680
Are you working in here?
I'm always working in the city.

2239
01:34:32,681 --> 01:34:33,930
I'm always working with you.
Yeah,

2240
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:35,140
yeah,
yeah.

2241
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:37,000
That's a.
That gets you sharp as fuck.

2242
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:37,661
Right?
Right.

2243
01:34:37,661 --> 01:34:40,420
And then I do that and then from there I
do 20,

2244
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:44,320
maybe 25 minutes with Mike.
Then when that leg is done,

2245
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:48,970
I do from April,
May to October,

2246
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:50,170
September,
October.

2247
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:52,840
Funny Bones,
Improv comedy clubs,

2248
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,360
more intimate settings with the guys I 
bring out.

2249
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,470
Yeah.
And we do that until,

2250
01:34:57,471 --> 01:34:58,460
you know,
Ellie needs me,

2251
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,353
I'll be on the road and now we just,
they just added more dates for Mike for 

2252
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:02,804
the fourth quarter.
So we doing west coast now we're doing 

2253
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:08,960
Portland in San Fran and Oakland and San
Diego in California and Phoenix.

2254
01:35:08,961 --> 01:35:10,910
And it's going to be incredible,
man.

2255
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,670
You're one of those guys where I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?

2256
01:35:13,671 --> 01:35:16,970
Like how come people have caught on the 
fact that Tony Rocks one of the funniest

2257
01:35:16,971 --> 01:35:17,721
guys alive?
Yeah,

2258
01:35:17,721 --> 01:35:18,550
I,
I've had it,

2259
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:20,560
the lady at the show the other night,
she said,

2260
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:23,980
I think the whole world is sleeping on 
it,

2261
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:27,750
and I said that's the fucking best 
compliment I ever had.

2262
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:28,603
Like his man,
you've been under the radar but getting 

2263
01:35:30,011 --> 01:35:31,490
better.
Like I remember I got.

2264
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:34,210
That's all that matters.
As long as I'm getting better,

2265
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:35,463
I'll pop up on your radar at some point.
I don't remember how long ago this 

2266
01:35:37,481 --> 01:35:39,400
conversation was,
how long you been doing comedy now?

2267
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:41,020
Ninety eight.
Ninety eight.

2268
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:44,410
So I think we had this conversation more
around the year,

2269
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:45,910
2000 ish.
It was,

2270
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:49,510
it was fairly recent in like you started
doing standup.

2271
01:35:49,511 --> 01:35:52,900
We were talking at the laugh factory and
I remember coming up to you and go,

2272
01:35:52,901 --> 01:35:54,250
dude,
you got good.

2273
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:59,190
Like you got good like you,
you really made a big jump and Damon and

2274
01:35:59,191 --> 01:36:00,400
you were saying,
I'm working man.

2275
01:36:00,401 --> 01:36:02,730
I'm out here working every day.
And uh,

2276
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:04,810
I remember watching that set and 
thinking,

2277
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:06,153
I don't remember what year this was,
but I want to say it was like 2002 or 

2278
01:36:08,561 --> 01:36:10,840
three or something like that.
Watch this settles,

2279
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:11,401
like,
Oh dude,

2280
01:36:11,401 --> 01:36:12,430
this guy is about to pop.

2281
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:14,830
Nice.
Nice.

2282
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,061
Yeah,
I'll,

2283
01:36:16,061 --> 01:36:16,894
I'll,
I'll be under the radar until I'm the 

2284
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:18,940
man.
That's the thing.

2285
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:19,774
Every time I see you getting better that
that radar is a good thing and then 

2286
01:36:22,091 --> 01:36:22,781
people will say,
oh,

2287
01:36:22,781 --> 01:36:24,400
he blew up.
But not knowing that.

2288
01:36:24,401 --> 01:36:25,640
Like you said,
it was 2000.

2289
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:26,503
We had this conversation.

2290
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:31,140
It's a fucking grind baby you to be,
you gotta be in it.

2291
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:32,463
So a lot of guys,
a lot of guys I work with at the laugh 

2292
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:33,750
factory,

2293
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:34,810
you know,
I see them all the time.

2294
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:35,653
Ron Rubin,
Paul,

2295
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:36,400
goofball.
Sure.

2296
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,250
I.
Ruben Paul,

2297
01:36:37,251 --> 01:36:38,910
he's working.
I see a,

2298
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:43,110
I see a hello everybody.
I can't think.

2299
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,590
Think of the names of most of Nathan's 
Rubin I see all the time.

2300
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:49,250
He does his own room there now and he 
has a Tuesday night show that he does.

2301
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:50,570
It's like we,
we,

2302
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:51,440
we in the trenches,
man,

2303
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:53,390
we work in.
That's how to do it.

2304
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:54,303
It's the only way to.
It's the only way in this crazy 

2305
01:36:56,751 --> 01:36:58,820
business.
It's a weird businessman and it's just,

2306
01:36:58,821 --> 01:37:02,510
you know,
if you stayed in that work mode,

2307
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,460
so much stuff going on in the world,
on,

2308
01:37:04,461 --> 01:37:05,970
in the world,
this material out there,

2309
01:37:05,971 --> 01:37:07,490
you just describe it.
It's out there.

2310
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:08,683
Yeah.
There's always something fucked up 

2311
01:37:09,471 --> 01:37:09,980
going.
Right.

2312
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:12,560
Especially today and then in your life 
there's stuff going on.

2313
01:37:12,561 --> 01:37:13,101
You're like,
okay,

2314
01:37:13,101 --> 01:37:13,934
got gotta.
Put that down.

2315
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,910
I mean this is one of the strangest 
times I think ever to be a comedian.

2316
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,010
Ooh,
where do I begin?

2317
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,160
That's great.
That's a great intro.

2318
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:25,310
Like,
fuck,

2319
01:37:25,311 --> 01:37:28,040
what do I start?
What do I do?

2320
01:37:28,041 --> 01:37:30,050
Where do I get?
The whole thing's a mess,

2321
01:37:30,051 --> 01:37:32,300
man.
We're buddying up with dictators,

2322
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:33,793
knows what's happening.
We've got a TV star for a president and 

2323
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:38,960
he's actually.
The economy is doing well,

2324
01:37:38,961 --> 01:37:41,900
so no one knows what to say.
The whole thing is chaos.

2325
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,180
First Lady was in playboy,
taught us,

2326
01:37:46,330 --> 01:37:47,163
lady was in playboy.
She is the very first hot as fuck first 

2327
01:37:49,701 --> 01:37:50,534
lady,

2328
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:52,290
right?
No doubt.

2329
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:54,280
Well,
we haven't seen all the first lady,

2330
01:37:54,281 --> 01:37:55,530
so that's true.

2331
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:59,590
She's the very first hot as fuck.
First lady was.

2332
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:03,120
She was stylish,
stylish,

2333
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:06,030
wasn't she shut down.
She was okay.

2334
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:08,400
She was okay.
If melania walked in the room,

2335
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:09,770
you start talking to Jackie.
No risk,

2336
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:12,330
no disrespect,
no disrespect.

2337
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:14,850
She was a beautiful lady.
She certainly was.

2338
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:16,020
She was.
I'm sure,

2339
01:38:16,021 --> 01:38:18,480
wonderful woman,
but Melania is stunning.

2340
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,430
She's like supermodel stunning.
Yeah.

2341
01:38:20,431 --> 01:38:22,300
Especially when she was younger.
She's stunning.

2342
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:24,930
Do you ever see pictures of her young 
Melania?

2343
01:38:24,931 --> 01:38:25,740
No.
Dude,

2344
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:26,573
when?
When he first married and she's a 

2345
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:28,890
beautiful woman,
like undeniably.

2346
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:32,350
Well,
you don't have to agree with him because

2347
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,140
he's.
I see some attraction there,

2348
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:35,160
but I don't know.
She's like,

2349
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,280
Holy Shit.
I think view around her in a party.

2350
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:41,660
And you both had a couple of cocktails.
Oh,

2351
01:38:41,661 --> 01:38:43,680
it might go down and she touched your 
thigh.

2352
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:46,050
Looked at you.
You'd be like,

2353
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:46,943
Oh shit.
I just got light headed to her or we 

2354
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:52,943
pull it up.
Picked you up.

2355
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:53,820
What are we doing?
What are you doing,

2356
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:55,673
Jamie?

2357
01:38:58,530 --> 01:38:59,800
Playboy picks.
You know it.

2358
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,440
Just just,
just take a.

2359
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:04,430
just show a photo of Melania,
right?

2360
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,630
Why can't we see the playbook?
Here we go.

2361
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:07,860
Come on.
Oh,

2362
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,510
that's not bad.
She's hot as fuck.

2363
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:11,520
That's not that one on the left is not 
bad.

2364
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:13,380
Yeah.
That's her when she was younger,

2365
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:15,160
but not much younger.
I mean,

2366
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:16,980
I think it's just how she's wearing what
she's wearing.

2367
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:17,963
She's dressed more conservative now.
If you look at her in the far right 

2368
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:20,690
pick,
you know,

2369
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:22,170
she's more conservatively.
That's not bad.

2370
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,660
That's not bad.
There's not even a close second.

2371
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:25,933
She knocked it out of the park.
That's a legitimate professional hot 

2372
01:39:29,461 --> 01:39:31,080
chick.
Who's the first lady?

2373
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:32,190
First Hour,
right?

2374
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:36,270
Save your bickering.
Stopped this.

2375
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:38,490
Michelle Obama was gorgeous.
That's true.

2376
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:39,960
But a different way.
A different way.

2377
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,370
What's this?
This is her.

2378
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:42,640
This is her.
When she was younger.

2379
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:44,790
That was definitely a different.
Gorgeous.

2380
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,620
This is a different thing,
so I'm looking at that body.

2381
01:39:46,621 --> 01:39:48,820
Sit on the couch.
Get the fuck out of dodge.

2382
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:51,270
Alright,
you got it.

2383
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,103
You got that.
It's like the beginning of that door 

2384
01:39:53,241 --> 01:39:56,370
song coming.
Come on.

2385
01:39:56,940 --> 01:39:58,160
That was nice.
That's whew.

2386
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,020
That is a top of the food chain right 
there.

2387
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:01,913
Apparently she isn't into looks as much.
Maybe she just likes the way he treats 

2388
01:40:06,361 --> 01:40:09,870
her go.
It's a strange,

2389
01:40:09,871 --> 01:40:11,310
strange time.
Tony Rock,

2390
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:13,070
you know,
strange.

2391
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,580
I love being a human being.
As a comic.

2392
01:40:14,581 --> 01:40:15,510
You got to love it.
Like you said.

2393
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:19,200
Um,
do you like living around here?

2394
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:20,760
Uh,
you know what?

2395
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:23,490
I like La.
I don't love it.

2396
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:24,930
It's not like,
oh my God,

2397
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:26,660
I'm such a New Yorker.
I just,

2398
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:27,503
I'm used to that.
How long have you been living down here 

2399
01:40:29,041 --> 01:40:31,290
now?
Ten years.

2400
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:32,070
Ten years?
Yeah,

2401
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:34,140
but like the first three I was,
I would go home every.

2402
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:35,820
You,
I was here filming a TV show,

2403
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:36,654
so every height this week I would go 
home and when the show wrapped I would 

2404
01:40:39,751 --> 01:40:41,550
go on tour.
So I wasn't here the whole time.

2405
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,190
The people who like New York,
especially New York comics,

2406
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:47,340
they say that New York comics,
it's more harsh.

2407
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:50,190
Like it's more fun,
like people insult each other more.

2408
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:52,260
Yeah.
There's like a,

2409
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:55,480
there's a comradery to that.
That's way more comradery.

2410
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:58,900
Way More.
I come to la,

2411
01:40:58,901 --> 01:40:59,351
it's like,
oh,

2412
01:40:59,351 --> 01:41:00,184
I didn't know we were enemies.
I didn't know we were all against each 

2413
01:41:01,301 --> 01:41:02,800
other.
How do you feel that?

2414
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,890
Yeah.
Really more so with black comics.

2415
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:08,400
Oh,
more so black comics of course,

2416
01:41:08,401 --> 01:41:09,234
like,
you know,

2417
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:11,130
that's unfortunate.
I got to.

2418
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:14,110
Unfortunately I have the brother that 
everybody's like,

2419
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:15,140
you know,
he said,

2420
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:16,570
oh,
he's the best and all this his brother.

2421
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,433
Fuck that guy.
This guy's regarded as the best and 

2422
01:41:20,731 --> 01:41:22,510
that's his brother.
Fuck him.

2423
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:25,570
He's going to get passed along.
He doesn't have to work hard,

2424
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,070
but you to have everything handed to 
him.

2425
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:27,913
That didn't happen with the Wayans 
brothers like Keenan and Marlin or a 

2426
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:34,840
demon rather.
Why do you think that is?

2427
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,410
I don't know.
Like they did stuff together.

2428
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:41,840
Keenan,
ivory Wayans and Damon waynes.

2429
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:43,123
Like when they were both.
They were both famous of the exact same 

2430
01:41:44,481 --> 01:41:45,314
time.
Yeah.

2431
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:48,560
People forget how funny.
Daymond was.

2432
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:51,020
A monster still monster.
Still.

2433
01:41:51,170 --> 01:41:53,270
Most when I used to see him in the 
nineties,

2434
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:57,790
he had a last his last stand up,
I think he called it a three.

2435
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:59,750
The last day.
He was like,

2436
01:41:59,751 --> 01:42:00,920
I'm done.
I'm never doing this again.

2437
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:03,470
That shit is one of my all time favorite
specials.

2438
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,060
Didn't grab,
grab,

2439
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:11,630
grab a quick bite.
You hilarious.

2440
01:42:12,110 --> 01:42:14,690
Tommy hearns piece.
He is so funny,

2441
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:15,553
my brother said,
uh,

2442
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:16,673
uh,
Dave and told him a lot about how to 

2443
01:42:17,691 --> 01:42:18,321
stand up.
Oh,

2444
01:42:18,321 --> 01:42:19,350
I'm sure.
Yeah,

2445
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:22,310
it was,
it still the man he was,

2446
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:23,263
he was a guy who would come in.
I'm do late night spots of the comedy 

2447
01:42:26,151 --> 01:42:28,640
store.
He would just show up and you know,

2448
01:42:28,641 --> 01:42:29,474
they'd put them up whenever he got there
and he would just completely explore 

2449
01:42:33,081 --> 01:42:38,081
ideas like he had no worry about,
like he wasn't concerned about getting a

2450
01:42:38,301 --> 01:42:38,990
laugh.

2451
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:42,560
He was working it out on stage 100 
percent have seen it.

2452
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:46,070
He was a famous guy at the time.
This is after in living color.

2453
01:42:46,071 --> 01:42:48,290
I see dave do it all the time.
Whenever I see David's stage,

2454
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,240
David's like,
fuck this room.

2455
01:42:50,241 --> 01:42:52,340
I'm trying to figure this shit out for 
the show,

2456
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:53,693
you know,
but you also want to entertain the room 

2457
01:42:54,741 --> 01:42:56,310
because they are the show too.
Right.

2458
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:58,190
So Dave is,
I think,

2459
01:42:58,191 --> 01:42:59,024
the best dancing through that line.
He knows how to create new material 

2460
01:43:01,761 --> 01:43:03,290
better than I think anybody I've ever 
seen.

2461
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:05,430
Have you seen Mark Curry?
Yo,

2462
01:43:05,431 --> 01:43:06,264
yeah.
Mark will go on stage and say give me a 

2463
01:43:09,231 --> 01:43:11,720
topic and make it a 10 minute bit.
Yeah.

2464
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,460
Yeah,
and that shit is impressive.

2465
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:17,690
He's such a nice guy.
I think he is so likable.

2466
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,210
Like Mark Curry,
like one of the nicest fucking guys.

2467
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:21,650
Like when he would come to the comedy 
store,

2468
01:43:21,651 --> 01:43:22,520
everybody would light up.

2469
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:25,940
It was just so nice.
Like always funny to do it.

2470
01:43:25,941 --> 01:43:27,830
I like real relax like him a lot.
Man.

2471
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:31,090
Y'all see I saw him do a lot of sets 
back then too.

2472
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:32,750
Back when he was doing,
hanging with Mr Cooper.

2473
01:43:32,751 --> 01:43:35,900
He drop in and do that.
I haven't seen him in a long time.

2474
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:38,570
I think he was on tour with a cat right 
there.

2475
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:42,050
He's got a sleeper Bronco.
I think he still has it.

2476
01:43:42,410 --> 01:43:47,060
We had this like 19 eighties black 
Bronco,

2477
01:43:47,061 --> 01:43:49,430
but he had it all done up like Oj Bronco
and was like,

2478
01:43:49,431 --> 01:43:51,560
oh Jane Bronco.
But he a.

2479
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:55,970
He had like a engine upgrade in it.
Suspension,

2480
01:43:55,971 --> 01:43:57,440
upgrade tires,
wheels,

2481
01:43:57,441 --> 01:44:00,620
the whole deal.
It was like an urban assault vehicle,

2482
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,290
like a powerful Bronco that like.
It just looked like an older bronco.

2483
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:05,960
Let somebody just has on the road,
but meanwhile this thing,

2484
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:07,820
it's like tuned up.
Nice.

2485
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:09,140
Yeah.
The classics man.

2486
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:10,820
Yeah,
and he would drive around that thing.

2487
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:13,160
He had a gang of cars.
I love cars.

2488
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:15,500
Really Nice.
Funny Guy.

2489
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:16,573
I gotta.
I gotta.

2490
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:18,470
I gotta get some old schools.
I want to.

2491
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,150
I want to train them.
That's what I was.

2492
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:20,730
Ooh,
what?

2493
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:22,050
The smokey and the bandit.
Trans and.

2494
01:44:22,051 --> 01:44:23,330
Yeah,
that's what I would.

2495
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:25,370
What is this?
Oh,

2496
01:44:25,371 --> 01:44:26,510
that's right.
It died.

2497
01:44:26,511 --> 01:44:28,850
He got hit by a tree.
Fuck,

2498
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:30,950
that's right.
Did he catch on fire?

2499
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,920
No,
a man.

2500
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:35,930
But that's the Bronco.
Yeah.

2501
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:36,973
Damn.
The storm last year took mark curry's 

2502
01:44:40,491 --> 01:44:41,324
Bronco.

2503
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:42,680
He loved that thing,
man.

2504
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:45,020
That was it.
It was a total sleeper.

2505
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:49,220
That car was a sleeper.
Three smart dudes like him.

2506
01:44:49,221 --> 01:44:50,210
Man.
They good sleepers.

2507
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:52,640
They like to drive around a no notice 
car.

2508
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:56,240
You gotta around like that to don't 
bring too much attention.

2509
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:57,083
Yeah.
You got to move around and go wherever 

2510
01:44:57,891 --> 01:44:59,210
you want to go.
When you want to go,

2511
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,340
you know,
that's a movement and no nonsense.

2512
01:45:01,341 --> 01:45:03,770
Bronco.
I need an old school.

2513
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:06,050
What kind of A.
I liked the,

2514
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:09,920
I liked the pickup trucks,
the old thirties or forties,

2515
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,720
fifties.
The Chevy with the uh,

2516
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:13,010
with the.
Like the bubble.

2517
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:15,850
Oh yeah.
A tire covers what it was like.

2518
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:16,671
Oh,
I don't know.

2519
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:20,240
But I know what you're talking about.
There's one that a lot of people redo.

2520
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:23,930
There's a very specific,
a chevy pickup truck that right there.

2521
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:25,750
Oh,
I need that.

2522
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:30,230
I need one of those 1950 chevy pickup.
Wow.

2523
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,140
It's crazy what they can do to those 
two.

2524
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,330
I mean,
who would have ever saw if you looked at

2525
01:45:35,331 --> 01:45:36,164
one of those in the flesh in 1950 that 
someone would have something like that 

2526
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:40,063
in 2018.
That looks like something from the 

2527
01:45:41,721 --> 01:45:42,950
movie.
Fifty eight cars.

2528
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:46,820
It costs $6,000 in 1950.
Did it even cost that much?

2529
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:48,673
Let's guess.
How much did the pickup truck costs in 

2530
01:45:50,931 --> 01:45:53,000
1950?
I say $1,500.

2531
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:56,940
I'm going to say $3,500.
How much did it pickup?

2532
01:45:56,990 --> 01:46:00,200
Cost in 1950.
Here we go.

2533
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:01,400
Drum roll please.

2534
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:13,420
Nothing popped up off the top.
That gives me pricing for now too.

2535
01:46:13,881 --> 01:46:15,020
So I'm trying to.
Oh,

2536
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:17,750
how did you write?
How much did it pickup?

2537
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:22,770
Truck costs of in retail price in 1950.
Maybe that's it.

2538
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:30,200
People listening to this support out of 
their fucking mind right now.

2539
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,400
Like,
do you really care?

2540
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:33,320
Why?
Do you care what a pickup truck cost?

2541
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:36,620
Nineteen 50 or they watch it live.
Some people.

2542
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:38,510
Hey,
what's up people?

2543
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:41,150
There's a slight delay.
Nice.

2544
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:42,330
Oh,
for curses.

2545
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,500
Because the Internet,
I think it's too late.

2546
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,940
We already fucked it up.
How much do they cost?

2547
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:47,840
12.
40 three.

2548
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,120
1,200?
Yeah.

2549
01:46:49,190 --> 01:46:50,970
Twelve 43.
12.

2550
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:52,320
Forty three.
One thousand.

2551
01:46:52,321 --> 01:46:54,270
Two hundred $43.
That's crazy.

2552
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:57,040
Insane.
I tell current value of $30,000.

2553
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,740
Nice or so?
Yeah.

2554
01:46:58,741 --> 01:47:00,780
I gotta get one.
That's what you want.

2555
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:02,340
Why a pickup truck?
Not a muscle car.

2556
01:47:02,690 --> 01:47:03,281
No,
I wouldn't.

2557
01:47:03,281 --> 01:47:05,080
I want that.
I want that to hold that spoon.

2558
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:08,520
We debated at first.
Oh yeah,

2559
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:09,301
of course.
I wanted to.

2560
01:47:09,301 --> 01:47:12,750
Lincoln continental with the suicide.
Doors need that.

2561
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:13,920
Wow.
Got To have that.

2562
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:15,133
The smokey and the bandit.
You're gonna have the firebird on the 

2563
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:17,334
front end.
The Hood?

2564
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:19,290
Yeah.
The same one I went to,

2565
01:47:19,291 --> 01:47:20,220
uh,
I want to

2566
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:23,850
the Ford Mustang.
The Illinois.

2567
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:25,560
Yes.
Yes.

2568
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:26,423
The in 60 seconds car than that.
That's one of the best looking cars of 

2569
01:47:29,791 --> 01:47:31,100
all time.
Probably the.

2570
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:33,570
Yeah,
probably the 66 corvette.

2571
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:35,070
Beautiful car.
Those are great.

2572
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:37,110
Gardasil car.
I have a [inaudible] 65 convertible.

2573
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:39,220
Do you really love so you know.
Yeah,

2574
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,830
they're great.
Beautiful piece of machinery.

2575
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,230
It's crazy.
Look right there.

2576
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,233
Look back.
The top comes off like you just did 

2577
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:45,623
right there.
That's one of the most beautiful cars 

2578
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:49,710
ever made.
Is that a 67,

2579
01:47:49,711 --> 01:47:50,610
jamie?
That's what it says.

2580
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:53,490
God,
that is incredible.

2581
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:54,353
Is it called Eleanor before that movie 
or that come from it came from the 

2582
01:47:56,581 --> 01:47:57,061
movie,
right?

2583
01:47:57,061 --> 01:47:57,871
Yeah.
No,

2584
01:47:57,871 --> 01:48:00,390
I think it means something.
I think eleanor,

2585
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:05,420
when you say it backwards,
like whatever the acronym is,

2586
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,363
the,
uh,

2587
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,680
find it.
It's the.

2588
01:48:10,190 --> 01:48:11,023
I think that's what they did.
I think they took some kind of tuner 

2589
01:48:12,991 --> 01:48:13,824
thing,
some someone's name and used it 

2590
01:48:15,721 --> 01:48:17,550
backwards.
It's like Roanoke,

2591
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:21,013
is that it?
I remember very vaguely the story how 

2592
01:48:24,181 --> 01:48:28,450
they came up with the name eleanor.
Anyway,

2593
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:30,470
see if you can find it.
Yeah,

2594
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:31,670
definitely need that.
Yeah,

2595
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:35,090
that right there to dope fucking car.
Super Dope.

2596
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:36,483
Maybe I'm thinking the opposite.
Maybe what I'm thinking of is someone 

2597
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:43,960
made a car that's like eleanor,
but they spelled it backwards.

2598
01:48:44,530 --> 01:48:47,860
I think that might be it.
It just says eleanor is the only forward

2599
01:48:47,861 --> 01:48:48,694
one,
mach one in history to see if a car 

2600
01:48:49,721 --> 01:48:50,554
title credit.
Take the word eleanor and spell it 

2601
01:48:53,531 --> 01:48:54,364
backwards and Google that.
I think there's a car that they're 

2602
01:48:56,441 --> 01:48:58,990
making where they spell eleanor 
backwards.

2603
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:01,270
I think this is where I'm getting at the
Hyundai rule of the age.

2604
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,090
The new Hyundai.
Yeah.

2605
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:09,100
What would be eleanor?
Two thousand five Ranell Mustang.

2606
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:10,330
Oh,
see there it is.

2607
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:12,070
Yeah,
that's what it is.

2608
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:14,470
That's where I fucked up.
Yeah,

2609
01:49:14,471 --> 01:49:19,471
so there's a mustang that they were.
There were spelling eleanor backwards to

2610
01:49:19,541 --> 01:49:21,430
make a dope Mustang.
Oh,

2611
01:49:21,431 --> 01:49:22,630
okay.
Okay.

2612
01:49:22,660 --> 01:49:23,570
Not Bad.
Yeah,

2613
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:26,380
not bad for a modern car for fun.
That's nice.

2614
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:31,890
Those are like modern muscle cars.
Those cars like that year,

2615
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:37,540
like a into the 2000,
15 and 16 is when they kept the.

2616
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:40,720
They got rid of the live rear axle 
somewhere around,

2617
01:49:43,190 --> 01:49:47,200
I want to say like pretty recently,
like 2012 or something like that.

2618
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:48,030
When,
when was the,

2619
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:48,863
the,
the latest Mustang released the latest 

2620
01:49:51,551 --> 01:49:52,384
model Mustang.
Before that they used to have a solid 

2621
01:49:54,311 --> 01:49:55,900
rear axle,
like a muscle car.

2622
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:57,250
Right.
So it can handle terrible,

2623
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:59,540
but it's.
But it was fun to go,

2624
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,960
but you would stomp on the gas and 
things would go sideways.

2625
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:02,794
It would burn out everywhere.
It was really like having a modern 

2626
01:50:05,411 --> 01:50:06,244
muscle car with like antilock brakes and
a stick shift and you buy it from the 

2627
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:13,000
factory with 550 horsepower.
Ridiculous car.

2628
01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:16,150
Then they got it all the way up to 700.
And the last models,

2629
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:19,240
the last models of the GT,
500 or 700 horsepower.

2630
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:21,200
Front wheel rear wheel drive.
Wow.

2631
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:24,640
Wow.
700 horsepower with a rear axle.

2632
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,170
That's insane.
Yeah.

2633
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:28,870
Big crazy rear axle bouncing all over 
every.

2634
01:50:28,871 --> 01:50:30,990
Every pothole.
You hit the cargo sideways.

2635
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:35,350
I don't,
but they apparently.

2636
01:50:35,351 --> 01:50:37,960
That's great though.
Those old school,

2637
01:50:37,961 --> 01:50:38,794
he muscle cars for grip and the ground.
There's something about having 

2638
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:44,650
everything all in one heel in the office
a little bit back.

2639
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:49,950
Just those two black stripes on the 
asphalt as it goes sideways.

2640
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:51,010
I love it.
I love it.

2641
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:52,060
Dance.
What'd you say?

2642
01:50:52,061 --> 01:50:54,190
You have a 60,
65 core Corbett?

2643
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,270
Yeah.
That's nice.

2644
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,520
I love it.
It's an old rumble,

2645
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:58,543
I believe from what I just read that 
that car was only made made for maybe 

2646
01:51:02,691 --> 01:51:05,000
even used in that original movie and the
guy that made it,

2647
01:51:05,001 --> 01:51:07,700
hb toby,
holyoake wrote,

2648
01:51:07,701 --> 01:51:09,320
starred and directed that movie.

2649
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:11,430
No,
that's his car.

2650
01:51:11,431 --> 01:51:12,264
So,
but I think they made several versions 

2651
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:17,100
because I saw a video of them selling 
one of them.

2652
01:51:17,101 --> 01:51:19,160
They're selling one of them online.
Yeah,

2653
01:51:19,170 --> 01:51:22,860
but there's a company called classic 
recreation's.

2654
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,080
They.
They make those now they'll.

2655
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:27,510
They'll make you so you can get a frame.
No,

2656
01:51:27,570 --> 01:51:28,403
they do the whole thing from the 
beginning out and they make you like a 

2657
01:51:30,751 --> 01:51:33,720
brand new version of a 19,
67 mustang.

2658
01:51:33,721 --> 01:51:36,630
But with modern engine modern 
suspension,

2659
01:51:37,150 --> 01:51:41,920
which is expensive as I could have,
I could have added.

2660
01:51:43,950 --> 01:51:46,800
But if you're some rich dude who just 
you lucas,

2661
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,380
one is the thing about this like 
flossing,

2662
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:50,850
right?
Like if you have a Lamborghini,

2663
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:52,560
you like,
look at this guy's doors go up,

2664
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:54,090
you know,
there's something about that,

2665
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,770
right?
The lamborghini was made for philosophy.

2666
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,330
Ferrari.
Same thing.

2667
01:51:57,331 --> 01:52:01,220
You pull up one on like look at this 
motherfucker making it woo.

2668
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,260
But if you pull up in one of those 
things,

2669
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:07,230
that's,
that's a different kind of enjoyment.

2670
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:09,540
That's like you're driving around in a 
art piece.

2671
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:10,560
Exactly.
You know,

2672
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:12,480
you.
That's the less attention.

2673
01:52:12,481 --> 01:52:15,050
Grab a storyteller that's,
that's like,

2674
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:17,430
people are just going to stop you.
Yeah.

2675
01:52:17,431 --> 01:52:20,970
It's like an a plus in terms of the 
impact it has on,

2676
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:24,510
on guys in particularly.
Put girls don't care about that as much.

2677
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:27,510
Like think a muscle car.
I think chicks would dig that one.

2678
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,920
I think that one.
That one's so.

2679
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:30,630
Dig The long ball,
man.

2680
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:35,810
You thought that's the logo that is,
that's out of the house.

2681
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:37,770
Like what is that like?
Hey,

2682
01:52:37,771 --> 01:52:39,030
come take a it.
Yeah,

2683
01:52:39,031 --> 01:52:40,860
pull up.
Pull that photo up again.

2684
01:52:40,861 --> 01:52:41,694
That's silver one.
That 1967 silver one that you just had 

2685
01:52:43,981 --> 01:52:44,814
up.

2686
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,870
Look at this again.
She's looking at you.

2687
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:50,870
You pull that up in front of the club.
Yeah,

2688
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,490
Jesus Christ.
That's pretty.

2689
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:54,770
Do you know how much the one from the 
movie sold for at auction?

2690
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,760
Let me guess.
The one from the $700,000.

2691
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:00,530
$4 million.
1 million.

2692
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:02,010
Wow.
Wow.

2693
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:05,150
What the main one from John Wick or from
Al Ghanim?

2694
01:53:05,151 --> 01:53:08,210
Sixty seconds in John Wick.
That's what it was.

2695
01:53:08,211 --> 01:53:10,220
It wasn't the eleanor one.
I'm remembering wrong.

2696
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:11,083
It was the.
They were selling one of the mustangs 

2697
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:16,460
and the movie John Wick.
He had a 69.

2698
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:18,070
He had a.
It wasn't a Illinois,

2699
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,370
but if he had a nice moment in the 
movie,

2700
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:21,560
right?
Hit a 69 that got stolen.

2701
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,030
Got killed his dog and stole stolen car 
and then he got a 70 Chevelle shipped.

2702
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,133
That's another.
Everybody that's 70 shows that 70 

2703
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:33,440
Chevelles class.
That's a good one.

2704
01:53:33,441 --> 01:53:36,020
That's an impala.
I got to get an impala to Anita.

2705
01:53:36,790 --> 01:53:39,020
You know what's even more classic than 
will look at that.

2706
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:40,960
God Damn Man.
That's a [inaudible].

2707
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:43,010
Sixty nine.
I think that's a mock one.

2708
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:44,600
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

2709
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:46,860
Look at that time.
Uh,

2710
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:50,270
it makes me faintest fucking pretty weak
in the legs and I see a car like that.

2711
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,500
Like,
oh my goodness.

2712
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:53,570
Look at that thing.
That is America.

2713
01:53:53,571 --> 01:53:56,780
It's like two pieces that I think it's 
like the front.

2714
01:53:58,190 --> 01:54:00,320
Yeah.
They do not drive that good.

2715
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:02,390
They do not because that looks pretty 
stock.

2716
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:05,300
They do not handle very well.
Nope.

2717
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,620
Terrible.
It's another kind of.

2718
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:08,990
Yeah.
If you had like a modern Honda accord,

2719
01:54:08,991 --> 01:54:12,080
you'll blow that thing off the road for 
real.

2720
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,960
You've written that's Goddamn Work of 
art though.

2721
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:17,030
Pull up in that thing.
You take the Honda accord.

2722
01:54:17,031 --> 01:54:18,500
I'll take that.
Look at that.

2723
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:19,933
Look how pretty that is.
That might be one of the best looking 

2724
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:23,900
cars of all time.

2725
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:26,390
Know that eleanor is.
Yeah.

2726
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,313
Top three.
Go to that one in the upper right hand 

2727
01:54:28,791 --> 01:54:29,660
corner.
Young Jamie.

2728
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:34,010
Look at that fucking thing.
S 1969.

2729
01:54:34,011 --> 01:54:39,011
Mach one dude Hendricks who was alive 
that his car was out.

2730
01:54:40,671 --> 01:54:43,210
That is a sexy vehicle right there.
Hendrix died in [inaudible].

2731
01:54:43,211 --> 01:54:44,044
Sixty nine.
Right?

2732
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:45,343
You could,
you could have been on your way to a 

2733
01:54:46,431 --> 01:54:49,490
Goddamn Hendrix concert in that car in 
1969.

2734
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:50,743
You would be.
The man can imagine you pick up your 

2735
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:56,000
girl Shit,
Hendrix concert net people,

2736
01:54:56,030 --> 01:54:57,920
you know.
People were just different than.

2737
01:54:58,650 --> 01:54:59,121
Nice.
Yeah.

2738
01:54:59,121 --> 01:55:00,560
Hendrix probably would pull up the 
concert.

2739
01:55:00,561 --> 01:55:01,940
That right.
That'd be a car.

2740
01:55:01,941 --> 01:55:04,460
Hendrix or drive.
Kevin's a guitar in the passenger seat.

2741
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:05,800
Yeah.
I found out there was a house.

2742
01:55:05,801 --> 01:55:08,150
It was for sale that Hendrix almost 
bought.

2743
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:13,570
I live in Topanga Canyon and I was like,
you don't count the count.

2744
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:16,580
He just walk through it like,
Nah,

2745
01:55:16,581 --> 01:55:17,120
not this one.

2746
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:19,460
He was apparently on his way to buying 
it when he died.

2747
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:21,330
What is this thing?
Right?

2748
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:25,850
T top Sun damage.
That's Jimi Hendrix corvette.

2749
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:27,133
Holy Shit.
See if you find any other pictures of 

2750
01:55:28,821 --> 01:55:30,210
that thing.
That's.

2751
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,090
That's the sexy car.
Should look like a shock.

2752
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:36,330
God.
Jimmy Hendrix had a baby last night.

2753
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:38,750
That's just a different one,
but yeah,

2754
01:55:38,751 --> 01:55:40,940
those are crazy looking.
Go to that other one.

2755
01:55:40,941 --> 01:55:44,280
That was just on that.
That this isn't right here.

2756
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:45,151
That's.
So.

2757
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:48,570
There's only a couple of pictures of the
car from the top two corvettes.

2758
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:50,970
Damn.
He had two corvettes.

2759
01:55:51,380 --> 01:55:53,550
Are those both is back to back?
Is that what we're looking at?

2760
01:55:53,551 --> 01:55:54,930
Two different ones.
It's the same car.

2761
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:55,913
Oh yeah.
Jimmy Hendrix knew how to live old 

2762
01:56:01,321 --> 01:56:03,480
school man.
Dinosaur.

2763
01:56:03,481 --> 01:56:04,680
Beautiful.
Beautiful car.

2764
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:06,930
Yeah.
What do you drive,

2765
01:56:06,931 --> 01:56:08,040
Tony?
I have a cadillac.

2766
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:09,360
Ooh,
I like it.

2767
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:11,640
I like it.
I got a catalog.

2768
01:56:11,650 --> 01:56:13,410
Which one do you got?
I got the sts.

2769
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:14,313
Is is old now.
I was actually going to buy a new car 

2770
01:56:15,481 --> 01:56:17,790
like the next couple of months.
Kind of what?

2771
01:56:17,791 --> 01:56:20,010
I want to have a crazy new sedan coming 
out.

2772
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,230
Which ones?
Some something v,

2773
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:24,990
some big four door.
Super powered.

2774
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:27,450
Ultra comfortable waiting for.
Have you seen the El Mirage?

2775
01:56:27,451 --> 01:56:29,010
Can you pull up the Cadillac?
El Mirage,

2776
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:33,660
Mirage e l m I r a J.
I've been waiting for years for this car

2777
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,820
and every time I go to the auto show 
they're like,

2778
01:56:35,821 --> 01:56:36,660
yeah,
it's coming next year.

2779
01:56:36,661 --> 01:56:37,530
So I wait,
wait,

2780
01:56:37,531 --> 01:56:39,150
wait.
That sounds like a superhero.

2781
01:56:39,151 --> 01:56:42,350
And a Robert Rodriguez movie.
The MRI Mirage.

2782
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,870
Look at this motherfucker.
Woo,

2783
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,630
four years Cadillac.
I've been waiting for this call.

2784
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:51,300
Whoa.
Every auto show.

2785
01:56:51,301 --> 01:56:52,134
Yeah,
next year.

2786
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:54,060
That is slick.
That's a two door.

2787
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:55,560
Yes.
Holy Shit.

2788
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:58,470
I've been waiting patiently for this 
car.

2789
01:56:58,530 --> 01:56:59,363
You know,
when we were kids we thought about what 

2790
01:57:01,501 --> 01:57:02,820
cars will look like in the future.

2791
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:04,470
That's what they would look like in the 
future.

2792
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:06,540
Look at the front end of that thing,
like the headlights.

2793
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:08,730
Those are crazy.
Look at that man.

2794
01:57:09,810 --> 01:57:10,643
That has such a futuristic,
like pause there for that picture and 

2795
01:57:13,681 --> 01:57:14,514
make that a little bit bigger.
That has such a futuristic shaped to 

2796
01:57:17,791 --> 01:57:20,640
look at the leather on the inside and 
look at that grill.

2797
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:23,060
Look on that.
Grill integrates with like,

2798
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,080
this is how girls go with shoes.
Like,

2799
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:28,170
oh my God.
Do you see how strappy they are?

2800
01:57:28,171 --> 01:57:29,640
And you say to your girl like,
I don't get it.

2801
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,670
This is it right here.
You're not going to get it.

2802
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:34,140
This.
It's so strappy.

2803
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:39,060
For years I been waiting for this call.
Why are you such a Cadillac Dude?

2804
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:42,330
My father drove a cadillac.
It's a tribute to my dad.

2805
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:43,533
I like that last call.
My pops had before he passed away was a 

2806
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:46,493
Burgundy Cadillac and he,
I just remember he loved it so much and 

2807
01:57:49,531 --> 01:57:51,240
I didn't know growing up growing up in 
New York,

2808
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:52,074
I didn't need a car.

2809
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:53,850
When I moved to La I was like,
Oh shit,

2810
01:57:53,851 --> 01:57:55,230
I got to get a car to get around.
I'm like,

2811
01:57:55,231 --> 01:57:57,960
what am I going to get tribute to Dad 
Cadillac.

2812
01:57:58,110 --> 01:58:00,540
I love it.
That's a good move.

2813
01:58:00,610 --> 01:58:01,443
Yeah.
They make some old school cars too that 

2814
01:58:03,901 --> 01:58:07,200
you could actually get fixed up and 
drive around some seventies.

2815
01:58:07,230 --> 01:58:11,520
Some of them are going to get an Oldie 
and put it in the hands of the caretaker

2816
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:13,320
and let them just fix it up.
Get you one of them.

2817
01:58:13,321 --> 01:58:15,660
Definitely gonna do that.
Two Door Eldorados.

2818
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:18,420
Who?
What color?

2819
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:20,300
What color?
I don't know.

2820
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:23,670
Maybe like a money green.
Oh,

2821
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:24,570
like,
um,

2822
01:58:24,570 --> 01:58:25,403
like the Bishop Don Juan.
Do you have a migraine than scratch 

2823
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:28,790
that?
Scratch that.

2824
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:33,450
We'll go burgundy because I don't want 
anybody to mistake me for the.

2825
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:39,180
I don't want no girl running up and by 
calling in and out Burger,

2826
01:58:39,181 --> 01:58:41,680
like I got your money daddy.
I liked the burgundy,

2827
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:42,100
I like

2828
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:42,933
burgundy liquid,
like a little bit of metallic flake to 

2829
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:46,090
it.
Oh yeah.

2830
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:48,440
That would be nice.
That would make sense.

2831
01:58:48,450 --> 01:58:49,283
Yes.
All fresh chrome got to ride those 

2832
01:58:52,481 --> 01:58:53,260
things,
man.

2833
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:54,093
I mean you got to respect the fact that 
it takes a long time to stop those 

2834
01:58:56,471 --> 01:58:58,230
fuckers.
Convertible Eldorado.

2835
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:02,890
Oh,
look at this.

2836
01:59:02,891 --> 01:59:07,270
We're looking at a 76 convertible 
Eldorado oh my God.

2837
01:59:07,271 --> 01:59:08,380
What a shape.
Look at that.

2838
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:11,410
What a shape that was back when they 
didn't know what the fuck.

2839
01:59:11,411 --> 01:59:13,940
Aerodynamics was like.
What the old.

2840
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:15,460
That's what we're talking about right 
there.

2841
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:16,960
Look at that thing.
Look at that.

2842
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:19,410
What years that Jim?
Sixty seven.

2843
01:59:19,411 --> 01:59:20,460
Yeah.
God.

2844
01:59:21,610 --> 01:59:23,950
That's nice.
People just drove these enormous boats.

2845
01:59:23,951 --> 01:59:27,820
Look at the size of the trunk.
It's crazy.

2846
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,310
That trunk couldn't fit like a smart 
card.

2847
01:59:30,370 --> 01:59:32,380
Yeah.
You could easily sleep in that trunk.

2848
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:34,930
No problem.
That's nice.

2849
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:36,573
They just went through a period of time 
where they were making these giant 

2850
01:59:38,531 --> 01:59:40,690
boats,
like the suicide door.

2851
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:43,260
Continental.
You talked about that time closet.

2852
01:59:43,261 --> 01:59:45,940
Yeah.
All time classic.

2853
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:47,890
Got To love that.
Yeah.

2854
01:59:47,891 --> 01:59:49,690
That's another one.
Best call probably ever made,

2855
01:59:49,930 --> 01:59:50,763
you know,
it's another best car ever made that it 

2856
01:59:51,521 --> 01:59:54,460
would never want to park anywhere.
Nineteen 68 charger.

2857
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:57,550
I saw in 1968 charger all done up.
Dukes of hazard.

2858
01:59:58,270 --> 02:00:01,030
It's similar is that is that year 68 or 
69?

2859
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:03,490
One of those years.
He's one of those years.

2860
02:00:03,491 --> 02:00:05,290
His bad ass.
But those cars,

2861
02:00:05,291 --> 02:00:08,470
they were just like sharks,
like big long boats.

2862
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:11,440
They weren't like in any like look at 
that.

2863
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:14,890
That's not in any way practical in terms
of its shape.

2864
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:15,993
Like it's gotta be that winds got to go 
into that grill in a weird way and 

2865
02:00:18,821 --> 02:00:21,760
probably slows it down.
It's like having a little mini parachute

2866
02:00:21,761 --> 02:00:23,830
in front of your hood.
Obviously.

2867
02:00:23,831 --> 02:00:24,281
I don't know.
Shit.

2868
02:00:24,281 --> 02:00:26,330
I don't know about aerodynamic dynamics 
back then.

2869
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:31,360
Go back to that original picture,
man.

2870
02:00:31,361 --> 02:00:34,870
That original one was beautiful.
Look at that thing.

2871
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:35,763
That's what I'm talking about.
Like that car just represents a 

2872
02:00:37,271 --> 02:00:39,460
different world.
That's a fast and furious,

2873
02:00:39,461 --> 02:00:40,300
right?
Yeah.

2874
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:42,700
He had those right or similar.
Something similar.

2875
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:43,534
Similar years.
There's something about a in 1978 got 

2876
02:00:46,691 --> 02:00:49,630
weird because then they put the bumper 
all around the front,

2877
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:52,810
like a big oval.
Who See?

2878
02:00:52,811 --> 02:00:53,800
You ever see that?
No.

2879
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:56,620
This car pull up.
Nineteen 70 charger.

2880
02:00:56,650 --> 02:00:57,910
Nineteen 70.
Got Weird.

2881
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,880
Like somebody got crafty.
Look at the front bumper.

2882
02:01:00,910 --> 02:01:01,630
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2883
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:03,730
yeah.
What did you just do?

2884
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:05,230
Hey.
Hey.

2885
02:01:05,410 --> 02:01:07,540
Come here.
That's like put it back.

2886
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:08,350
Yeah.
What did you do?

2887
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:09,183
Put it back.
You had one go to the black one right 

2888
02:01:11,471 --> 02:01:12,760
above it.
Where the headlights.

2889
02:01:13,330 --> 02:01:14,163
Oh,
they roll up the roll up like a 69 

2890
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:17,800
Camaro.
You ever see a 69 community?

2891
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:19,640
Yeah.
It flips.

2892
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:20,890
Yeah.
Those things flip.

2893
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:24,460
That was like the rage back then man.
People love roll up headlights.

2894
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:26,493
That's a good picture jamie.
But the other ones better because you 

2895
02:01:27,761 --> 02:01:29,030
could see the uh,
no.

2896
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:32,050
The black one right next to it because 
you could see the other blue.

2897
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:33,670
Yeah.
That weren't there because you could see

2898
02:01:33,671 --> 02:01:35,440
the grill,
like make that a little bigger.

2899
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:38,770
Like look how goofy that is.
Look how goofy that grill is.

2900
02:01:38,771 --> 02:01:40,010
The bumper and the grill

2901
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,950
or like it's got a bumper and a down 
bumper.

2902
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:44,443
Like,
what are you doing?

2903
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:46,550
Why'd you do that?
Don't do that.

2904
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:48,020
You had it perfect.
You fuck.

2905
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:49,420
Some guy was like,
you know,

2906
02:01:49,421 --> 02:01:50,530
but yet Alex.
Oh yeah.

2907
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:52,850
Those people were on coke.
It was the seventies.

2908
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:53,983
They were like,
you know,

2909
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:55,850
fuck double bond.
Let's do it.

2910
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:56,780
Double bumper,
bumper up,

2911
02:01:56,781 --> 02:01:57,650
top bumper.
The bottom.

2912
02:01:57,651 --> 02:01:58,484
It's my thing,
bro.

2913
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:00,020
You're going to push that through to the
GM.

2914
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:00,891
A.
Hey,

2915
02:02:00,891 --> 02:02:03,580
did you bring up my idea about the 
double bumper on top?

2916
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:04,510
On the bottom.
I'm telling you,

2917
02:02:04,511 --> 02:02:05,450
man,
it's a fucking move.

2918
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:08,540
It's one that I look at that just 
doesn't look as good.

2919
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:10,220
It still looks bad ass.
It does.

2920
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:12,350
It's still.
The original picture was the one.

2921
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:14,270
Yeah.
Now go to a 1969.

2922
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:17,690
Nineteen 69 is a sweet spot.
That's when they nailed it and then they

2923
02:02:17,691 --> 02:02:20,710
fucked it up.
They should have made the 1969 charger.

2924
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:21,920
Ooh.
Yeah.

2925
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:23,960
See it wasn't.
That was dukes of hazzard.

2926
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:26,630
Look at that one.
That black one up on the upper left hand

2927
02:02:26,631 --> 02:02:28,370
corner right there.
Upper left.

2928
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,180
Yeah,
right there.

2929
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:31,100
Look at that.
Oh my goodness.

2930
02:02:31,930 --> 02:02:36,170
What a shape.
Those people just had a different way of

2931
02:02:36,171 --> 02:02:39,180
looking at automobiles.
They weren't confined by.

2932
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,233
What's the spot?
Big Bob's big boy and bourbon when they 

2933
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:47,210
pass by.
I never stopped in one of those.

2934
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:50,150
I've been to similar things.
I've been to the La auto show too.

2935
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:51,373
It's pretty interesting,
but I guess those cars and coffees and 

2936
02:02:53,571 --> 02:02:54,920
things he ever done one of those.
No,

2937
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:58,100
I heard those are pretty bad ass people 
like pull up with weird cars.

2938
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:00,500
Jay Leno's always showing up.
Some Burbank people.

2939
02:03:00,501 --> 02:03:04,110
They have them all over the place.
They haven't been fucking Irvine and all

2940
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:05,300
over the place.
People go to check it out.

2941
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:06,183
Yeah.
I do show every year and I asked about 

2942
02:03:07,401 --> 02:03:08,360
the El Mirage and they're like,
yeah,

2943
02:03:08,361 --> 02:03:11,020
next year you are just obsessed with 
cadillacs.

2944
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:12,880
Got To get it.
That's interesting to get it.

2945
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:16,280
So no matter how big you get catalogs,
I'll have other cars,

2946
02:03:16,490 --> 02:03:17,323
but it's going to be a caddy,
but that's your main daily driver 

2947
02:03:19,251 --> 02:03:21,490
probably is.

2948
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:23,420
I've got to get it.
I like it,

2949
02:03:23,421 --> 02:03:24,350
man.
I like it.

2950
02:03:24,351 --> 02:03:26,930
It's a different,
it's a different kind of luxury car,

2951
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:27,793
you know,
and they're really doing it right now 

2952
02:03:28,540 --> 02:03:30,530
to,
you know what else doing it right.

2953
02:03:30,650 --> 02:03:33,860
The new Lincoln navigator.
See that thing gigantic.

2954
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:35,480
The thing.
It's crazy big man.

2955
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:37,140
I think it's big.
It's luck.

2956
02:03:37,170 --> 02:03:38,010
You like it?
Yes.

2957
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,760
Yeah,
I've written them before.

2958
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:41,720
They're amazing.
I got to test drive.

2959
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:42,913
I haven't driven one,
but I've written in as a passenger in 

2960
02:03:44,721 --> 02:03:45,111
one.
I was like,

2961
02:03:45,111 --> 02:03:47,240
this thing is bad ass.
Yeah.

2962
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:51,700
I liked the new was foreign,
but that new BMW seven proof.

2963
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:56,020
It's like a couch going down the street.
You just some insane amount of money.

2964
02:03:56,670 --> 02:03:59,440
$60,000.
So this is one version of it.

2965
02:03:59,441 --> 02:04:00,274
It's the most expensive bmw they've ever
made and it's supposed to be the most 

2966
02:04:02,541 --> 02:04:04,910
technologically advanced.
And I liked the new,

2967
02:04:04,911 --> 02:04:05,744
uh,
the Porsche to the photo of a Panamera 

2968
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:08,753
man.

2969
02:04:12,710 --> 02:04:13,543
Yeah.
That's the difference between living 

2970
02:04:14,121 --> 02:04:15,830
here and living in New York,
living in New York.

2971
02:04:15,831 --> 02:04:18,380
So many people don't have cars.
Just really don't even.

2972
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:21,040
Like if you have a car in New York is a 
luxury this,

2973
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:24,670
then you thought you have to find pocket
and you go fuck this carbon.

2974
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,073
My brother,
my brother Kenny had a cough for like a 

2975
02:04:28,370 --> 02:04:29,203
summer.
It was like I gotta get up and move it 

2976
02:04:30,231 --> 02:04:31,064
every morning and when I go into the 
city I got a five pocket and he's like 

2977
02:04:34,191 --> 02:04:35,024
fuck this.
And when you drive down the street and 

2978
02:04:36,711 --> 02:04:37,980
you see ones with boots on them,

2979
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:39,690
people don't.
They don't realize what you see.

2980
02:04:39,691 --> 02:04:40,524
The tickets just piled up because 
they'll put a ticket on top of the 

2981
02:04:42,571 --> 02:04:43,404
ticket.
Yup.

2982
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:45,180
And La sometimes people will say,
hey,

2983
02:04:45,181 --> 02:04:46,710
if you already have a ticket,
they won't put another one.

2984
02:04:46,830 --> 02:04:48,540
I don't know.
In New York they don't.

2985
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:50,100
They'll put a ticket on top of the 
ticket.

2986
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:54,150
So he was just like a summer at.
What did he have?

2987
02:04:54,210 --> 02:04:56,790
He had a,
that's a different kind of living,

2988
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:57,863
living with no car,
live in liberty and a Ford thunderbird 

2989
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:02,370
like we're older.
One,

2990
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:03,793
2004.
Those were weird about this call 

2991
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:08,221
tickets.
You know,

2992
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:10,650
it's weird like that thunderbird didn't 
really totally work,

2993
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:12,600
but the challenge of work.
Perfect.

2994
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:13,460
Yeah.
The new.

2995
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:14,140
Yes.
Yeah.

2996
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:15,300
People are like,
oh Jesus.

2997
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:16,163
Yeah,
you nailed it.

2998
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:17,730
You got it.
At the thunderbird people like,

2999
02:05:17,731 --> 02:05:19,170
what are we doing here?
Is this an old car?

3000
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:20,003
It's in a new car.
We don't know who are we that they 

3001
02:05:22,531 --> 02:05:23,520
stopped making that,
right?

3002
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,690
Yep.
They don't make that anymore.

3003
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:26,220
Yeah,
charges was great.

3004
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:28,710
I don't think Ford makes anything other 
than mustangs and trucks.

3005
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,440
I think they gave up on every single car
they may bring in a bronco back.

3006
02:05:31,441 --> 02:05:32,274
I know that.
Yeah,

3007
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:34,440
bringing the Bronco back,
but I think that was a move they made.

3008
02:05:34,530 --> 02:05:35,363
Would you say Jamie,
they haven't focused or they stopped 

3009
02:05:36,751 --> 02:05:39,140
making it?
I think they decided recently.

3010
02:05:39,141 --> 02:05:42,240
We're not counting the Ford focus man.
My real cars.

3011
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:43,923
I think recently they said they're going
to cancel every car except the Mustang 

3012
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:49,170
and they're just going to make trucks.
Really?

3013
02:05:49,230 --> 02:05:50,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

3014
02:05:50,521 --> 02:05:52,260
Somebody went fucking crazy.
Well,

3015
02:05:52,261 --> 02:05:55,470
I think they'd probably make that four 
gt two and limited numbers,

3016
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:59,030
but yeah,
I think the saline is that.

3017
02:05:59,110 --> 02:06:02,310
That's a different company that takes a 
Mustang and then they put an aftermarket

3018
02:06:02,311 --> 02:06:03,144
kit on it.
Oh yeah.

3019
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:05,580
Yeah.
That's Steve Saleens company.

3020
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:09,120
They do corvettes and a bunch of other 
shit to do a bunch of different.

3021
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:10,700
It's like Hennessy.
You ever heard that?

3022
02:06:10,710 --> 02:06:12,540
Hennessy hennessy performance.

3023
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:19,080
I've heard of Hennessy performance,
but are we talking about shelby take?

3024
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:19,973
They take these cars and they'll say 
like do it to Eldorado or not an 

3025
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:28,200
Eldorado way.
They'll do it to escalate.

3026
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:30,090
They'll do it.
Two corvettes.

3027
02:06:30,091 --> 02:06:30,924
Mustangs.
They'll take a regular car and put a 

3028
02:06:32,150 --> 02:06:33,130
thousand horsepower in it.
Oh Wow.

3029
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:34,690
And sell it.
So it's.

3030
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:37,110
But it's not.
I mean it's not just a corvette,

3031
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:39,240
it's a hennessy corvette.
Now it's like,

3032
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,270
you know,
like a saline Mustang is like,

3033
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:43,770
it's like a shelby Mustang.
Kind of similar,

3034
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:45,960
but shelby,
they sell from the Ford dealerships.

3035
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:50,130
Some Ford dealerships sell St John's.
Some of them do that.

3036
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:53,550
You can buy them a few of legitimate 
drunk when I'm drunk.

3037
02:06:53,551 --> 02:06:54,384
And my performance on Hennessy Hennessy 
hennessy performance for to stop making 

3038
02:06:57,391 --> 02:07:01,290
all passenger cars except the Mustang 
explorer.

3039
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:03,390
Yeah.
So they're just doing trucks.

3040
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:04,960
Yeah.
And the Bronco,

3041
02:07:04,961 --> 02:07:06,630
but that's a dope one car.

3042
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:08,160
That's weird.
That's the bullet car.

3043
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:09,930
That's the attribute to the Steve 
McQueen movie.

3044
02:07:09,931 --> 02:07:11,670
That's what that green car is.
Look at that thing.

3045
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:13,800
Damn,
that is gorgeous.

3046
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:16,080
Great movie by the way.
Yeah,

3047
02:07:16,081 --> 02:07:17,580
it is a great movie.
They nailed it though.

3048
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:21,600
See Ford nailed it with these mustangs.
They figured out a perfect way to make a

3049
02:07:21,601 --> 02:07:23,460
shape that makes you think about old 
cars,

3050
02:07:23,461 --> 02:07:26,910
but it looks like a new car.
What do they call it?

3051
02:07:26,911 --> 02:07:29,970
An Ode to the past.
Yes or no to the past.

3052
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,380
That's nice.
Young Tony Rock.

3053
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:32,223
Tony are going to wrap this up.
We just talked about cars for the last 

3054
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:36,700
shit.
Sorry.

3055
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:39,880
Sorry.
But people please go see Tony Rock.

3056
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:42,040
No bullshit.
You one of the funniest guys alive.

3057
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,650
I'm a big fan.
Kansas City Improv this weekend.

3058

3059

named.

3063
02:07:56,371 --> 02:07:59,280
Give it up.
Give it up.

3064
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,300
Is it a real.
Tony Rock is his name.

3065
02:08:01,301 --> 02:08:02,600
Tony Rock,
I doubt it.

3066
02:08:02,690 --> 02:08:04,480
New.
I think there's only one.

3067
02:08:04,770 --> 02:08:05,591
Alright.
Anyway,

3068
02:08:05,591 --> 02:08:06,424
man,
thanks so much.

3069
02:08:07,210 --> 02:08:08,140
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
