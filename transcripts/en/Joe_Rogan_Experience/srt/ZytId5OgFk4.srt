1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,460
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,310
I don't want to fuck this up,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,550
but it looks like it says pop pop,

4
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,384
pop,

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,690
pop,

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,600
Hoopa pub.

7
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,443
Who Pot.

8
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,380
I'm probably fucking that up,

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,880
but this is how it's pronounced.

10
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,040
I know how to spell it.

11
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,910
You don't like that one guy that
got arrested for murdering his wife?

12
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,370
Was that,

13
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,203
what was that guy?

14
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,340
That old guy.

15
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,000
Phil Spectrum.

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,833
Phil Spector.

17
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,351
Oh no,

18
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:26,250
that wasn't his wife.

19
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,431
Oh,

20
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,264
that's hilarious.

21
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,471
That's very funny,

22
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:28,801
actually.

23
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:29,634
Good.

24
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,120
That's strong.

25
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,341
Strong.

26
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:32,941
Remember that guy?

27
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:34,050
He would show up for court?

28
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,440
Yeah,

29
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,340
with these crazy wigs on check.

30
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,600
He's got a brother Kimbal Musk,

31
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:42,991
Elon Musk.

32
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:45,520
He's a super genius that
exists in the Lotus position.

33
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,560
Floats in midair and some wheat silo
somewhere in New Hampshire and they go

34
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:51,090
visit them a couple of times a month.

35
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,891
I wouldn't mind.

36
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:53,341
I would be like,

37
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,200
give me a free test every couple of days.

38
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,410
They probably got that dude in the
bunker with Dick Cheney right now.

39
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,910
Kimbal Musk.

40
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,900
What does he say?

41
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,051
Yeah,

42
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:02,100
I want to know what Kimble does.

43
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,020
He teaches Kung Fu.

44
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,480
He's in those videos that
I always post on Instagram.

45
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,420
He just imagine if his
brother was just a a nut.

46
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,750
Oh look at him.

47
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,780
Handsome bastard drinking coffee.

48
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,770
Oh my age.

49
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:17,000
45 regional manager for blockbuster video.

50
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,270
He's from South Africa.

51
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,120
I forget which guy was,

52
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,040
we were having a good fucking time though.

53
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,110
That was before anybody
knew who rampage was.

54
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,220
I misunderstood him cause he was
going by the slug once again,

55
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,270
like 99 2000.

56
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,330
I had finished it,

57
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:33,990
Ucla where I first got my
taste of Jujitsu was at Ucla.

58
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:34,340
And then I got,

59
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,080
I graduated and I went to teen punishment
and I get on the mat and Fabiana you

60
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,230
was a coach there at the time.

61
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,040
Find out what the best arm
bars in the duty Monday.

62
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,790
His arm bar was fine,

63
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,830
especially Farside side.

64
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,611
And so we,

65
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:48,444
um,

66
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,660
I got on the mat and I shake
hands with this dude and I said,

67
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:53,911
hey,

68
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:54,481
my name's Jimmy.

69
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,050
And he goes,

70
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm rampage.

71
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,930
And I thought I misunderstood him.

72
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:58,880
I was like,

73
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,670
he can't sit,

74
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,880
you know,

75
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,211
I was like,

76
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:01,140
is it Randall or something?

77
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:02,250
And I just misunderstood him.

78
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,840
And all I knew was I knew armbarring to
foot locker at the time and he was so

79
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:07,141
big.

80
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:07,341
I was like,

81
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:08,340
I'm just gonna foot log him and,

82
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:08,791
and I,

83
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,230
I went fully straight full locks on them.

84
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:10,500
And again,

85
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm like,

86
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,101
Oh my God,

87
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:11,790
I'm going him.

88
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,790
And then I got an arm bar on him and he
lifted me up to the ceiling with one arm

89
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,200
just around at my ass just went boom,

90
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,034
dropped right on me.

91
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,740
And Fabiano comes running over mad like,

92
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,041
oh,

93
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:23,760
you're not supposed to do that.

94
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,820
And just start screaming at him.

95
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,440
And he walks off ramp.

96
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,241
He turns to me.

97
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:27,940
He goes,

98
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,471
that'd be cool,

99
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:28,680
right?

100
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:28,981
And I was like,

101
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:29,101
yeah,

102
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:29,581
we're fine,

103
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:29,731
man.

104
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:30,261
I'm a wrestler.

105
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:30,400
I,

106
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,571
you know,

107
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,021
no big deal.

108
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,670
I've been slammed before and that was it.

109
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:34,380
That time it meant Quinten man back then.

110
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

111
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,900
Jeff Novitsky.

112
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,740
How are you buddy?

113
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,400
What's up Joe?

114
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,970
Doing good.

115
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,900
I have to ask you,

116
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,900
do you mind the nickname
the golden snitch?

117
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,310
So first thing I was going to bring up

118
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,580
this golden snitch bullshit.

119
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,681
I just want to say,

120
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:51,000
it's not my nickname.

121
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:52,200
It's Brennan jobs.

122
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,210
He came up with it 100% on his own.

123
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,303
He was going to ask you.

124
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,423
It's all good though.

125
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,181
It's good.

126
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,014
It's all good.

127
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,860
So a couple of funny stories about that.

128
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,694
So

129
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
when did you come up with this?

130
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,370
About a year ago at least.

131
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,270
So,

132
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,640
so people in the office
started coming up to me saying,

133
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:06,881
hey,

134
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,714
golden snitch,

135
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,620
what the hell is that?

136
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,780
Doing a little research as she,

137
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:13,340
something about Harry Potter,

138
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,470
some character named there.

139
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:14,711
I'm like,

140
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,120
what the hell does this
have to do with me?

141
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,820
So about a month ago,

142
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,990
somebody lets me know,

143
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,231
hey,

144
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,430
check out Wikipedia.

145
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,090
So for whatever reason there's
a Jeff Novitsky Wikipedia page.

146
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,400
You go to that page now it says,

147
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,701
says,

148
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,690
actually my formal name,

149
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,730
Jeffrey John Novitsky,

150
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,300
Aka the golden snitch.

151
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,170
So last week Donna Marceline,

152
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,053
you know Donna,

153
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,923
um,

154
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,763
long,

155
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,640
15 year employee of the UFC now works
with me and talk about her a little later.

156
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,050
It's a great asset to what we're doing.

157
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,700
She sends me a text,

158
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,001
she says,

159
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,834
check this out.

160
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,070
So she's got one of those Amazon Echos.

161
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,090
Um,

162
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,880
Alexa,

163
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,361
I think so.

164
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,141
She says Alexa,

165
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:57,010
who's Jeff Novitsky and Alexis
names as Jeffery John Novitsky,

166
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,780
Aka the golden snitch.

167
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,531
So thanks a lot.

168
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:03,364
Shop.

169
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,930
Oh shove,

170
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,840
what have you done?

171
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,660
Just bdis locked in on me and I
think this thing's going to kill me.

172
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,040
And so I'm thinking,

173
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,000
you know,

174
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,290
when I say I'm thinking,

175
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,850
I don't know if I'm thinking,

176
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,943
I'm just,

177
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,250
I just remembered what I,

178
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,970
what was kind of going
through my head at the time.

179
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,700
I thought,

180
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,360
Oh fuck,

181
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,230
I'm gonna die.

182
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,540
And my protections right there,

183
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:24,870
like,

184
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,620
I'm going to die.

185
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,320
This is that since
situation where I'm dead.

186
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
And they talk about it and
he could have saved himself,

187
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:31,740
but his guns on the ground.

188
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:32,820
And I think that that was like,

189
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,550
go for the gun was my whole thing.

190
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,170
So I start to go for the gun.

191
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:39,690
Yonis would've been here as I remember it.

192
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,120
And so I start to go
for the gun and realize,

193
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:42,361
fuck,

194
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:46,560
I don't have time to get to my gun and
it's three feet away to that bears like

195
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,750
right there coming down on me so fast.

196
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,080
So I kind of do like a
football juke move left,

197
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,123
right.

198
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,390
And then wheel around right.

199
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,750
Do like a spin with my back and
they start running to the left.

200
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,840
And at that point Yonis it,

201
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:00,971
I,

202
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:04,560
I didn't know this at the time because I
looked at some pictures afterwards kind

203
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:05,820
of piece everything together.

204
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,410
So your honest was
sitting right next to me.

205
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,910
I think he got up to turn.

206
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,770
There were some trekking poles right here.

207
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,390
He grabbed a trekking pole.

208
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:13,770
So probably while I was joking,

209
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,790
he reached around and grabbed
the trekking pole swings around,

210
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,970
hits the bear in the face.

211
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,250
She's so then the IC,

212
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:21,150
the bear running off.

213
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:23,490
Then I see someone going down
the mountain with the bear.

214
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,900
I'm thinking he's got someone.

215
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:25,860
So I grabbed my pistol,

216
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:28,650
start going down the mountain yelling,

217
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,230
Oh I Guess I,

218
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,500
I will count off.

219
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,450
And everyone's like one,

220
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,870
one,

221
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,170
one.

222
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,571
And I'm like,

223
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:34,240
Oh shit,

224
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,250
who's missing?

225
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:35,940
Right.

226
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,610
And then Garrett pops up out
of the bushes and his eye,

227
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,500
he's like wide eyed.

228
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,240
So Garrett,

229
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,871
Ak dirt,

230
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:42,561
dirt myth.

231
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:44,460
He's the one who was on top of the,

232
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:46,470
somehow he's on the barriers back.

233
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,730
So I think when the bear wheeled around
you like hit him and he ends up on the

234
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:51,001
back.

235
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:54,030
So I saw just legs and bear
going down the mountain.

236
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,940
I saw his legs on the
back of the bear somehow.

237
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,370
Like maybe the bear had him in his job.

238
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,611
Yeah,

239
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:59,570
that's what I was thinking.

240
00:05:59,660 --> 00:05:59,871
Well,

241
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:00,490
I mean who?

242
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,400
Who would think

243
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,760
like if that was in a movie,

244
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:05,181
you'd be like,

245
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,014
get the fuck outta here.

246
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,340
What was that anchorman
where the guy's like,

247
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:10,370
you're riding the bear.

248
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,850
That's exactly like God.

249
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,750
Yes.

250
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,160
And then we just kind of circled up around
the tree and the real scary part was

251
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,260
that bear.

252
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,010
So it was so thick.

253
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:23,180
You really couldn't see.

254
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,620
I mean,

255
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,580
you could see maybe as
far as the wall from us,

256
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,470
which was that the tree feet.

257
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,333
Yeah.

258
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,440
And just real thick brush.

259
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,540
And you'd hear the bear charge in again,

260
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,630
and we only have the two
pistols Yiannis and I and the,

261
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,200
the,

262
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,430
the wind was so strong,

263
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,110
there's no way we could use bear spray.

264
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,090
So we hear the bear charging in and
me and Yanna like pistols out ready,

265
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,550
waiting for this thing to
pop out at point blank range.

266
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,510
And then you would see
in your were yelling,

267
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,250
hey,

268
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,780
and then that thing stops.

269
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,793
And then it would just,

270
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,550
it crash off and then it would
charge in from the other direction.

271
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,030
She ain't gotta like circle around
the tree the other way and did that,

272
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,350
I think three times.

273
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,580
That was just a nerd.

274
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,790
It's like a horror movie where it
keeps coming in from different angles.

275
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,230
It was weird.

276
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,030
It was not a fun feeling.

277
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:11,320
You just felt so small.

278
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:21,310
Yeah.
