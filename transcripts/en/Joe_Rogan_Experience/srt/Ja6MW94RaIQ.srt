1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,450
The joe rogan experience
and the Olympic Games,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:04,891
the the,

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:07,360
the event that probably requires more.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:09,620
Okay.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,950
Transfer of energy and development
of kinetic energy than any other,

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,230
there's a bunch you could name,

7
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:15,741
but one of them.

8
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:16,011
For me,

9
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:16,700
it's always going to be the,

10
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,260
the javelin throw the javelin throw
involves a full pallet sprint,

11
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,043
a jump,

12
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,970
a massive explosive tuning of both
hips and shoulders and a throw.

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:36,020
All the quintessential explosive elements
of the human body are involved in the

14
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:36,854
javelins room,

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,190
probably to a greater degree
than any other Olympic event.

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,111
And as a result,

17
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,600
people can throw a javelin 80 90 meters.

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,420
What would happen if you took those same
javelin throwers and made them perform

19
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:52,400
the same event on the knees?

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,100
Wouldn't be so good.

21
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,110
They probably couldn't throw
it more than 10 meters.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,131
Okay,

23
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:00,941
and what's changed?

24
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:02,410
The closer they get to the ground,

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,980
the less they can employ explosive force.

26
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,880
What's the first thing cowboys do
when they go to Brian to steer?

27
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,560
Take it down.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,393
Yeah.

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,921
They lock up.

30
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:14,200
It's the legs and they
put it down on the ground.

31
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,900
Nobody tries to brand as standing still.

32
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:21,640
You're going to get killed because it
can employ explosive dynamic movement to

33
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:22,474
hurt you.

34
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,040
You put them on the ground.

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,700
Dynamic explosive movement
is massively curtailed.

36
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,510
It takes away the single
riskiest element of fighting,

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,020
which is quick dynamic movement
that can generate kinetic energy.

38
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,660
So step number one,

39
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:39,190
it was going to do it so it
was get it to the ground.

40
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,050
It's inherently safer.

41
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,120
Less things can go catastrophic.

42
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:45,250
We wrong on the ground and
in the standing position.

43
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,950
What step number two?

44
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:49,781
Secure.

45
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:52,720
Dominant position control.

46
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,711
Control.

47
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:54,460
Too vague.

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,690
There's many ways to control people.

49
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,010
There's a definite step.

50
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:58,000
You've just taken a guy down.

51
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,080
What's your first thing and was on units?

52
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,993
Yeah,

53
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,900
well the first thing I would try to
do is get to a dominant position.

54
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,771
What do you mean by that?

55
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:07,300
Being by just pass to side control.

56
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,183
Try to match it.

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,001
You just answered it right.

58
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:09,834
Then get pastas,

59
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,703
legs,

60
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,703
passes legs.

61
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,713
Why?

62
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,710
It's legs are strong.

63
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,570
I carry you around.

64
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,930
You could hold a person in position.

65
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:19,170
They,

66
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,400
they're very good defensively.

67
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,803
They dangerous.

68
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,033
Too dangerous.

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,420
If I end up inside your legs,

70
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,051
if you're a skilled,

71
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:25,471
juicy play,

72
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:26,221
you can unlock me.

73
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:26,911
Can Lake Lock me,

74
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:29,160
can strangle me even if
you were an untrained,

75
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:29,461
funny,

76
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:30,294
you could up kick me.

77
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,720
Right.

78
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,430
Mania man has been
knocked out by an upkick.

79
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,290
Even an untutored guy can pull it up,

80
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,760
get sure lakes are dangerous.

81
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,950
So step number two is get pasta.

82
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:38,970
Those dangerous lakes.

83
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,070
What state number three?

84
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,930
Go for submission.

85
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,663
No,

86
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,550
he must be a 10th planet belt.

87
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,650
So yeah,

88
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,860
I hate to throw that in some rigid.

89
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:50,960
Oh,

90
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,480
I'm um,

91
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,070
it's,

92
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,620
it's one of those things
like it has to be regulated.

93
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,220
It has to be protected and it has to be
guaranteed as a thing for human beings.

94
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,330
Not even just Americans.

95
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:01,821
Well,

96
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:02,181
it's just,

97
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:07,181
it's stunning to me how many people
are against the idea of having an open

98
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:08,414
internet.

99
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,713
Yeah.

100
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,371
Well,

101
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:10,551
you know,

102
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:11,480
most of the polling,

103
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:13,040
I think polls are always,

104
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:13,761
you gotta be careful,

105
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,001
right?

106
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:16,460
Because they can ask a question
one way and get an answer.

107
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:20,600
But the best one done was right before
our boat by the University of Maryland,

108
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,670
found 83% of the public supported net
neutrality opposed what we were doing.

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,890
But who are those 17% dummies?

110
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,060
That's what I want to know.

111
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,470
I think anything you can get the American
public to agree to at 83% is a pretty,

112
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:37,880
I think it's wonderful but I'm
stunned [inaudible] 17% yeah,

113
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,803
seriously.

114
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,250
But isn't there a bunch of people?

115
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,613
There's some,

116
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,160
and I,

117
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,030
I wrote about this on Twitter
recently without judgment.

118
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,440
I said that net neutrality seems to me
to be one of those ideological issues

119
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,663
where um,

120
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,760
if you're on the right you support it
or if you're on the left rather you

121
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,840
support it where you're on the right,

122
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,290
you would like it to go away.

123
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,250
So almost like totally disagree with,

124
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,520
okay,

125
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,910
please do.

126
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,010
If you are

127
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,940
a democrat or a Republican,

128
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,190
you benefit from net neutrality
and internet openness.

129
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:10,200
If you're conservative or liberal.

130
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,090
If you're a big business
or a small business,

131
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:14,070
you benefit from Internet openness.

132
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,110
And the history of net neutrality is
something that doesn't get discussed

133
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:19,944
enough,

134
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,010
which is that it began the first time
the FCC put net neutrality policy on

135
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:25,530
paper.

136
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,530
It was 2005 and I'm old enough to remember
that that was when President George

137
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,380
W.

138
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,400
Bush was in the White House.

139
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,563
In other words,

140
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,780
this country's first net
neutrality policies were put
on paper one a republican

141
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,800
was running the FCC.

142
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,710
It is only in recent days.

143
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,070
We have characterize this as a left
right issue and I think that's a

144
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:48,300
fundamentally a mistake.

145
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,330
How did it happen like when when Ajit
Pi proposes legislation and passed it,

146
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,460
it baffled me.

147
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,800
I thought net neutrality was
a thing we had all agreed on.

148
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,221
It was like,

149
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,330
we're never touching this.

150
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,620
How did this happen?

151
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,630
Oh,

152
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,150
well,

153
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,541
you know,

154
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,430
through a whole bunch of boring Washington

155
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,100
seizures whereby they circulate out
of proposed rulemaking or how did,

156
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,660
how did he get the power
and leverage to pass this?

157
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,920
I think that he was supported
by people in Washington,

158
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,950
including some broadband providers and
was led to believe that with deregulation

159
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,480
we would all be better off

160
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,040
being away from race car driving.

161
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,310
When you deciding at just
like enough is enough,

162
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,540
do you think that in
some ways that this is,

163
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,070
you appreciating other
aspects of life too that you,

164
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,550
you're,

165
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,500
you're looking at your
racing thing and you're like,

166
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,040
you know what,

167
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,090
I did a lot,

168
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,410
I did enough and then why don't I
just appreciate all the other stuff?

169
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,030
Well,

170
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,320
I think that's a good question.

171
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:53,820
A lead to me into a good thought.

172
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:54,330
Like,

173
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,163
um,

174
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,180
I think it's actually more

175
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,630
being honest.

176
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,490
Like I think everyone would expect since
I do what I do at the level that I do

177
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:04,821
it at,

178
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:07,190
the racing is my only thing I care about.

179
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:07,881
I love it so much.

180
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,500
I'll do anything I drive every day.

181
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,120
And the truth is no,

182
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,411
I like racing,

183
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:12,830
but I don't,

184
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,980
there's a lot of things I don't really
like about it too and I'm grateful for

185
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:16,940
everything it's given me.

186
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:21,020
But if you were to ask me what I do
outside of racing and my personal life,

187
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,190
I don't go to the race track.

188
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,540
I don't really watch races.

189
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,374
I don't,

190
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,191
I don't do that.

191
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,330
So those aren't my hobbies.

192
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,070
Like your hobbies or your real loves,

193
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,900
what do you not like about it?

194
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,383
Um,

195
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,510
well I would say that
in the last year or so,

196
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:35,990
the,

197
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,823
just the,

198
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,020
as far as an energetic space,

199
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:42,740
it's just so sad and negative
at t a lot of the time.

200
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,750
And even in just racing in general,

201
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:46,790
most of the time it's miserable.

202
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,380
Like you'd have some days that are good,

203
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:51,080
but most of the time it's not
happy and you wish there was,

204
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:51,371
you're,

205
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:51,710
you're,

206
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,240
you're,

207
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,700
you're on.

208
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,900
You're not satisfied.

209
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:56,930
You wish somebody would have
treated you better out there.

210
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,170
You,

211
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,070
there's so many things to be negative
about and just the grind of it.

212
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,120
Um,

213
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,120
it's the people like everybody's
worn out and you know,

214
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:10,070
you have to be really careful about
the people that are around you because

215
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:13,280
they've got to be in a good mood because
it's easy to spiral out of control

216
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,170
because you see each other for three,

217
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:15,921
four days a week,

218
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,630
every week for 40 weeks a year.

219
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,080
So,

220
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,390
you know,

221
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,690
you gotta be in a good space with people,

222
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,120
but it still doesn't
alienate you completely.

223
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:23,780
Even if there,

224
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,210
you're in a good space with
people that the ones next to you,

225
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,810
cause you got a car next to you on both
sides in the garage and haulers next to

226
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:32,900
each other and buses right next to
each other and you see a bunch of other

227
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:33,320
people.

228
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,070
So,

229
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,351
you know,

230
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:35,030
it was just,

231
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,361
I don't know,

232
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:37,460
there's a lot of
negativity to some degree.

233
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,330
Um,

234
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,230
a lot of grind.

235
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:41,150
It just kind of feels like
the grind a little bit.

236
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,373
Um,

237
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,040
and um,

238
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,390
so I just kind of felt like it wasn't
a space that I wanted to be in as much

239
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:47,841
anymore.

240
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:47,991
Like,

241
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:48,790
I,

242
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,310
I want to be in a happy space where I'm
just doing things that bring me joy.

243
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,080
And um,

244
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,680
yeah,

245
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,290
it just,

246
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,340
there wasn't doing that as
much or I was noticing it,

247
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,490
I was noticing I was missing
that or wanting it more.

248
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,970
I think that's really what it comes from
is growing as a person and realizing,

249
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,413
um,

250
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,100
I think everybody's afraid to take
chances and do something new in their life

251
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:13,580
because they're identified a certain way
or there'll be judged if they don't do

252
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:16,940
it or judged if they do
something different and who
are they now and are they

253
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,320
crazy and what are they thinking?

254
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,550
And you know,

255
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,690
it's just life.

256
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,430
Just do things that make you happy.

257
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,540
In his case,

258
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,200
his kidneys were in trouble
and his heart was in trouble.

259
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,000
And the cells,

260
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,893
they don't,

261
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,600
unlike what we used to
think in the early days,

262
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:33,890
they don't become anything.

263
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,460
These kinds of,

264
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,250
this kind of stem cell does not
become anything in your body,

265
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,220
but at home,

266
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,220
areas of that need repair and it secretes
things that stimulates the repair and

267
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,950
decrease the inflammation and
helps out with the immune system.

268
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:48,920
So the vast majority of what we
treat or autoimmune diseases.

269
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,933
And um,

270
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:50,511
in,

271
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:51,590
in Hud's case,

272
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,300
we gave him ivs so that,

273
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,160
that he could basically have these

274
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,050
things on board.

275
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,670
So creating the,

276
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,700
the secreting the cytokines and the,

277
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:03,090
and the growth factors
that are normally secreted.

278
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,180
And when you're 92 and you
have multiorgan failure,

279
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,190
you're basically running on fumes.

280
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,020
And so you put these days
zero young healthy cells and
they secrete these things

281
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,240
that kind of restarts everything.

282
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,260
Yeah.

283
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,080
And so what was his response
to this Ivy Treatment?

284
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,790
Wow.

285
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,130
Uh,

286
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,550
I,

287
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,960
you know,

288
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,310
I,

289
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:21,960
I could,

290
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,580
I can wax lyrical about that.

291
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:26,490
He's almost a hundred years old and,

292
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:26,880
uh,

293
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,380
from pretty bad shape.

294
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,730
It was like bee stings.

295
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,470
It was like he got a new lease of life.

296
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,340
Like he got a big dose locally in the hip,

297
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,520
which a fixed all his
inflammation and pain.

298
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,840
And he started walking again,

299
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,790
and his kidneys were good.

300
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,690
And his heart,

301
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,330
he had a prolapse valves
in there and they healed.

302
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:45,901
And,

303
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:46,734
uh,

304
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,461
his,

305
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,294
um,

306
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,860
cognitive powers improved.

307
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,750
His eyesight improved.

308
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,703
Whoa.

309
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,520
You know,

310
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,910
and other stuff improved that I ate.

311
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,130
He would hate me to talk about it,

312
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,120
but he had two nurses that
reported to me and it was like,

313
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:03,990
holy mackerel,

314
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,440
that's using it as a towel rack,

315
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,513
you know?

316
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,030
Yeah.
