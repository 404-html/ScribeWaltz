1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,210
They have different that I'm learning
in between when I do comedy and acting.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,390
Is that like the last thing people really
want to see from the on your own stage

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:10,170
as you really get emotional,
you know, but when you asked,

4
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:11,520
you have to go to that

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,380
right away. Big Difference.
We're live. Is it working?

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,310
Oh my Jesus. Right at the
end of the candid moment. No,

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,590
I think you're totally right.
Well,

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,540
Ron Funches and I were talking about
people getting mad. First of all,

9
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,960
welcome to the show strength
or having me being here, man.

10
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:30,690
I'm pretty sure we were talking about
people getting getting emotional on stage.

11
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,480
If people get angry on stage that um,

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,760
it shows the audience can feel it. You
could say the exact same words and with,

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,650
with like a fake anger as we were saying,

14
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:45,270
like Brody was really good at like he had,
he would fake be mad at you.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,370
I mean, it was, it was Louis Black. Yes.
If you could see those exact same words,

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,900
there's like a smile to it,
right?

17
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:55,290
You were saying that there's
a nod or a hint hint of a nod.

18
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,260
Yeah, there's a little wink that lets
you know that this isn't, this is a joke,

19
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:01,410
I'm not really this mad about it.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,050
And is it usually an absurdity
about the thing they're mad at? Yes.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,380
You know when you get,

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,270
we all see those sets sometimes when
like someone's recently broken up with

23
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,200
somebody and then you like,

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,750
you get that real anger and then you
could say something funny but like,

25
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:19,560
it's too fresh.
It's too real,

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,690
don't want heritage, want to hear
it makes them feel uncomfortable.

27
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,520
And we were talking about
how weird it is the,

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,800
that you could actually have something
that sounded so similar to that,

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,400
but we could tell the difference, like
with the exact same words, you know,

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,800
with enthusiasm, just something's off
about it. Something's off about that,

31
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:42,680
you know, it's funny versus something's
off about it where you know,

32
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:45,630
that person's serious
and a person like I was,

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,160
we were just saying try to explain
that to someone who doesn't understand

34
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:52,580
English or doesn't understand human
communication. They'd be like, what?

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,270
How can you tell? Like, how can you tell
it's fake? How can you tell us fake anger?

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,160
Yeah, that's what mates, I
mean the language, so fun.
It's not just about the words,

37
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,980
it's about the intent behind the word.

38
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,863
Yes.

39
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,990
And body language and posture
and make a comedy so deep.

40
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:14,250
You know, I love about it. Oh
for sure. Yeah. I mean there,

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,480
what we're trying to do is convey intent
or trying to figure out a way to sneak

42
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:23,950
ideas into your head where maybe you
didn't see the punchline. Common. Yeah.

43
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,420
It's a, it's a very strange art
form. Like one of the strangest ever.

44
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,850
So cause it's, uh, I've, I've always said
it's almost like a form of mass hypnosis.

45
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,580
Do you feel that sometimes,
like can your middle of the sat and you,

46
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:41,200
you're in the groove? Yeah.
Um, a lot of ways. Um,

47
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,470
one of 'em

48
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,151
I mean you,

49
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:48,470
and you're a weird guy so it doesn't
matter what it's going to get weird in

50
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:52,910
multiple ways. But um, when I
first started my acting class, um,

51
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,150
I was talking about that, what, what,
what my acting coach. And I'd be like,

52
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,180
there's a point like if my sets really
going well where I'm in the present

53
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:06,390
moment of enjoying the set and saying
these words, but at the same time I'm,

54
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:09,190
I'm in the future thinking
about what's coming next.

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,720
I'm surveying everything that's going
around me and I'm also still kind of like

56
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,740
judging myself off of what just happened.

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,580
So this thing happens where you're kind
of like time traveling in a way where

58
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,180
you don't exist in any one space of time.
You,

59
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:27,190
you just kind of like
remove yourself from that.

60
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,840
And when your sets going really well,

61
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,920
that's the thing that my girlfriend and
I have talked about is that you can hear

62
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,430
these sets and hear these jokes. Maybe
you can see someone said multiple time,

63
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,600
but they're really good.

64
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,470
Oftentimes you don't remember the joke
like how many times people go back and

65
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,650
quote a joke to you and they've got it
half wrong because they've heard you with

66
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:46,481
a thousand times,

67
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,170
but they don't know they got the joke
half wrong because you've hypnotized them.

68
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,300
They don't even remember it,
you know?

69
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,970
Yeah. Or some people remember shit.
You don't remember anymore. Yeah,

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,270
that's a weird one. Yeah. I've had people
come up to me and tell me a bit, I go,

71
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,790
what? What bid is that? And
they'll tell me the bit, I'm like,

72
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,980
when is that from the 2014 I'm like,
I don't even remember that.

73
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,410
Yeah, just something you were
trying out. Every now knows.

74
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,210
That's what's fun now for
me as I'm getting a little
bit deeper than I'm coming

75
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:19,450
up on 13 years is now,
now I'm getting the point where I'm like,

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,680
Oh this bit that I tried two
or three years ago now work.

77
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,190
Yes. Yeah. That's really fun. Yeah,

78
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:29,510
I remember that that time you are,

79
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,590
you're essentially a a phd in
comedy when you got 10 years in.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Like if you have do real 10 hard years
of comedy and then after that it seems

81
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,060
like some, some guys, I mean it
all depends on the artist, right?

82
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:48,061
But some guys have their best work like
1516 years in or just starting to catch

83
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,030
the groove and figure out what
it is. You know, cause it's a,

84
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,830
it's only understood by the
people who practice it. It's,

85
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,990
it's understood in a way by
a lot of people who are, um,

86
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,300
comedy fans.

87
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,230
But that's similar to like
me being a fan of music.

88
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:08,680
I don't know shit about music, but I know
what I like. I know when it sounds good.

89
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,870
Yeah.
I literally don't understand any of it.

90
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,360
So I think there's those
kinds of people too.

91
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,610
Yeah. I mean comedy is such a, yeah,
I mean that's where gives great.

92
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:19,361
When your peers,

93
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:24,010
what's one thing that I loved about
doing my special other than like people

94
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:26,830
seeing it and being able to like I
wanted to just make something and put

95
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:27,590
something out.

96
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,900
I had always done like small little
things or guested on people's things and I

97
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:36,730
was like, oh, I'm been doing comedy over
10 years and I'm sure a lot of potential.

98
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:38,560
I want to present a male.

99
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,830
And when I put it out and like people's
reaction was great but the but my peers

100
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,600
is what really made me happy
that when I would get texts from,

101
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,110
from like Malanie or time,

102
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:56,410
some people being like you are or
just be like this was your hour,

103
00:05:56,411 --> 00:06:01,220
this is you presenting who you are
completely right and that and that. Um,

104
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,880
when people can see the stuff behind it,
when it's not just like joke, punchline,

105
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,990
joke, punchline. When people can
see like, oh you set this up,

106
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:13,340
you did this rag, your structure is
right and then you just wear yourself.

107
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:15,890
That's what really makes
me happy in comedy.

108
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,610
Yeah. Yeah. You're a funny
dude man. I enjoy watching.

109
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,830
You have washed to quite a few times
the comedy store now in the main room.

110
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:24,240
You very,
very funny man.

111
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,380
It's cool to see a guy
like you put something down
that's representative of your

112
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:30,900
real, your real stand up,
what you're capable of doing.

113
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,410
It's a nice group to be a part of man.

114
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:38,040
And you sound like you think about
it a lot. I really appreciate that.

115
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,770
When people think about like what
it is we're doing, how do you do it?

116
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,360
How do you do it? Like, do you
write, do you write on paper?

117
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:47,580
Do you write with a typewriter?
Do you just write,

118
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,450
just have ideas and you
just keep working on them?

119
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,910
It's all a mix. You know,
I like to say like I'm a,

120
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:56,950
I'm more of a Fisher than a hunter.
Like I'm not constantly like, oh,

121
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:00,490
I need to write his down every day.
I have the structure,

122
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,080
but I'm constantly like,
I try to make my house that we're,

123
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,520
we're constantly always
joking around with each other.

124
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,230
There's notebooks everywhere.

125
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:12,340
There's like little bowls of like
with post it notes for me, whenever I,

126
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,160
an idea comes,

127
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:17,080
I had to make sure I catch it and then
I had to make sure that I work on it,

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,600
you know? Um, that becomes a different,

129
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:24,150
it's just constantly keeping myself
in motion so that I don't, um,

130
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,900
get stagnant and I don't just do the same
10, 15 over and over again that cause,

131
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,400
you know, that's where I think especially,
um, when I first moved out here,

132
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:36,010
it was always about like, oh, I got
to show these people that I'm good,

133
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:38,500
so I got to do my best work,
my best work.

134
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,330
And I did that for about three
months and I was like, oh,

135
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:43,990
I don't have anything in the kitchen.
I don't have any backup. You know,

136
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,260
I haven't been building anything up.
And so I learned very quickly,

137
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,440
I think the comedy store has been the
best for me or that it just being like I'm

138
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,520
having to like follow people who are
completely not like me stylistically.

139
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,500
Um, having to follow people who
I grew up watching. You know,

140
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,900
I did a, um, night the other
day where I had to follow,

141
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:09,040
it was Sebastian and then Ron Wyatt
and then me. And then I was like, oh,

142
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:13,300
there's no, I mean, I'm like, ah, I'm
confident in myself when people know me.

143
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,230
But when it comes to that,

144
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:18,490
it's like I'm the bottom of the totem
pole on those three and I had to go out

145
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:21,640
there and just show them that like,
I'm capable.

146
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,420
I'm not going to mess up the momentum
here. I'm just as funny as these people.

147
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,390
You just don't know me.
You haven't met me yet.

148
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,140
That's the thing I've been listening to
a lot. Like there's rappers all the time,

149
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:35,620
but like this rapper, two
Chainz where he said like, um,

150
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,110
I just had to wait for,

151
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,040
for the fans and for the game
to learn what I already knew.

152
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,710
And that's where I'm starting
to feel now a new confidence.

153
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:48,910
If like I know I'm good and I just have
to wait for people to catch up on my

154
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:53,470
wave and I don't. If they
don't, they don't. If they do
find just very jazz of you.

155
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,160
Two Chainz

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,160
was the guy who debated Nancy grace about
weed or remember that weight is going

157
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:06,570
to kill you.
He outlasted her.

158
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,990
Yeah. That didn't work. I mean,

159
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:14,730
it's hilarious now and see how many states
have legalized it. In full disclosure,

160
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:18,000
Ron and I smoked marijuana with
young Jamie before this podcast.

161
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,100
I guess weight as I do so many others.

162
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,190
It's finally the stigmas slowly
being removed slowly. Dude,

163
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,670
I was a drug addict in the
90s when I started, when I
first started smoking weed,

164
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,130
I guess it was a not even the
nineties it was like, wow,

165
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:36,420
that was a nightmare in 98
or 99 somewhere around that.

166
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,260
It's when I started smoking weed and uh,
you were a drug addict.

167
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,610
You were a drug addict. You're a
marijuana user. It's wrong with you, man.

168
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,690
Get your shit together. I'm like, man,
you guys don't get it. There's two chains.

169
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,500
There he is. Nancy grace. They put the
stuff on the screen when it was going on.

170
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,410
How many marijuana is
does it take to overdose?

171
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,660
Jamie, send me that. Send me that.

172
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:06,630
That is a fucking amazing quote.
Did she really say that?

173
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,900
No, no, no. It's a Twitter user. They
put, people were tweeting whatever.

174
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,460
Hashtag pot to blame. Oh my God. The
Twitter, the Twitter user. Oh, styler.

175
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,500
Tyler 2015 it says, oh
Tyler. 2015 dude that,

176
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,810
but it's 2015 the day of the tweet. It
must be nice probably just as an account,

177
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,760
but I don't know when it happens.

178
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,930
It's a weird time dealt with is a space
in there so that don't well, yeah,

179
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,410
I think 2015 well whether,
I dunno, I dunno. Yeah,

180
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,160
whoever's, whoever that
is, congratulations. Made
me laugh my ass off. Yeah.

181
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,990
That's funny. But yeah, that's what I love
is a ridiculous lady. You know, she's,

182
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,790
she obviously wasn't that healthy,
you know, she wasn't, uh, a very, uh,

183
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,630
fit health conscious person
just worrying about weed.

184
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,040
She's a crazy person. She was like
Paula Dean, but she couldn't cook food.

185
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,550
Marijuana, Moon. It's going to
kill you. Rolling Fund chills.

186
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,870
People still like that.

187
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,790
There's a lot of people like
that in the middle of the country

188
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,600
and then the middle of the country,
sometimes it's still like, you know,

189
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,490
there's the last thing might
have been racially, you know,

190
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,290
depends on they get the soccer we'd moms
and everybody was like, oh, that's cool.

191
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,030
And then you still get that.

192
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:19,700
Like I did a podcast the other day
and the first comments were like,

193
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,430
either your years, two stones
you're not doing. I was like, no,

194
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,780
I just did a bad job. You know, like
I could have just done a bad job.

195
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:27,360
It didn't have any they they

196
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,700
need to do with me being in stone.
Yeah.

197
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:33,060
Like they know that if you were sober
the podcast would have been way better.

198
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,950
Yeah. You were sober man. You would
have been so weird. It's true.

199
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,790
It's all true. I used to have to go to
this place to Inglewood wellness center,

200
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,170
so it was kind of in a hood
area. Um, a little bit sketchy.

201
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,730
And then a while we're going there,
like within a year or two later,

202
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,570
the guy who ran it got
shot and robbed there.

203
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,240
That's how dangerous weed was.
Cause he had to do it all in cash.

204
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,870
They wouldn't let banks use checks,
it wouldn't know,

205
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,420
wouldn't accept checks and credit cards.
So everything was weird.

206
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,250
Even though it was
medical and it was legal.

207
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:08,770
You had to get it through nefarious ways.

208
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,460
And then slowly but surely
the stigma started to erase.

209
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,790
Yeah.
Now you can just go to a store on Melrose.

210
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,300
Yes. So like what, how do you feel,

211
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,230
you're wise man?
How do you feel I should have qualified?

212
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:26,600
That felt like neat.
I'm setting you up.

213
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,170
What do you think about
making all drugs legal?

214
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:31,970
Do you think that that would ever happen?

215
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,270
And given what we know about prohibition,
it sounds like an interview,

216
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,700
given what we know about prohibition,

217
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,740
like how bad it was for alcohol
and how it popped up, the, uh,

218
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,150
organized crime and I mean
it caused a lot of problems.

219
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,740
Do you think it would be a wise
thing to make all drugs legal?

220
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,950
That's a tough question

221
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,370
for me. I think that's, um,
I think you have to start,

222
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:58,400
I guess that's really trying to give
people a lot of credit about their

223
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,440
intelligence and their decision making.
Right.

224
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:02,210
And that's what you're trying
to lead towards, that the,

225
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,800
that the individual was
very intelligent and they,

226
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:06,680
they're gonna make their
decision no matter what.

227
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:10,250
And that by putting these stigmas who
are just like, you know, like you know,

228
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,930
prostitution and things like that, your
PR, you're just adding extra jail time,

229
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:19,730
extra obstacles, extra, um,
life threatening situation.

230
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,690
And you're also penalizing people for
their own life choices instead of propping

231
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:29,370
up organized crime or as well as where
they're pro propping up organized crime.

232
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,240
And if you've seen the effects of drug
addiction, which I've had on occasion,

233
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:38,320
you is hard to go like,
yeah, this should it be okay.

234
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:43,240
You know, I 100% agree. So
it's, it's not that clean.

235
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,310
No, I don't, they
didn't. That's why. Yeah,

236
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,260
that will be my answer is I
don't think it's that clean.

237
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,630
I think that it is a case by case basis.

238
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:53,260
We'll do I think marijuana
should be legal. I absolutely do.

239
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:56,950
I think that you should necessarily
legalize heroin. No, I don't think so.

240
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,990
I don't think so either.
Um, but I think that,

241
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,260
I think there's a real problem
with infants realizing adults.

242
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:06,551
The,

243
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:11,551
the real problem is like if you are 25
years old or older and you decide you

244
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:16,690
want to try cocaine, whose, whose, why,
why can they say you can't do that?

245
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,610
Why says who? So the
zoo, why is that? Why,

246
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,260
why have you catch me with that?
Can you put me in a jail?

247
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,920
It grows from the ground. It's a plant.
They take that plant, they process it.

248
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:30,380
They turned to cocaine.
They still use it legally for,

249
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,920
of and medical grade cocaine.

250
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,160
They still use it for
the flavor of Coca Cola.

251
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,040
They still use the leaves.
They still use the plant.

252
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,380
Like who says I don't even do coke.

253
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,370
But who the fuck do you think
is making money selling coke?

254
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,870
Cause there's a lot of coke.

255
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,160
It's one thing that's completely
why Miami exists. It's very,

256
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,360
no, it did. No other industry in
Miami and there's so much money there.

257
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,530
Did you see cocaine cowboys? Mm, no dude.

258
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,610
Billy Corbin, the guy who directed it
was on the podcast yesterday. He's a,

259
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,540
he's fantastic and he's got this new
book, um, documentary called screw ball.

260
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,710
It's about Alex Hernandez and steroids.
In baseball and all this crazy shit. Oh,

261
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,000
Brian Rodriguez, who's actioning does
this is a different one. Hey Rod.

262
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,740
How I say he is that
guy? No, that's Aaron.

263
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,450
That's new England patriot.

264
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,430
Scott. Dan Weeds. Fuck my head up.
That is the guy from the Patriots.

265
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,420
Aaron Hernandez. Oh, okay. That's why
I fucked it up. My apologies. Alex.

266
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,310
Alex Rodriguez and uh, anyway, this,

267
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,390
this guy made a documentary called cocaine
cowboys and it's all about how crazy

268
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,680
during the big cocaine days
Miami was and how one year,

269
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:47,510
the entire graduating class of the
sheriff's Academy, the Police Academy,

270
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,290
whatever it was,

271
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,180
they either were murdered or they
were arrested for corruption.

272
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,020
The whole, everyone, the entire class,

273
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,840
like the entire graduating year,
like every,

274
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:04,841
it was wild west chaos and there was
all these pilots bringing in millions of

275
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,990
dollars worth of coke and they had
bags of money buried in their backyard.

276
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,760
It's fucking crazy ass. Interesting.
It's great, man. It's great.

277
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,550
It's a two part series or it
says there's two parts to it too.

278
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,430
Do you ever do versus Black Mafia family?
You ever,

279
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,930
you ever watch any documentaries about
them? That makes me always interested.

280
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,090
What did they do?
They were a,

281
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:31,090
a cocaine outlet and the early two
thousands out of Atlanta and they transmit

282
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,300
that at one point they were running and
like most of the south southeast, um,

283
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,640
head by this dude named big Meech.
And um,

284
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,480
then they decided like we should
legalize and get into a rap,

285
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,620
but they had never done anything like
that before and they were very blatant

286
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,190
about it. So the, all of a sudden these
people who were came out of nowhere,

287
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:53,100
we're just all on like
every magazine. The, um,

288
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,030
they have this thing where
they're introduced interviewing
police officers and

289
00:16:57,031 --> 00:17:01,410
they had this big billboard when
you inland it Atlanta that would go,

290
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,170
that would just say BMF,
we own the world.

291
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,460
And they were just out there and they
would throw these big parties with tigers

292
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:12,330
and stuff and they only had one
recording artists. So it was just like,

293
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,200
they weren't good at pretending
not to be drug dealers. Wow.

294
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,920
So it's very interesting you're saying

295
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,510
to me, well that whole,
um, ramp businessman,

296
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,540
I mean if you just stop and think about
rap music other than some country and I

297
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:33,100
mean really like a small amount of
country would talk about murder and men.

298
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,420
You know,

299
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,420
I shot a man in Reno just to
watch him and a few Johnny Cash,

300
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,170
maybe some Merle haggard, Waylon
Jennings, maybe some, some of those songs.

301
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,680
But when you get to like Nwa,

302
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,220
you have a different level

303
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,090
of aggression. You know, when you
get to a [inaudible] body count,

304
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,020
when he was doing that hard metal shed
new soon fuck the police or uh, uh, um,

305
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,780
I'm a cop killer. I mean, it's either Nwa
fuck the police or ice teas. I'm a cop.

306
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:06,020
Koeuch you hear those? Like you'd never
heard of anything like that before.

307
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,430
Yeah, though the interest in time, because
that's, I mean, talking about real anger,

308
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:11,181
when we talked about before,

309
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:15,860
this is all coming from real places
and people who were Dylan Wa,

310
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,060
you know, Los Angeles at a horrible
time in, in La police corruption.

311
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,080
And then what's crazy is in you,
it goes the other way, right?

312
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:27,770
They take that real anger that people
connect it to and then they just started

313
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:31,520
manufacturing it and then wrap becomes
all these fake stories of like,

314
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:35,520
I murdered all these people. I
have all this money and, and,

315
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:40,520
and then now it's just so far gone
that it, it, it's hard to find.

316
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,660
I mean now my favorite authentic rap is
like people who are like, Oh, you know,

317
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,910
I can't find my wifi password or

318
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,510
are people just talking about raising
their kids now I love that and rap cause

319
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,830
then I'm like, oh, you're for real.

320
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,730
Yeah. Why not talk about anything.
You know, today was a good day,

321
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,150
right? I mean that was like one
of the original ones, right?

322
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,220
They used to be a song called
all you could eat, which
was Joe about go into off.

323
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,770
But like today was a good day.

324
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,360
I mean is that is like a classic example
of someone taking the art form and

325
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:20,361
completely switching it up and slowing
it down and make it casual and relaxed

326
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,310
and celebrate Tori.
And that's from the same dude.

327
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,990
Same Dude from Nwa. Nan
Smart Man, smart man.

328
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,530
He's a wizard of a writer to is,
his lyrics are fantastic.

329
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,310
You know there's like when there's lyrics
in my mind when it comes to hip hop,

330
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,940
there's lyrics and there's Nas.

331
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,980
Nas does shit that you just go
like that backwards song, you know,

332
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,380
he's just call it cause like
everything is. So it's like a,

333
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,370
like a practice like orchestra,
you know,

334
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:55,110
as opposed to just being rhymes. Like
it's sometimes he puts things together.

335
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,170
So, so interestingly, you know,

336
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:01,770
he's got his own special sort
of appreciation for things.

337
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,940
Yeah. He's also very smart man. He has
to be, he was the one that he won best.

338
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,150
He invests a lot of tech companies.
He does a lot of, he's begging

339
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,710
the investments.
Why is young twenties when he wrote that?

340
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,380
He's like 23 when that song came out.
That's incredible.

341
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,090
His Dad was like a jazz musician.

342
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,950
So I think he grew up around the culture
of creating things and being an artist.

343
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,030
He's got that feel to him.
He's like a hybrid, you know,

344
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,130
in terms of it's like jazzy rap sort of.
You know what I mean?

345
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:30,931
Like there's something to,

346
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:35,931
it was like almost like a
classical trained musician slash.

347
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,470
Rapper in terms of like how he
constructs things. Yeah. Like Hamilton.

348
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,930
I didn't see Hamilton.
Did you see it?

349
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,190
No, I am but allow people once
anything where a lot of light

350
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,970
that mayfly, why people get into a
rap. I go, they probably not for me.

351
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,940
Oh, I want to know any
rap about the presidents.

352
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,770
This one thing that like white guys have
managed to infiltrate certain elements

353
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:02,950
of,

354
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,950
but like it's such a small number of
like legitimately respected white rappers

355
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,500
was a number M and. M of
course. Yeah, for sure.

356
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,910
Kid Rock in a way.
He's kind of a rapper even though he,

357
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:20,710
does she respect the rapper?
No, no, no. But it's fun.

358
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,240
Yeah. It's excepted. Mc Sir
Macklemore Mc Mc search was great.

359
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,920
I used to love them. I used to
love third base. There were fun.

360
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,500
Everlast BC boy Everlast for sure,

361
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:36,010
but Everlast has changed
and now wraps occasionally.

362
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,950
I would think he would call himself
more of a musician now. Jump around.

363
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,750
He's still jumping around. Still
jump around. Well, not only that,

364
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:47,710
the last shit that they put out was
great to let stuff that he came in and

365
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:51,040
showed us and he did some stuff
with be real and some other guys.

366
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,110
What do they call it?
What was his last project?

367
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,560
Shout out to that project. We'll find
it. Jamie would find it. He's a shit,

368
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,270
but like a
or porn industry.

369
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,190
That's right. War Porn Industry's.
That's preposterous. Crazy name. Oh, hi.

370
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:13,490
Do you have to be to come up with that
name? Action Bronson. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

371
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,960
Albanian. Oh, Action Bronson. Yeah, dude,

372
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,680
I've never seen a man smoke more
weed in my life. It never seen it.

373
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,410
He just keeps going like
he just ha hey man, look,

374
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:27,050
we took a picture of the ash tray after
it was over show all the, all the, uh,

375
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,390
expired blunt, but I was like, this is,
he's from that fuck. That's delicious.

376
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,930
Show you ever watch that. I'm a big
action prompts and fan. Do you allow them?

377
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:38,260
He's so interesting to me. Do you watch
the cooking show? Sometimes. Yeah.

378
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,210
It's interesting, right? Like that that
guy was a like a legit chef. Yeah. Yeah.

379
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,010
And Matt and then just that.
He's a great rapper.

380
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,570
Great Chef. A great personality.
Super Nice guy selling paintings now.

381
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,270
Good for him. Sell it for $1 billion.
That's $1 billion. You fucks.

382
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,920
That's 2 billion.
That's amazing.

383
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,890
That's a rug where a lot of weed bearings
on it. Get that money. Action Bronson.

384
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,270
Get that money. Yeah, man. I'm all for
people selling the most ridiculous shit.

385
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,080
I went to my agent's house once.
He had this dope place in Aspen.

386
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:18,630
I mean this place was
crazy. Like, you know,

387
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,780
Aspen houses like near the ski lodges
and Shit and on the wall he had this

388
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,530
painting and I said, I go,
did this kid make this? And
they go, no, that's a little,

389
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,680
you know, some fucking obscure
popular artists. I go, what is that?

390
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,740
And they like, this is a really
expensive piece of shut the fuck up.

391
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:39,190
You're messing with me. They're
like, no. It was like tissue paper.

392
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,450
There was like different colors.

393
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:43,890
It was stuck with glue and look a little
piece of paper and some paint on it and

394
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:46,970
like, get the fuck Outta
here with this. Like,

395
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:51,670
what are you doing with that cannon
camera? I mean, what the parade? No,

396
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,840
no, that's why I was stunned. I thought it
was his kid. I thought this kid made it.

397
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,810
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm just
dumb by definitely was, but
a younger and dumber, maybe.

398
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:06,770
I'd appreciate it now, but I
don't think so. I appreciate, uh,

399
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,830
all kinds of art.
I appreciate distorted things,

400
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:13,850
but I don't appreciate like just a bunch
of Splat, you know what I mean? Look,

401
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:17,330
it's gotta have something to it.
Like Jackson Pollock,

402
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:22,040
stuff like that stuff weirds me out. I
was like, why is it so expensive? Like,

403
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,490
I get it. I got it. You mean it's
crazy. It's definitely crazy.

404
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,250
But then you look at, you
know, you look a classic like,

405
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,890
uh, look at, uh, you know, some frank
Frazetta stuff. Do you know who that guy,

406
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,300
he was a, a fantasy painter homie from
the 19th. There's a poster of his,

407
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:46,280
or I'm a print of one of his works out
in the lobby that Conan the barbarian one

408
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,470
with that, uh, that monster it,
he's got a sword. He was, uh,

409
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,500
this guy that do, he would do all the
covers for Conan the barbarian books,

410
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,900
just incredible artwork, like
wild, crazy fantasy shit.

411
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,170
And this is your type of art. Oh,
just, I loved it when I was a kid, man,

412
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,800
when I was a kid. You
know, when I was a young,

413
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,980
this seems like what you would
like. I loved it. It was the best.

414
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,630
His books are incredible.

415
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:15,530
There's Robert Howard was this
really tortured guy who was, um,

416
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,370
a guy who lived with his
mom. He had, you know,

417
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,280
fairly poor health and he died
suicide when he was like 36 years old.

418
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,730
But he wrote a bunch of these books
about a guy that was nothing like him.

419
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:33,620
They've got a guy who was this just
unstoppable force of nature from this.

420
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,090
He created this place called, uh, was
Sumeria. We know what going to call it.

421
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,830
What was his Samarian? It was Samarian.
Is that what it was? We're Kona,

422
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,990
Kona in the Sumerian,
right.

423
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,120
See [inaudible] created a whole
world and in this world there's like,

424
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:52,310
it was like very games of throne.
He in a lot of ways,

425
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:56,330
the original shit like no one to this
day is really captured the books in a

426
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:56,691
movie.

427
00:25:56,691 --> 00:26:01,460
Like Arnold was fun as Conan and then
Jason Momoa was like a better fit

428
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,050
physically.
He was like a perfect fit.

429
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:06,500
Physically more realistic as
opposed to like being a bodybuilder.

430
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:10,760
But nobody's ever captured like the
feeling of the books because the books is

431
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:11,990
just some wild shit.

432
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:14,930
And it was all created by this
one guy was like super depressed.

433
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,310
They're just write these books about
this guy who just fucked all these women

434
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:23,180
and killed everyone and just we'll just
smashed his way through the world and

435
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,700
power fan and things
like crazy shit though.

436
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:30,230
It was all him fighting
dragons and monsters and
demons coming for his soul and

437
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:33,570
he ran for 72 hours and
fight them off with a sword.

438
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:37,430
And this would just quit when you're 12
years old like I was and I got into this

439
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:41,660
shit. He'd be like, Whoa, this
is why I get that as like,

440
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:46,661
well ECW wrath was from me cause they
was like titties everywhere and violence

441
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:50,710
and blood and nails. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,040
Cause I watched one
yesterday on Instagram.

443
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:56,910
Somebody had a clip of a guy and a girl
and they're in the middle of the rain,

444
00:26:56,911 --> 00:27:00,660
the guys making out with the girl and
then it turns on their body slams are down

445
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,710
to the ground. And I was like, well you
could still do that and pro wrestling,

446
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,300
you could still fake like fake violence
against a check. I didn't know. Yeah.

447
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,550
Oh yeah. Energetic arrest still. They
obey. They slam, they fake slam chicks.

448
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,410
That is crazy. I saw him do that. I was
like, that could not have felt good.

449
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,430
I lady stuck a blow pop up a
dude's butt recently. Oh No, he,

450
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,040
he didn't want it.
What is this about his deck?

451
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,730
He carried when you carry around
blow pop, I guess, you know. Wow.

452
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,900
Jesus Christ. Just Rathlin. Well,

453
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,120
whatever you got to do
to sell them tickets.

454
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,560
What is this Jeremy? This is the
blow pop thing. No Way. Oh my God.

455
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:50,160
He's really sticking it
up his ass in his mouth.

456
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,900
Oh my God.

457
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:54,840
And then decide ticks him in the face
and the guy's got his pants down.

458
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,240
Wait a minute. That might be the
greatest video I've ever seen in my life.

459
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,730
The same guy who did the like
the, you hit the deck. Shari.

460
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,780
Right? This beached great white
shark. That's crazy. Fuck.

461
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:14,220
That's crazy. I can't show it. The
shark was chasing a seagull. Oh,

462
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,380
you can't show it and accidentally
ended up in the beach.

463
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,180
Why don't these guys grab
it and pull it back in?

464
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:22,350
The fucking matter man is watching you.
Oh my God.

465
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:26,520
The guy's throwing water on it.
Just grab it. You just grab it.

466
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,340
They don't know. Oh, how do they
not know that's dead? It's dead now.

467
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,420
They can only last outside. Oh, it's
still still breathing a little bit.

468
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:41,670
That is crazy. That is an
ancient fucking feeding machine.

469
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,740
Look at the face on that thing,
man.

470
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,030
Just stop and think about what a
mother fucking nightmare the ocean is.

471
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,370
What a nightmare. Things like that. It
just roaming around and US assholes.

472
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,280
We think of being spiritual. Hey Man,
I'm just going to get out of my board.

473
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,430
I'm just going to get on my
board, be monster food. No,

474
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:02,280
I put my foot in the back out.

475
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,900
I'm such a pussy when it
comes to the ocean. I was in
Hawaii, we went snorkeling,

476
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,600
dive with the water and you staring down
and it was cool. We were by this reef,

477
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,940
but all I was thinking is I just need
one of these motherfuckers and I'm never

478
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:17,980
getting in this water again.
One of those motherfuckers.

479
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,170
I kind of want to do that now.
I couldn't,

480
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,840
I was too heavy before I was past the
weight limit that you could go do some

481
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:25,610
dive in.

482
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,860
Did you and I would always tell myself
I didn't want to do it by not want to do

483
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:32,910
that. Yeah. You could tell yourself
a lot of things, right? Yeah.

484
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,110
Mitch Michener a joke
about a writing that, uh,

485
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,290
when he gets the wrong idea,
he writes things down or

486
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,190
if he's lazy, he, yeah.

487
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,850
Not that funny.
How did you lose the weight?

488
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,920
Um,
I really just change them.

489
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,550
I got a trainer that was a big part of
it and just changed my diet and, um,

490
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,060
started exercising budget.

491
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:03,500
Went from a guy who didn't exercise
it all an eight multiple Philly cheese

492
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:08,380
steaks a day to a guy who eats a bunch
of boneless skinless chicken breast and

493
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,440
protein shakes. And now I work out
like six times a day. Wow. Yeah.

494
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,740
Just seemed like I was
going to die if I did.

495
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,480
So what do you do for
working out these days?

496
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,070
Uh, you know, low weight lifting, a lot
of 'em I don't see the day to, you know,

497
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,070
just love back a little,
a little biceps, you know,

498
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,120
one arm rolls and whatnot.
Just general weightlifting.

499
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,080
So, but you're, you do it a lot.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you, um,

500
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,170
do you find has an effect on your mood on
how you feel? Oh, absolutely. How do you,

501
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,920
how much better do you feel and how much
do you attribute it to the working out,

502
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:45,150
the losing weight or both of them

503
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,560
gathering? It's a combination,
definitely the, um, the Diet and,

504
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:54,520
and just feeling better nutrition wise is,
it is very helpful.

505
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,270
Um, but you know, just doing
two shows a night now, you know,

506
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,380
they used to be a thing for me.

507
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,240
I used to be like really tired
afterwards and now, you know, no problem.

508
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,450
I do a lot of um,
voiceovers and,

509
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:10,030
and other little things. And so, you know,

510
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:13,150
I'm always bouncing around from going
like doing shows in the weekend.

511
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:16,690
They'd come home and then having to go
do voiceover on Monday morning and taking

512
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:20,620
care of my son and helping him with his
homework and just being able to do that

513
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,970
and not being like, oh, I'm just, I got
to go pass out. I'm tired. You know?

514
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,800
That's the really the,
the biggest deal.

515
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,730
Being able to take on more so than
I'm able to, um, make more money.

516
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,310
So I was carrying my daughter
around my shoulders the other day.

517
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,230
She likes to get carried
around. She's 63 pounds and, uh,

518
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,950
while she's on my shoulders, uh, after,
you know, 40 minutes or so of that,

519
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:46,370
like it's fucking rough.
Like it starts really hurting your neck,

520
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:50,030
start getting really tired. And I had to
put her down and uh, I was thinking like,

521
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:51,150
how crazy is that though?

522
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,100
There's a lot of people that just carry
that much extra around with them all the

523
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:55,934
time.

524
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,380
They're always carrying around an extra
60 pounds and you don't think it's that

525
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:05,240
much of a deal until you don't have it
and then you walk with it. Yeah. You know,

526
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:08,660
and you realize like, and it's
this like, even if it's not that,

527
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,370
like when a kid sitting on your neck,

528
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:14,510
it's not like the ideal place to carry
all the weight. They actually make a, um,

529
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,500
a thing.
There's a company called the outdoorsman.

530
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,780
They make a thing called the atlas pack.
It's like a backpack frame.

531
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,070
But at the back of it is like one of
those weightlifting posts so you could

532
00:32:25,071 --> 00:32:29,360
slide in Olympic a barbell or a
Olympic played on and two plates.

533
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,040
You put as much as 90 pounds on it,

534
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:34,310
clamp this thing down and then
it's sitting more on your hips.

535
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,200
It's way easier to carry,
but even that still it's fuck,

536
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,130
it's fucking man walking around

537
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,650
with just 45 extra pounds on your back.
Sucks.

538
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,830
Yeah, just getting, you know, just being
like my mid thirties and being like,

539
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,680
oh man, my knees are hurting. I
didn't, I never played football.

540
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,110
I never did anything like that.
My knees shouldn't be hurting and,

541
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,120
and just knowing,
I think I had to just change a,

542
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,500
just changed my mindset about like before
when I was just doing stand up to do

543
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:04,020
it and didn't think I was going to
be successful, it didn't matter.

544
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:07,620
I was just like, I'm this living Verdad
Day gimme free pizza, give me whatever.

545
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:11,160
And then I was like, once this things
started changing a little bit, I was like,

546
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,730
oh, I'm, things are happening. I still
don't even really know what I'm doing.

547
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,290
Let me, if I give myself a better
chance and take care of my health,

548
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:23,850
take care of my body, um, let me
see how far I can push these gift,

549
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:25,110
pushed these skills,
you know,

550
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,280
and it became more about not
wanting to waste the opportunity.

551
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,480
That's very cool. That's
cool. I liked that.

552
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:37,510
So your love of standup made you sort of
concentrate even more on your own body.

553
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,880
Yeah. That crazy. Yeah. Like
not your love of yourself,

554
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,520
not your love of your body.
Like of course like this is,

555
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,290
you have to go through number
of what you do in your life.

556
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,460
You're going through it with your body,

557
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,790
but it was your love of
stand up to me like, God,

558
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:55,520
I gotta do something about this
fucking body. Yeah. That crazy.

559
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,750
Yeah. Low stand up alone, my son and
we'll love of fashion and I didn't,

560
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:03,980
you know, when you get to
certain size all your shares,

561
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,220
good dogs on them and you know,
I want that anymore.

562
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,990
Yeah. Right. Yeah. It gets you
getting to that triple XL. I,

563
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:18,310
I'm happy whenever anybody does anything
that, uh, that benefits their health,

564
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,380
whether it's a for whatever your
motivation, the end result is always good.

565
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,860
It's always good no matter what
motivations, positive or negative.

566
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:31,120
If you want to prove somebody wrong,
you know, or you just want to do,

567
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,320
just do better. Just have a
better path, you know? So it's so,

568
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,690
it's so attainable for so many people.

569
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,720
So many people could at
least be way healthier.

570
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,070
At least have way more
energy at least like that.

571
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,260
Not that feeling of just
being like, Ugh, all day.

572
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:51,870
And every time I cheat like a
with burgers and fries and, and,

573
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:53,530
and like milkshakes and shit like that.

574
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:58,330
If I really go off the deep end
with my diet, I feel like dog shit,

575
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,860
I feel terrible. It hits me. I'm like, oh.

576
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,940
And then you've got to realize,
hey man,

577
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:05,530
this is how a lot of
people feel all the time.

578
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,450
Yeah. That's a big deal
for me. The same thing,

579
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,400
just going off a half a burger and,

580
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,760
and was feeling so sick. And then I was
like, man, I used to live like this.

581
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:21,570
Every meal and my body, you
know, is, is just the, you know,

582
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,930
testament of what your body is capable
to adapt to, you know. But, um,

583
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,790
once you start going the other way
and started really getting healthy,

584
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:32,540
you really in your body
becomes more sensitive to it
and you really are like, oh,

585
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:37,070
I prefer not to cheat. You know?
Yeah. You still got to have that.

586
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,460
You've got to have fun.

587
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,220
There's nothing wrong with an ice cream
or something like that every now and

588
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:42,600
again or some sort of a dessert.

589
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,670
But really it's the,

590
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,780
they just think that your body has to
be accustomed to getting what it needs.

591
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,710
That's what it is. And for too many
people that running on nutrition deficit,

592
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,610
so when your body's just not getting it,
what it needs for long periods of time,

593
00:35:56,611 --> 00:36:00,480
then you develop chronic inflammation
and all sorts of other problems.

594
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,340
And this is what people are really
suffering from. You know, you're, there's,

595
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:07,860
they're suffering from a
nutritional deficiency that's
probably lasted for years.

596
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:12,300
They probably never did it. You know,
some people, they just, they go 10,

597
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:16,110
15, 20 years without even thinking about
their dying. There's eating dog shit.

598
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,470
You just eating stuff that doesn't have
enough nutrients and your body just

599
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,690
starts to get weaker.
There's no way around it.

600
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:25,610
And if you just just turn
that starting salads,

601
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,920
eating a healthy fish
and, and, and you know,

602
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:33,360
some healthy meat and just take some
vitamins. It takes a vitamin supplements,

603
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,930
real simple, you know, slot and just
get yourself some multivitamins,

604
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,990
give yourself like a little thing of
athletic Greens or something that get,

605
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,910
get your fucking health online.
And once you do, he'd be like,

606
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,660
Oh,
I've just,

607
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,850
how much better this is all I had
to do and I'm this person now.

608
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,690
Yeah. Mentally. So much better. Much
clearer, much happier. Much happier.

609
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,860
It's so hard though,

610
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:01,600
cause we love mouth pleasure
like [inaudible] you know,

611
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:04,900
but to the point where
people were poisoning their
bodies to get mouth pleasure.

612
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,080
Yeah. And it's just, you know,
constantly pushed in your face.

613
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:11,920
Everybody always knows. We talk about
all the tie in on the cheeseburgers,

614
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:14,740
50 cents salad, like five, $6. You know,

615
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,260
is you have to make that effort.

616
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:21,580
You have to be able to want to cook at
home and it's not, it's not made easy.

617
00:37:21,581 --> 00:37:26,020
And that's what I think,
um, we become as a society,

618
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:30,700
less cool and less appreciative of effort,

619
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,040
you know? Yeah. But there's also,

620
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:36,250
there's something really annoying about
people that want you to eat healthy.

621
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,263
Yeah.

622
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,760
That to get off your high horse.
Oh Fuck Outta here.

623
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,090
If you're sitting there and you're having
a burger and fries and enjoying the

624
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:50,200
shit out of it and some asshole next
use got Kale was shaved pecans and

625
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,870
talking shit about your diet while
they're pouring fresh olive oil on top of

626
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:59,290
their shitty salad. C'Mon
man. Leave me alone.

627
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,030
You know, even a little wine or enjoy
something gross. Yeah. Taste around.

628
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:10,270
I think as long as the, the majority
of your diet is really healthy,

629
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,210
then you can get in those fuck off days.
It doesn't matter.

630
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,590
Your body will bounce back. Just
don't, don't put it in a deficit.

631
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,320
That's the whole key. And that's
where I'm coming from. And that's,

632
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,400
that's why I had to,

633
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,710
I have to keep reminding myself cause
I get frustrated when I'm at the,

634
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:29,620
like these parties or whatever and
see, you know, there's food everywhere,

635
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,200
craft everywhere.
And I'm like,

636
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:36,190
I have to stay on focus on his diet
cause I'm like, I, you know, I'm 36 now

637
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:41,190
and I want to make sure that I'm at
my healthiest and then I returned as

638
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,850
devastate when I'm 40.
You know,

639
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:47,851
because when the natural aging process
cakes and I don't want to be like kicking

640
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:51,670
off still being, you know, two
30 to 200, hundred and 20 pounds,

641
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:55,810
I want to be like 200 and be able
to coast and be a hot old man.

642
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,900
Hot old man.
Yes.

643
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,070
Because it's also way easier
to maintain is less true. Yeah.

644
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,360
Um,

645
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,360
it's way easier to maintain two than
it is to like if you're in your 50s and

646
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:11,760
then you start working out then
is hard. It's really hard. Like,

647
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:13,410
it's hard for me when I get out of shape,

648
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,570
like if I get hurt or something like that
and I take a couple weeks off, that's,

649
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,480
you feel it. Like whoa. It's way
harder to bounce back. Way Hard.

650
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:23,010
Like twice as hard as it
was when I was younger.

651
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:28,010
Like you gotta be disciplined it down
the horse. Yeah. Stay on a horse.

652
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,050
That's what I've been trying to

653
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,840
do now is um, I think, you
know, when you're younger,
twenties teens or whatever,

654
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:37,270
you don't want to listen to anybody
saying those things. And now I'm like, I,

655
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,440
I'm starting to listen when someone I
know in one of my friends are 50 or older

656
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:45,300
and they're like, hey, you need
to do this now because yeah.

657
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,810
One cheat meal for me
is two weeks of work.

658
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,580
Yeah. Yeah. Um,

659
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:57,390
do you do anything like
athletic that's fun? Like, uh,

660
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,250
that's one way to get good workouts. And
like if you play a game, you like, tennis.

661
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,090
Tennis is a very fast paced, people
like doing that gives them a good car.

662
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,860
Like Callans and tennis. Boxing
counts in a boxing too. Like anything,

663
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:12,530
meaning we don't have to box a
person and I don't recommend you do,

664
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,990
but just hitting a bag. It's like,
it's really satisfying too. Yeah.

665
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,340
I've been interested in
getting in the boxing. I um,

666
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,850
I tried some pro wrestling for a little
bit. I went to a pro wrestling school.

667
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,870
Yeah. What about, have you ever
thought about actual grappling,

668
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,930
like taking Jujitsu or get hurt easily?

669
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,000
Well, you could, but you're a smart guy.

670
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,750
I think you'd figure it out
pretty quickly. It's, it's,

671
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:41,900
it's a very unusual thing
because, um, you think of people,

672
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,970
like if you thought of someone who does,
does Jujitsu, you'd think like, oh,

673
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,610
like a jockish type person.

674
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,970
But the majority of them that
are really good are really nerds.

675
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,770
That's what I've met a couple.
Okay.

676
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,650
People and they all like,
um, they're similar to me.

677
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:56,450
They're just kind of like the other
side. I mean, we were like, oh,

678
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:59,960
you like comic books and Video Games too.
You just beat people up.

679
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,430
Well, they don't beat people
up. They tried to strangle
him. But when I say nerd,

680
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:07,220
I mean, I mean it with all due
respect that there, you know,

681
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:10,700
cause I'm a nerd and a lot of ways
with some things, but they, they're um,

682
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,460
they're very like Jujitsu geeks.

683
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,450
They're like people that are
obsessed with uh, anything else,

684
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:22,451
whether it's music or video
games or they become obsessed,

685
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:26,720
but they're doing it in the physical
way that requires you to have a deep

686
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:28,370
understanding of all the potential moves.

687
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,940
It's very complicated in terms
of like your ability to when you,

688
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:34,310
when you're rolling with someone,
say if I roll

689
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,190
with a guy and I know he's like a brown
belt or a black belt or something like

690
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:38,024
that,
I'm,

691
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,870
we're having an argument or conversation
with techniques and the more of a

692
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:47,510
vocabulary you have and the stronger your
use of those words are as particularly

693
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:50,450
the basic words, the better your
chance of winning the argument.

694
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,111
That's what it's like.

695
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:56,111
Almost like this really complicated debate
with physical leverage and they feel

696
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:02,990
like that kind of reminds
me of your style. It. Um,

697
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,360
it definitely,
like,

698
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,250
it's like a lot of what I try to
do is like figure things out in a,

699
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:12,620
in a joke form. Right. I'll try.
Like, what, why is that? What's that?

700
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:17,720
So like that's what I've been trying
to do over the last few years,

701
00:42:17,721 --> 00:42:20,480
I think.
So in that sense it is kind of similar.

702
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,800
That's cause you're trying
to figure something out. Like
it's, it's like a puzzle.

703
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,920
Like there's, I know there's some
juice in this puzzle, like, how do I,

704
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,180
how do I turn this into a bit? Why
do I think this is funny? Like,

705
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:36,710
what do I think I can say out of this?
That's funny. And also people go,

706
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,240
Oh yeah, Huh, hmm. You know, and if I
could do that. And so in that sense, yeah,

707
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:44,840
it's Kinda like, it's, but it's
also, it's very human. It's humbling.

708
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,910
It's very humbling because you
getting strangled and like you just,

709
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,820
you lose in power. He also just know,
you know, like my uh, instructors, uh,

710
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:59,450
John Jacques Machado, he says very famous
Jujitsu black belt, world champion,

711
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,420
Super Nice Guy,
one of the nicest guys in the planet.

712
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,450
But every time I grapple with
him, it's just like a, uh,
it's a matter of time for,

713
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,900
he catches me with something.
It's just,

714
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:12,020
it's not whether or not I'm ever going
to catch him. That's not going to happen.

715
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,780
This is just a total different world and
a lot of that is his deep knowledge and

716
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:21,470
understanding something
and you being a smart guy,

717
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,760
I think you'd get into it especially cause
you love pro wrestling. So I was like,

718
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:30,761
there's like you have at least you have
a mindset for watching guys do things to

719
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:34,250
each other and manipulate each other,

720
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:37,010
which is half of what's exciting
about pro wrestling. Right?

721
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:39,950
Some guy pulling off some crazy move.
Even if it's orchestrated,

722
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:44,170
it's still a crazy thing that these guys
are pulling off on each other. I mean I,

723
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,190
I liked Mr Cause then I'm like,

724
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,710
oh they're friends and they
worked this out together.

725
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:53,330
My problem is I know they're getting
hurt and then not even really fighting.

726
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,930
Right. I mean they're, it's,
they're hitting each other for sure.

727
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,300
They're doing things to each other and
slamming each other. It's all real.

728
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,470
But those guys get banged
up and they do it way more.

729
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,380
So if you're watching the guy
who's fighting in the UFC,

730
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:08,600
they have practices that they can control.

731
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,640
So if they know that they
have a hurt, uh, you know,

732
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,490
back or a hurt foot, you know, they'll put
shit in ins to have pads on. They won't,

733
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,383
they won't kick.

734
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,110
They'll do things where they work around
whatever injury they have when they're

735
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:25,010
in the camp. You can't do that when
dudes are throwing you. There's some,

736
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:29,090
you've got a bad back and some guy's
fucking picking you up and bang. Oh,

737
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:32,410
they will. You know, they'll look
just swept. They will do. But I,

738
00:44:32,411 --> 00:44:37,080
I do really like your point about, um,
these, they can take some time off,

739
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:41,490
I'm sure. Yeah. They can definitely
make an agreement with each other. Hey,

740
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,390
don't slam in my back is fucked.
But those guys get beat the fuck up.

741
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,920
Talking to a Dallas page and Jake the
snake to guys that have had on the

742
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:54,330
podcast, which were, they were
amazing and especially Jake stories.

743
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:58,920
Fucking crazy man. When he tells
you his story and what a nice guy,

744
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:00,990
big giant,
nice man,

745
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:06,210
like just genuinely friendly and happy
that everything's going well for him now.

746
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,070
Crazy. But that's a rough
business is my point. Like I,

747
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,090
I'm way rather like real uh,
grappling.

748
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,800
Like I feel like real grappling for like
if it was going to tell a person like

749
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,010
what would be safer for your body?
I think pro wrestling is harder.

750
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:28,200
I think it's harder on you. I can see
that they don't, they get saw, wham,

751
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,000
you watch some of that stuff.

752
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:34,260
No one wants you to know now about brain
damage and knowing what you know now

753
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:38,400
about that it's not even concussions
necessarily as much as it's sub concussive

754
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:41,910
trauma that doesn't knock you unconscious,
but just rattles your fucking head.

755
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:46,080
And the repeated impacts of those. Yeah.
Those guys are getting that all the time.

756
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,540
Yeah. All the time. Yeah. No,

757
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:52,170
I go back and sometimes that why some
older wrath land and it really makes me

758
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:54,000
cringe because they got a
lot of guys could take it in.

759
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,750
All these chairs shots straight to
the face. Straight to the face. Yeah.

760
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,070
It's all kinked.
Ken Shamrock,

761
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:03,360
take this one to the head that
sounded like a gunshot. It was crazy.

762
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,280
Dude. What is it about people
getting smacked in the head? Um,

763
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:12,450
Thompson girl has been sending me
these Russians slap championships,

764
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,620
his videos. Have you seen
this shit? Oh my God.

765
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:19,920
These guys stand in front of each
other and smack each other in the face.

766
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:24,030
Full clip.
But some of them are doing a terrible job.

767
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,390
They're hitting with their finger and
left finger. They're getting fingers.

768
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:32,540
And then there's other guys
that are basically doing
like a ridge hand strike to

769
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:33,780
your neck.

770
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,340
They're clipping guys on the chin
like this and they fall through it.

771
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:39,570
It looks like a slap.

772
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,470
But this is not a slap this,

773
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,580
this is like a karate chop there.

774
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:48,410
They're like going like that
to the head and then it turns,

775
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,680
I mean it's way harder.

776
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:53,280
And then some guys are doing like
a boss route and palm strike.

777
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,570
They're hitting like this.

778
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,390
There's the doing like a right
hook to the head like that.

779
00:46:57,391 --> 00:47:00,540
It's brutal guys or get
knocked unconscious.

780
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,950
I like to see it but just
with like older black moms,

781
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,700
they used to be the dumbest thing ever.

782
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,480
It was called like x arm and they would
take these guys arms together and let

783
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,430
them have an MMA fight.
What?

784
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,930
It was an MMA fight slash arm wrestling
competition and they were taped together.

785
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,490
It sounds so stupid. You can't
imagine that not only was it real,

786
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:30,550
but that the guy who created it was one
of the original creators of the UFC,

787
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,180
like it's such a crazy idea.
They just went for it, man, look,

788
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,660
they taped these people together.
Their arms are taped together.

789
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:41,620
They can't even move away and then
when they say go, they start fighting

790
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,570
and they get an arm bars. Sky
Floats. This guy's arm up, dude.

791
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:51,070
He broke his arm on the table 100% if
that guy keeps pulling on that thing,

792
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:53,950
he gets his arm snapped. Yeah, no,

793
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,450
I don't know if he actually
broke her right there,

794
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:57,730
but if the way the leverage of that table,

795
00:47:57,731 --> 00:48:01,030
because that guy's getting kicked in
the fucking head while he's tied to that

796
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:04,510
guy's arm. It's crazy. Pin His arm,

797
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:08,710
pinned his arm or Kao
him to win. What? What?

798
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,520
What didn't work? I mean it
didn't last. I can see why.

799
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:17,200
Just sub crazy people can get,
I love it dude. But that's real.

800
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,070
And how this is the other one. Chess.
Boxing. This is a legit one too.

801
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,820
I think they a box first and
then they play chess, right?

802
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,020
I think it goes back and forth.
Oh, they keep going back and forth.

803
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,680
That's a good move.
But seriously,

804
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:36,180
if you get out of the ring,
what if you get chaos?

805
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,820
Do you win if you win a chat?
Yeah.

806
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,270
Like if you win it chess,
but you get flat lined in 30 seconds.

807
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:47,560
Whew.
That's also be really fun.

808
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:50,990
If there is people who are horrible at
fight am but really good at test. Yeah.

809
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,500
And they would just lay down like you win,
you win this part.

810
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,630
I'm just here for the chest.
I know you guys suck at chess.

811
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,730
Why do they have headphones on
focus? You think so? Really?

812
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,510
While they're playing chess.
Oh, like to drown out the crowd.

813
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,280
Oh cause people would
probably say no to route.

814
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,670
It looks like the fight was first.
Yeah, there's sweat. By the way.

815
00:49:15,671 --> 00:49:17,590
Nights we're up to probably
isn't even a real move.

816
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,990
I just said some numbers and some letters.

817
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:25,770
I don't understand anything when it comes
to playing chess out loud was friends

818
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:29,020
with this guy that was
in prison in prison.

819
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:32,890
He learned how to play chess with
his words, you know, with uh,

820
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,280
it was just in his head.
And um,

821
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,670
he was at this place that we used
to play pool at in white plains.

822
00:49:39,671 --> 00:49:43,690
New York is called executive billiards,
a classic old school pool hall.

823
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,240
I think it's done now.
I think they,

824
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,150
they just closed it down
or something like that.

825
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:51,940
Maybe they're renovating or something.
But um,

826
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,120
this guy was playing with this kid who
was like a world champion chess player

827
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,470
and this kid would come by and play pool.

828
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:04,210
This really young kid like like 1516
years old and the two of them were sitting

829
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:07,150
there playing chess with each
other, like just saying, you know,

830
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:09,880
night to queen to or you know,
whatever the fuck it means.

831
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,300
And the guy would go stand there,
go a rook to six, blah blah blah.

832
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,090
And they would go back and forth
like this. I'd be like, I was like,

833
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:18,490
what are you imagining
what they're seeing?

834
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:19,780
Like what are they seeing in their head?

835
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,230
Or they seem like these things
move around in three dimensions.

836
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:24,670
Are they looking at it as a grid?

837
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:29,210
How are they keeping track
of where they're fucking
pieces are? It was humbling,

838
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:32,990
very humbling as it's just
strategic mind that I do not have.

839
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,450
What was interesting to me too,
cause it was a very young man.

840
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:40,130
I think it was like 23 or 24 I got to
see how fucking smart this guy was.

841
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:43,820
Yeti still wound up in prison. So
it was like, okay, like all right.

842
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:45,590
Just because someone's a criminal
doesn't mean they're stupid.

843
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:48,680
And just because someone smart doesn't
mean they won't go to jail. Absolutely.

844
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:52,790
Those are two things I saw
talking to that guy and uh, he,

845
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,740
he was in the middle of the game once and
he was gambling with this guy and this

846
00:50:57,741 --> 00:51:01,750
is the guy from prison who was like
Super Smart Guy, very sharp guy. And um,

847
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,970
he was talking to the guy who
was playing. He said, dude,

848
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,730
my wife told me if I don't get home by 10,

849
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:13,010
she wants a divorce and a 10 o'clock
rolls around and he yells out,

850
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,440
I guess I'm getting a divorce.

851
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,260
It's like two hours later and
he'd just racks the balls.

852
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:21,740
He was there till like two o'clock in the
morning. But it was hilarious. He just,

853
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:25,010
he, he said like as they started
playing it, my wife says,

854
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:29,780
if I don't come home by 10,
those are weird times, man.

855
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,670
Growing up, um, in a like
a, a suburb of Boston,

856
00:51:34,671 --> 00:51:37,970
which was a really nice place.
I grew up in this place called Newton,

857
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:38,930
like real quiet,

858
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:43,931
quaint little community to go from that
took the CD pool halls of New York was

859
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:48,140
really weird for me.
Very, very educational.

860
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,240
I got to see all these
like street hustlers,

861
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,270
I get to hang around with these guys,
be friends with a lot of homeless guys.

862
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:56,930
Like I had guys that were like a pool
players that wound up staying on my couch.

863
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,290
They had nowhere to go, you
know, a couple of them. And uh,

864
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:03,080
one of them who became my best friend,
this guy named Johnny,

865
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:08,320
but it was like we'd be in all these
weird places gambling like he's weird,

866
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:13,910
strange places with these guys who were
like these semi professional players

867
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,490
playing for hundreds,
thousands of dollars.

868
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,970
And it has to be a big crowd of guys
all gathered around. And B, one,

869
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:23,480
two in the morning. And I'd be thinking,
these guys, these are older than me. Men,

870
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:25,430
like they don't have families.
Like what did they do?

871
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:30,350
Like this is a whole separate culture, you
know? And you were in the underwear. Oh,

872
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:33,410
it was in a lot of ways, men, a lot
of ways. It was very underworldy.

873
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,040
I was obsessed with it to men.
I just wanted to play pool all the time.

874
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,700
I wasn't very good. Um, but the
guys I was around were very good.

875
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,650
I was around a lot of guys who are very,
very,

876
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:47,450
very good and you got to see like the
excitement of these. Uh, it was like,

877
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,560
it wasn't just excitement that everybody
was gathered around [inaudible] and

878
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:53,540
that they were playing this
game for a lot of money.

879
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:57,080
It was also the excitement
that we were bending the rules.

880
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:02,710
We're all just a bunch of men hanging
out at this smoky place at one o'clock in

881
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:06,470
the morning on a Wednesday and,
and everyone is in it together.

882
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:10,970
We're all just in some way
deranged derelicts, you know,

883
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:15,200
some Weirdos from society that can
figure their way to be able to be at this

884
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:17,480
place at one o'clock in the
morning on a Wednesday. Like,

885
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:20,810
why the fuck are you here man, I don't,
you have responsibilities. And no one,

886
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:23,480
there hadn't been responsibilities.
Everyone.

887
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:28,481
There was some sort of
either a professional gambler
or they had like some,

888
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:31,290
one of the guys was a fireman who would,
they would,

889
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,050
they would put them on these 24 hour
shifts and then we would have a couple of

890
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:37,470
days off and just come to pool hall
and hang out. Watch guys gamble.

891
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:42,570
I mean it sounds similar. Didn't stand
up. Oh yeah man, man. The myth fifth.

892
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,410
Well that's one of the reasons
why I fit in there from stand up,

893
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:50,850
you know like starting doing stand up
from 21 then being around these pool hall

894
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:53,730
guys when I was like 23 or 24 I was like,

895
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,370
oh you guys are like my fucked up friends.
And I like,

896
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:02,190
it's like too many people out there think
that there's like only one way to live

897
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:07,920
your life. Like there's a, there's a
bunch of ways to live life. There's a lot.

898
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,370
Yeah,

899
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,610
it's a whole lot of worlds and everybody
wants you to think that Darryl way of

900
00:54:11,611 --> 00:54:13,440
living life is the way
you should go about it.

901
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,420
It's real tricky because they all want
like the sort of confirmation bias they

902
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,550
want. They want you to confirm they
want to. Well, it's more like a,

903
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:23,100
a confirmation desire.

904
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:25,020
They want you to confirm that
they're doing the right thing.

905
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:28,210
If you listen to them and then you
become happy and uh, you know, they,

906
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,000
they come up to you and they go, hey man,
I'm really, really excited that you, uh,

907
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,850
you told me how to do it this way
because now I'm just living my life much

908
00:54:35,851 --> 00:54:38,700
better. Thank you very much. That
people love to hear that. Like, Hey,

909
00:54:38,701 --> 00:54:42,120
I'm right then I am living my life
the right way. It's not right way.

910
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:46,290
No. He know how many paths. Yes, be
nice. Be Positive, work hard and do it.

911
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,730
Do what you want, man, that's moving.

912
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,630
I would have never got here if
I listen to people, you know,

913
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,880
it's impossible.
They don't even know what they're saying.

914
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:55,280
People give you advice when they're
absolutely not true what they're saying.

915
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,020
They just say track. They
practice on you. They get,

916
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,840
sometimes people give
you advice and it's real.

917
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,870
Sometimes people have great advice.
Sometimes people are really mean. Well,

918
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,610
and sometimes people are just practicing.

919
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,240
Yeah. They're like, this is in general.
How can anyone give you advice that does,

920
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:11,270
doesn't relate to something
that happened to them. You know,

921
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:16,350
they're only going by their life
experience. So that was one thing. Um,

922
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,420
I learned from the Chris Jericho,
another wrestler where he was just like,

923
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:25,421
you don't listen to unsuccessful people
because they don't know how to do it.

924
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,050
Why would they tell you?

925
00:55:27,051 --> 00:55:30,260
Of course they're going to tell you you
can't do it because they couldn't do it.

926
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:34,400
A successful person will tell you,
you can do it. Most people I know,

927
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,390
like if you tell someone that, hey,
I want to go try comedy, you know,

928
00:55:38,391 --> 00:55:40,640
if you've only, if you have the
balls to get up there and do it,

929
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,350
they're going to support you,
you know?

930
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:44,023
Yeah.

931
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,530
And there's this planning those
people out there on both sides.

932
00:55:48,531 --> 00:55:50,960
There's plenty of people out there that
will give you good advice and really

933
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:54,410
care and want you to do well in your life.

934
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:57,020
And there's plenty of people that don't
want to see anybody doing any better

935
00:55:57,021 --> 00:56:00,530
than them and then not doing that well.
There's a lot of that.

936
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:04,760
There's a lot of that that's a sickness
that we've got to forgive people for.

937
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:09,140
Cause I had it when I was a young man
for sure and I think many of us struggle

938
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:09,680
with it.

939
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,770
It's one of the things that made me
realize that I was looking at stand up the

940
00:56:12,771 --> 00:56:15,170
wrong way and turns where
like other people to stand up.

941
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:19,250
And I was looking at other people stand
up as like a comparison to mine in that

942
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,910
uh, I was judging like who's
the best? Who's doing better?
Who's this? Who's that?

943
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:24,070
And I realized like that is so

944
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,903
stupid.

945
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,170
Like I should just be a fan
of comedy and do comedy.

946
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:33,040
And so I shifted the way I thought
about it. So it's instead of like,

947
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,840
when I would see someone
killing, I'd be like, God,

948
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:38,020
I wish I thought of that bit or a God,
he's doing so good shit.

949
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:42,370
Now I have to follow them instead.
Somewhere along the line,

950
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,970
I got to a place where you're
like, this is great, this is funny.

951
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,980
Like I love the fact that this guy's fun.
Now I can become a fan of comedy again.

952
00:56:49,981 --> 00:56:50,350
Yeah.

953
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,220
Instead of like being wrapped up in my
own creation of it and producing my own

954
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:54,680
stuff.

955
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,700
Yeah. Well I always not though
always on a similar journey.

956
00:56:58,701 --> 00:57:02,450
I was very competitive,
not but maybe a year or two ago.

957
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,890
And again,

958
00:57:03,891 --> 00:57:06,560
in the relationship that I'm in now has
been very helpful because she's a big

959
00:57:06,561 --> 00:57:10,370
fan of comedy and she always wants to
watch comedy. And so then I'm always like,

960
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,900
okay, I have to just not be, I just have
to enjoy these people too because yeah,

961
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:19,100
you're right there. They're great.
And, and, and I had to learn,

962
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:22,490
like I don't want everybody to be doing
the comedy that I'm doing or I'm not

963
00:57:22,491 --> 00:57:25,910
special. I want to see all these
different types of styles. I think,

964
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,300
I mean the fact that me and you are in
this room together and we both respect

965
00:57:29,301 --> 00:57:34,280
each other's comedy in our comedy
worlds apart in different, you know,

966
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,410
just two completely different styles.

967
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:40,850
But we both respect each other because
we both know that we are authentic in

968
00:57:40,851 --> 00:57:44,720
what we do. You know, I, if I were to
try to be like you, that would make

969
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:49,150
no sense. I was trying to be
like, you know, people would go,

970
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:50,110
what's going on man?

971
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,070
What are you doing up there Joe?
Smoke too much

972
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:59,310
slow down man.
You want that?

973
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,420
What does that self Kratom

974
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,220
a lot of people on that cradle. No,
I respect the fuck out of you man.

975
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,640
And I respect your process.
You know, you're uh,

976
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,480
like we were talking about it as
a, as an art form, as this um,

977
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:18,170
structure based, you know,
like you, you structure things,

978
00:58:18,171 --> 00:58:20,780
you know how to set
things up is so important.

979
00:58:20,781 --> 00:58:24,830
Then we don't have anyone
to tell us how to do it.

980
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,580
We have to kind of like learn from each
other and learn from the greats of the

981
00:58:28,581 --> 00:58:30,830
past that we can, you know, we could wash.

982
00:58:30,831 --> 00:58:35,831
But it's in a lot of ways it's sort of
an undocumented art form in terms of the

983
00:58:35,931 --> 00:58:37,190
creation of the art form.

984
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,550
And part of the problem is that
everybody has their own way of doing it.

985
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:44,420
Like that's why I asked you like, do
you write down, do you, uh, do you type,

986
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,490
do you just have some,

987
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:48,590
some of the best just to have
ideas and they don't write shit.

988
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:51,760
And then they go on stage a lot and then
they work those ideas out when they're

989
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,770
on stage and they work those ideas out
in their head and they keep everything in

990
00:58:54,771 --> 00:58:58,070
their head. You know, there's a lot of
guys who are really great who don't,

991
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,740
they don't write,
they just write in the moment.

992
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:04,370
They're right on stage and they have
ideas and they flesh them out and he

993
00:59:04,371 --> 00:59:06,320
continued to work on them
and they just stay active.

994
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,110
And I never have to actually sit and
write. And there's some of the best.

995
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:12,810
And then there's guys who write every
day and there's some of the best. And I,

996
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,260
it's like, fuck man, I don't think
there's a right way to do it.

997
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:16,720
I think is it just us to have,

998
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:20,960
you just have to care and you have to
be trying to get better? Yes. A hundred,

999
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,030
hundred 70

1000
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:25,790
zero. It's gotta be effort
and not going back in.

1001
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,690
Like what I'm trying to do now is as be
a little bit more picky because I go,

1002
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,360
I like did my special, and then
I go write a joke and I go, oh,

1003
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:36,410
you're basically doing an extension of
what you've already written and like,

1004
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:40,520
don't, don't do that. Like, let's try
something new. Let's go some more.

1005
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:44,690
If you don't have it this,
just go up there and relax a bit.

1006
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:48,370
Live life a little bit. Yeah. Because
most of my materials personal anyway,

1007
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:52,250
you know, I don't really do a lot of
topical, so for me to generate material,

1008
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:56,240
I usually have to be active in
life and that things happen to me.

1009
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,100
Yes, yes. Yeah. I think, um,

1010
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,990
I think it's really important to be around
a lot of other people that are doing

1011
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,260
it really well too. You know, I'm,

1012
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:11,880
one of the things I really get out of La
was on any given night I can go to the

1013
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:15,000
store and watch someone murder, you know,
quick all the time and were like, no,

1014
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:18,400
I'm one person, like six, seven,
eight people Kaelin in their own way.

1015
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,810
And you just around that,

1016
01:00:19,811 --> 01:00:23,710
did you just get this like extra juice
out of that place? Man, you know,

1017
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:28,180
you get extra juice out of La, out of
the store a lot of times have the Improv.

1018
01:00:28,181 --> 01:00:30,970
It's like there's just,
there's so many of us here.

1019
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,360
It's a crazy hive of comedians if you
really stop and think about it. Yeah.

1020
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,583
You know,

1021
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:39,880
I mean Jean Diaz and Burger and you know,

1022
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:43,060
a Segura is here, you know, you're here.

1023
01:00:43,061 --> 01:00:48,061
Deleah I mean it's just fucking every
week that places mom Marin's here.

1024
01:00:48,551 --> 01:00:53,360
It's like Theo Vaughn's here. It's
just, it's chaos. Sebastian's here.

1025
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,120
Yeah.
Like Holy Shit.

1026
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,140
You might get a drop and from Chappelle
and you all the time. Yeah. All the time.

1027
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,610
Yeah.
I mean,

1028
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:04,810
it's one of the weirdest places ever
in terms of like a hive of comedy.

1029
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:07,720
And we're so lucky to be in that hive,
man,

1030
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:12,010
be watching all the shit go down in 2019.
You know,

1031
01:01:12,011 --> 01:01:14,320
this is an epic time for standup.

1032
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,490
Yeah. That's the thing. It ain't no,
don't like to bring it up all the time.

1033
01:01:17,491 --> 01:01:21,480
But like when something like what Brody's
passing happens, I have to go like,

1034
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:22,131
oh yeah,

1035
01:01:22,131 --> 01:01:27,090
it's stabbing and so in the rat race and
so competitive all the time and worried

1036
01:01:27,091 --> 01:01:32,091
about what you're making and realize that
the true gift is the time that you get

1037
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:35,850
the spin with these truly unique minds.
You know,

1038
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:39,330
the people who don't think like me at all,
people who like you say you,

1039
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,480
I see jokes every day where I go,
oh fuck.

1040
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:46,450
Like how like that was in
the air for anyone. Yes. Yes,

1041
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,640
yes, yes. That's the weirdest feeling,
right? When you're like, fuck,

1042
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:53,400
how did I miss that?
God dammit.

1043
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,960
Tony Hinchcliffe has a joke right now. I
don't want to give it away, but, uh, it's,

1044
01:01:57,961 --> 01:02:02,790
it's one of those where he's, he does
it. I go, God, I miss that. So good.

1045
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:07,130
Santana has got this bit about
candles. Then I'm like, ah, you know,

1046
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,980
I worked with them all weekend. I was
in Austin with him. He's great. Yeah.

1047
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:15,840
I love him. To George Perez to George
Perez murdered, murdered in Austin.

1048
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,770
Oh yeah, it did. Cap City Comedy Club.
I wanted to go do the comedy for a goof.

1049
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,420
I need to, uh, do more comedy clubs. Uh,

1050
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,080
it's just such a different
thing that you're rich comic,

1051
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,870
do the club as a goof.

1052
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,210
You make a decision whether you want to
make a lot of money or have a lot of fun.

1053
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:38,930
Yeah, true. Truly. Yeah.
Yeah. And I'm, it's not that,

1054
01:02:38,931 --> 01:02:41,930
it's not a lot of money to work in a club.
It's, it's great money. It's not bad,

1055
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,130
but it's, um, it's a different
choice. It's like the choice
of a right now for me,

1056
01:02:46,131 --> 01:02:46,691
the choices we'll,

1057
01:02:46,691 --> 01:02:51,200
how about just trying to make my shit
make more sense and more reps in front of

1058
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:55,430
different people. And, and, and more
feels more different vibe. You know,

1059
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:58,820
every time you go on stage you're in a
different place. Audience is different.

1060
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:01,250
Introduce yourself to new people.
Yeah. Well, I'm trying to do,

1061
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:05,350
I'm getting ready to go out on a tour
and I specifically was asking my Mike,

1062
01:03:05,351 --> 01:03:09,110
my people were like, I was like, I
want to go to Huntsville, Alabama.

1063
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,550
We want to go to like,

1064
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:13,130
I want to go to these places
that you don't expect to see me.

1065
01:03:13,131 --> 01:03:14,900
And I want to see a,

1066
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:17,570
because I think it'd be cool to just
bring in people who were like, hey,

1067
01:03:17,571 --> 01:03:21,890
why are you here? And I want to see,
um, that's why I'm going to Australia.

1068
01:03:21,891 --> 01:03:24,800
I just want to see, make my comedy
travel. And I will, I'll learn,

1069
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,730
I'll learn how to,

1070
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:29,330
I'm sure I'll go in there and I'll say
something as too American and I'll be

1071
01:03:29,331 --> 01:03:30,790
like, oh, okay. Right.

1072
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:35,030
And it'll just denote inform my writing
and I would start writing more globally

1073
01:03:35,031 --> 01:03:37,760
and, and you know, and those are the
type of things I'm looking for it now.

1074
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,530
They're, they're fantastic.
Australia is great.

1075
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:45,420
They're like a alternative Americans.
And I say that a good way, like in,

1076
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,410
and they're like a degree
nicer than Canadians.

1077
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:51,660
So I could get Canadians who,

1078
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:55,590
where I say there's 20% less douchebags
in Canada than there is the United

1079
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:57,270
States. You could always
find bad people everywhere.

1080
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:01,440
But then you've got people from Australia,
I think they take that another 10%.

1081
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,940
It's like one of the nicest people
ever. They're so nice. Ah, can't wait.

1082
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,180
The fucking great man. Their shows or
shows over there. Amazing. You know,

1083
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:14,130
and they're, um, they're, they appreciate
it. They know most of our shit. You know,

1084
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:17,160
they understand most references
and things that we will talk about.

1085
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:21,190
But if you knew a few about
them, it would, it would
probably help them relate to,

1086
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,950
but it's, it's a weird culture. It's,

1087
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,620
it's a place that I would totally
live if I didn't live here.

1088
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,250
If I didn't live in America or it didn't
live in Canada, I want to go anywhere.

1089
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:31,920
I'm not saying I want to leave America,
but I said if I did,

1090
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:34,920
yeah, but you travel and you go that
you, you, you find a place. Okay,

1091
01:04:34,921 --> 01:04:37,180
this is fun to visit.
And then you find those places.

1092
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,910
I'd like to me like Italy is nice to
visit by. Like, I could never live here,

1093
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,570
but then I go to Amsterdam and I'm like,
I live here. This is like Portland,

1094
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:48,740
this is great. But like
Portland. Yeah, Portland sort
of fashion itself. After that,

1095
01:04:48,741 --> 01:04:52,360
when it became legal to have
weed there too. Right. Have you,

1096
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,550
did a lot of those places were comparing
themselves to Amsterdam way back in the

1097
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:57,590
day. You know, it's funny.

1098
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:00,290
Amsterdam was a place where people
would actually go there to get high.

1099
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,440
It's like the, the very first high
destination. Like people try broke,

1100
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:06,860
we're going to go to Amsterdam,
get high.

1101
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:11,660
I like going just for the vibe of like
we were talking about earlier of um,

1102
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:16,880
no stigma and there is no, like someone,
if, you know, I dropped something on the,

1103
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,040
wherever the people,
oh,

1104
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,330
you stoner. Like there's nothing like that
in Amsterdam. And I love that feeling.

1105
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,170
It's a dumb thing here.
That's just a remanent of propaganda.

1106
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,890
End Dumps donors that are real people.

1107
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:31,803
You know what I mean?

1108
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,990
There's always that time where you're
running to someone who is too high and

1109
01:05:34,991 --> 01:05:37,750
you're like, aw man, you're just
fucking up the whole stereotype, man.

1110
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,940
You're perpetrating sir.
Oh,

1111
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,970
you can smoke a bowl and others not
coming out of your nose like, yeah,

1112
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,230
there was certain people
that just get too high.

1113
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:47,960
Yeah,

1114
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:51,890
they just get too high or too weirded out
by life. And you're like, Bro, slow down.

1115
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:56,420
Or right now you're okay. I
know everybody's okay. Yeah,

1116
01:05:56,421 --> 01:06:00,380
the end is horrible for everyone and
anyone, but right now you're okay.

1117
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:04,490
So if you can't be happy now when you're
okay and you're worried about the times

1118
01:06:04,491 --> 01:06:07,340
when you're not going to be
okay, that is madness. All right?

1119
01:06:07,341 --> 01:06:10,010
So you've got a police off out
of madness and be in the moment.

1120
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,900
In the moment everything's fine,

1121
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:16,580
but that's a tight wire walk when you're
high as fuck. Right when you're sober

1122
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,410
is it is.

1123
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:25,110
So do you see they let that dude off
the empire guys? I let them slide.

1124
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:28,910
I love it. It makes it so
exciting for me. I've been,

1125
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:33,390
I've been, I lived them on class couple
of days, told my girlfriend I go, I go.

1126
01:06:33,391 --> 01:06:37,890
The craziest thing would be if they say
he's not guilty because then you have to

1127
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:41,940
go, what happened? What
happened? What happened?

1128
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:45,810
Did he bribe somebody or did some new
evidence come forth that they had a bad

1129
01:06:45,811 --> 01:06:50,100
investigation?
Did the two guys that were his witnesses,

1130
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:51,960
did they get caught lying
about something else?

1131
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,030
You know the witnesses against him,

1132
01:06:54,031 --> 01:06:56,310
they might've caught them lying about
something else and they don't know what to

1133
01:06:56,311 --> 01:06:58,050
do and they have to abandon the case.

1134
01:06:58,051 --> 01:07:01,260
Cause then they obviously know that he's
a lot, these guys lied about something.

1135
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,400
Who the fuck knows man?

1136
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:06,580
I'm understanding I can make a guest
and as they won't be educated but,

1137
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:08,790
and just know in Chicago in general,
I'm in,

1138
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:13,791
my guess is maybe the way they were going
after the investigation wasn't really

1139
01:07:13,831 --> 01:07:16,830
above board. And if they,
if they, if he's just like,

1140
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:21,330
I'm not guilty and they have to actually
go in and present this evidence,

1141
01:07:21,331 --> 01:07:25,680
they don't have, you know, they don't have
what they really need to have, you know,

1142
01:07:25,681 --> 01:07:30,430
like I don't, I don't think anyone's
going around like, okay, yeah,

1143
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:33,320
well then those two Nigerian
Maca guys did attack him.

1144
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:39,490
Mager guys, it's so great. Well
then also they sealed the case.

1145
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,620
So fun. Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. If
you wanted to like a good twist,

1146
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:46,510
you know,
in the movie,

1147
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:50,350
like this is a crazy scene in the movie
were crazy music is playing and you see

1148
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:55,480
Jesse Smollett come out in slow motion
and put his sunglasses on and get into

1149
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:57,220
the limo guilty

1150
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:04,270
and he comes out in slow motion and gets
in the Limo and then dudes are wearing

1151
01:08:04,271 --> 01:08:07,150
ski masks and people are
pulling on it. It's like, uh,

1152
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:11,170
like one ongoing story.
And one of those Tarantino movies.

1153
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,500
Well you got four stores like
pulp fiction battling it out.

1154
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,540
He's one of them where he gets not guilty
and it becomes a big twist cause you

1155
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:21,440
feel like you find out that some behind
the scenes shenanigans and shit that led

1156
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:24,800
to this cause what happens? People are
like, oh, he's never going to work again.

1157
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:28,250
But now not guilty. So does he get
his own show? It's a good question.

1158
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:29,120
What happened?
Well,

1159
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:34,121
the other thing is for live the longest
time Chicago has been thought to be a

1160
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:38,930
place that is like a,
you know,

1161
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:43,580
like things can happen there. You could,
you could make shit happen. Right.

1162
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,850
Is that a fair way to say it? I love
Chicago. I don't want to be disparaging,

1163
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,690
but there's been some, uh, some
cases of corruption. Oh yeah. No,

1164
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:53,420
I mean that's where I was
raised it very corrupt place.

1165
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:56,270
Most of our mayors and stuff go to jail.

1166
01:08:58,610 --> 01:09:02,690
So I don't think I'm being
unfair. Yeah, there's a,

1167
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,190
there was a scene in a movie.

1168
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,330
What was the scene in the movie where
someone's Chicago is the most corrupt big

1169
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:11,670
city. Illinois. Third, uh,

1170
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:15,270
most corrupt state in the country ties.
Yeah,

1171
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,200
that's cray published February 15th.
So this shit, this is recent. Uh,

1172
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,560
oh my goodness. Yeah.
Um, I don't know man.

1173
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,860
I don't know about Chicago. I'd be
talking out of my ass, you know,

1174
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,980
I know him a little bit. Tell me
what it's like. It was very cold.

1175
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:35,340
It was very cool. We're up locked right
then. Sometimes it's very hot. Right?

1176
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:40,720
Is he is either usually too cold and
shooty a very hot and shooty and then the

1177
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:43,670
spring is delightful.
Shooty

1178
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:49,550
that's the best verb ever
shooting to shooting.

1179
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:53,600
This is a little too shooty over.
That's fucking hilarious. Shooty yeah,

1180
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,680
it is a it's way, way, way, way,
way too shooty. Right. And um,

1181
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,670
do you think that people, I, this is my
opinion, I want to know if you agree.

1182
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:06,440
I think the people in colder
areas like Detroit and Boston,

1183
01:10:06,441 --> 01:10:08,840
Chicago,
like there are different kinds of people.

1184
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:12,950
There are hardier people than people
that grow up. Like in San Diego.

1185
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:15,860
No disrespect San Diego. I'm sure a
lot of you are hard, hardest fuck.

1186
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:19,670
But there's like a difference between
people that have to shovel snow and deal

1187
01:10:19,671 --> 01:10:22,940
with that fucking winter and be holed
up and really be fucking freezing.

1188
01:10:22,941 --> 01:10:25,850
Like when you come in from
outside like fuck, fuck, fuck.

1189
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:29,570
And you appreciate the warmth of a
nice restaurant or something like that.

1190
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:33,300
When you walk in from out of the
cold people shoveling snow is,

1191
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:38,060
it's windy as hell. And then you got like
very aggressive homeless people there.

1192
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:41,120
So you're going to, yeah,
you're going to get tougher.

1193
01:10:41,121 --> 01:10:45,770
I had to program that for myself when
I moved from Chicago to Oregon because,

1194
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:49,130
and then taught as a teen.
It was always like even my walking,

1195
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:53,510
my walking was too slow for Oregon because
I would walk and I take a look back

1196
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,410
cause that's how my mom taught me to
walk and Chicago's make sure nobody's

1197
01:10:57,411 --> 01:11:01,400
sneaking up on you. And in
Oregon they didn't have, they
didn't have that concern.

1198
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:04,130
Yeah.
Fuck,

1199
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:09,290
that's a weird way for a kid to grow up
to men always be worried about danger.

1200
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:16,440
One of the strange things about that is
that it's very hard for people to get

1201
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:17,340
over that hump.

1202
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:21,420
It's a very hard for people to just
calm down after they've been in a bad

1203
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:22,680
environment for a long time.

1204
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:26,580
You get wired a certain way and even
though you're in a new place now and

1205
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:28,110
everything's calm,
you're still looking out.

1206
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,170
You're still thinking this
shit could go sideways.

1207
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:34,970
You've seen people go
sideways. Yeah, yeah.

1208
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,960
That's why it's hard to be
in a relationship with me.

1209
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:45,480
Something I miss about when it was snowing
and you would go outside and it would

1210
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:50,280
be silent, you and your anything. It
was one of some of my favorite times.

1211
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,920
I live in,
in Boston or in Newton where I was.

1212
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,980
I lived right across the street from the
Charles River and there was this like

1213
01:11:55,981 --> 01:12:00,470
this big grassy area in front of my house
and you just look at, oh, the white,

1214
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:05,400
it would just be Oh, thick white snow
and it muffled everything like it looks,

1215
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:08,190
so it was sound insulation for everything.
You didn't hear shit.

1216
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,230
You know that feeling, Jamie,
you grew up in Columbus.

1217
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:13,820
You know when you get a like a
big snowstorm storm it's like,

1218
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:18,090
it's just like sound deadening everywhere.
There's no hard edges anymore.

1219
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:21,480
Everything is covered with snow.
It's just,

1220
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:27,630
it feels good. It would feel good.
It would feel like this is nice.

1221
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:29,850
As long as you have food,
as long as you know it's going to go away.

1222
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,830
As long as the plows are still running,

1223
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:36,330
as long as you have either firewood
or backup generator or something.

1224
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:40,200
Sometime that electricity cuts
out and then everyone gets scared.

1225
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:44,070
Noddles up together.
I remember that episode of I love Lucy.

1226
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,960
Did you ever have that happen? Yeah,
now did take the fine. I did too.

1227
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,101
Everybody does.

1228
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:53,370
If you live in a place where its nose at
some point in time the power goes out.

1229
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,610
I remember these guys in Toronto were
telling me their power went out for two

1230
01:12:56,611 --> 01:13:01,611
weeks and it was fucking crazy cold like
in the Zeros and below zero and they

1231
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:07,620
were doomed. I mean there's
ice everywhere. I said need
the power lines fall down.

1232
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:08,790
They had a,
you know,

1233
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:12,240
like frozen rain had come and covered
everything when ice and things were

1234
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:16,400
breaking off and power was outed and
like blocks and blocks and blocks and all

1235
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:21,280
these people in fucking the dead of
winter in a city we're endanger day.

1236
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:24,770
Scary, scary shit man. Because
you know me man, you firewood,

1237
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:27,390
you don't have a place to burn it.
You're in a goddamn apartment building.

1238
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:29,940
What are you going to do?
Everybody's fucking freezing.

1239
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,370
No one's going to help you.
The phone doesn't work.

1240
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:36,360
It's not fucking power is stuff you
think about a lot though. Right?

1241
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:41,360
Cause you only talk about that like the
so coddled wit you know about the thin

1242
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:42,840
veneer of civilization.

1243
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:47,370
That's what I think about and when I
think about it more than anything is from

1244
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:49,830
natural disasters.
That's what I think about.

1245
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,720
I think about the potential for
natural disasters. There's this,

1246
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:58,920
it can happen at any moment and most
people have no preparation for it

1247
01:13:58,921 --> 01:14:03,810
whatsoever. They have no idea what they
would do. It just seems that if you,

1248
01:14:03,811 --> 01:14:06,780
if you're paying attention to history
at all, you know that this happened.

1249
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:10,200
It happens all the time. It almost just
happened that one that you were, uh,

1250
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,430
you pulled up the other day
that happened in December,

1251
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,700
some asteroid that blew up
in our atmosphere that had
five times the power of a

1252
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,113
Hiroshima.

1253
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:20,770
Okay.

1254
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:24,840
10 Times, 10 times the power of
Hiroshima blows up in our atmosphere,

1255
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:30,210
mother Fucker, man, that hits, that
hits Chicago right in the face.

1256
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:33,930
That can happen. I mean, it's
happened all over the world before.

1257
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:39,420
There's a total possibility that we can
get hit with a chunk of iron the size of

1258
01:14:39,421 --> 01:14:43,650
a fucking ocean liner and it just
slammed into a city, a nukes, that city.

1259
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,910
That shit happens. I think that, yeah.

1260
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:49,800
Did that bother you or
that it make you more free?

1261
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,760
Uh, I would lie to you. It makes
you more for, it makes me more free.

1262
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,610
I don't think that's true though.
I think a,

1263
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,890
it definitely makes me sound paranoid,

1264
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:05,090
but I've thought about that a lot and
it's just, I'm just being accurate.

1265
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:09,380
But it also, um, uh, pretty, uh,
pretty. You can be boat. Yes.

1266
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:13,790
I tried to be pretty present. Try to be
pretty here. You know as much as I can.

1267
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:15,620
And so if you're here,

1268
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:19,670
like if you present and you
are aware of all these things,

1269
01:15:19,671 --> 01:15:21,740
it's just a slippery or grip on present,

1270
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:25,430
but you could still be present and
aware like this ain't going to last.

1271
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,110
This whole thing ain't going to last.

1272
01:15:27,111 --> 01:15:29,870
So these people are building buildings
right next to the goddamn ocean,

1273
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,050
the oceans rising,
you know it's,

1274
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:35,150
there's a real possibility that rocks are
going to slam it in this mother fucker

1275
01:15:35,151 --> 01:15:39,530
any day now or a hundred years from now
or five years from now. Nobody knows.

1276
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:42,290
But one day it's going to
happen and it's going to be,

1277
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,780
and the fucking earth is going
to ring for a million years.

1278
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:49,933
That's what happens.

1279
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:50,880
Okay,

1280
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,260
nice. I mean, I'm okay with that because
it's out of my control in that regard.

1281
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,330
It's a good way to look at it,
but it's also

1282
01:15:59,290 --> 01:15:59,820
okay.

1283
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,910
Seems like Horse Shit because
this world seems very permanent.

1284
01:16:02,911 --> 01:16:05,820
This moment seems very permanent.
Life seems very real.

1285
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:08,070
It's been real my whole life every day.
Right?

1286
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:13,470
Life is real. You know, I don't, but
that's it. You know, this too shall pass.

1287
01:16:13,471 --> 01:16:16,590
Right. You know, you got it. You
always know it and nothing is, is true.

1288
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:20,280
I think that's one of the biggest
life lessons I had by having a,

1289
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:25,281
I'm not most stable childhood moving
around a lot and bouncing around to

1290
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:28,140
different schools in different
states where I was like,

1291
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:31,280
I learned very quickly that
things aren't permanent.

1292
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,580
I learned also that things are very
relative to whatever area you are.

1293
01:16:35,581 --> 01:16:37,950
That's what really helped me.
Um,

1294
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:41,550
I think held my voice as a comedian now
is that I've learned very young that

1295
01:16:41,551 --> 01:16:45,930
like what's cool is very relative
to wherever you are. You know,

1296
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,730
the things that were cool in Chicago,

1297
01:16:47,731 --> 01:16:52,170
people weren't on in Oregon and things
that were cool in Oregon or like Greece,

1298
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:55,050
you know, they would get
beat up in Chicago. Yeah.

1299
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:57,420
So I learned very quickly
it'd just be like, Oh man,

1300
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:00,960
just joy what I do and
just like what I'm about,

1301
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:06,270
it's, um, it's really helped my life
be more, more peaceful in that way.

1302
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:07,140
And that's why that,
you know,

1303
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:10,940
36 year old man who owns shit
ton of wrestling action figures.

1304
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,211
Yeah,

1305
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:18,770
that's half of the life is trying to
find the balance between being satisfied

1306
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:23,320
and being motivated and being
happy and just being, again,

1307
01:17:23,321 --> 01:17:27,230
just being present, you know, just
finding out what you actually enjoy.

1308
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:31,410
Just doing it just to that thing,
you know,

1309
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,120
was wrestling action figures and
that's where it's weird. The Path.

1310
01:17:36,121 --> 01:17:37,890
Did you think of that
thing would be like comedy,

1311
01:17:37,891 --> 01:17:39,380
but then you also learn that you can't,

1312
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:43,280
you can overdose on that
and you can be over. Um,

1313
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:48,510
cause that's the thing I like when I
was started headlining and then I w you

1314
01:17:48,511 --> 01:17:50,590
hear these stories and
what w when I was younger,

1315
01:17:50,591 --> 01:17:54,870
when like when Greg Geraldo died or
Patrice died and I just get these parts

1316
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:59,070
where I might men that's like [inaudible]
obviously all due respect to them,

1317
01:17:59,071 --> 01:18:01,860
not as I said, but I was like,
I don't want to die on a road.

1318
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:05,040
That's not how I wanna live my life.

1319
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:07,800
That I don't want to be found in
some hotel somewhere. I want Mike,

1320
01:18:07,801 --> 01:18:12,030
my family around me and
people who care about me. And,

1321
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,220
and that really made me be like,
okay,

1322
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,990
I have to think about more than
just like each individual set.

1323
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:21,450
I have to start thinking about what
do I want to give back? What do I,

1324
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,600
what do I want to do bigger than that?
Like do,

1325
01:18:24,601 --> 01:18:29,070
what do I want to do if I just
want to do the road for fun,

1326
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,120
if I just want to,

1327
01:18:30,121 --> 01:18:33,750
like if I want to move into something
else when my son's 16 he's going to be

1328
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,780
going, hopefully he'll be going to
college soon and I want to be like,

1329
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,110
I want to be able to spend
more time with him, you know?

1330
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,220
Yeah. Your, your life
as a comic, you know,

1331
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:48,330
it oftentimes I find that guys go through
these stages and then the first stage

1332
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:52,880
kind of feel like an imposter. I feel like
a fraud, you know, you feel like, like,

1333
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:55,220
you know, I'm not really that
good at this. And then you,

1334
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:58,880
you get to a stage where you feel like
a professional when you feel you're a

1335
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:03,050
professional and then you start to take,
put more responsibility on you,

1336
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:04,640
on your work. You know, for me,

1337
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,560
I think that's right around
when it happened with me,

1338
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:08,960
somewhere around 10 years
in, I decided like, Hey,

1339
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:13,280
I gotta I gotta treat this like I'm an
actual professional and stop fucking off.

1340
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:15,050
I was,
I fucked off a lot.

1341
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:18,250
I went through periods of years where
I didn't write anything or just,

1342
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:21,440
it was really lazy and I had the same sex.
I was doing TV show shit,

1343
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:25,580
like a sitcom stuff and I just wasn't,
wasn't working on the act at all.

1344
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,480
But, um, it's just such a more, um,

1345
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,740
energized time right now in comedy.
You know, guys like Santina,

1346
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:37,490
like when we're talking about all these
guys that are coming up all, every,

1347
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:41,450
having all this good comedy
around you, it's almost like, um,

1348
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:46,370
like it raises everybody's vibration.
Like the whole,

1349
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:50,450
the whole community like is the better
everybody gets instead of how everybody

1350
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:53,390
used to approach it where everybody
was competing against each other.

1351
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:56,690
And then you kinda like have weird
feelings when you're running each other.

1352
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,640
Now everything's like a
different kind of odd,

1353
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:02,540
yeah, it's a, um, it's
a healthy competition.

1354
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:07,800
And one thing I'm really liking is
a change of the presentation of um,

1355
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:13,730
people being more cognizant of like I
want to present like just dressing up

1356
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:16,110
more,
you know,

1357
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:20,280
looking nice or not necessarily
trying to like suit up or anything.

1358
01:20:20,281 --> 01:20:23,640
But I see more and more posters are more
and more things where the people are

1359
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:28,440
clearly putting work into their graphic
design and their heart are even.

1360
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:31,950
Um, and I don't want to speak for,
for, for female comedians at all,

1361
01:20:31,951 --> 01:20:36,450
but like I'm just noticing a trend more
where women are being not cause it used

1362
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:41,010
to be either like I am the hot
girl or like I'm just a dude.

1363
01:20:41,011 --> 01:20:43,470
Like you don't, don't
worry. I might be high,

1364
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:45,660
but you wouldn't know because
I'm wearing a Hoodie, you know?

1365
01:20:45,661 --> 01:20:49,110
And now there's just more of these
women being like, I'm just me and it's,

1366
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:52,590
I'm might be hot, but that's not
a part of this. And, you know,

1367
01:20:52,591 --> 01:20:55,260
and I see that a lot now,
but they'll still go out there and know,

1368
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:59,010
put other their posters where they're
like in a bikini or whatever. You know,

1369
01:20:59,011 --> 01:21:01,150
cause it's like, why
wouldn't you? Right. Like,

1370
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:03,600
just like when I go and I wear a suit,
you know?

1371
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:08,190
But I love seeing people
take charge of that,

1372
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,690
of what they're presenting
and not just because,

1373
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:12,090
I mean that's how I use
the dress all the time,

1374
01:21:12,091 --> 01:21:15,600
which is where a big purple Hoodie or
whatever, you know. But now I'm more like,

1375
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:19,200
I want to look more like a,
I guess I'm like a star.

1376
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,400
Well there's definitely something to I,
you know,

1377
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:25,300
I remember the Martin Lawrence days when
he was on top and me wear those crazy

1378
01:21:25,301 --> 01:21:27,910
outfits on stage or Eddie Murphy in Ra,

1379
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:31,480
we wear this crazy leather jumpsuit.
You know,

1380
01:21:31,481 --> 01:21:34,660
like he put a lot of effort into what
he was going to wear. It delirious.

1381
01:21:34,661 --> 01:21:35,494
That was another one.

1382
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:39,700
Like Eddie Murphy had these crazy costumes
that you could only wear if you were

1383
01:21:39,701 --> 01:21:44,380
doing standup. And a lot of ways. I mean
it was the ultimate Eddie Murphy costume.

1384
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:45,431
You know what I'm saying?

1385
01:21:45,431 --> 01:21:48,820
Like if you really think about like
him shirtless in a red jacket. Yeah.

1386
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,170
Like with Kennison,
what do you picture?

1387
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:52,720
You picture the Baret you
pictured the overcoat,

1388
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,570
the picture of the white sneakers.
Like it was his crazy outfit.

1389
01:21:55,571 --> 01:21:58,960
He had like kind of a like you would
kind of expected that look from him.

1390
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:02,380
But with Eddie Murphy's, Eddie
Murphy was like, you know,

1391
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,030
leather like colored leather and you know,
it was very powerful.

1392
01:22:07,031 --> 01:22:10,540
It was very bold, which was
like his comedy, you know,

1393
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:13,600
it was like letting you know this
is a special night is the night.

1394
01:22:13,601 --> 01:22:16,300
He doesn't dress like this
every day. Yeah. This is, yeah,

1395
01:22:16,301 --> 01:22:17,890
he's on stage doing a show like that.

1396
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:22,950
Yeah. Yeah. Like you and just people who
think about the, the full presentation.

1397
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:27,240
I mean even doing that, like the playlists
that the club plays before my show,

1398
01:22:27,241 --> 01:22:29,620
like I've been setting that up now.
Right.

1399
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,100
Cause I want a vibe of mostly fish.

1400
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,080
I got to

1401
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,860
Piss so bad. So I want to keep going
though. I don't want to stop. So, uh,

1402
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:42,100
I was just did two podcasts in a row
and I drank too much coffee. So, Jamie,

1403
01:22:42,101 --> 01:22:44,770
why don't you guys talk about something
you have in common. All right. Okay.

1404
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:47,740
You guys have in common, I smoke
smart pot. Yeah. Oh, for sure bro.

1405
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:51,700
Have a freshie thank you. Have an
extra one for the road too, sir.

1406
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:57,130
You're welcome. I'll be right back.
Talk amongst yourselves. Okay, nice.

1407
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,370
Welcome Taylor. Ron Funches
the experience, right? You
have your own podcast too,

1408
01:23:00,371 --> 01:23:03,710
right? I do. It's called
getting better. Uh,

1409
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:05,950
what Ron Funches when we just kind of,

1410
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:11,010
I talked to people who I admire are
people who I want to learn from,

1411
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:15,580
people who have accomplished things I
want to accomplish or have gotten better

1412
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:18,000
in some form in their life. And I, uh,

1413
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:21,340
ask him about it and about setting
goals and stuff. Do you ever have,

1414
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,010
do you just set it up that way?
Like I was a conversation?

1415
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:25,420
Or did you put more thought into like,

1416
01:23:25,421 --> 01:23:28,810
I want to ask them these
kinds of questions and get
these kinds of things? Um,

1417
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,520
I mean there's just, there's some set
questions I usually just ask people about,

1418
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:37,300
about their goals and I asked
them about some advice to give me.

1419
01:23:37,301 --> 01:23:40,720
But other than that, it's usually just
some type of free form conversation.

1420
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:44,140
It's just, you know,
it's funny sometimes, uh,

1421
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,990
but for the most part it's just like,
um,

1422
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:52,440
the reason why I wanted to do it is
because I was a big fan of like Patton

1423
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,330
Oswalt's website, the spew and
stuff like that. When he had that,

1424
01:23:55,331 --> 01:23:58,360
and I noticed like when it was on Twitter,

1425
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,390
there had been a shift
from people who are like,

1426
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:04,990
used to be very supportive of me,
especially when it was fatter and stuff.

1427
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:06,370
And then it came this thing of like,

1428
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,190
anytime I would try to post
something positive, he will be like,

1429
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,190
why the fuck do you fuck?
Who Cares?

1430
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:15,670
You have money and you and you just, you
know, and I just want to be like, no,

1431
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:19,530
I'm not on a different side of the
fence because I did these things. I,

1432
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:23,730
I'm like over here being like, anybody
can fucking do it if my dumb ass dead. It,

1433
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:28,690
you know, so it just became more
about like, to me like talent and,

1434
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,553
um,

1435
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,900
success is more like this ocean that we
can all drink from. And it's about like,

1436
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:37,130
how did this person get to that ocean?

1437
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:40,860
I don't think there's people who are
talented untalented finding out their past

1438
01:24:40,861 --> 01:24:44,920
sort of to where you are now and what
keeps them motivated now. You know,

1439
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,630
like once you, people have some success
with what, why, what keeps you going?

1440
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:52,430
You know, it was a question I would
like to know from Joe, you know?

1441
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:55,720
Well he just walked back in
so maybe we can find out.

1442
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:01,090
Hit me with a question. What keeps you
motivated? But you're so successful,

1443
01:25:01,091 --> 01:25:03,280
you got a lot of money.
You're doing okay.

1444
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:06,820
Everything Ufc you like accomplish
so many things. So what,

1445
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,030
what makes you go to the store on a,
on a Tuesday night,

1446
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,910
uh, to work on, stand up? Um,

1447
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:17,800
I don't look when you, uh, when
you get successful at something,

1448
01:25:17,801 --> 01:25:19,990
the best thing that it
does alleviate stress,

1449
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,210
but it doesn't change the motivation.

1450
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:26,590
The motivation is always
to create something that I
like, that I can be proud of,

1451
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:28,510
that the people enjoy.
Most importantly,

1452
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:32,680
there's a bunch of people that watch
my standup. I gotta I gotta work at it.

1453
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,000
I don't want to be an asshole.

1454
01:25:34,001 --> 01:25:38,440
I don't want to be that guy that you
come to see my show and you'd go prepare.

1455
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:42,280
He didn't care. He didn't
try, you know. Thank you.

1456
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:46,900
I'm not going to be that. So I look, we
all have that sets. I'll have bad sets.

1457
01:25:46,901 --> 01:25:48,160
I'll try.
I'll try my best though.

1458
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:50,410
I fucking try my best and I'm
going to keep trying my best.

1459
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:54,760
Cause I think if I don't,
I leave.

1460
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:00,370
I leave a doubt in my own
head that shouldn't be there.

1461
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:04,160
If I do my best and it just doesn't work,

1462
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,980
I have to figure out what was wrong.

1463
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:12,220
But if I don't do my best and it doesn't
work, you feel like shit. Yeah. Okay.

1464
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,020
That's true. But I think that,
um, I still feel like shit,

1465
01:26:15,021 --> 01:26:16,520
even if it doesn't work and I did my best,

1466
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:24,080
I feel like a failure rather
than a loser. Yeah. But, um,

1467
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,230
I think when I was younger going to
doing comedy my twenties and it may,

1468
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:29,150
it might have just had
been a Portland thing.

1469
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:33,560
There was always kind of this vibe
of like, I didn't try my best.

1470
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:37,540
If I tried my best, I would have
crushed it, but I didn't try my best,

1471
01:26:37,541 --> 01:26:38,480
so I didn't really fail.

1472
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:39,620
Yeah.

1473
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:44,620
That's a trap that a lot of comics get
into when they are in front of a small

1474
01:26:44,781 --> 01:26:49,720
crowd. No more that. Yeah. Take a
little more. Damn. Ron goes deep. Um,

1475
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,660
and um, one of the, you know,

1476
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:57,830
those moments when you're a young comic
where someone says something to you and

1477
01:26:57,831 --> 01:27:00,950
it really gives you a nice boost. So
like you feel great about it. And uh,

1478
01:27:00,951 --> 01:27:01,761
one time,
uh,

1479
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:04,670
I was at the store and there was maybe
like 12 or 13 people in the audience.

1480
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,110
The most was like, no, I'll
keep going. It was, um,

1481
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:10,220
and Paul Mooney was in
the back of the room

1482
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,910
and, uh, he's 12 or 13 people.

1483
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:21,080
I'm just doing my act and
Mooney starts laughing hard,

1484
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:23,220
like a supportive laugh,
like he's with

1485
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:27,420
you. Ha Ha. Ah, he's Clap Ben

1486
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,920
and the knee came up to me after the
show and it goes something to the,

1487
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,760
something to extent of your real comic.
Like that's what makes you real comic.

1488
01:27:35,761 --> 01:27:39,870
You do those real shows in front
of all those people. You know,

1489
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,810
you do a real show. Yeah. You
don't, you don't like say, oh,

1490
01:27:42,811 --> 01:27:45,570
there's only 10 people or 15 feet.
You don't have asset.

1491
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,780
You go out there and do your best.
Okay.

1492
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:50,280
Yeah, that's a man is always
just so much to learn.

1493
01:27:50,281 --> 01:27:52,540
That's what I've been learning to.
Um,

1494
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,470
get out of like every
set is the same and like,

1495
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,080
this is my material and I've
been at it for a little bit.

1496
01:27:58,081 --> 01:28:00,970
But knowing how to shift
my energy for like that,

1497
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:04,890
like you do want to be professional
for that, those 10 people,

1498
01:28:04,891 --> 01:28:09,690
but you're not going to do the same
like yelling energy as if they were a

1499
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:12,030
hundred people. You're going to be
a little more intimate. You know,

1500
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:16,950
you gotta make it more of a conversation
and that's what I'm really learning to

1501
01:28:16,951 --> 01:28:20,730
do now. Watching, um, I think
for a lot of Comedians, but, um,

1502
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:24,760
that Garry Shandling documentary that
still haven't seen yet seen it. Oh Man.

1503
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:27,420
I love sweater.
He really helped me.

1504
01:28:27,421 --> 01:28:32,040
What I'm about me and mindful
about being in the moment.

1505
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:35,640
So I've been really,
like whenever I write a set list now,

1506
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:39,410
cause I usually number it and it has like
a couple of words, um, the first alley,

1507
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:44,190
right? Number one bullshit for as
long as possible because I don't like,

1508
01:28:44,191 --> 01:28:46,800
I don't want to just get into
it. I want to, uh, you know,

1509
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:49,440
unless it's like I got 10 minutes
and I have things I want to do,

1510
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:52,020
but for the most part I'm like,
let me get in a moment.

1511
01:28:52,021 --> 01:28:56,670
Let me look people in the eyes and see
if I see something not necessarily going

1512
01:28:56,671 --> 01:29:01,000
in and just Crowdwork and rip
on people. But let me, um,

1513
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:02,070
let

1514
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:06,180
me just go in and talk about my day for
a second and then maybe that will segway

1515
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:10,320
into my set. And so it teaches me
a new way to get into things. Uh,

1516
01:29:10,321 --> 01:29:13,260
more conversational. Yeah.
Again, you're very jazz.

1517
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:17,310
You got a lot of jazz and you Ron.
That's cool. That's a good way to do it.

1518
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:21,000
Cause it always does feel abrupt
when someone begins with a joke.

1519
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,850
Sometimes it works though.
Like some people can do it,

1520
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:28,980
they would go on stage and they just
hammer with a first joke and from there

1521
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:32,260
it's off to the races. Like the open up
with a non sequitur like out of nowhere.

1522
01:29:32,261 --> 01:29:33,320
I'm bang.
Yeah.

1523
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:37,980
Jeff Ross is really good at like just
changing the tempo in a room. Yes,

1524
01:29:37,981 --> 01:29:41,700
yes, yes. He's great at it.
On the off the cuff, you know,

1525
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,770
in the spur of the moment type shit.

1526
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:47,250
Cause all those years of roasting and
all those years of fucking with the crowd

1527
01:29:47,251 --> 01:29:48,100
like and,

1528
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:52,290
and that show they're doing him in a
towel or traveling and doing that bumping

1529
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:55,980
Mike show where they just, they just
fuck around man. I mean it's crazy.

1530
01:29:55,981 --> 01:29:58,650
They just get in front of those people
that walk around all crazy about what

1531
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:03,150
really opens your mind about gain with
this job can be where you could literally

1532
01:30:03,151 --> 01:30:07,770
just travel what your friend
and fuck around and sell out.

1533
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:11,760
Yeah. It's amazing. It's
amazing. It's a crazy Gig, man.

1534
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:17,310
It's crazy gig. When you started out
in Chicago, What Club were you at?

1535
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,530
Um, I didn't start in Chicago.
I was a ta. I was the,

1536
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:25,040
a young man I left when I was 13
cousins. Um, my mom was in like,

1537
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,200
she's in a little negative relationship,

1538
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:30,160
so I went to go live with
my dad in Oregon, um,

1539
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:33,430
and he was also a negative
thing. So, and then, um,

1540
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:38,210
I started comedy in Portland,
Oregon when I was 23, uh, um,

1541
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:43,220
Harvey's comedy club there. Ah, and
um, and then doing some shows in Salem,

1542
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:47,450
eh, there's Chinese food restaurant
called lucky fortune. And then,

1543
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,750
then I just started some
shows there and you know,

1544
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:55,820
struggle for Oh, a long
time. And then, um,

1545
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:57,200
think about five,
five year,

1546
01:30:57,201 --> 01:31:02,201
then I got asked to do Kona in and then
was new phase and then got divorced and

1547
01:31:04,311 --> 01:31:08,900
then it was like, all right, I'm moved,
uh, moved to Los Angeles. And, um,

1548
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:09,620
no,

1549
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:14,620
just I have my son here and she has been
me and him and now my girlfriend and my

1550
01:31:16,491 --> 01:31:20,570
mom now lives with me in the last year.
But um,

1551
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:22,400
yeah,
that's pretty much it.

1552
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:27,650
That sounds cool. Is there a scene in
Portland? We started when I started it.

1553
01:31:27,651 --> 01:31:31,720
It was pretty much like there, there
had been, um, Seattle has a scene. Yeah.

1554
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,990
There been a bit of a,
um,

1555
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:38,520
like an LG scene of like an enough
familiar with like Dwight Slade and shows

1556
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:42,480
rice. Um, and then not really much.

1557
01:31:42,481 --> 01:31:46,140
There's just a lot based off of road
gigs tripling. Ryan's going to Idaho.

1558
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:48,440
That's right. Everybody was
talking about those trivial runs.

1559
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,320
We had something similar,

1560
01:31:51,321 --> 01:31:54,860
which is not as exciting because you
guys were going through the wild west.

1561
01:31:55,250 --> 01:32:00,100
I mean, you're going to Montana and
Idaho. Oh, not me, not me. But the people

1562
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,630
that did it, the people who did it. Yeah.
I was, um, didn't seem lucky at the time,

1563
01:32:04,631 --> 01:32:08,320
but it turned out in hindsight to be
very lucky that the one time that that

1564
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:10,120
booker saw me,

1565
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:13,360
I just a share hardcore.

1566
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,510
And so nothing to do with me.

1567
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:20,110
And it turned out to be the best thing
because then I was in this position where

1568
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:20,860
I was like, oh, okay,

1569
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:25,660
well I'm not gonna get Idaho's shows so
I don't have to pander to that type of

1570
01:32:25,661 --> 01:32:28,210
audience and I'm just going to be here.

1571
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:32,320
And so I can right now is really just
like, oh, just write what you like.

1572
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:35,830
And that turned out to be the,
um, the best thing for me.

1573
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:40,170
Dude. You could perform in Boise. They
would love you. Oh, I, I've ended up,

1574
01:32:40,171 --> 01:32:41,490
I've had no,

1575
01:32:41,491 --> 01:32:46,260
I love Boise is like Portland
and it's a very unusual place.

1576
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:50,730
Almost like, I hate talking about it. I
don't want to give out their spot now.

1577
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:53,750
They got good little comedy. Same
building over there. Yeah, there's,

1578
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:55,110
well I think because of the Internet,

1579
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:59,220
there's a comedy scene almost any and
every city people will find a way to get

1580
01:32:59,221 --> 01:33:00,720
together and do something.
It's just,

1581
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:03,870
it seems like too much of an exciting
option for people who are fuck ups and

1582
01:33:03,871 --> 01:33:08,640
there are so many of us,
there's so many of us, you know,

1583
01:33:08,641 --> 01:33:11,490
in one way or another, there's
so many, you know, one,

1584
01:33:11,491 --> 01:33:13,830
one form of fuck up or another.
There's so many of us.

1585
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,860
Yeah, that's true. I mean,

1586
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:21,380
I don't know if that's necessarily the
true for the way that is set up for us to

1587
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:26,300
go. Um, the structure that is now
just doesn't work as much anymore.

1588
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:29,780
It made more sense in
the past, you know? Um,

1589
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:34,810
and also it is and shown and not be sound
because that's the thing that trips me

1590
01:33:34,821 --> 01:33:35,211
out now.

1591
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:39,290
It's like when I was a kid that was
drilled in my head from my mom was good,

1592
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:42,550
a good government job,
get a good government job,

1593
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:47,660
and now that seems like the most
unsteady job you could have,

1594
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:51,720
you know, that just cut your
department. Yeah. You never know. Yeah.

1595
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,290
And so one thing I learned,
um,

1596
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:59,030
the standup taught me quickly was
that it's the same stress, you know,

1597
01:33:59,031 --> 01:34:01,760
but now I'm in charge.
That stress of paying my bills.

1598
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:05,390
The stress of taking care of my son is
the same whether I'm working for somebody

1599
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:08,960
else or I'm working for myself,
but at least when I'm working for myself,

1600
01:34:08,961 --> 01:34:10,610
I'm in charge. Right. You know,

1601
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:13,790
and as long as I have a product
that I can pull it out. If I'm,

1602
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,700
if I don't have anything, then I
guess I got to go work for somebody.

1603
01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:18,440
But if I had something,

1604
01:34:18,441 --> 01:34:22,700
I'd rather have that stress be put on
me then have someone to show up one day

1605
01:34:22,701 --> 01:34:26,420
and be like, we're out of business.
Fine. Find someplace else to work.

1606
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:30,970
Yeah. And you're 60 yeah. Yeah. And
they just cut your whole department.

1607
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:32,613
Well didn't,

1608
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:37,660
I mean every fucking single
politician gets in the office,

1609
01:34:37,661 --> 01:34:40,870
they want to cut certain departments.
Right.

1610
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:44,760
There's always someone that thinks
something's being overfunded and yeah.

1611
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:49,480
That they're just talking about cutting
social security and food stamps.

1612
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:52,750
And I was like, that seems like the
last thing we need right now. Yeah.

1613
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:56,620
If you can make things,
it seems like if you could make things,

1614
01:34:56,650 --> 01:35:00,200
this is like one of the a good time to
be on your own because you could sell

1615
01:35:00,201 --> 01:35:01,130
things on the Internet.

1616
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,250
You could sell things in a way
that no one could ever sell before.

1617
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:06,380
Like you could set up an online store,

1618
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:09,740
you don't have to have a physical
location and you could just, you know,

1619
01:35:09,741 --> 01:35:12,140
if you make something, if
you're an artist, if you're a,

1620
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:16,820
you make pottery or some shit, you could
sell things that you create online.

1621
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:18,710
Like it's pretty easy to do now.

1622
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:23,540
Like this is a place where people can
actually like, oh well if I just did this,

1623
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:26,240
if I figured out a way to do that,
I'm working for myself.

1624
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:29,750
Or You just do it whenever I want
to sell things. People like it,

1625
01:35:29,751 --> 01:35:33,140
they put it in their house and then a
lot of people can go in that direction.

1626
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:34,053
It's not.
I mean,

1627
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,800
there's people that just aren't creative
and they're not interested in it,

1628
01:35:36,801 --> 01:35:38,060
but there's a lot of people are,

1629
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:41,030
and for those people who are just have
a little bit of creativity that they

1630
01:35:41,031 --> 01:35:45,560
maybe never really nurtured because
he will work too much. Find a way,

1631
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,850
find a way, find a way to get
through with that main plus.

1632
01:35:49,851 --> 01:35:52,160
You know who you are because you,
if you,

1633
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:55,920
if your content and how your job
has gone anyway, you're fine.

1634
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,510
You know you're not even
thinking about that,

1635
01:35:57,511 --> 01:36:00,120
but if you're upset and you're
like, oh, I hate this job.

1636
01:36:00,121 --> 01:36:03,480
I hate what's going on my life,
you know that that usually

1637
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:07,060
that might be the case and people love
to say that's easy for you to say.

1638
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,420
It's easy. It's easy for you to say
you guys are both already successful.

1639
01:36:10,421 --> 01:36:13,960
It's very hard to get started.
I get it. I get it. It is hard.

1640
01:36:13,961 --> 01:36:17,590
It is 100% I get it,
but don't think like that.

1641
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:21,160
Just try to find a way through.
The more time you spend thinking on it,

1642
01:36:21,161 --> 01:36:24,550
that's easy for you. I know. It's hard
for me. The more time you do that,

1643
01:36:24,551 --> 01:36:27,190
the less time you're thinking
of an actual solution. Yeah.

1644
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:29,500
You see the,
I see that all the time.

1645
01:36:29,501 --> 01:36:33,850
Especially even like with my weight loss
and stuff, people um, there are like,

1646
01:36:33,851 --> 01:36:35,920
oh you could say that you got,
you got to train her.

1647
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:40,080
And it's just like I still had, I still
had the be the guy that vomited. True.

1648
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:40,720
You know,

1649
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:45,250
I still had to be the guy that worked
myself so hard that I threw up and still

1650
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:45,760
win

1651
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:50,760
back. You know, it's like on the ground
or did you make it to a trash can?

1652
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:55,390
The trash can. Not at wrestling. At
wrestling. I as an on the ground. Oh No.

1653
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:59,870
Yeah, cause then they made me clean it up
and I'm like, it's part of the Gig. Yeah,

1654
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,740
it really was.

1655
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,730
He can't be puking.
[inaudible] yeah man.

1656
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:06,860
If you're working out to the
point of puking, that's intense.

1657
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:11,090
Well, you know, when my body was
coming from places such an activity.

1658
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:15,310
Yeah. How long do you think it took you
for you to adjust to a constant state of

1659
01:37:15,311 --> 01:37:18,520
activity? Probably like six months.
That's a great thing though,

1660
01:37:18,521 --> 01:37:22,150
that you had the discipline to do that.
That's a great thing. It really is. It's,

1661
01:37:22,151 --> 01:37:25,030
um,
it's an underappreciated thing cause it's,

1662
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,060
I think it's easy for me to keep
doing what I'm doing. I always do it.

1663
01:37:28,061 --> 01:37:30,010
It's part of my natural way of doing it,

1664
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:34,600
but to not exercise and then decide
you're going to clean your diet up and

1665
01:37:34,601 --> 01:37:37,540
you're going to start exercising and
you're going to continually do it even

1666
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:40,660
though you're exhausted because your
body's not really prepared for this.

1667
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:45,220
So you must have had a long period of
like, uh, for a couple of weeks at least,

1668
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:48,700
what you're like having your
body try to respond to this,

1669
01:37:48,701 --> 01:37:52,420
where it didn't have to do this before
and now you're making it stress out all

1670
01:37:52,421 --> 01:37:55,420
the time and it's got to recover and
then you stress it out and it's kind of

1671
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:56,263
recover.
And then

1672
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:58,770
he bought, he's like, what the
fuck dude? What is happening here?

1673
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:04,130
Is this our new life? Yeah. Yeah. No,
that was pretty much that. You can you,

1674
01:38:04,131 --> 01:38:08,520
and you nailed it. How long did it take,
um, to lose, to get to where I am now?

1675
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:12,390
The to where you started feeling
comfortable with like normal exercise on a

1676
01:38:12,391 --> 01:38:16,320
regular basis or extreme strenuous
exercise, strenuous exercising again,

1677
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:20,760
I think it'd be about, about,
about six months of where I um,

1678
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:24,060
and then also just their weight goals.
You know,

1679
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:28,700
I was about three 60 when
we started it. And then, um,

1680
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,880
get an under three 50 was
just like a real difference.

1681
01:38:32,881 --> 01:38:36,360
And then when I got into 300,
that was a big deal.

1682
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:39,050
And then when I got under two 50,
um,

1683
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:44,280
and then now like now I'm about
to 20 and anytime I go over to 25,

1684
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:47,540
I can feel it in my knees again.
And um,

1685
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:51,000
cause I had to take a little
break for a few weeks and um,

1686
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:55,200
but now and that was really big
on my mind because I was like, oh,

1687
01:38:55,201 --> 01:38:57,030
I have to take a break for three weeks.

1688
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:00,810
Am I going to just blow up again?
You know,

1689
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:04,740
and going through that and seeing that
I can keep my diet and keep my nutrition

1690
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:09,450
and that I got a little
less defined but I wasn't,

1691
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:10,830
I didn't blow up and I was like,

1692
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:15,831
okay that made me relax a little bit more
and it's helped me as far as my comedy

1693
01:39:16,381 --> 01:39:17,220
or dealing with

1694
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:23,280
executives and stuff or I am
very much like, oh I needed that.

1695
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,780
Like I can, I can figure things out,
I can do it. I have the discipline.

1696
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:32,610
If I really set my mind to something
I can usually do it. Yeah, that's a,

1697
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:37,420
it's a giant accomplishment and
people undermine it because um,

1698
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:41,520
they feel like it doesn't mean as much
because you let yourself get to that

1699
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:44,700
weight. And I think it's a silly
way of looking at it because

1700
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:51,110
I am a firm believer that many of us who
are feeling really good about life and

1701
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:54,450
having a great time here are v very,

1702
01:39:54,451 --> 01:39:58,950
very lucky in their
circumstance. Very lucky in, in,

1703
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:03,480
in the people you're around,
the positive influences in your life,

1704
01:40:03,481 --> 01:40:07,890
the good things, very lucky cause
shit can be really not good.

1705
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,860
And when things are really not
good and people go down the spiral,

1706
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:16,100
whether it's with booze and cigarettes
and heroin or whether it's with food or

1707
01:40:16,771 --> 01:40:19,890
whether it's with alcohol or
whether it's whatever, the pills,

1708
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:21,480
if you can go down a spiral,

1709
01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:26,510
it's who out of the person that is in
the bottom of the spiral who can pull

1710
01:40:27,181 --> 01:40:29,370
themselves out.
Could you,

1711
01:40:29,371 --> 01:40:32,460
if you had to start from there instead
of starting from a place of success,

1712
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:35,730
and this is why I think people get cocky.
You wake up every morning like, oh,

1713
01:40:35,731 --> 01:40:38,700
I guess everything's okay. You
know, my life's not in the shitter.

1714
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:43,590
Instead think of what it would be like
if you woke up and you were 380 pounds

1715
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,060
and this is your new life.

1716
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:50,180
Your new life is you got to get down
from 380 pounds to about 220 pounds.

1717
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:55,480
You got to figure out how to do and
you've got to figure out how to not lapse.

1718
01:40:55,481 --> 01:40:59,380
When you're aching with hunger, you've
got to figure out how how your your,

1719
01:40:59,381 --> 01:41:02,170
your body has no fucking energy.
It doesn't know how to recover.

1720
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,470
It never gets pushed and you have to
push it through that and you have to do

1721
01:41:05,471 --> 01:41:09,820
that to the tune of 160 pounds.

1722
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:14,410
A lot of fucking weight, man,
that's a lot of fucking weight.

1723
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:18,220
Most people are not going to be able to
do that. It's a lot of weight to lose.

1724
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:19,623
How long did that take you?

1725
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:23,040
Um,
about two and a half years.

1726
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:29,400
That's a, no matter what, that's
an accomplishment, man. You know?

1727
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:34,560
And it's something that I think that
when people hear that, that you did,

1728
01:41:34,561 --> 01:41:38,610
that people realize like, I
can do that too. I can do that.

1729
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,900
That can be done. Yeah. That's been
one of the best things about it.

1730
01:41:42,901 --> 01:41:47,280
And what it actually keeps me on it is
when I get people reaching out to me.

1731
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:51,750
Like when I post pictures from the past
or, and now and they're like, man, like,

1732
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:55,500
you know, in some ways the use of piss
me out because if people are being like,

1733
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:58,950
Oh, if you can do it then I can
definitely do it. But now it's like,

1734
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,510
it's very motivating.

1735
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:05,960
Yeah. It's, you're setting an
example, you know, you, um, you,

1736
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:08,600
you do something and then people,

1737
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:11,090
because you're in the public
eye and he'd do this thing.

1738
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:15,050
They see you do it there, watch
it happen. You know? I mean,

1739
01:42:15,051 --> 01:42:19,250
it's one of the cooler things about it.
Like you go in real time,

1740
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:24,390
he could see you two years ago. You could
see you now. I mean, it's crazy. You want,

1741
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:29,950
you really did it, you know? And
when people see that they, and the,

1742
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:33,770
it's not like if you heard that a guy
lost 400 pounds who are like, wow,

1743
01:42:33,771 --> 01:42:34,604
that's amazing.

1744
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:38,570
But if you see a guy and you watch them
on a regular basis and he's 400 pounds

1745
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,890
and then all of a sudden he loses all
that way. You like what? Look at him.

1746
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:47,840
Watch him do it. You see
him do it. Something about
people needing to see shit.

1747
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:51,170
Like we need to see someone else do
it. And then we can go, I can do that.

1748
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,510
You know?
Yeah.

1749
01:42:52,910 --> 01:42:56,570
Would you ever even imagine if you
didn't know the people ran marathons,

1750
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:57,890
ultra marathons,

1751
01:42:57,891 --> 01:43:02,270
would you ever even imagine that you
would want to just run a hundred miles?

1752
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:06,200
No. You'd be like, what the fuck are
you talking about? No one's doing that.

1753
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:11,450
But then you hear about it and
you see it and he'd go, oh,

1754
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:14,990
I still don't want to do.
He still don't want to do it.

1755
01:43:14,991 --> 01:43:19,250
But it changes your idea
of what people do. Yeah.

1756
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:23,640
Oh yeah. Oh, what's capable? Right. So
when a guy like you lose all that way,

1757
01:43:23,641 --> 01:43:28,130
it changes people's idea of what if they
may be identify with you a change of

1758
01:43:28,131 --> 01:43:31,180
their idea about what they're capable of.
They changed their,

1759
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:36,230
their opinion of those themselves based
on you pulling your life together in an

1760
01:43:36,441 --> 01:43:40,530
awesome way publicly.
Nice. Thank you dude.

1761
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:44,660
That's dope. That's, that has
a powerful impact on people.

1762
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:46,250
You know,
this academy,

1763
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:50,540
a lot of dudes out there and gals that
are trying to figure the fuck out of the

1764
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:54,500
hole. They themselves in,
you know, they're like, how
did I get out of this? Like,

1765
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:57,170
how do I, Jesus Christ. I
hate being tired all the time.

1766
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:02,230
No, that's why my, um, that's
one of the things I love my top,

1767
01:44:02,231 --> 01:44:07,120
I'll allow my park has, is, and I
try it cause people don't know me,

1768
01:44:07,121 --> 01:44:08,350
you know,
and that time on Twitter,

1769
01:44:08,351 --> 01:44:11,990
if I'm like if I try to give a visor
things or I'm not even really advised,

1770
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:14,600
just try and be positive.
People go thank you.

1771
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,650
Talking about like what do you know,
what do you care?

1772
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:20,200
You run on a TV show and I have to
go like you don't know my history.

1773
01:44:20,201 --> 01:44:21,820
You don't know where I came from.

1774
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,690
You don't know that I'm like I'm a
single dad of this kid with a disability.

1775
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:29,200
I take care of them myself.
I was boring as crap.

1776
01:44:29,201 --> 01:44:34,201
I had had three weeks of a
college community college
education and I had once I

1777
01:44:36,761 --> 01:44:37,720
like, it was like, oh,

1778
01:44:37,721 --> 01:44:41,860
I got to pull my life together for this
son who is different from other people

1779
01:44:41,861 --> 01:44:46,570
and I don't know if he's ever going to
be able to live on his own or are have

1780
01:44:46,571 --> 01:44:51,280
his own job or I have to prepare for not,
I had to prepare that if he does,

1781
01:44:51,281 --> 01:44:52,180
if he needs help.

1782
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:56,410
I had a pair of payer for all of these
things and it really motivated me and it

1783
01:44:56,411 --> 01:45:01,390
pushed me forward. And I like
to, um, now for some reason I,

1784
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:05,170
I dunno if it's like survivor's remorse
or whatever, I'm always like, man,

1785
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,920
I feel like so many people can do that,
you know,

1786
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:10,630
not necessarily comedy or whatever,

1787
01:45:10,631 --> 01:45:12,670
but I always feel like
people have their own gifts,

1788
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:16,780
they have their own talents and sometimes
we're not told that we're not pushed

1789
01:45:16,781 --> 01:45:19,120
in.
Those directions are sometimes where we,

1790
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:23,800
we go through traumas or things in our
lives that damn our light, you know,

1791
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,620
and I like to be like,
you.

1792
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:31,710
Anybody can do it because I'm a testament
to that because I should not be here.

1793
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:35,370
Well you, you should because
you chose the right path.

1794
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:40,020
This is what's really critical about
this kind of what, when we, you know,

1795
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,860
we talk about people's future
or what they can and can't do.

1796
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:47,340
One of the beautiful things about
standup is that it's a meritocracy.

1797
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,610
You're really funny. People love
you. You're not like, that's,

1798
01:45:50,611 --> 01:45:54,300
we just want to know you funny. Hey, is
that guy funny? He's funny. Come on in.

1799
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:58,830
Is she funny? She's funny. Okay,
come on in. We'll just, that's it.

1800
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:04,020
And I don't know of that many
other jobs where it's that clear.

1801
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,010
There's a lot of jobs we got to do.

1802
01:46:06,011 --> 01:46:09,060
All I ask is that you got
to suck that corporate dick.

1803
01:46:09,061 --> 01:46:10,800
You got to be in the
office with Satan going,

1804
01:46:10,801 --> 01:46:14,970
what the fuck am I doing with my life?
I don't want to be here. You know,

1805
01:46:14,971 --> 01:46:18,560
I'm writing down goals. I just want
to do coke. I want to get a Ferrari.

1806
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:21,210
Fuck this job. You know? That's
what a lot of it is, man.

1807
01:46:21,211 --> 01:46:23,580
There's a lot of like weird adjuncts,
you know,

1808
01:46:23,581 --> 01:46:27,890
and then you get stuck in this fucking
corporate ladder. You get muted,

1809
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:29,790
you get toned down.
There's no,

1810
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:34,770
there's no deviation from the
standard office worker path. You know,

1811
01:46:34,771 --> 01:46:37,050
you're in this weird groove,
whereas it is the stand up.

1812
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:40,320
All you gotta do is make the people laugh.
All you gotta do is find this shit.

1813
01:46:40,321 --> 01:46:43,740
It's funny. Work on it makes people laugh.
Get out there, get out there, boom, boom,

1814
01:46:43,741 --> 01:46:47,820
boom. Oh Shit. You got to go see Ron
Funches. Oh Shit. People start talking.

1815
01:46:47,970 --> 01:46:50,130
People start telling other friends.
The next thing you go,

1816
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,900
there's agents, there's
managers. You keep going,

1817
01:46:51,901 --> 01:46:54,750
you keep going and keep getting better.
Oh my God, you're on TV. Look at you.

1818
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:55,980
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

1819
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:58,740
If you just keep going and working at
it like nobody tells us what to do,

1820
01:46:59,190 --> 01:47:01,350
it's fucking beautiful,
but not everybody can get that Gig.

1821
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:04,140
So then there's other gigs
like what Gig do you take?

1822
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,590
It seems like you should take the
gig where you make a lot of money,

1823
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:10,770
but that's not the move.

1824
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:12,870
It's not the move and less you can,

1825
01:47:12,890 --> 01:47:16,950
your can be sure that you can quit that
Gig in a short period of time because

1826
01:47:16,951 --> 01:47:17,790
nobody ever does.

1827
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:22,470
Yeah. Right. Trap jobs allow is, we'll put
them and they had a lot of them were at,

1828
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:26,580
where I grew up with is, is this bank
call center where I was working, um,

1829
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:31,510
because it was the only place, this tiny
town, not many jobs like unless you were,

1830
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:34,420
if you didn't have a college education
you were working at, at subway,

1831
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:36,370
you work in a Sam goody are,

1832
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:39,940
are you a working at this bank and
you were making like 20 bucks an hour.

1833
01:47:39,941 --> 01:47:43,240
You're making like double what
you're making at the subway. But

1834
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:44,530
dude

1835
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:47,440
skills that transfer.
So if you want to leave this job,

1836
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:50,410
you got you going back to
the subway and you know,

1837
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:52,630
so there's a lot of people
end up trapped there.

1838
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:56,740
And I knew right away I was like, I
gotta get out. I can't, I mean, Hey,

1839
01:47:56,741 --> 01:48:00,950
I'm not a bank die. Uh,
so you know, that's a trap

1840
01:48:01,970 --> 01:48:04,730
trap man.
I remember when I was a kid,

1841
01:48:04,731 --> 01:48:09,050
I was working at this place called Newport
creamery. It was an ice cream store.

1842
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:12,620
Like w they sold ice cream and hamburgers
and shit like that and there was a

1843
01:48:12,621 --> 01:48:13,910
bank that was like right next door.

1844
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:17,420
I would always go in the bank with my
Newport creamery check and I deposit it

1845
01:48:17,421 --> 01:48:22,100
and I'd say, hi, this lady.
And then one day I heard, uh,

1846
01:48:22,190 --> 01:48:27,190
she had the baby in the toilet and then
left it in a garbage bin and no one even

1847
01:48:28,881 --> 01:48:33,150
knew she was pregnant.
And it was one of those like what?

1848
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:38,720
Like we had just a window into madness
like right next door to where we were

1849
01:48:38,721 --> 01:48:41,080
working. We were like, what?

1850
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:46,010
That lady that we always said
hi to and the lady got pregnant,

1851
01:48:46,011 --> 01:48:51,011
didn't tell anybody and gave birth in the
bathroom at work and put the baby in a

1852
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:54,950
dumpster.
Dude,

1853
01:48:56,030 --> 01:49:00,170
I wish you hadn't led with this with a
bank story was a bank story and it was

1854
01:49:00,171 --> 01:49:03,710
just a person person working. She could,
if she could have been at a cupcake shop,

1855
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:06,920
it was just, this was a person,
this is a person who was mad.

1856
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:09,380
There were crazy person.
Right. You have to be,

1857
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:13,160
you'd would have to be a crazy version
where no one knows you're pregnant and

1858
01:49:13,161 --> 01:49:16,280
then you give birth in a bathroom and the
baby winds up in a dumpster. It's like,

1859
01:49:16,281 --> 01:49:21,200
that is, that's the most insane shit
I've ever heard in my life. Yeah.

1860
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:24,380
And that was like right next door to the
ice cream place. And we were all like,

1861
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:28,850
whoa. It's like the fabric, the
fabric of reality had rippled.

1862
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:32,510
We realize like someone can
be that crazy in your town,

1863
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:36,140
in your fucking town right there.

1864
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:39,800
Hi De your town. Oh Man. You
sound like a nice town. No,

1865
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:44,650
it was a nice towel. It what
I mean, it was a very idealic

1866
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:48,730
pretty sheltered up until
people put in babies and things.

1867
01:49:49,110 --> 01:49:53,340
Well, just, it was a, it wasn't
a big place, you know. And, um,

1868
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:57,720
when something would go wrong,
it would be odd. You know, like,

1869
01:49:57,721 --> 01:49:58,680
you knew the person

1870
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:03,100
I know it's shelter is because you
were worked at a place called creamery

1871
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:04,090
Newport creamery

1872
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:10,390
ice cream for shelter.
Yeah.

1873
01:50:10,391 --> 01:50:13,180
That was a sheltered ASP.
Beautiful. I want him to do that.

1874
01:50:13,181 --> 01:50:15,190
I want to make that a reality from my,

1875
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,210
no, it was a nice place to grow up. Um,

1876
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:22,520
and I had lived in Jamaica plain
before that, which was much, uh,

1877
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:24,810
much worse neighborhood.
It was sketchy.

1878
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:28,620
We lived there for about a year
and then my parents were like,

1879
01:50:28,621 --> 01:50:29,970
we gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

1880
01:50:29,971 --> 01:50:34,740
Like people breaking into cars and while
you're sleeping and how home break ins.

1881
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:35,970
And it was just a lot of crime,

1882
01:50:36,690 --> 01:50:40,740
especially in like 1978 or
whatever the fuck it was.

1883
01:50:41,670 --> 01:50:46,290
I guess it was like Haiti. Yeah. So
then we moved to Newton, which is nice.

1884
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:50,550
Are Your parents still around? Yeah.
Yeah. They're still together. My step,

1885
01:50:50,551 --> 01:50:53,070
my stepdad and my mom are still together.

1886
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:58,090
They've been together since I was a
little kid. They're a nice couple. Okay.

1887
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:01,400
Have a good time together.
Yeah, I uh, you know,

1888
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:04,590
do you ever wonder what you're going to
be like when you like 75 year old man?

1889
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:07,290
Yeah.
What do you think that'd be cool as fuck.

1890
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,360
Cause I mean I don't,

1891
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:14,850
I don't give a fuck mostly
now and imagine later. Right.

1892
01:51:14,851 --> 01:51:19,200
Even less just saying all types of
stuff. I see it in my mom, you know,

1893
01:51:19,201 --> 01:51:24,201
my mom especially is fine because I can
take her to like random events that I go

1894
01:51:24,481 --> 01:51:28,530
to and she just, I try
to be cool, you know,

1895
01:51:28,531 --> 01:51:32,010
cause I'm working and she has none
of that cause she doesn't care.

1896
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:36,770
Like my mom's sexually harass
Justin Timberlake. It was great.

1897
01:51:38,550 --> 01:51:41,160
It was,
security was about to take her out.

1898
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:46,470
She just doesn't care. Have you ever had
our guests on your podcast? Yeah. Yeah.

1899
01:51:46,471 --> 01:51:50,370
She was the second guess or the first or
second episode? Yeah. It's always, yeah.

1900
01:51:50,371 --> 01:51:54,860
My Mom's, yeah. I learn a lot from my mom
and she's super dope. And now she's um,

1901
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:58,450
smoking a lot of pot and just, she lived
down. Oh, she lives with you now? Yeah.

1902
01:51:58,451 --> 01:52:00,840
She lives in the Pool House and hangs out.

1903
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:04,920
Did you get depressed and in Portland
with the weather did freak out.

1904
01:52:05,610 --> 01:52:09,810
Yeah. You did seasonal depression there.
Yeah. Easily. Yeah. People say it's real.

1905
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:13,110
They say even if you take vitamin
D and sit in a tanning bed, yeah.

1906
01:52:13,111 --> 01:52:15,900
I mean they'll show you those
lights and all those things,

1907
01:52:15,901 --> 01:52:17,820
but she doesn't do it though, does it? No,

1908
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:20,460
not when you're dealing with
three months of straight gray.

1909
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:25,820
It's the rain, not just gray. Oh,

1910
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:29,730
because there's this lack of
color palette in your life. Yes.

1911
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:32,180
You don't get the vibrance. Yeah. Yeah.

1912
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:35,430
When the ocean looks like a d a dull gray.

1913
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:40,320
Yeah.
Even the ocean looks tired like oh right.

1914
01:52:40,321 --> 01:52:41,670
As opposed to like if you go to

1915
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,840
Mexico, like, uh,

1916
01:52:43,841 --> 01:52:48,740
I went to Cancun way back in the day and
the first thing I noticed like how the

1917
01:52:48,741 --> 01:52:53,060
fuck is the ocean? That color?
Like, look how pretty it is. Yeah.

1918
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:56,930
It's like all bluish green.
That's gorgeous. Yeah.

1919
01:52:56,931 --> 01:53:00,320
If you ever been to the
French Riviera, no. Oh my God.

1920
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:04,670
You want a time when and yeah, same
thing. They have a pebble beaches,

1921
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:08,110
the sand, which is a horrible, but,

1922
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:14,720
but the water is so
beautiful. It's crazy. Yeah.

1923
01:53:14,721 --> 01:53:17,240
I grew up, um, in that town,

1924
01:53:17,241 --> 01:53:20,480
which was next to the Charles River
and the Charles River went all the way

1925
01:53:20,481 --> 01:53:24,810
through Boston. And the Charles River
was like disgusting man. Like you'd,

1926
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:29,390
you see condoms floating in it and you'd
see I saw one pipe and this bubbles

1927
01:53:29,391 --> 01:53:31,310
were coming up to the surface. I
was like, what the fuck is that?

1928
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:35,060
And then I saw a condom bubble up and
I went, oh my God, it's a sewer pipe.

1929
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:38,840
And I realized someone was just flushing
their shit and piss right into the

1930
01:53:38,841 --> 01:53:43,220
Goddamn river. Oh, like how did
this happen? And I was, you know,

1931
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:47,990
14 and I'm like, what the fuck is this?
Like how the, how am I finding this?

1932
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:53,150
Like you don't have anybody likes checking
to see if the shit pipe is right into

1933
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:56,000
the Goddamn river. Like,
oh my God, it was crazy.

1934
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:58,670
So it wasn't clean by any
stretch of the imagination.

1935
01:53:58,671 --> 01:54:01,850
So to see that kind of a clean,

1936
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:06,970
pure like ocean water where like
you were a heard a bone fishing.

1937
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:10,250
Do you know what that is? It's a
type of fishing that people do. It's,

1938
01:54:10,251 --> 01:54:12,040
I think they mostly just
catch and release them.

1939
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:16,450
I don't think they even keep most of them,
but they go to Florida and I the,

1940
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:21,440
I think The Bahamas wants to The Bahamas
and they are on these like special

1941
01:54:21,441 --> 01:54:24,170
boats that are like, uh, these uh,

1942
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:29,200
boats you can stand on and their fly
fishing for this fish that looks like it

1943
01:54:29,331 --> 01:54:32,120
belongs in the stone age.
It's weird,

1944
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:36,080
cool looking fish called the bonefish.
See if he could pull up a picture of it.

1945
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:39,110
I don't know why we're talking about this.
That's how high am,

1946
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:41,350
that's what the law,
that's cool.

1947
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:46,100
Is that a bonefish smoke
small like a Barracuda?

1948
01:54:47,390 --> 01:54:50,600
That's a bonefish. See that's a bone
first. That other one was a barracuda.

1949
01:54:50,601 --> 01:54:54,050
I think they just had a bad photo.
You see the difference? Like it's,

1950
01:54:54,110 --> 01:54:57,590
it's a crazy look in Fishman
and see that water behind them.

1951
01:54:57,591 --> 01:54:58,760
It's hard to tell from this image,

1952
01:54:58,761 --> 01:55:02,300
but what we're looking as really shallow
water like at the most it's like three

1953
01:55:02,301 --> 01:55:03,140
feet deep,
right?

1954
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:06,590
And they're just casting out and they
see these fish coming towards them and

1955
01:55:06,591 --> 01:55:10,190
they catch it. It's supposed
to be like super, super
exciting. You do love fishing.

1956
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:14,270
I don't do a lot of fishing but I love
fishing. It's fun. But this is fun.

1957
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:17,540
Like I would assume, I've haven't done
this kind of fishing bone fishing,

1958
01:55:17,541 --> 01:55:19,100
but that's what people,
people love.

1959
01:55:19,101 --> 01:55:23,210
Like seeing a fish coming and going and
biting your lore like it's very exciting.

1960
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:27,220
Yeah. It's sad to say, but look how clear
that goddamn water is. It was no clue.

1961
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,170
There's no condoms.
She says bonefish.

1962
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:35,150
I was watching a video today of a guy
jumping with scuba gear on into the

1963
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:39,680
garbage patch. It's the middle of the
Pacific Ocean. You know? I had knew,

1964
01:55:39,710 --> 01:55:42,650
I knew that it is supposed to
be like horrific, but once you,

1965
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:45,630
when you see it in a video,
you're watching just go,

1966
01:55:45,631 --> 01:55:48,540
what the fuck is this?

1967
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:53,400
This guy put scuba gear on and jumped
into this. I mean is it was plastic,

1968
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:56,430
you couldn't see anything but plastic
everywhere you look to the left and the

1969
01:55:56,431 --> 01:55:59,130
right, it was all plastic.
Like this is huge.

1970
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:03,810
Like several states, large. Yeah.

1971
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:08,940
This shit, this is what
humans are doing to the ocean.

1972
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:13,830
This is, this is a, would you
see them jump in and it's almost,

1973
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:16,730
did they show him jump in or is
this a different video is different.

1974
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:19,320
There's a different video
cause the other one,

1975
01:56:19,321 --> 01:56:20,830
the guy starts out on the boat and,

1976
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:25,170
and dives in and what he dives
into is just like plastic soup.

1977
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:29,400
It's fucking disgusting man.
It's crazy. Yeah. Like this.

1978
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:31,663
Um,

1979
01:56:32,010 --> 01:56:35,940
so there's this guy that we had on
the podcast name is boy on slot and he

1980
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:40,970
created a device that he's using to try
to pull the plastic out of the ocean and

1981
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:45,750
they'll maybe convert that plastic
and to know things that we can use.

1982
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:50,850
And um, there, I don't think it worked
on the first attempt, but they're,

1983
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:53,250
they're relaunching it, right? Didn't he?

1984
01:56:53,330 --> 01:56:55,490
They had to do something to
fix things there. You know,

1985
01:56:55,491 --> 01:56:57,450
it's still in like sort
of the prototype stage.

1986
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,210
But he's going to have these machines.

1987
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:04,100
There's giant net move around through the
ocean and catch all these plastic yeah.

1988
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:08,250
Bay from getting fish.
That's a very good question.

1989
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,710
I don't think there's any
fish living in there. Um,

1990
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:15,600
I bet a lot of fish have eaten
that stuff though. Guaranteed.

1991
01:57:15,601 --> 01:57:18,030
This is probably a lot of fish
with plastic in their stomachs. Oh,

1992
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:22,410
a hundred percent. Yeah man,
that's gross. I mean what,

1993
01:57:22,590 --> 01:57:25,800
what kind of shit gets in their system
and then when you eat that fish,

1994
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:27,870
what kind of shit are you
getting in your system?

1995
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:32,610
How many people were testing their fish?
You know, I mean how many people are, uh,

1996
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:34,500
before they eat a Sam and they're like,
hold on,

1997
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:38,160
let me check for mercury and let me
see what, how much arsenics in this.

1998
01:57:38,710 --> 01:57:40,080
So we kind of heavy metal party.

1999
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:42,810
What sets up bpps that they're
worried about the come from?

2000
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:47,490
What does the stuff they're worried about?
The comes from bottles. Plastic? Yeah.

2001
01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:52,500
[inaudible] or something like that. I wish
I knew what that meant. Guess they did,

2002
01:57:52,830 --> 01:57:57,210
they did their first results
from November. I don't
know what he's saying. Oh,

2003
01:57:57,211 --> 01:57:58,350
so this is their first,
uh,

2004
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:04,020
their first actual pulling of the garbage,
you know,

2005
01:58:04,021 --> 01:58:08,550
listen man, even if it takes 10 years,
if they could figure out a way to,

2006
01:58:08,750 --> 01:58:12,120
to get rid of all that plastic and we
could figure out a way to not put that

2007
01:58:12,121 --> 01:58:14,010
plastic in the ocean and we can,
maybe,

2008
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:18,990
what I really worry about almost as much
as this maybe even more, is overfishing.

2009
01:58:20,990 --> 01:58:25,990
When you realize how many different
ships are out there using giant nets and

2010
01:58:26,211 --> 01:58:31,211
just scooping everything they catch inside
that net and then just serving it to

2011
01:58:31,221 --> 01:58:34,820
us and we were like, who you want to get
Sushi? Yeah, Sushi sounds good. You know,

2012
01:58:34,821 --> 01:58:38,480
we're like so close. He's just
sounds good. It's ocean genocide.

2013
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:41,830
I mean it's fucking chaotic.
Man. Did they don't have real,

2014
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:44,920
I mean they don't have real control.
It's international waters.

2015
01:58:44,921 --> 01:58:48,520
People were just cut and nets and dropping
them to the bottom of the ocean and

2016
01:58:48,521 --> 01:58:51,430
the catching things all the time.
There's nets all over the place out there.

2017
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:54,400
He would just release their nets.
They just litter.

2018
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:55,311
But you're always,

2019
01:58:55,311 --> 01:59:00,110
you've been very conscious about like
what you eat and like sustainability a lot

2020
01:59:00,111 --> 01:59:00,944
lately,
right?

2021
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:04,500
Well I think sustainability. Yeah,
I do think about that a lot. Um,

2022
01:59:04,590 --> 01:59:06,090
I don't know if I'm that conscious of it.

2023
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:10,800
I'm definitely guilty of
not being sometimes hungry
dream the unconscious about

2024
01:59:10,801 --> 01:59:14,100
it. I wish I was more conscious
back cause I'm putting my faith.

2025
01:59:14,101 --> 01:59:16,560
It makes me all sad. Yeah. I'm more,

2026
01:59:16,570 --> 01:59:18,990
I'm more conscious about
what I eat and I am uh,

2027
01:59:19,170 --> 01:59:21,660
sustainability in terms of
like the quality of what I eat.

2028
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:25,080
I'm more conscious about that. I should
be more conscious about sustainability,

2029
01:59:25,081 --> 01:59:28,050
but sometimes it feels like, what does
this, what are you showing me here?

2030
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:31,260
Is that a crocodile? God
Damn it. What is a big, big

2031
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:33,830
catch with an exclamation mark
is the name of the fish guy.

2032
01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:38,470
40 million views on youtube.
It's a net that's full of stuff.

2033
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,270
Oh, they caught a net. Oh, this is, oh, a
net, right. This is a fishing boat. Yeah.

2034
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:45,390
Oh Jesus. Yeah. Look at
that. Look how it works.

2035
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:49,140
They just scoop up every fucking
thing that's in that ocean.

2036
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:55,290
It's really amazing that they fee.
I mean, what a horrific place to be.

2037
01:59:55,291 --> 01:59:57,360
If you're a fish,
imagine if fish,

2038
01:59:57,810 --> 02:00:01,980
we're like super smart
and this is their demise.

2039
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:06,690
I mean this is an insane net filled with
living creatures that were going to eat.

2040
02:00:07,890 --> 02:00:12,570
Not Bro. It's just tilapia. Relax.
God, you're kidding. So dramatic.

2041
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:14,160
Look at that.

2042
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:18,660
That's a crazy bundle of
these ocean creatures.

2043
02:00:18,661 --> 02:00:23,310
And how often does this happen? A
day. Is it all day? I bet it is.

2044
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:25,500
I bet this is all day.

2045
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:30,980
I bet this is all day for years
and years and years and years.

2046
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:34,860
And I don't think they take time off. I
think they keep going and if they're not,

2047
02:00:34,861 --> 02:00:37,710
they're someone else's there too.
And I think this is happening.

2048
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:41,700
As long as they can make money selling
fish and we're willing to buy fish.

2049
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:43,500
It's kind of insane.

2050
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:47,010
You think people ever feel bad about it?
If any of those people feel bad,

2051
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:48,190
maybe it's

2052
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:52,070
possible. They're not monsters, right?
If they're, they might develop, uh Oh,

2053
02:00:52,071 --> 02:00:55,390
that guy just stepped right on a fish
though. Yeah, they get desensitized.

2054
02:00:55,500 --> 02:01:00,010
I'm sure. Man. Anything like he
cared. Oh well this is crazy. I mean,

2055
02:01:00,011 --> 02:01:03,370
this is not a person's supposed to be
able to catch a fish or a two fish or

2056
02:01:03,371 --> 02:01:07,600
three fish and then you eat
it. Like this is chaos, man.

2057
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:12,010
This is some crazy thing where you have
to make filet of fish sandwiches because

2058
02:01:12,011 --> 02:01:16,780
there's, you know, 320 million people
and a hundred of them, 100 million of,

2059
02:01:16,781 --> 02:01:19,120
we want junk food anytime they want it.
I mean,

2060
02:01:19,121 --> 02:01:22,690
I don't know if that went to filet a
fish or if that's a expensive fish.

2061
02:01:22,691 --> 02:01:25,690
I really have no idea. I'm just
talking shit. Don't listen to me. But,

2062
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:27,700
and I also eat fish,
so I'm a hypocrite.

2063
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,830
But it is kind of crazy when you watch
this video and I'm not, you know,

2064
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:35,770
I, uh, I'm not opposed to eating fish,

2065
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:39,440
but I'm just saying the reality
of what this is is, is crazy.

2066
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:42,530
This is a crazy scene and to
not deny it's a crazy scene.

2067
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:46,640
I'm still going to eat fish and I feel,
I feel awful about this.

2068
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:51,980
It does slightly make me want Sushi.
I looking at this,

2069
02:01:51,981 --> 02:01:55,280
it's crazy. When I was a server,
like a big question question.

2070
02:01:55,281 --> 02:01:59,450
People always ask us at farm raised or
is it wild caught and like this is wild

2071
02:01:59,451 --> 02:02:02,360
caught versus farmers. I don't know
why it would make a giant difference.

2072
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:06,980
It just seems like bad either way tell
no matter what for these organisms,

2073
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:09,740
but they're delicious and
they're really good for you.

2074
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:15,260
But how, how are they going to ensure
that there's gonna be some left?

2075
02:02:15,261 --> 02:02:19,910
That's what's crazy. Like the, the human
governments need to get together and go,

2076
02:02:19,911 --> 02:02:20,151
hey,

2077
02:02:20,151 --> 02:02:25,100
we can't kill the whole ocean because
that is possible if you keep going at the

2078
02:02:25,101 --> 02:02:26,570
pace that it's going now,

2079
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:29,540
if you really stop and think about what
the ocean must have been like when you

2080
02:02:29,541 --> 02:02:32,060
hear about those, uh,
Japanese tuna fishermen,

2081
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:35,000
like did you see Jiro Dreams of Sushi?

2082
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:37,790
Remember when those gentlemen were at
the fish market and they were talking

2083
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:41,070
about what it used to be like, I used
to be tuna everywhere, so much tuna.

2084
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:44,030
Now it's like a small amount and you
got to check to see if it's good.

2085
02:02:44,031 --> 02:02:46,400
Like they're watching it
happening in real time.

2086
02:02:46,990 --> 02:02:51,990
If you go from that point where that guy
was talking about today and then go 50

2087
02:02:52,041 --> 02:02:56,960
years from now at the
same pace, like, yeah,

2088
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:58,430
now you gotta be,

2089
02:02:58,550 --> 02:03:02,540
but it seems like that it wouldn't be
that hard to be more conscious about it.

2090
02:03:02,810 --> 02:03:07,310
Well, it the very least, they have to
take into consideration the fact that, uh,

2091
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:11,630
they need to maybe develop some sort of
an international program to breed these

2092
02:03:11,631 --> 02:03:16,160
things, you know, to, to, to like they,
they've done that with yellow tail, the,

2093
02:03:16,161 --> 02:03:19,910
they have these like a
ocean sort of almost like a,

2094
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:23,120
like corralled in area and
they're out in the ocean,

2095
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:27,200
but they're only in this one trapped
area and they're feeding them, you know,

2096
02:03:27,201 --> 02:03:30,590
and occasionally they'd get out, like
they get those yellow tails in Hawaii,

2097
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:33,870
there was a storm and the storm wreck
their little enclosure and they got out

2098
02:03:33,871 --> 02:03:38,690
and now they're everywhere. So all these,
uh, Hamachi grade, like Sushi grade,

2099
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:43,400
yellow tails are swimming around all
over the place and they're breeding,

2100
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:46,190
they getting bigger. Yes. It's
crazy. It's interesting. But,

2101
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:47,870
but I was thinking when they
were telling me that, well,

2102
02:03:47,871 --> 02:03:49,490
so if that's what they did,

2103
02:03:49,491 --> 02:03:51,710
like maybe they should do that
and just keep releasing him.

2104
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:56,890
Maybe we should be a program that all
the people who buy Sushi Fund into that

2105
02:03:57,651 --> 02:04:02,630
just takes a little piece of the Sushi
money and uses it to develop these

2106
02:04:02,631 --> 02:04:06,230
programs to make sure that these fucking
fish keep reading so you can have more

2107
02:04:06,231 --> 02:04:11,000
Sushi. I think people would pay extra
for that shit. Right. Then they lady,

2108
02:04:11,001 --> 02:04:14,120
then they would feel good helping out.
Yeah.

2109
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:18,680
That's what I think we can leave this
next, next, next, next generation ever.

2110
02:04:18,681 --> 02:04:21,110
Real good possibility of like
making things work out better.

2111
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:24,260
I really think that like
it's totally possible.

2112
02:04:24,890 --> 02:04:27,890
I think it's possible that the world's
just going to keep bad at getting better

2113
02:04:27,891 --> 02:04:29,600
and better and there's
going to be terrible things,

2114
02:04:29,601 --> 02:04:33,080
but it's going to keep getting better
and better and then we'll be able to come

2115
02:04:33,081 --> 02:04:37,860
to some kind of time in our future worth.
Seems like things have improved.

2116
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:42,120
I agree with you. I think we're headed
towards a, a job, a new golden era,

2117
02:04:42,121 --> 02:04:46,990
new enlightenment because, and I
think a lot of times these, um,

2118
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:51,360
things that we think are negative or
are kind of indicators of that because

2119
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:52,830
these are things,

2120
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:56,490
a lot of these negative things we
talk about were happening either way,

2121
02:04:56,730 --> 02:05:00,960
but now we're more aware of them and
people fight them and people, um,

2122
02:05:01,110 --> 02:05:04,800
are more upset about them and they're
more public because of things with social,

2123
02:05:04,801 --> 02:05:07,230
like social media.
And I think that's a positive,

2124
02:05:07,231 --> 02:05:11,610
not a negative that people aren't able
to pull the wool over your eyes as

2125
02:05:11,611 --> 02:05:12,340
easily.

2126
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:13,173
Yeah.

2127
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:17,410
I think what's really interesting about
this time was that you got so many

2128
02:05:17,411 --> 02:05:20,770
people that are able to communicate,
um,

2129
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:25,800
whether it's yourself or Joey Diaz or Ari
Shaffir or Mark Marin or whoever these

2130
02:05:27,101 --> 02:05:28,750
people are that have these podcasts.

2131
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:32,050
So many people have this
ability to communicate.

2132
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:36,730
So many people have this ability
to, you know, you show the life,

2133
02:05:36,731 --> 02:05:39,010
you let you show your world
and like a different way.

2134
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:44,230
And everybody gets to compare all
these different ways that people are

2135
02:05:44,231 --> 02:05:45,130
communicating.

2136
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:50,160
And we could kind of like come to maybe
a better understanding of why we think

2137
02:05:50,351 --> 02:05:53,050
the way we think and which I think,

2138
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:57,400
especially one of the reasons why
I'm so hell bent on having people be

2139
02:05:57,401 --> 02:06:00,430
reasonable and tried to talk to each
other so that I think that everybody could

2140
02:06:00,431 --> 02:06:03,370
learn something from
each other in this world,

2141
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:07,180
whether you're left or right or in
the center or religious or atheist or

2142
02:06:07,190 --> 02:06:10,420
whatever, there's too many, too
much conflict. It's unnecessary.

2143
02:06:10,630 --> 02:06:13,330
There's too much of what people are,
aren't, that has nothing to do with you.

2144
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:17,410
And you should be able to
talk about politics or even
religion and be completely

2145
02:06:17,411 --> 02:06:21,310
calm about it and not be angry and
not get emotional and child life.

2146
02:06:21,311 --> 02:06:23,320
But we're programmed to
think you're supposed to.

2147
02:06:23,530 --> 02:06:26,590
We're programmed to think that every
fucking conversation about something you

2148
02:06:26,591 --> 02:06:30,830
disagree with is supposed
to be this angry battle of,

2149
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:35,320
of oneupsmanship. And I don't think
it has to be, I don't think it does.

2150
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:38,280
No. I mean, um,

2151
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:41,350
there's certain issues that
like where you're like, oh,

2152
02:06:41,351 --> 02:06:43,420
I don't want to argue over my,

2153
02:06:43,421 --> 02:06:47,260
like civil rights or things like
that. You know, you're like, yeah,

2154
02:06:47,470 --> 02:06:50,030
I don't want to be like,
oh, okay, well you, you do,

2155
02:06:50,090 --> 02:06:54,050
you don't think I'm a full person.
Okay, let's have a point. Counterpoint.

2156
02:06:54,100 --> 02:06:55,330
There's issues like that.

2157
02:06:55,540 --> 02:07:00,540
But I think now so many things get wrapped
up in politics that people do forget

2158
02:07:01,271 --> 02:07:06,271
to be civilized and do forget that we've
always disagreed and we've always had

2159
02:07:06,521 --> 02:07:10,030
different sides and that's what
made us a country, you know,

2160
02:07:10,031 --> 02:07:12,670
as the fact that we were the take the,
like you said,

2161
02:07:12,671 --> 02:07:17,500
the mix of those conversations and
that's the way that we kind of head in.

2162
02:07:17,550 --> 02:07:18,290
Yeah.

2163
02:07:18,290 --> 02:07:21,900
So where we find out who we really
are as opposed to who our side is,

2164
02:07:21,901 --> 02:07:25,540
painting the other side as
you know. And I feel like, um,

2165
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:30,920
what I meant by people like being able
to get along is you can have opposing

2166
02:07:31,171 --> 02:07:35,130
thoughts and still be a nice person.
I want,

2167
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:38,350
if you're like a really
super conservative person,

2168
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,960
like sometimes I want to know why.

2169
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:44,590
Like I don't want to oppose you
as much as I want to know why.

2170
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:46,960
I want to know what you're
thinking. Like, what, what is,

2171
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:48,730
what's pushing you in this direction?

2172
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:53,080
What makes you think this as opposed to
if you are really progressive person,

2173
02:07:53,190 --> 02:07:54,760
what makes you think this?

2174
02:07:54,970 --> 02:07:59,970
Like what's going on like that that
conversation can be had in a way more

2175
02:08:00,341 --> 02:08:01,570
peaceful way?
Well,

2176
02:08:01,571 --> 02:08:05,290
maybe we could all examine why we
think about things a certain way.

2177
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:08,710
And I've been thinking about a lot when
it comes to religions lately. This,

2178
02:08:08,740 --> 02:08:13,630
we're so fucking tense about religions,
so fucking tense lately.

2179
02:08:13,631 --> 02:08:16,840
And if it's not for like kids getting
abused or wars getting started over it,

2180
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:22,120
the vast majority of it is just a
guideline for people to live their life.

2181
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:25,210
And if you take that away from them or
tell them, then that's bad for them.

2182
02:08:25,211 --> 02:08:29,170
I tell them they can't live that way
then then you've created this conflict

2183
02:08:29,171 --> 02:08:32,020
that's really not your business.
Right. And a lot of ways, yeah,

2184
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:35,800
I didn't think like that before.
I used to think before that, like,

2185
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:38,920
that's not what I believe.
So you know, these people,

2186
02:08:38,921 --> 02:08:40,970
there must be something wrong
with the way they're thinking.

2187
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:45,190
Mm. Well, that's a lot
of times that's what, um,

2188
02:08:45,290 --> 02:08:49,610
certain organized religions painted
as, right? Like if you aren't believe,

2189
02:08:49,611 --> 02:08:50,600
if you don't believe in that,

2190
02:08:50,601 --> 02:08:55,070
even you can have same
branch of Christianity or
whatever, but it's like, Oh,

2191
02:08:55,071 --> 02:08:56,920
if you're not Protestant,
sure you know this,

2192
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:59,180
then you're not falling it completely.
Or,

2193
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:04,620
and to me it was always so many of
these rules ended up just being like,

2194
02:09:05,151 --> 02:09:10,070
hey, be a nice person. Yeah, don't, don't
be a jerk. Don't murder people that,

2195
02:09:10,071 --> 02:09:11,930
you know, in there,
those are kind of costs.

2196
02:09:11,931 --> 02:09:13,610
And through all of those
things where you're like,

2197
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:16,100
that's something I can take from you,

2198
02:09:16,101 --> 02:09:19,790
but to judge someone else's
life based off of their,

2199
02:09:19,791 --> 02:09:23,210
their sexual orientation or
something, a, of anything that,

2200
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:27,170
that to me never dies, you
know? Right. So I'm always like,

2201
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:29,480
I'm open to whatever you want,

2202
02:09:29,481 --> 02:09:33,460
whatever makes you not be a fucking jerk.
I'm four.

2203
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:36,170
Yeah, no, I'm with you 100%.

2204
02:09:37,070 --> 02:09:41,190
I remember the first time I found out
there was other religions, like I want to,

2205
02:09:41,210 --> 02:09:44,090
I was raised a Catholic when I was a
little kid and I've found out there was

2206
02:09:44,091 --> 02:09:46,790
other things other than being a Catholic.
And I was like,

2207
02:09:46,791 --> 02:09:50,290
what are you talking about? So if
there's other things, cause uh,

2208
02:09:50,330 --> 02:09:54,400
my uncle was converting to Judaism and
so I was like, what does that mean? Oh,

2209
02:09:54,410 --> 02:09:56,150
he's going to become Jewish.
Like what does that mean?

2210
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:59,330
Like what are you talking
about? I was like, you know,
five or something like that.

2211
02:09:59,331 --> 02:10:02,000
I was like, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. You can shit.

2212
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:05,030
There's different ones. Like what
do they think? Like who's right.

2213
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:07,220
I remember being like six years old going,
shit,

2214
02:10:07,940 --> 02:10:11,630
there's more than one story that you have
to follow. We're not sure who's right.

2215
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:14,330
And my uncle is going to
switch over to the other story.

2216
02:10:14,870 --> 02:10:16,910
Now he believes a different story.
I can't believe this.

2217
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,480
He's got an adjusted story and you know,
you fall into this pattern,

2218
02:10:20,510 --> 02:10:23,420
now you're in this, this story's
pattern. Like, wow. You know,

2219
02:10:23,570 --> 02:10:27,950
we lost him to the Marvel Universe,
DC comics for so long.

2220
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:31,010
He was all about Batman and Superman
and now he's like, fuck them.

2221
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:32,210
I'm with the Avengers.

2222
02:10:35,330 --> 02:10:37,400
Crazy as a phone way look at it.

2223
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:40,100
It's an interesting way of looking at
it without being disrespectful to either

2224
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:43,790
side. It's like, wow, okay. You
know, I don't know who's right.

2225
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:47,750
We know who makes better
movies. Yes. Yeah.

2226
02:10:47,751 --> 02:10:51,140
The choose do an excellent
job making movies.

2227
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:56,060
It's amazing how much they've been
involved in show business. You know,

2228
02:10:56,061 --> 02:10:59,930
when I'm watching that marvelous Mrs
Maizel then make sure a realize like,

2229
02:10:59,931 --> 02:11:02,990
oh yeah, Lenny Bruce is Jewish. This
guy was Jewish doc. I was Jewish.

2230
02:11:03,310 --> 02:11:07,170
There were so many Jewish guys in
the early days of stand up. Yeah.

2231
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:09,770
Got a little mafia, you
know, the same time,

2232
02:11:09,771 --> 02:11:11,600
there was a lot of Jewish
boxers back then too.

2233
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,600
So thing that people
probably don't know it was,

2234
02:11:14,601 --> 02:11:18,990
they were a underclass and a lot
of ways or you know, um, and like,

2235
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:22,280
that's like now it's Russians.
Like you get a lot of Russian boxers now.

2236
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:26,670
[inaudible] ass, motherfucking Russians.
Tude hard men, hard man, because they're,

2237
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:30,320
they're coming over here from a hard
place and they're fucking people up,

2238
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:33,970
you know? And it's like one day
it'll be someone else. It's, it's,

2239
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:37,130
it's interesting how it goes
in these waves, you know? Yeah.

2240
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:39,560
But whatever country is not doing well.
Yeah.

2241
02:11:39,561 --> 02:11:42,980
And it's interesting when you see the
waves of standups come out of these

2242
02:11:42,981 --> 02:11:44,300
countries too, you know, like,

2243
02:11:44,750 --> 02:11:48,440
like there's different styles of standup
now in different parts of the world.

2244
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:52,280
You know, standup is really a
global thing now. Like legitimate,

2245
02:11:52,281 --> 02:11:55,950
like an English guys have their own style.
You know, there's a lot of those guys,

2246
02:11:55,951 --> 02:11:59,240
like, I've never been to Edinburgh,
but, um, Ari Shaffir goes all the time.

2247
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:03,740
He's like, dude, they have like, oh,
they'll do these hours on just a subject.

2248
02:12:04,710 --> 02:12:09,500
All the themes. Yeah, exactly. Different
Vibe, different style, a lot less.

2249
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:13,730
Um,
rowdy Lollis I'm boisterous.

2250
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:17,870
Just people listening. They're
great at listening. Uh, we did, um,

2251
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:21,770
uh, Sweden and, uh, we,
we played Stockholm,

2252
02:12:21,771 --> 02:12:24,350
me and Tony Hinchcliffe and Tony
was like, dude, it's just like,

2253
02:12:24,351 --> 02:12:26,210
they didn't like me. I going
to know. They're just polite.

2254
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:29,990
I go in between the jokes. They're
just quiet. They're listening,

2255
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,900
you're not used to that. And
he's like, okay, okay. Okay.

2256
02:12:32,901 --> 02:12:35,030
And he went out the second one, he
was like, you're right, you're right.

2257
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:38,830
They just so nice that something
was wrong. But it's, it's,

2258
02:12:38,900 --> 02:12:42,080
I'll put it in for your timing cause it
makes me to have to have more material

2259
02:12:42,081 --> 02:12:47,081
because you're used to like
waiting for a few seconds am great.

2260
02:12:49,570 --> 02:12:53,000
Well it's also, you know,
that's, it's, it's not,

2261
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:55,580
I don't think it's that
common art form over there.

2262
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:59,840
I don't think they have a long history
of having standup in Sweden do that.

2263
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:02,900
Not that I'm aware of. I mean,
maybe they do and we don't know.

2264
02:13:02,901 --> 02:13:03,930
But for whatever it is,
it's,

2265
02:13:04,130 --> 02:13:08,510
it's diminutive in comparison to
any of the places that we know.

2266
02:13:08,511 --> 02:13:11,040
If they'd have scenes, whether
it's New York scene, you know,

2267
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:15,440
La has seen San Francisco, there's like
some big scenes here where, you know,

2268
02:13:15,441 --> 02:13:18,410
funny guys who,
and girls who've come out of these scenes,

2269
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:22,520
you don't hear like a lot of
guys from Sweden, do you know?

2270
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:25,850
Yeah. But they're starting to get more
of them. There's getting more of them.

2271
02:13:25,851 --> 02:13:29,180
Everybody all around the world, they
started getting more comedy. It's really,

2272
02:13:29,181 --> 02:13:32,080
it's an interesting time and that way
it's very similar to Jujitsu. You know,

2273
02:13:32,081 --> 02:13:35,070
Jujitsu at one point in time there's
only a few places you get it outside of

2274
02:13:35,071 --> 02:13:38,190
Brazil. It was hard to find someone who's
really good at teaching it and now it's

2275
02:13:38,191 --> 02:13:43,020
everywhere. I was in New
Zealand and Australia, it's
an Africa, it's everywhere.

2276
02:13:43,290 --> 02:13:47,580
There's Jujitsu, old Canada and fucking
the Puerto Rico is Jujitsu everywhere.

2277
02:13:47,790 --> 02:13:52,670
All over the world. Cuba, everyone
has Jujitsu, you know, just spread it.

2278
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:55,470
Found out it was awesome.
That could be the same with Stan

2279
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:59,320
then in forms back into the practice,
right,

2280
02:13:59,321 --> 02:14:01,530
because there's
everybody's doing new style

2281
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:03,870
hundred percent and everyone is like,

2282
02:14:03,871 --> 02:14:08,340
there's a really accelerated learning
growth from the time where it starts

2283
02:14:08,341 --> 02:14:09,240
getting put on the Internet,

2284
02:14:09,241 --> 02:14:13,500
which is like around like 95 96 and the
Internet kind of becomes alive from that

2285
02:14:13,501 --> 02:14:14,191
point on.

2286
02:14:14,191 --> 02:14:18,920
People comparing Jujitsu techniques
and watching matches and then you know,

2287
02:14:19,110 --> 02:14:23,490
new gyms opening up all around America
in particular. It's like the whole level,

2288
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:25,380
the sport went through the roof.
It's crazy.

2289
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:29,900
Yeah. I think, yeah, I think that's very
similar to comedy because I think a lot,

2290
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:30,420
um,

2291
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:35,280
my personal growth was I was able to do
it because I was able to watch so much

2292
02:14:35,281 --> 02:14:40,200
comedy and also I was able to get on the
Internet and read about a lot of comedy

2293
02:14:40,201 --> 02:14:45,201
and in Twitter and Youtube or Twitter was
just starting in Youtube was going and

2294
02:14:45,241 --> 02:14:47,640
I watch a lot of them
watching the videos with you,

2295
02:14:47,641 --> 02:14:52,320
would you invincea those things, you
know, and a lot of that stuff, um,

2296
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:55,620
informed my comedy at an early,

2297
02:14:55,690 --> 02:15:00,630
early age about like making a style or
just how I wanted to write for myself.

2298
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:02,430
Because when you're,
especially when you're first starting,

2299
02:15:02,790 --> 02:15:04,830
a lot of what will work
when you're first starting,

2300
02:15:04,831 --> 02:15:09,660
we'll set you up for failure later as far
as like pandering to people are riding

2301
02:15:09,661 --> 02:15:13,250
for these rowdy rooms. There
were bar rooms, you know, and,

2302
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:15,660
and those things don't
work when you go to travel.

2303
02:15:15,810 --> 02:15:20,700
And so if I didn't have like the internet
or they always have these things too

2304
02:15:20,701 --> 02:15:24,510
wise to go like, oh, don't
worry about this time.

2305
02:15:24,511 --> 02:15:28,830
Don't worry about this local scene as
much because you don't want to be a local

2306
02:15:28,831 --> 02:15:32,910
act, you know? And that was,
that was very helpful for me. And

2307
02:15:35,310 --> 02:15:36,143
that's it.

2308
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:39,910
Yeah. No for me too, man. I know exactly
what you're saying. Yeah. Well listen man,

2309
02:15:39,970 --> 02:15:42,060
let's wrap this bitch up.
Thank you for doing this.

2310
02:15:42,340 --> 02:15:45,280
Tell people where can they see
your special? Oh, they can get it.

2311
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:49,750
It's called giggle fit. It's available
on Itunes, comedy central on demand.

2312
02:15:49,751 --> 02:15:54,610
Amazon, your x box, your playstation
anywhere really beautiful.

2313
02:15:55,780 --> 02:16:00,640
And your Twitter handle is at Ron Funches.
I have my podcasts getting better.

2314
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:05,800
Instagram, Instagram, Ron Funche, ladies
and gentlemen. Ron Funches. Thank you,

2315
02:16:05,801 --> 02:16:08,830
sir. Appreciate your band. It
was fun. Appreciate you Joe. Bye.

2316
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:15,263
Okay.

2317
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:21,540
Hmm.
