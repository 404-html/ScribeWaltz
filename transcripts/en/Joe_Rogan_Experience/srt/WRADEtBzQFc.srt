00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello Freak bitches when all that shit
went down with Chris Kyle in the car and

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,240
when he said that he punched you in a
bar and get you sued the family like,

3
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:13,074
no,
I didn't.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,030
Well,
I didn't choose.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,600
The family sued him rather.
Excuse me.

6
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:20,601
I shooed him and he died and then the
shoot automatically goes to his estate.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,410
That's the way the legal works.
She was never in any jeopardy because in

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:29,760
any writers contract you have insurance
from the publisher,

9
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:33,390
so it's me.
They portrayed and I became the villain

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,300
going after the widow and the kids.
Exactly.

11
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:39,570
That's the biggest lie.
It was a big insurance company that's

12
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:43,470
covering the whole thing.
They're not out a panty and they won't

13
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:45,870
be out a panel.
You had to explain that I'm sure over

14
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:46,390
and over.
No,

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,200
I couldn't explain it,
but the tie,

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,540
the trial got overturned because the
insurance came out,

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,710
so it's okay to lie in court,
but if the truth comes out,

18
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:56,760
you can get a new trial.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,710
The insurance came out.
What does that mean in court?

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,010
You're not allowed to say that insurance
is paying for everything,

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,030
even though it's the truth.
You're not allowed to say that in court.

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,800
So what happens when you say it in
court?

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,990
Well,
it came out and the judge allowed it to

24
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:13,530
eliminate it degree and then the appeals
court ruled that the judge shouldn't

25
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:18,090
have did that
because having the judge say that it

26
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,870
sways people.
So they think that a fine tool against

27
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:24,260
the insurance companies because
insurance companies a big,

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,070
even though the other side is doing
what's called poor mouth thing,

29
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,840
they're getting up and saying it's
taxing them financially and lying

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,440
insurance is paying for all of it.
Don't get up and lie about it.

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,630
So the other side was saying this is
going to devastate our family reality.

32
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:43,720
Oh yeah.
Trying to influence the.

33
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,130
And in this case,
let me state this.

34
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,940
How overwhelming must be evidence of Ben
for the jury to go against the grieving

35
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:58,440
widow of the dead war veteran.
Yeah.

36
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:02,100
It must be pretty overwhelming.
Evidence was overwhelming.

37
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:02,530
The,
the,

38
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,370
the jury went from.
They came for me.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,180
They said he was lied.
This didn't happen and we're awarding.

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,650
Well,
why do you think he did that?

41
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,420
Did you know him?
No.

42
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,890
You didn't know him?
No,

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,490
I mean I didn't know even how he was.
Thing happened.

44
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,600
We were there on the same nights we were
at [inaudible] because I was there for a

45
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:26,220
graduation of class 2:58 AM,
class 58.

46
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,980
It's traditionally every hundred
classes.

47
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,860
If you can you come back to the
graduation.

48
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,130
So class 2:58 was graduating the next
day on Friday I came out along with my

49
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:43,191
teammates from class 58 to attend that
graduation the next day.

50
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,000
So why would I say bad things about the
seals if I'm there?

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,050
That's what he said he punched me for
will tell because people don't know what

52
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:54,840
we're talking about because probably a
lot of people listening to this have no

53
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,840
idea what we're talking about.
So let me just fill my real quick.

54
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,840
All right.
The,

55
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:02,841
the book American sniper.
The movie with Bradley Cooper was just

56
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,460
giant hit movie,
very patriotic movie about a guy who was

57
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:08,740
one of the most successful snipers in US
history.

58
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:11,800
Right?
A very successful warrior,

59
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,110
navy seal,
war hero.

60
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,290
Everybody loved him.
Then he goes on the opiod,

61
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:21,040
Anthony Show and he says that he punched
you out.

62
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,240
You know there's a chapter in his book.
Yes.

63
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,200
Where he writes that he called me scruff
face.

64
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,900
Yeah.
And you said that I said scheels

65
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,790
deserved to die.
That in other words,

66
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,790
she accused me of treason.
Yes.

67
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,210
And I was out there for a seal
graduation.

68
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,400
If I felt that way about my old unit,
why would I be attending?

69
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,490
So he wrote in the book,
He gave you a nickname in the book,

70
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,300
scruff,
face,

71
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,320
whoever.
I mean he might not have.

72
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:49,870
Even when he wrote it in the book,
he might not have even thought that he

73
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,280
was going to give that to you.
I mean,

74
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:54,760
who knows what was going on.
My thought was at the time I was trying

75
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,590
to wrap my head around why anybody would
do this.

76
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,570
Um,
and I was thinking,

77
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,830
well maybe he's just trying to generate
as much controversy as possible to

78
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,290
generate as much income as possible from
his book.

79
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,360
And it just got out of hand.
I don't,

80
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,890
I mean,
I'm sure I was trying to put it together

81
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,720
because there was a couple of other
fabrications,

82
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:11,740
right?
There was a,

83
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,650
um,
a shooting at a gas station that never

84
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:15,484
took place.

85
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,940
And he said that he,
during Katrina he was on the people who

86
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:21,040
were looting.
Yeah.

87
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,960
That was disturbing because that's
murder.

88
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,110
Yeah.
And he also lied about his medals.

89
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,970
The navy had to come out and.
Correct.

90
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:31,360
He said he had two silver stars and five
bronze stars.

91
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,440
He had won silver star and three bronze
stars.

92
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,580
So he lied about three medals.
Well,

93
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,430
that's a good one.
In three is impressive enough.

94
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,680
Exactly.
Exactly.

95
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,230
And then they try to give them an excuse
saying,

96
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,610
well,
he was confused.

97
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:46,444
No,
you're not.

98
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,560
When you get a medal like that,
it's like graduating from college.

99
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:55,420
They give you a certificate that puts on
your wall if you win the bronze star,

100
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,250
the silver star,
but as a,

101
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,600
as an seal yourself.
And he threw me under the bus.

102
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,080
What does that feel like to you?
But this is obviously,

103
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,530
this is something that's very near and
dear to your heart who hugely.

104
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,160
He has made it to where I can't go to a
reunion anymore.

105
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,520
There were 170 seals that wanted me
kicked out of the Udt Seal Association

106
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,820
over his lie
and the lives of his buddies who came up

107
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,220
and tried to testify for them so it got
embarrassing.

108
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,860
His trial said that it actually
happened.

109
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,090
No,
they couldn't say it,

110
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:35,050
but they tried to say everything else to
make it seem like it did well.

111
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:37,570
How the hell they do that?
Well because they danced around the

112
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,780
questions and the lawyer rang and well,
you have to piece together.

113
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,490
There wasn't one witness that saw me get
hit and there wasn't one witness that

114
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:49,270
heard me say anything.
See attributed to me and weren't you

115
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,530
visible the next day?
No photographs that night.

116
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,720
Them posing for pictures with.
If I had said all this stuff,

117
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,030
why would they have take pictures with
me?

118
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,270
What is that feeling like when someone
just fucking lies horrible and when it

119
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:09,320
makes about a terrible,
terrible,

120
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:13,760
and what's worse about it is the media
jumps on it and convicts me of it

121
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:17,420
because why they broke the story when I
went off the grid,

122
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,670
Mexico where I couldn't even come back.

123
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,090
So they broke the story.
Do you think they knew?

124
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm starting to believe that,
but why didn't it happen on the opiod

125
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,150
Anthony Show?
Yeah,

126
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,690
but that don't think that was planned
because I know those guys.

127
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,180
They are,
but that was the whole ball.

128
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:38,120
They all show did it.
He did it that day on O'reilly later

129
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,440
that afternoon.
So he wants.

130
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,480
He named you.
He just start naming you ever.

131
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,550
Oh yeah.
Then it went viral.

132
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,020
It went viral and everyone convicted me
because they said,

133
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:51,140
well,
this Iraq war veteran wouldn't lie.

134
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,010
Really?
I just watched a.

135
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,610
well,
let me tell you all that.

136
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,680
It's destroyed my life.
I can't get hired for a job during my

137
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,110
trial.
After it was over,

138
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,040
guess what happened?
Thirty four major media conglomerates

139
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,120
entered the,
the,

140
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,983
the,
uh,

141
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,050
the trial with that Ama.
Ama.

142
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,550
See,
they call it or whatever have of

143
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,530
influencing the court of appeals to
overturn my verdict and they did it.

144
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,310
Thirty four media conglomerates,
the New York Times,

145
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,200
The Washington Post.
All of these media conglomerates appeal

146
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,840
to the Court of Appeals to overturn my
verdict,

147
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,190
but why?
Because I won on something called unjust

148
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,430
enrichment.
They want the ability to be able to

149
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:40,700
defame you and profit from it.
In other words,

150
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:44,120
I'll put it what they had,
what these judges accommodated them with

151
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,860
a,
there's going to be another trial.

152
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:47,590
They've ordered a new trial.
Okay,

153
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,160
so I got to go through it again,
but I'm glad because when it comes out

154
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:57,161
to juries and judges find kyle guilty
who's not going to believe it then and.

155
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:02,840
But the point is they.
They've ordered a new trial.

156
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,130
They've,
they dis.

157
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,980
They throughout the whole verdict of the
jury,

158
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,600
the federal judge who wrote substantial
evidence supporting the jury's verdict.

159
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,380
They did all that and they violated
their own rules.

160
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,020
A 76 year rule.
Here's what it states if,

161
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,680
because it happened during summation,
where the judge allowed it in the.

162
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,820
My attorney it,
it ended up for questions in an 11 day

163
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:32,900
trial and a half,
a page of a 20 page summary and it was

164
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:37,901
overturned on that and they overturned
it because they felt that it was undue

165
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:42,230
influence on the jury that they found
out that insurance was paying for

166
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,590
everything,
so was one factor.

167
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,920
Well,
and here's the deal.

168
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,850
If the rules state that if in final
argument they say something,

169
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:56,190
you must object,
you must object.

170
00:08:56,191 --> 00:09:01,191
So the trial lawyer as a chance to rule
during final argument and the jury has a

171
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:04,140
chance to hear the ruling,
they never objected,

172
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:09,141
so they must object to undue influence
because of the fact that it was never

173
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,250
wait.
They never objected.

174
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,720
The jury was dismissed at 1158 at 12.
Oh,

175
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,330
Tuesday.
Then objected.

176
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,280
The judge overruled them and we were
done with it.

177
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,620
Well,
these two judges,

178
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:27,621
Riley and shepherd have now overturned
the case on something that was never

179
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:29,460
objected to in trial.

180
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,660
They objected to it,
so they overturned the jury and the

181
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:37,500
federal judge them.
They also overturned my unjust

182
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,770
enrichment claim because the media
didn't want it.

183
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,100
What they've allowed now is the media
can defame you and profit from it and

184
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:51,690
you can't get any of their profits and
no matter how they harm you,

185
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,910
while that's the equivalent of if you
went out and robbed the bank and they

186
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:00,840
caught you and they shouldn't and shoot
a two years in prison for the bank

187
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:02,430
robbery,
but when you get out,

188
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:07,431
you get to keep all the money you took,
so that's in this particular case,

189
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,430
this particular which will now be the
standard they ruled that way,

190
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,640
they now make it to where you can profit
from wrongdoing because of this case.

191
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,730
This is such a touchy case because it's
so indicative of the complications of

192
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:28,550
people because people are not simple.
It's really varied.

193
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:30,250
Archie,
he lied.

194
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,120
He did lie,
but any harm to be with his lie that,

195
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:37,690
but that's not what I'm saying.
What's complicated is he's also the

196
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:42,691
subject of this gigantic movie and this
symbol of patriotism where so many

197
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:45,370
people will say,
Chris Kyle,

198
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:47,690
rest in peace.
So many people would have.

199
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,190
I saw a cloud that was.
Someone took a photo in the cloud and

200
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:53,980
that's on a cloud.
That's Chris.

201
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,680
Chris Kyle.
It looked like a sniper in the car in.

202
00:10:56,681 --> 00:11:00,490
This is Chris Kyle guiding,
guarding the skies.

203
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,510
Like it became a meme.
I mean he became this thing where he

204
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,540
was.
He was a representative of the brave

205
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,490
military,
like the portrayal,

206
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,730
but honestly the betrayal that Bradley
Cooper played in that movie,

207
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:17,070
that movie was so simplistic and so it
was.

208
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,030
It was like right out of the Joseph
Campbell Hero's journey.

209
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,050
Had I not gone to court,
that would have been in the movie.

210
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,420
Really?
I had to stop it.

211
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,640
They were going to have him punch you in
the movie,

212
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,430
the book.
Holy Shit.

213
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:36,290
And I had to stop it.
I know when we were.

214
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,950
When we were in trial,
you know what they tried to do to

215
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:43,690
diminish my role because when they knew
they were gonna lose their lawyer got me

216
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,940
on the stand and he said,
Mr Ventura.

217
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,960
He said,
would it surprise you to know that the

218
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:54,880
first draft of the doesn't have you in
it?

219
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,640
Trying to prove how insignificant my
first draft of the movie.

220
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:01,560
That doesn't mean shit.
Well,

221
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,240
the first draft of this.
Yeah,

222
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,460
but so what if the second draft as you
it though?

223
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,630
I said,
here's where my response.

224
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,770
I said,
no,

225
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:13,450
that wouldn't surprise me at all because
I said we've sent two letters to warner

226
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:17,380
brothers warning them that if I am
indeed in in this movie,

227
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:19,150
they will be next to be sued.

228
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,720
So we put Warner Brothers on notice that
if this is included in your movie,

229
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,020
you will get sued next and you know
people out here,

230
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:33,580
they don't want to step into a lawsuit.
That's the only thing that kept me from

231
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:38,170
being punched out in that movie and
portrayed me as a villain in that

232
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:41,260
frickin movie.
I'd never seen them fill in way more

233
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,070
than a villain.
Yeah,

234
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,780
right.
I mean that is insane.

235
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,400
It is insane.
Because what's.

236
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,820
What's crazy to me and what's
complicated about this is that there are

237
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:53,500
thousands and thousands of brave men and
women who have risked their lives,

238
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:58,501
sacrificed their lives,
and this guy becomes this this way,

239
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,610
and when he rises above,
including me,

240
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,870
including you.
Yes,

241
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,830
very important,
but he rises above all this and becomes

242
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,870
this icon figure.
Yes.

243
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,890
This iconic figure that you can't
tarnish and then the truth is irrelevant

244
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:19,300
and they're willing to sacrifice people
like you and the truth just for this

245
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,580
overall image of patriotism.

246
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,740
Yup.
It's crazy.

247
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,920
What a crazy place that must've been for
you still is.

248
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,360
In fact,
do you know that this person that I told

249
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,950
you about,
what the seizures,

250
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,090
that she's your disorder started right
after this.

251
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,450
I'm sure that the doctors have said
she's yours can be caused by stress.

252
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,710
So I hold Chris Kyle directly
responsible for the seizure disorder.

253
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,720
All showed that I had to face that
marijuana cured.

254
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,760
Did you ever communicate with him face
to face?

255
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,770
Only one shot the first,
uh,

256
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:59,140
when we first and June,
I didn't even know who he was.

257
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,820
And then in June of 2012,
after the book came out in January,

258
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,940
uh,
we had a settlement conference where he

259
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:10,210
kept saying that if he met me in person,
we could work it out,

260
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,590
show at this conference.
We agreed I would meet him in a room,

261
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,240
the judge in the corner and just ski.

262
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,740
And I,
like you and I are here.

263
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,060
We sat down in the room and I looked him
right in the face and I said,

264
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,670
why did you do this?
You never punched me.

265
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,830
He looked me back and said,
yes I did.

266
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,780
I turned to the judge.
I said,

267
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,020
there's no need to go any farther.
I said,

268
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:36,220
if he's not going to admit it,
didn't happen face to face one on one.

269
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,790
And I challenged his courage because
yeah,

270
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,690
he had the courage to go to Iraq.
He had the courage to shoot all these

271
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:46,240
people,
but he didn't have the courage to tell

272
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:47,230
the truth.
Daddy,

273
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,350
what a bizarre moment that must have
been sitting across from that guy.

274
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,120
And he looked at me and said,
yes,

275
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:55,100
I did.
What was the look in his face?

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,920
I believe,
and I'm not a doctor,

277
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:01,040
but I've done some studying,
I think he was a sociopath.

278
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,650
Sociopath can lie and hold a straight
face and they lie to the point where

279
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:11,651
they believe their own lie.
How bizarre is it that this iconic

280
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:15,170
figure and then look how he died.
Yeah.

281
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,440
Well,
he had no training and post traumatic

282
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:21,770
stress.
He's not medical and yet he's taking

283
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:26,771
this marine to a gun range.
Who suffering from posttraumatic stress

284
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,380
wouldn't common sense tell you not to
put a weapon in the hands of someone

285
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,660
suffering from posttraumatic stress.

286
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,670
Stress is different,
or what do they tell him to man up?

287
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,970
Why would you put a weapon in somebody's
hands who suffering from posttraumatic

288
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,940
stress when you have no medical
training?

289
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,880
House,
quiet,

290
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,690
qualified to treat this guy?
Well,

291
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,410
I would assume it would be based on his
own posttraumatic stress,

292
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,840
but he didn't have it.
He didn't have it at all.

293
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,120
No.
He was never treated for it.

294
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,230
He may have had it.
Maybe that's why he did what he did.

295
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,960
I don't know.
God,

296
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,470
what a crazy place today,
but,

297
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,900
but the.
For me,

298
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,630
it's like I've been accused of something
I didn't do.

299
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:18,800
I don't even know the guy never.
I may have met him that night briefly.

300
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,950
I obviously didn't get one.
One millionth of a percent of the amount

301
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:26,240
of hate that you did,

302
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,820
but just read.
I got read off for September 11th of

303
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:35,690
this year.
I was in New York doing this book tour

304
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:38,720
and I got read off in a hotel lobby over
this.

305
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,980
What does that mean?
Read off?

306
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,580
A guy yelled and screamed at me in front
of the entire hotel lobby,

307
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,810
Jesus Christ.
That's what I live with now and I

308
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:52,250
haven't been damaged.
My reputation isn't damaged over

309
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:53,750
something I never did.

310
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,580
When I was going to say is,
I obviously haven't experienced one,

311
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:00,490
1000000th of the hate that you have,
but I read.

312
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,910
We read this article on the air.
We were trying to figure out what

313
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:08,170
happened when your case was going on,
and so we read this article that was,

314
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,200
I don't know,
it was in the New York Times.

315
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,320
See if he could find the article
detailing all the various lies.

316
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,940
Oh,
that's an Yorker magazine.

317
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:19,640
New Yorker Yorker,
they did an investigation of him but it

318
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:24,310
stunning and just reading that the
fucking amount of hate tweets and

319
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:27,850
facebook tweets and you fucking coward
and you this.

320
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:28,684
He knew that.
I'm like,

321
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,070
Hey,
I didn't write it.

322
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,050
Okay.
I'm just trying to figure out what the

323
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,510
fuck is going on.
And if someone put something like that

324
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,240
in the New Yorker with verified claims,
I mean,

325
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:39,610
everything's verified.
What they were saying that he said and

326
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:41,920
what actually had happened.
It was all verified.

327
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,970
It's very,
very,

328
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:47,170
very confusing that somehow or another
this slipped through the cracks and that

329
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,940
this became their iconic figure.
Again,

330
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,470
not discounting along with you.
The thousands and thousands of patriotic

331
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,220
Americans that risked their lives.

332
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,380
And he is too.
Nobody's denying.

333
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,640
He wasn't a great sniper.
Nobody's denying he didn't do his job.

334
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,120
I've never denied that from him or said
that about him.

335
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,190
He,
he may be the best.

336
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:11,830
I don't know.
I'll still put my money on Carlos half

337
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,600
cocteau the marine as being the best
sniper I want especially now.

338
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,800
But uh,
but uh,

339
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,200
he,
he did his job and he did it well.

340
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:22,810
But why did he have to take an old
veteran?

341
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,920
That would be like me taking a world war
two guy and throwing him under the bus.

342
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,710
Why the fuck would he choose you?
Because I had fame.

343
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,590
He.
I think he got jealous that night.

344
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:35,920
We were at the bar because everyone
crowded around and wanted their picture

345
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:38,470
with me.
Wow.

346
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,730
I don't know.
He'll never be around to answer it.

347
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,350
I'd love to know why he picked out me.
I think because I'm probably the most

348
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:52,351
famous maybe or I develop to be the most
famous seal other than Dick Marcinko,

349
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:55,210
the rogue warrior.
Great books.

350
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,550
I read his books.
He's a friend of mine.

351
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:58,540
Richard Marcinko.

352
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,570
When you sat down and you're talking to
this guy,

353
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:03,610
how much time were you actually in the
room with them?

354
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,110
Oh,
a couple of minutes.

355
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,600
Was all the minute.
The minute he looked me in the eye and

356
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:09,070
said,
I sure did he hit you.

357
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,030
I turned to the judge,
said we got nothing more to talk about.

358
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,210
You didn't want it.
I offered him.

359
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,270
I shed.
If you will walk out to be with the

360
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,080
fresh and admit you fabricated this
story,

361
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,350
I will forgive you in front of the crash
and we will go on with our lives.

362
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,370
He would not do it.
He did not have the courage to stand up

363
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:34,450
and tell the truth.

364
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,860
It takes a lot of courage to admit you
lied about something that massive.

365
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,660
I mean,
this is in line about speeding,

366
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,630
right?
This is.

367
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,760
This is a massive,
massive.

368
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,860
What about ruining my life?
Ruining my reputation,

369
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:50,861
ruining my wife's life rule.
I lost my conspiracy theory show because

370
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:54,680
of it real.
I can't get hired right now.

371
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,130
I can't get a job.
My last job was on the Internet.

372
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:02,390
That aura tv because the owners Carlos
slim from Mexico.

373
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,750
From that you know who I'm hired.
Do you know who I work for now?

374
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,950
The Russians.
Russian TV are the only people that will

375
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:14,951
hire me because 34 media conglomerate
centered this case to overturn me.

376
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:17,420
You think they're going to hire me

377
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,660
now?
Explain that.

378
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,060
Why do you think they did that?
Do you think they did that?

379
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:25,080
Because if they overturn your case,
if they can somehow or another,

380
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:30,170
because they don't want a credit check,
but is that it or is that discrediting

381
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:33,030
you in like that was a gigantic hit
movie.

382
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,790
But if they decide,
if they can discredit you,

383
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,130
it makes that movie still value.

384
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,410
Not only that,
it stops me from running for president

385
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:43,180
don't,
and if they can discredit me.
