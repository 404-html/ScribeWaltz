1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,850
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:03,811
He is a wizard.

3
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:03,960
I,

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,390
I,

5
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,460
I take my hat off to them,

6
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:06,170
you know,

7
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:06,451
you know,

8
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:06,581
uh,

9
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:07,470
Angela Dundee.

10
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,520
Sure.

11
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,620
He used to come and see me in west
palm all the time and he knew that I,

12
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:11,940
you know,

13
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,480
my head,

14
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,960
I had like some history of boxing and
my family and he brought me this great

15
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,110
picture of all the Philly
fighters and I was at the,

16
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:21,870
at the dinner with him one night and
I started picking his brain a little.

17
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:22,141
I said,

18
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,460
who was the baddest motherfucker?

19
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,260
Bolam so who do you think of all the
guys that you saw or which could beat

20
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:28,741
anybody?

21
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:29,574
He goes,

22
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,600
Sonny Liston,

23
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,680
hands down.

24
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,340
Wow.

25
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,200
He said everybody was
afraid of him and he said,

26
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:34,351
you know,

27
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:34,780
he was,

28
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,081
yeah,

29
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:35,930
there's a lot of problems.

30
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,021
Whatever.

31
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:37,490
I Dunno.

32
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,100
Mob ties.

33
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,281
Yeah.

34
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:40,560
But apparently heroine and you know,

35
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
that second Ali fight
was definitely thrown.

36
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,100
Oh yeah.

37
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,401
You know,

38
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,720
or you could say it's such a joke.

39
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,500
Anyway,

40
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,580
he's faking.

41
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,030
Well,

42
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,630
he got punched like they call it a
phantom punch is not a fan of punch.

43
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:52,500
He definitely got punched,

44
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:56,820
but he was waiting for the first punch
to land so that he could just lay down.

45
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,110
Like he pulled that up.

46
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:58,471
Jimmy,

47
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,310
we go watch this.

48
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,430
It's a Muhammad Ali
versus Sonny Liston too,

49
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,211
in Lewiston,

50
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:03,840
Maine.

51
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,170
You know,

52
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,280
I thought it was going to be forming
because of his size and his strength,

53
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:08,641
but he,

54
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:08,911
you know,

55
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:09,391
he's a list.

56
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,224
It was the toughest.

57
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,401
Yeah.

58
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:11,671
Well,

59
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,091
you know what,

60
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:15,570
foreman before Ali beat him was
a different animal post Ali.

61
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,020
He was never the same guy because
that air of invincibility was gone.

62
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,610
And then he had that crazy fight.

63
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,200
I believe it was with Ron Lyle.

64
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,900
They just fucking blasted each other
in the head and knocked each other down

65
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:25,920
like four or five times.

66
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,610
You remembered it punched that he
hit a George Foreman with in Jamaica,

67
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,301
picked him up,

68
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:30,921
not your chore.

69
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:34,350
And Joe Frazier Frazier pick
them up and the stomach punch.

70
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,720
I don't remember what,

71
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,660
what he hit him with,

72
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,494
but I remember his,

73
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,510
his legs literally came up off the ground.

74
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,830
I never saw that before.

75
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,640
Yeah,

76
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,210
credible.

77
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,050
He was a monster.

78
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,630
He was such a fucking murderous puncher.

79
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,390
I was at the Spinx,

80
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:47,700
uh,

81
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,533
Tyson foot.

82
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,170
Uh,

83
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,003
Michael Spinks.

84
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,161
Yeah,

85
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:52,040
we talked about that a
couple of times on podcasts.

86
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:52,950
I'll scary.

87
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,401
He's up.

88
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,180
Jumped the devil.

89
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,900
Yeah.

90
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,051
Yeah.

91
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:56,090
That's really what we,

92
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,990
I think we talked about
it at the laugh factory.

93
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,840
I think we talked about it more
than once because it was such a,

94
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,380
I mean you were there for like one of
the most stunning moments in boxing

95
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:04,761
history.

96
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:04,831
Yeah,

97
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:05,340
it was cool.

98
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,070
A lot of people taught Michael Spinks
was going to give him a hard time cause

99
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:10,860
spanx had gone 12 rounds at
Larry Holmes and you know,

100
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:13,560
and beat Larry Holmes by
decision and you know,

101
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:15,330
and he was the light heavyweight champion.

102
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,650
He was a good boxer.

103
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,390
He just had no business.

104
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,070
He was so small too.

105
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,020
He was barely one 99,

106
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,411
you know,

107
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,610
and he's fighting Mike Tyson.

108
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:24,444
Tyson was,

109
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,620
Tyson was a much bigger,

110
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:25,920
you know,

111
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,480
in comparison to today's fighters.

112
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,200
He was probably like two
20 built better though.

113
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:34,201
It's compact and 1965 Louis domain of
watch this because Ali still looking slick

114
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,160
man.

115
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,180
There's still to this day,

116
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,620
no heavyweight that moves like him.

117
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:41,370
Man,

118
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,140
look how fucking good he moved.

119
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,970
So light on his feet for a guy who's
220 pounds or whatever the hell he was,

120
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,020
side to side,

121
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,100
all that head movement.

122
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,660
You mean you can't look at that.

123
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,560
You can't even touch him listed
with lunge forward with that Jab.

124
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,723
Good luck.

125
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,980
Now here he gets him with a punch
like right as he tries to listen,

126
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:04,930
tries to crowd them and it happens
with Ali's face to the camera.

127
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:09,250
So listens back to the camera and he
just comes with an overhand right.

128
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,500
And as soon as he catches
listed on the draw,

129
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,140
listening goes down like he got shot.

130
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,340
I think it's right here.

131
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,743
Right here.

132
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,360
Whenever it is.

133
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:22,380
It's when listens.

134
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:23,290
Backs too.

135
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,600
But look how beautiful Ali moves,

136
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:27,981
man.

137
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:28,770
It's amazing.

138
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,410
I mean he really did float
and this is the real Ali.

139
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,420
This is the Ali of 1965 you know
before the army and all that.

140
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:36,991
Yeah,

141
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:37,381
man,

142
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:38,700
the army fucked him.

143
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,730
That whole thing fucked him because for
three years from 1967 to 1970 he was

144
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:45,540
completely out of commend.

145
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,710
Shed is total prime.

146
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,723
Yeah.

147
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:48,421
Look,

148
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:48,661
watch.

149
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,800
We'll show the difference here.

150
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,710
When when he finally catches like listen,

151
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,440
even though listens moving towards him,

152
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:56,274
he didn't,

153
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,001
he doesn't even live here.

154
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:57,834
He's trying to hit him.

155
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,790
I wonder if they had like a,

156
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,580
they gave him a time where he
had to get knocked out too.

157
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,510
I mean it must be probably the first
robbery cause all the gambling on it.

158
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,111
Oh yeah.

159
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,190
I mean that was everything.

160
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,923
Here it is.

161
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,370
Boom.

162
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,203
Right there.

163
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,730
I mean that this is the fucking way.

164
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,440
There's is no fucking way.

165
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,130
But look,

166
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,670
we'll shit,

167
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,020
the way he's going down,

168
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,240
the way he gets up.

169
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:24,771
Oh look,

170
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:25,520
he's fake.

171
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,370
He could see him thinking I
should probably fall down here.

172
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,030
And he gets up finally and Jersey.

173
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:35,190
Joe Walcott as a referee to I believe.

174
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,900
Yep.

175
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,090
Yeah,

176
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,450
that's true.

177
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,283
Walcott

178
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,490
and something happened there and now
Ali's is tuning them up and then they

179
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,340
stopped the fight.

180
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,233
That's it.

181
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,580
So I guess he had reached a 10 power.

182
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,001
Got that.

183
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,110
He got up after that.

184
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,030
Here's the knockout in slow motion.

185
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:53,864
What?

186
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,231
I mean,

187
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:55,100
he does hit them.

188
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,600
Everybody calls it the Phantom Punch.

189
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:57,470
But watch this punch.

190
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,650
He definitely does hit him as listed.

191
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,291
Moves forward.

192
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,124
He does.

193
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,521
Boom.

194
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:03,260
See clean hit.

195
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,520
No doubt about it.

196
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,990
He definitely tagged him,

197
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,520
but it wasn't,

198
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,290
it wasn't the kind of punch that
would put a guy glistens out.

199
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,610
It'll probably stun him,

200
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,500
but I just,

201
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,050
it did.

202
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,700
I didn't believe that that was a real one.

203
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,534
Punch knockout.

204
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,720
Now watch that and I'll watch,

205
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,633
uh,

206
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,860
he came back against the
White Dude Jerry quarry.

207
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,471
Sure.

208
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,130
If that was his,

209
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,300
that was his comeback fight.

210
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,950
Muhammad Ali versus Jerry Quarry.

211
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,200
And when he fought Jerry quarry,

212
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:40,170
this was an after he had taken all
that time off and his body just looked

213
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,961
different.

214
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:41,794
Man.

215
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,880
He just like Jerry.

216
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:46,830
Cory was like a really tough guy
who by the way before he died,

217
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,700
couldn't even figure out how to walk.

218
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,440
Like you couldn't figure out where he was.

219
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,850
Didn't know where his underwear was.

220
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,061
Yeah,

221
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:52,930
he was gone.

222
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,180
He was,

223
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,561
he didn't know,

224
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,240
couldn't give you walked
out his front door.

225
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:56,470
It never make it back inside.

226
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,920
He was just gone.

227
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,080
You know,

228
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,290
all these target Daumier.

229
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,630
But if like if you look at Ollie's body,

230
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,100
like as Ali goes back,

231
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,160
the thing about Ali was that if
he wasn't training for a fight,

232
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,360
he wasn't working out.

233
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,140
So he didn't spend those three years
lifting weights and running hills and

234
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,220
fucking hitting the heavy bag.

235
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,720
He wasn't doing anything.

236
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,081
I mean,

237
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:20,000
he's probably just just fighting to
keep from getting locked up in jail,

238
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,020
you know?

239
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,550
But if you look at his
body like look at it,

240
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,860
he's all smooth and there's no muscles,

241
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,521
like,

242
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,180
look at him.

243
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,290
He looks like shit.

244
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,341
I mean,

245
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:30,860
he doesn't look anything
like he used to look.

246
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,551
I mean he's,

247
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,010
he's bouncing around a
little bit in the beginning,

248
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,190
but he's just not the same guy.

249
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,080
They still had some pretty
big fights at the end.

250
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,471
Yeah,

251
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:39,981
he did.

252
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,270
But he was never the same guy.

253
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,940
I never forget that Larry Holmes trying
to get the ref stopped the fight because

254
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,130
they didn't want to beat him up anymore.

255
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,911
That was awful.

256
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:47,960
It was his idol.

257
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,170
That was awful because that was after
Ali had no money left and he was really

258
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,490
suffering from Parkinson's already.

259
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,240
He was,

260
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,581
yeah,

261
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:57,740
I was already kicked in.

262
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,070
He was already in really bad shape.

263
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,470
Weight.

264
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:01,610
Oh,

265
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,421
is a friend of mine.

266
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,740
We used to work as Dorman together
and the doc Watson's in Philly.

267
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:10,741
It was Randall Cobb tax caught and we
saw him take a beat and from homes.

268
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,750
Yeah,

269
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,030
we were just going to
go down Randall go down.

270
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,860
Yeah,

271
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,680
it's fucking horrible.

272
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,920
That was the fight that made
Howard Cosell retire from boxing.

273
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,083
I remember that.

274
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,020
I'm done.

275
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,690
Let no mo look at that little monkey run

276
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,720
our co Sal who called like some of
the greatest fights of all time.

277
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,460
But like if you look at Ali here,

278
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:32,810
I mean he's still looks good,

279
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,120
but it's just not the same.

280
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,380
Ali just not the same guy.

281
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,581
He just,

282
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:39,050
his body doesn't look the same.

283
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:39,950
You smooth.

284
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,610
I mean,

285
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,380
granted he's had three years off,

286
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,214
but he's just,

287
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,001
I mean the,

288
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:49,001
the old Ali go now to Ali versus
Cleveland Big Cat Williams.

289
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,091
And I've always said,

290
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,530
if you want to look at it like Ali,

291
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:52,490
in his prime,

292
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,380
when Ali was in his prime,

293
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:54,561
his,

294
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,670
when he was fighting this guy,

295
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,210
Cleveland Williams and Cleveland
Williams is this big fucking scary,

296
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,140
murderous puncher and Mohammed Ali box.

297
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:05,120
This guy's fucking face off.

298
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:06,150
Who is the one that he,

299
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,260
when he was doing a,

300
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,941
what's my name?

301
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:08,774
What's my name?

302
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,621
Oh,

303
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,030
I'm shit.

304
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,923
Remember that?

305
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,840
Because the guy wouldn't,

306
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,140
clay called him calling him Cassius clay.

307
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:15,510
Yeah,

308
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,343
that's right.

309
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,530
I forget who that was.

310
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,640
God Damn.

311
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,910
I'd have to look at his records,

312
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,560
but Cleveland when was like,

313
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:22,681
look,

314
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:23,810
I'm muscular Williams.

315
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:28,760
His Mo Williams is a fucking animal
murderous puncher and he just could not

316
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:29,361
catch Holly.

317
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:30,740
This is Ali and his prime.

318
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,213
This is Ali,

319
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,540
like in 67 he was asleep.

320
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,160
He goes,

321
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,993
oh,

322
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,090
but the movement decided to side.

323
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:41,150
It was like there was no fucking
heavyweights at ever move to like that.

324
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,170
No one,

325
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,621
I mean,

326
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:47,621
he literally moved faster and lighter
on it's feet then most welterweights and

327
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:49,850
he was fighting a 200 plus pounds.

328
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:50,031
I mean,

329
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,290
I don't know what he weighed in his prime.

330
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,810
It's probably probably about
two 20 or something like that.

331
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,530
Do you ever see that picture
of him in the Beatles?

332
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,270
Uh,

333
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,781
which one?

334
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:58,601
Classic picture.

335
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:00,150
Just him at the Beatles in Miami.

336
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,770
Just a funny thing.

337
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,210
I'm trying to find out who
that guy was that did that.

338
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,810
I know my name.

339
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,160
Early careers got a bit of a process.

340
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:11,994
Cleveland.

341
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:12,721
Oh,

342
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:13,230
the hair?

343
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,560
Yeah.

344
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,730
They all used to like that.

345
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,170
Sugar Ray Robinson had that.

346
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,510
See what the conk they would call it.

347
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,480
Well you know who also is
great sugar ray Leonard.

348
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,771
Oh yeah,

349
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,280
dude.

350
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,020
It was why just shut it off.

351
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:25,680
Jamie.

352
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,610
Keep that shit on son.

353
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,950
I'm trying to find this guys name.

354
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,061
Jamie.

355
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:30,870
Hey Dylan.

356
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,740
Jamie's good over there.

357
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,311
Look at him.

358
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:35,290
Sexy Bitch motherfucker.

359
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,330
Jimmy Ellis.

360
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,291
Jimmy Ellis.

361
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,124
That's what it was.

362
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,460
Yeah.

363
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,910
Wow.

364
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,743
Pretty sure.

365
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,250
Pretty sure it's Jimmy Ellis.

366
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,740
Did you deal with as a
sparring page and two?

367
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,641
It probably was.

368
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:45,750
That's probably what happened.

369
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,720
Wouldn't knock 'em out
cause he was so mad at him.

370
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,230
Just beat his ass.

371
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,270
I'm almost positive was Ellis.

372
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,050
I'm sure somebody will curve
back to me if I'm wrong,

373
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:55,961
but if you,

374
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:56,610
um,

375
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,540
you watched his fight,

376
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,650
this in my opinion,

377
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,870
was like the quintessential
Ali and this was,

378
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,780
I believe the last fight
before he went away.

379
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,483
Um,

380
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,700
they just had never seen
anybody like this guy before.

381
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:11,400
He do in those three years
that he wasn't in prison?

382
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,031
No,

383
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,620
I think actually I think he fought,

384
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,080
they fought two more
times and then he went,

385
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,770
yeah,

386
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,810
he fought Ernie Terrell
and then Zara Foley.

387
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,953
Um,

388
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,060
he went to,

389
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:21,660
uh,

390
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,230
you know,

391
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,330
he had to fucking go to
court and they look at this,

392
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,441
God damn,

393
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,310
he was fast.

394
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,510
Look at this,

395
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,343
the legs,

396
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,370
pap,

397
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:29,990
pap,

398
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,230
pap,

399
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,063
pap pap,

400
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,190
and then out of there,

401
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,390
I mean he was,

402
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,950
he was barely getting hit back then,

403
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:35,490
man.

404
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,990
It was so fucking quick.

405
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,090
And then you see like his later fights,

406
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,500
like when he fought Joe Frazier,

407
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,450
like rumble in the jungle and you know,

408
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:42,961
there was just,

409
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:44,760
it was so much slower afoot.

410
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,160
Probably had knee problems by then.

411
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:47,731
And you know,

412
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,270
he took a,

413
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,140
and from Frazier,

414
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,060
they took a beating from each other.

415
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,301
Oh,

416
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:52,710
those were horrendous fights.

417
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,330
Those are horrendous fights.

418
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,800
His daughter told me it may.

419
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:56,760
May is a friend of mine,

420
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,200
his daughter remember meeting her.

421
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:59,520
I'm sure she was always at the store.

422
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:00,071
She's a comic,

423
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:00,300
right?

424
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,810
Yeah.

425
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,410
I used this.

426
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,090
I remember the first time I
brought her up and I said in about,

427
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:06,660
oh no,

428
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,890
she brought me up and I said,

429
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,000
maybe in La.

430
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,720
I said,

431
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,021
I always,

432
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:10,400
I was thinking,

433
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,780
thinking in the back of wonder if I
could beat all these daughter in a fight,

434
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,350
I probably not.

435
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,883
Yeah,

436
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,540
we'll definitely not the other one
that they love this beautiful Gary too.

437
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,800
She'll beat the shit out of here.

438
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,753
Yeah.

439
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,021
Beautiful.

440
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:28,680
And to beat your ass may amazing an
example of how a woman can be pretty and

441
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:29,550
look like her father.

442
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,420
Yeah.

443
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,781
Right,

444
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:31,111
right,

445
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:31,470
right.

446
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:31,681
You know,

447
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:35,400
he's got a son too that comes around the
comedy store or it used to come around

448
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:36,570
the comedy store back in the day.

449
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,320
I don't remember that.

450
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,561
Yeah.

451
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,020
And May may introduce me to
him one day and I was like,

452
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:40,501
Whoa,

453
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,300
this dude looks exactly like Muhammad Ali.

454
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,170
It was crazy.

455
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,941
And you know,

456
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,470
at the time he was fairly young,

457
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,613
big kid,

458
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:47,941
you know,

459
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:48,774
this was like,

460
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,490
I want to say 10 years ago maybe,

461
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,210
but Cleveland Williams was like this
like perfect style fighter to show like

462
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:59,170
Muhammad Ali in his best.

463
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,060
Like he just wasn't there man.

464
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:01,960
He's just wasn't there.

465
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:03,400
It was not nearly as quick.

466
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,390
Oh Man.

467
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,253
Like look at this,

468
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,010
look at that.

469
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,940
That's insane.

470
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,120
He was so slick and he just redefined
what it meant to be a professional boxer.

471
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:18,580
He introduced a whole new way of doing
it and now like there's a lot of MMA

472
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:20,770
fighters that use this style now.

473
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,880
I mean it's different because they
throw kicks and because takedowns are

474
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,691
incorporated into it,

475
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,830
but a lot of what they call,

476
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,390
they call it neo footwork movements like
Dominick Cruz is probably the best at

477
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:31,510
it.

478
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,010
He's the former bantamweight champion
and Tj Dillashaw who's a current

479
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:36,821
bantamweight champion.

480
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:41,821
Both guys are a great examples of people
that use this kind of misdirection and

481
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:44,350
footwork like constantly left to right,

482
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:45,184
right to left.

483
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,580
But those guys also
incorporates switching stances.

484
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:48,821
Like,

485
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:51,580
they'll fight southpaw and then
orthodox and Orthodox south by,

486
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:52,480
they go back and forth.

487
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,530
I'll get this Ali just right in front of
this dude and he can't do shit to him.

488
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,510
Um,

489
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,410
go to the knockout.

490
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,190
We see.

491
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,023
I don't know where,

492
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,500
where it is on this video.

493
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,300
It's can't be much further than this.

494
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,740
When's your next fight Joe?

495
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,880
The next UFC is next
weekend is a big one too.

496
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,300
Chris Weidman versus Vitor Belfort.

497
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,090
Vegas.

498
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,871
He'll get this dang.

499
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:14,470
Dang.

500
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,910
Oh son.

501
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,410
He stands over when his hands up.

502
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,810
Yeah.

503
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,201
Oh yeah.

504
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:20,470
He's,

505
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,610
that's real.

506
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,900
So that's the way he's breathing.

507
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,780
Very different than the
way Sonny Liston went down.

508
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,291
See that again?

509
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,360
Back it up again too.

510
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,820
There was,

511
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,830
I believe he got knocked down twice.

512
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,430
I might,

513
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,263
I might be wrong.

514
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,860
Yeah,

515
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,090
he got knocked down twice.

516
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,793
So look,

517
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,700
this is don't,

518
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,300
yeah,

519
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,260
back it up a little bit.

520
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:38,861
You could see the,

521
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:39,130
the,

522
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:39,963
the flurry.

523
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:41,951
No,

524
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:42,701
it was three times.

525
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,080
He got knocked down three times.

526
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,910
Yeah.

527
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,050
And then eventually put away.

528
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,101
But he's just,

529
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:48,401
you know,

530
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:49,540
kept trying to chase him,

531
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:49,931
chase him,

532
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:50,351
chase him,

533
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:50,800
pumping.

534
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,990
He knocked him down walking away.

535
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,311
God Damn,

536
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,210
that was beautiful.

537
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,200
The way he did that.

538
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,093
Oh,

539
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,570
I watched his fight.

540
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,550
I don't know how many times is this one
of my favorite all time performance is

541
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,384
of any box.

542
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:13,690
Okay.
