1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,280
Freak bitches and it's
just because he got mauled.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,210
It wasn't because skill wise he was
commensurate and then when floyd came back

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:09,811
in the rematch,

4
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:11,400
he just barked his face off,

5
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:14,760
just fucked him up because he
just wanted to let them know like,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,450
look dude,

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,610
I barely took you seriously
in that first fight.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,020
Got Close,

9
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,150
but it only got close
because like this sloppy bra.

10
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,820
And then you just put a skill
clinic on them in the second fight.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,530
Sacrifice wasn't even close.

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,010
I think that that's the only con,

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,730
but that's not how connor normally fight.

14
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:31,470
Sound like a swarming face.

15
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,210
First brawler type dude.

16
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:35,220
He's a guy who's like
cautious about getting hit.

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,050
Yeah.

18
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,620
I'm,

19
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,670
I'm thrilled about it,

20
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,750
but I'm also uh,

21
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:38,981
I,

22
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:39,290
I,

23
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,070
I wish,

24
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,431
I wish.

25
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:44,120
I wish I knew more about
your side of the tracks.

26
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,320
Well we don't know enough about
connor because connor has never had a

27
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:48,700
professional boxing match,

28
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,691
you know,

29
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,460
and the thing is you see as striking,

30
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:55,060
but you only see striking
when he's working on kicks
and wrestling and all that

31
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:55,440
other shit.

32
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,500
What if he just kicked him?

33
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,551
Like would that,

34
00:00:57,551 --> 00:01:00,280
I mean just to just do it,

35
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:01,000
just to let them know,

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,833
just to do it.

37
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,310
That'd be fucked up.

38
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,331
He fucked up,

39
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,500
but it would be hilarious.

40
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,910
Laughter.

41
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,311
You'd probably.

42
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:08,080
There's probably some
stipulations in the contract.

43
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,760
Say you can't get them in an arm bar

44
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,993
or choke them.

45
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,650
I think just kicking him in
the head and knock him out.

46
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:17,560
It would be worth losing all the money
and then getting more money after that.

47
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,140
Imagine he would be a god folk hero.

48
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,760
If they got in close,

49
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,690
if they got any clothes and floyd was
like sucking in Juke on the outside and he

50
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:29,590
threw a jab to cover up or left
high kick and that left high kick.

51
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:30,041
Next,

52
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:30,874
I'm just.

53
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,300
Can you see floyd go limp
and he would go limp.

54
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,100
He'd never been high kick like that.

55
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,621
Jesus.

56
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:41,140
That would be crazy because
he didn't know it was coming.

57
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,850
He could clip on with it.

58
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,810
Like if you had no idea if you hit a
kick behind a punch like fighter is a lot

59
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,790
of fighters do to like throw a punch.

60
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,230
Literally a cover your face.

61
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,720
So the kick is behind it
already and then boom,

62
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,590
the kit comes like why your vision is
already you're thinking about the next

63
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:59,890
punch and bang the kid glance and
you get chaos happens all the time.

64
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,050
If he did that would be insane.

65
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,483
Would it be worth it?

66
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,560
It wouldn't be with fuck everything up
because no one would ever trust another

67
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:12,160
fighter from mma to ever fight
a boxer in a boxing match again,

68
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,233
because we've only had the.

69
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,890
The opposite happened really.

70
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,950
You know,

71
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,340
she,

72
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,320
she quit in a lot of people quit.

73
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:21,350
I worked search and rescue in
Alaska and Denali for years in.

74
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,940
And you'd be amazed at how
many people are just like done,

75
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,180
you know,

76
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,290
just lay down and they're done because
they're not rational enough to know.

77
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,650
Like if I sit down and I just took this
a little bitty nappy ain't getting back

78
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:33,880
up.

79
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,630
You're taking a snap and you're done.

80
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:35,870
Yeah.

81
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,470
I mean that's.

82
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,870
No,

83
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,703
no,

84
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:37,930
no.

85
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,530
Now I don't like that.

86
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:42,200
So that's a weird term.

87
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,940
But with hypothermia,

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,880
the interesting thing that
happens is you get euphoric,

89
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:47,870
right?

90
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,300
You go through this stage of super cold,

91
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:50,771
super cold,

92
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,170
and your core temperature drops low
enough to where you for year comes in.

93
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:58,520
So oftentimes it was saying people
we would find our undressed,

94
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,623
so get hot.

95
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,300
You get warm so the gloves come off.

96
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,290
The hats come off the pants and
unzipped and you know everybody's,

97
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,690
everybody's buck naked on the side of
the mountain right before they die,

98
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:09,190
before they die.

99
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,540
So I mean,

100
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,010
not that I want to go out that way,

101
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,170
but I can think of worse way.

102
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,150
So it gets you for it apparently.

103
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,130
Wow.

104
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,970
Because we've also pull people back.

105
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,490
I've seen multiple times when we pulled
people back and they discussed that,

106
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,330
they described it

107
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,530
and then we start rewarming there.

108
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,910
Frostbite and Shit's not right after that.

109
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,163
That hurts.

110
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,243
That hurts.

111
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,800
Frostbite is so horrible
to look at it too.

112
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:39,700
It's just shoot this stuff we had to
see and her fingers are still half half

113
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,534
fingers are off.

114
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,120
She sent me pictures.

115
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,000
She's missing fingers.

116
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,523
Missing tips.

117
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,101
Tips.

118
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:45,700
Yeah.

119
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,360
She's lucky.

120
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,220
Some of the Phalanges
are going chopped up,

121
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,320
so they got her down.

122
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:53,440
They ended up hours and hours and
hours and we're tracking and we're,

123
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,550
we're trying to talk to them.

124
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,200
They get her down to camp four.

125
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,780
Which does that track that you saw then?

126
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,340
The trickiest part as he'll tell you.

127
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,310
Because I can't tell you
can't afford a camp three.

128
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,240
Yeah.

129
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,370
Can't afford to camp three.

130
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,350
And then camp three to camp two,

131
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,520
which they didn't even do.

132
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,210
They couldn't get.

133
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,410
They couldn't get to camp two,

134
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,710
which is straight on
the LHOTSE lhotse face.

135
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:15,100
It's a,

136
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,710
it's about a 60 slash 60 degree ice face,

137
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,780
which is slick.

138
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,880
So when you're roping somebody down,

139
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,040
you know it,

140
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,370
it actually does provide,

141
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:24,970
you know,

142
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,631
less friction.

143
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,100
You can actually slide somebody down,

144
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,860
but you can't get going too fast,

145
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,690
you know.

146
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,990
So now you're at 25,

147
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,611
26,

148
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,690
27,000 feet.

149
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,860
You're 130 pounds,

150
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,160
125 pound shirt,

151
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:39,580
but you get to lower
this 200 pound lady down.

152
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,291
Hard oxygen.

153
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,220
And these guys are working on right now.

154
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,690
She's 200 pounds.

155
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,553
Well,

156
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,700
she wasn't that big,

157
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,720
but you know,

158
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,040
with all our gear and all 160,

159
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,430
270 pounds worth of weight,

160
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,280
you know,

161
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,220
dead weight just lower down.

162
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,690
So we got her down,

163
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:59,320
we got her down to where we could go in
with a helicopter and we picked her up

164
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:02,950
and took her back down to base camp and
that was when the meeting took place

165
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:04,350
between her and her husband,

166
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,021
the tearful,

167
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:05,771
rejoicing.

168
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,920
And so the part you missed
was the helicopter landed.

169
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,180
It couldn't land at camp two.

170
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:12,250
We weren't supposed to go up to 23,500,

171
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,410
which at the base of
low t a crampon point.

172
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,900
Andrew got there and said,

173
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,060
I can only pick one of you.

174
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,350
And she looked at her husband and said,

175
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
you stay until he made his day
and take the next helicopter out.

176
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,060
So we got her down and she
looked at her husband and said,

177
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:28,960
you stayed like pitch.

178
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,794
You quit.

179
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,151
Well,

180
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,440
she was mad because he got left.

181
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,513
She was pissed off.

182
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,930
She was pissed that she got left,

183
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:36,280
but he couldn't have carried her.

184
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,380
Know that you're switching.

185
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,131
It depends,

186
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,750
there's ways looking at it both ways.

187
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,740
Somebody quit,

188
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,880
somebody gave up,

189
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:43,780
somebody said no,

190
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,673
I mean who knows,

191
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,280
but I'm sure that had to go sue through
some deep ass therapy when they got

192
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:48,550
home.

193
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,911
Okay.

194
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:50,290
So I'm going to.

195
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,580
I'm going to fill in the gaps here.

196
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:56,581
So fast forward a nine
or 10 months and dude,

197
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,701
husband has a,

198
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,080
he has a heart attack and died.

199
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,640
So he died.

200
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm sorry I shouldn't be laughing.

201
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,470
That's Kinda fucked up.

202
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,450
It's fucked up.

203
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,320
But man,

204
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,480
you're going to everest and then you had.

205
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,830
I'm a little more of the,

206
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,431
you know,

207
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,360
the shandling,

208
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,660
tons and tons of paper until
you're drowning and confused.

209
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,540
Shan Lane.

210
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,930
That's a sad one man.

211
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,520
Have Fun dude.

212
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:23,960
That was oh the best.

213
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:28,961
And I'm doing a documentary about him now
for HBO and so the most fun part about

214
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:34,100
it is he always went to the comedy
magic club and did stand up even in eras

215
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,810
where you didn't know he was doing it.

216
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,380
That's where I met him
at the comedy Magic Club.

217
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,440
And how was,

218
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,430
he was great.

219
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,181
He just,

220
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:41,960
I mean it was like,

221
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,740
for me,

222
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,500
I was a huge fan of Larry Sanders
show and Larry Sanders show.

223
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,510
That's where Paul Simms got to start the
producer of news radio and so when I,

224
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,200
you know,

225
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,761
when I saw him,

226
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:52,400
I was like,

227
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,360
it was one of those ones like,

228
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,150
oh wow,

229
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,900
a,

230
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,020
that's actually garry
shandling right there,

231
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,220
right there with Jed apatow.

232
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,060
It's right there.

233
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,073
It's a weird one.

234
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,243
And He,

235
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,830
and you know,

236
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,631
the comedy magical,

237
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,310
they tape every show since the eighties.

238
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:05,270
They have every show taped.

239
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,050
Yeah.

240
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,883
And I said,

241
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,030
can you give me the last
50 sets that Gary did?

242
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,290
The comedy Magic Club,

243
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,780
and this is Ito from the last few years,

244
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,710
and no one's ever seen any of these
jokes except the people at those shows.

245
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:19,670
He didn't do them on TV.

246
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:20,810
He didn't do them on talk shows.

247
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,770
There was no special.

248
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,040
Some of the funniest jokes you ever heard.

249
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,903
Just him,

250
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,110
you know,

251
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,000
working on the craft.

252
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,290
How about be being so funny?

253
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,660
Yeah,

254
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,980
but he did a lot of notes.

255
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,600
He was a,

256
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,540
his discipline guy.

257
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,880
He was in the seventies.

258
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,800
He wrote so many jokes.

259
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,150
I found these binders,

260
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,650
hundreds and hundreds of jokes
in every loose leaf binder,

261
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,270
like a guy sitting at a desk all
day just crafting like two sentence.

262
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,550
Perfect jokes.

263
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:52,791
Yeah.

264
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:53,870
But there's like the balance,

265
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:54,141
right?

266
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:54,770
There's that.

267
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,250
There's crafting the perfect jokes and
then there's just being able to be loose

268
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,860
and fun and hilarious.

269
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,371
Well,

270
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,200
he also used to go on stage with a,

271
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,190
just a setup and he wouldn't know the
punchline and he would say the setup and

272
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:08,390
hope the punchline came,

273
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,820
which was pretty wild.

274
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:11,121
He,

275
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:11,954
um,

276
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,071
you know,

277
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:13,600
one of the,

278
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,550
one of the great things about doing a
documentary as you get to ask people for

279
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:17,091
footage,

280
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,130
so Seinfeld gave me,

281
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,120
uh,

282
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,410
the dailies for Comedians in cars
getting coffee when he interviewed Gary.

283
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,850
And then the people who made the movie
comedian about Seinfeld gave me all the

284
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:33,620
dailies of a sequence that they only
use 10 seconds of the documentary,

285
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,480
which was Gary and Jerry going to
the comedy magic club and doing sets.

286
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:43,481
And also there that night as Neil
and Chris Rock and there's 12 tapes.

287
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,440
It's all their performances.

288
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:50,441
And then their entire conversation for
three hours hanging out backstage and it

289
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,090
is unbelievable the conversation,

290
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,530
how funny it is.

291
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,940
And uh,

292
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,760
there's a moment where Chris rock is doing
the joke about how Nelson Mandela got

293
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,300
divorced,

294
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,830
that even Nelson Mandela,

295
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,960
after decades of being in prison,

296
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:07,830
he could survive that,

297
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,710
but he couldn't survive
getting out and being married,

298
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,940
divorced immediately.

299
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,410
I forget how he worded it,

300
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,920
but there's a shot of shandling alone in
a green room watching rock do this bit.

301
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,030
And as he's doing it,

302
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:24,030
Gary's saying what he,

303
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,520
what he's like,

304
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,220
he's guessing what the
bit is as rock saying it,

305
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:32,310
but in all of Chris Rock and it's a,

306
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:34,920
it's a really beautiful moment.

307
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,480
And that's what the best part
of doing this documentary is.

308
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:41,430
It just finding little magical moments
that no one would ever see if you didn't

309
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:41,970
dig deep.
