1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,670
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,260
there's a blog I read about Finn
privilege just to sit there.

3
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:06,981
That's another thing.

4
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:08,960
That's another way of saying fat shaming.

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,460
The other side of saying fat shaming is
that being thin you were enjoying thin

6
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,110
privilege and that by
creating success and all that,

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,720
not just dating success but
the way people dress you in,

8
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:25,160
the way you move around in society
that you enjoy thin privilege and what

9
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:29,880
they're trying to do is compare being
in shape with being a white male like

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,120
white male privilege is white.

11
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:34,070
Male privilege is almost shameful.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:34,791
You know,

13
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:38,080
it's almost shameful to have this white
male privilege while people are stuck.

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,500
It's,

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,590
it makes you feel,

16
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,390
uh,

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:40,910
like the,

18
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,340
the,

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,700
like if someone talks
about white male privilege,

20
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:44,534
what do you think of,

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,080
you think of someone being
aloof to the concerns of,

22
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,140
of Brown people and poor people and racism
and also allude to the fact that they

23
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:55,940
got super lucky.

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,940
They got this lucky roll the dice and
were born in this way that allows them to

25
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:02,774
be.

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,231
I mean,

27
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:07,100
if you think about white males thinking
about white males and you think about

28
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:07,880
wealth,

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,240
majority of the like super
wealthy people are white males.

30
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,910
The majority of the people
that are in positions of power,

31
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:14,840
whether it's presidents,

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,590
mayor,

33
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,423
white males,

34
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,940
so that white male being a white male
and have that privilege is almost like

35
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:20,774
being in a pig.

36
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,840
It's like being the man so thin privilege.

37
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,840
They've figured out a way to
make being fin being a pig.

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,570
You've got to knock
willpower of that list.

39
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,460
There is no lack of willpower and fat
people willpower's a finite resource.

40
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,440
You have so much against.

41
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,830
We prove this beyond a doubt.

42
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,240
What do you mean willpower?

43
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,800
There's a whole book about this now,

44
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,170
and I'm forgetting the name of the author,

45
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,350
but they actually show that there's
so many decisions you can make.

46
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,550
I wrote about this a while back.

47
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:50,730
There's decision making fatigue and
there's x amount of willpower and you can

48
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,230
apply that will power to change the world.

49
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,260
Or you can apply that willpower to say
no to the bowl of chips in front of you.

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,280
Right?

51
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,950
And if you're a fat person and
your energy reserves are low,

52
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,480
and I say this from personal experience,

53
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,950
the amount of willpower it takes to get
up off the couch and walk across the

54
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,270
street and do whatever you're going to do,

55
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,880
it requires a hell of a lot more weird,

56
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,300
more willpower than you would think it
would as a healthy person because your

57
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,111
cells aren't working,

58
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:13,980
you don't have the energy,

59
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:17,100
and yet you get up and you do it in
every step you take is sapping your

60
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,050
willpower in a way a
healthy person doesn't have.

61
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:19,951
Oh,

62
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,784
I see what you're saying.

63
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Saying that even though willpower is
sort of an individual characteristic and

64
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,801
some people have it,

65
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:28,634
some people don't.

66
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,320
With fat people,

67
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:34,940
it's almost like a catch 22 because
although they need it to drop away,

68
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,300
they're not gonna have it because
they needed to just move around.

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,470
Their energy levels are lower so they
have less willpower and they're using the

70
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:45,800
willpower to do simple things that
are effortless for you and it's not

71
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:46,940
effortless for a fat person.

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,060
That is such an interesting point and
one that I really didn't consider.

73
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,820
That's a very unique point because I,

74
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:55,610
I never really considered
that fat people like,

75
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,310
it's almost like they
can't help themselves.

76
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,203
It's almost like they're,

77
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,540
we'll or it's so much more difficult for
them to pass on shitty food than it is

78
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,500
a regular person.

79
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:05,750
Well,

80
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,640
think of it like this.

81
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,580
If you're a regular person
that's been privileged.

82
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,700
What branch of the military army?

83
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,983
How long were you in for?

84
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,740
Three.

85
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,251
Three years?

86
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:15,461
Well,

87
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,300
six years total.

88
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,470
What year was this?

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,260
80 two to 85 and then reserves
from 85 to eight years.

90
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:22,800
Let's you BA boom.

91
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,730
You out a wig.

92
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,200
That's just real.

93
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,063
Yo.

94
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,790
Did you get anything out
of being in the military?

95
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,820
Yeah,

96
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,653
discipline.

97
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,230
Yeah.

98
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,520
Just,

99
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:37,751
you know,

100
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,630
just again,

101
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:39,440
just being,

102
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,010
being responsible response ability,

103
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,440
the ability to respond.

104
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,050
Yeah.

105
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,730
People that have gone through that,

106
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,970
it's very interesting to see.

107
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,420
I had a friend who was a real lazy and
Kinda shiftless and never got anything

108
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,750
done and then went away,

109
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,800
went to bootcamp,

110
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,870
came back and this motherfucker
always folded his napkin after that.

111
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,500
Sat Up Straight and got
shit done and I was like,

112
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,393
wow.

113
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,730
They turned this dude around
like they're really did.

114
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,680
I wouldn't recommend it today because
joining today have a high likelihood of

115
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,280
either being forced to assassinate
someone for the government or finding

116
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,550
yourself in a position where you really
wouldn't want to be and people are

117
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:31,030
shooting out you that don't like
Americans and unless it's your calling,

118
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,410
I wouldn't really recommend it.

119
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:33,760
But goddamn,

120
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,090
for some people it
really is a game changer.

121
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,893
I agree.

122
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,360
Yeah.

123
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,680
And not all.

124
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,090
Not everyone can make it through it.

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,570
It's.

126
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,403
But the,

127
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,450
a lot of guys that kind of washed
out during that whole basic training.

128
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,600
What made you join College
Fund for Art School?

129
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,913
Really?

130
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,520
Will you pretty convinced that we weren't
going to go to war during those times

131
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,300
completely.

132
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,133
I was like,

133
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,323
war,

134
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:02,930
you know,

135
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,500
I didn't,

136
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,580
I just didn't believe it.

137
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:05,810
And then uh,

138
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,183
I got,

139
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,470
I got appointed to go,

140
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,630
I got a long process,

141
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:14,150
but basically it got handed a,

142
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:17,630
an opportunity to go to west point by
going to the preparatory school for a year

143
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,363
and uh,

144
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,430
got to the end when I finally got
my appointment to go to west point,

145
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,290
they said basically you have to forfeit
your army college fund to go to art

146
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,124
school.

147
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,280
And I didn't really go into
be a career military person.

148
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:34,370
I kind of went into get college
fund so I can go pursue the arts,

149
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,301
but,

150
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:35,601
you know,

151
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,381
but you're being,

152
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:36,711
again,

153
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,090
I was being my behavior as being
ready to forest as far as my,

154
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,210
the way I was excelling
as an in the military.

155
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,470
Um,

156
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,940
so it was very tempting to go,

157
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,140
I can be an officer,

158
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,573
let's do that.

159
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,571
And then you get,

160
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:50,960
you know,

161
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,160
it got to that moment where I had to,

162
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:52,311
like,

163
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,230
I had to make that
decision in that moment.

164
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:59,231
You have basically I had like three
hours to check the yes box that accept my

165
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:04,030
appointment or check
the no box and you know,

166
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,270
go back into the regular army.

167
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,050
And they go back to them,

168
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,080
go to art school and I chose,

169
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,080
I chose art school.

170
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,150
Alright.

171
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,460
And I,

172
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,690
if I had not done that,

173
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,240
I would have provided I
made it through west point,

174
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,320
which is not a guarantee.

175
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,760
If I'd have made it through west point,

176
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:19,340
I would have been in the first
Gulf war as a lieutenant.

177
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,990
Wow.

178
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,330
That's fucking crazy.

179
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,700
Well,

180
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,630
it also begs the question,

181
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,460
all of this stuff begs the question like,

182
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,481
first of all,

183
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:33,680
everyone's favorite argument is if you
have nothing to hide then what are you

184
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:34,514
worried about?

185
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,690
And it's not that.

186
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,880
What it is is first of all,

187
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,840
why do you need so much
information and what?

188
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,470
What have you done that have
made so many people so angry?

189
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,270
They have to check everyone's email.

190
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:51,080
Like what is the actual cause of
all this that never gets addressed.

191
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,370
Like whenever we're talking about how
this group hates us of that group hates us

192
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:56,270
and this group is playing.

193
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,620
Why?

194
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,510
Why?

195
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,270
What did we do?

196
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,380
I want to go with what you said that
the if you have nothing to hide,

197
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,131
because I was just.

198
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,830
I was trying to get a show up before
I came here and I failed miserably,

199
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,450
but one of the things I
was going to talk about,

200
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,130
did you see that story?

201
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,200
The lawsuit filed from that incident in
New Mexico with the driver who didn't do

202
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,120
the full stop leaving Walmart.

203
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:17,570
You saw it,

204
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,020
right?

205
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,350
Right.

206
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,830
So.

207
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,590
So the police pulled them over for,

208
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,830
for California,

209
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:22,970
stopping the stop sign.

210
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,260
Decide that he looks like he's
clenching his buttocks in a weird way,

211
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,570
and this is the part I love most to a
judge and says to the judge while this guy

212
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,020
is sitting on the side of the road,

213
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:36,980
he's clenching his buttocks.

214
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:37,581
In a weird way.

215
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:41,330
I think we have somebody trying to
hide drugs in there and the judge goes,

216
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,980
I guess judging from the story,

217
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,791
yeah,

218
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,290
that would be probable cause.

219
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,050
So they take this guy to a doctor who
refuses to do with the police officers

220
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,240
asked.

221
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,560
So they've got to go to another doctor.

222
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,910
Fourteen hours of anal cavity searches,

223
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,153
enemas.

224
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,650
They sedated him and did a colonoscopy.

225
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,040
They examined his stuff
right in front of him.

226
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,210
Fourteen hours,

227
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,111
found nothing.

228
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,190
X rayed him multiple times,

229
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,053
found nothing,

230
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,990
and then apparently send them a
$6,000 bill for the procedure.

231
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,040
So when you say,

232
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,760
what have you got to hide if any,

233
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:15,930
you.

234
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,670
Unless you're Heidi,

235
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,890
that's what can happen to you if.

236
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,570
And not just that.

237
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,790
What I love is the police
department spokesman said,

238
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,750
we didn't do anything wrong.

239
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,800
This is policy,

240
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:26,330
and we had a judge sign off on it.

241
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,111
So when you say,

242
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,310
if you have nothing to hide,

243
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,144
what do you care?

244
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,560
This guy had nothing to hide
and that happened to him.

245
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,350
Clearly did because he was away.

246
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,081
I know,

247
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,080
but now now that story's
true and the lawsuit,

248
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:42,140
claims witnesses and all this kind of
stuff and the police officers think

249
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:43,310
nothing was wrong there.

250
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,850
That's what happens to you when you get
rid of these protections that keep you

251
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:49,040
from being searched willy
nilly or anything like that.

252
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,360
But after a story like that,

253
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,490
everyone in the ward was going
to be stopped by the police.

254
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,070
Who's going to clean this
bathroom a weird way.

255
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,780
It's just the theater of the stories,

256
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,963
like

257
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,630
people that are bought freaks
and that's what they're into.

258
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:05,190
They're into cops checking them
out and treasures up there,

259
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,990
put secrets up there too.

260
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,970
I didn't mean to take
the conversation though.

261
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,910
It's a great direction.

262
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,990
It's hilarious.

263
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,540
It's.

264
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:13,741
It's.

265
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:13,951
Well,

266
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:16,080
it's fucked up that if you search,

267
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:18,660
someone's asked for 14 hours
and there's nothing up there.

268
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,850
That guy should be able to
search your house for 28.

269
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,530
That should be the rule.

270
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,630
You should be able to throw
firecrackers in there.

271
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,190
And come on,

272
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:26,550
man.

273
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,440
He checked his ass for no reason.

274
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:30,420
Like you owe him something.

275
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,810
What bothers me about that is that there's
no penalty that actually affects the

276
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:34,830
people who did this.

277
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,210
In other words,

278
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,110
if this guy wins is big
lawsuit against them,

279
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
that's the taxpayers who
are going to pay that.

280
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,370
The people who did it don't suffer at all.
