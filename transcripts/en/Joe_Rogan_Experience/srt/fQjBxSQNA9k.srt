1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,020
Man that PRP,

2
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:03,930
platelet rich plasma with stem
cells is that Shit Dude in Vegas?

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,321
Yeah.

4
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:05,131
One week later,

5
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:06,240
my elbows feeling great.

6
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,400
It's the Brian counts show,

7
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:07,661
ladies.

8
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:07,981
Gentlemen.

9
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:08,970
We are live.

10
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:12,810
They Brian Callen MMA kaolin spectacular.

11
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,243
That's right.

12
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,330
Fresh off a Christmas.

13
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,640
Everybody had a bit of the flu.

14
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,191
Touch the flu.

15
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,130
Put me on my back for a
couple hours every day.

16
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,600
Did you get that rally shirt?

17
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,020
Did you get the flu shots?

18
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,530
Nope.

19
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:22,921
Did Not.

20
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,310
I should.

21
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,091
Who gets the shot?

22
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:24,924
I don't get those.

23
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,910
I should lose up 70%.

24
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,570
Yeah,

25
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:27,930
yeah,

26
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,261
yeah.

27
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:33,180
Well apparently it's a very complicated
thing to try to nail which flu virus is

28
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:34,900
going to hit people and they don't get it.

29
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,671
They don't get it.

30
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:36,000
Right.

31
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,720
A lot.

32
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:36,940
Yeah.

33
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,250
The CDC will sometimes be like,

34
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:38,491
listen,

35
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,380
we just checked this flu's coming in.

36
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,360
It's a bitch.

37
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,440
But here's the problem.

38
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,660
A lot of times I'll even admit
when you get the flu shot,

39
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,520
it doesn't take,

40
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,120
it doesn't,

41
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,530
it helps a little bit.

42
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,080
Um,

43
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,901
it will make the film.

44
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:51,990
You get less,

45
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,080
you can get the flu.

46
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,870
That's what they're injecting
the flu and the flu shot.

47
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:56,704
It's like the sickest,

48
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,570
it's the dengue virus,

49
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,881
but it has,

50
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:02,180
there's a reaction that some
people have to do it right?

51
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,281
Yeah.

52
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:03,114
You can never know.

53
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,013
You can have a,

54
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,070
when you're sick,

55
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:06,630
if you're about to get sick
or you're feeling sick,

56
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:07,500
don't get the flu shot.

57
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,334
They say,

58
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,330
yeah.

59
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,460
They say don't get it when your
immune system's compromised,

60
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,210
but sometimes they can give you the flu
shot and everybody will get the flu and

61
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:15,690
you won't.

62
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,680
So it does work.

63
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:17,100
Yes,

64
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,970
sometimes.

65
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:18,480
Yeah,

66
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,313
but I don't do it.

67
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:19,921
I need to.

68
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:20,371
I just don't,

69
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:20,551
you know,

70
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,080
it's like,

71
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,290
do I want to go in there and get a shot?

72
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:22,891
I'm a pussy.

73
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:23,220
I'm like,

74
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,700
ah,

75
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,870
I'll just get sick for 10 minutes.

76
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:25,890
I just don't want to do it.

77
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:26,430
I'll tell you what,

78
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,370
if I'm Francis or if I'm steep,

79
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,300
am trying to give fucking Francis the flu.

80
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,680
A little segue lotion.

81
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,950
Fucking poisonous.

82
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,620
Some North Korean just,

83
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,641
Oh yeah.

84
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,290
Something.

85
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,300
They found that North Korean
soldier that defected.

86
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,760
He had been vaccinated against anthrax.

87
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,480
What?

88
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,290
Yeah.

89
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:46,651
And they're like,

90
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:47,040
wait,

91
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,873
what?

92
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:48,810
Yeah.

93
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,550
He's the second guy that
defected in a month.

94
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:50,971
Oh yeah.

95
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:51,640
What did that guy,

96
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:51,960
oh yeah,

97
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,201
cause I,

98
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:52,811
the first guy,

99
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:56,600
they found like crazy parasites in his,

100
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,180
in his thing and he was
eating raw like everything.

101
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,390
They're starving to death over there.

102
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:02,220
And North Korea.

103
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,020
Well communism works especially,

104
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:04,854
it doesn't turn into,

105
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,010
it's a monarchy.

106
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,331
It's not,

107
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:08,970
communism was asked all you
fucking freaks out there.

108
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,220
All you young millennials were beads.

109
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,820
Just getting into Korea.

110
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,220
Look,

111
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,130
I'm not your history,

112
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:14,941
a history major,

113
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:17,750
but I know enough about history
to know about Marxism law.

114
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,010
Especially after talking to
Jordan Peterson about her.

115
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,980
I dove deep and do it.

116
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:21,350
It just great.

117
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,691
It was like,

118
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:21,970
what?

119
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,100
What is the history of this stuff?

120
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,300
It's all terrible.

121
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,100
Of course it doesn't work.

122
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,690
No,

123
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,030
it's like,

124
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,010
it's not human nature.

125
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,710
You need,

126
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,420
you need a central power.

127
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,180
You need someone to keep
the ones that are getting,

128
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,890
I talked to an academic the other day,

129
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,371
I said,

130
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:35,881
so what are you saying?

131
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:36,780
He just kept talking about the,

132
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,330
the,

133
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,060
um,

134
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,790
and he's talking about the Scandinavian
system of government and how great it

135
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:41,911
was.

136
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,330
I go.

137
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,060
When was the last time you bought
something made in Scandinavia?

138
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,110
I like Scandinavia,

139
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,280
like sobs,

140
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,570
sobs and Ikea is kind sobs,

141
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,590
a good call.

142
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,840
There are certain things we're talking
about an iPad right now are the ones that

143
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,530
you know that everything
was made in the marketplace.

144
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,693
Fuck.

145
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,220
Well

146
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,870
it's definitely a smaller place too,

147
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:02,141
right?

148
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:02,491
You know,

149
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:03,330
you're not dealing with it.

150
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,790
It's called [inaudible] and Sweden.

151
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,680
What's the last good thing Russia made?

152
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,103
It's a good point.

153
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:10,530
Not,

154
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,710
not the Kalashnikov.

155
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,380
Yeah,

156
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,880
the Kalashnikov and they made
some good rifles and they made,

157
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,360
so they had some good strides
they made in rocketry.

158
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:19,841
You know,

159
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,370
there were the first guy
to put a guy into orbit,

160
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,380
although the absolutely did fake the
video footage that they released of Eureka

161
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,870
Garr off.

162
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,320
Is that his name?

163
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,153
Yuri Gagarin.

164
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,720
Yuri Gagarin in space.

165
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,140
They've proven that there's no way you
could get the kind of camera that you

166
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,610
would need to record that.

167
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,070
Which film in that small capsule that
he was floating around in space and,

168
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,850
and then there's light
coming from two dogs.

169
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,920
So they have like lights
on these dump Fox.

170
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,001
They have lights on him,

171
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,830
he's going to cabin and he's faking that.

172
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,560
He's like,

173
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,140
I think he really did do it,

174
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,600
but they didn't really get
footage of him doing so.

175
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:50,500
They fixed the footage,

176
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,430
get that footage that the Russians have
bumping into because Russia has just

177
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:55,001
propaganda.

178
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,834
They all did it.

179
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,580
The Russians are amazing at anything.

180
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,680
They put their mind to like that.

181
00:03:58,681 --> 00:03:59,710
The culture itself,

182
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:00,730
they work so hard.

183
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,050
Like when if you look at them,

184
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:02,321
they're like,

185
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,130
we want to be great.

186
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,210
Powerlifters great,

187
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,081
great wrestlers.

188
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,640
Anything that [inaudible] doing
steroids even that really?

189
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,430
Did you watch that movie?

190
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:11,780
[inaudible] Fogel Movie Chris?

191
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,370
Yeah.

192
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,050
How fucking crazy so that
everybody doing everybody,

193
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,640
everybody,

194
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,880
everybody banned.

195
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,081
They banned them.

196
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,060
But here's what's really squirrely band.

197
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,650
One of the things they did,

198
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:26,410
they took a metals away
from a couple of people,

199
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,891
but the people,

200
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,640
they take metals away,

201
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,031
like they say,

202
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,600
you can't compete in this sport and
now they've pulled them out of a couple

203
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,340
sports that nobody gives a fuck about.

204
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,720
And here's the other problem,

205
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,820
the IOC and Wada,

206
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,320
the world antidoping agency,

207
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,540
they're completely interconnected.

208
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,950
People work for both of them.

209
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,690
They go back and forth
in between each other.

210
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,710
They have an incestuous relationship and
that was all exposed by Bryan Fogel in

211
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:48,191
that movie.

212
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,350
It's a fucking great movie and Chris,

213
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:51,161
if you haven't seen it,

214
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,320
you want to know like
the depths of doping.

215
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,161
I love that guy.

216
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,880
I love that Russia Russian guy
was fascinating to me and he,

217
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,970
he had been an athlete and then he's
in a witness protection program,

218
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:01,121
right?

219
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,740
I mean he's basically afraid for his life.

220
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,603
Yes.

221
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,050
Russia is banned from the 2018 Olympics
and the athletes are told to compete

222
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,700
under the Olympic flag.

223
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,260
You're not representing a company,

224
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,310
so a country rather.

225
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,140
So now the Olympics are a country.

226
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,841
Olympics.

227
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:15,551
Got to get their own country.

228
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,900
That's going to be the new
America elliptical there.

229
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,690
The concert dad state,

230
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,370
most of these states,

231
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,240
it's state sponsored and the antibiotics
were coming out of China I think,

232
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,070
and not all over crazy.

233
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,310
If you think rushes is the only one crazy,

234
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:30,144
you're crazy.

235
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,780
China did the same thing.

236
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,260
Bryan Fogel pointed out the China
did the exact same thing in Beijing.

237
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,960
They want all these fucking
gold metals like crazy.

238
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:41,290
They were winning gold medals and when
there's a disproportionate amount of gold

239
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,120
medals that are being
one in your home country.

240
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,620
Yeah,

241
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,453
got an old car.

242
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:44,870
Okay.

243
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,370
I'm skeptical.

244
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:45,671
Hip Off.

245
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:45,890
Oh,

246
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,080
why?

247
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,270
Oh,

248
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,921
why am I a little,

249
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:47,300
uh,

250
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,430
why am I a little concerned here that
the financial gains of making that many

251
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:54,880
Olympic gold medals are
so fucking irresistible,

252
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,181
dude,

253
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:56,650
look what it did for Jamaica.

254
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,440
Oh yeah.

255
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,160
You don't make

256
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,260
it on how the fast burners in the world,

257
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,123
Brandon,

258
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,230
they're not known for that kind of,

259
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,830
that kind of national or

260
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,770
international sports now.

261
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,111
Right.

262
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:13,111
But there's no denying that there is an
extreme and rampant abuse of performance

263
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:14,924
nursing drive,

264
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,440
but up,

265
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,531
up,

266
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:15,651
up,

267
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:15,771
up,

268
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,430
up.

269
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:16,571
No,

270
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:17,950
they haven't been causing for k one guys,

271
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,410
they took the relay gold medal after
call the beast and he might've been,

272
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,510
I think they're all called the beast.

273
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:23,751
Well,

274
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,700
when I was talking to victor contact,

275
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,601
who is,

276
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:27,201
by the way,

277
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:29,300
as balls deep into that world as possible,

278
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,370
the ultimate snitch of snitches,

279
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,460
snitches,

280
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,851
first team,

281
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:35,440
all snitch.

282
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,020
It's the guy who was the head of
Balco who made that clear shit.

283
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,050
It was undetectable for a little while
until they figured out how to detect it,

284
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,303
which is what they always do.

285
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,650
He said all the track and field's dirty.

286
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,640
Of course,

287
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,360
all of it.

288
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,630
Yeah.

289
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,440
So if you get some dudes coming out of
Jamaica or France or Spain or whatever,

290
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:52,640
and they just burst onto the scene,

291
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,010
they start fucking running fascinated.

292
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,853
But who else?

293
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,840
They're doing some shit
that no one knows about it.

294
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:59,150
I know a woman is going to
compete for our country.

295
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,470
How bigs or did it happen that she had it?

296
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,343
She had a dick on it,

297
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,780
but the steroids didn't him.

298
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,480
But she was at trend to be a
triathlete and she was quite,

299
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,081
she was American,

300
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:11,010
but she was going to represent
the country of her art.

301
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,080
And I started training and she was
phenomenal athlete and everything else.

302
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,280
And her coach said,

303
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,114
so,

304
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,570
uh,

305
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,690
now of course we got to talk
about getting to the next level.

306
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,260
Whoa.

307
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,190
And she goes,

308
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,001
I'm a triathlete,

309
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:23,460
which I wanted.

310
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,070
I said,

311
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,600
we gotta,

312
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,230
we gotta start talking about messing
with your endocrine system because you're

313
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,920
not gonna,

314
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,200
you're not gonna get these times until we,

315
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,621
it came,

316
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,454
we compete.

317
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,130
And He,

318
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:32,480
and she,

319
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,180
and then when she saw that everybody,

320
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:34,730
and he's like,

321
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:34,911
well,

322
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,390
none of them,

323
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,101
he's famous coach.

324
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:37,150
He's like this,

325
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,720
this is just a reality.

326
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,681
She was like,

327
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:39,861
God,

328
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,730
that's what she's doing.

329
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,923
She didn't do it.

330
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,580
I would the Lance Armstrong story,

331
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,710
like Lance Armstrong realized when he
was young that everybody is doing drugs,

332
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:49,940
all of them.

333
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,320
And so he who competed clean when he was
young until he got to a certain level

334
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:54,681
and he's like,

335
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:55,460
fuck,

336
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,320
like this is just how
this goddamn thing works.

337
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,154
It's just this week,

338
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,850
three card Monte game of
hiding your dirty piss.

339
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,390
And he was better than everybody
has that a bad guy state sponsored?

340
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,690
Yeah.

341
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,620
It's just part of the game.

342
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:06,840
What,

343
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,673
what do you think?

344
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,031
Like,

345
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:08,221
so,

346
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,800
so my feeling is,

347
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,850
uh,

348
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,211
like so,

349
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:14,240
so if weightlifters are gonna
move world record weights,

350
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,390
it's really exciting to see them do that.

351
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,210
And obviously it power lifters
and stuff like that are,

352
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,880
are not going to be lifting
as much with testosterone.

353
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,170
My question is,

354
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,440
are we ever going to be beat like
the inexorable advance of technology.

355
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,260
Are we ever going to really be able to
start as we are able to gene dope and all

356
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:33,801
that stuff.

357
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,070
Like where are we going with this and
and is always going can be a cat and

358
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:37,350
mouse.

359
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,980
Can we gonna yeah.

360
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,190
Are we going to police this?

361
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:41,290
Know everyone's always going
to look for an edge always.

362
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,260
But in powerlifting,

363
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:42,651
yeah.

364
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:45,650
I don't give a fuck what they
do cause the power lifting,

365
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,310
you know?

366
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,690
So when it comes to fighting,

367
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:48,511
fighting football,

368
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:49,130
number one.

369
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:49,311
Yeah,

370
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:50,144
those are the two.

371
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,030
Number one fuck f for sure.

372
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,050
Football and fighting because
you're hitting on is too.

373
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,983
Yeah.

374
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,500
Football's a combat sport.

375
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,100
It's just got rigid rules when you're
running full clip at each other and

376
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:04,710
literally like knocking each other
unconscious cause your head butting each

377
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:04,891
other.

378
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:05,280
Yeah.

379
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,050
I mean which is baseball.

380
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,230
You don't,

381
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,120
a big part of football was until
they stop people doing that.

382
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,420
Yeah.

383
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,380
It's a combat sport.

384
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,750
100% it just doesn't
have kicks or punches.

385
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,330
But the juice is worth
the squeeze and football.

386
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
It's worth the squeeze financially,

387
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,121
financially,

388
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,931
educationally.

389
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:19,980
There's the same.

390
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:20,430
There's,

391
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,310
how about baseball where your
bat speed stays the same?

392
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,490
No,

393
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,281
I don't give a fuck.

394
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,880
Hit all the home runs you want baseball.

395
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,170
Baseball is,

396
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:31,310
it's a good argument for steroids
because it's a boring fucking game too.

397
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:31,831
And then you're awesome.

398
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:33,390
It's fun was when someone hits that ball.

399
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,141
When was it fun?

400
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:34,921
When Jose can say,

401
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:39,450
come on Barry Bonds and mark McGwire
that cracking them out of the park.

402
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,350
That's when it's fun.

403
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,060
And I don't like that.

404
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,880
You get there,

405
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,760
you're playing 160 games and
you break down to the season.

406
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,200
Peeps.

407
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,300
You too many gay Siri.

408
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:48,040
Too many games.

409
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,960
Simply too many games.

410
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:49,260
Yeah.

411
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,020
If you're sprinting full
out all the time like that,

412
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:53,070
trying to get to third base.

413
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:53,310
Yeah.

414
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,730
There's so many times where you're
doing damage to your body and you're not

415
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:57,810
going to have a chance to recover.

416
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah.

417
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,280
But if you're on the Jews
who couldn't run faster,

418
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,270
you can keep go.

419
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:03,990
So what do you think?

420
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,450
But it's weird with the MLB
how they cracked down on it,

421
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:07,080
right?

422
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,980
They're killing it now,

423
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,060
but the same with UFC,

424
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:10,200
like they cracked down on it,

425
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,920
so now you have Usada but then you're
not getting as good as the product that I

426
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:16,140
don't think there's anything wrong with
the product right there on the UFC.

427
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,430
I think it's as good as it's ever been.

428
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:18,420
But how dare you?

429
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,570
I did a few fighters
have dropped off the map,

430
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,110
but I think that's probably a good thing
because I think those guys are probably

431
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:25,770
agregious.

432
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,191
I'd see.

433
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:27,060
I think it's a combination.

434
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,610
I think the skill level's
going up just naturally,

435
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,941
you know,

436
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:31,560
through evolution skill is going up,

437
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,390
but when you have such strict testing,

438
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,990
then we're missing out on certain guys
like John Jones and these other guys.

439
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,171
Well,

440
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:40,200
the John John's wants is very
unfortunate because John is just

441
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,250
just one of the most
talented guys of all time,

442
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:45,390
if not the most talented.

443
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:49,980
He's number one and also the biggest
disaster in terms of the big mistakes that

444
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:50,341
he's made.

445
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:50,491
Like,

446
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:50,631
dude,

447
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:54,060
we've never had a fighter that did a hit
and run on a pregnant woman and broke

448
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:58,830
her arm and then took off and then test
positive for drugs because he's on Dick

449
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,060
Pills and then test positive again after
his comeback after a spectacular went

450
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:03,840
over Daniel Cormier.

451
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,850
And he's so disappointed in that regard.

452
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,370
So exceptional in his physical abilities,

453
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:08,940
but the dis,

454
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,120
the choices he makes and the decisions
that come out of those choices.

455
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:14,340
So just fucking terrible.

456
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,260
But a lot of it's because of the strict
testing that the UFC hired you guys

457
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,650
decide to do with the car accident.

458
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,300
That has nothing to do
with the car accident,

459
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,520
but so like Klaxon yes,

460
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,030
but yeah,

461
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,750
now,

462
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,141
yes,

463
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:25,471
he'd be,

464
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:26,271
he'd be cleared,

465
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:26,970
he'd be all good.

466
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,301
Yes.

467
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:27,720
But it's,

468
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,540
there's a symptom is a symptom
of something else going on.

469
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,140
You know,

470
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,660
and people don't like to discuss this,

471
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,430
but one of the things that easily could
be is that John has impulse control

472
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:43,431
because he's been sparring and fighting
and at the highest level of the sport

473
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,341
for many,

474
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:45,270
many years now.

475
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,030
And he's gotten hit in
the head of gang of times.

476
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,510
There's no,

477
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,321
there's no way around it.

478
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:53,130
There was just an article I posted on
Twitter that came out a couple of days ago

479
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,490
that these neuroscientists

480
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,380
we're examining um,

481
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,470
brain injury and violent behavior and
like how they're connected and how damaged

482
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,950
to certain areas of the brain has
irreparable consequences on the decision

483
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:06,530
making ability.

484
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,330
The person who gets hit,

485
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,220
I think that's part of it,

486
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:08,630
but also,

487
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:08,921
you know,

488
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:11,050
he's been wild since high wild college,

489
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,780
which is the why.

490
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,311
So dude,

491
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,450
that's why he's a fucking,

492
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,830
one of the reasons why you is because
he's a wild motherfucker and I loved that

493
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:18,100
part.

494
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,180
Connor's a little while too.

495
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,033
He's wild,

496
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,570
wild like you lit call
masterminds of this game.

497
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,150
They're all little wild
man to be 80 sport though.

498
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:26,391
Look at,

499
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:30,000
look at Cam Newton prior looking
at some of the greatest fighters.

500
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,910
Wait,

501
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,480
if Francis Ghana,

502
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,570
Colin's the world championship and
spreads those super power genes throughout

503
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,130
this great nation of ours.

504
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,920
Okay,

505
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,960
we won't need steroids.

506
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,060
Go and goes.

507
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,290
You're having a champion of the world.

508
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,190
Take a little bump here of
this guy's Francis kids.

509
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,831
Part of that.

510
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:49,720
Maybe he doesn't want
the devil's Dandruff.

511
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,420
See all fuck steep aimia
the sitch he's gotta get,

512
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,810
he's got to stop sleep bay from double
or single leg and him taking him to the

513
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,160
ground and riding them.

514
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,390
So you guys be careful cause I'm saying
Steve Bay is gonna wrestle him to the

515
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:01,830
ground.

516
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,300
I love hiring sincere.

517
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,480
Brian Count comes out brand council.

518
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,880
I don't know what the tire him out and
then he's going to stand them up in the

519
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:10,211
third,

520
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,430
fourth round and all that
stress is going to go away.

521
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,530
Well it's entirely possible
as Steve Bay winds,

522
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,350
this Dbas the world heavyweight champions,

523
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,550
tpa beaten junior dos Santos by knockout.

524
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,870
He beat a Orlowski by knockout.

525
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,420
He beat Overeem by knocking that.

526
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:23,080
He's,

527
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,640
he's a bad motherfucker.

528
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:27,160
He won the title with a
one punch falling away.

529
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,450
Right hand on the button.

530
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:29,530
He's a bad motherfucker.

531
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,410
No doubt about it.

532
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,050
But there's,

533
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,140
there's physical undeniable
characteristics that in
Ghana who possesses that

534
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,730
make him the most
terrifying guy in the sport.

535
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,570
But we haven't.

536
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,260
The only,

537
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,620
the only shot that them seeing what
Steve Bay when this fight though is

538
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:48,040
stylistically he could be
the Achilles heel to Francis.

539
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,170
Meaning he doesn't entertain the standup.

540
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:53,560
He just puts that fucking forehead
in the middle of his chest as I,

541
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:53,891
dude,

542
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:55,360
we're riding this out till the third,

543
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:55,811
fourth round.

544
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:56,910
Let's see what you can do here.

545
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,210
It's totally possible.

546
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,920
But Alster when he clinched up with them,

547
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:04,000
Allister is fucking huge and to clenched
up with within Ghana and it was like

548
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,380
trying to bear hug a wall.

549
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,243
You see his face,

550
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,160
he liked red state and then when he
gets flipped around and he's like,

551
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,480
Oh shit,

552
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,520
that's not snowflake.

553
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,603
That's not snowflake.

554
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,660
And then just get the ceiling
on the co five four rounds,

555
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,733
three rounds.

556
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,620
No,

557
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:18,790
no.

558
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,300
I think the most he's ever been as to,

559
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,620
he got taken out in his first
fight against the Curtis blades.

560
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,760
You shouldn't hang your head on that
because Curtis blades with a Juco,

561
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:28,900
national champion Juco,

562
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,770
national chancellor.

563
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,990
Fucking good recipe.

564
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,760
But she's an excellent athlete too and
he keeps getting better and better.

565
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:34,421
Curtis Blades,

566
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:35,680
a real dark horse in the sport.

567
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,940
I really think that 10 now,

568
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,550
if he keeps improving and
keeps working at the radius,

569
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:40,600
he's a big guy.

570
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:41,530
He hits hard,

571
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,040
fucking aggressive and
smart standups has got,

572
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,660
hopefully it's working with Christian
Alan out there and tell her I'll,

573
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,910
his standup's kind of is.

574
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,370
It's US getting better at getting better.

575
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,410
He's getting at it.

576
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:53,600
But the thing is he's
got a lot to work with.

577
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,650
Like he's,

578
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,150
yeah,

579
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,340
he's got a lot to work
with and he's a young guy.

580
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,930
Look at the Juco national champs.

581
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:00,764
He was like,

582
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,191
well,

583
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,750
so is he looks a 74,

584
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,170
but how old is he?

585
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,200
John is Juco national champions.

586
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,680
Anthony Rumble Johnson June.

587
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:08,230
That's June.

588
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:08,910
Yeah.

589
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,500
Um,

590
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,580
well this is a lot of guys.

591
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,300
He Won.

592
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,070
He was [inaudible] stairs.

593
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,151
Uh,

594
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:14,571
I think so.

595
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:15,350
I'm played baseball.

596
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,060
There's a lot of guys
were phenomenal athletes.

597
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:19,520
It never wind up going to a big college
just because they don't have the

598
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,410
athletic or maybe we go financial.

599
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,140
Curtis blades has a,

600
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,240
he has a lot of potential.

601
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:26,541
Dude,

602
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,700
he has a lot of potential
and he's only 26.

603
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:29,870
I think in Ghana it was what,

604
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,980
33 32 33 how old's France?

605
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,950
Not a young chicken,

606
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,310
but he had some rough years fighting
on the streets and camera room.

607
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah.

608
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,170
31 31 so in Ghana is 31 so think
about Curtis plays in five years.

609
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,343
Think about it.

610
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,211
He keeps getting better.

611
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,450
Five years ago we didn't
even know who I am.

612
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:45,621
Gone.

613
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:46,670
I was two years ago.

614
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:47,750
He makes his UFC debut.

615
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,591
Two years later,

616
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:52,150
everybody's lying on their back and he's
fighting for the title and I called him

617
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,170
to check Congo with braids
and I want to apologize.

618
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,300
He doesn't appraise anymore.

619
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,190
Now he's got fired.

620
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,260
It's all jives for that.

621
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,970
Now he's going to start highlighted tips.

622
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,580
Nobody says a word about it and not a,

623
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,360
not a word dude.

624
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,330
I saw him in the first few weeks he
had been through since I retired.

625
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,860
I went to that UFC that we at in Vegas
and there I was around the fighters and

626
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:11,440
all that and there was one hot dog left,

627
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,880
went to grab the hot dog and
he reached for the hot dog.

628
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,870
He fucking deboned me on a hot day.

629
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,980
Like even out of the Bro.

630
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,790
It's fucking huge.

631
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,590
He's scared.

632
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,430
Nicest guy though.

633
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,900
He's a very nice guy.

634
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,853
Very nice guy.

635
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,940
So I think that,

636
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,510
you know,

637
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,560
Steve Bay is,

638
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,640
you have to say that Steve
Bay is the most experience.

639
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,670
Steve Bay has real wins over worldclass
competition other than Allister and our

640
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,330
Lawsky who are the two
guys that in Gando fought.

641
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,470
So he's gotten more experienced,

642
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:40,610
haven't been Verdomme,

643
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,930
haven't beating,

644
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,950
having beaten,

645
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,490
you know,

646
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,420
top flight guys,

647
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:48,740
junior dos Santos by chaos arena
style to though he's got a chance.

648
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,490
Yeah.

649
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,080
I mean if he does have to makers have
him as it as a disadvantage and I Steve

650
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,100
Bay.

651
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,290
Yeah.

652
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:54,501
Yeah.

653
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:55,190
He's an underdog.

654
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:55,431
Yeah.

655
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,240
I watched that.

656
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,250
That upper cut that he
hit with a v Overeem,

657
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,950
Overeem him,

658
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,460
please don't,

659
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,900
I watched her teeth full.

660
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,480
Like I washed it in full speed.

661
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:06,314
Full speed.

662
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,660
So fast it like in real time,

663
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,530
it's so fast.

664
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,850
It's so much faster than you realize.

665
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:11,940
Depending on the angle you look at it.

666
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,380
What was,

667
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,840

668
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,733
I

669
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,430
watch it.

670
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,330
Couldn't get hit by him.

671
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:19,190
So he was trying to be wild in over him.

672
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:19,780
Just wet,

673
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,150
wet.

674
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,640
Oh yeah.

675
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:20,950
Mom,

676
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,790
the greatest strikers and the
heavyweight division all the time.

677
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,660
Fuck it.

678
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,260
But Watch how fast it goes and we have it.

679
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:27,981

681
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,200
Crazy fast.

682
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,910
Like a weird shootout with over him.

683
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:32,990
Just be like all the experience.

684
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:33,210
Be like,

685
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,030

can win the first round?

686
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,961
Fuck it.

687
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:37,110
Let's just throw from her hip.

688
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:38,120
See what happens.

689
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,570
I know like why didn't you like
kick his legs on the outside?

690
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:44,600
It's watch how fast this is.

691
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:45,434
What?

692
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:46,820
See Look,

693
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:46,971

694
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:47,840
go to Allister is doing,

695
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:49,300
he's just trying to be like real awkward.

696
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,650
You said this was at the gala.

697
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:51,990
He said that.

698
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,823
Yeah.

699
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,680
What was the game plan?

700
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,730
Not this.

701
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,923
Oh,

702
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,800
such a hard left hook to God knock out.

703
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,110
You know what that's like?

704
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,420
That's like a bone crusher.

705
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:04,470
Smith Shovel Hook.

706
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,340
And when bone crusher Smith used to
have that ridiculous lefthand and it was

707
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:09,480
like a half hug,

708
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,991
half upper cut.

709
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:11,130
That was just a shovel man.

710
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,450
Terrifying.

711
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,360
And then when you find out his dad was
a legendary street fighter in Cameroon,

712
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:18,010
you like,

713
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:18,370
oh,

714
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,203
okay.

715
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,240
That was legendary.

716
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:21,780
Oh.

717
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,430
And then he was homeless five years ago,

718
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,391
five years ago.

719
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,350
Just did that stuff.

720
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:25,621
Oh,

721
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:26,880
you mean the movie Lionheart yeah,

722
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:27,714
that's fucking him.

723
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,490
And all he does is train man.

724
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,970
All he does his training practically
lives at the UFC performance institute.

725
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:33,301
Really?

726
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:34,111
He's there every day.

727
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,140
He's dfcs bank.

728
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,180
Do you have cs performance institute is
the most state of the art motherfucking

729
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,300
place you've ever seen your life is terms
of recovery in terms of strength and

730
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:43,110
conditioning equipment.

731
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,280
I mean it is a fucking spectacular
and he just lives there.

732
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,250
He's there every day.

733
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,083
They moved him there.

734
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,720
Yeah,

735
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,050
they moved him from France to Vegas.

736
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,140
His trainers there.

737
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,070
Well he,

738
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,240
Vinnie Magallanes I know is working
with them in terms of his Jujitsu,

739
00:18:57,241 --> 00:19:00,810
but his original trainer that found
him in Paris is with him here.

740
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:01,920
I forget the gentleman's name,

741
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,960
but this is the UFC performance institute.

742
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,150
It's fucking phenomenal.

743
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:06,930
Is My thing with this Joe crazy.

744
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:07,650
So let's say,

745
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,251
so France,

746
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:09,170
they're doing his camp left.

747
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:09,571
Steve Bates,

748
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:10,081
I came in,

749
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:10,651
I want those.

750
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,640
I'm gonna do my camp there too.

751
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,281
It's a good point.

752
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:13,200
And Steve Bay as a champ,

753
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,610
but so what they do,

754
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,520
luckily,

755
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,470
you know it's not an issue because Steve
Bay is in Cleveland and he has his same

756
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:22,550
coaches that he's always had and a real
tight knit team that's working on a

757
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:23,030
farm.

758
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,060
I'm saying at some point,

759
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:24,710
let's say,

760
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,543
let's say,

761
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,270
where's that girl a full makeup on.

762
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:28,060
What's she's throwing punches.

763
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,260
Easy,

764
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,330
hottest girl ever enter the octagon.

765
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,920

766
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,970

767
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,470
I got nothing for it,

768
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:35,940
but I don't know about that man.

769
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,020
You think she's hotter than that?

770
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:37,591
Rachel,

771
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:38,240
how do you see her name?

772
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,860
Asta Vic girl that just fought for the,

773
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,370
uh,

774
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,203
the ultimate,

775
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,790
let me say the ultimate
fighter TV show with that.

776
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,770
You're talking about the two
old biddies I'm talking about.

777
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:46,921
Yeah,

778
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:47,754
the girl from Hawaii.

779
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:47,941
Oh,

780
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:48,271
dark,

781
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,090
dark hair.

782
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,750
See this down long.

783
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,920
She's sustained.

784
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,800
One bounced on rooting for just
to see if you can find her.

785
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:58,540
We were one of the shitty viewers for.

786
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,560
She's way more,

787
00:19:59,560 --> 00:19:59,700
well,

788
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,200
I don't want say the girls ugly girls.

789
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:01,861
Definitely not ugly.

790
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:02,491
She's very pretty.

791
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:02,941
But first of all,

792
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:03,660
why she wearing makeup?

793
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,493
I she's fighting.

794
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:04,900
Yeah.

795
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,740
Well as well as was a commercial I
scare of both models and that was a

796
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:09,780
commercial engineer.

797
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,440
That commercial,

798
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,930
they show some sort of Santa Monica lab,

799
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,320
say bunch of Melvin millennials that have
a hard time putting their backpack in

800
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:17,220
the overhead compartment.

801
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,553
I thought that was,

802
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,220
that was surveillance gyms around.

803
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,460
Yeah.

804
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,960
See,

805
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,640
shut your fucking mouth.

806
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,313
Look at,

807
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,580
that's what I'm talking about.

808
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:27,690
That kind of body flush.

809
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,900
Jesus dude.

810
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,660
Hey,

811
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,381
I can't watch this.

812
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:32,214
I'm going to pass out.

813
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
They keep this going Jamie.

814
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,970
But then she could fight too.

815
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:36,250
I mean,

816
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,410
I don't want to be disrespect.

817
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:38,244
She can fight.

818
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,231
She's legit.

819
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:41,011
She's gorgeous.

820
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:41,330
Yeah.

821
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,710
And you know by all accounts,

822
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,573
very nice person.

823
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,650
So there's a lot of
pretty girls back then.

824
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,070
There's

825
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,950
a lot of pretty girls that are finding
their way into the UFC and they find that

826
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,210
like that's an asset.

827
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:55,390
You know what's really interesting to
me from one of the best looking ones of

828
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,390
all puts zero emphasis on that.

829
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,021
And that's rose.

830
00:20:59,021 --> 00:20:59,650
Nama Eunice.

831
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,200
I know rose is of course she's gorgeous.

832
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,213
She's pretty,

833
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,061
she's pretty.

834
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,830
And she puts no emphasis on that.

835
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,000
Shaves her fucking head.

836
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:07,834
I know.

837
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,460
There's nothing fake about that.

838
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,673
She's just,

839
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,220
there's nothing fake about that girl.

840
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,411
Yeah,

841
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:14,861
we met her,

842
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:15,371
I think our,

843
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:16,120
at least I did.

844
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,210
You'd known her before I met her.

845
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,300
I think that thing we did,

846
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:20,230
was it a spike thing?

847
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:21,130
I remember UFC thing.

848
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:22,960
It was at and she was in a dress shoes.

849
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:23,561
The Pat Barry.

850
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:24,250
Yeah.

851
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:24,970
And she,

852
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,140
but she had long hair back then.

853
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,210
I mean she was stunning,

854
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:30,820
like astonishing looking and I
didn't know she was at the time.

855
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,870
And uh,

856
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,230
I mean,

857
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,741
so she,

858
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:32,951
yeah,

859
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:33,490
she's,

860
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,060
she's,

861
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,940
if she walked into a bar
back then like that even now,

862
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,470
but I mean back then you
would have been like,

863
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:38,741
I mean,

864
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:41,140
she turns out as a supermodel failure.

865
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,051
She really doesn't,

866
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:42,410
she doesn't,

867
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,580
she's a model and she doesn't
put any emphasis on that at all.

868
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:49,110
All of our emphasis is on our
fighting and zero trash-talking.

869
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,520
When she shaved her head,

870
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,393
the fight,

871
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,590
she stated her head when she
was fighting Paige vanzant.

872
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:54,040
She went,

873
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,251
oh,

874
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:55,180
you're things beauty.

875
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,950
She's like,

876
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,030
my hair was just getting in the way.

877
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:58,864
Fuck it.

878
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,780
Then beat the brakes off of.

879
00:21:59,790 --> 00:21:59,921
Yeah,

880
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:00,850
that's what she needs to look like.

881
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:01,271
She's tough.

882
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:02,800
Like that's like workout here.

883
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
She looks better with her head.

884
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:05,800
Shaved I

885
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,550
corner with the right red shirt on there.

886
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,290
Jamie upper right hand corner right there.

887
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,850
I mean shut the fuck up.

888
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,290
That's a beautiful girl.

889
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,710
That's a model that is about as hot is
a woman's face gets w contract for God's

890
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:21,280
sake.

891
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,880
Meanwhile,

892
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,210
how the fuck did no one see
her coming hot mean it's,

893
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,700
it's kinda crazy how
because she was so feminine.

894
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,140
I think she doesn't like her body.

895
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,880
No.

896
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,570
Let me think about how much emphasis
they put on promoting Paige vanzant how

897
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:37,510
much emphasis they put on a lot of
other girls that are really pretty too,

898
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:37,961
but that's,

899
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:39,160
that's a marketing thing.

900
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:39,570
Look,

901
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,010
you got to look at like
what this company is now.

902
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,430
Right?

903
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,420
This company started off a passion
project by two fucking crazy billionaire

904
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:46,690
dudes.

905
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:46,871
Well,

906
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:47,500
first of all,

907
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,430
Horian Gracie,

908
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:48,941
right?

909
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:49,571
Art Davies,

910
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:50,590
the original guys,

911
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,180
uh,

912
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,130
you know Meyrowitz those
guys who started it off,

913
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,060
they get it going.

914
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:58,030
Then they sell it as a passion project to,

915
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:00,760
to Super Billionaires who love the sport,

916
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,893
who train.

917
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,450
They were fucking like happy
as pie and they're like,

918
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:04,750
wait,

919
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,740
we own the UFC.

920
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:06,970
Dana talked him into it.

921
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:07,330
Yeah,

922
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,163
didn't talk to me.

923
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,570
They're having a good old time.

924
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,050
They literally were what me and
Eddie Bravo used to pray for.

925
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,830
We s when we were watching the fights
back when nobody gave a shit about the UFC

926
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,570
thing we always said was,

927
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,100
wouldn't it be amazing
if some billionaires just
through a shitload of money at

928
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:25,060
it and made it famous?

929
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:27,730
Like we know it's an an
incredible sport to watch.

930
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,140
We know how exciting it is.

931
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,830
Wouldn't it be great if someone had
just publicize this thing and then the

932
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:34,840
Fertittas come along
literally like they just,

933
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,580
they figured it out themselves.

934
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:36,851
They're like,

935
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:37,810
this thing is like,

936
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,190
we just need to spend money.

937
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,910
They spent,

938
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,470
they were $40 million in the hole when
the first ultimate fighter was Erin.

939
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:44,621
Oh.

940
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:45,830
So they put that much money into it,

941
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,260
produce the ultimate fighter.

942
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,250
Lorenzo's a genius.

943
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,350
And then the show takes off the shot.

944
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,131
And this is by the way,

945
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,980
after they had called Dana
White and told him to bail,

946
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,180
they like sell this thing,

947
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,320
we're losing too much money.

948
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:57,890
We were,

949
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,191
you know,

950
00:23:58,191 --> 00:23:59,720
x amount of millions
of dollars in the hole.

951
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:03,410
I'm not going to lose my family's business
all because of this one project that

952
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:03,681
we have.

953
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:04,514
Fuck this.

954
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,020
And then he calls him up
the next day and he goes,

955
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:06,861
I changed from,

956
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:11,861
he slept on it because he's
a fucking genius I think.

957
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,340
I think Lorenzo's the most,

958
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:14,720
you know,

959
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,890
there's one a one B,

960
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:19,210
but he's right up there as most important
people and he's so calm history.

961
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:19,670
He was the,

962
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,090
he was an important like
balancing act to Dana Dana.

963
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:27,920
So volatile and crazy emotional guy
and he's a faggot and this and all the

964
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:28,630
craziness of the day.

965
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,380
And especially in the
early days used to be.

966
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,770
And then he goes from that to super calm,

967
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,910
really reasonable,

968
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:36,020
incredibly articulate,

969
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,970
like laid back Lorenzo,

970
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:38,691
I think.

971
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:39,860
I think he's missed now.

972
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,110
Now.

973
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,150
Now that things are going on.

974
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:43,730
Like you would never seen
the Floyd Mayweather,

975
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,660
Conor fight if Lorenza was there because
he that he would've never let that

976
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:48,494
happen.

977
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,150
He really wasn't into that stuff.

978
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,140
He really wasn't man.

979
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,361
Oh,

980
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:51,980
you're crazy.

981
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,870
I don't think I like,

982
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,930
he didn't like spectacle.

983
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,570
No,

984
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,150
but why would you pass on that thing?

985
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,110
I wanted to see that.

986
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:57,950
Didn't you want to see that?

987
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,760
Cellie?

988
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,600
I wanted to see it.

989
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,440
I wanted to see it.

990
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:03,770
But Lorenzo I think looked at the bigger
picture because I think now that we

991
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:07,310
look back on Floyd and and Connor
and then where the UFC at now,

992
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,930
I don't know if was the best decision.

993
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,010
It's a great decision.

994
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,600
I think it was an amazing decision.

995
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:11,961
First of all,

996
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:15,860
it's an amazing decision for the
overall evolution of combat sports.

997
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,450
It's incredibly important.

998
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,320
No chance.

999
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,150
It's incredibly important to realize
that a real specialist like Floyd

1000
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,800
Mayweather will run circles around someone
who does not have the same amount of

1001
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:29,300
time and knowledge.

1002
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,400
Like Connor has great punching power,

1003
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,750
he's got great speed.

1004
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,370
But as far as his like boxing acumen to
compare the two of them the greatest of

1005
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,120
all time,

1006
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,953
arguably no,

1007
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,590
there's no,

1008
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,930
there's no,

1009
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,763
there's no event.

1010
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,260
Please caveat that with the fact that
Floyd Mayweather didn't even fight him the

1011
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:46,310
way he fights other guys.

1012
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,810
If you'd want it not to be touched,

1013
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:48,644
he could have done that.

1014
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,920
You disagree with that towards some made
him work hard and I don't think it wore

1015
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:52,754
him out.

1016
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,620
And that's great.

1017
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,490
And those are great points.

1018
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:58,520
But I think if you look at the
lay of the lay of the land now,

1019
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,640
Lorenza wouldn't have done it because
now you have two divisions held up.

1020
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,950
You have Connor with all this power.

1021
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,360
We have no idea what he's going to fight.

1022
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,620
He didn't ever have to fight again.

1023
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,910
So he missed out on Connor.

1024
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,410
If you want to sell the TV deals,

1025
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,090
you can't guarantee Connor's gonna fight.

1026
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,290
That's why Lorenza and is a thing there.

1027
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,710
Go ahead.

1028
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:20,710
Also also now we're in the era of the
money fight where everyone wants the money

1029
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:22,250
for rankings.

1030
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:22,700
Don't matter.

1031
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,600
Divisions don't matter.

1032
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,710
Titles don't matter,

1033
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,190
so we've lost all that kind of the,

1034
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,750
the the fundamental that we've laid out.

1035
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,890
No title shots and all.

1036
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:31,600
I disagree.

1037
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,320
I think now everyone
wants to famous fight.

1038
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,450
I'll do want the famous fighters.

1039
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,303
Here's the money.

1040
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:36,980
Hold on a second.

1041
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,813
This is not,

1042
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,650
we haven't lost all the rankings.

1043
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,780
We just lost a ranking sometimes.

1044
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,410
Sometimes they don't matter.

1045
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,580
Listen,

1046
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,030
this is a lot of it is because the
$4 billion price tag of that company,

1047
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,830
that's a big part of it.

1048
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,720
Well a lot of us cause the fighters,

1049
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,690
I don't want your money because
the people that own the fight,

1050
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:51,960
the,

1051
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,180
the company now or an
entertainment business were like,

1052
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:54,900
where's the money?

1053
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,640
The money's in these big spectacle things.

1054
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:57,450
That's where the money is.

1055
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,283
We're here to make some money.

1056
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,580
We're here to put on great fights.

1057
00:26:59,730 --> 00:26:59,941
Like,

1058
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:02,820
you can't tell me that fucking Detroit
card was one of the wildest fight cards

1059
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,200
you've ever seen in
your life and put it on,

1060
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,750
put on great fucking fights.

1061
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,070
They're putting on great cards.

1062
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,270
And on top of that,

1063
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,310
they're also having chaos.

1064
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,290
They're having Conor McGregor box,

1065
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:14,124
Floyd Mayweather.

1066
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,220
But I think for the
evolution of combat sports,

1067
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:17,490
that fight is important.

1068
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:18,001
How do they,

1069
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:21,830
I don't think it lended itself to the
evolution of combat sports in that there

1070
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:24,200
was such different sports so that I,

1071
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:27,630
I think everybody would knew that
ultimately we need to see it.

1072
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,370
Yes.

1073
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:28,861
Like James,

1074
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:30,590
Tony [inaudible],

1075
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,650
Tony or Randy couture fight is not fair
because James Tony halfassed that he

1076
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:35,550
barely trained,

1077
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,050
he didn't train any grappling.

1078
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,730
We saw him doing his training with
some karate guy and he was like,

1079
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,780
we did this stuff to,

1080
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,000
even with the milky.

1081
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,913
Yeah.

1082
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,400
But,

1083
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,090
but here's the thing with James Tony
did was try to just go in there and get

1084
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:48,660
paid.

1085
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,030
He got taken down with a low ankle pick.

1086
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,490
He got to completely smashed by.

1087
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:54,630
Really built as a temp.

1088
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,350
I agree.

1089
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,220
He's out of shape.

1090
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,600
He was.

1091
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,360
He's way past prime where
theirs is fucking prime.

1092
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:03,260
Even though he's 40 he's still so good.

1093
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,153
His prime,

1094
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,310
he's lost a step.

1095
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,630
You can't say he's lost a step.

1096
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,670
You look at him against me.

1097
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:11,310
Tell me a 26 year old Floyd mailing
eats that up cut coming landed on him.

1098
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,650
If he fought that way it's a pen.

1099
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,770
If you tried to just walk towards
him like he had nothing he did,

1100
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:17,780
he stood in his garage,

1101
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,090
kind of cracked him with that one
shot and I think Floyd was like,

1102
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,600
oh okay,

1103
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,050
okay,

1104
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,291
okay,

1105
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,090
you can hit me.

1106
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,401
He's like,

1107
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,234
we had to get going on.

1108
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,601
Well let me,

1109
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:29,460
let me just start ramping this bitch
up to nine quizzing you a little bit.

1110
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,720
I think you in May whether on Conor
McGregor stuff more than anyone and I love

1111
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:34,710
it cause comedy got paid.

1112
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,560
I'm saying Lorenza from a
business aspect is going,

1113
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,910
if we give all this guy the fucking
power now the ball's in his court,

1114
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:42,121
man,

1115
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:42,280
that's,

1116
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,260
that's not what we're about.

1117
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:45,630
That's what my thoughts and
now everyone else's fault,

1118
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,460
you get a superstar.

1119
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,960
The only way you get a sugar ray Leonard,

1120
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,241
uh,

1121
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:54,241
Muhammad Ali don't dose th th th the cult
of personality that comes around those

1122
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:54,620
people,

1123
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,160
they do have all the power.

1124
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,150
There's no getting away.

1125
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,611
They do.

1126
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:57,991
You can't,

1127
00:28:57,991 --> 00:29:00,270
you can't stop that as a
promotional organization.

1128
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:04,770
You have to somehow or another ride with
the wave and make some sort of cohesive

1129
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:04,950
way,

1130
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,880
may also want to be checked.

1131
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,580
Got To make some side of
agreement with that person.

1132
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,463
Yeah,

1133
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,400
I made it with Brock Lesnar.

1134
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,570
They may deal with Ronda Rousey,

1135
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:15,270
the other really the only
other two superstars.

1136
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,313
But they did it.

1137
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,850
They didn't last because
when see what keeps him,

1138
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,120
uh,

1139
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,953
uh,

1140
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,540
a champion relevant and,

1141
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,760
and in the lure is,

1142
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,640
is the guy who keeps answering the call.

1143
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,140
And,

1144
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,820
and Connor did that in two
different weight classes.

1145
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:30,271
I mean I,

1146
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:30,541
you know,

1147
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:30,921
he,

1148
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:34,680
he beat the impossible
to be and then people,

1149
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,990
cause he hasn't defended a bite
and what he's done is that,

1150
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:38,791
that's what I'm saying.

1151
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:40,860
That's why I agree with your point
about the evolution of the combat.

1152
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,600
What it's done now is put
so much power in his hands.

1153
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:43,811
He's a,

1154
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:44,860
he's got $100 million,

1155
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,140
whatever.

1156
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,020
It happens to me too,

1157
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:47,771
cause I liked the guy,

1158
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:49,990
but at the same time like it's,

1159
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,160
you're not going to see him.

1160
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:56,161
You're not going to see him fight d
these monsters like Tony [inaudible] Tony

1161
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:58,714
this year.

1162
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,480
Why would you say that he,

1163
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,120
first of all,

1164
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,910
I don't like anybody saying this guy's
not going to do this or he's not going to

1165
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:04,990
do that because we really don't know.

1166
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,350
But why wouldn't he fight Tony
Ferguson if he wants to fight a guy?

1167
00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:10,120
I haven't seen him even training.

1168
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:10,620
I don't know.

1169
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,850
Straight nonstop.

1170
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,650
Do you fall on its wrong Brian now,

1171
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,873
but you're going to fight.

1172
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,580
He hasn't come to my house.

1173
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:20,490
She hasn't been training in Santa
Monica and that's the right way.

1174
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,460
Where are you going to sand tray?

1175
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,230
What I'm saying is I
didn't mentioned fighting

1176
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,710
each other back and fight back and forth.

1177
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,501
She goes,

1178
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:29,741
Hey,

1179
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:30,730
are you going to box pack yet?

1180
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:30,911
He goes,

1181
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:31,031
no,

1182
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,620
my next fight is mixed martial arts.

1183
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,940
I'm going to find inside that octagon.

1184
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,091
Yeah.

1185
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:35,590
He said to my next one is
going to be a real fight.

1186
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,530
Nobody's going to fight 20 freaks
and that Tony freaks and fight.

1187
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,920
When I,

1188
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
when I look at it more and more,

1189
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,754
I watch footage.

1190
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,740
I think it's,

1191
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,880
it's not that bad of a matchup
or Carla used to be like,

1192
00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:44,021
God,

1193
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:44,854
that's a tough fight.

1194
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,110
But I think early on,

1195
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,290
especially early rounds,

1196
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:49,870
one through three with
Connors accuracy and the,

1197
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:51,100
and the way Tony gets hit,

1198
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,030
it's a good fight for cares
to past the third round.

1199
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:56,770
It could get to parts of problem.

1200
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,260
One Tony Finishes
motherfuckers off his back.

1201
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,960
He is nasty off his back
if he can come down.

1202
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,680
Yeah.

1203
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,491
If he gets taken down,

1204
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:04,870
it doesn't mean I'm saying if he gets hit,

1205
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,010
if he gets hit like Nate Diaz does
and goes down like Connor is not,

1206
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:11,800
it's not like 100% that he's going to
beat him up and ground and pound them.

1207
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,190
Tony,

1208
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,210
if he gets dropped,

1209
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,000
we'll wrap you up like a
fucking mummy and submit you.

1210
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:16,990
So we can do though.

1211
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:17,371
And Connor,

1212
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:18,370
does it entertain that?

1213
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,740
Maybe Nate?

1214
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,830
Eh,

1215
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,110
you know what?

1216
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,060
I'm saying like you don't,

1217
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,220
and they certainly can.

1218
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,960
The difference is the differences.

1219
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:26,794
If Tony Goes,

1220
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,723
you know what?

1221
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,010
I know you're fast apart from
these first three rounds.

1222
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,621
I,

1223
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,350
I'm a college collegiate wrestler.

1224
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:33,071
Fuck this noise.

1225
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:34,990
I'm just going to ankle
pick you all fucking day.

1226
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:35,360
It's true.

1227
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,831
Then third,

1228
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:36,131
fourth,

1229
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:36,341
fifth,

1230
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:37,390
I'm start striking with you,

1231
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,840
but Connor could catch him wet laundry.

1232
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,290
It's a good fight.

1233
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,370
Ridiculous speed.

1234
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,320
Tony doesn't get tired.

1235
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,680
I haven't seen him get tired.

1236
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,671
He's tired.

1237
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:49,150
He doesn't show it cause
he's a fucking serial killer.

1238
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,560
Oh yeah.

1239
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,720
He is less tired than the other guy.

1240
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,091
Your Mama,

1241
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:52,751
she gets tired.

1242
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:53,770
Brian last time.

1243
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:55,720
Everybody gets tired and
it's just here for it.

1244
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:55,990
But,

1245
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,561
but it is.

1246
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:58,510
But he also is ridiculous conditioning.

1247
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:01,660
You Know Amy Bravo was his fucking
Jujitsu trainer and Eddie said he's never

1248
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:02,800
seen anything like this guy.

1249
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,080
He said the guy who trains
for six hours a day,

1250
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:05,980
the cities,

1251
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,660
he's in big Barry's running hills,

1252
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,880
literally lapping his training partners.

1253
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,950
I turned around and go
back and run a trail,

1254
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,400
run up to the top of that.

1255
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,980
That is such an advantage.

1256
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:15,940
And a five round fight.

1257
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,241
I mean,

1258
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,620
such an advantage and a three round fight.

1259
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:17,950
I mean,

1260
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,430
his ability to just not like when
you're less tired than the other guy.

1261
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,111
Oh my God.

1262
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:23,170
Those camps are big bear.

1263
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,621
He goes,

1264
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:24,460
he rents a house.

1265
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,320
He builds his own fucking
training facility.

1266
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,910
He sets up his own heavy bags.

1267
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
He mats up floors,

1268
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,490
he takes a fucking room.

1269
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,600
He's got like a living room,

1270
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:32,200
but house.

1271
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,460
He sets down the borders,

1272
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,440
brings in the mats and
they start training.

1273
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,850
He refines of hills,

1274
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,230
runs those fucking hills
at 6,000 feet out to

1275
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,010
50 fives no punk men.

1276
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,410
He's not asked Eddie
Alvarez who we can now,

1277
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,750
he's a fucking punk.

1278
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:48,710
Not to say like at first I was like,

1279
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:48,861
God,

1280
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:50,600
this is getting kind of
the way I look at him.

1281
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,434
Like,

1282
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:51,980
you know,

1283
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,780
he does get hit first and gets hit man.

1284
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,120
Yeah.

1285
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,990
The problem child is Khabib,

1286
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,220
Khabib [inaudible].

1287
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,140
It's almost a round table
because it could be verse Tony.

1288
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,471
Hello.

1289
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:01,304
A fight could,

1290
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,510
could be versus Connor.

1291
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:02,811
God,

1292
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:03,710
that's tough fight for Conor,

1293
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:05,180
but they can eliminate each other.

1294
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:06,410
It's whoever shows up that night.

1295
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,490
It's a fucking good fight,

1296
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:08,324
man.

1297
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,920
Takes your legs down.

1298
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,970
We're going to know all about,

1299
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,610
could be this weekend when
he fights Edson Barboza.

1300
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,760
We're going to see him with arguably
the fastest tracker and 155 pounds.

1301
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,760
It doesn't give a fuck
about going the ground.

1302
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:20,031
He's like,

1303
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:20,270
no,

1304
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,081
we're not going to ground.

1305
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:22,850
I'm might be on a team
that were other guys.

1306
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,773
We'll play that game.

1307
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,210
Right?

1308
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,390
Anti wrestling will kick
you in the fucking face.

1309
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:26,630
Right,

1310
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,470
but how do you keep them from taking
you to the ground when he gets into my

1311
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:30,770
work?

1312
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,760
You avoid the clinch.

1313
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:31,940
Yeah.

1314
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,661
How do you avoid that?

1315
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:33,440
With Khabib?

1316
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,160
Hard.

1317
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,941
That's fucking hard.

1318
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:35,301
It's not,

1319
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:36,140
it's not an easy fight.

1320
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,370
Five stretch of the imagination,

1321
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,710
but you've got to realize
to be Michael Johnson.

1322
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,980
Crack could be when they
fought and had them wobbling.

1323
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:45,680
It's the first time we've seen any
adversity that could be you had to face

1324
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:46,431
inside the octagon.

1325
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:48,740
Buddy handled it with fucking four aces.

1326
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,850
Took him to the ground.

1327
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,631
He's got to show him.

1328
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:54,200
I had no idea it could be one up to two
oh five when he trains like well he gets

1329
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:54,860
heavy,

1330
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,260
he gets heavy in between
five 29 due at this time.

1331
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,850
Daniel Cormier I say as a new nutrition
and he said he is been lighter getting

1332
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:03,260
ready for this camp than any fight before.

1333
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,670
He was 179 pounds.

1334
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,690
Just a couple of weeks ago,

1335
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,620
Josh Thompson was like,

1336
00:34:06,621 --> 00:34:06,831
Dude,

1337
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:09,770
you've never seen anything like it cause
I was talking about Connor and could

1338
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:09,861
be,

1339
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:10,190
and he's like,

1340
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,370
dude,

1341
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,210
I'm telling you man.

1342
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,540
I seen him go with DC.

1343
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,450
I've seem to all the guys and think about,

1344
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,231
think about what he did.

1345
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:15,980
Joe Angeles,

1346
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,030
think about what he did.

1347
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,110
He bragged them [inaudible] 70 and I go,

1348
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:21,780
why does it get beat?

1349
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,491
Just go to set me up.

1350
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:23,390
He sees what he's going to,

1351
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:28,430
he's going to do is get the belt at 55
as soon as he get that he's going piece

1352
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:33,431
and then at 70 enjoy that and enjoy that
mother fucker at 70 it's like he gets

1353
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:35,390
you and it breaks your legs down.

1354
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:35,720
It's like,

1355
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:35,811
oh,

1356
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:36,644
you're a table.

1357
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,410
I'm going to take your legs down now
you're on the crown and that's it.

1358
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:39,990
Well,

1359
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,880
the leading buddy,

1360
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:42,710
get them off all elite wrestlers.

1361
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,041
Right?

1362
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:46,220
Whether you're talking about Dave
Schultz or whether you're talking about,

1363
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:47,054
you know,

1364
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,703
Carolyn,

1365
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,080
all the best of the best wrestlers,

1366
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,170
they have an ability
to enforce their will,

1367
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:59,760
power into God and do shit to them
that they don't want don and break up.

1368
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,590
They see it.

1369
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,080
They were you like a technique with will,

1370
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,250
with physical conditioning,

1371
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:05,084
with everything.

1372
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,220
Bdcs the same way.

1373
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,410
All the best guys have everything.

1374
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,970
They have all the components,

1375
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,021
and that's one of the things.

1376
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:12,830
Number Command off does.

1377
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,110
Then you add the fact
that he's from Dagestan.

1378
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,470
You add the fact that he grew up in one
of the hardest places in the fucking

1379
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:18,740
world.

1380
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,250
That's right.

1381
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,440
And everyone around him as hard as nails,

1382
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,900
where I think the national
sport might be wrestling,

1383
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:24,650
might be murder.

1384
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,483
Yeah.

1385
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,770
Get a varsity in murder in high school.

1386
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,560
It's a crazy place,

1387
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,350
which we discussed is him verse Barboza.

1388
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,560
If it's like a video game,

1389
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:36,200
you look at their attributes
Barboza strikings like this,

1390
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,034
but just wrestling's like,

1391
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,420
yeah,

1392
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:37,771
we like,

1393
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:38,040
it could

1394
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,420
be his wrestling's like this,

1395
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:39,920
but striking.

1396
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,400
So you're intrigued by this.

1397
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,450
Fuck yeah.

1398
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,313
Fuck yeah.

1399
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,100
Fuck is the most intriguing fight that
it could be was ever fought by fog.

1400
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,541
Never.

1401
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:49,374
Two reasons.

1402
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:49,890
One,

1403
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,940
the two fights where he had so much
difficulty making weight that his body was

1404
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:54,571
shutting down.

1405
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,190
It happened in the Michael Johnson fight.

1406
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,160
Then it happened again.

1407
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,630
The Toby,

1408
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,231
Tony Ferguson.

1409
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:00,150
Five th the point they
pulled them off the car,

1410
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,390
so they were saying his liver was
shutting down like this is serious,

1411
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:04,224
serious shit.

1412
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,390
He has not made one 55 cents.

1413
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:06,661
Right.

1414
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:07,680
He hasn't fought since,

1415
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,160
so there's so much pressure
on him to do this correctly,

1416
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,600
but who knows if he can.

1417
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,360
When your body does not
want to do that anymore,

1418
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,910
you run into serious problems is one
of the things that happens to older

1419
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:20,700
athletes when they've been cutting
extreme amounts of weight over and over

1420
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:21,120
again.

1421
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,930
They get to a point where their bodies
take every time you cut 30 pounds of

1422
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:26,010
water from your body,

1423
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,890
your body goes into like a state of shock.

1424
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,360
You do some damage.

1425
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,280
The question is how much
damage are you doing?

1426
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,130
Think how long he's been doing it to
Josh Johnson brought to that point.

1427
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:35,431
He goes,

1428
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:35,641
dude,

1429
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,350
he's been cutting weight
since he was a kid.

1430
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,030
Like he's been in these wrestling terms,

1431
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,410
the Samba terms since he was a kid.

1432
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:41,700
So He's older now.

1433
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,560
He's been cutting weight for a fucking f.

1434
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:44,670
And here's a real question.

1435
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:45,381
Here's a real question,

1436
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:46,860
and fought for the title.

1437
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,970
If he wins the title,

1438
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,490
how the fuck is he going
to defend it in California?

1439
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,590
He's not going to,

1440
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:51,800
wow.

1441
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,020
Yeah,

1442
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,150
because California has new strict laws.

1443
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,660
Oh no,

1444
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,370
he's not watching any foster.

1445
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:59,790
The guy runs the California State Athletic
Commission is one of the best guys in

1446
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:00,360
the sport.

1447
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,610
He's so proactive.

1448
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:02,401
He's so ahead of it.

1449
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:03,690
He's adding weight classes.

1450
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,850
He's doing so much to make this safe.

1451
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:06,241
And he was a,

1452
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:07,260
he's a martial artist,

1453
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:08,490
lifelong martial artist himself,

1454
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,713
and he competed.

1455
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,630
So here's a guy who sees what
the problems are and he says,

1456
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:12,841
okay,

1457
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:16,040
we're going to make sure you don't weigh
15 pounds more when you get into the

1458
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,100
octa the night of the fight.

1459
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,993
Yeah.

1460
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,440
The other percentage,

1461
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:19,681
right.

1462
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:21,420
Is it a percentage of
weight that you can't gain?

1463
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:21,871
No,

1464
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:22,081
no,

1465
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:22,211
it's,

1466
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:23,580
it's a little mound sites,

1467
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,560
I think at 55 can't come
in and heavier than,

1468
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,480
it's like 15.5 or something like that,

1469
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:30,090
so like 70 which could
be concurring bigger.

1470
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,420
Bebes just going to get the top of
them dip out public place in Tiba,

1471
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:33,830
glycine,

1472
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,140
Tiba would fight at 55 and he literally
looked like he was 200 pounds in a

1473
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,470
fight.

1474
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:37,921
I heard,

1475
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,390
I heard that Darren tell,

1476
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,650
and I'm sure you'll hear this,

1477
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:41,310
but I already,

1478
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,120
when he stepped into the octagon
against cowboy and he was 201 pounds.

1479
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,370
Yes,

1480
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,110
that's what I heard too.

1481
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,400
Enjoy beating during tiller it.

1482
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,303
Enjoy it.

1483
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,140
No,

1484
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,070
no one wants to fight him.

1485
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:52,470
He suffered much warranty for,

1486
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,731
he even said he fight.

1487
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:54,301
My pay goes,

1488
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:54,601
listen,

1489
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:56,280
I don't give a fuck about rankings belt.

1490
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:57,090
I'll fight right now.

1491
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,110
He wants to put on a show,

1492
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,290
he wants to light people on fire and
no one wants to get in there with them.

1493
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:02,310
They saw that cowboy fine.

1494
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,610
They're like,

1495
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,920
oh shoot.

1496
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,130
Then you learn a story like,

1497
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,611
oh my God,

1498
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:06,300
he's a nightmare.

1499
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,133
Wonderful,

1500
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,591
wonderful.

1501
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:07,921
It was like,

1502
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:08,701
let's do this.

1503
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:09,461
Then when the boys dad,

1504
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:10,294
he was like,

1505
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:10,571
no,

1506
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:12,000
but Wonderboy did not say let's do that.

1507
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:12,761
Let me be honest with you.

1508
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:13,081
I wonder.

1509
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,010
Boy had hurt.

1510
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:14,431
Thumbs said.

1511
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:16,920
He told me about in the
ring after the fight,

1512
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,320
his thumbs in the cage after the fight.

1513
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:21,660
He said his thumbs pretty fucked up
cause he was talking about it in between

1514
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:23,130
rounds with its corner and I said,

1515
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:24,090
what were you saying about your hands?

1516
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:24,271
He goes,

1517
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:24,631
yeah man,

1518
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:27,300
I did something to my thumbs like I hit,

1519
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,040
you know he's throwing these crazy
fucking punches on a guy like Jorge Mas

1520
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,070
withal who's no joke,

1521
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:32,400
right?

1522
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,910
Hell No.

1523
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,110
He's catching elbows.

1524
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,160
He's catching foreheads and he fucked

1525
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,390
us thumbs up and he might need
surgery like he doesn't know has no,

1526
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,713
I don't know.

1527
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,770
But for sure he was in a position where
he had some serious injuries that they

1528
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:48,210
were saying like we got in Dana white
even tweeted it or something that we

1529
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:48,480
didn't,

1530
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,960
no days out the fight.

1531
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:50,141
Right.

1532
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:50,650
Yeah.

1533
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,300
I even said thank you Jesus.

1534
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,670
I screenshot it feeling like,

1535
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,211
Holy Shit,

1536
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:56,044
it's going down.

1537
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,670
That's a great fight.

1538
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,240
Great fight.

1539
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,811
If it happened,

1540
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:01,270
boy or boy who fought Errol Spence.

1541
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:01,930
Um,

1542
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,970
I was just with uh,

1543
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,900
a fight to wildcard west.

1544
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,340
Why am I forgetting I'm getting old?

1545
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:06,821
Oh,

1546
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:07,450
Chris,

1547
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:07,661
Chris,

1548
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:09,730
Chris Mayer was showing me like,

1549
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:12,540
he's a boxer quality box had
been around forever and fought,

1550
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:13,750
fought or I'll Spence but got beat.

1551
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,943
But um,

1552
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,240
you know,

1553
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,390
a high level boxer and he was showing me,

1554
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,290
he was just showing me,

1555
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:20,801
like I said,

1556
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:22,330
why is Errol Spence so good?

1557
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:22,960
Because he,

1558
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,793
I know he's great,

1559
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,990
but he looks like basic,

1560
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,580
like he does like jab one,

1561
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,433
two and he,

1562
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,890
so for my eye as not a
very sophisticated guy,

1563
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,760
I can't see what's making them so good.

1564
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:33,961
Right,

1565
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:34,600
right.

1566
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,830
And he was showing me,

1567
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,590
it was really a yesterday
just showing me how,

1568
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,110
like he was able to measure his jab.

1569
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:43,540
So Chris would throw a jab and he goes,

1570
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,710
Watch and I throw a jab and he goes and
he would move back just like his ability

1571
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:49,360
to move back just,

1572
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,590
just enough.

1573
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:53,380
So some guys move back just a little
bit too much and then went back a little

1574
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:54,161
bit and then they throw.

1575
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:54,491
So their,

1576
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:57,400
their measurement of distance is just
a little off and you have time to

1577
00:39:57,401 --> 00:40:02,230
compensate his ability to move back the
precise amount so that you don't have

1578
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,310
time to react because he comes back,

1579
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:03,551
boom,

1580
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:04,300
it hits you again.

1581
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,670
So every time you throw he would make it.

1582
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:11,050
So his ability to sort of be just
had a reach was better than anybody.

1583
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:11,531
He had fought.

1584
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:11,681
Well,

1585
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:12,320
no one's better.

1586
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,510
So that shit didn't Loma Chenko.

1587
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,320
Correct.

1588
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,430
But also to that point,

1589
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,390
Billy Joe Saunders,

1590
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:17,224
who was like,

1591
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,041
what?

1592
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,050
And then beat the brakes off of,

1593
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,770
did you see Billy Joe Saunders?

1594
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,161
He's amazing.

1595
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:25,490
He might be able to be triple g.

1596
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,380
He's amazing.

1597
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,060
He's ridiculous.

1598
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:31,210
Fucking jabs were my thing of the past.

1599
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:31,540
Right.

1600
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,260
He would just plop that side in there,

1601
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:34,420
pop and then it'd be left.

1602
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:34,910
Right.

1603
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,140
Do,

1604
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,620
here we go.

1605
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,930
This was a world title fight.

1606
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,850
Hopefully if mrs was a huge,

1607
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,270
uh,

1608
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,560
swinging like right hand,

1609
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,450
he goes like this into the stands.

1610
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:44,500
Like he's no misses it.

1611
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,280
Yeah.

1612
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,500
On the brain's looks Billy Joe looks
like as if who you're trying to hit is he

1613
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,350
[inaudible] Saunders from Wales.

1614
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,660
He said he's a gypsy gypsy,

1615
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:53,290
but he's from,

1616
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:57,100
he's from the last say
Gypsy Trafford now traveler.

1617
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,780
You gotta be careful.

1618
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,470
[inaudible] I called a fury of Gypsy.

1619
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,370
A legit like traveler came to
the show and was like traveler,

1620
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:03,911
quick Collins.

1621
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:04,744
Gypsies.

1622
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:04,991
Yeah.

1623
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:05,950
They don't like gypsy,

1624
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,300
but people say it all the time.

1625
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:07,721
Sorry,

1626
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:09,290
I keep saying it on HBO.

1627
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,280

1628

Fucking monster.

1630
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,990
I hope fury comes back.

1631
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:18,710
He's on my feet and stuff.

1632
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:19,030
You don't know.

1633
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,571
Look him up,

1634
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:19,751

1635
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:21,370
He's doxing eats that guy.

1636
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,130
David Lemieux fight on HBO
was a Goddamn Work of art.

1637
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,431
It was,

1638
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:24,951
God didn't work.

1639
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:27,010
And now his campaign for
triple g and they they,

Canela there's no one wants
to fight Billy Joe Saunders

1644
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,263

1650
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,880

1653
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:51,050
You know who he is.

1654
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:53,780
I know who he is and I think the world
was introduced to them at that last HBO

1655
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,130
card though.

1656
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,300
But this is just a word I do because I
saw him fight triple g fight in Montreal.

1657
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:00,990
He's huge and they were
fighting in Montreal.

1658
00:42:00,991 --> 00:42:01,341
That's true.

1659
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:02,300
But see Billy Joe,

1660
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:03,710
this is his first fight in America.

1661
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:04,910
All of his fights had been in Europe.

1662
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:05,190
Yeah.

1663
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,851
So this is like,

1664
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:10,610
but he's been watched a lot
because he's so his flashy,

1665
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,230
like as neat as neat kind of like really.

1666
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:12,561
Well,

1667
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:12,861
he says,

1668
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:13,121
Christ,

1669
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:13,954
he's smart.

1670
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,740
He has a mouth on him and you know what,

1671
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:20,210
I'm the guy you can root for Jim
Lampley and Roy Jones Jr had a little

1672
00:42:20,211 --> 00:42:21,650
disagreement and the commentary,

1673
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,790
oh Jim Lampley was like,

1674
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:22,881
well,

1675
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:23,930
if he's this far ahead,

1676
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,400
why does he not trying to knock them out?

1677
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,331
Roy Jones was like,

1678
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:28,730
why would he do you see what he's doing?

1679
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,001
He's,

1680
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:30,350
he's boxed in his face off.

1681
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:30,830
He's like,

1682
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,460
well you have the added humiliation that
you do to your opponent when you knock

1683
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:34,701
them out.

1684
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:37,180
Like stay in your Lane Jim lamp.

1685
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,320
Stand in your fucking fuck.

1686
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,240
It was embarrassing.

1687
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,560
So you just said that to Roy Jones Jr
you're talking about one of the greatest

1688
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:52,640
knockout artists in the history of the
fucking sport was telling him why someone

1689
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:53,000
should,

1690
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,860
you don't just knock someone out.

1691
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,860
You have to put yourself in danger to
knock someone out and you could wind up

1692
00:42:57,861 --> 00:43:00,040
losing against the fucking
power puncher like Limu,

1693
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,570
your life and box and you lose that fight.

1694
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,553
Everything shot,

1695
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,180
the Canelo,

1696
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:05,811
triple g fights,

1697
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:10,550
gone fumes that place fighting a beautiful
pattern for him to alter that pattern

1698
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:13,040
to get a specific result that's not smart.

1699
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,060
And it's not boxing.

1700
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:15,230
That's not what you're supposed to do.

1701
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:15,950
Silly.

1702
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,131
Yeah.

1703
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:18,080
Here's his highlight reel and you see,

1704
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,970
see him move around him and
he's so interesting with
his right jab to he throws

1705
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:23,960
punches and then he's like,

1706
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:24,231
whoops,

1707
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:24,921
not here anymore,

1708
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:25,360
dude.

1709
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,440
I got up to the Lemieux fight.

1710
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:27,861
If you can get,

1711
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:31,470
that was one of the best fights because
Lemieux was a legit world contender.

1712
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:32,470
But the class,

1713
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,710
the thing with Billy Joe Saunders,

1714
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:34,820
if his highlights,

1715
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,110
they do them justice somewhat,

1716
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:38,600
but he always steps up to
the level of competition.

1717
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:39,950
So you might watch them
against a guy like,

1718
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:40,071
hey,

1719
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:40,790
it looks all right.

1720
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,070
But then when he Chris Eubank Junior,

1721
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,581
you look at him,

1722
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:46,130
he gets Lemieux like holy
fuck this guy's world plot.

1723
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,401
Yeah.

1724
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:49,970
Here's look Saunders against Eubanks jr
he will fight to whoever is levels that.

1725
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:50,600
Yeah.

1726
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,950
That's why I think he,

1727
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,480
and he's big too for the weight class.

1728
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
So a triple g or Canelo you got to fight.

1729
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,950
He's big and he's so fucking smart,

1730
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:58,460
man,

1731
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,410
that the big thing is how smart he is.

1732
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:00,921
I mean,

1733
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:05,060
his ring Iq and his ability to
not get hit is so exceptional.

1734
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,730
Steps just back and look
how he changes it up.

1735
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,571
She goes to the head,

1736
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:09,680
he goes to the body,

1737
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,160
he,

1738
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,730
he's like,

1739
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:11,451
he's an artist,

1740
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:11,691
man,

1741
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,501
a real artist.

1742
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:13,760
It's really fun watching him.

1743
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,750
Beautiful lefthand,

1744
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,160
and he has a personality.

1745
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,950
Funny Spanish shit talks,

1746
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:19,550
mad shit.

1747
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,800
He told Amelia some
extra pants from his son.

1748
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:22,251
They can work.

1749
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:23,084
Just let me short.

1750
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,920
Just kept talking shit.

1751
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,070
And he's also best
friends with fury still.

1752
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:29,330
They're like perfect.

1753
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,870
Baffin and rob and they're fucking man.

1754
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,983
Yeah.

1755
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:37,030
I was surprised that they referred to
him as a gypsy on the HBO broadcast.

1756
00:44:37,031 --> 00:44:38,930
You're not supposed to
think it was Jim Lampley to,

1757
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,440
he's an older fellow.

1758
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,940
I thought Gypsy is a cool word,

1759
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:42,774
but I think so too.

1760
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,710
If you go over to London,

1761
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:48,510
they told me not to say that her Roma
Roma is considered Roma is considered

1762
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,221
derogatory.

1763
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:50,491
Right.

1764
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:52,850
So they were always just no aroma.

1765
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,510
Donald Cerrone versus
Yancey Madeiros UFC Austin.

1766
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,351
That's a good one.

1767
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:02,190
70 for Serone because Yancey
is not a giant one 70 you know,

1768
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:02,990
it's not like a,

1769
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,620
that fight of the year.

1770
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:08,990
Some people think that was a crazy
fight against cowboy early vera whole

1771
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:11,860
Austin Yancy.

1772
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,380
Crazy.

1773
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,170
What a fucking performance
by Yancy February 18th.

1774
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,863
That's close.

1775
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:18,421
That's weird.

1776
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:18,921
They announce it.

1777
00:45:18,921 --> 00:45:19,590
You really,

1778
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,423
that's really close.

1779
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,180
Real close for Yancey
from that last fight.

1780
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,080
The fight was a barn burner
and that was only a month ago.

1781
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:28,951
That's weird.

1782
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:31,050
And not much time to
promote either for Austin.

1783
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,561
Yeah,

1784
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,450
well I don't think you need
it for cowboy in Austin.

1785
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:35,670
That mother fucker will sell out
quick and it's a fight night.

1786
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:36,504
So it's not paper.

1787
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,160
It's a good headline of,

1788
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:38,640
for sure.

1789
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,990
Great headline for fight night for Yancey
mean he took a lot of hard shots and

1790
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:43,520
that,

1791
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,630
I don't know if that's given
him enough time to recover.

1792
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,100
It doesn't make a lot of sense,

1793
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:47,731
but if you're a dancer,

1794
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:49,020
you're jumping at the opportunity.

1795
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:49,171
Oh,

1796
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:49,951
you hear a fucking,

1797
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,310
uh,

1798
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,050
Jimmy Rivera's off with John Linacre.

1799
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,621
Yeah.

1800
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:53,610
Luna Lineker got hurt.

1801
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,690
And then do you see,

1802
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,450
uh,

1803
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:55,620
uh,

1804
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,251
Jimmy Rivera,

1805
00:45:56,251 --> 00:46:00,720
who to me is my dark horse and
that division man fucking monster.

1806
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:01,591
And then,

1807
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:01,790
uh,

1808
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:02,310
he was kind of,

1809
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,240
he's trying to get Murrayas right?

1810
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,391
He goes,

1811
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:06,720
you,

1812
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,560
if you'd even,

1813
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,570
you said you do that five
pounds to give you five pounds,

1814
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:10,623
it's team said no.

1815
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,723
I said No.

1816
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,121
And then he goes,

1817
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:13,050
I'll give you 10 pounds.

1818
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:13,631
I just want to fight.

1819
00:46:13,631 --> 00:46:14,141
It might not be in,

1820
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:16,320
she still went know Marlin
might not be in shape.

1821
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,820
He can add them in jail.

1822
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,860
Let's fucking do it.

1823
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:20,281
Well,

1824
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:22,680
Martin just really recently,

1825
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,280
spectacular knockouts didn't get
touched against aljamain sterling.

1826
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,323
And he's,

1827
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:27,721
you know,

1828
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:31,470
he's in that position where he's climbing
the ladder to and to take a short

1829
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,880
notice fight mark.

1830
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:34,940
Henry's very wise in that regard.

1831
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,401
And they're like,

1832
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:35,720
look,

1833
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,020
you talk to any coaches in the world.

1834
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:37,943
I agree.

1835
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,270
You can beat this guy,

1836
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,100
but do you beat this guy this way?

1837
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,850
Maybe,

1838
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,760
but do you beat this guy when
you have a long training camp?

1839
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:45,660
Much better odds,

1840
00:46:45,661 --> 00:46:46,500
and that's the way to do it.

1841
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,430
To really show who you really are.

1842
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:49,160
I agree 100% I wouldn't have done it if,

1843
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,150
if I'm mark or I'm telling
my fight or not to do.

1844
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,380
It's a pro sport,

1845
00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:52,890
man.

1846
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,760
It's a pro sport.

1847
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:57,350
You have to weigh these
short term opportunities
like Michael Bisping got when

1848
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:57,500
the,

1849
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,980
when he stepped up to fight Luke Rockhold.

1850
00:46:58,981 --> 00:46:59,850
You've got to weigh those.

1851
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,330
Yeah,

1852
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:00,571
look,

1853
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:03,900
Bisping it fucking paid off
and it paid off in spades,

1854
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:04,290
right?

1855
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:04,910
He chaos.

1856
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,450
Rockhold it becomes a
middleweight champion.

1857
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,270
The worlds of fills a
lifetime dream all on 11 days.

1858
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:14,080
Notice to the fucking man has cast iron
bowling balls hanging from his dick like

1859
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,060
you can't.

1860
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,800
He's the best deny that about my thing.

1861
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,580
Then,

1862
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,960
but then the same thing,

1863
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:22,320
that same mentality as to bites him in
the ass and he goes and fights Calvin

1864
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:25,820
gassed alum just a few days
after fighting a fucking crazy.

1865
00:47:25,821 --> 00:47:28,050
You fight with George Saint
Pierre and he doesn't look good.

1866
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:28,930
He looked horrible.

1867
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,010
Then look at Machida.

1868
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,940
He just got starched and now he's
headlining and where the fuck they're did

1869
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,340
Gagas Stan or starts,

1870
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,690
you've got starts and then any tested
positive blue Machida's last fight.

1871
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,820
Machida tested positive for his last,

1872
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:48,180
his last fight Machita Machita was
suspended for something for Derek Brunson.

1873
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:49,380
Yeah.

1874
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,550
Before then he had two years off
and then he finds two off I think.

1875
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:54,820
Pretty sure two years crazy.

1876
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,481
They fight.

1877
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:57,070
Derek Brunson got starched,

1878
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:57,290
right.

1879
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:57,541
And then like,

1880
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:57,730
hey,

1881
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,550
we need a main event for where the
fuck it is polling or whatever.

1882
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,950
And then he originally said no.

1883
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,170
And then I heard he was talked into it.

1884
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,610
And then who's he fighting?

1885
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,043
A Cheetah.

1886
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:08,910
Um,

1887
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:09,250
uh,

1888
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:09,491
God.

1889
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:10,324
Who's he fighting?

1890
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,100
Jamie cannot be fast enough here.

1891
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:13,450
There's no way he could do both things.

1892
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:14,440
We need to hire another dude.

1893
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,303
Come on man.

1894
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,513
These to,

1895
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,550
while he's doing that,

1896
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,380
he make the fastest one
hand a typer in the world.

1897
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,150
He's pretty good.

1898
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:24,130
On one hand working on
the fucking Tri Caster,

1899
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,390
one hand work in the team.

1900
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:26,500
He was a high school basketball player.

1901
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:28,120
PRY would've gotten t two t three.

1902
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,343
It's Anders.

1903
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,740
What Anders?

1904
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,420
That sound right.

1905
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,860
You want to see something disturbing?

1906
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,173
There's a,

1907
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,700
this evidence of Jamie's
basketball playing online.

1908
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,661
Uh,

1909
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:38,494
Anders.

1910
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,083
Who's Anders?

1911
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,150
Which Anders sounds sounds church.

1912
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,353
The gentleman's name.

1913
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,190
Eric.

1914
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,390
Eric Anderson to Brazil.

1915
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,240
But he's just got starched
and they say this one.

1916
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:51,280
Well he could sell a lot
of tickets in Brazil.

1917
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,001
No,

1918
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:52,631
I get that.

1919
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:53,261
I get all of this.

1920
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:54,610
Got legitimate three point skills.

1921
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,700
I watched your a that video
of you just hitting threes.

1922
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:58,321
Jamie's man,

1923
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:00,130
he didn't need to watch this after this.

1924
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:00,460
I was like,

1925
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:00,800
hmm,

1926
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,060
Jamie,

1927
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,360
my pen,

1928
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,220
the spectrum watching this.

1929
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:03,970
I was watching.

1930
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,331
I'm like,

1931
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:04,811
he might be like,

1932
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,610
Oh rain man with this.

1933
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,590
It was so impressed.

1934
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,830
I was like come and be
like in a hypnotic state.

1935
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:13,540
He's been using the zone.

1936
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:14,501
It's called the zone.

1937
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:15,334
Yeah Dude.

1938
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:16,183
Let's call it the zone.

1939
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,500
The zone we are talking about.

1940
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:19,960
You could get Jamie to do that all day.

1941
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,010
Well you have so much room.

1942
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:22,740
Let's put up a basketball court half.

1943
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,770
That's not really from me,

1944
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:26,323
his whole,

1945
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,941
but watch these shots.

1946
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:29,690
Seriously Swish.

1947
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,760
I gotta Watch it here.

1948
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:31,271
Comes into the ball.

1949
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:31,750
Watch this.

1950
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,320
There it is.

1951
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,180
Look like a young Jj Redick
so do understand how hard
this is to do for a guy

1952
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:40,210
who is a essentially we one
mess one just a slight mess.

1953
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:41,883
Look at that Swish.

1954
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,120
I mean get the fuck Outta here.

1955
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:43,880
Jamie.

1956
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,100
Are you read a rain man?

1957
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,830
How are you able to do this and plan
is holding this but seriously tag rain

1958
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:54,640
drops and drops as white chocolate.

1959
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,250
Hashtag various uh,

1960
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:01,150
that is hilarious.

1961
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,440
Jamie's got lit real scale.

1962
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,720
Well that those guys that are like
super calm and measured and level,

1963
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,860
we're always a scary as guys that play
pool with because guys like Jamie were

1964
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:13,110
always the guys that liked,

1965
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:14,920
they didn't get too hard
and they didn't get low.

1966
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,140
They just like they,

1967
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:19,400
and then they figured out how to get
into that zone and they'd be tariffs on.

1968
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:19,960
Yeah,

1969
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,501
I bet he's not.

1970
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:22,210
I mean I saw that the three points,

1971
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,060
those shoots,

1972
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,801
the shots you're making.

1973
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:24,160
I was like,

1974
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,970
okay,

1975
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,260
Jamie's got that weird year.

1976
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,410
I got that weird mental gear.

1977
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:29,240
You get a click the taps into the zone.

1978
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,410
Who I did a movie with,

1979
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:31,041
a guy like Josh,

1980
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:31,761
the pool player.

1981
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:32,530
We met,

1982
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,050
um,

1983
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:33,471
the girl,

1984
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:37,600
the Belo toward the Texas
Tornado by you getting Villareal.

1985
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:37,911
Yeah,

1986
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:38,720
she's bad ass.

1987
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,470
She's a bad ass.

1988
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,550
She's bad ass pool player.

1989
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:43,430
She'll make you feel very
uncomfortable with your manhood.

1990
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,380
But something about
losing to a chicken pool.

1991
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,270
Really embed some about it,

1992
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:48,380
man pools a man's game.

1993
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,160
Oh Man.

1994
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,090
Fuck in pool.

1995
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:50,511
Really?

1996
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:51,051
Say that.

1997
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:51,884
But if you can

1998
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,230
give you,

1999
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:55,440
because it's about four,

2000
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:55,790
it's,

2001
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:56,601
this is what it's about.

2002
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:58,790
It's about keeping your nerves
together under pressure.

2003
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,970
So when a woman is better keeping her
nerves gather under pressure and guys

2004
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:05,330
bobble shots and miss nine balls and
you're like [inaudible] some people,

2005
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:06,530
they're just built for games.

2006
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:09,110
Like I did a movie with
the guy who was just like,

2007
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:09,830
he'd play,

2008
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,170
I played chess with him and he was,

2009
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,730
I used to play with my dad is,

2010
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:16,190
and he's beating me so
quickly and I was like,

2011
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:17,540
what are you,

2012
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,360
why are you so good?

2013
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:18,860
He goes,

2014
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,011
oh,

2015
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:19,311
just,

2016
00:51:19,311 --> 00:51:19,491
you know,

2017
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:20,240
I'm just playing.

2018
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:20,630
I go,

2019
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:21,463
all right,

2020
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:22,610
I'll have you read books on chess.

2021
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:23,444
He goes,

2022
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,970
of course I went,

2023
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,080
oh well it's his thing

2024
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:29,661
and I played pool.

2025
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:30,670
He beat everybody at pulled.

2026
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,950
Then we play paint might be everything.

2027
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,520
There's some things in the game guys.

2028
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,670
Guys just good at everything he's,

2029
00:51:34,671 --> 00:51:35,240
he's got,

2030
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,060
he's got game theory like he
noticed what Mack Ping Pong.

2031
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,380
I pride myself on my pink button.

2032
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:41,420
I'm not good but I think I
am and I'll talk a big game.

2033
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:46,280
He noticed that my fucking
that my backhand over here,

2034
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:47,360
it's a little suspect.

2035
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,880
So of course he just saw whole,

2036
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,450
am I getting those people that can
see a hole there strategically?

2037
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,020
Sounds like you played Rozzie
k fucking hole in his game,

2038
00:51:54,021 --> 00:51:55,250
but that get that.

2039
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,810
I was like this play a lot of games.

2040
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:57,620
Does he yell it?

2041
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,850
If I saw a whole new game,

2042
00:51:58,851 --> 00:52:00,560
I'm not going to do that
cause I want to play the game.

2043
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,510
What we had laid makes the voice of our,

2044
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,070
hold on,

2045
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:04,700
wait a minute.

2046
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,200
You wouldn't try to win.

2047
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,561
I don't know.

2048
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:07,151
Depending on,

2049
00:52:07,151 --> 00:52:08,480
I don't give a fuck about winning.

2050
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,110
I don't give a fuck about beating you.

2051
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,600
Find out the guys get a shitty half guard.

2052
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:14,090
You tell him you don't go towards his
half guard all the time when I street

2053
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:14,361
fight.

2054
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:14,870
Yes.

2055
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:15,441
Honestly,

2056
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:16,101
when I straight out,

2057
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:17,480
I'm not going into his half guts.

2058
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,950
Piss on your hips.

2059
00:52:21,951 --> 00:52:22,784
At least limit,

2060
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,600
bring it out.

2061
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,380
Let me go.

2062
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,210
And I taught street fight
and might come back.

2063
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:29,050
Stay out of your medium
sized street fighting.

2064
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,721
When I come back,

2065
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:31,040
don't fucking shut the fuck.

2066
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:32,330
Don't talk about street fighting with me,

2067
00:52:32,331 --> 00:52:32,541
dude.

2068
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:33,430
I take it very serious.

2069
00:52:33,431 --> 00:52:35,540
So Watson with Wayne and your
friends and then when I come back,

2070
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,471
shut the fucking,

2071
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:37,530
I'm a boxer and I,

2072
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:38,060
and I rethink,

2073
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,170
you get hit too much in the head.

2074
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,350
As an older guy who does power lifting,

2075
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,730
did you see that new thing where they
said that they train AI to play chess?

2076
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:49,890
There's a new AI program and um,

2077
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,610
not only did it beat
some world chess master,

2078
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:53,030
I just,

2079
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,840
I just tweeted it,

2080
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,860
see if you could pull that shit up.

2081
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:55,820
But uh,

2082
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,151
by the way,

2083
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:57,230
it is from the Daily Mail,

2084
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:57,990
which you got to go.

2085
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:58,820
Hmm.

2086
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,130
There might be exaggerating a little bit.

2087
00:53:00,131 --> 00:53:00,320
Yeah.

2088
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,153
But it said that the,

2089
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:05,720
that this chess computer had invented
a series of moves that no one had ever

2090
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:06,554
seen before.

2091
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:07,800
So it's scary.

2092
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,080
It's being creative.

2093
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,340
It did a move.

2094
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:12,770
It did like a pattern that
no one had seen before.

2095
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,260
So it's figuring out
how to play on the job.

2096
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,250
This is whole movement out.

2097
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,260
People are writing books on my,

2098
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,290
on how to deal with the second
smart machine agent in four hours.

2099
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:24,380
A robot taught itself chest and
beat a grand master with moves.

2100
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:25,650
Never devised the games.

2101
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:27,150
1500 year history.

2102
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:28,680
And the implications are terrifying.

2103
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,443
Yeah,

2104
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:30,991
for sure.

2105
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:35,991
And so what that the more terrifying
thing besides is the fact that massive,

2106
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,440
massive sections of our
job markets are going away.

2107
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:40,711
Yeah.

2108
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:41,081
Look at what a,

2109
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:41,914
what do we do?

2110
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,940
Oxford academic AI could go rogue
and become too complex for engineers.

2111
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,330
Oh my God.

2112
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:52,650
Oh my God.

2113
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:53,483
That is it.

2114
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,091
Hey,

2115
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:56,100
what are your thoughts on net neutrality?

2116
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,880
Because I would talking to people
online today about net neutrality.

2117
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:00,480
Yeah.

2118
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,170
I posted something about it that it seems
to me to be one of those ideological

2119
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:07,440
camp issues where if
you are leaning right,

2120
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:10,800
you think that net neutrality is a bad
thing that the market should decide.

2121
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:11,880
If you're leaning left,

2122
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:15,720
you think that there's some regulation
that the government should step in and be

2123
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:18,450
important because you want to
keep people from information.

2124
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:22,740
You don't want to a big corporation to
be able to step in and say someone can or

2125
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:23,560
can't,

2126
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:23,910
uh,

2127
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:27,090
have their program on 18 t or Verizon or,

2128
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,580
I think that from what I've read,

2129
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:32,400
there are six major service providers.

2130
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:32,730
Maybe,

2131
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:37,730
maybe a couple more that that already
smelled a little bit like a monopoly,

2132
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:40,440
but what I think is that if you,

2133
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,310
first of all,

2134
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:42,540
nobody really knows yet,

2135
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:47,870
but I think that the bigger issue becomes
if these companies provide you service

2136
00:54:48,991 --> 00:54:50,010
in your area,

2137
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,210
they could decide to break
it into say to bandwidth,

2138
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:55,920
say could decide you want regular,

2139
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,620
you want regular service
or do you want premium?

2140
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,281
If you want premium,

2141
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:01,150
we're going to pay a little more good.

2142
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:01,741
That's one thing.

2143
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:02,550
They could bring it up.

2144
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,780
If that's the case,

2145
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,460
we'll let the market decide.

2146
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:10,380
Maybe that maybe that creates an opening
for another service provider to come in

2147
00:55:10,381 --> 00:55:10,741
and say,

2148
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,520
we don't do that one
price covers everything.

2149
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:16,440
It's one of the guys on my Instagram
or my Twitter rather had a really good

2150
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:16,920
point.

2151
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,400
He said the real issue that people aren't
talking about is the monopolies that

2152
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,990
these companies have in small areas.

2153
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,320
Yes.

2154
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,700
Like if you're in a certain town,

2155
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,870
like you can only get this
kind of company or you know,

2156
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:26,783
Verizon or,

2157
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,813
that's what I'm saying,

2158
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,770
when you have a company that owns
a certain town and then you know,

2159
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,800
in certain areas is the only
way you can get coverage.

2160
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,160
Do you have to do with this one company,

2161
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,510
then then it becomes a real issue.

2162
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:37,590
And not only does it become an issue,

2163
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:42,450
but the other issue is that now the
real question is if you are a service

2164
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:44,490
provider and you provide,

2165
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:44,970
uh,

2166
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,020
people in this area,

2167
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:46,854
that service,

2168
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,870
if the other service has,

2169
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,950
if you use platforms that the other
service provides and they compete directly

2170
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:54,301
with this,

2171
00:55:54,301 --> 00:55:58,320
with this service block that would
this service have an incentive to,

2172
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:59,250
uh,

2173
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,380
slow block your access to it or whatever.

2174
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:02,430
And that would be an issue.

2175
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:07,790
But my feeling is that we'll find out
very quickly and as long as consumers have

2176
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,070
the ability to go over
to another provider,

2177
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,560
as long as consumers
have the ability to go,

2178
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,390
I don't like the way you do business,

2179
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,051
I want,

2180
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:18,690
but they don't got a
lot of areas becomes the

2181
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,730
terrorists have a license,

2182
00:56:21,731 --> 00:56:23,060
they have a license and a certain,

2183
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:23,480
yeah.

2184
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,800
Certain district consumer
backlash is how you fight that.

2185
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,420
If there's enough consumer
backlash and people go,

2186
00:56:29,421 --> 00:56:32,020
are you just keep the net
neutrality in place and prevent it,

2187
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,630
you know?

2188
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:33,040
Yeah.

2189
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,430
I mean,

2190
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,940
it's just I'm going to have some experts
on to talk about it soon in the future.

2191
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,010
I'm going over all the
data and information,

2192
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:43,200
but I just wanted to get people's
temperature and it's so funny how people,

2193
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:43,570
uh,

2194
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:47,380
get so aggressive and shitty with you
when you just talk about this issue

2195
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,120
because a few people that have had a mute,

2196
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:49,930
I was like,

2197
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:50,763
good luck dude.

2198
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:54,040
Your opinion means shit to me because
you just have to be insulting when

2199
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:55,270
someone's just asking a question.

2200
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:55,840
Right.

2201
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,291
You know this,

2202
00:56:56,291 --> 00:57:00,250
this whole thing is interesting because
there's smart people on both sides of it

2203
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:03,130
and they have compelling arguments
on both sides of it and I don't,

2204
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,540
I don't have an opinion 100%
I leaned more towards Paul.

2205
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:11,210
A lot of people don't yet know how this
this is going to play out because you

2206
00:57:11,211 --> 00:57:11,490
know,

2207
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:12,251
you may say though,

2208
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:17,251
you lean towards what I lean towards
the idea that you have to have some

2209
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:18,334
oversight,

2210
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,390
that you have to have someone who's
looking out who makes sure that these

2211
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:26,200
companies can't fuck you over and
can't prevent you from having access to

2212
00:57:26,201 --> 00:57:27,040
certain information.

2213
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:29,350
Certain sites I lean towards that most.

2214
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:30,640
But the answer that,

2215
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,240
the other question is though that does
the market decide that was going to say

2216
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,040
the other oversight could be,

2217
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,910
I always leaned toward the idea that
the marketplace would be your oversight.

2218
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,190
Let people make their choice,

2219
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:43,390
but they have to have a choice.

2220
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:47,050
Unless you were talking about there
are very few service providers might.

2221
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,130
My question is,

2222
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,850
is there incentive for other people to
come into the service providing space?

2223
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,840
Can they make money?

2224
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:53,440
Uh,

2225
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,160
what are the barriers to
entry and as far as the right.

2226
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,460
And secondly,

2227
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,130
secondly,

2228
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:58,750
um,

2229
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:03,750
is it in these service providers interest
ultimately to make extra cash for such

2230
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:05,044
bad press?

2231
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:05,651
I,

2232
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:08,620
you may see nothing happened as a result,

2233
00:58:08,621 --> 00:58:10,850
but I liked the idea that
the marketplace that,

2234
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:14,230
that consumers have a choice and
when consumers have a choice,

2235
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,430
they're going to go with what
works the best for group B.

2236
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:17,410
I do too.

2237
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:21,340
But I do believe that it's
entirely possible that large
corporations could have

2238
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,230
monopoly real influence over the way
our culture has access to information.

2239
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,210
I think I agree that should be stopped.

2240
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:32,470
But I also think that these fucking
government organizations almost all suck.

2241
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:36,780
They're all filled with unmotivated
people who suck at their job and the

2242
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,450
bureaucracy and the fucking red
tape gets deeper and thicker.

2243
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:45,220
I think almost every government
organization that does any task is flawed.

2244
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:49,300
And so the idea that we should have
government take care of these issues.

2245
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,470
I have a problem with that too.

2246
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:51,760
Missy both sides of it.

2247
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:52,840
I see this side too.

2248
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:55,210
There's another dark side
of the marketplace though I,

2249
00:58:55,211 --> 00:58:55,571
you know,

2250
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:57,820
I think the news nowadays,

2251
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:58,420
you know,

2252
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,540
makes a lot of money on clickbait and,

2253
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,540
and so you,

2254
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,160
you now have companies,

2255
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:07,930
whether it's the Huffington Post or CNN
or whatever who are less interested,

2256
00:59:07,931 --> 00:59:08,441
it seems,

2257
00:59:08,441 --> 00:59:12,910
and objective reporting of the news
and way more interested in generating

2258
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:13,960
clicks.

2259
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,120
Did you seal fucking Newsweek,

2260
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,191
title the,

2261
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:21,350
that they put out about Trump and
the Nazis like stealing Christmas?

2262
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,541
Did you see that?

2263
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:23,030
There you go.

2264
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,721
That's a classic.

2265
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:24,650
See if you can find it.

2266
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,280
What is that?

2267
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,240
I'm already intrigued.

2268
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,930
You know the news,

2269
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,050
the world is such a polygamy infotainment,

2270
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:32,480
right?

2271
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,410
That's a tragedy.

2272
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,370
Newsweek,

2273
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,300
which will,

2274
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,010
you would always say they have to compete.

2275
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:37,940
There are met.

2276
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,750
They have to compete.

2277
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,321
That's what it is.

2278
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:39,840
You have to can be,

2279
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,270
but you'd always think they're measured.

2280
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:42,050
They're intelligent.

2281
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,600
This is Newsweek disrespected when,

2282
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:45,700
when Chris Rock the DEP,

2283
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,150
when Chris was working on a bit how
Trump and the Nazi stole Christmas to

2284
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,410
promote white nationalism.

2285
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:52,700
Hey,

2286
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,380
fucking slow down.

2287
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:55,243
Yeah.

2288
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,610
This is just his hair.

2289
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:59,300
You're going to get Caitlyn
Jenner elected president.

2290
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:00,200
If you keep this shit up.

2291
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:00,490
Exactly.

2292
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,270
Like you have to understand
what's happening here.

2293
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,440
People are gonna go nuts.

2294
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:07,670
The media's disapproval rating the
opposite according to some halls,

2295
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:08,031
the media,

2296
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:11,030
his approval rating is in the single
digits and I think they deserve it.

2297
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,343
I really do.

2298
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,030
I um,

2299
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,940
am not nearly as cynical
as a lot of people,

2300
01:00:16,941 --> 01:00:19,340
but as I get older and I
see how her responsible,

2301
01:00:19,341 --> 01:00:22,370
a lot of the news is how much
money there is to be made by just,

2302
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,180
just hinting or sort of,

2303
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:26,480
you know,

2304
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,120
associating somebodies name with
something kind of volatile short

2305
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:33,873
story.

2306
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,780
A lot of their environment,

2307
01:00:35,781 --> 01:00:37,560
like they're dealing with
what gets a response.

2308
01:00:37,561 --> 01:00:38,630
And when it gets clicks,

2309
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:39,790
so all good questions.

2310
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,110
Societies are the ones who
are telling them to do this.

2311
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,420
They're not just making this shit up.

2312
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,030
That's right.

2313
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:44,480
They're like,

2314
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:44,661
well,

2315
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:45,110
if we,

2316
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:45,950
if we say Trump,

2317
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,270
the Nazi stole Christmas,

2318
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:48,570
how many clicks are we going to get?

2319
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,011
See,

2320
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:51,500
but this is what they're doing
is they're being more exclusive.

2321
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:51,891
Hold on.

2322
01:00:51,891 --> 01:00:53,600
They're being disingenuous
here in this article.

2323
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:56,750
Scroll up a little bit because
here's one of the things it says.

2324
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,560
It says,

2325
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,600
Donald Trump wants America to thank,

2326
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:01,220
he reinvented Christmas.

2327
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,410
We can say merry Christmas again.

2328
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:04,610
He has said on numerous occasions,

2329
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:06,380
both during the campaign and
president and presidency,

2330
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:08,480
Christmases back better than ever before.

2331
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,550
He told supporters month
before the Christmas season,

2332
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:15,551
fuck he is doing what a guy who's very
persuasive does to try to get people in

2333
01:01:16,221 --> 01:01:16,881
his camp.

2334
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:17,541
He's a falcon.

2335
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,190
Politicians got a sense of humor,

2336
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:20,300
but it's not even true.

2337
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:20,760
But the what,

2338
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,141
what,

2339
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:25,160
what he's doing here is not even true
because he in the past did a lot of tweets

2340
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:26,750
about happy holidays.

2341
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:27,051
Happy.

2342
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:31,190
I like people pulled them up that he
used to say happy holidays all the time,

2343
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:36,191
like really recently was tweeting happy
holidays and then the idea that Obama

2344
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:38,700
never said merry Christmas
is 100% horseshit.

2345
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,780
There's a whole video of
Obama saying merry Christmas.

2346
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,760
Merry Christmas is over and over again.

2347
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,043
Nothing wrong with it.

2348
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:48,050
This idea is he's trying to sell
people on the idea that you will,

2349
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:53,110
your Christian values have been suppressed
by this mediocre left wing government

2350
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,730
and he stepping in here to
make America great again.

2351
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:56,564
It's all a hustle,

2352
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:01,370
but it's not white nationalists
and Nazis like you can't say Nazis.

2353
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:06,371
The problem is when you say that you
leave the word Nazi loses its fucking

2354
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:06,890
meaning.

2355
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:07,140
Yeah.

2356
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,660
They're irresponsible journalists.

2357
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:09,411
They're not journalists.

2358
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:10,400
They're irresponsible.

2359
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:10,581
Yeah.

2360
01:02:10,581 --> 01:02:14,150
What he's doing is he's
being a fucking politician.

2361
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:15,200
He's being a weasel.

2362
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,570
He's trying to pretend
that Christmas was never,

2363
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:17,871
we never,

2364
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:18,980
we never had Christmas before.

2365
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,910
We're going to have Christmas
now and all the dopes,

2366
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,753
all the yokels,

2367
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:22,913
but

2368
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:25,863
you know,

2369
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,990
this guy's out there with
make America great again.

2370
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:28,650
Tattoos.

2371
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,730
You just understand this.

2372
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:30,390
This is real.

2373
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,920
Like there's people with its red hat,

2374
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:35,820
tattoos that say make America great
again on there's dummies in every fucking

2375
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:36,720
quadrant in this earth.

2376
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:37,554
But do you know,

2377
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:38,680
I have to say that the,

2378
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,470
the mainstream media,

2379
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,670
and I'm,

2380
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,320
I know I had never been a fan of Trump,

2381
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,070
but the way they treat him with this
kind of stuff that I constantly hear this

2382
01:02:47,071 --> 01:02:47,851
petty shit.

2383
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,050
The way it drinks water and stuff.

2384
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:50,790
It's made me funny.

2385
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:52,320
That made me more sympathetic.

2386
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,120
When you drink water,

2387
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:55,703
drink water like this.

2388
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:59,300
I got a strange guy,

2389
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:00,643
12 guys.

2390
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:02,971
It's fucking,

2391
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:06,600
when you drink 12 diet cokes might
be true or I don't believe it.

2392
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,230
You know,

2393
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,150
I don't know what to believe anymore.

2394
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:08,910
That's the other problem.

2395
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:12,840
There's another bunch of it cause he
quotes a series of quotes from him from

2396
01:03:12,841 --> 01:03:13,950
back in the day saying,

2397
01:03:13,951 --> 01:03:16,020
why would you drink that
coke to drink diet coke?

2398
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:18,630
People drink diet coke or all
saw fat diet coke makes you fat.

2399
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:19,464
It's been proven.

2400
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:20,730
There's a whole series of tweets.

2401
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,280
Like he might've just forgot he
made those tweets while he strapped.

2402
01:03:23,281 --> 01:03:25,420
Just doesn't give a fuck in great shape.

2403
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,100
Yeah.

2404
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:26,940
But I think that,

2405
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:27,863
you know,

2406
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:28,793
first of all,

2407
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,940
he as a president,

2408
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:30,930
here's a weird one,

2409
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,260
there was a terror attack that was
thwarted by the FBI in San Francisco.

2410
01:03:34,261 --> 01:03:37,950
You didn't hear a Goddamn peep about it
because he's against the FBI because of

2411
01:03:37,951 --> 01:03:38,101
this,

2412
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:39,630
all this investigation shit.

2413
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,610
So the president in the
United States didn't,

2414
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:44,310
it didn't like congratulate the FBI,

2415
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:47,010
didn't tell the American people
that the FBI had done a great job.

2416
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:48,740
I know,

2417
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:49,800
I know about the terrorist attack.

2418
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:54,060
I read boarded a legitimate terrorists
attacked and this is all this whole make

2419
01:03:54,061 --> 01:03:54,721
America great again.

2420
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:54,961
Stuff,

2421
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:55,360
right?

2422
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,460
You want to stop the terrorists.

2423
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,710
He is a political point.

2424
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:04,100
He avoided this terrible and he arrests
man suspected applauding isis inspired

2425
01:04:06,661 --> 01:04:11,490
Christmas terror attack in San Francisco
and everyone at times it was a marine

2426
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:12,050
who would,

2427
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:12,420
you know,

2428
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,710
started going crazy.

2429
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,220
Yeah.

2430
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:14,491
Yeah.

2431
01:04:14,491 --> 01:04:16,400
Well it's just very handy.

2432
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,000
It's very crazy arguments.

2433
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,490
And how about he started,

2434
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:19,860
they give,

2435
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,220
they come,

2436
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,001
he started to like,

2437
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:24,990
like isis posts on Facebook and then
he reached out to isis and went,

2438
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:25,531
hey,

2439
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:27,030
look in to complete this mission.

2440
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:29,850
How do I get ahold of
the guns and bullets?

2441
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,350
Nicest like homeboy,

2442
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,580
if you have to ask for the gear,

2443
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:34,110
might not be for you.

2444
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,173
Like what the fuck?

2445
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:36,223
They're dumb.

2446
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:41,460
Meet us on the dock where
the asshole get out of here,

2447
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,294
man.

2448
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:44,400
Lag on your truck as you pull up.

2449
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,650
Make it super obvious.

2450
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:47,191
Every time.

2451
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:50,010
I've been pier 39 and I've been there
every time I go to San Francisco,

2452
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,420
I always think that I'm always like,

2453
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,283
I don't think like that.

2454
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,040
A lot of people though in making this
comment on why did the president not

2455
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:57,070
discuss this like,

2456
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:59,370
well this is something that like
when you address the nation,

2457
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,360
you have to talk about it.

2458
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:03,990
And even if he's in some sort of a
squabble with one aspect of the FBI,

2459
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,780
you have to recognize that
they did their job here.

2460
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,850
This is why they're great job.

2461
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,180
Yeah,

2462
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,380
and this is why they're important.

2463
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Like the literally protected American
lives and he's not mentioning it bullshit

2464
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:18,010
that they do when they're
saying things like

2465
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,280
how Trump stole Christmas with
white nationalists and Nazis,

2466
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:22,000
that petty,

2467
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,440
that kind of petty shit
and forces his petty.

2468
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,030
Yup.

2469
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:25,290
Yup.

2470
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,380
It's in a way of real news.

2471
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,980
[inaudible] and they go at it.

2472
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,670
They go at each other back and
forth and nothing gets done.

2473
01:05:30,671 --> 01:05:32,770
So in these to grow the fuck up
and it should be the president,

2474
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:33,980
but he woos weak.

2475
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,320
She needs to grow the fuck up too.

2476
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:36,670
You can't say things like that.

2477
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:37,504
That's silly.

2478
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:41,410
We should be able to rely
on the mainstream news,

2479
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:44,830
and I know I'm going to get a lot
emails about the main Eddie Bravo who's

2480
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:45,550
calling you right now,

2481
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:46,690
but we should be a little,

2482
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,810
we should rely on them to
at least report the facts,

2483
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,000
at least objective facts.

2484
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:53,350
That was the whole point of journalism.

2485
01:05:53,351 --> 01:05:55,120
They were the fourth estate they keep,

2486
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:56,560
they keep power in line,

2487
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,221
they hold,

2488
01:05:57,221 --> 01:05:58,420
they speak truth to power.

2489
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,530
That's the whole idea.

2490
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,400
In a democracy,

2491
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:01,930
you need a free press,

2492
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,793
you need,

2493
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,590
but now with money ratings,

2494
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:06,790
it has corrupted.

2495
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,170
While there's also many grants,

2496
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,330
the the fucking Internet man,

2497
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:13,570
the Internet came along and pretty
much anybody can be a new source now.

2498
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,400
Anybody can be a Hashtag.

2499
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:15,881
Journalists,

2500
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:17,410
there's a lot of fluctuation the game up,

2501
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:18,010
you know,

2502
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:18,970
change the game up.

2503
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,000
Credentials to get,

2504
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:20,360
well,

2505
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,550
I spread rumors.

2506
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:22,660
A PDF pages.

2507
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:23,800
I was saying this the other day,

2508
01:06:23,801 --> 01:06:25,300
I was trying to remember
writing something about this,

2509
01:06:25,301 --> 01:06:28,600
but like the idea that
you in social media,

2510
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,770
if you,

2511
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:33,190
we all have moments where we do some
crazy shit where we say stuff out loud

2512
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:34,960
that's like politically
incorrect and we say,

2513
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:35,291
well,

2514
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:39,040
we just behave in a way
that could make you crazy,

2515
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:39,430
right?

2516
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:39,910
Yeah.

2517
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,940
Like my dog ran into
my knee the other day.

2518
01:06:42,941 --> 01:06:43,240
I was like,

2519
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:43,450
ah,

2520
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:44,320
fuck it hurt.

2521
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:46,090
And I instinctively kicked out of,

2522
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:46,311
I'm like,

2523
01:06:46,311 --> 01:06:48,880
I was just like fucking and
I kick and I missed her.

2524
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:49,841
But dude,

2525
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:53,050
it looked like I tried to kick my fucking
dog and the ribs because by the way,

2526
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:57,010
in that mid split second I was trying to
kick my dog who I love very much in the

2527
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:57,460
restaurant.

2528
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,220
She hit my knee was like,

2529
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:58,660
ah,

2530
01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,350
my actions.

2531
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,630
Anything wrong with giving
your dog a little knee taps?

2532
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,230
Correct.

2533
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,810
If somebody caught that on camera,

2534
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,080
so I'm a little shove,

2535
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,130
somebody caught that on camera.

2536
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,110
Now on a dog in the ribs,

2537
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:08,470
this,

2538
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:10,480
I'm just saying somebody
it caught on the camera,

2539
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:12,610
it would have been Brian
count and if I was,

2540
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,330
if I was famous,

2541
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:13,870
they'd be like,

2542
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,010
say I was a politician or whatever.

2543
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,143
I'm fun.

2544
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:16,930
I'm done.

2545
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:17,731
I'm the dog cat.

2546
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:18,050
True,

2547
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:18,883
right.

2548
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:20,450
That's a comedic example.

2549
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:20,930
Shit.

2550
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:21,700
Yeah,

2551
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,260
but I'm saying that nowadays,

2552
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:24,880
and I was thinking about this nowadays,

2553
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,440
anything that you do,

2554
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:27,640
if you're having a moment,

2555
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,650
if you're having a moan
or you make a mistake,

2556
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:30,520
describe a moment.

2557
01:07:30,521 --> 01:07:30,820
Dopey.

2558
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:31,960
I thought he got to be careful with,

2559
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,280
oh,

2560
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,040
I'll tell you,

2561
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,030
you're making a mistake.

2562
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:34,870
I don't know.

2563
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:35,703
It could be,

2564
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:36,641
give me an example.

2565
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:41,140
It could be you got caught at a strip
club you were making out with a girl

2566
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:41,801
behind a dumpster,

2567
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:42,281
but you're married,

2568
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:42,970
whatever it might be.

2569
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:46,030
There are a lot of examples where
everybody's fuckups like my buddy,

2570
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:47,930
my buddy saying like Kevin Hart situation,

2571
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:48,610
it's fine.

2572
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:49,030
Hold on.

2573
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:49,121
Well,

2574
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:49,320
my,

2575
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,110
my buddy,

2576
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,880
my buddy who owns buildings,

2577
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:53,020
he gets sued all the time.

2578
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:57,010
And what he does is he'll just hire a
private investigator and he h he just

2579
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:59,830
follows the dude and he'll just
follow the poor over sooner.

2580
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:00,400
Yeah.

2581
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:00,680
And,

2582
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,061
and I go,

2583
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:01,481
why did he do that?

2584
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:02,230
He goes,

2585
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:02,591
well,

2586
01:08:02,591 --> 01:08:05,980
because everybody he's ever followed,

2587
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:06,670
he goes,

2588
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:10,480
everybody is always fucking up
in one aspect of their life.

2589
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:10,600
Well,

2590
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,710
especially someone with sleazy who
tries these like illegitimate lawsuits.

2591
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:14,470
Yes.

2592
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,190
He always finds

2593
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,270
evidence that they're just,

2594
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:18,320
they're doing something.

2595
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,461
I got a girlfriend,

2596
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:20,091
I've got a boyfriend.

2597
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:20,230
What?

2598
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,140
It's always something,

2599
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:21,330
right?

2600
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,163
You're fine.

2601
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:24,440
So let's say in a hypothetical situation,

2602
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:25,670
you were cheating on ref came out.

2603
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,720
Here's the larger fine.

2604
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:27,740
The larger point is this.

2605
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,520
I was thinking about like
how I was taking Gandhi,

2606
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:32,750
Martin Luther King,

2607
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:33,883
Hemingway,

2608
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,330
Picasso and Einstein,

2609
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,100
all dirt bags,

2610
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:37,970
all known,

2611
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:38,751
known,

2612
01:08:38,751 --> 01:08:42,460
philanderers known to cheat on
their wives just known there.

2613
01:08:42,461 --> 01:08:42,921
They're poor.

2614
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:43,011
Well,

2615
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:43,580
I mean,

2616
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,250
and just real real ladies,

2617
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:48,170
men and and beyond.

2618
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:48,501
Well,

2619
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:49,334
how about Kennedy?

2620
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,190
Uh,

2621
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:50,400
you know,

2622
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,950
everybody wants to keep talking about
how Bill Clinton got caught with Monica

2623
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:54,470
Lewinsky to,

2624
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:55,460
there was a woman who came out,

2625
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:57,740
it was like one of the aides
and the White House who's,

2626
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:58,451
she was abused.

2627
01:08:58,451 --> 01:09:01,840
She was 19 can be made her
suck his Dick sucker from gay.

2628
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,070
Fuck everybody.

2629
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,410
And so what I'm saying is that in the day,

2630
01:09:06,411 --> 01:09:11,070
in the days of social media now we would
have dilated on that and we haven't

2631
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,570
looked at that.

2632
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:13,060
He couldn't have acted like that.

2633
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:14,180
What we want to focus on,

2634
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:15,200
because with those men,

2635
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:16,400
let's just take those men,

2636
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:20,720
they could have been discredited and
cut out at the knees depending on when

2637
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:21,290
that,

2638
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,060
that activity was exposed.

2639
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:23,421
Okay,

2640
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:23,761
man,

2641
01:09:23,761 --> 01:09:27,110
he's talking about technology could have
undermined everything they're working,

2642
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:27,650
but hold on.

2643
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:32,600
Isn't it possible that we need to have
a more realistic understanding of what a

2644
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:33,201
human being?

2645
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:33,770
Yes.

2646
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:37,910
And then seeing all these flaws in a
person and then getting past that is maybe

2647
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:40,010
the way to go the way the Europeans do.

2648
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:43,730
But our problem is that we're dealing
with this old model where everybody was

2649
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:46,160
like some fucking Cary
grant dude in a movie.

2650
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,420
And w you know,

2651
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:48,740
the good guys wore white hats.

2652
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:50,000
The bad guys wear black hats.

2653
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:50,781
And it's not realistic.

2654
01:09:50,781 --> 01:09:51,470
It's not realistic.

2655
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,410
That's not Merrill came with our products,

2656
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,110
but isn't it?

2657
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,220
Isn't it an American?

2658
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:59,000
Because it hasn't been exposed and we
don't have a new realization of what human

2659
01:09:59,001 --> 01:09:59,690
beings are.

2660
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:04,690
And so isn't all of this excruciating
detailed information that comes out about

2661
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:09,560
anybody that's seeking power isn't
ultimately like a good thing to see.

2662
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:09,830
Like,

2663
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:10,220
oh,

2664
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,090
he's like me.

2665
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,050
I know I'm fuck up.

2666
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:12,741
He's like me.

2667
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:13,610
Oh that guys like me too.

2668
01:10:13,611 --> 01:10:15,290
So instead of thinking
that there's some person,

2669
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:17,540
some Dalai Lama guy who
was going to come save us,

2670
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,520
the one guy on the planet
doesn't have any vices.

2671
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,090
Yeah.

2672
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,080
Instead of that,

2673
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,870
maybe we should have a more
honest interpretation of
what it means to be human

2674
01:10:24,871 --> 01:10:27,410
and passionate and understanding
that sometimes we're,

2675
01:10:27,411 --> 01:10:27,860
we're,

2676
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:28,220
you know,

2677
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,170
Jordan Peterson said something
fucking amazing to me.

2678
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:30,830
He goes,

2679
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:31,161
he goes,

2680
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:32,600
we're ruled by different gods.

2681
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:33,840
Depending on the moment,

2682
01:10:33,841 --> 01:10:34,580
the time of day,

2683
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,320
we're ruled by the God of sex,

2684
01:10:36,321 --> 01:10:38,030
the God of a jealousy,

2685
01:10:38,031 --> 01:10:38,870
that God of anger,

2686
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:40,070
the god of resentment.

2687
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,600
It just depends on the moment,

2688
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:43,610
which is his argument
for an overreaching God.

2689
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,130
But I want my president
to be better than me.

2690
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:46,701
You know what I'm saying?

2691
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:47,910
I don't want him to see fancy.

2692
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:48,210
Yeah.

2693
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:51,260
Held to the higher standards are
going to be better than you anyway.

2694
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:53,390
There's just because they have
the same flaws that you have,

2695
01:10:53,391 --> 01:10:55,970
doesn't mean they're not better at you
than running the government running the

2696
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:56,210
golf.

2697
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,700
If he has a drug addiction,

2698
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:58,580
he's fucking hookers,

2699
01:10:58,581 --> 01:10:59,050
not sharp.

2700
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:00,650
And I don't want to run in my country.

2701
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:02,360
And you'll be held can
be the mayor of Toronto.

2702
01:11:02,361 --> 01:11:05,690
Like Rob Ford did a great job while
I was mayor of Toronto Smoking crack.

2703
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:06,600
Clinton wasn't bad either.

2704
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:08,631
Exactly.

2705
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:09,550
I just think we need,

2706
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:14,520
we need a more nuance point of view of
what human are and I think we've lost it.

2707
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:15,960
I think we're very Americans,

2708
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,680
but I think it's the think people
are being held accountable more.

2709
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:19,321
There'll be like,

2710
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:21,870
there's actual like
bad dudes who are like,

2711
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:22,310
God,

2712
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:22,771
it's out.

2713
01:11:22,771 --> 01:11:23,150
Yes,

2714
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:23,520
yes.

2715
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,440
[inaudible] and bad.

2716
01:11:25,441 --> 01:11:26,430
There's good and bad to this,

2717
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,151
but I'm just,

2718
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:30,330
I just hope that we come back around
and the fact that human beings are

2719
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:31,160
complicated,

2720
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,730
that we're all fucking up that,

2721
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:35,310
that it just because I fucked them in
this atmospheric doesn't mean I'm a bad

2722
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:36,570
person all the way through it.

2723
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:38,820
Trevor Noah said something
that that was interesting.

2724
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:39,570
He said,

2725
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:39,940
I want,

2726
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:42,600
I don't understand about Americans
is how you can't be both things.

2727
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:43,830
Why do you have to be
one thing or another?

2728
01:11:43,831 --> 01:11:45,120
You've got to have a
black hat or white hat.

2729
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:45,961
Can you be,

2730
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:49,830
is it possible to sympathize
with the black lives matter?

2731
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:51,270
And also be pro cop.

2732
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:51,900
Can you,

2733
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,020
can you have both
hospital and picks teams?

2734
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,850
We've had to pick teams teams in a way.

2735
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,280
Well it can't be calming
to pick teams for sure.

2736
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,840
And so it's an instinct that we have.

2737
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,960
I think we're getting better and
understanding what a human being is.

2738
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,430
And I think to equate Harvey Weinstein
with finding flaws and politicians is

2739
01:12:08,431 --> 01:12:09,061
very different.

2740
01:12:09,061 --> 01:12:09,390
I agree.

2741
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:10,410
Because what he's doing,

2742
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,010
what he was doing was
essentially he was not just that,

2743
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:14,820
he was,

2744
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,653
he was like,

2745
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,140
that was part of how we
engineered his business.

2746
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:23,630
He engineered his business to like feed
his sexual harassing and sexual assault

2747
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:27,170
appetites a piece of shit that's going on,

2748
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,190
another contract that's going on.

2749
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,930
I think in other corporations,

2750
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:32,130
just not an entertainment.

2751
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:33,030
So that,

2752
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,510
I think the way he did it,

2753
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,690
the girls had to fuck them to get parts.

2754
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:36,900
Yeah.

2755
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:37,920
I think he's an outlier.

2756
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:38,291
I think he's,

2757
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,124
I don't think so.

2758
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,170
I think he's an outlier.

2759
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,033
I don't think so.

2760
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,210
I think when it comes power and
there's print and there's pretty girls,

2761
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:47,340
I think men are going to abuse that power.

2762
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:47,610
Right.

2763
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:48,480
But Duane levels.

2764
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:50,881
Some guys,

2765
01:12:50,881 --> 01:12:54,480
if you think Harvey Weinstein in that
position of power is the only guy to do

2766
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:55,280
that to that level.

2767
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,230
Your credit may be our arts
women are also drawn to power.

2768
01:12:58,231 --> 01:12:58,471
Right?

2769
01:12:58,471 --> 01:13:01,590
So I like how you guys try each other be
like you're fucking 15 year old kids in

2770
01:13:01,591 --> 01:13:01,951
Brooklyn.

2771
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,784
You have to work

2772
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:04,890
to do,

2773
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:09,890
because we're a couple of cuties C and
I agree it's scary but I think it's a

2774
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:11,610
witch hunt only for witches,

2775
01:13:11,611 --> 01:13:11,950
man.

2776
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:12,390
I've,

2777
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,260
it doesn't bother them.

2778
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:13,471
No,

2779
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:15,130
you can't say these guys get turned down.

2780
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:19,290
You can't say that because of witch
hunt is that the witch hunt is also like

2781
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,030
based on hearsay and
accusation and not proof.

2782
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:22,560
So you,

2783
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,240
you have to have due process for some.

2784
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:24,600
Yes.

2785
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,100
For some you have to have due process.

2786
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:26,460
That's all.

2787
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:31,230
W We all know that we live now at a
time when just accusations can ruin your

2788
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:32,064
entire career.

2789
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:32,330
Well,

2790
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:35,460
I mean I think part of Appleby
whose career has it ruined?

2791
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:36,294
That wasn't true.

2792
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:37,920
I don't nursing Keillor.

2793
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,320
Garrison Keillor is a good example.

2794
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,740
Garrison Keillor's the best example,

2795
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:43,170
and he's a guy like his entire
career has been known as this,

2796
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:44,720
like Super Nice Guy Consoles.

2797
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:46,020
A woman hugs her,

2798
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:46,741
his hand goes down,

2799
01:13:46,741 --> 01:13:48,930
her shirt on her back,

2800
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:49,830
she,

2801
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:50,790
she pulls back,

2802
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:51,481
he apologized,

2803
01:13:51,481 --> 01:13:54,450
he sends her a letter
apologizing and she accepts it.

2804
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:54,570
They,

2805
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:56,310
they stay friends and
then she goes public,

2806
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:56,551
whether it,

2807
01:13:56,551 --> 01:13:57,880
when all this meat to stuff comes out,

2808
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,790
just feels compiled.

2809
01:13:59,210 --> 01:13:59,640
It's,

2810
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,120
yeah,

2811
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:00,571
she'd done,

2812
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:00,841
didn't get,

2813
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:01,080
just get,

2814
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:01,860
just get fired.

2815
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,090
They changed the name of his thing.

2816
01:14:03,091 --> 01:14:06,780
I'll Franken Franken admitted he did
some shit that he shouldn't have done and

2817
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:08,680
grab some butts out.

2818
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,061
Yeah.

2819
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:10,920
I'll have to almost a better point.

2820
01:14:10,921 --> 01:14:13,150
I how I think he's a farmer.

2821
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:14,523
He's a bad guy either.

2822
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:16,443
Yeah.

2823
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:19,720
It's a good example for a
while and then he couldn't,

2824
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,510
and all the Democrats now or have in the,

2825
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,740
in in Minnesota are
having second thoughts.

2826
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:24,640
He shouldn't retire.

2827
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:24,941
Hey,

2828
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:26,050
you fucking guys.

2829
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:28,180
You'd mobbed up on Twitter.

2830
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:29,800
Like a little proportion.

2831
01:14:29,801 --> 01:14:30,511
We need to have,

2832
01:14:30,511 --> 01:14:31,440
as we though you're,

2833
01:14:31,441 --> 01:14:35,350
you're talking about such a large number
of some national marred up because it's

2834
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:36,310
naturally in there.

2835
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,920
They're fucking behavior pattern.

2836
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:41,710
There needs to be a national
narrative on where the line is too.

2837
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,630
A lot of people don't know whether
like I knew where the line is,

2838
01:14:43,631 --> 01:14:44,740
you know where the line is to me,

2839
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:48,910
like if you don't want something and
I'm humiliating you are embarrassing you

2840
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:49,500
and,

2841
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:53,350
and if I did that because I'm an idiot
then then I got to make amends and figure

2842
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:54,130
out what I did wrong.

2843
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,150
You're 100% right,

2844
01:14:55,151 --> 01:14:57,520
but we have to understand what you're
saying when you're saying the line.

2845
01:14:57,550 --> 01:15:01,510
The line includes free speech and free
speech for 320 million people is going to

2846
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:04,900
leave an exorbitant amount of human beings
that feel like they should gang up on

2847
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:05,531
everybody.

2848
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:08,590
Anytime something goes sideways and
that's what you see and that's what you

2849
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:08,951
feel.

2850
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:12,790
And that had been telling media companies
react to that because they don't want

2851
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:13,391
blow back.

2852
01:15:13,391 --> 01:15:14,620
They don't want boycotts.

2853
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,980
They step in and fire pieces of the,

2854
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:16,870
we shouldn't get fired.

2855
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,000
But I think in the workplace it's scary.

2856
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:19,751
Even for me,

2857
01:15:19,751 --> 01:15:20,250
there was a,

2858
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:23,860
the a female cup the other night where
in the lead up and you know I'm into

2859
01:15:23,861 --> 01:15:25,570
fashion and what was too gay with it,

2860
01:15:25,571 --> 01:15:27,070
but she had this dope coat on.

2861
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:27,904
I thought about,

2862
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:29,340
I said something about a cutlet.

2863
01:15:29,341 --> 01:15:29,620
I thought,

2864
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,940
ah fuck was that too?

2865
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,490
Like it was like two Ford
with her about a coat.

2866
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:34,450
Like I'm scared of it.

2867
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:35,990
You gotta be careful how it's,

2868
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:38,590
there's a male in the room.

2869
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:38,951
And I was like,

2870
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:39,131
dude,

2871
01:15:39,131 --> 01:15:40,030
where'd you get that coat from?

2872
01:15:40,031 --> 01:15:40,864
We're talking about coats.

2873
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:43,260
And I saw hers and then she
was about to go onstage.

2874
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,163
I was like,

2875
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,161
I love your coat.

2876
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:45,994
That coat is dope.

2877
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,650
And I grabbed her arm.

2878
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:47,950
I was like,

2879
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,220
oh she can,

2880
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,330
she gonna like blast up
like fucked up though.

2881
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,700
You can.

2882
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,320
And I thought,

2883
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,780
oh well it depends cause your intentions,

2884
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:57,040
your intentions are only like,

2885
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,800
you really do love fashion and
you see a really nice coat.

2886
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:00,040
You're like,

2887
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:00,340
Ooh,

2888
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,210
that is nice.

2889
01:16:01,211 --> 01:16:03,550
Like you really like the way
I would look at a nice car.

2890
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:04,151
Wait.

2891
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:04,541
What about,

2892
01:16:04,541 --> 01:16:06,610
what about if a woman's
beautiful and I go,

2893
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,713
you are.

2894
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:09,850
You are fucking Europe.

2895
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:11,623
Can't do that.

2896
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:12,191
Why not?

2897
01:16:12,191 --> 01:16:13,300
Because the way you do it,

2898
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:14,060
the way you do it,

2899
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:14,221
you,

2900
01:16:14,221 --> 01:16:14,411
you,

2901
01:16:14,411 --> 01:16:15,720
you started grabbing your

2902
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:18,123
crotch.

2903
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:18,963
Touch them.

2904
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,980
She wears pants.

2905
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,400
You take the shape of the letter
c and you started giant cashier.

2906
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,011
That's weird.

2907
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:28,000
Why do you think that's weird?

2908
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,890
Cause it's my sister.

2909
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:30,880
I'd want to punch in the face

2910
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,360
about it in the workplace too.

2911
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:35,200
Like you can't if the,

2912
01:16:35,201 --> 01:16:36,280
if the girl was a pretty dress,

2913
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,990
I saw a comic tweet out,

2914
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,220
can't cantor girl we're addressed
without being fucking complimented on it.

2915
01:16:42,221 --> 01:16:43,870
I'm like fuck man.

2916
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,890
Without being complimented.

2917
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,550
What do you mean like can't we just
dress up and you can't say a word like

2918
01:16:48,551 --> 01:16:49,450
you'll see guys saying hey,

2919
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:50,240
nice tie.

2920
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,990
Like can't women come into the
office and not get remarks?

2921
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:55,330
Like fuck that's the
world we're living in man.

2922
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:56,710
You can't say man you look great today.

2923
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:56,980
I said,

2924
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,700
we look good just to,

2925
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:02,020
they're confusing this you what you're
saying is can't a woman come into the

2926
01:17:02,021 --> 01:17:03,700
office and get remarks,

2927
01:17:03,701 --> 01:17:06,220
get positive remarks and it be a good kit.

2928
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:06,850
No pause.

2929
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:07,360
Like Kik,

2930
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:07,750
Kik,

2931
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,011
Kik,

2932
01:17:08,011 --> 01:17:08,290
demand,

2933
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,750
not say anything about a woman the
way she looks in the office place.

2934
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:13,160
Can't she just be another,

2935
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,360
a woman was asking.

2936
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:14,631
Yeah,

2937
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:15,380
warming goes can't,

2938
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,110
can you guys just not common way?

2939
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:17,870
Yes.

2940
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:18,291
Oh,

2941
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:19,124
a woman.

2942
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:20,480
Be a man.

2943
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:22,940
You want to compliment somebody.

2944
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:23,370
There's,

2945
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,920
there's also the reality,

2946
01:17:24,921 --> 01:17:26,720
and this is something that I've
been talking about in my act,

2947
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:26,990
a law.

2948
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:31,990
There's a reality of the way women are
allowed to dress both on television and

2949
01:17:32,301 --> 01:17:37,301
in real life in office situations where
they expose enormous swats of skin,

2950
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,200
which men are not.

2951
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:43,890
If men in the office were wearing skirts
and you could see their toes and they

2952
01:17:43,891 --> 01:17:46,040
had sleeveless shirts and this is common,

2953
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:49,400
this is commonplace and there's
nothing wrong with it and is nothing

2954
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:50,270
inappropriate about it.

2955
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:50,750
And I'm not,

2956
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,270
I'm not commenting on
it like criticizing it,

2957
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,880
but the reality of the way
women are allowed to dress.

2958
01:17:55,881 --> 01:17:58,130
Like if you watch Megan
Kelly on television,

2959
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:58,851
she's,

2960
01:17:58,851 --> 01:18:01,490
especially during the Fox News
days when she's the Ice Princess,

2961
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:05,600
she wore these very small dresses that
looked like she was going out for a hot

2962
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,433
night on the town.

2963
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:06,930
Jamie,

2964
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:07,820
bring that up for a sec.

2965
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:08,800
It's not a bad thing man.

2966
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,440
There's,

2967
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,050
there's visionaries that
just show women on Fox News,

2968
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:15,890
criss crossing and uncrossing their
legs and then dangling there shoes off

2969
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:16,763
there.

2970
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:20,810
Check out the weather girls in Latin
America there's weather than La son

2971
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:21,620
everywhere.

2972
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,371
So girls,

2973
01:18:22,371 --> 01:18:26,360
the girls that dress like that should
be allowed address any fucking way they

2974
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:26,930
want.

2975
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:31,550
But there is a reality of the way they're
dressing that is way more sexually

2976
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:35,960
suggestive than anything that a man is
allowed to where there's not a sexual

2977
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,820
equality when it comes to wardrobe,

2978
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,800
when it comes to wardrobe and an office,

2979
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,030
if every woman dress like Barbara Walters
in the 1980s more fucking pants suit

2980
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:44,721
and you know,

2981
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:48,020
had like one of those big collars
on and shit like dress like Ellen,

2982
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,480
like every woman was like
Ellen when she hosts her shit.

2983
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,590
This is why all of that
should be in Berkus.

2984
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,331
But that is,

2985
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:54,410
but that outfit,

2986
01:18:54,411 --> 01:18:57,980
that Ellen outfit is basic like a
female version of what men were.

2987
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:59,510
When men are on television,

2988
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,040
they wear a suit jacket.

2989
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,570
They were and I shirt,

2990
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,920
they wear pants cause that isn't there
also a truth to how men naturally are

2991
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:08,810
drawn to women in certain outfits.

2992
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:13,811
I mean like men are more visual
[inaudible] talking about just how men,

2993
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:15,710
men,

2994
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:18,490
men get the fuck outta here.

2995
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:22,880
Oh is that the face of a woman who's
giving you these as a serious journalist?

2996
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:23,091
Yeah,

2997
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:23,721
she's so,

2998
01:19:23,721 --> 01:19:25,640
and that was back when
she was like way hotter.

2999
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:26,810
She have no problem with that.

3000
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:27,460
She's,

3001
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,390
she's probably either,

3002
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:29,630
what is that?

3003
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:30,710
Go in the upper right hand corner.

3004
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:31,420
Upper right hand corner.

3005
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:32,253
That series out there.

3006
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,540
[inaudible] her at all.

3007
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:35,720
She's stupid hot,

3008
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:36,080
right?

3009
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:36,913
Ridiculous.

3010
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,720
Short hair,

3011
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:42,720
which I imagine now imagine now disagree
with Don Lemon wearing that same

3012
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:43,400
outfit.

3013
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:43,820
Well,

3014
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,140
I wouldn't look in that actually.

3015
01:19:45,141 --> 01:19:46,310
I have good legs there.

3016
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:46,940
Okay.

3017
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:47,660
You don't know dude.

3018
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:48,680
You've seen me in high heels.

3019
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:50,080
Don Lemon's has been,

3020
01:19:50,081 --> 01:19:51,140
you don't have good legs.

3021
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:51,900
Ooh,

3022
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:52,580
yes I do.

3023
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,150
Okay,

3024
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:53,983
well you have shit.

3025
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:56,930
Yeah,

3026
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:58,730
I psoriasis flared up again.

3027
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:00,120
Fuck off.

3028
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:00,980
It flared up again.

3029
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,073
Short drive.

3030
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:03,930
I did.

3031
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:04,850
I know I,

3032
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:08,640
but I think my flu caused my psoriasis
from shore to have it all the time.

3033
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,030
I just got to the game.

3034
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,220
We have to,

3035
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,440
we have to make sure that we let
everybody know what we're saying here.

3036
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,240
I'm not saying that women should be
sexually harassed because they dress sec.

3037
01:20:16,241 --> 01:20:19,410
So now I'm saying if you wear something
that looks nice in the office,

3038
01:20:19,411 --> 01:20:20,310
I think guys should be like,

3039
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:20,791
damn,

3040
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:21,630
you look really good today.

3041
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:23,430
It's a problem because that was,

3042
01:20:23,431 --> 01:20:24,750
the girl responds to that.

3043
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:25,380
Then the guy's like,

3044
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:25,591
Ooh,

3045
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:26,550
she wants to Dick.

3046
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:30,900
I see she has to beat heads full about
how she walks to the water cooler by

3047
01:20:30,901 --> 01:20:33,660
herself and you've got to come up to
her and she's on her way to the bathroom

3048
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:34,950
and ask her weird questions.

3049
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:36,270
It's a Mama,

3050
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,400
but don't a lot of people
get married in the workplace?

3051
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:39,870
Don't they have romances in the workplace,

3052
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:40,201
don't they?

3053
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:41,034
Not Anymore.

3054
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,310
Or Eagle.

3055
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:43,711
Maybe it should be,

3056
01:20:43,711 --> 01:20:44,191
but I don't know.

3057
01:20:44,191 --> 01:20:46,100
That's where a lot of like
that's where you meet people.

3058
01:20:46,101 --> 01:20:48,690
I will have a bunch of people who are
really unhappy that's going to make men

3059
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:49,680
and women unhappy.

3060
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:51,540
Puritanical.

3061
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:52,940
I know a lot of people that,

3062
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:57,720
especially in like the TV business that
like the writer would like hook up with

3063
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:00,870
one of the girls who was in production
and then they want to be in married and

3064
01:21:00,871 --> 01:21:01,381
having kids.

3065
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:02,250
It's a great story.

3066
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:05,670
And I also know a lot where the writer
would hook up with one of the girls in

3067
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:09,140
production and then they would break up
and it would be a fucking disaster on

3068
01:21:09,141 --> 01:21:11,100
the sat and one of them
would wind up leaving.

3069
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:12,990
Angela's take that responsibility.

3070
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:13,291
Okay.

3071
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:14,580
You know what we're all asking for them.

3072
01:21:14,581 --> 01:21:15,600
Figuring on eight,

3073
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:18,000
we want to a higher authority,

3074
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:19,350
a corporate,

3075
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:20,400
nameless,

3076
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:25,460
faceless bureaucracy to to lay
down these laws on high in stone.

3077
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,340
And there are certain things you can't do.

3078
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,440
No relationships whatsoever.

3079
01:21:31,441 --> 01:21:32,910
I don't care if you're two human beings,

3080
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,050
awesome.

3081
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:36,600
The workplace is going to
be fucking great American.

3082
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:37,830
Let me throw a fucking happy,

3083
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,070
let me throw a scenario
at tasting to the band.

3084
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:42,960
Individuals responsibility
for managing their own,

3085
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,460
their own relationships,

3086
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:47,120
their own romance now and colleges.

3087
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,930
When fucking colleges,

3088
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:52,800
my nephews got to sit there and every
step of the way sexually he's got to go,

3089
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:53,634
is this okay?

3090
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:54,503
Is this okay?

3091
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:57,410
He's got to get consent
every time you gotta relax.

3092
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:58,263
Fuck that.

3093
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,850
Fuck that state.

3094
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,180
Everybody is big brother.

3095
01:22:03,181 --> 01:22:07,080
It's tyrannical and it's not
gonna make anybody happy or safer.

3096
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:08,670
It's all bullshit.

3097
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,520
You know what people that you know
why you walk a girl to a car at night?

3098
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:13,980
Not because men not cause a rape culture.

3099
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:17,460
Not because men are dangerous because
there are psychos out there cause there

3100
01:22:17,461 --> 01:22:20,770
are psychotics cause 1% both.

3101
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,653
I think both.

3102
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:22,321
What do you mean?

3103
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:25,320
There's a lot of guys
you got to watch out for.

3104
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:28,380
If you walk course there Auckland
it's going to buy or sell.

3105
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:29,790
It takes the one guy in a van.

3106
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:30,060
Right?

3107
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,190
But I'm saying psychos.

3108
01:22:31,191 --> 01:22:33,600
It's sometimes just a guy with a
couple of drinks in him as an asshole.

3109
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:35,250
Listen man,

3110
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,630
all my friends who are drunk,

3111
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,710
we've talked about this,

3112
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,810
you know rapists,

3113
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,220
rapists in jail,

3114
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:42,300
rape is in jail,

3115
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:43,860
have to be protected
from the other inmates.

3116
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,950
Men who are regular guys like I
was done like those long hold on.

3117
01:22:46,951 --> 01:22:48,180
No child rapists,

3118
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,110
I have to be protected.

3119
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:50,480
There's a lot of guys that are in jail.

3120
01:22:50,481 --> 01:22:50,820
He pretty,

3121
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,110
so Neil got arrested once,

3122
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,310
falsely accused of rape,

3123
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,920
and one of the things that he said
was that when he went to jail,

3124
01:22:55,921 --> 01:22:57,750
he was worried and guys would be like,

3125
01:22:57,751 --> 01:22:57,961
no,

3126
01:22:57,961 --> 01:22:58,070
no,

3127
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:58,200
no,

3128
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,190
that's a skin beef.

3129
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:00,570
They would call it a skin beef.

3130
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:01,081
I was like,

3131
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:03,180
that's not like no one thinks
you're a rapist is one thing.

3132
01:23:03,181 --> 01:23:05,780
If you get accused of being like
some serial rapist breaking a window,

3133
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,843
then you're fine.

3134
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:07,870
But a guy who will,

3135
01:23:07,871 --> 01:23:08,560
girl,

3136
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,030
they have a dispute in the girl,

3137
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,181
uh,

3138
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:11,200
claims the guy raped her,

3139
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:14,920
which no one wants to admit
happens and it happens way less.

3140
01:23:14,921 --> 01:23:19,921
I think way more women don't report rape
way more than women report false rape.

3141
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:26,790
I agree 100% way more women are in
Cabarrus disturbed sick and they feel

3142
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:29,201
dehumanized.

3143
01:23:29,201 --> 01:23:30,280
They don't even want to discuss it.

3144
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,750
They would rather not be outed as someone
who got raped and let this person get

3145
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:35,470
away with it.

3146
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,850
That's a common thing with women.

3147
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:37,050
That's,

3148
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:38,830
I think some of this
Hashtag [inaudible] is good,

3149
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,020
but also some women lie.

3150
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:42,340
That happens too.

3151
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,173
That's a bummer.

3152
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:43,900
But you can't.

3153
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:44,351
You can't.

3154
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:45,190
But they're humans.

3155
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,941
They're humans.

3156
01:23:45,941 --> 01:23:48,760
We can't tailor everything
towards those few negative apple.

3157
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:49,391
No you don't.

3158
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:53,660
But you don't tailor anything towards the
idea that those apples are nonexistent

3159
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,490
and impossible.

3160
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:55,090
Correct.

3161
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:56,830
But I'm going back to the office space.

3162
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,480
You're going to always deal
with false accusations.

3163
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:00,250
You're going to deal with
people that don't report things.

3164
01:24:00,251 --> 01:24:01,540
You're going to deal with
all these things in the,

3165
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:03,160
in the wide spectrum of humanity.

3166
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,910
I just don't think that
this zero tolerance,

3167
01:24:06,911 --> 01:24:08,680
nobody's allowed to date anybody
because we don't want to.

3168
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,820
And that's where we're at.

3169
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,220
That's what happens.

3170
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:12,440
I don't agree.

3171
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,110
We talked about it on our show and
I never even thought about too.

3172
01:24:15,111 --> 01:24:16,990
We were at the comedy store
and when I told that girl,

3173
01:24:16,991 --> 01:24:17,740
Nice Coda,

3174
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:19,460
Oh fuck did I see creek?

3175
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:19,810
Great.

3176
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:20,561
Cause he's young.

3177
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:22,780
You know she's 21 amazing comic.

3178
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:23,820
Pissed,

3179
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:24,180
pissed.

3180
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:25,360
Get the fuck Outta here.

3181
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:28,450
You guys are very wrestling
each other nephew.

3182
01:24:28,451 --> 01:24:29,450
One more fucking loose.

3183
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,293
His nephew,

3184
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:31,061
I don't know.

3185
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:32,800
He's going to some school
like is can't talk.

3186
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,170
You don't go pee.

3187
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,333
I'll be right back.

3188
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,960
Jesus Christ pan.

3189
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:40,420
He gets on you two are
like an old married couple.

3190
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:41,254
It's hilarious.

3191
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:41,860
Yeah,

3192
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:42,820
I want to kill him some days,

3193
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,630
but I think we're talking too
much about sexual harassment.

3194
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:48,370
I agree.

3195
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,330
And I think people,

3196
01:24:49,331 --> 01:24:50,200
people will shut it down.

3197
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:53,860
You know what the problem is with sexual
harassment too is it's everywhere.

3198
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,630
So shows like this,

3199
01:24:55,631 --> 01:24:57,330
they don't want to fucking
hit for it here either.

3200
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:59,290
We're trying to work it out.

3201
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:01,570
I think that's one of the important
things about talking about it,

3202
01:25:01,571 --> 01:25:02,201
but the problem has,

3203
01:25:02,201 --> 01:25:04,450
men are talking about it like we
don't know Jack Shit about it.

3204
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,171
Like I said,

3205
01:25:05,171 --> 01:25:07,480
I don't really deal with
deal with it and we don't,

3206
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:08,321
but here's the thing,

3207
01:25:08,321 --> 01:25:10,180
like no one's coming at us with it.

3208
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:13,630
Like I've only had gay guys hit on me
aggressively a couple of times ever in my

3209
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:15,280
life and it was day tried sucking my Dick.

3210
01:25:15,281 --> 01:25:16,150
I felt uncomfortable.

3211
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,020
Andy Dick,

3212
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:17,970
I'm just kidding by the way.

3213
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:18,701
I've tried,

3214
01:25:18,701 --> 01:25:19,534
but he's awesome.

3215
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,430
I had a comic once,

3216
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:25,330
the Montreal comedy festival like late
at night when we're all hanging around

3217
01:25:25,331 --> 01:25:25,840
the bar,

3218
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,610
get super aggressive with me.

3219
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:28,410
Yay.

3220
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:28,660
Yeah,

3221
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:29,980
super way back in the day.

3222
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:31,263
This is like,

3223
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:36,140
I want to say like late nineties real
uncomfortable moment where I'd tell him to

3224
01:25:36,141 --> 01:25:40,000
get the fuck away from me due to
it could have been some problems.

3225
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:40,690
No,

3226
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:43,000
it wasn't like a physically
threatening thing.

3227
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:46,180
I literally told them I would stomp a
fucking hole in his chest if he touched me

3228
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:46,340
again.

3229
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:46,871
Didn't work.

3230
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:47,704
It didn't turn on.

3231
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:48,190
No,

3232
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:48,900
it worked.

3233
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:49,480
Yeah.

3234
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:49,930
No,

3235
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:50,680
I was serious.

3236
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:50,981
I was like,

3237
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:53,980
you gotta stop punching blows up
when he was drunk and I wasn't.

3238
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:57,310
It was one of those weird moments
where someone is like being sexually

3239
01:25:57,311 --> 01:25:57,731
aggressive.

3240
01:25:57,731 --> 01:26:00,670
They think it's funny and then then
they tried to take it to the next level,

3241
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:02,050
show you how crazy they are.

3242
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:03,650
At some point that I was like,

3243
01:26:03,651 --> 01:26:04,910
did you not touch me like this?

3244
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:05,953
And then I realized like,

3245
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:06,261
Oh,

3246
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:10,070
this is what it's like when you're a
woman except the woman can't kill the guy.

3247
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:13,880
Now I'm dealing with a doughy
drunk comedian than I could kill.

3248
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:14,151
Yeah.

3249
01:26:14,151 --> 01:26:14,821
If he tried anything,

3250
01:26:14,821 --> 01:26:15,950
he just whoop his ass.

3251
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:16,990
Where women don't have worries,

3252
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,050
they don't have that option.

3253
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,870
At all and it's not funny.

3254
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:21,740
They weren't,

3255
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:22,220
you know,

3256
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:22,881
with a woman.

3257
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:24,290
It's not a funny situation with me.

3258
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:25,250
It's like it was funny.

3259
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,170
It was never like I was nervous,

3260
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,281
but it was like,

3261
01:26:28,281 --> 01:26:28,551
God,

3262
01:26:28,551 --> 01:26:29,420
this is gross.

3263
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:29,601
Well,

3264
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,820
I think you look at it a different
too because you have two daughters.

3265
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:35,270
I do now that I'm saying now it's like,

3266
01:26:35,271 --> 01:26:36,104
fuck man,

3267
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:38,000
you do that.

3268
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,380
He just having children,

3269
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:39,640
you,

3270
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:43,100
you look at people so differently because
children are so vulnerable and when

3271
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:45,620
you have a little kid and you see that
little kid trying to make your way

3272
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:46,191
through the world,

3273
01:26:46,191 --> 01:26:50,450
you think about them being victimized by
some sort of an evil Predator and it's

3274
01:26:50,451 --> 01:26:51,350
fucking awful.

3275
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:52,550
It's a terrible feeling.

3276
01:26:52,551 --> 01:26:52,821
It's a,

3277
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:53,450
it's a,

3278
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:57,290
it's a weird thing that we
have to reconcile the fact
that some people do prey

3279
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:58,124
on other peoples.

3280
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:00,920
What vulnerabilities
and weaknesses and do,

3281
01:27:00,921 --> 01:27:01,560
boy,

3282
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,170
yeah,

3283
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:02,880
boy,

3284
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,530
I'm looking for a new nanny and you
hear all these horrible stories about

3285
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,070
nannies and the molests kids,

3286
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:09,080
so it's the less kids being kids.

3287
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:13,450
There's some horrible videos of of nannies
like lifting kids up and throwing him

3288
01:27:13,451 --> 01:27:15,920
against their crib and
you can't watch them.

3289
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:18,780
They're so infuriating pieces.

3290
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,060
One kid,

3291
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,690
it was all fucked up and bruised and
the parents put this fucking camera and

3292
01:27:23,691 --> 01:27:27,200
they caught the lady picking the kid up
by his arms and literally throwing them

3293
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:28,640
across the room and you watch it.

3294
01:27:28,641 --> 01:27:29,150
You just like,

3295
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,350
oh my God,

3296
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:31,790
tough for me not to go to prison.

3297
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:33,890
If I came home and saw that
it would be really slow.

3298
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:36,320
So to have more self control,

3299
01:27:36,321 --> 01:27:37,630
a lot of people it'd be soap,

3300
01:27:37,631 --> 01:27:39,090
tough to choke.

3301
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:39,621
You know what they say?

3302
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:43,820
They gave the gave rise to the helicopter
parent phenomenon and one of the

3303
01:27:43,821 --> 01:27:47,600
things they talk about like how how
students are so entitled and they became

3304
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:50,510
sort of like this idea that they can
say anything they want and you know,

3305
01:27:50,511 --> 01:27:54,230
that's sort of the whole movement of
my personal serenity has everything.

3306
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:55,783
One of the,

3307
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,220
one of the theories
would be that in the 80s,

3308
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:01,420
when kids started disappearing
and you started reading about it,

3309
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:02,880
the end up on the back of my opponents,

3310
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:04,910
all of us as parents,

3311
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,140
as human beings,

3312
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:07,910
like there's nothing worse,

3313
01:28:07,911 --> 01:28:08,150
right?

3314
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:09,170
You can't think of anything worse.

3315
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:11,900
And that created this.

3316
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,630
Every parent your biggest
fear right now you go,

3317
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:19,790
I'm not letting my kid take his bike
down to the neighbors cause it might only

3318
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,020
be 600 yards,

3319
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:21,800
but,

3320
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,310
uh,

3321
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:25,290
John Wayne Gacy might be waiting
till my dad didn't let me know.

3322
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:27,200
I'll come to always happened actually.

3323
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:28,213
But it was,

3324
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:28,491
you know,

3325
01:28:28,491 --> 01:28:29,100
now people say,

3326
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,100
remember when we used to
be able to play out there?

3327
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:31,941
It's always happened,

3328
01:28:31,941 --> 01:28:32,510
but we,

3329
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:33,680
we started learning about it.

3330
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:35,300
People started establishing
patterns about it.

3331
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,570
Then we hadn't like certain serial
killers like John Wayne Gacy and,

3332
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:39,643
and uh,

3333
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:39,920
uh,

3334
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,330
ted Bundy and stuff like that.

3335
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:43,590
And we do.dodge bullets
twice in my own life.

3336
01:28:43,591 --> 01:28:45,830
So dodged a bullet once when
I was about eight years old.

3337
01:28:45,831 --> 01:28:46,221
And again,

3338
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:47,960
when I was about 13 dodge a bullet.

3339
01:28:47,961 --> 01:28:49,310
You mean for guys who
are trying to fuck me?

3340
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:49,840
What?

3341
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:50,260
Yeah,

3342
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:50,601
yeah.

3343
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:53,620
A guy tried to take me out of a
library when I was a little kid,

3344
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:55,490
that library and starts yelling out.

3345
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:59,330
He was gonna show me these books in his
car and the library and started yelling

3346
01:28:59,331 --> 01:28:59,541
out,

3347
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:00,051
Joseph,

3348
01:29:00,051 --> 01:29:01,170
you get away from him.

3349
01:29:01,171 --> 01:29:03,510
That guy just got out of
jail and I'm fucking crying.

3350
01:29:03,511 --> 01:29:05,340
And I run to her and the
guy runs out of there.

3351
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:10,410
And then another time when I was 13 some
guy like literally tried to get closer

3352
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:11,850
and closer to me and my friends.

3353
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:13,890
He would jog around this
lake that we would fish at,

3354
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:15,120
sit down and talk to us,

3355
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:16,350
seem like a super nice guy.

3356
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:20,610
And then it got creepier and weirder
until one day he showed up drunk.

3357
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,760
He told me he loved me and
that know love could be a,

3358
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:25,230
you can't have love without sex.

3359
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:25,770
And I was like,

3360
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:26,560
why?

3361
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,560
And I was 13 and I was,

3362
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:31,200
I was skinny kid and I was hiding,

3363
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:31,561
you know,

3364
01:29:31,561 --> 01:29:35,220
we were in this area of
this pond where it's like,

3365
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:36,540
yeah,

3366
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:37,111
he's a man,

3367
01:29:37,111 --> 01:29:37,531
a grow man,

3368
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:38,331
a big man too.

3369
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:38,880
And he wants,

3370
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:39,750
and there's,

3371
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:40,171
you know,

3372
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:43,650
I'm waiting for a jogger to combine and
catch this guy fucking me in the ass and

3373
01:29:43,651 --> 01:29:44,161
the bushes.

3374
01:29:44,161 --> 01:29:45,870
Like what do I do so not to do.

3375
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,820
I told him get the fuck away from me.

3376
01:29:47,821 --> 01:29:49,620
I put my hand in my
pocket where had a knife.

3377
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:51,070
I held onto the network as if I could do,

3378
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,710
I never 13 year old tries to cut.

3379
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:53,910
You cut that Dick though.

3380
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:57,020
Maybe he didn't grab your arms first.

3381
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:57,960
I wasn't strong.

3382
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,840
I was super volt.

3383
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:04,850
But my point is I got lucky and dodge
two bullets in my life and they weren't

3384
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:05,581
bad bullets.

3385
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:09,150
It wasn't like some Guy Corps formed me
and threw me in a van fuck and he asked

3386
01:30:09,151 --> 01:30:09,720
for a month.

3387
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,350
That's scary.

3388
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:11,020
But it's,

3389
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:12,840
it's not worst case scenario,

3390
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:16,380
but it was enough to know what those
things are real and they're out there.

3391
01:30:16,381 --> 01:30:17,400
There's a lot of my buddy,

3392
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:18,600
my buddy got a,

3393
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,910
from the age of nine to 12,

3394
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:26,160
this guy was just this master
manipulator and he ended up like getting

3395
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:29,760
essentially rate from nine to
12 and he was their neighbor.

3396
01:30:29,761 --> 01:30:30,241
He was like,

3397
01:30:30,241 --> 01:30:30,960
he lived,

3398
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:31,501
he was like,

3399
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:32,190
uh,

3400
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:33,420
probably 25,

3401
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:33,721
whatever.

3402
01:30:33,721 --> 01:30:37,410
And he lived and he did work
around the place and he would,

3403
01:30:37,411 --> 01:30:41,340
he was really good at
was he got my friend to,

3404
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:42,673
uh,

3405
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:45,600
like he created a sympathetic character.

3406
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,490
So my friend felt like he was like,

3407
01:30:47,491 --> 01:30:47,851
I had to,

3408
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:50,700
I was having sex with them cause I felt
like I was taking care of him otherwise

3409
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:52,770
he would die if I didn't like he was.

3410
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:53,930
And so yes,

3411
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:54,771
we put all the stuff on him.

3412
01:30:54,771 --> 01:30:57,480
And then what happened was he
went through all that as mother.

3413
01:30:57,481 --> 01:30:58,470
Like they found out,

3414
01:30:58,471 --> 01:30:58,921
his mother said,

3415
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:00,000
you did nothing wrong,

3416
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,440
but they didn't know they fucking,

3417
01:31:01,441 --> 01:31:02,274
this is the 70s,

3418
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:03,623
early eighties.

3419
01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:05,130
They go through the whole thing.

3420
01:31:05,190 --> 01:31:06,720
The Guy I think went to jail,

3421
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:09,000
but it was later,

3422
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:13,020
it was later that that trauma began
to manifest itself like later on.

3423
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,730
And he was never really,

3424
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,540
he's never,

3425
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,373
he's never,

3426
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:16,710
oh,

3427
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:18,420
he's gotta be feeling gross,

3428
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,610
dirty and you hate yourself.

3429
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:21,470
Like he,

3430
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:23,250
when he is he gay now,

3431
01:31:23,251 --> 01:31:24,810
but he's not gay.

3432
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:27,330
But he was never able to,

3433
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:29,250
I don't want to say too
much cause you know,

3434
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:29,610
he's,

3435
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:30,070
he's,

3436
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:31,170
I haven't talked to him all the time,

3437
01:31:31,171 --> 01:31:31,740
but he was,

3438
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,431
I was close to him.

3439
01:31:32,431 --> 01:31:33,180
You might've,

3440
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:33,990
no,

3441
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:35,400
I think I've told you a little bit about,

3442
01:31:35,401 --> 01:31:35,580
um,

3443
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:35,761
uh,

3444
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:36,021
he,

3445
01:31:36,021 --> 01:31:38,730
he would paint was a great painter.

3446
01:31:38,731 --> 01:31:42,900
I have some of his paintings in my home
and he was such a great special guy,

3447
01:31:42,901 --> 01:31:43,860
but he would know,

3448
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:45,750
but he would paint the same
thing over and over again.

3449
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:48,270
And he never ever painted
anything different.

3450
01:31:48,271 --> 01:31:49,560
Variation plus cause gut.

3451
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:52,240
But you know what?

3452
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:57,060
I think humans need to pay attention
to the worst aspects of our behavior.

3453
01:31:57,061 --> 01:31:59,830
And one of the things that Jordan Peterson
has said that I think is incredibly

3454
01:31:59,831 --> 01:32:00,450
important

3455
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:03,370
is what scares us the most
about Nazis and murderers,

3456
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:05,390
psychopaths and rapists,

3457
01:32:05,391 --> 01:32:10,391
is we are all human and giving the right
set of circumstances with the right set

3458
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:13,570
of input and the right set of genetics
and the right set of environments and the

3459
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:16,600
right set of life experiences and the
right set of abuse in the household

3460
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:17,434
growing up.

3461
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:20,020
You could be that person too and enjoy it.

3462
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:20,380
Yeah,

3463
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:23,070
and when you talk to neuroscientists and,

3464
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:23,440
and,

3465
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,950
and people that are actually studying
how the human brain develops.

3466
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:30,670
And one of the things that Robert Sapolsky
said when I had him on the podcast is

3467
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:31,960
a really fascinating thing.

3468
01:32:31,961 --> 01:32:36,520
He said that I think in the future we
are going to look back at the idea of

3469
01:32:36,521 --> 01:32:41,190
punishing someone for their actions as
being so incredibly shortsighted and

3470
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,970
foolhardy because what this person is,

3471
01:32:42,971 --> 01:32:44,920
when you think about the
concept of determinism,

3472
01:32:44,921 --> 01:32:45,390
right,

3473
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:45,580
the,

3474
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:49,030
the concept of everything in your life
has led you to be who you are right now.

3475
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,570
And your,

3476
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:52,270
your idea of free will is
essentially an illusion.

3477
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:56,200
Your freewill is based on so many
different factors that you have no control

3478
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:58,240
over and they influence
you to such a great,

3479
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,890
such a great deal.

3480
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:03,460
The idea that this person is in this
terrible situation that does this terrible

3481
01:33:03,461 --> 01:33:06,810
crime is just acting out
of evil intentions is,

3482
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:10,390
is it's a foolish way of understanding
how the human brain develops.

3483
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:10,890
Yeah.

3484
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:11,651
What's he say that,

3485
01:33:11,651 --> 01:33:13,150
how would you treat those people?

3486
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,380
It's a very good question and no one's,

3487
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:15,820
no one's answered that.

3488
01:33:15,821 --> 01:33:17,480
Back in the day when somebody
had an epileptic seizure,

3489
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,700
epileptic seizure,

3490
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:19,571
uh,

3491
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:20,140
you were,

3492
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,630
you are thought to have
been possessed by a demon.

3493
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,130
If you hit somebody,

3494
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:24,550
they would,

3495
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,880
they would,

3496
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:25,270
they would,

3497
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:26,530
you would be held accountable to that.

3498
01:33:26,531 --> 01:33:28,690
But what I thought was
fascinating was a world war one.

3499
01:33:28,691 --> 01:33:33,691
Dan Carlin talks about this as well in
world war one when they didn't know what

3500
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:38,770
kind of concussion the bombs and their
concussion would do to a soldier over and

3501
01:33:38,771 --> 01:33:40,990
over and sleep deprivation
living in those trenches.

3502
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:45,070
And what happened was some people
would just begin to go into shock.

3503
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:49,150
They would get shell shocked
and so you could see them,

3504
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:52,630
their bodies would start to constrict
and they couldn't really move.

3505
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,490
But back in the day,

3506
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:59,500
those guys would be brought out and shot
for cowardice because they were being

3507
01:33:59,501 --> 01:34:00,430
cowards.

3508
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:01,270
They weren't,

3509
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:02,680
and you could see their bodies.

3510
01:34:02,681 --> 01:34:05,630
We're actually manifesting right to,

3511
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:09,640
of like the problem with drafting and
army are requiring people to sign up,

3512
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:10,141
you know,

3513
01:34:10,141 --> 01:34:13,180
or making it some sort of a cultural
mandate is there's some people that are

3514
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:14,450
just not designed for,

3515
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:16,060
they can't handle pressure.

3516
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:16,923
No.

3517
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,810
There's a lot of people that just
can't handle fucking pressure period.

3518
01:34:19,811 --> 01:34:20,860
And for whatever reason,

3519
01:34:20,861 --> 01:34:22,210
whether it's biological,

3520
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,650
whether it's environmental,

3521
01:34:23,651 --> 01:34:25,870
whether it's a combination
of nature and nurture,

3522
01:34:25,871 --> 01:34:26,441
who knows?

3523
01:34:26,441 --> 01:34:30,280
But there's some people that
just as of right now there,

3524
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,133
they just can't do it.

3525
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:31,931
They just cannot.

3526
01:34:31,931 --> 01:34:32,770
They can't handle pressure.

3527
01:34:32,771 --> 01:34:33,341
Also also,

3528
01:34:33,341 --> 01:34:34,174
there's also this,

3529
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:35,050
there's injury.

3530
01:34:35,051 --> 01:34:39,030
There's also a more constant sleep
deprivation injury that nobody can handle.

3531
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:41,730
And the shock of impacts near you.

3532
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:42,400
You know,

3533
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:42,701
there's,

3534
01:34:42,701 --> 01:34:44,680
there's a lot that
happens to people and the,

3535
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:45,311
you know,

3536
01:34:45,311 --> 01:34:48,550
obviously the psychological trauma
of it all and knowing that at any,

3537
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,320
any step you could step on a landmine.

3538
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:50,740
Any step,

3539
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,330
you catch a bullet in
the head and he's tab.

3540
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:53,030
Yeah,

3541
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:55,220
the Jordan said something
else that was interesting.

3542
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,830
He's helped people with PTSD when

3543
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,190
they come back from a war and they were
from Iowa and they had a very sort of

3544
01:35:01,191 --> 01:35:03,290
linear notion of was first
of all of the military.

3545
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:03,980
I want to be,

3546
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:04,940
I want to be a man.

3547
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:05,630
I wanna,

3548
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:07,310
I wanna I want to do the right thing.

3549
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:08,323
Duty,

3550
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:08,900
honor,

3551
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,441
loyalty,

3552
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:10,850
these linear concepts,

3553
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:13,550
of course you get into war and
all of that gets shattered.

3554
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:16,940
Sometimes it might even get mocked
just because there's the fog of war.

3555
01:35:16,941 --> 01:35:20,510
There's so many things you do and some
of these guys end up doing things that

3556
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:25,810
are to them or because of
the circumstances may be
inexplicably cruel or just

3557
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:30,851
they did something that they can't live
down and he would always kind of help

3558
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:36,071
them see that human beings being the
bipolar ape that we are are capable of

3559
01:35:37,761 --> 01:35:42,380
incredible kindness and and beautiful
construction and of course on the other

3560
01:35:42,381 --> 01:35:43,730
side of that,

3561
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:48,820
you have in you the ability
to do unspeakable violence
and terrible destruction

3562
01:35:49,461 --> 01:35:51,110
for its own sake and oh,

3563
01:35:51,111 --> 01:35:51,681
by the way,

3564
01:35:51,681 --> 01:35:53,390
in the moment to enjoy it.

3565
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:55,040
That's being a human being.

3566
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:56,780
We're fucking complicated men,

3567
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:57,753
et cetera.

3568
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,270
That's also how we got here.

3569
01:35:59,290 --> 01:35:59,530
Yes.

3570
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:02,570
The only way you get from the wild Ayp
swinging for the fuck threw the fucking

3571
01:36:02,571 --> 01:36:07,430
trees in the jungle to 2017 with your
Tesla driving you down the street without

3572
01:36:07,431 --> 01:36:08,750
you even touching the steering wheel.

3573
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:10,790
The only way you get to
that is through aggression.

3574
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:11,300
Yeah,

3575
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,290
I mean it sounds crazy,

3576
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:15,950
but you get to that through aggression
and competition because if you don't have

3577
01:36:15,951 --> 01:36:16,400
those,

3578
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,050
that ability to survive,

3579
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:19,760
you're not going to get past the Jaguars.

3580
01:36:19,761 --> 01:36:20,760
You're not going to get past the,

3581
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,370
the invading tribes,

3582
01:36:22,371 --> 01:36:22,851
you're not going to get.

3583
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:24,950
So you don't need that today.

3584
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,390
I'm not saying you need it today,

3585
01:36:26,391 --> 01:36:31,340
but the only reason why we got out of
those terrible situations is because we

3586
01:36:31,341 --> 01:36:36,230
have the ability to become that monster
that defends itself or that monster that

3587
01:36:36,231 --> 01:36:37,670
attacks for its own interests.

3588
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,040
That's literally what
facilitated us developing.

3589
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:40,281
Yeah.

3590
01:36:40,281 --> 01:36:43,700
And also the fact that
development requires a certain
amount of destruction in,

3591
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:46,130
in terms of like I did
this podcast with him,

3592
01:36:46,131 --> 01:36:47,990
I'm going to drop soon
on mixed marital arts.

3593
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:49,700
And W he,

3594
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:51,410
he said something cause
somebody who wrote this article,

3595
01:36:51,411 --> 01:36:54,860
this woman and professor
wrote this article about how
certain speeches violent.

3596
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:59,300
Because when you say something that
I disagree with or that hurts my

3597
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:00,134
sensibilities,

3598
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:03,950
it puts me in a state of stress
and that would be violence cause I,

3599
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:05,330
and so Jordan said,

3600
01:37:05,331 --> 01:37:05,631
fine,

3601
01:37:05,631 --> 01:37:07,070
let's extrapolate for a second.

3602
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:08,210
Yes,

3603
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:08,751
it's true.

3604
01:37:08,751 --> 01:37:10,190
That words can pierce your heart.

3605
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:10,491
I mean,

3606
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:10,791
he said,

3607
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:12,170
I'd rather get punched in the face.

3608
01:37:12,171 --> 01:37:12,941
You got to hear him say it,

3609
01:37:12,941 --> 01:37:13,430
but,

3610
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:17,650
but he said essentially
the problem is it it what,

3611
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:19,370
what about six months down the line,

3612
01:37:19,371 --> 01:37:20,630
if I am trying to get help,

3613
01:37:20,631 --> 01:37:24,320
you grow and become a better person
and I see a fundamental flaw in your

3614
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:25,430
behavior,

3615
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,930
in your character,

3616
01:37:27,170 --> 01:37:30,110
and I tell you if you have bad
breath and you can't get a date,

3617
01:37:30,111 --> 01:37:30,351
and I go,

3618
01:37:30,351 --> 01:37:30,561
dude,

3619
01:37:30,561 --> 01:37:32,540
your breath could melt paint at first.

3620
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:34,670
It's going to be fucking
embarrassing to you,

3621
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,240
but you're gonna thank me six months down
the line when you did something about

3622
01:37:38,241 --> 01:37:38,600
it.

3623
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,500
More importantly,

3624
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:40,370
if you say to somebody,

3625
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:41,540
do you want to be,

3626
01:37:41,541 --> 01:37:43,460
I hope I see you trying to be this,

3627
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:43,871
whether it,

3628
01:37:43,871 --> 01:37:44,930
it might a great comic,

3629
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,161
you don't,

3630
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:46,610
right?

3631
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,810
You're not disciplined,

3632
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,740
whatever it might be,

3633
01:37:48,741 --> 01:37:50,290
you don't want to hear
them about an issue,

3634
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:51,463
the truth,

3635
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:54,140
and sometimes you have a set of beliefs,

3636
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:56,160
a sort of built your house around

3637
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,050
this set of like sort of an ideology.

3638
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:01,230
You think you have the truth as somebody
comes along with a different idea,

3639
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:05,340
a different point of view that
shatters those walls and man,

3640
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:06,300
you don't like it.

3641
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:08,370
You want to go back to your safe space,

3642
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,870
but good luck growing.

3643
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:13,500
You don't get closer to the
truth by fucking saying you're,

3644
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:14,660
you're causing violence.

3645
01:38:14,661 --> 01:38:17,640
I think the real problem with this is
that these people are not trying to grow.

3646
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:21,540
The people that are trying to change the
definitions of words to suit their own

3647
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:22,141
intentions.

3648
01:38:22,141 --> 01:38:25,410
They don't want to have the
option and it's not by chance.

3649
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:27,840
The the same people that
support Marxists ideologies,

3650
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,370
they don't want competition.

3651
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,170
They want a lack of competition.

3652
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:32,610
I think competition is bad.

3653
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:36,300
There's a lot of that out there because
they're not good at it because they

3654
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:40,740
don't want to face that ultimate objective
view of who they really are and the

3655
01:38:40,741 --> 01:38:41,760
actual capabilities.

3656
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:45,870
They'd rather get a bunch of fucking
weird social justice Brownie points for a

3657
01:38:45,871 --> 01:38:47,360
bunch of weird things and you know,

3658
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:48,990
there's a lot of that.

3659
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:52,080
There's a lot of that you're going to
and you could see those patterns and the

3660
01:38:52,081 --> 01:38:52,891
way those people talk.

3661
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:54,630
They have very specific ways of talking.

3662
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,480
You can point out very
specific things that they say,

3663
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:59,170
things that they talk about their,

3664
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:01,470
they're going to be the first
to talk about white privilege.

3665
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:04,260
They're going to be the first to
talk about trans rights and all these

3666
01:39:04,261 --> 01:39:04,740
different,

3667
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:07,050
there's a wet and
there's a way of talking,

3668
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:11,130
an actual pattern that the way they
communicate your words are violence.

3669
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:11,520
There's,

3670
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,190
there's literally a pattern
that they've adopted,

3671
01:39:14,191 --> 01:39:19,191
a predetermined pattern or behavior of
thinking the ideology and in the way they

3672
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:19,921
communicate.

3673
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:21,570
So they all know that
they're on the same team.

3674
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:23,160
It's called owning your impact,

3675
01:39:23,161 --> 01:39:24,090
your verbal impact,

3676
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:25,800
and there's,

3677
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,190
there's a,

3678
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:29,400
there's a pattern to the way the
noises come out of their mouth.

3679
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,470
It's fascinating because there's so,

3680
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:33,330
there's so uniform,

3681
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:36,090
it's so common to hear these
people talk the same way.

3682
01:39:36,091 --> 01:39:39,930
When Jordan Peterson got in this
debate on television with this,

3683
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:45,180
it looks like a man and I say it in the
same way that they in them or pronouns.

3684
01:39:45,181 --> 01:39:46,740
I don't mean to be negative.

3685
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:49,710
I don't know if this is a man or
a woman because she's clearly,

3686
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:51,480
he's clearly Uber feminine,

3687
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:55,500
but has a beard and says there is
no biological difference in gender.

3688
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:58,900
He sort of Medicine University of Toronto.

3689
01:39:58,930 --> 01:39:59,401
I saw that.

3690
01:39:59,401 --> 01:39:59,551
He goes,

3691
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:00,810
I'd be happy to unpack that for you.

3692
01:40:00,811 --> 01:40:01,644
And it's like,

3693
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:02,190
oh,

3694
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:02,401
x,

3695
01:40:02,401 --> 01:40:03,360
y chromosomes.

3696
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:04,380
If you could find that,

3697
01:40:04,381 --> 01:40:07,530
see if you could just find that
guy saying to Jordan Peterson,

3698
01:40:07,531 --> 01:40:10,710
he was no biological basis for gender.

3699
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:14,490
They were trying to force some under
penalty of law and fine or whatever,

3700
01:40:14,491 --> 01:40:15,324
and jail,

3701
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:15,990
uh,

3702
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:17,010
to use,

3703
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,590
to not use someone's preferred Pronoun,

3704
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:22,110
which I would do just because I don't
want to hurt somebody's feelings,

3705
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:24,060
but they're trying to pass and it's law.

3706
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:27,180
So if you didn't use Xer or whatever,

3707
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:31,340
you would be a gender
Pronoun tries in Toronto.

3708
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:31,870
Yes.

3709
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:33,240
It'd be tried for,

3710
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:33,870
um,

3711
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:35,340
you'd be tried for hate speech.

3712
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,070
And that's where we had,

3713
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:38,491
you know,

3714
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:39,690
with that Communists,

3715
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:40,400
they always,

3716
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:44,460
comics was of true religion in the
Soviet Union and they had essentially

3717
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:47,010
clergymen people who were sort of,

3718
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:47,970
uh,

3719
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:48,730
you know,

3720
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:50,610
at the purest form of a priest.

3721
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:53,530
The idea that somebody would go around
and check with the soldiers to make sure

3722
01:40:53,531 --> 01:40:54,550
that their piety,

3723
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,940
that their allegiance to the
communist cause was intact.

3724
01:40:57,941 --> 01:41:01,680
And they'd ask you questions or other
cultures having these problems where these

3725
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:04,000
[inaudible] coming up and all that stuff.

3726
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:04,451
I mean,

3727
01:41:04,451 --> 01:41:07,060
it's happening pro down at
us happening in America.

3728
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:09,170
I'm sure it's probably
happening in different ways.

3729
01:41:09,171 --> 01:41:13,030
It happened in like Europe and Brazil
and in the 20th century it was called

3730
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:13,721
Fascism.

3731
01:41:13,721 --> 01:41:14,890
It was called communism.

3732
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:17,560
Human beings love religion.

3733
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:19,540
We're all religious.

3734
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:21,010
And if you,

3735
01:41:21,011 --> 01:41:21,770
and there's,

3736
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:24,580
there are manmade religion
and other religions that are,

3737
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:25,420
you know,

3738
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:28,750
at least purported to be from on high,

3739
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:30,310
at least with on high religions,

3740
01:41:30,311 --> 01:41:31,450
they're rather fixed.

3741
01:41:31,451 --> 01:41:35,010
It seems that manmade religions
tend to be more ideologies.

3742
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:36,010
Um,

3743
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:37,330
and the difference between those,

3744
01:41:37,331 --> 01:41:37,691
by the way,

3745
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:38,510
his philosophy,

3746
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:41,830
something that's trying to get to the
truth with logic and reason and debate

3747
01:41:42,350 --> 01:41:43,060
etiologies.

3748
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:44,200
There's no room for debate.

3749
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:45,130
It goes back to what you were saying.

3750
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:46,240
There's no room for debate.

3751
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:47,650
We have the answers,

3752
01:41:47,651 --> 01:41:48,484
ladies and gentlemen,

3753
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:50,350
that is equality in all costs.

3754
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:50,651
Yeah.

3755
01:41:50,651 --> 01:41:52,300
I'd be happy to impact that for you.

3756
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:53,020
Yes,

3757
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:53,411
yes.

3758
01:41:53,411 --> 01:41:54,210
To have that video.

3759
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:56,080
Now we'll see if we could find that.

3760
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:57,143
Jimmy will find it.

3761
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:59,050
I can't stand the guy but,

3762
01:41:59,051 --> 01:42:01,450
but it was a bizarre
conversation because it's like,

3763
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:01,871
okay,

3764
01:42:01,871 --> 01:42:02,650
I see what you're doing.

3765
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:06,220
You're trying to reinvent reality and
there's a bunch of people that support

3766
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:06,600
you.

3767
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,130
There's a bunch of other people that are
delusional and there also right there

3768
01:42:09,131 --> 01:42:11,050
with you trying to reinvent reality.

3769
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:11,510
Is there a,

3770
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:12,940
is there a huge movement?

3771
01:42:12,941 --> 01:42:14,320
Like is this a big thing?

3772
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:16,180
There's enough that people
were talking about it.

3773
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:17,830
The thing about losing morale too though.

3774
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:18,131
Yeah,

3775
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:18,950
of course they are.

3776
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:20,440
Course there's not enough people.

3777
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:22,640
There's not enough people
are going to support it.

3778
01:42:22,641 --> 01:42:24,200
There's so many real Morgan to reject it.

3779
01:42:24,201 --> 01:42:24,521
It'd be like,

3780
01:42:24,521 --> 01:42:25,001
get the fuck out.

3781
01:42:25,001 --> 01:42:25,601
And not only that,

3782
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:27,190
this is not like a behavior thing.

3783
01:42:27,191 --> 01:42:28,090
This is science.

3784
01:42:28,091 --> 01:42:29,450
You're talking about chromosomes.

3785
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:31,510
You talking about gender dysphoria,

3786
01:42:31,511 --> 01:42:33,700
you're talking about all sorts of
different issues that are like,

3787
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,840
these are recognized actual
issues that human beings have.

3788
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:39,300
Well,

3789
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,840
what are these issues though?

3790
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:42,520
Are you saying there's no,

3791
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,560
there's no scientific basis.

3792
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,110
You're saying you can't differentiate
between a male and a woman,

3793
01:42:47,111 --> 01:42:47,980
a man and a female.

3794
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:49,720
That is bizarre nonsense.

3795
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,750
Of course you can make
a distinction between,

3796
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:57,790
you could make the distinction
between male and female and then um,

3797
01:42:58,150 --> 01:42:59,500
he and her in a way.

3798
01:42:59,501 --> 01:43:00,050
Here we go.

3799
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:00,171
Yeah.

3800
01:43:00,171 --> 01:43:02,250
This is the bald one is the
one who said that it okay.

3801
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:02,800
Yeah.

3802
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,450
Yeah.

3803
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:05,440
Well woman's in a women's
studies department.

3804
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:06,303
Yeah.

3805
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,393
Hold on a second.

3806
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,760
Cause he's not transgender.

3807
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:10,990
The something going on.

3808
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,130
Really

3809
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:15,550
it's not correct that there is
such a thing as biological sex.

3810
01:43:15,551 --> 01:43:17,020
And I'm a historian of medicine.

3811
01:43:17,021 --> 01:43:20,050
I can unpack that for you
at grandma's fucking crazy.

3812
01:43:20,051 --> 01:43:22,080
In the interest of time I won't.

3813
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:24,430
So that's a very popular misconception.

3814
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:25,264
So I essentially,

3815
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:27,040
in my transgender studies classes,

3816
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:32,020
what we're doing is looking at actual
research and identify ways that current

3817
01:43:32,021 --> 01:43:36,120
social issues related to trans people or
things that are associated with trans,

3818
01:43:36,121 --> 01:43:38,110
such as free speech arguments and claims.

3819
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:39,130
Uh,

3820
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:39,780
hard times,

3821
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,640
nice to speech arguments in a way that
people are thinking in the way that

3822
01:43:42,641 --> 01:43:43,630
research has been framed,

3823
01:43:43,631 --> 01:43:46,100
the history there was some
of the other prisoners area.

3824
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:50,480
Typically I don't focus on
pronouns because pronouns
are actually part of a CIS

3825
01:43:50,481 --> 01:43:51,380
normative culture.

3826
01:43:51,381 --> 01:43:52,100
So what we do

3827
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:52,761
is learn about it.

3828
01:43:52,761 --> 01:43:55,110
I'm going to stop you
right there to explain it,

3829
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:56,810
but we don't start from the forearm

3830
01:43:58,450 --> 01:44:02,770
to this guy's a good guy or
girl that used to be a girl.

3831
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:03,740
That's a man.

3832
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:05,660
Did it used to be a woman
has a better beard than me?

3833
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:05,811
No,

3834
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:06,644
that's a man.

3835
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:08,210
That's a man on hormones.

3836
01:44:08,211 --> 01:44:11,750
I think that's a man on a
female that's on male hormone.

3837
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:11,861
No,

3838
01:44:11,861 --> 01:44:12,680
I disagree.

3839
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:13,160
I think it's,

3840
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:13,480
you know,

3841
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:14,313
good to hear.

3842
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:16,010
Do you know Buck Angeles?

3843
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:16,900
No.

3844
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:17,691
Buck angels,

3845
01:44:17,691 --> 01:44:22,070
a porn star that was born a woman that
became a man through hormones and she was

3846
01:44:22,071 --> 01:44:22,791
on the podcast.

3847
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:23,630
He was on the podcast.

3848
01:44:23,631 --> 01:44:23,781
He's a,

3849
01:44:23,781 --> 01:44:26,090
he now talks exactly like that guy.

3850
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:27,240
Sounds just like him.

3851
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,290
That guy right there that's
born a woman born a woman.

3852
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:32,040
Yup.

3853
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:32,310
Yeah,

3854
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:34,430
but just play a clip
of him on the podcast.

3855
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,170
This is what I want you to hear.

3856
01:44:36,171 --> 01:44:41,171
I want you to hear the way he sounds
because he sounds literally exactly like

3857
01:44:41,181 --> 01:44:41,691
that guy.

3858
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:43,730
Like he could be doing an
impression of that guy.

3859
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:46,910
Look at it is all jacked and yoke to shit.

3860
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:47,570
Get along.

3861
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:49,370
Goes is a couple of years ago,

3862
01:44:49,371 --> 01:44:51,170
I want to say a hundred
thousand years ago,

3863
01:44:51,171 --> 01:44:55,030
200,000 years ago when
we were women and a run,

3864
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,240
two women had a fight.

3865
01:44:56,241 --> 01:44:57,770
Two women had to stay alive.

3866
01:44:57,771 --> 01:45:01,850
Women had to protect their babies and
they didn't have to do it as much or often

3867
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,170
get to him and get to him.

3868
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:05,083
Exactly.

3869
01:45:05,350 --> 01:45:09,080
And they'll be less likely to stick
around and raise their children cannot

3870
01:45:09,081 --> 01:45:09,914
exist,

3871
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:10,880
but don't they?

3872
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:12,410
Like it doesn't make sense to me.

3873
01:45:12,411 --> 01:45:13,150
The whole,

3874
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:14,510
the whole building.

3875
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:16,820
I used to be a female taking,

3876
01:45:16,821 --> 01:45:17,150
yeah,

3877
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:17,940
let me see it before Friday.

3878
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:18,740
But here's the thing.

3879
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:19,030
Let me see.

3880
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:19,863
Same order,

3881
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:20,773
same voice.

3882
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:25,250
I think that that guy
is a guy who was born,

3883
01:45:25,251 --> 01:45:27,980
a woman who took me on
hormones just like buck angel.

3884
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:30,200
Maybe you might be fucking on it,

3885
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:33,050
but the idea that there's
no biological difference,

3886
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,340
but I don't see a naked picture.

3887
01:45:34,341 --> 01:45:35,090
So that's the above.

3888
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:36,800
Let me see the the girl version.

3889
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:38,060
It doesn't have his license.

3890
01:45:38,350 --> 01:45:38,750
That's,

3891
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:39,870
that's not what act.

3892
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:40,731
No,

3893
01:45:40,731 --> 01:45:40,911
no,

3894
01:45:40,911 --> 01:45:41,121
no,

3895
01:45:41,121 --> 01:45:41,301
no,

3896
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:41,840
no.

3897
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,790
That's not what you would see.

3898
01:45:43,791 --> 01:45:46,220
See what is the word
I'm trying to look for?

3899
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:47,960
I that him right there.

3900
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:49,370
That was before and after it said,

3901
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:50,180
come on,

3902
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:52,140
really this,

3903
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:52,680
this,

3904
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:53,241
this makes sense.

3905
01:45:53,241 --> 01:45:54,074
Like I feel like if the,

3906
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,340
if the world had my,

3907
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:59,000
my attitude full me wait,

3908
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,730
but the world at your absolute perfect.

3909
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:02,100
No,

3910
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:02,281
no,

3911
01:46:02,281 --> 01:46:02,420
no,

3912
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:02,961
definitely not.

3913
01:46:02,961 --> 01:46:04,640
But I think the world that
my attitude about this,

3914
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:05,840
like even as a kid,

3915
01:46:05,841 --> 01:46:10,100
if I saw that somebody was
very feminine or I saw that,

3916
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,690
like say somebody was like,

3917
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:12,201
I feel like,

3918
01:46:12,201 --> 01:46:12,570
uh,

3919
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:13,190
uh,

3920
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:13,761
I'm a woman,

3921
01:46:13,761 --> 01:46:18,260
but I want to be a man or a man with a
protected that person and more important

3922
01:46:18,261 --> 01:46:18,800
they've been doing it.

3923
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:22,250
I think I would've gone out of my way
to make no big deal about it and they

3924
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:23,061
would have been included.

3925
01:46:23,061 --> 01:46:23,220
Yeah,

3926
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:23,750
but that's not,

3927
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:24,620
we're not talking about you.

3928
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:29,300
I talking about that sort of conversation
is a nonsense conversation and this is

3929
01:46:29,301 --> 01:46:32,360
going on over and over and over again
because those people are going to call

3930
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:34,070
Eric Weinstein was on my podcast.

3931
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:35,060
Winestein sorry.

3932
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:35,780
Yeah,

3933
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:36,980
not like Harvey Weinstein.

3934
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:40,850
Eric Weinstein brother Bret Weinstein
was on my podcast and he said,

3935
01:46:40,851 --> 01:46:42,290
here's how you know when you're in a cult,

3936
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:45,980
when you hear there is no biological
difference between men and women.

3937
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:48,440
You're in a cult that's
called [inaudible],

3938
01:46:48,530 --> 01:46:48,830
who's,

3939
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:50,190
who's that are common

3940
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,190
in colleges today.

3941
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:52,320
Colleges today,

3942
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:54,240
you're hearing it left
and right and a major,

3943
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:54,900
a major call,

3944
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,790
major universities in America.

3945
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:57,090
Yes,

3946
01:46:57,090 --> 01:46:57,923
in America,

3947
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:58,191
they're,

3948
01:46:58,191 --> 01:47:00,990
they're teaching this and people
were afraid to correct them.

3949
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:01,320
Why?

3950
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:03,150
They're afraid to say
anything different about it.

3951
01:47:03,151 --> 01:47:03,351
And,

3952
01:47:03,351 --> 01:47:04,590
and that's exactly right.

3953
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:05,460
And in fact,

3954
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:09,330
if you even say gender dysmorphia
was cause for you as far as,

3955
01:47:09,331 --> 01:47:09,541
sorry,

3956
01:47:09,541 --> 01:47:12,540
it was considered a mental
illness for a long time.

3957
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:16,590
Even to suggest that that may be us,

3958
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:18,300
a subset of the population.

3959
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,660
Maybe it's worth it.

3960
01:47:19,661 --> 01:47:20,041
It wouldn't.

3961
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:21,320
You have a child maybe.

3962
01:47:21,570 --> 01:47:24,240
Well if you have a child
who's thinking of themselves,

3963
01:47:24,241 --> 01:47:24,361
I,

3964
01:47:24,361 --> 01:47:24,481
I,

3965
01:47:24,481 --> 01:47:25,141
there are people,

3966
01:47:25,141 --> 01:47:27,000
Hollywood actors that are
having their children.

3967
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,313
I,

3968
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:29,400
from what I have heard,

3969
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:30,450
having seen this,

3970
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:34,770
what I've heard from people that I
know their kids are going through,

3971
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:36,270
they're getting horrible.

3972
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,880
I think hormone blockers.

3973
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:43,880
Owen Benjamin got a shit load of trouble
for talking about a guy who has a three

3974
01:47:43,981 --> 01:47:44,490
year old.

3975
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:47,040
That's how he's putting
through a hormonal blockers.

3976
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:50,870
And he was talking about how fucking
insane that people were barring owned

3977
01:47:50,871 --> 01:47:51,760
Benjamin from war.

3978
01:47:51,761 --> 01:47:52,400
Are you kidding?

3979
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:52,861
No,

3980
01:47:52,861 --> 01:47:53,250
I'm not.

3981
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:54,570
My own bedroom and guy,

3982
01:47:54,571 --> 01:47:55,020
by the way,

3983
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:56,040
he's just an animal.

3984
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,060
They own child.

3985
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:59,460
Let this child develop it's child abuse.

3986
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:03,600
If you cracked any legit doctors
who know anything about they go,

3987
01:48:03,601 --> 01:48:03,961
really,

3988
01:48:03,961 --> 01:48:06,600
we shouldn't be doing anything
to your past 21 years old.

3989
01:48:06,601 --> 01:48:10,650
We shouldn't be doing Amy then if you
want to do it to each of the text is not

3990
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:15,651
even fully developed for 25 that was
one thing he talked about 25 yeah,

3991
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,050
but Dave watershed date,

3992
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:22,260
there's some kids that at a very young
age are very adamant about the fact they

3993
01:48:22,261 --> 01:48:23,280
were born in the wrong body.

3994
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:23,911
And some of them,

3995
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:24,840
you look at them and you go,

3996
01:48:24,841 --> 01:48:25,051
well,

3997
01:48:25,051 --> 01:48:25,650
it makes sense,

3998
01:48:25,650 --> 01:48:25,980
right?

3999
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:28,530
So it's like who's right and who's
wrong and when do you decide?

4000
01:48:28,531 --> 01:48:29,640
But here's when you don't decide.

4001
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:31,380
Three three is crazy.

4002
01:48:31,450 --> 01:48:32,160
He's crazy.

4003
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:32,461
Three,

4004
01:48:32,461 --> 01:48:33,480
he should be put in jail.

4005
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:36,240
There's something wrong with our culture
where we think that that's a good idea

4006
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:40,650
to interfere with the hormonal system
of a very complex thing like as human

4007
01:48:40,651 --> 01:48:41,070
beings.

4008
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:43,500
Three that becomes this sort of,

4009
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:43,831
this,

4010
01:48:43,831 --> 01:48:44,131
this,

4011
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:44,690
this,

4012
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:45,390
um,

4013
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:46,230
the thing to do.

4014
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:49,140
Because if it was a thing that the CDC,

4015
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:49,801
what do is,

4016
01:48:49,801 --> 01:48:50,490
what does the kin,

4017
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:51,720
Canadian broadcast network,

4018
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:52,470
CBC,

4019
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:55,110
they didn't want to talk about a story.

4020
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:57,570
And I tweeted this a while back to this.

4021
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,200
They didn't,

4022
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:01,770
they didn't want to have a story on
about transgender children because they

4023
01:49:01,771 --> 01:49:06,771
showed that 85% of the kids that wanted
to be trans after a couple of years

4024
01:49:07,261 --> 01:49:08,094
changed their mind.

4025
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:11,580
There was a giant percentage of
these kids that went through a phase.

4026
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:11,971
You know,

4027
01:49:11,971 --> 01:49:12,661
Ruby rose,

4028
01:49:12,661 --> 01:49:13,620
that famous actress,

4029
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:14,760
I think she's a lesbian.

4030
01:49:14,761 --> 01:49:15,240
She's got,

4031
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:16,073
it's really pretty.

4032
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,330
She was in that John Wick two moving.

4033
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:22,320
She said that when she was young that
she had thought about being trans and

4034
01:49:22,321 --> 01:49:25,170
she's really happy that she
didn't actually go through
it with the hormones and

4035
01:49:25,171 --> 01:49:28,720
everything and now she realizes this
is just shown she just doesn't fit in.

4036
01:49:28,721 --> 01:49:29,700
And a lot of people don't,

4037
01:49:29,701 --> 01:49:33,840
they don't fit into what society has
in line for them in terms of a man or a

4038
01:49:33,841 --> 01:49:34,111
woman.

4039
01:49:34,111 --> 01:49:36,060
This binary one or zero,

4040
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:36,990
this old school.

4041
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:38,730
I also think that makes sense too.

4042
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:39,630
I also think a lot of the,

4043
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:40,493
the,

4044
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:44,550
the activism came out of a good place,

4045
01:49:44,551 --> 01:49:48,010
which was that a lot at 40% of people

4046
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,843
who have trans,

4047
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:51,070
a Trans Morphea,

4048
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:52,053
what is it?

4049
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:53,020
Gender dysphoria.

4050
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:53,950
You gotta get that right?

4051
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:54,740
Sorry.

4052
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:56,240
40% of the thing.

4053
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:58,210
You don't even commit that commit suicide.

4054
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:58,391
Well,

4055
01:49:58,391 --> 01:50:00,640
here's the thing you're not even
supposed to be doing by the way.

4056
01:50:00,641 --> 01:50:02,890
It doesn't have anything to do with
whether or not they have had surgery even

4057
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:03,461
ask you that.

4058
01:50:03,461 --> 01:50:04,294
I was going to ask you that.

4059
01:50:04,450 --> 01:50:06,670
I heard that after they have the surgery.

4060
01:50:06,671 --> 01:50:07,330
It doesn't,

4061
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:09,550
it doesn't actually change in that.

4062
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:10,150
No,

4063
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:10,983
it does.

4064
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:12,520
But the question is,

4065
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:13,330
is it,

4066
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:16,560
are they depressed because they haven't
been accepted but accepted as who's,

4067
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:17,800
who's who they really are.

4068
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:19,090
Yeah.

4069
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:22,960
And how society caused them to have
these irreparable scars and that's what's

4070
01:50:22,961 --> 01:50:24,610
led them to commit suicide ultimately.

4071
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:27,370
And it wasn't fixed by the surgery.

4072
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:28,720
Is that possible too?

4073
01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:32,950
Is it possible that we could be more
accepting as a society and as a culture?

4074
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:35,500
And then these people could just be
whoever the fuck they want to be.

4075
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:36,640
And that's all right too.

4076
01:50:36,641 --> 01:50:40,240
And maybe we would have a lower suicide
rate if it wasn't thought of with this

4077
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:41,403
great stigma.

4078
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:45,280
But you're not going to fix that by
having people like that go on TV and say

4079
01:50:45,281 --> 01:50:47,570
something that's a
blatant scientific lock.

4080
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:48,760
Like I sick in the head,

4081
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,270
like I should not be educating young
mind and people are coming out of those

4082
01:50:52,271 --> 01:50:52,780
schools.

4083
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:56,430
Thousands of people every day are
coming out adopting and these are called

4084
01:50:56,431 --> 01:51:00,430
cheese and cause my son date rebel against
their parents and their parents might

4085
01:51:00,431 --> 01:51:03,730
be some fucking right wing
square jawed knucklehead,

4086
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,241
you know,

4087
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:08,350
that has some stupid ideas about
what a man is and what a woman is.

4088
01:51:08,351 --> 01:51:08,701
And it is.

4089
01:51:08,701 --> 01:51:09,521
And God says,

4090
01:51:09,521 --> 01:51:11,080
man shall not lawyer Dude,

4091
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:16,081
studios and directors get massive heat
for not having transgender actors and

4092
01:51:18,341 --> 01:51:19,480
stars and all that.

4093
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:20,890
And there's this index.

4094
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:24,100
How many lines did women save
versus how many lines in men,

4095
01:51:24,130 --> 01:51:27,460
how many female strong
characters are right?

4096
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:29,350
But here's the thing you do.

4097
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:30,131
Do you know about this,

4098
01:51:30,131 --> 01:51:30,460
uh,

4099
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:31,293
cover?

4100
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:31,840
Um,

4101
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,870
with all these women,

4102
01:51:32,871 --> 01:51:35,240
and they were talking about
inclusivity and about,

4103
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:37,000
is it on time now I forget.

4104
01:51:37,001 --> 01:51:38,260
Vanity Fair or something like that.

4105
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:38,681
It's different.

4106
01:51:38,681 --> 01:51:39,730
It's a different magazines.

4107
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:40,950
It was all white.

4108
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:41,181
I don't know.

4109
01:51:41,181 --> 01:51:42,014
But it's all white.

4110
01:51:42,590 --> 01:51:43,990
All white women.

4111
01:51:43,991 --> 01:51:45,580
Like how has this diversity,

4112
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:46,990
like you're all white women,

4113
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:48,670
you're not even playing by your own rules.

4114
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:49,541
A lot of shit for it.

4115
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:50,890
They should get a lot of shit for it.

4116
01:51:50,891 --> 01:51:52,690
Whoever the fuck let that slip through.

4117
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:53,680
Like what are,

4118
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:54,970
what message are you trying to send?

4119
01:51:54,971 --> 01:51:58,900
You said you were saying is this an anti
male message because user or you're a

4120
01:51:58,901 --> 01:51:59,680
bunch of white women,

4121
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:00,280
but you know,

4122
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,520
now you're getting into this.

4123
01:52:01,630 --> 01:52:05,410
My favorite fucking
favorite new discipline,

4124
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:07,300
which is intersections.

4125
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:10,750
Feminism don't know what it is.

4126
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:12,220
It's the best.

4127
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:13,000
It's the best.

4128
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:13,833
So when,

4129
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:14,170
when,

4130
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:17,440
when did with the feminist movement really
began with white women and I think it

4131
01:52:17,441 --> 01:52:17,861
started in the,

4132
01:52:17,861 --> 01:52:18,970
in the women's studies department,

4133
01:52:18,971 --> 01:52:20,050
or at least the literature department,

4134
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:21,190
Yale University.

4135
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:22,990
And they had,

4136
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:23,981
they did some work,

4137
01:52:23,981 --> 01:52:24,281
man,

4138
01:52:24,281 --> 01:52:24,370
they,

4139
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:25,820
those women were serious and,

4140
01:52:25,821 --> 01:52:28,600
and you can't say that the feminist
movement didn't have something to say and,

4141
01:52:28,601 --> 01:52:29,411
and have some work to do.

4142
01:52:29,411 --> 01:52:30,244
Of course it did.

4143
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:31,630
A smart women were like,

4144
01:52:31,631 --> 01:52:32,770
I don't fucking want to be,

4145
01:52:32,771 --> 01:52:33,130
you know,

4146
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:35,290
there are some issues and disparity,

4147
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:39,640
but what happens with any
movement is that it's like,

4148
01:52:39,641 --> 01:52:39,881
well,

4149
01:52:39,881 --> 01:52:40,870
we're white women.

4150
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:43,000
What about black women?

4151
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:44,080
They,

4152
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,740
they have it way worse than we do.

4153
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:47,303
And what about,

4154
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:48,680
and we can just keep extrapolating.

4155
01:52:48,681 --> 01:52:50,690
What about black women with allergies?

4156
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:51,920
Black women with Lupus.

4157
01:52:51,921 --> 01:52:52,640
How about,

4158
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:56,690
what about black women who come from
really poor and violent areas versus black

4159
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:58,280
women to come from a better area?

4160
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,950
What about black women who are midgets?

4161
01:53:01,070 --> 01:53:02,450
They're d you can keep,

4162
01:53:03,190 --> 01:53:04,510
I know little purses,

4163
01:53:04,511 --> 01:53:05,181
small people.

4164
01:53:05,181 --> 01:53:06,190
You can just keep time.

4165
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,210
So often top,

4166
01:53:08,211 --> 01:53:08,781
sorry buddy.

4167
01:53:08,781 --> 01:53:09,290
God.

4168
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:13,700
The top at the top of the
sort of power structure.

4169
01:53:13,701 --> 01:53:17,420
Now the inverted power structure is
people that are the most oppressed.

4170
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:19,160
They're the voices that
have to be heard the most.

4171
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:23,720
The problem with breaking this down
into all these sections is you get

4172
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:24,950
ultimately to,

4173
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,600
cause when they had this huge,

4174
01:53:26,601 --> 01:53:27,620
Christine Summers talks about this,

4175
01:53:27,621 --> 01:53:30,110
they had this huge intersection hist,

4176
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:33,980
feminist sort of congregation
where all these women got together,

4177
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:36,500
but in the group when they were
meeting in the convention center,

4178
01:53:36,501 --> 01:53:37,580
they started breaking up.

4179
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:38,660
They started breaking up,

4180
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,020
oops.

4181
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:39,201
Oh,

4182
01:53:39,201 --> 01:53:39,771
they were breaking up.

4183
01:53:39,771 --> 01:53:40,220
They're like,

4184
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:40,401
well,

4185
01:53:40,401 --> 01:53:41,450
we have allergies,

4186
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,100
so we're not over there,

4187
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:43,581
and he,

4188
01:53:43,581 --> 01:53:43,911
by the way,

4189
01:53:43,911 --> 01:53:44,670
you're black,

4190
01:53:44,670 --> 01:53:45,470
you're white,

4191
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:46,071
you're a feminist,

4192
01:53:46,071 --> 01:53:47,080
but you date you're white,

4193
01:53:47,090 --> 01:53:47,901
black feminists,

4194
01:53:47,901 --> 01:53:48,440
but you also,

4195
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,340
you date a white woman.

4196
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,120
Sorry,

4197
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:50,870
you're a little more privileged.

4198
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:52,170
You got to go over there
in the midgets rovers,

4199
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:53,510
so it became this.

4200
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,460
If you get one click after another,

4201
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:57,070
that's crazy that women become cliquey.

4202
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,070
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

4203
01:53:58,130 --> 01:54:00,020
You want to know my favorite
stories in regards to those.

4204
01:54:00,021 --> 01:54:01,120
Let me just finish this one story.

4205
01:54:01,690 --> 01:54:05,480
The problem with that movement
is as you keep extrapolating,

4206
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:08,210
you get to what's called the individual.

4207
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:11,750
The founding fathers figured
that out a long time ago.

4208
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:15,350
Ultimately you're going to get down to
the fact that you should treat everybody

4209
01:54:15,351 --> 01:54:16,460
as the thing,

4210
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:17,660
as an individual.

4211
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:20,750
I like it as an individual.

4212
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:22,310
That's the whole point.

4213
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:23,181
That's that.

4214
01:54:23,181 --> 01:54:23,960
Yes,

4215
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:25,130
you can keep going,

4216
01:54:25,131 --> 01:54:26,360
but if you keep playing that game,

4217
01:54:26,361 --> 01:54:28,370
you're just going to get down
to everybody's different.

4218
01:54:28,371 --> 01:54:29,720
Everybody has something.

4219
01:54:29,721 --> 01:54:31,400
Everybody is a white dude.

4220
01:54:31,401 --> 01:54:34,970
My buddy Dave Holly has a
spine like this and he's,

4221
01:54:34,971 --> 01:54:37,130
he's going to die unless
he gets an operation.

4222
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:38,090
His life sucks.

4223
01:54:38,091 --> 01:54:38,881
He's about that big.

4224
01:54:38,881 --> 01:54:40,620
His email is no neck day.

4225
01:54:40,621 --> 01:54:41,331
If I say I love him,

4226
01:54:41,331 --> 01:54:42,290
he's fucking hilarious.

4227
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:43,153
Dave Ali,

4228
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:44,540
but Dave is white.

4229
01:54:44,541 --> 01:54:45,530
He ate privileged.

4230
01:54:45,650 --> 01:54:46,291
He came from home.

4231
01:54:46,291 --> 01:54:47,031
Mormon family,

4232
01:54:47,031 --> 01:54:47,811
a large family.

4233
01:54:47,811 --> 01:54:48,430
He wasn't.

4234
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:48,691
You know,

4235
01:54:48,691 --> 01:54:50,630
his life has not been fucking easy.

4236
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,720
He can't breathe so you
can keep extrapolating.

4237
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:56,630
That's why you treat people as individuals
because you don't know anything about

4238
01:54:56,631 --> 01:54:56,751
them.

4239
01:54:56,751 --> 01:54:58,790
You actually don't know anything
about what they've come through.

4240
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,350
It could be a great looking guy,

4241
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:01,243
sleeve tattoo,

4242
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:05,480
nonsense conversation because what
they're really trying to do is establish

4243
01:55:05,481 --> 01:55:08,480
power structures and they want to have
power over the rest of the people.

4244
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:11,960
In the group because they apparently
have more things that are going against

4245
01:55:11,961 --> 01:55:12,320
the,

4246
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:17,320
as you were going to say that my favorite
story is there was a an all girls

4247
01:55:17,991 --> 01:55:22,130
college and this woman is running for
president of Student Council and she

4248
01:55:22,131 --> 01:55:24,260
decides that she's a male.

4249
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,480
She decides to change her gender and uh,

4250
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:28,790
then the fucking kiss,

4251
01:55:28,791 --> 01:55:29,820
she didn't get an operation though.

4252
01:55:29,910 --> 01:55:30,071
No,

4253
01:55:30,071 --> 01:55:30,170
no,

4254
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:30,381
no.

4255
01:55:30,381 --> 01:55:35,381
She just decided she was a masculine of
center of centered gender queer was how

4256
01:55:36,021 --> 01:55:39,860
she described herself card by decided
to change her name to a male's name.

4257
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:42,710
Then the women in the school,

4258
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:44,130
we're against

4259
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:48,870
her because she is now a white man and
the white man is the patriarchy and she,

4260
01:55:48,871 --> 01:55:52,620
it was the president of
diversity or something like that.

4261
01:55:52,621 --> 01:55:55,640
Like some student council
becomes of class madness,

4262
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:56,710
diversity.

4263
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:57,600
She'd go back.

4264
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:58,673
I do not know.

4265
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:00,060
I do not know.

4266
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:01,200
Somebody sent me something about that.

4267
01:56:01,201 --> 01:56:05,390
How somebody said something about
colleges had become these specialized,

4268
01:56:05,391 --> 01:56:09,600
they're specialized in subjects
that have increasing irrelevance.

4269
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:11,731
Yeah.

4270
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:11,981
It's,

4271
01:56:11,981 --> 01:56:13,110
it's a weird thing man.

4272
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:18,380
I think people automatically have
this desire to stand out and be more

4273
01:56:18,571 --> 01:56:19,080
important.

4274
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,070
They automatically too.

4275
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:23,250
So it's like a common thing and they
can do it through merit but merit.

4276
01:56:23,251 --> 01:56:23,941
It's difficult.

4277
01:56:23,941 --> 01:56:25,110
Meritocracies are hard.

4278
01:56:25,111 --> 01:56:30,111
You might fall short and sometimes you
in along the way you see your meritocracy

4279
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:32,010
like not working out for you.

4280
01:56:32,011 --> 01:56:32,240
You'll,

4281
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:35,850
you'll claim there's some sort of a
conspiracy against you and there might be

4282
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:36,871
cute claims,

4283
01:56:36,871 --> 01:56:38,800
other people of privilege
and they might eat.

4284
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:42,300
You'll claim all of these reasons why
you're not getting ahead and you might be

4285
01:56:42,301 --> 01:56:42,660
right.

4286
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:45,710
You might be right in some ways
because colleges are like the thorn.

4287
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:49,520
A lot of comics not doing the tours
anymore or when they call just

4288
01:56:51,030 --> 01:56:55,020
before a lot of comics were doing
cause stopped way before this,

4289
01:56:55,021 --> 01:56:58,190
I stopped the colleges and the early
two thousands for that very reason.

4290
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:02,520
For that reason there were just way
too sensitive and they didn't have life

4291
01:57:02,521 --> 01:57:03,354
experience.

4292
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:07,560
The problem is I like talking to people
that have bills and jobs and people that

4293
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:10,590
have relationships that didn't work out
so good and now they have a fucking kid,

4294
01:57:10,591 --> 01:57:11,640
but some lady who hates him.

4295
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:12,720
That's my crowd.

4296
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,410
I know John People,

4297
01:57:16,290 --> 01:57:18,060
I like talking to people that owe taxes,

4298
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:20,700
spending their fucking money,

4299
01:57:20,701 --> 01:57:22,230
trying to figure out what
they're doing in their life.

4300
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,630
They want to talk about meritocracy
is my favorite meritocracies there.

4301
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:27,540
How you you find out who is real,

4302
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:29,130
who really deserves it.

4303
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:30,690
You don't do colleges anymore either.

4304
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:32,190
Deep down I don't,

4305
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:36,000
it's just not a smart thing to do because
those people in those colleges are,

4306
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:36,991
they're very,

4307
01:57:36,991 --> 01:57:37,800
very young.

4308
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:39,060
You're dealing with 19 year olds,

4309
01:57:39,061 --> 01:57:39,661
20 year olds,

4310
01:57:39,661 --> 01:57:41,700
and they're in this
weird ideological bubble.

4311
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:42,181
You know,

4312
01:57:42,181 --> 01:57:45,300
there's all these fucking peel that are
just jammed in together in this group

4313
01:57:45,301 --> 01:57:48,390
and everybody's trying to stand out and
weird and unique ways and there's people

4314
01:57:48,391 --> 01:57:52,320
that are doing it by claiming their
masculine of center gender queer and

4315
01:57:52,321 --> 01:57:53,880
changing their name and wow,

4316
01:57:53,881 --> 01:57:54,631
you're so unique.

4317
01:57:54,631 --> 01:57:55,464
You're so amazing.

4318
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:58,350
And there's also people that are doing
it because they're trying to buck that

4319
01:57:58,351 --> 01:57:58,800
system.

4320
01:57:58,800 --> 01:57:59,500
They're becoming the,

4321
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:02,310
the Republicans on campus and
people are calling them Nazis.

4322
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:02,761
You know,

4323
01:58:02,761 --> 01:58:05,460
there's a lot of a fucking shoe
palace should be talks about that.

4324
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:08,250
And especially with
someone rushed the stage.

4325
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:10,260
We've suffered as much
as you and he's like,

4326
01:58:10,261 --> 01:58:11,094
hold on,

4327
01:58:11,150 --> 01:58:12,780
you're a white woman to take it easy.

4328
01:58:12,890 --> 01:58:17,720
Now you've suffered thought like
we've suffered as much as you to.

4329
01:58:17,730 --> 01:58:19,470
How does that invalidate
this person's suffering?

4330
01:58:19,471 --> 01:58:21,510
If someone's on stage talking
about their suffering,

4331
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:22,191
yours did the,

4332
01:58:22,191 --> 01:58:22,401
the,

4333
01:58:22,401 --> 01:58:25,380
the nature of your suffering is invalid.

4334
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:27,300
It's not relevant.

4335
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:27,800
You,

4336
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:28,120
you,

4337
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,700
you can relate to that person.

4338
01:58:29,701 --> 01:58:30,271
Not Relate,

4339
01:58:30,271 --> 01:58:33,780
but the fact that you can stop them from
talking or that you think you can stop

4340
01:58:33,781 --> 01:58:36,270
them from talking just cause
you've suffered yourself as well.

4341
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,260
Like what did that mean?

4342
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:37,470
No,

4343
01:58:37,470 --> 01:58:39,690
you're there for fucking audience.

4344
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:40,890
You're an audience member.

4345
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:41,230
You're,

4346
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:42,820
your job is to sit down and listen.

4347
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:44,590
If you want to be a performer,

4348
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:46,150
well you need to fucking get an act.

4349
01:58:46,151 --> 01:58:47,200
You need to get booked at the club.

4350
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,340
You need to become professional.

4351
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:49,750
Have people come and pay to see you,

4352
01:58:49,751 --> 01:58:51,040
and then you can express yourself.

4353
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:55,450
You're violating the audience
versus performer rules.

4354
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:57,190
I also think that people
who are that sensitive,

4355
01:58:57,191 --> 01:58:57,881
they don't really,

4356
01:58:57,881 --> 01:58:58,360
they haven't,

4357
01:58:58,360 --> 01:58:59,020
they don't.

4358
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:02,650
They haven't really figured out what they
believe and they don't really believe

4359
01:59:02,651 --> 01:59:03,251
in what they're saying.

4360
01:59:03,251 --> 01:59:06,640
They just belong to a group and
they like being a good foot soldier.

4361
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:10,810
They haven't really thought out
why they haven't been challenged.

4362
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:12,070
They might've thought it out,

4363
01:59:12,071 --> 01:59:14,440
but they've been thought about with a
bunch of other people that are thinking

4364
01:59:14,441 --> 01:59:16,630
the same things that they
think they felt it out.

4365
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:17,710
It feels right.

4366
01:59:17,711 --> 01:59:18,131
It doesn't,

4367
01:59:18,131 --> 01:59:21,160
it's not thought well she's getting
data on the live comedy show.

4368
01:59:21,161 --> 01:59:23,120
She has some serious issues going on.

4369
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:24,430
She rushed the stage.

4370
01:59:24,570 --> 01:59:25,091
That's a good point.

4371
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:25,630
Like fat,

4372
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:26,830
like fat shaming.

4373
01:59:27,390 --> 01:59:27,640
Yeah.

4374
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:28,510
There's another thing.

4375
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:29,403
Fat Shaming.

4376
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:29,770
Yeah,

4377
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:31,060
a very similar thing.

4378
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:33,730
Like you're not supposed to talk about
people being overweight and I was talking

4379
01:59:33,731 --> 01:59:34,750
about people being fat.

4380
01:59:34,751 --> 01:59:37,540
You're not supposed to discuss
it as being a real health issue,

4381
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:38,573
that you're fat.

4382
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:39,790
You're fat shaming them.

4383
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:41,260
You talk about reality.

4384
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:44,590
You're talking about your friend with
his bad back and is fucked up spine and

4385
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:47,260
has a hard time breathing
and like seriously,

4386
01:59:47,261 --> 01:59:48,910
like from the jump,

4387
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:49,793
right?

4388
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:50,753
Yeah,

4389
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:51,490
you can.

4390
01:59:51,490 --> 01:59:52,630
That's just a reality.

4391
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,430
But there'll be more weight.

4392
01:59:54,431 --> 01:59:55,264
Same thing,

4393
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:55,810
but it's,

4394
01:59:55,810 --> 01:59:59,820
it's worse because it's by
decisions that they've made.

4395
01:59:59,821 --> 02:00:01,360
It's allowed them to get that big.

4396
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:03,310
If you just decided to not eat,

4397
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:03,910
that is a,

4398
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:05,560
that is a possible answer.

4399
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:07,110
Now we go back to determinism.

4400
02:00:07,111 --> 02:00:07,300
Right.

4401
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:08,650
Then how much of your life is,

4402
02:00:08,651 --> 02:00:09,484
you're a beautiful man.

4403
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:11,170
You're fine.

4404
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:12,520
We have suffered more than you,

4405
02:00:12,521 --> 02:00:13,354
Brandon,

4406
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:14,680
but if you go back to,

4407
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:19,030
you know what we're talking about
about determinism mean is is your life,

4408
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:23,560
are you right now in the middle of
conscious decision making is shaping your

4409
02:00:23,561 --> 02:00:26,500
destiny or are you a product
of all your life experiences?

4410
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:28,780
All of the input that you've received,

4411
02:00:28,781 --> 02:00:31,270
your genetics and some
days it's a very dangerous,

4412
02:00:31,271 --> 02:00:35,980
scary area because I don't like taking
personal responsibility away from people.

4413
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:36,970
I don't like it either,

4414
02:00:36,971 --> 02:00:38,860
but the reality about human bodies,

4415
02:00:38,861 --> 02:00:40,750
and Rhonda Patrick was talking
about this the other day,

4416
02:00:41,050 --> 02:00:45,970
morbidly obese people have differences
in their sperm that is transferred onto

4417
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:47,290
onto their children.

4418
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:48,130
That is,

4419
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:49,240
that does not exist.

4420
02:00:49,241 --> 02:00:50,650
When that person loses the weight speak.

4421
02:00:50,651 --> 02:00:52,420
It would be when a
person loses the weight.

4422
02:00:52,470 --> 02:00:52,890
Yeah.

4423
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:56,740
Though that all those
genetic problems go away.

4424
02:00:56,770 --> 02:00:58,510
So that did reverse himself that.

4425
02:00:58,540 --> 02:00:59,890
Then that raises another question.

4426
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:05,110
If you do have a genetic propensity
for whatever it might be,

4427
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:06,273
gambling,

4428
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:07,683
alcoholism.

4429
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:08,201
Yeah,

4430
02:01:08,201 --> 02:01:09,020
obesity.

4431
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:09,490
It,

4432
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:11,470
it doesn't mean as a human being,

4433
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:14,860
you can't figure out a way to

4434
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:21,190
game the system so that you
don't fall victim to it,

4435
02:01:21,191 --> 02:01:21,850
and we have to,

4436
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:26,500
we have to keep that open as a possibility
so that my freewill counts for a lot.

4437
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:28,960
It was Rhonda Patrick Send all
the fatties in another place,

4438
02:01:28,961 --> 02:01:32,530
but it was run a peptic
saying that obesity is a,

4439
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:33,970
it's passed down.

4440
02:01:34,030 --> 02:01:34,600
Yes.

4441
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:35,110
Oh Wow.

4442
02:01:35,110 --> 02:01:40,110
She was saying that the genes that
are problematic amongst obese people,

4443
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:41,960
those jeans,

4444
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:44,720
they change when the
person loses the weight.

4445
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:49,160
So even if a person has gastric bypass
surgery and they lose the way and they

4446
02:01:49,161 --> 02:01:51,620
get down to a normal way where
they're not obese anymore,

4447
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:55,760
their genes that they express and the
way they transfer them to their children,

4448
02:01:55,761 --> 02:01:56,630
they will be different.

4449
02:01:57,740 --> 02:01:59,420
Meaning the children whose kids have it.

4450
02:01:59,450 --> 02:01:59,940
Yes.

4451
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:00,150
Cool.

4452
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:00,820
He's skinny.

4453
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:02,030
I had Al Roker is fine.

4454
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:05,390
I have a friend who's overweight and
he has a daughter that's overweight and

4455
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:05,900
it's,

4456
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:06,650
and she's,

4457
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:07,340
you know,

4458
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:08,990
like approaching teenage years.

4459
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:11,390
She's thick and now she's overweight.

4460
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:16,190
She and shuts off and she drinks tons
of soda and she eats tons of candy and

4461
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:17,120
he's not a good friend.

4462
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:18,140
He's just a guy that I know.

4463
02:02:18,410 --> 02:02:19,250
And um,

4464
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:20,690
it's,

4465
02:02:20,690 --> 02:02:22,430
it's weird to watch cause it's like,

4466
02:02:22,431 --> 02:02:24,520
well I see where this is going.

4467
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:26,210
He's not educated on nutrition.

4468
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:26,740
No,

4469
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:27,620
no he's not.

4470
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:29,781
He's not a thinker.

4471
02:02:29,781 --> 02:02:30,111
He doesn't,

4472
02:02:30,111 --> 02:02:32,330
I don't know the guy
well enough to the comp.

4473
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:34,130
Obviously I would never comment on,

4474
02:02:34,131 --> 02:02:34,281
hey,

4475
02:02:34,281 --> 02:02:36,080
you got to treat your fucking kid better.

4476
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:39,140
But I see the kid and I'd see
the thing and I'd just like,

4477
02:02:39,141 --> 02:02:39,951
Jesus Christ,

4478
02:02:39,951 --> 02:02:40,760
this kid's fucked.

4479
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:42,620
Sometimes when they're happy
and they're fat though,

4480
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:43,320
I appreciate it.

4481
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:44,153
Cause unhappy.

4482
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:45,260
So it's not a good,

4483
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:46,393
it's just,

4484
02:02:46,630 --> 02:02:47,080
it's a,

4485
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:48,320
it's one of those things where,

4486
02:02:48,410 --> 02:02:49,071
you know,

4487
02:02:49,071 --> 02:02:52,640
if you make choices and then your children
see those choices and make those same

4488
02:02:52,641 --> 02:02:53,474
choices,

4489
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:54,680
you know,

4490
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:59,030
you're responsible for passing that
pattern on and some sort of a way.

4491
02:02:59,031 --> 02:03:02,000
And sometimes people don't realize that
until someone like Rhonda Patrick says

4492
02:03:02,001 --> 02:03:02,570
it.

4493
02:03:02,570 --> 02:03:06,140
And one of the things that Rhonda sent
me was an email that she had gotten where

4494
02:03:06,141 --> 02:03:07,220
someone sent to her.

4495
02:03:07,270 --> 02:03:07,610
Um,

4496
02:03:07,610 --> 02:03:09,920
this guy that was literally
listening to that,

4497
02:03:09,921 --> 02:03:13,670
eating some shitty food and put it down
and decided there and then to make a

4498
02:03:13,671 --> 02:03:14,421
change in his life.

4499
02:03:14,421 --> 02:03:14,691
He's like,

4500
02:03:14,691 --> 02:03:18,380
I didn't even think that this was going
to literally change my jeans that I pass

4501
02:03:18,381 --> 02:03:19,091
onto my children.

4502
02:03:19,091 --> 02:03:19,910
That's really cool.

4503
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:20,161
Wow,

4504
02:03:20,161 --> 02:03:20,790
that's cool.

4505
02:03:20,790 --> 02:03:24,920
The more you learn about
stuff out of your destiny,

4506
02:03:24,921 --> 02:03:26,240
but maybe your children's destiny.

4507
02:03:26,241 --> 02:03:26,600
Yeah.

4508
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:28,160
Some people just don't know more.

4509
02:03:28,161 --> 02:03:28,360
You're,

4510
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:28,911
you're not just,

4511
02:03:28,911 --> 02:03:29,201
you're,

4512
02:03:29,201 --> 02:03:31,610
you're literally
hamstringing them from birth.

4513
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:32,570
You,

4514
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:35,600
if you're a fat fuck and you
have these kids are fat shaming,

4515
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:37,580
you let let it out of the gate,

4516
02:03:37,790 --> 02:03:38,061
you know,

4517
02:03:38,061 --> 02:03:39,210
and your children from,

4518
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:42,950
from the jump or dealing with all your
poor choices and you have to see that

4519
02:03:42,951 --> 02:03:43,910
that's going to punish you.

4520
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:44,290
Ma'Am.

4521
02:03:44,290 --> 02:03:45,111
A lot of it's education.

4522
02:03:45,111 --> 02:03:46,340
A lot of people just didn't know that.

4523
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:46,970
You know,

4524
02:03:46,970 --> 02:03:48,860
we used to be like high fiber,

4525
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:49,850
low fat diets.

4526
02:03:49,851 --> 02:03:51,860
How you lose weight and
people couldn't lose weight.

4527
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:52,611
Then they were like,

4528
02:03:52,611 --> 02:03:55,790
try not eating sugar and bread and
things that spike your insulin.

4529
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:57,080
Some people who are obese,

4530
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:01,850
are they saying it's maybe a mental
weakness or is it a mental illness?

4531
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:02,181
No,

4532
02:04:02,181 --> 02:04:03,014
they're saying,

4533
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:08,110
well it's certainly everyone has
the ability to do things different.

4534
02:04:08,241 --> 02:04:13,241
Like nothing stopping you from
just cutting all the bad carbs out,

4535
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:15,380
cutting all the refined sugar,

4536
02:04:15,381 --> 02:04:16,820
cutting all the refined carbohydrates,

4537
02:04:16,821 --> 02:04:21,650
eating like a very healthy diet and then
working out all the time and slowly but

4538
02:04:21,651 --> 02:04:23,510
surely losing the weight
and becoming healthy.

4539
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:25,670
Nothing is physically
stopping you from doing that.

4540
02:04:25,671 --> 02:04:26,210
Right?

4541
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:27,350
So what is stopping and,

4542
02:04:27,351 --> 02:04:27,441
well,

4543
02:04:27,441 --> 02:04:29,240
there's a lot of behavior
patterns that people deal,

4544
02:04:29,241 --> 02:04:30,470
which is a lot of depression.

4545
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:31,431
There's addiction.

4546
02:04:31,431 --> 02:04:32,660
Like what are those mechanisms?

4547
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:34,970
And these are all things
that we need to address to,

4548
02:04:34,971 --> 02:04:35,631
you can't just say,

4549
02:04:35,631 --> 02:04:36,081
hey man,

4550
02:04:36,081 --> 02:04:37,710
pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

4551
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:39,180
Cause people don't know how to do it.

4552
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:40,073
How do I get it?

4553
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:40,770
Yeah.

4554
02:04:40,770 --> 02:04:41,040
Yeah.

4555
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:41,970
How do they get out of their own way?

4556
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:42,691
They get depressed.

4557
02:04:42,691 --> 02:04:43,650
They feel terrible.

4558
02:04:43,651 --> 02:04:45,180
They feel maligned by society.

4559
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:46,800
But I don't think helping them.

4560
02:04:46,801 --> 02:04:50,070
I don't think you can help them by
saying you're fat shaming them by talking

4561
02:04:50,071 --> 02:04:52,270
about the fact that being fat is gross.

4562
02:04:52,271 --> 02:04:53,104
Yeah,

4563
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:53,700
exactly.

4564
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:54,570
It's just bad for you.

4565
02:04:54,580 --> 02:04:55,580
It's going to do it anyway.

4566
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:55,980
Yeah.

4567
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:56,813
The world's going to do it.

4568
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:58,930
Quiet this.

4569
02:05:00,490 --> 02:05:01,500
This is my problem with the,

4570
02:05:01,501 --> 02:05:02,334
the the,

4571
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:03,990
the side.

4572
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:07,140
It's the right on the left
actually on the fringes.

4573
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:10,500
They're way more interested in
punishment than they are persuasion.

4574
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:11,580
You know?

4575
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:14,160
I know that we can pass lots of laws.

4576
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:18,530
I know we can have workplace stuff that
kind of like makes everybody safer,

4577
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:19,403
quote unquote.

4578
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:21,660
It's just going to suppress behavior.

4579
02:05:21,661 --> 02:05:23,190
It's not going to change behavior.

4580
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:24,720
You need to figure out a way,

4581
02:05:24,721 --> 02:05:26,820
if you really serious
about changing behavior,

4582
02:05:26,821 --> 02:05:30,150
appeal to my heart and my mind and my and,

4583
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:30,451
and,

4584
02:05:30,451 --> 02:05:31,500
and make it logical.

4585
02:05:32,010 --> 02:05:33,540
When you teach me how to eat,

4586
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:38,370
they're the biggest tissue I always find
with keeping people motivated is number

4587
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:38,760
one.

4588
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:39,593
They,

4589
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:40,673
they just,

4590
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:41,281
they can get,

4591
02:05:41,281 --> 02:05:42,540
you can get pumped up,

4592
02:05:42,541 --> 02:05:46,800
you can go to a Tony Robbins seminar and
get pumped up and really make a change.

4593
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:50,340
The question is how do you
keep inspired day to day?

4594
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:51,350
How do you stay in,

4595
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:51,540
you know,

4596
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:53,220
that comment about inspiration,

4597
02:05:53,221 --> 02:05:53,761
that inspiration.

4598
02:05:53,761 --> 02:05:54,594
It's like bathing.

4599
02:05:54,810 --> 02:05:55,471
It's effective,

4600
02:05:55,471 --> 02:05:56,730
but it has to be done regularly.

4601
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:57,250
Yeah.

4602
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:57,481
Yeah.

4603
02:05:57,481 --> 02:05:57,840
That's good.

4604
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:58,560
Yes.

4605
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,960
I think community and information,

4606
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:04,470
these two are huge and you have to be
around like minded people that also want

4607
02:06:04,471 --> 02:06:05,304
to do the same thing.

4608
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:07,530
That helps when you're
around fucking lazy.

4609
02:06:07,531 --> 02:06:08,160
Cons,

4610
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:09,140
who don't want to do shit,

4611
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:10,170
they're always making excuses.

4612
02:06:10,171 --> 02:06:11,250
It fucking trips you up.

4613
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:12,113
It's real sad.

4614
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:14,340
So if you have friends that
are always making excuses,

4615
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:15,030
you got to,

4616
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:16,080
you got to push them away.

4617
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:17,580
You've got to separate
and you just tell him,

4618
02:06:17,581 --> 02:06:18,001
hey man,

4619
02:06:18,001 --> 02:06:18,840
this is how I feel.

4620
02:06:18,990 --> 02:06:21,390
I feel like you're always crying about
stuff and you're always thinking,

4621
02:06:21,391 --> 02:06:22,520
woe is me and you,

4622
02:06:22,521 --> 02:06:22,730
you,

4623
02:06:22,730 --> 02:06:25,890
you trip us all up and if
you don't get of clown,

4624
02:06:26,010 --> 02:06:29,310
he give him the opportunity to
see how you see them and if not,

4625
02:06:29,311 --> 02:06:32,850
you've got to find other people that are
more motivated to improve their life.

4626
02:06:32,970 --> 02:06:36,990
Then inflammation and in
community and information.

4627
02:06:36,991 --> 02:06:39,120
I also include things like this podcast,

4628
02:06:39,150 --> 02:06:39,780
any con,

4629
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:42,150
any time people are
talking about these things,

4630
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:43,253
uninhibited,

4631
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:44,220
uninterrupted,

4632
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:45,510
and uncensored.

4633
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:45,781
Well,

4634
02:06:45,781 --> 02:06:49,710
you get to see the real thoughts
that they have and then backed up by

4635
02:06:49,711 --> 02:06:52,500
information from people like
Rhonda Patrick from scientists,

4636
02:06:52,501 --> 02:06:53,940
from peer reviewed studies,

4637
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:54,870
things that you read.

4638
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:56,790
You get a sense of like,

4639
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:57,061
oh,

4640
02:06:57,061 --> 02:06:58,170
I'm not alone in this.

4641
02:06:58,350 --> 02:06:58,651
Okay.

4642
02:06:58,651 --> 02:07:00,930
There's a bunch of other people that
are thinking about these issues as well,

4643
02:07:01,110 --> 02:07:02,190
like what can we do?

4644
02:07:02,191 --> 02:07:06,780
What can I do on a personal level to get
past whatever weird shit I'm tripping

4645
02:07:06,781 --> 02:07:07,620
up on my life?

4646
02:07:07,810 --> 02:07:08,120
How?

4647
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:08,331
How?

4648
02:07:08,331 --> 02:07:09,630
Why do I keep smoking cigarettes?

4649
02:07:09,631 --> 02:07:11,220
Why do I keep lighten
these fucking things up?

4650
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:12,240
How come after work?

4651
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:14,370
I just go for the ice cubes
and start pouring scotch.

4652
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:15,330
Why do I do that?

4653
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:16,110
Why do I do that?

4654
02:07:16,110 --> 02:07:20,190
And all these people have to come to
grips with this and having a community of

4655
02:07:20,191 --> 02:07:24,150
people like I learned a shit load
when we did that sober October thing,

4656
02:07:24,151 --> 02:07:24,420
man,

4657
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:26,820
I learned a shit load because I don't,

4658
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:29,160
I don't have a drinking problem,

4659
02:07:29,161 --> 02:07:30,930
but knowing that I can't drink,

4660
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:35,860
it's like inhibiting myself from that
no smoking and then also having these 15

4661
02:07:35,861 --> 02:07:38,950
fucking yoga classes that we had to
do 90 minute yoga classes in a month.

4662
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:40,330
It was a lot of everything,

4663
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:42,520
but it was also that we
were doing it together,

4664
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:43,531
that Burt was doing it.

4665
02:07:43,531 --> 02:07:44,230
Tom Is doing it,

4666
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:44,431
art,

4667
02:07:44,431 --> 02:07:44,950
he was doing it.

4668
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:45,491
I was doing it.

4669
02:07:45,491 --> 02:07:46,360
We're all doing it together.

4670
02:07:46,361 --> 02:07:50,110
We fed off of each other and at the end
of it when we were all celebrating and

4671
02:07:50,111 --> 02:07:50,561
got through it,

4672
02:07:50,561 --> 02:07:51,030
I was like,

4673
02:07:51,030 --> 02:07:52,300
I learned a lot from this.

4674
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:56,020
I learned a lot from this about the
power of community will learn a lot from

4675
02:07:56,021 --> 02:07:57,940
this about having things
that you have to do,

4676
02:07:58,120 --> 02:07:58,541
like there's,

4677
02:07:58,541 --> 02:07:59,231
you just have to do.

4678
02:07:59,231 --> 02:08:01,530
Those 15 guys are also
accountable to the Chubb.

4679
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:03,490
Exactly where if you just try it yourself,

4680
02:08:03,491 --> 02:08:04,271
it's going to be tough,

4681
02:08:04,271 --> 02:08:04,511
man.

4682
02:08:04,511 --> 02:08:04,931
It's tough,

4683
02:08:04,931 --> 02:08:07,450
but tough community and information,

4684
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:09,010
those two things are gigantic.

4685
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:10,360
Community is big.

4686
02:08:10,590 --> 02:08:13,630
It's the information and education.

4687
02:08:13,631 --> 02:08:14,760
There's a difference they'll have that.

4688
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:15,610
Friends are telling me,

4689
02:08:15,810 --> 02:08:18,790
I have that friend pulled on and
some of them are fucking awesome.

4690
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:19,750
You know this.

4691
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:22,300
If they didn't want,

4692
02:08:22,301 --> 02:08:25,210
if they wanted to change and they were
bitching about it and they didn't do

4693
02:08:25,211 --> 02:08:25,841
anything about it,

4694
02:08:25,841 --> 02:08:26,710
then it'd be a problem.

4695
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:30,580
But some people were functional as fat
peep and also happy and I celebrate it.

4696
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:31,473
I like that,

4697
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:32,140
you know,

4698
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:32,351
look,

4699
02:08:32,351 --> 02:08:32,561
look,

4700
02:08:32,561 --> 02:08:34,360
some people are fat and they don't drink,

4701
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:36,130
they don't smoke and
they don't eat bad food.

4702
02:08:36,131 --> 02:08:38,740
They just eat too much or they eat a
lot of pizza or something like that.

4703
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:43,000
And then there's some people that are
fat and whine and complain and they're

4704
02:08:43,001 --> 02:08:43,834
always depressed.

4705
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:45,910
That's a problem.

4706
02:08:45,910 --> 02:08:46,743
And they're not happy,

4707
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:47,583
good at anything.

4708
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:48,031
You know,

4709
02:08:48,031 --> 02:08:48,680
this is the other thing,

4710
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:50,500
like got to be fucking good at something,

4711
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:50,951
you know,

4712
02:08:50,951 --> 02:08:52,690
have something that you have joy in.

4713
02:08:52,690 --> 02:08:56,380
Whether it's a game that you like to
play or whether it's a hobby that you

4714
02:08:56,381 --> 02:08:56,920
pursue.

4715
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:59,740
I would say a big country
has the good kind of fat.

4716
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:02,440
He could give a fuck
and he'll knock you out.

4717
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:06,610
But here's the thing with big country
have been a world class fighter at 185

4718
02:09:06,611 --> 02:09:07,444
pounds.

4719
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:08,260
He wasn't,

4720
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:09,093
he wasn't heavy way.

4721
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:10,310
Weird example but,

4722
02:09:10,311 --> 02:09:10,810
but yeah,

4723
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:11,291
but yeah,

4724
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:12,460
but think about that thing.

4725
02:09:12,470 --> 02:09:15,340
A big country if you like
went on a crazy good diet.

4726
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:18,280
I Dunno because it goes
back to fun animal.

4727
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:21,460
It goes back to also the idea
that button Matt harness,

4728
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:23,800
part of like his ability to fight,

4729
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:25,060
stay calm,

4730
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:25,630
you know,

4731
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:28,990
perform under pressure might be
the fact that he could give a fuck.

4732
02:09:29,290 --> 02:09:29,560
Like,

4733
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:32,560
like if you get too
controlling about your weight,

4734
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:36,970
you might get too controlling and Matt
might be a mindset that you can't divest

4735
02:09:36,971 --> 02:09:38,470
from in everything else.

4736
02:09:38,620 --> 02:09:41,650
If you get to calculated with everything
you're doing and you step in that

4737
02:09:41,651 --> 02:09:42,281
octagon,

4738
02:09:42,281 --> 02:09:43,330
something goes wrong.

4739
02:09:43,630 --> 02:09:48,630
You're not as loose maybe or your mind
or your professional or your profession

4740
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:51,190
or your fucking George Saint.

4741
02:09:51,191 --> 02:09:51,790
Pierre,

4742
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:52,623
you know what I mean?

4743
02:09:52,630 --> 02:09:55,000
It's who's a control that certain certain,

4744
02:09:55,001 --> 02:09:58,570
a lot of champions are control
freaks to the nth degree.

4745
02:09:58,630 --> 02:09:59,500
Lance Armstrong.

4746
02:09:59,501 --> 02:09:59,950
Yeah.

4747
02:09:59,950 --> 02:10:02,530
I mean he had that shit down to a science.

4748
02:10:02,531 --> 02:10:04,990
You read about it and
greatest of all time.

4749
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:05,980
So yeah,

4750
02:10:05,981 --> 02:10:06,521
it's a,

4751
02:10:06,521 --> 02:10:08,140
it's a weird conversation,

4752
02:10:08,141 --> 02:10:08,470
right?

4753
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:11,020
It's like where do you draw the line?

4754
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:13,480
Like and what is more important?

4755
02:10:13,481 --> 02:10:15,250
Performance or happiness.

4756
02:10:15,550 --> 02:10:16,270
Right.

4757
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:16,661
That's a,

4758
02:10:16,661 --> 02:10:20,770
that's another thing because sometimes
your performance in order to reach the

4759
02:10:20,771 --> 02:10:22,480
real peak levels of performance,

4760
02:10:22,481 --> 02:10:24,670
especially to maintain
it like as a champion,

4761
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:26,980
you're not necessarily going to be happy.

4762
02:10:26,981 --> 02:10:27,340
No.

4763
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:27,910
No.

4764
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:29,860
You might be happy and
brief moments after you,

4765
02:10:29,861 --> 02:10:31,300
when would that be in everything though.

4766
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:31,990
Not just,

4767
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:34,580
just not with whether it all sports,

4768
02:10:34,581 --> 02:10:35,540
but even entertainment.

4769
02:10:35,541 --> 02:10:36,800
Like if you want to be the top,

4770
02:10:36,801 --> 02:10:37,910
top comedian,

4771
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:39,710
you're not going to suffer.

4772
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:40,250
You're going to have,

4773
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:42,080
you're going to have to
be selfish and you know,

4774
02:10:42,081 --> 02:10:43,640
we do not spend as much
time with your family.

4775
02:10:43,641 --> 02:10:44,540
You're on the road,

4776
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:44,901
you know,

4777
02:10:44,901 --> 02:10:45,051
you're,

4778
02:10:45,051 --> 02:10:45,920
you're doing this,

4779
02:10:45,921 --> 02:10:46,380
you know?

4780
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:46,660
Yeah.

4781
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:50,090
I think it's with anything there's going
to come where if you want to be the tip

4782
02:10:50,091 --> 02:10:51,360
of the spear there,

4783
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,030
there's going to be
some selfishness there.

4784
02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:57,800
And here's the other ironic thing that
if you do spend too much time away from

4785
02:10:57,801 --> 02:10:58,251
friends,

4786
02:10:58,251 --> 02:11:02,900
away from family and you won't be as
good because you won't be as compelling.

4787
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:05,180
It's like you have to
find the balancing act.

4788
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:09,080
You have to find a balancing act
where or you won't be like happy.

4789
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:10,190
Like one of the things that I,

4790
02:11:10,191 --> 02:11:14,420
the guy I always bring up is Richard
Jenny who eventually committed suicide and

4791
02:11:14,421 --> 02:11:17,150
I think to this day he's one of
the greatest comics of all time.

4792
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:20,900
The guy was fucking completely
miserable and he had mental issues,

4793
02:11:20,901 --> 02:11:22,550
obviously it mental health issues,

4794
02:11:22,551 --> 02:11:23,990
which led him to commit suicide.

4795
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:25,093
How long ago?

4796
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:27,590
2007 Tude if you never,

4797
02:11:27,660 --> 02:11:28,461
you're a comic.

4798
02:11:28,461 --> 02:11:29,310
You're trying to do stand up.

4799
02:11:29,650 --> 02:11:30,950
She got to watch Richard Jeni,

4800
02:11:31,310 --> 02:11:31,820
listen,

4801
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:33,980
listen to a big steaming pile of me.

4802
02:11:33,981 --> 02:11:34,910
I tell everybody to get it.

4803
02:11:34,911 --> 02:11:36,260
It's fucking brilliant.

4804
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:40,220
He is the most underrated of
all time and he was miserable.

4805
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:40,371
Yeah,

4806
02:11:40,371 --> 02:11:44,670
he's my top 20 all time greatest and
he's in there and most people don't know

4807
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:45,620
who George Solar,

4808
02:11:45,621 --> 02:11:46,220
what's going on.

4809
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:46,440
Yeah.

4810
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:46,940
Tortured.

4811
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:47,121
Yeah.

4812
02:11:47,121 --> 02:11:48,680
He did a lot of plastic surgery.

4813
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:52,340
Allegedly had peck implants at a
bunch of shit done to his face.

4814
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:52,700
Yeah.

4815
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:53,533
Yeah.

4816
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:54,411
A lot of shit done.

4817
02:11:54,411 --> 02:11:57,230
He'd want it to be Jim Carrey
want to be some leading man.

4818
02:11:57,470 --> 02:11:59,660
But when a rough July's along the way was,

4819
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:03,500
well this was the thing back in those
days in the eighties and nineties

4820
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:05,540
everybody wanted to be a TV star.

4821
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:07,250
They all wanted to be on home improvement.

4822
02:12:07,251 --> 02:12:08,920
They wanted to have their
own show like Roseanne.

4823
02:12:09,580 --> 02:12:12,350
It didn't work out for everybody and he
was one of the guys that didn't work out

4824
02:12:12,351 --> 02:12:12,571
for it.

4825
02:12:12,571 --> 02:12:16,220
But what he did have that he wasn't
getting recognition for what some of the

4826
02:12:16,221 --> 02:12:19,340
best fucking standup at
his standup is so good.

4827
02:12:19,660 --> 02:12:20,870
I wasn't enough for him.

4828
02:12:20,890 --> 02:12:21,740
It wasn't enough for him.

4829
02:12:21,890 --> 02:12:22,640
And why?

4830
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:23,001
I don't know.

4831
02:12:23,001 --> 02:12:23,840
I mean dude,

4832
02:12:23,870 --> 02:12:24,860
a lot of comics,

4833
02:12:24,890 --> 02:12:25,910
especially back then,

4834
02:12:25,911 --> 02:12:26,840
it's different now.

4835
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:28,550
It's different now than it was back then.

4836
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:31,760
But the community of comics is so like,

4837
02:12:31,761 --> 02:12:32,594
uh,

4838
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:35,960
it's so tight and so welcoming now.

4839
02:12:36,170 --> 02:12:38,210
Like we're all used to be.

4840
02:12:38,260 --> 02:12:39,200
It used to be way different,

4841
02:12:39,201 --> 02:12:39,641
right?

4842
02:12:39,641 --> 02:12:40,010
Yeah.

4843
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:41,090
Something happened.

4844
02:12:41,091 --> 02:12:42,200
Not a warm,

4845
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:43,730
not a warm group.

4846
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:44,870
Not just that.

4847
02:12:44,871 --> 02:12:47,630
Like everybody was like
all for themselves.

4848
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:48,531
You know,

4849
02:12:48,531 --> 02:12:51,050
like if you went to see a guy on the road,

4850
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:55,250
they usually took some guy with them that
sucked and that guy would do like 1520

4851
02:12:55,251 --> 02:12:57,830
minutes of Shitty standup and then this
person would go out there and look like

4852
02:12:57,831 --> 02:12:58,580
a God.

4853
02:12:58,580 --> 02:13:01,040
And that was the standard
move that everybody did.

4854
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:02,920
Like George Carlin for the longest time,

4855
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:05,660
took this guy on the road with them
that didn't work any other places.

4856
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:07,040
And there's a lot of those guys,

4857
02:13:07,041 --> 02:13:07,251
they'll,

4858
02:13:07,251 --> 02:13:10,130
they'll take a guy that works
on the road only with them.

4859
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:13,970
They literally don't even
work as a professional outside
of opening it for that.

4860
02:13:14,630 --> 02:13:17,110
And they'll do this shitty act
and then this guy comes on,

4861
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:18,460
it looks like it's just
to make him look good,

4862
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:19,340
just to make them look good.

4863
02:13:19,341 --> 02:13:22,040
And that was what the standard move was.

4864
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:25,340
And then something happened
and I don't know what it is.

4865
02:13:25,370 --> 02:13:26,870
I think there's a bunch of factors,

4866
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:30,440
but I think one of the
factors that happened was that
there was more opportunity

4867
02:13:30,441 --> 02:13:30,861
available,

4868
02:13:30,861 --> 02:13:32,430
so wasn't this feeling of scarcity

4869
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:35,310
because before when it was just
everybody trying to get a network show,

4870
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:36,273
everybody was like,

4871
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:37,291
hey man,

4872
02:13:37,291 --> 02:13:39,510
you might be trying for the
same part I'm trying for.

4873
02:13:39,511 --> 02:13:39,711
I'm a,

4874
02:13:39,711 --> 02:13:40,890
I want to be the host of the tonight show.

4875
02:13:40,891 --> 02:13:42,010
You want to be the host of night show,

4876
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:42,870
fuck you.

4877
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:44,400
It's all every man for himself.

4878
02:13:44,990 --> 02:13:46,770
Your slots are ways to make a living.

4879
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:51,810
Then in the two thousands it opened up
and the internet sort of opened up all

4880
02:13:51,811 --> 02:13:54,590
these different possibilities
and then guys like us realized,

4881
02:13:54,591 --> 02:13:55,424
Hey,

4882
02:13:55,680 --> 02:14:00,030
I don't really get represented correctly
in anything that I do that other people

4883
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:00,510
write.

4884
02:14:00,510 --> 02:14:04,300
What I need to do is figure out how to
just be myself like like people able to

4885
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:07,950
have this distorted idea of who you are
because you hosted fear factor or you

4886
02:14:08,190 --> 02:14:10,860
were on mad TV is pool boy
or whatever the fuck it is.

4887
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:11,100
Like,

4888
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:13,350
this is how they view you and you hold on,

4889
02:14:13,351 --> 02:14:14,460
why did that?

4890
02:14:14,461 --> 02:14:17,010
But I also do this and
I'm also this person.

4891
02:14:17,011 --> 02:14:19,710
And back then you couldn't do that.

4892
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:22,680
It didn't exist before
there was the internet.

4893
02:14:22,681 --> 02:14:25,320
And before you could actually express
yourself completely uncensored.

4894
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:30,450
So I think that that led people to
be like much more scarcity minded,

4895
02:14:30,451 --> 02:14:31,920
much more famine thinking,

4896
02:14:32,270 --> 02:14:32,520
you know,

4897
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:35,190
and famine thinking is the
fucking enemy of community.

4898
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:36,960
As soon as you have famine thinking,

4899
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:38,280
especially being created by you,

4900
02:14:38,281 --> 02:14:39,990
say that because that is his amazing book.

4901
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:40,801
I just finished.

4902
02:14:40,801 --> 02:14:42,090
You should have this guy on your podcast,

4903
02:14:42,091 --> 02:14:42,924
Dan Coyle.

4904
02:14:42,990 --> 02:14:43,950
Did you send me that as a dam?

4905
02:14:43,970 --> 02:14:44,370
You sent me?

4906
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:45,380
It's called the culture code.

4907
02:14:45,381 --> 02:14:46,380
He wrote the talent code too.

4908
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:48,270
He's tended highly successful groups.

4909
02:14:48,271 --> 02:14:49,450
Seal team six of this,

4910
02:14:49,580 --> 02:14:51,150
the seal team,

4911
02:14:51,151 --> 02:14:51,530
six,

4912
02:14:51,530 --> 02:14:52,010
uh,

4913
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:52,590
uh,

4914
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:53,100
fucking,

4915
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:53,410
uh,

4916
02:14:53,410 --> 02:14:54,720
even jewelry thieves.

4917
02:14:54,750 --> 02:14:57,030
So they were like these
amazing jewel thieves.

4918
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:00,300
They studied them and they were
these guys and they would come in,

4919
02:15:00,330 --> 02:15:03,510
they stole from a t in the
middle of the day in Tokyo,

4920
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:06,720
$105 million worth of diamonds.

4921
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:08,670
I think they went to Monaco.

4922
02:15:08,730 --> 02:15:09,421
Same thing,

4923
02:15:09,421 --> 02:15:14,170
stole like $50 million worth of bedrooms
and stuff and got away and speedboats

4924
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:14,700
right.

4925
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:18,420
I mean these guys would
come in for 40 45 seconds,

4926
02:15:18,421 --> 02:15:20,700
come in the bash when and they were like,

4927
02:15:20,701 --> 02:15:21,361
holy fuck.

4928
02:15:21,361 --> 02:15:22,260
They couldn't figure it out.

4929
02:15:22,261 --> 02:15:22,920
They're like,

4930
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:23,460
oh yeah.

4931
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:28,140
I mean they were daring and they would
treat the people in the stores roughly,

4932
02:15:28,141 --> 02:15:28,891
but they didn't kill anybody,

4933
02:15:28,891 --> 02:15:29,550
but they,

4934
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:30,990
and they were strong.

4935
02:15:30,991 --> 02:15:32,880
They looked athletic and they were like,

4936
02:15:32,881 --> 02:15:33,091
all right,

4937
02:15:33,091 --> 02:15:37,590
this is obviously obviously
probably our cons.

4938
02:15:37,591 --> 02:15:39,300
Tigers from the Serbian war.

4939
02:15:39,301 --> 02:15:43,230
They're clearly Serbian
krauts special forces guys,

4940
02:15:43,231 --> 02:15:43,740
right?

4941
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:44,131
They just,

4942
02:15:44,131 --> 02:15:45,480
they were just to organize.

4943
02:15:45,481 --> 02:15:46,314
They were like,

4944
02:15:46,710 --> 02:15:47,550
like literally,

4945
02:15:47,551 --> 02:15:48,990
they wa they move like water.

4946
02:15:49,110 --> 02:15:49,560
They do.

4947
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:51,030
They would dress up as women.

4948
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:53,060
They'd say they come in
like these beautiful women.

4949
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:54,120
Turns out there are men,

4950
02:15:54,121 --> 02:15:55,560
but they look like women.

4951
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:56,060
They're like,

4952
02:15:56,060 --> 02:15:57,580
there's no biological difference.

4953
02:15:58,750 --> 02:15:59,820
And it come in and they just,

4954
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:01,050
but they get away with,

4955
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:01,861
let me say it again,

4956
02:16:01,861 --> 02:16:05,100
$105 million in diamonds at a time.

4957
02:16:05,101 --> 02:16:05,934
Crazy shit.

4958
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,380
The most successful of all time.

4959
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:10,380
So they're trying to think the,

4960
02:16:10,430 --> 02:16:13,740
that they have to constantly stymied
by this idea of what the food,

4961
02:16:13,741 --> 02:16:14,551
the fuck with these guys.

4962
02:16:14,551 --> 02:16:15,384
They've got to be these,

4963
02:16:15,450 --> 02:16:16,860
they've got to be a military unit.

4964
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:18,180
Turns out,

4965
02:16:18,180 --> 02:16:18,691
Nah,

4966
02:16:18,691 --> 02:16:19,620
they sure weren't.

4967
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:24,480
They were middleclass Serbian
kids who'd grown up together.

4968
02:16:24,481 --> 02:16:25,740
They were all friends.

4969
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:26,701
Some were,

4970
02:16:26,701 --> 02:16:27,810
one guy was a,

4971
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:29,220
he studied to be a lawyer.

4972
02:16:29,240 --> 02:16:30,010
Another one said it'd

4973
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:30,660
be a journalist,

4974
02:16:30,660 --> 02:16:31,493
another one.

4975
02:16:31,570 --> 02:16:32,920
These are men and women by the way.

4976
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:33,980
Another one,

4977
02:16:33,980 --> 02:16:34,210
uh,

4978
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:35,043
studied,

4979
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:36,040
played basketball,

4980
02:16:36,041 --> 02:16:37,350
kind of like first second.

4981
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:38,950
I almost made it pro but didn't,

4982
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:40,480
nothing that remarkable.

4983
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:41,440
Middleclass kids,

4984
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:43,330
they all,

4985
02:16:43,510 --> 02:16:44,343
however,

4986
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:44,810
uh,

4987
02:16:44,810 --> 02:16:45,643
and there was no leader,

4988
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:46,570
there was no mastermind.

4989
02:16:46,571 --> 02:16:47,660
They thought there's gotta be a master.

4990
02:16:47,661 --> 02:16:48,910
And I got to find the mastermind.

4991
02:16:48,911 --> 02:16:49,121
Odd.

4992
02:16:49,121 --> 02:16:51,490
There's always a mastermind that
they bring the Jews back to.

4993
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:52,150
No,

4994
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:52,983
not that either.

4995
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:57,970
They were just a loose confederation
of friends from three different towns.

4996
02:16:57,971 --> 02:16:59,860
I think he would have known
each other since childhood.

4997
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:00,911
And they had,

4998
02:17:00,911 --> 02:17:01,930
they grown up in the war.

4999
02:17:02,410 --> 02:17:03,050
So they,

5000
02:17:03,050 --> 02:17:08,050
they had a taste for action
and adventure and they,

5001
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:12,430
but they were all close and they would
get together and they would plan these,

5002
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:13,990
they would plan out these whole,

5003
02:17:14,020 --> 02:17:14,760
you know,

5004
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:15,220
uh,

5005
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:17,410
heists and the way they would do it,

5006
02:17:17,890 --> 02:17:19,900
the way they would do it would was,

5007
02:17:19,901 --> 02:17:22,090
it was fascinating
because there was no boss.

5008
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:26,620
They would just spitball
ideas and everybody was safe,

5009
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:28,360
not only to come up with a good idea,

5010
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:30,400
but everybody was also
safe to sort of like,

5011
02:17:30,401 --> 02:17:31,180
um,

5012
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:31,481
to,

5013
02:17:31,481 --> 02:17:32,440
to be wrong.

5014
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:33,710
So,

5015
02:17:33,710 --> 02:17:34,160
so they,

5016
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:34,420
they,

5017
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:34,680
he,

5018
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:39,580
he went and found the one guy that every
seal team six seal team six is fucking,

5019
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:40,960
who's the one guy?

5020
02:17:40,961 --> 02:17:41,560
He said,

5021
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:44,440
I want the one guy that's the
baddest of the fucking bad.

5022
02:17:44,650 --> 02:17:46,360
I want the guy cause they are,

5023
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:48,370
they are such an effective group.

5024
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:49,773
And um,

5025
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:51,910
and you and I are friends
with Andy stone and you know,

5026
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:52,110
they,

5027
02:17:52,110 --> 02:17:55,840
we know some guys and
everyone was like Dave Cooper.

5028
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:57,190
Dave Cooper is the dude.

5029
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:59,010
He's looking at Hixon Gracie of navy seal.

5030
02:17:59,011 --> 02:18:01,240
He's the guy and Oh fuck,

5031
02:18:01,241 --> 02:18:02,620
I'm going to find this bad ass,

5032
02:18:02,621 --> 02:18:03,610
this who's this?

5033
02:18:03,730 --> 02:18:05,980
Frances and Gatto Geno type,

5034
02:18:05,981 --> 02:18:06,430
you know,

5035
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:07,090
right?

5036
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:07,923
Shows up.

5037
02:18:07,930 --> 02:18:08,561
Guess what?

5038
02:18:08,561 --> 02:18:09,970
He's a regular white dude.

5039
02:18:09,970 --> 02:18:10,803
Just irregular,

5040
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:11,710
very fit.

5041
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:12,910
But he's a regular dude.

5042
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:15,640
Prep up Dave Cooper for a
secondary lever and Dave,

5043
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:17,050
Dave is the kind of guy who would be like,

5044
02:18:17,051 --> 02:18:17,650
um,

5045
02:18:17,650 --> 02:18:18,101
he's like,

5046
02:18:18,101 --> 02:18:18,250
uh,

5047
02:18:18,250 --> 02:18:19,061
what do I call you?

5048
02:18:19,061 --> 02:18:19,630
He was like,

5049
02:18:19,630 --> 02:18:22,590
he's like 20 year like seal
team six Dev grew commandos.

5050
02:18:23,150 --> 02:18:23,650
He's like,

5051
02:18:23,650 --> 02:18:24,130
he's like,

5052
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:25,510
you can call me Dave Cooper.

5053
02:18:25,511 --> 02:18:26,081
Fuck face.

5054
02:18:26,081 --> 02:18:26,750
It's up to you.

5055
02:18:26,750 --> 02:18:27,760
Doctor looks regular.

5056
02:18:27,930 --> 02:18:29,470
That guy looks like a fucking eagle.

5057
02:18:29,780 --> 02:18:30,940
He has eyes.

5058
02:18:31,570 --> 02:18:32,390
You're a salmon.

5059
02:18:32,390 --> 02:18:33,880
He's going to swoop
down and scoop you out.

5060
02:18:33,881 --> 02:18:36,010
A little fucking row should
be on that addiction.

5061
02:18:36,011 --> 02:18:41,011
Has American man fucking Dave Cooler
cause a fucking awesome or cool.

5062
02:18:41,230 --> 02:18:43,390
But the way he sold American,

5063
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:43,600
but,

5064
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:46,300
but he was said to these guys and
when they would come up with ideas,

5065
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:47,650
very democratic,

5066
02:18:47,651 --> 02:18:48,700
very like everybody.

5067
02:18:48,701 --> 02:18:49,780
He wants to hear from everybody.

5068
02:18:49,930 --> 02:18:51,130
There's no stupid question.

5069
02:18:51,140 --> 02:18:53,420
Has Ego doesn't get in the one house.

5070
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:56,170
All that matters is I might
be an idiot and wrong.

5071
02:18:56,171 --> 02:18:58,300
All that matters is I want results.

5072
02:18:58,330 --> 02:18:59,080
That's all it is.

5073
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:02,260
And when you study these highly
effective groups and they look like great

5074
02:19:02,261 --> 02:19:03,220
basketball teams,

5075
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:04,241
Popovich,

5076
02:19:04,241 --> 02:19:04,870
you'd love this.

5077
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:05,703
Popovich,

5078
02:19:05,830 --> 02:19:10,000
I didn't know that the at the spurs were
the most winning in the past 20 years.

5079
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:14,020
The most winningest team in the past 20
years when we winning it's American team

5080
02:19:14,021 --> 02:19:16,180
in past 20 years and it's the same way.

5081
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:17,800
His ability to kind of like,

5082
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:18,401
he's,

5083
02:19:18,401 --> 02:19:19,234
I'm fucking,

5084
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:20,130
he's got a foam,

5085
02:19:20,130 --> 02:19:21,880
Duncan volcanic temper,

5086
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:22,961
volcanic tit.

5087
02:19:22,961 --> 02:19:24,160
Does that mean who's Tim Duncan?

5088
02:19:24,310 --> 02:19:25,110
One of the greatest,

5089
02:19:25,110 --> 02:19:25,943
greatest of all time.

5090
02:19:25,990 --> 02:19:27,010
Mr Fundamentals,

5091
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:28,160
but he

5092
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:28,710
hall of fame,

5093
02:19:28,710 --> 02:19:29,061
but he,

5094
02:19:29,061 --> 02:19:31,790
as far as his team is because there's
a lot to do that it's not a lot of

5095
02:19:31,791 --> 02:19:32,480
superstars.

5096
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:34,470
It's also the way they
structured the team.

5097
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:35,060
Brendan,

5098
02:19:35,060 --> 02:19:36,560
like they've done some
studies as far as like,

5099
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:37,700
he has amazing players though.

5100
02:19:37,850 --> 02:19:38,330
No doubt.

5101
02:19:38,330 --> 02:19:38,611
Yeah.

5102
02:19:38,611 --> 02:19:42,620
But he also makes amazing players and how
they work together and in fundamentals

5103
02:19:42,621 --> 02:19:45,200
and how they work together
and how how they communicate,

5104
02:19:45,310 --> 02:19:46,800
and that's really the question too.

5105
02:19:46,801 --> 02:19:48,200
Like what makes a great team?

5106
02:19:48,230 --> 02:19:52,850
Is a great team just having killer
individual players or is it having really

5107
02:19:52,851 --> 02:19:56,060
good individual players in a killer and
environment and they all grow and get

5108
02:19:56,061 --> 02:19:56,571
better together?

5109
02:19:56,571 --> 02:19:57,231
They've done studies.

5110
02:19:57,231 --> 02:19:57,441
I'm like,

5111
02:19:57,441 --> 02:20:01,190
you've got to think that a guy who's
in the NFL say for his first year,

5112
02:20:01,191 --> 02:20:02,270
as long as it doesn't get injured,

5113
02:20:02,570 --> 02:20:05,150
if he keeps playing and he keeps
hustling and keeps learning,

5114
02:20:05,151 --> 02:20:06,860
he's going to be better in two years,

5115
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:07,580
right?

5116
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:08,361
If he doesn't get injured,

5117
02:20:08,361 --> 02:20:10,400
NBA is probably better because
you don't get injured as much,

5118
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:13,700
but you got to think that these players
are going to get better at basketball,

5119
02:20:13,701 --> 02:20:16,490
better at competing under pressure
and get better at playing together.

5120
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:17,631
They're all going to get better.

5121
02:20:17,631 --> 02:20:21,110
These guys were talking about
this before in the world.

5122
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:21,331
The,

5123
02:20:21,331 --> 02:20:21,561
the,

5124
02:20:21,561 --> 02:20:22,970
the Golden State Warriors,

5125
02:20:23,270 --> 02:20:23,751
you know the,

5126
02:20:23,751 --> 02:20:24,920
they call him a super team,

5127
02:20:24,921 --> 02:20:26,240
but they were drafted.

5128
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:27,980
They added Kevin Durant,

5129
02:20:27,981 --> 02:20:29,030
which makes them even better.

5130
02:20:29,031 --> 02:20:30,120
Who's one of the best
players in the league?

5131
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:30,950
Top three.

5132
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:31,990
But before that they had,

5133
02:20:32,010 --> 02:20:32,930
they were all drafted,

5134
02:20:32,931 --> 02:20:33,800
came up together.

5135
02:20:33,801 --> 02:20:35,090
So they play as a team.

5136
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:36,320
Right now they're on unstoppable.

5137
02:20:36,490 --> 02:20:36,820
Yeah,

5138
02:20:36,820 --> 02:20:41,820
so like a Cleveland or Miami put
all these superstars together,

5139
02:20:41,991 --> 02:20:43,940
Houston or Okc,

5140
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:46,940
the Golden State Warriors were
draft and they came up as a team.

5141
02:20:46,941 --> 02:20:47,780
Now they're super cute.

5142
02:20:47,781 --> 02:20:48,800
Even like teams,

5143
02:20:48,801 --> 02:20:50,270
I don't know a whole lot about teams,

5144
02:20:50,271 --> 02:20:53,480
but teams that grow up
to that get put together.

5145
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:55,910
They depend upon some sense of community.

5146
02:20:55,911 --> 02:20:56,390
Yes.

5147
02:20:56,390 --> 02:20:57,590
When that community falls apart,

5148
02:20:57,591 --> 02:21:01,000
like remember when Shaq and Kobe
beef and it was a real problem,

5149
02:21:01,001 --> 02:21:04,790
the real problem because they were playing
on the same team and Shaq was doing

5150
02:21:04,791 --> 02:21:06,080
raps about Colby.

5151
02:21:06,081 --> 02:21:09,250
It was a fucking real problem that kills
things because killed things mean it's

5152
02:21:09,251 --> 02:21:13,220
somebody has dominion just on
who they are over the group.

5153
02:21:13,460 --> 02:21:16,070
That becomes a problem because
everybody has to share ideas.

5154
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:16,701
This,

5155
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:17,790
the structural engineer,

5156
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:18,770
you heard me talking about this,

5157
02:21:18,771 --> 02:21:20,750
a structural engineer and this architect,

5158
02:21:20,751 --> 02:21:23,600
he did this amazing
study where he took CEOs,

5159
02:21:23,810 --> 02:21:24,643
lawyers,

5160
02:21:25,070 --> 02:21:25,430
uh,

5161
02:21:25,430 --> 02:21:28,070
business students and kindergarteners,

5162
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:29,030
and he said,

5163
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:29,510
okay,

5164
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:30,080
here's the,

5165
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:30,681
here's the,

5166
02:21:30,681 --> 02:21:31,040
uh,

5167
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:31,910
here's the task.

5168
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:34,820
26 pieces of uncooked spaghetti,

5169
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:36,710
a yard of tape,

5170
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:38,480
a yard of string,

5171
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:40,940
and a marshmallow might be one last thing.

5172
02:21:40,941 --> 02:21:41,774
I can't remember.

5173
02:21:42,380 --> 02:21:45,740
Whoever makes the tallest
structure is the one that wins.

5174
02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:47,390
Ceos,

5175
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:48,643
lawyers.

5176
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:53,590
The kindergarten kindergarteners figured
it out because the way they approached

5177
02:21:53,591 --> 02:21:54,410
the problem,

5178
02:21:54,410 --> 02:21:57,590
nobody had invisible ideas of authority.

5179
02:21:57,620 --> 02:21:58,790
Nobody had sort of this kind of,

5180
02:21:58,791 --> 02:21:59,421
I know more than me.

5181
02:21:59,421 --> 02:22:00,410
I'm not going to say my thing.

5182
02:22:00,590 --> 02:22:01,423
They were like,

5183
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:02,061
and now,

5184
02:22:02,061 --> 02:22:02,790
yes,

5185
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:03,180
there,

5186
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:03,800
there's no,

5187
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,500
we're all fucking idea.

5188
02:22:05,650 --> 02:22:06,081
And there were no,

5189
02:22:06,081 --> 02:22:06,621
let me do this.

5190
02:22:06,621 --> 02:22:08,030
And they would just fight over the idea,

5191
02:22:08,031 --> 02:22:09,070
but it was the best guy.

5192
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:10,160
He's listening to the kindergarten.

5193
02:22:10,161 --> 02:22:11,210
The best idea would win.

5194
02:22:11,350 --> 02:22:11,631
Be like,

5195
02:22:11,631 --> 02:22:12,201
shut up kid.

5196
02:22:12,201 --> 02:22:13,034
You're fine.

5197
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:13,460
No,

5198
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:14,300
they were all together.

5199
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:15,260
It was groups of four.

5200
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:16,480
So there are four kindergartners,

5201
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:17,220
but the kindergartens,

5202
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:18,230
the four of them figured it out.

5203
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:18,451
Yeah.

5204
02:22:18,451 --> 02:22:22,310
They built a 26 in structure and
the second one was the CEO's.

5205
02:22:22,311 --> 02:22:25,860
They built a 22 inch ratios are thinking
about cocaine and Pussy Bromley,

5206
02:22:25,950 --> 02:22:27,090
how their stocks are doing.

5207
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:29,700
There's too distracted and give a fuck.

5208
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:32,430
It's the question of like what
makes children learn better?

5209
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:32,911
You know,

5210
02:22:32,911 --> 02:22:33,744
I uh,

5211
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:36,000
I watched kids,

5212
02:22:36,001 --> 02:22:38,700
obviously I have them and I
watched them learn things.

5213
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:43,110
And it's interesting how some kids learn
things really quickly and some things

5214
02:22:43,111 --> 02:22:44,550
don't or some kids don't.

5215
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:48,540
And how parents just really don't have
the ability to learn at the same level

5216
02:22:48,541 --> 02:22:48,961
the kids do.

5217
02:22:48,961 --> 02:22:49,291
And so I'm like,

5218
02:22:49,291 --> 02:22:49,411
well,

5219
02:22:49,411 --> 02:22:50,220
what is it?

5220
02:22:50,220 --> 02:22:51,660
Is it a physical limitation?

5221
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:54,060
Is it a clarity thing?

5222
02:22:54,061 --> 02:22:55,500
Is it an ego thing?

5223
02:22:55,730 --> 02:22:57,630
Is it your identity that holds you back?

5224
02:22:57,930 --> 02:23:01,470
I think it's the amount of time and
energy that you put towards something and

5225
02:23:01,471 --> 02:23:03,300
whether or not you're
willing to be obsessed by it.

5226
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:04,613
Yes.

5227
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:09,480
And I think that some parents and some
people that are adults just do not have

5228
02:23:09,481 --> 02:23:12,990
the same kind of time that a nine year
old has to think about things all day.

5229
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:14,730
They don't have the same
amount of things in their head.

5230
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:16,020
They don't have the same,

5231
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:19,890
they have too many bills and stresses
and distractions and things pulling them

5232
02:23:19,891 --> 02:23:23,970
away and different angles and they
don't have this sense of who they are.

5233
02:23:23,971 --> 02:23:24,460
The way of,

5234
02:23:24,460 --> 02:23:24,690
uh,

5235
02:23:24,690 --> 02:23:28,230
an adult does that sense of who
you are can be very limiting.

5236
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:31,170
You can have this decision
that you have in your head.

5237
02:23:31,670 --> 02:23:32,320
That's what,

5238
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:32,941
that's what it is.

5239
02:23:32,941 --> 02:23:33,150
Yeah.

5240
02:23:33,150 --> 02:23:33,871
That's a big part of it.

5241
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:35,640
They've done a study on that.

5242
02:23:35,641 --> 02:23:39,150
Like there's a huge body of study on how,

5243
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:42,710
what conditions are the
most effective to learn it.

5244
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:47,760
I mean they've done a lot of work on this
and one of the main things that lends

5245
02:23:47,761 --> 02:23:52,160
itself to learning fast and well
is just the idea that you're,

5246
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:54,150
you're psychologically safe.

5247
02:23:54,151 --> 02:23:54,930
The idea that,

5248
02:23:54,930 --> 02:23:55,763
first of all,

5249
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:57,960
there's no shame in making mistakes.

5250
02:23:57,980 --> 02:23:58,111
Right?

5251
02:23:58,111 --> 02:23:59,010
That's huge.

5252
02:23:59,011 --> 02:24:00,000
Can Be afraid to fail.

5253
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:00,480
Yeah,

5254
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:00,781
man.

5255
02:24:00,781 --> 02:24:01,650
And you will fail.

5256
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:03,930
But it has to be competition to look.

5257
02:24:03,931 --> 02:24:04,471
It has to be,

5258
02:24:04,471 --> 02:24:06,390
it has to feel like shit when you do fail.

5259
02:24:06,510 --> 02:24:08,040
Cause if it doesn't feel
like shit when you fail,

5260
02:24:08,041 --> 02:24:08,670
like there's,

5261
02:24:08,670 --> 02:24:11,250
there's always the thing on
AgLearn you learn when you win,

5262
02:24:11,251 --> 02:24:12,660
but you learn more when you lose,

5263
02:24:13,170 --> 02:24:16,800
you learn a lot more than I think failing
and feeling like shit is important to

5264
02:24:16,801 --> 02:24:17,970
re re-energize,

5265
02:24:17,971 --> 02:24:21,960
remotivate refocus and then to
recognize this is a bad feeling.

5266
02:24:21,961 --> 02:24:23,070
I don't like this feeling.

5267
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:24,030
I have to work harder,

5268
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:25,920
truly repercussions to,

5269
02:24:25,921 --> 02:24:27,960
you know that's true.

5270
02:24:27,961 --> 02:24:28,681
But you need somebody,

5271
02:24:28,681 --> 02:24:29,670
if you're a young person,

5272
02:24:29,671 --> 02:24:33,060
you need somebody to help you navigate
out of that space because don't,

5273
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:33,690
and you're,

5274
02:24:33,690 --> 02:24:35,180
you feel like shit and then your shame,

5275
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:35,910
you're told,

5276
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:36,421
you're told,

5277
02:24:36,421 --> 02:24:38,100
usually you're just not as good.

5278
02:24:38,130 --> 02:24:38,401
Right?

5279
02:24:38,401 --> 02:24:38,670
And it's,

5280
02:24:38,670 --> 02:24:40,050
and you're not going to
be able to get as good.

5281
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:41,370
What happens is people quit.

5282
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:43,050
Some people though,

5283
02:24:43,410 --> 02:24:44,221
some people,

5284
02:24:44,221 --> 02:24:45,300
some people don't,

5285
02:24:45,301 --> 02:24:48,540
and they dig their heels in and they
get stronger demands on the customer.

5286
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:49,440
Depends on the person.

5287
02:24:49,441 --> 02:24:51,540
So you need somebody to help you realize,

5288
02:24:51,630 --> 02:24:52,020
hey,

5289
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:52,740
hold on.

5290
02:24:52,740 --> 02:24:54,480
Learning is a bitch.

5291
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:56,070
Learning as a motherfucker,

5292
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:57,113
don't worry.

5293
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:58,860
This is part of the process.

5294
02:24:58,861 --> 02:25:00,630
So let me help you navigate your way out.

5295
02:25:00,750 --> 02:25:04,950
So the biggest thing that they always
do is make you realize that mistakes are

5296
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:06,750
necessary,

5297
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:09,750
important and just as good at this stage,

5298
02:25:09,751 --> 02:25:10,680
they feel like shit.

5299
02:25:10,681 --> 02:25:11,514
Of course they do.

5300
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:13,290
They come with all
kinds of weird feelings.

5301
02:25:13,710 --> 02:25:15,780
Let's stay in this stand,

5302
02:25:15,810 --> 02:25:16,200
this,

5303
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:16,801
learn how to stay.

5304
02:25:16,801 --> 02:25:19,950
I'm comfortable in this and let's figure
out a way to get the fuck out of this

5305
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:21,450
because the real killers,

5306
02:25:21,460 --> 02:25:22,291
the real winners,

5307
02:25:22,291 --> 02:25:24,730
they're going to be killers in
winners in any sort of scenario,

5308
02:25:24,731 --> 02:25:27,940
but you can develop more winners
if you have a better structure,

5309
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:29,680
a better learning environment,

5310
02:25:29,710 --> 02:25:29,921
you'll,

5311
02:25:29,921 --> 02:25:30,321
you'll have,

5312
02:25:30,321 --> 02:25:32,470
and then also the
community will be better.

5313
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:33,110
Yes,

5314
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:34,540
it says we keep coming back to that,

5315
02:25:34,541 --> 02:25:38,170
but I think this is God damn gigantic and
we're not just talking about community

5316
02:25:38,171 --> 02:25:41,530
in the sense of people that know each
other like in an one on one individual

5317
02:25:41,531 --> 02:25:42,220
basis.

5318
02:25:42,220 --> 02:25:42,401
Well,

5319
02:25:42,401 --> 02:25:44,950
you guys have done with your
podcast is creative community.

5320
02:25:44,951 --> 02:25:46,900
I see the community
interacting with itself.

5321
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:49,090
I see you guys interacting with your fans,

5322
02:25:49,091 --> 02:25:49,361
like you've,

5323
02:25:49,361 --> 02:25:51,400
you've made a community of fun,

5324
02:25:51,401 --> 02:25:53,710
silly people that get together
when they come to see your shuts.

5325
02:25:53,711 --> 02:25:55,150
Cause he and our silly yeah,

5326
02:25:56,230 --> 02:25:57,063
for sure.

5327
02:25:57,070 --> 02:25:57,880
But this is,

5328
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:59,110
this is also community.

5329
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:01,930
This is even people that don't
physically know each other,

5330
02:26:02,110 --> 02:26:03,790
it becomes a thing,

5331
02:26:04,030 --> 02:26:04,331
you know?

5332
02:26:04,331 --> 02:26:09,040
And I think that that that is
one of the least discussed,

5333
02:26:09,041 --> 02:26:14,041
but most important parts of happiness
and a part of and most important parts of

5334
02:26:14,561 --> 02:26:16,840
developing its community.

5335
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:17,260
Yeah.

5336
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:17,830
Giant.

5337
02:26:17,830 --> 02:26:18,663
Yeah.

5338
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:19,091
Yeah,

5339
02:26:19,091 --> 02:26:19,660
it is.

5340
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:20,770
And also like learning,

5341
02:26:20,890 --> 02:26:25,610
like we had a really good discussion
about the podcast and it was funny how I'm

5342
02:26:25,611 --> 02:26:28,500
going to Piss when a combat taken up.

5343
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:29,591
I fucked up.

5344
02:26:29,591 --> 02:26:30,620
I fucked up today.

5345
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:31,690
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

5346
02:26:31,691 --> 02:26:32,950
I drink so much caffeine.

5347
02:26:32,970 --> 02:26:33,121
You know,

5348
02:26:33,121 --> 02:26:33,851
last time I shit,

5349
02:26:33,851 --> 02:26:36,580
my pants learning is important.

5350
02:26:36,610 --> 02:26:38,650
I just talked about
cyber and and metal deck.

5351
02:26:38,890 --> 02:26:39,723
I like that.

5352
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:41,480
That's the first time outside work.

5353
02:26:41,490 --> 02:26:41,891
Hollywood,

5354
02:26:41,891 --> 02:26:42,750
he'd get back and bribe you.

5355
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:43,360
Take it.

5356
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:45,280
Fucking take your break.

5357
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:46,750
I want to talk about cyber Holly.

5358
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:47,081
Oh,

5359
02:26:47,081 --> 02:26:47,741
what were we talking about?

5360
02:26:47,741 --> 02:26:48,140
We were talking,

5361
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:49,310
we were talking about about how,

5362
02:26:49,311 --> 02:26:49,860
how,

5363
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:50,230
uh,

5364
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:54,250
when we have an issue that we want to
make the podcast better or whatever.

5365
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:54,421
Oh,

5366
02:26:54,421 --> 02:26:57,280
and I called you and said you searched
on the parts thing you do is take care of

5367
02:26:57,410 --> 02:26:57,640
you,

5368
02:26:57,640 --> 02:26:58,360
your,

5369
02:26:58,360 --> 02:26:59,860
you make sure my feelings are you,

5370
02:26:59,861 --> 02:27:01,720
like you take care of my feelings.

5371
02:27:02,170 --> 02:27:03,730
I do the same thing with you like we,

5372
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:06,070
why we want to make sure
that they'll be like,

5373
02:27:06,071 --> 02:27:06,221
hey,

5374
02:27:06,221 --> 02:27:06,881
I don't give a fuck.

5375
02:27:06,881 --> 02:27:07,480
When we just down,

5376
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:08,021
we got some,

5377
02:27:08,021 --> 02:27:10,780
read some research on the
podcasts I called Bryce said,

5378
02:27:10,781 --> 02:27:10,960
hey,

5379
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:12,580
here's where we get the most listeners.

5380
02:27:12,581 --> 02:27:13,720
Here's where people turn it off.

5381
02:27:13,721 --> 02:27:14,590
Here's what we do this.

5382
02:27:14,750 --> 02:27:15,920
And I feel blank.

5383
02:27:16,060 --> 02:27:17,500
I tell Brian this all the time.

5384
02:27:17,501 --> 02:27:18,334
I go,

5385
02:27:18,370 --> 02:27:19,203
listen,

5386
02:27:19,390 --> 02:27:21,010
they might turn off here,

5387
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:24,990
but we didn't create this thing to decide
what people like and what don't like.

5388
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:29,230
If you want to do fucking an
hour of what you want to do,

5389
02:27:29,260 --> 02:27:29,900
we're doing that.

5390
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:30,190
We're,

5391
02:27:30,190 --> 02:27:31,570
we're doing what we want to do.

5392
02:27:31,640 --> 02:27:32,441
If they like it,

5393
02:27:32,441 --> 02:27:32,681
great,

5394
02:27:32,681 --> 02:27:34,140
but that's how this thing got to it.

5395
02:27:34,630 --> 02:27:35,780
So we're going to do
whatever you want to do.

5396
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:37,420
That being said,

5397
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:39,850
he got to quit doing that.

5398
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:40,141
No,

5399
02:27:40,141 --> 02:27:40,960
but that being said,

5400
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:41,741
you've got gotta be responsive.

5401
02:27:41,741 --> 02:27:41,861
No,

5402
02:27:41,861 --> 02:27:42,341
I just told him,

5403
02:27:42,341 --> 02:27:42,551
I said,

5404
02:27:42,551 --> 02:27:43,270
if you want to do it,

5405
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:44,150
do it down.

5406
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:45,850
But here's the feedback.

5407
02:27:45,851 --> 02:27:46,301
We're good.

5408
02:27:46,301 --> 02:27:46,481
Yeah.

5409
02:27:46,481 --> 02:27:47,101
Be Responsible.

5410
02:27:47,101 --> 02:27:48,400
Let's do what you want to do though.

5411
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:49,560
Here's the evidence.

5412
02:27:49,560 --> 02:27:50,080
Yeah.

5413
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:51,810
And so if you're not going
to be responsible either,

5414
02:27:51,890 --> 02:27:52,670
but here's the evidence,

5415
02:27:52,670 --> 02:27:56,270
he'd done it again and just
keep doing your own thing.

5416
02:27:56,470 --> 02:27:56,790
You'll,

5417
02:27:56,790 --> 02:27:57,940
you'll peep when I,

5418
02:27:57,970 --> 02:27:59,170
when a signal at you,

5419
02:27:59,171 --> 02:28:01,840
you'll peep when I
signal at you otherwise.

5420
02:28:01,841 --> 02:28:03,190
But that's why we've,

5421
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:05,600
we've never had that issue rec out.

5422
02:28:05,650 --> 02:28:05,951
We got,

5423
02:28:05,951 --> 02:28:06,890
I have to do this.

5424
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:09,820
I asked you and I thought
that every single time,

5425
02:28:09,850 --> 02:28:10,750
no matter even in fights,

5426
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:11,890
we'll get it fucking tax.

5427
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:12,311
Hey man,

5428
02:28:12,311 --> 02:28:12,701
sorry.

5429
02:28:12,701 --> 02:28:13,780
I'm a little out of line man,

5430
02:28:14,090 --> 02:28:15,760
because all it matters is what works.

5431
02:28:15,761 --> 02:28:17,410
I don't give a fuck about being right.

5432
02:28:18,070 --> 02:28:18,730
I want to learn.

5433
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:19,180
Um,

5434
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:20,530
I'm you sensei though.

5435
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:22,400
We've established that and now the war,

5436
02:28:22,401 --> 02:28:23,180
I'm Rogan put,

5437
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:24,013
but look at me.

5438
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:25,220
Rogan's gun.

5439
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:27,800
Call me road dog or I'm
going to kick you in the,

5440
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:29,060
you're not a fucking road.

5441
02:28:29,061 --> 02:28:29,770
Dot.

5442
02:28:29,770 --> 02:28:30,170
I knew.

5443
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:30,850
Call me,

5444
02:28:30,850 --> 02:28:31,683
call me,

5445
02:28:32,460 --> 02:28:33,360
call me in a puff.

5446
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:34,873
Broke you're nuts.

5447
02:28:35,060 --> 02:28:36,110
I had the fight.

5448
02:28:36,220 --> 02:28:36,900
No fight.

5449
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:37,561
Listen to me right now.

5450
02:28:37,561 --> 02:28:38,360
How many,

5451
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:39,350
I'm not calling you road dog.

5452
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:40,120
Tommy wrote,

5453
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:41,890
he's a road puppy dog.

5454
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:44,540
Yet comfortable that he
sells more tickets in you.

5455
02:28:44,610 --> 02:28:45,620
I was going to get to that.

5456
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:47,181
I was going to get to that.

5457
02:28:47,181 --> 02:28:50,270
Seems weird now that you ruined my
Christmas with that cause he sold out the

5458
02:28:50,271 --> 02:28:51,104
Wilbur.

5459
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:52,333
Wow.

5460
02:28:52,370 --> 02:28:53,450
Why are you laughing right now?

5461
02:28:53,451 --> 02:28:54,160
Sold it out.

5462
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:56,030
Why are you uncomfortable?

5463
02:28:57,520 --> 02:28:58,570
You're not a good friend.

5464
02:28:59,610 --> 02:29:01,670
You've broken a which you put best friend.

5465
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:03,080
You put a wedge between us.

5466
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:04,020
Now the podcast,

5467
02:29:07,530 --> 02:29:08,780
you've ruined a good friend.

5468
02:29:09,270 --> 02:29:10,400
I want you to think about this.

5469
02:29:10,401 --> 02:29:11,234
This is a real issue,

5470
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:13,000
but well this is white.

5471
02:29:13,010 --> 02:29:13,720
Wants to diminish.

5472
02:29:13,720 --> 02:29:14,790
You rode puppy.

5473
02:29:14,810 --> 02:29:15,640
She's like,

5474
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:16,473
yeah bro.

5475
02:29:17,450 --> 02:29:19,040
I went to Dublin,

5476
02:29:19,090 --> 02:29:20,100
shot Australia.

5477
02:29:20,210 --> 02:29:20,780
Amit,

5478
02:29:20,780 --> 02:29:21,613
call me road dog.

5479
02:29:22,470 --> 02:29:23,540
You haven't earned that yet.

5480
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:25,790
Call me wrote and you call me Sensei.

5481
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:27,800
When I give you advice
I don't like when I say,

5482
02:29:27,801 --> 02:29:27,981
Hey,

5483
02:29:27,981 --> 02:29:28,814
try this and you go,

5484
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:30,740
it makes me feel comfortable
with you on a force that on,

5485
02:29:30,741 --> 02:29:31,520
okay.

5486
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,770
Sensei [inaudible] Sensei,

5487
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:36,340
you stayed up fuck Caladis for all.

5488
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:36,831
Oh listen,

5489
02:29:36,831 --> 02:29:38,600
I've been a comedian for almost 30 years.

5490
02:29:38,601 --> 02:29:39,680
I think I'm allowed to talk about that.

5491
02:29:40,110 --> 02:29:40,480
We're having,

5492
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:42,890
and I also am a very good
friend of Brennan shops.

5493
02:29:42,891 --> 02:29:43,221
Correct.

5494
02:29:43,221 --> 02:29:44,540
And I don't feel the need to diminish him.

5495
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:45,171
In fact,

5496
02:29:45,171 --> 02:29:46,550
I pop them up at every stamp,

5497
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:47,450
every chance I can.

5498
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:48,250
My man,

5499
02:29:48,250 --> 02:29:49,083
oh my God,

5500
02:29:49,230 --> 02:29:51,520
they do pump them up.

5501
02:29:53,310 --> 02:29:56,390
Having a conversation on text the other
day where I was telling him how proud I

5502
02:29:56,391 --> 02:29:57,150
was of him,

5503
02:29:57,150 --> 02:29:59,600
how he hustles and then
he's got disciplined.

5504
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:02,280
That's one of the things that
holds a lot of comedians back.

5505
02:30:02,330 --> 02:30:06,230
They don't have the kind of discipline
at this guy is out there doing things a

5506
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:09,320
couple of years into comedy that guys
had been doing comedy for 10 15 years.

5507
02:30:09,321 --> 02:30:09,680
Can't do.

5508
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:10,040
I know.

5509
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:11,600
Well let's just keep
this humorous for a sec.

5510
02:30:11,900 --> 02:30:12,590
I'm trying.

5511
02:30:12,590 --> 02:30:13,423
I'm trying to mess with,

5512
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,470
I'm going to go dark though.

5513
02:30:15,471 --> 02:30:16,330
You called me a road dog.

5514
02:30:16,830 --> 02:30:17,540
I don't,

5515
02:30:17,540 --> 02:30:19,130
I don't want to be called
the road dog either.

5516
02:30:19,310 --> 02:30:21,370
So I don't know if that's a
good thing to want to be called.

5517
02:30:21,371 --> 02:30:22,490
And you want to be called a road.

5518
02:30:22,510 --> 02:30:23,620
Just a fucking comedian.

5519
02:30:23,621 --> 02:30:25,630
Road Wolf have an inner wolf

5520
02:30:28,150 --> 02:30:28,880
had me.

5521
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:29,713
I can't control it.

5522
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:31,520
Sometimes it's a cat.

5523
02:30:31,521 --> 02:30:32,570
It's going to come out.

5524
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:34,420
It's going to come out sometimes.

5525
02:30:34,460 --> 02:30:37,550
Well I didn't call myself wrote anything
but then you until you called me a road

5526
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:38,080
pop.

5527
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,520
Oh he is another one.

5528
02:30:39,530 --> 02:30:40,490
Try to diminish you bro.

5529
02:30:40,570 --> 02:30:43,240
Cause trying to hold it against them but
you could kill him with your hands and

5530
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:44,210
that makes him uncomfortable.

5531
02:30:44,510 --> 02:30:45,620
He's so much funnier though.

5532
02:30:45,621 --> 02:30:46,970
So he wins in for an hour.

5533
02:30:46,971 --> 02:30:48,950
He's funnier for now.

5534
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:52,430
Does it comedy as well as I do.

5535
02:30:52,431 --> 02:30:52,791
Look at it.

5536
02:30:52,791 --> 02:30:53,450
Y'all better.

5537
02:30:53,450 --> 02:30:53,751
I do.

5538
02:30:53,751 --> 02:30:56,870
I do look shop once a day and I do.

5539
02:30:56,900 --> 02:30:57,800
It does cross my mind.

5540
02:30:57,801 --> 02:30:58,910
I'm always like he could,

5541
02:30:59,450 --> 02:31:01,610
he could stifle my life with his hands.

5542
02:31:01,790 --> 02:31:02,061
Yeah,

5543
02:31:02,061 --> 02:31:02,790
but the,

5544
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:04,460
that part is a given.

5545
02:31:04,730 --> 02:31:07,910
But you should be in
admiration of what he's doing,

5546
02:31:07,911 --> 02:31:08,720
but stand up.

5547
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:09,560
He's hustling.

5548
02:31:09,580 --> 02:31:10,110
I'll come on.

5549
02:31:10,110 --> 02:31:11,900
Who is his biggest
supporter will tell you,

5550
02:31:11,901 --> 02:31:12,320
hey,

5551
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:13,153
excuse me.

5552
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:14,990
You're not his biggest
support and might be.

5553
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:15,873
I am,

5554
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:18,920
but I'm 100% mother.

5555
02:31:19,410 --> 02:31:20,070
I'm 100%

5556
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:20,600
positive.

5557
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:21,433
You're not

5558
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:23,790
100% positive.

5559
02:31:23,791 --> 02:31:28,140
You're calling them brode
pop and he's a roadblock.

5560
02:31:31,430 --> 02:31:31,800
This is,

5561
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:32,100
hey,

5562
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:35,020
this is like my mom and dad fight my room.

5563
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:36,780
You're a fucking coward right now.

5564
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:38,731
Let me ask you this.

5565
02:31:38,731 --> 02:31:40,650
Do you ever open up for Brendan anywhere?

5566
02:31:41,450 --> 02:31:41,910
Never.

5567
02:31:41,910 --> 02:31:42,361
I might be.

5568
02:31:42,361 --> 02:31:43,740
I'm opening up for him in the future.

5569
02:31:43,741 --> 02:31:44,610
I've got a Gig.

5570
02:31:44,790 --> 02:31:46,410
He and I are going for me to actually,

5571
02:31:46,470 --> 02:31:48,030
I did open up for you when you did.

5572
02:31:48,031 --> 02:31:49,090
You're a standup special.

5573
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:50,673
It's funny.

5574
02:31:51,130 --> 02:31:53,690
We can get related to open it
up for Brendan on the sneaker.

5575
02:31:53,790 --> 02:31:56,730
We can get one of the biggest
fucking comics to open for us.

5576
02:31:56,731 --> 02:31:57,564
It's pretty cool.

5577
02:31:57,870 --> 02:31:58,710
I'm fortunate,

5578
02:31:58,711 --> 02:31:58,860
man.

5579
02:31:58,860 --> 02:32:00,210
Rogan would actually do that for us.

5580
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:01,010
Yeah.

5581
02:32:01,010 --> 02:32:02,550
I really need my open up for you.

5582
02:32:02,610 --> 02:32:06,210
It was the first time it opened
for anybody in like 29 years.

5583
02:32:06,650 --> 02:32:10,350
It's the first time I ever went on stage
without anybody going on before me.

5584
02:32:10,470 --> 02:32:12,450
I know like you really
like that's a hard gig.

5585
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:14,670
Like the opening spot is
a little more difficult,

5586
02:32:14,671 --> 02:32:16,280
so you gotta like juice the audience up.

5587
02:32:16,290 --> 02:32:17,040
You've got to get them.

5588
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:17,610
It's an art.

5589
02:32:17,610 --> 02:32:20,760
There's an art form to
smoothing them into the show.

5590
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:21,870
I just learned that,

5591
02:32:21,871 --> 02:32:22,950
so I bring someone on the road,

5592
02:32:23,010 --> 02:32:23,611
but she was like,

5593
02:32:23,611 --> 02:32:24,031
hold on,

5594
02:32:24,031 --> 02:32:25,260
you're just going out there cold and like,

5595
02:32:25,261 --> 02:32:25,381
yeah,

5596
02:32:25,381 --> 02:32:26,131
I just do my thing.

5597
02:32:26,131 --> 02:32:26,530
He's like,

5598
02:32:26,530 --> 02:32:27,000
no,

5599
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:27,241
no,

5600
02:32:27,241 --> 02:32:28,074
what the fuck?

5601
02:32:28,450 --> 02:32:28,630
Yeah.

5602
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:33,630
Then you do it like some guys like bill
Cosby to the end always just went on

5603
02:32:33,961 --> 02:32:34,380
stage.

5604
02:32:34,380 --> 02:32:34,891
Oh really?

5605
02:32:34,891 --> 02:32:35,220
Yeah.

5606
02:32:35,220 --> 02:32:36,270
He didn't have an opening act.

5607
02:32:36,390 --> 02:32:39,210
Bill Cosby would go on stage
for like two fucking hours.

5608
02:32:39,211 --> 02:32:40,590
He was a hundred thousand years old.

5609
02:32:40,591 --> 02:32:44,130
He would go on stage for two hours with
one eyeball and a hello spreads shirt

5610
02:32:44,430 --> 02:32:46,950
with a backlog of rape in his hand.

5611
02:32:47,310 --> 02:32:51,870
Somehow the fought through that I knew
to deliver this family friendly humor,

5612
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:55,910
one of the greatest comics of all.

5613
02:32:55,910 --> 02:32:59,520
It's like the most prolific and it goes
to your point that you can be more than

5614
02:32:59,521 --> 02:33:00,001
one thing.

5615
02:33:00,001 --> 02:33:01,290
It can be evil and good,

5616
02:33:01,610 --> 02:33:01,981
you know?

5617
02:33:01,981 --> 02:33:02,221
I mean,

5618
02:33:02,221 --> 02:33:04,190
he was a great classic example.

5619
02:33:05,250 --> 02:33:06,180
Damn Dude.

5620
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:07,860
Fuck Dude and no opening act.

5621
02:33:07,861 --> 02:33:08,820
Look at that hello friend.

5622
02:33:09,130 --> 02:33:09,711
Wow.

5623
02:33:09,711 --> 02:33:10,800
On stage like that.

5624
02:33:10,830 --> 02:33:11,663
Just with uh,

5625
02:33:11,730 --> 02:33:12,391
two hours.

5626
02:33:12,391 --> 02:33:17,310
Who knows how many rapes in his memory
banks just crushing his self esteem and

5627
02:33:17,311 --> 02:33:19,260
sought process and activity.

5628
02:33:19,470 --> 02:33:22,360
Had he been been accused when
he was doing standup as well?

5629
02:33:22,410 --> 02:33:23,243
Here's the crazy,

5630
02:33:23,510 --> 02:33:24,070
he,

5631
02:33:24,070 --> 02:33:24,780
he'd been accused.

5632
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:29,780
He's blind in one eye and
losing his vision in the
second on how these very old,

5633
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:32,120
but I think he's also pour it.

5634
02:33:32,150 --> 02:33:32,311
No,

5635
02:33:32,311 --> 02:33:32,851
he's still alive.

5636
02:33:32,851 --> 02:33:34,800
He's still went through the trial.

5637
02:33:34,970 --> 02:33:36,620
He did through one trial,

5638
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:38,850
his trial and then their
retrying him again.

5639
02:33:39,360 --> 02:33:40,193
I think it's,

5640
02:33:40,650 --> 02:33:41,850
I want to say it's coming up soon.

5641
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:45,540
That's stress usually kills
those look like Joe Paterno.

5642
02:33:45,541 --> 02:33:46,201
These that'll break.

5643
02:33:46,201 --> 02:33:47,460
Oh my God,

5644
02:33:47,461 --> 02:33:48,294
man.

5645
02:33:48,310 --> 02:33:50,670
Do you imagine a body of work though?

5646
02:33:50,671 --> 02:33:51,750
And then Justin matter,

5647
02:33:51,751 --> 02:33:52,600
but that's a TC.

5648
02:33:52,980 --> 02:33:54,720
It's what is the human being,

5649
02:33:54,750 --> 02:33:55,021
right?

5650
02:33:55,021 --> 02:33:58,680
What does it human being capable of and
the lowest thing you can do to someone

5651
02:33:58,681 --> 02:34:02,160
besides murder them is rape and two drug.

5652
02:34:02,161 --> 02:34:04,680
All these women that you took in there,

5653
02:34:04,710 --> 02:34:08,900
they were like confiding in you because
you're this great master of show

5654
02:34:08,901 --> 02:34:09,411
business.

5655
02:34:09,411 --> 02:34:10,710
You were Mr Hawks to blink.

5656
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:11,760
You would never believe it.

5657
02:34:11,790 --> 02:34:13,110
You wouldn't marry somebody told you,

5658
02:34:13,111 --> 02:34:14,160
you'd be like shut up.

5659
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:15,233
No Way.

5660
02:34:15,290 --> 02:34:17,190
The earth is flat before a bill Cosby.

5661
02:34:17,470 --> 02:34:18,490
That makes it easy.

5662
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:21,190
But don't you think this is a part of
what we were talking about earlier is that

5663
02:34:21,191 --> 02:34:23,020
the more information that gets out,

5664
02:34:23,050 --> 02:34:27,160
the more you understand like the Harvey
Weinsteins are the bill Cosby's of the

5665
02:34:27,190 --> 02:34:27,890
evil people,

5666
02:34:27,890 --> 02:34:31,360
the world that have gotten away with
it for so long because the power,

5667
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:34,180
but the more this stuff comes out,

5668
02:34:34,181 --> 02:34:34,750
the more we'll have.

5669
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:38,080
We have a more nuanced understanding
of what a human being is.

5670
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:39,700
Like Neal Brennan was talking about,

5671
02:34:39,730 --> 02:34:40,760
we were talking to the podcast,

5672
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:41,860
we're talking about Louis Ck.

5673
02:34:41,890 --> 02:34:42,371
I love him too.

5674
02:34:42,371 --> 02:34:43,204
He's great.

5675
02:34:43,330 --> 02:34:44,081
And we were talking about like,

5676
02:34:44,081 --> 02:34:46,930
do you think that it's possible
to be a really great comic?

5677
02:34:46,931 --> 02:34:49,480
Not Be fucked up in
some way and I was like,

5678
02:34:49,481 --> 02:34:50,314
no,

5679
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:51,610
never met one,

5680
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:52,570
never met one.

5681
02:34:52,570 --> 02:34:53,650
It might be possible.

5682
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:54,491
I've never seen it.

5683
02:34:54,491 --> 02:34:59,491
I think there's something about wanting
to crush on stage and figuring out like

5684
02:34:59,621 --> 02:35:03,610
how to do it and having those thoughts
inside you that people find so humorous,

5685
02:35:03,850 --> 02:35:07,690
those crazy impulsive thoughts and those,

5686
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:08,261
you know,

5687
02:35:08,261 --> 02:35:13,180
like deeply disturbing thoughts sometimes
where you're just scratching the base

5688
02:35:13,181 --> 02:35:16,600
layers of your psychology and
looking to see what makes it bleed.

5689
02:35:17,170 --> 02:35:17,870
You know though,

5690
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:22,180
it's hard to find that place when
you're a regular person with a regular

5691
02:35:22,181 --> 02:35:23,980
sensibilities and you fit into this,

5692
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:24,580
you know,

5693
02:35:24,580 --> 02:35:27,700
normal pattern me and might every now
and then get a really funny guy who comes

5694
02:35:27,701 --> 02:35:28,360
out of that,

5695
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:29,920
but most of them when
you get to know them,

5696
02:35:29,921 --> 02:35:31,450
you find some dark shit,

5697
02:35:31,451 --> 02:35:33,070
hundred percent artist,

5698
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:37,450
dysfunctional shit or unorthodox
trying to fill some hole.

5699
02:35:37,470 --> 02:35:38,200
Yeah,

5700
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:41,410
just almost different way of looking
at the all is in the outside.

5701
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:43,720
Outsiders outside of fighters as well.

5702
02:35:43,721 --> 02:35:44,351
It's the same thing.

5703
02:35:44,351 --> 02:35:47,440
I don't know any fighters at
somewhere in the back of their head.

5704
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:48,880
Do they not have this,

5705
02:35:48,881 --> 02:35:50,920
this one area where like,

5706
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:51,131
oh,

5707
02:35:51,131 --> 02:35:51,970
you got this spot.

5708
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,050
Most people don't have that spot.

5709
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:55,660
It was like this one area of darkness.

5710
02:35:55,690 --> 02:35:56,290
Yes.

5711
02:35:56,290 --> 02:35:56,900
You know?

5712
02:35:56,900 --> 02:35:57,733
Yes.

5713
02:35:58,150 --> 02:36:02,350
How many human beings do you think could
get to the psychological state that

5714
02:36:02,351 --> 02:36:04,870
Matt Brown gets into in full combat?

5715
02:36:05,500 --> 02:36:06,333
I mean how many,

5716
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:08,430
how many people have more that?

5717
02:36:08,650 --> 02:36:12,370
How many people have that level
of violence in their head?

5718
02:36:12,371 --> 02:36:13,630
In the face of like,

5719
02:36:13,900 --> 02:36:15,580
like real world class fighters.

5720
02:36:15,880 --> 02:36:19,690
The one thing that I love about Matt
Brown is every map Brown fight was a

5721
02:36:19,691 --> 02:36:22,190
motherfucking Matt Brown
fight and he knew it.

5722
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:23,500
He didn't seem to go in the cage like,

5723
02:36:23,501 --> 02:36:24,334
well,

5724
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:25,840
good for chaos.

5725
02:36:25,870 --> 02:36:28,990
You see how he got into the cage during
his last fight with Diego Sanchez?

5726
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:30,730
He roars.

5727
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:31,151
He,

5728
02:36:31,151 --> 02:36:34,590
they open up the cage door and he
just fucking throws his backed up

5729
02:36:36,610 --> 02:36:37,420
and it's real.

5730
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:42,420
It's not an act like this guy don it at
that level and he's lost and he's one,

5731
02:36:43,510 --> 02:36:44,620
he said ups and downs.

5732
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:46,600
Never a physically gifted guy.

5733
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:48,460
Not like some insanely fast,

5734
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:49,540
crazy athletics,

5735
02:36:50,110 --> 02:36:55,110
just explosive and Ahmad Rawhide and
steel cable and it's got a place that Bob

5736
02:36:57,280 --> 02:37:01,840
works in accounting and you know it was
his wife is fucking our personal trainer

5737
02:37:01,841 --> 02:37:04,930
and his kids call him a piece of shit
and he takes a Xanax every night.

5738
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:08,350
Rob Doesn't have that
place has brain Jamie,

5739
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:09,160
Jamie bring up,

5740
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:10,480
bring up Salma Hayek.

5741
02:37:10,481 --> 02:37:12,100
He was my monster too.

5742
02:37:12,250 --> 02:37:13,220
Oh yeah.

5743
02:37:13,750 --> 02:37:15,190
She says something about Harvey Weinstein.

5744
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:15,981
That's to your point.

5745
02:37:15,981 --> 02:37:16,730
Then she say,

5746
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:17,660
so she said,

5747
02:37:17,730 --> 02:37:18,563
uh,

5748
02:37:18,830 --> 02:37:19,730
it's a one sentence,

5749
02:37:19,731 --> 02:37:20,660
but it says everything.

5750
02:37:20,660 --> 02:37:21,700
It's the first time we do that.

5751
02:37:21,701 --> 02:37:23,030
I want to see Matt Brown roar.

5752
02:37:23,180 --> 02:37:24,260
You can't supersede the seat.

5753
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:28,140
I'm going to piggy back
on it trying to find it.

5754
02:37:28,870 --> 02:37:30,110
Do we need another guy?

5755
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:30,973
He retired.

5756
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:32,240
Yeah,

5757
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:32,631
he knows.

5758
02:37:32,631 --> 02:37:33,141
No though.

5759
02:37:33,141 --> 02:37:34,220
I talked to him in Boston.

5760
02:37:34,221 --> 02:37:37,460
He came to my show in Boston and
we actually talked on the phone,

5761
02:37:37,650 --> 02:37:38,690
but he was saying,

5762
02:37:38,691 --> 02:37:39,560
I don't know man.

5763
02:37:39,561 --> 02:37:39,851
He goes,

5764
02:37:39,851 --> 02:37:40,640
I mean,

5765
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:41,140
he goes,

5766
02:37:41,140 --> 02:37:41,660
I,

5767
02:37:41,660 --> 02:37:43,160
I was thinking of retiring,

5768
02:37:43,190 --> 02:37:44,220
but now I'm not sure.

5769
02:37:44,630 --> 02:37:48,920
It's tough if you're thinking about it
to his brother when he smashed Diego

5770
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:50,240
Sanchez with the craziest elbow,

5771
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:50,841
you don't,

5772
02:37:50,841 --> 02:37:51,321
oh my God,

5773
02:37:51,321 --> 02:37:52,010
it was so crazy.

5774
02:37:52,010 --> 02:37:55,120
Here's a thought on that Topo one.

5775
02:37:55,370 --> 02:37:57,500
This has been something that's
been going on for awhile.

5776
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:01,400
Like when is it okay and when is it not
okay to hit the back of the head where

5777
02:38:01,401 --> 02:38:02,420
it counts as a Kao,

5778
02:38:03,290 --> 02:38:03,560
right?

5779
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:04,790
Like if you do it on the ground,

5780
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:07,160
you can get severely disqualified,

5781
02:38:07,420 --> 02:38:08,120
right?

5782
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:12,230
Dqued or points taken away depending
on how much damage due to a person.

5783
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:13,161
But if you do it,

5784
02:38:13,161 --> 02:38:13,641
stand it up,

5785
02:38:13,641 --> 02:38:14,690
whether it's with a head kick,

5786
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:16,490
which a lot of times hits
the back of the neck,

5787
02:38:16,990 --> 02:38:18,800
it's if it's a movement,

5788
02:38:18,801 --> 02:38:19,230
right?

5789
02:38:19,230 --> 02:38:21,470
If it's in transition
and you hit the elbow,

5790
02:38:21,471 --> 02:38:22,304
you're good,

5791
02:38:23,090 --> 02:38:24,230
but on the ground it's not.

5792
02:38:24,231 --> 02:38:24,951
Here's my point.

5793
02:38:24,951 --> 02:38:27,350
Like if someone's squirming on the ground
and you throw an elbow and you hit him

5794
02:38:27,351 --> 02:38:28,184
in the back of the head,

5795
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:29,780
a lot of times they can take points away,

5796
02:38:30,290 --> 02:38:34,760
but isn't there a big difference between
doing something on purpose and doing

5797
02:38:34,761 --> 02:38:37,250
something in the the heat of the chaos?

5798
02:38:37,251 --> 02:38:39,860
Why is it okay standing
up and I think it is okay.

5799
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:43,730
I think Matt Blatt Brown's Kao of
Diego Sanchez is totally clean,

5800
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:48,410
but I think there's a reality to that
back of the head shot that happens with

5801
02:38:48,411 --> 02:38:50,480
neck kicks all the time,

5802
02:38:50,510 --> 02:38:51,170
all the time.

5803
02:38:51,170 --> 02:38:54,860
There's a reality to the effectiveness
of that technique that we accept standing

5804
02:38:54,861 --> 02:38:55,250
up,

5805
02:38:55,250 --> 02:38:57,740
but on the ground we limit that.

5806
02:38:57,950 --> 02:39:01,460
I think they're thinking on the ground
you have more control of the opponent.

5807
02:39:01,490 --> 02:39:02,630
I don't think that's real.

5808
02:39:02,750 --> 02:39:03,500
I don't either.

5809
02:39:03,500 --> 02:39:04,400
I don't think that's real.

5810
02:39:04,401 --> 02:39:05,061
I think guys,

5811
02:39:05,061 --> 02:39:05,894
when we set up,

5812
02:39:05,930 --> 02:39:09,860
they're bucking and squirming and
you're throwing shit and it takes time.

5813
02:39:09,890 --> 02:39:12,080
There's movement here
while you're throwing.

5814
02:39:12,081 --> 02:39:15,320
It's very rare that someone's completely
stationary while you're throwing.

5815
02:39:15,430 --> 02:39:16,263
They're awesome.

5816
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:18,140
They're also adjusting their,

5817
02:39:18,141 --> 02:39:20,390
they're going on a big shrimping.

5818
02:39:20,391 --> 02:39:21,111
You're bucking,

5819
02:39:21,111 --> 02:39:22,310
you're dropping down.

5820
02:39:22,460 --> 02:39:24,230
There's a lot of shit happened in man.

5821
02:39:24,231 --> 02:39:26,030
And the idea that somehow or another,

5822
02:39:26,031 --> 02:39:29,780
you should be able to control it on the
ground when you're actually in physical

5823
02:39:29,781 --> 02:39:30,950
contact with someone,

5824
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:31,371
right.

5825
02:39:31,371 --> 02:39:34,550
You have to be physically have their
body that you're trying to manipulate and

5826
02:39:34,551 --> 02:39:35,940
control while they're bucking around.

5827
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:38,420
It's hard versus they don't
have any control of your body.

5828
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:39,470
You're standing up,

5829
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:40,640
you're away from them.

5830
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:43,820
And any shot that you landed on the back
of the head somehow or another is okay.

5831
02:39:43,821 --> 02:39:47,300
It just shows you we have a little more
ways to go with evolution of fighting.

5832
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:47,930
Yeah.

5833
02:39:47,930 --> 02:39:49,490
I do look at some of
the rules and I'm like,

5834
02:39:49,491 --> 02:39:50,690
what the fuck?

5835
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:52,010
How do we still have these problems?

5836
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:52,851
Get judging.

5837
02:39:52,851 --> 02:39:53,061
I'm like,

5838
02:39:53,061 --> 02:39:55,200
God damn helmet.

5839
02:39:55,530 --> 02:39:57,740
Could you wear something on
the back of your headlight out?

5840
02:39:57,860 --> 02:39:59,630
They used to wear those
in taekwondo tournament.

5841
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:00,950
They used to give people these,

5842
02:40:00,951 --> 02:40:01,250
uh,

5843
02:40:01,250 --> 02:40:02,083
you wouldn't help.

5844
02:40:02,450 --> 02:40:06,230
There's a transition and taekwondo rules
where they started getting ready for

5845
02:40:06,231 --> 02:40:07,064
the Olympics,

5846
02:40:07,070 --> 02:40:09,560
where they started making
people wear actual helmets.

5847
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:11,700
You wore these big foam thing,

5848
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:12,200
me.

5849
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:15,090
But before that you'd have to wear
these things in the back of your head.

5850
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:16,280
The video I have it.

5851
02:40:16,280 --> 02:40:17,670
There's a video of me wearing one.

5852
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:19,110
The video of me,

5853
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:22,680
I always liked it better cause it
didn't fuck with your peripheral vision.

5854
02:40:22,810 --> 02:40:23,160
Right.

5855
02:40:23,160 --> 02:40:25,380
The idea is you get k
owed because we're all,

5856
02:40:25,381 --> 02:40:28,650
we were fighting on basketball
courts and what guys got Kol?

5857
02:40:28,910 --> 02:40:29,341
Who was he?

5858
02:40:29,341 --> 02:40:30,174
Video me fight.

5859
02:40:30,840 --> 02:40:31,331
Fuck yeah,

5860
02:40:31,331 --> 02:40:32,670
I do watch this.

5861
02:40:32,671 --> 02:40:33,504
This is me.

5862
02:40:35,060 --> 02:40:36,780
I'm the guy with the back to us.

5863
02:40:36,930 --> 02:40:38,160
But if you look at my head,

5864
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:41,610
that thing in the back of my
head is a raw red foam thing.

5865
02:40:41,611 --> 02:40:41,850
It's,

5866
02:40:41,850 --> 02:40:42,090
you know,

5867
02:40:42,090 --> 02:40:43,230
shitty old VHS.

5868
02:40:43,610 --> 02:40:48,240
But there's a Yamaka rubber band that
goes across my forehead in this pad is

5869
02:40:48,241 --> 02:40:49,350
just to keep my head.

5870
02:40:49,780 --> 02:40:50,581
He just fucked that.

5871
02:40:50,581 --> 02:40:50,940
Get up.

5872
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:51,510
Yeah.

5873
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:52,343
How old are you there?

5874
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:56,850
I was 19 that was at
the u s in Connecticut.

5875
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,230
Cc Connecticut on the floor.

5876
02:40:58,290 --> 02:41:00,140
Why'd you walk off like dead?

5877
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:01,250
I knew it was a rap.

5878
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:03,080
One of the other guys we shot.

5879
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:03,720
Yeah.

5880
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:05,990
Type one and all the other guys to
be scared cause I was terrified.

5881
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:06,833
Fucked up.

5882
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:07,141
Yeah,

5883
02:41:07,141 --> 02:41:07,770
that's a good thing.

5884
02:41:07,770 --> 02:41:11,820
My move was always to pretend like I
didn't give a fuck Kao guys and walk away.

5885
02:41:11,821 --> 02:41:12,654
Like it was nothing.

5886
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:13,710
I never celebrate.

5887
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:17,520
Never like it's just another day in the
office because it scared the shit out of

5888
02:41:17,521 --> 02:41:17,701
me.

5889
02:41:17,701 --> 02:41:19,790
So I was tried to be like one of the
guys that scared the shit out of me.

5890
02:41:19,791 --> 02:41:20,624
What I do.

5891
02:41:20,670 --> 02:41:21,001
Yeah.

5892
02:41:21,001 --> 02:41:22,080
And then it was what I do.

5893
02:41:22,081 --> 02:41:22,950
But I was like this is weird.

5894
02:41:22,951 --> 02:41:24,090
I'm like a fraud but I'm not.

5895
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:26,850
I think those guys are like that.

5896
02:41:27,450 --> 02:41:28,630
Most buyers are like that.

5897
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:30,030
But those,

5898
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:35,030
those head things were a standard and
then they changed it to pat at floor.

5899
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:36,540
They changed the floor.

5900
02:41:36,770 --> 02:41:37,650
They used to let you fight.

5901
02:41:37,651 --> 02:41:38,790
Why Fun on a hockey rink.

5902
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:39,701
I found him,

5903
02:41:39,701 --> 02:41:41,820
the bay state games on concrete,

5904
02:41:41,850 --> 02:41:42,840
there was a plastic,

5905
02:41:42,841 --> 02:41:47,070
a thin plastic sheet that was over
concrete and when the dude's head hit the

5906
02:41:47,071 --> 02:41:47,391
mat,

5907
02:41:47,391 --> 02:41:52,110
it cut him open cause like I owed him
and when I hit him in the wheel kick,

5908
02:41:52,320 --> 02:41:57,320
his head bounced off the ground and his
eyebrow opened up from contacting the

5909
02:41:58,201 --> 02:41:59,034
concrete.

5910
02:41:59,190 --> 02:42:01,200
It was so disturbing.

5911
02:42:01,540 --> 02:42:03,450
It was like that easily
could have been me.

5912
02:42:03,750 --> 02:42:08,420
I easily could've got head kicked and my
head bounces off the fucking concrete.

5913
02:42:08,430 --> 02:42:09,330
That was like practice.

5914
02:42:09,331 --> 02:42:10,810
When you go to practice and tackle known,

5915
02:42:10,820 --> 02:42:13,680
you knew you were going to spar somebody
who's going to get kicked in the head

5916
02:42:13,681 --> 02:42:15,750
if they weren't careful when
somebody would do the chicken,

5917
02:42:15,751 --> 02:42:15,991
like I said,

5918
02:42:15,991 --> 02:42:20,340
they would always be a guy once a month
would get hit and just it was what you

5919
02:42:20,341 --> 02:42:21,560
guys were that had get her.

5920
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:23,670
Now my tier helps.

5921
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:24,870
It definitely helps.

5922
02:42:24,871 --> 02:42:26,460
Like it'll protect your head a little bit.

5923
02:42:26,850 --> 02:42:29,880
It's definitely better than nothing
but getting kicked out because they're

5924
02:42:29,881 --> 02:42:30,714
pretty sweet though.

5925
02:42:31,230 --> 02:42:32,160
Here's Matt Brown.

5926
02:42:32,370 --> 02:42:33,031
Here's Matt Brown.

5927
02:42:33,031 --> 02:42:34,920
When he steps in to fight Diego Sanchez,

5928
02:42:34,921 --> 02:42:36,300
he roars the head coach.

5929
02:42:36,301 --> 02:42:37,260
Now they're in Denver.

5930
02:42:37,990 --> 02:42:38,370
No,

5931
02:42:38,370 --> 02:42:41,190
he's definitely one of the
top coaches over there.

5932
02:42:41,191 --> 02:42:43,590
And didn't they just open up a place here?

5933
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:43,950
Hit,

5934
02:42:43,950 --> 02:42:45,600
did they somewhere around self harm?

5935
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:47,640
I think they opened up a place in Burbank.

5936
02:42:47,670 --> 02:42:49,440
He's such a fucking animal.

5937
02:42:49,460 --> 02:42:51,390
This is what one of my all time favorite.

5938
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:53,180
He just cause I gotta check my Dick.

5939
02:42:53,740 --> 02:42:53,980
Cause like,

5940
02:42:53,980 --> 02:42:54,810
cause you have a cup on.

5941
02:42:54,810 --> 02:42:56,370
He goes yes and taps his own dick.

5942
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:59,670
They get a check his fingernails
and watch us steps up to the cage.

5943
02:42:59,671 --> 02:43:01,590
Thinks this is his last
fight ever walks in

5944
02:43:03,710 --> 02:43:04,543
Doug

5945
02:43:06,230 --> 02:43:07,920
[inaudible] man,

5946
02:43:08,430 --> 02:43:10,440
that roar is a warrior.

5947
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:11,890
So for a guy,

5948
02:43:12,570 --> 02:43:13,740
the guy's got this awesome.

5949
02:43:13,990 --> 02:43:14,411
Yeah,

5950
02:43:14,411 --> 02:43:15,890
he died for um,

5951
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:19,000
a bit overdoing or drug overdose
and they brought them back.

5952
02:43:19,170 --> 02:43:19,780
Yeah.

5953
02:43:19,780 --> 02:43:21,220
But it's like for a guy like that,

5954
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:23,470
that style is just so,

5955
02:43:23,590 --> 02:43:24,610
it's so hard.

5956
02:43:24,670 --> 02:43:25,930
That's such a hard style.

5957
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:26,681
So crazy.

5958
02:43:26,681 --> 02:43:28,300
That's not like a mighty mouse guy.

5959
02:43:28,301 --> 02:43:29,140
That's not a,

5960
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:29,680
you know,

5961
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:33,040
just a guy who just grind very skillful,

5962
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:33,910
no doubt about it.

5963
02:43:34,630 --> 02:43:35,361
Great timing.

5964
02:43:35,361 --> 02:43:35,741
Thing was,

5965
02:43:35,741 --> 02:43:36,071
is that,

5966
02:43:36,071 --> 02:43:37,120
and we tie was ever,

5967
02:43:37,140 --> 02:43:38,470
it's clinch was very good.

5968
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:39,670
His muay Thai is very good,

5969
02:43:39,671 --> 02:43:41,080
but his Jujitsu is very good dude.

5970
02:43:41,081 --> 02:43:42,880
It's just super underrated.

5971
02:43:43,230 --> 02:43:48,230
Really get hit with that is toughness
was world plus she's striking in his

5972
02:43:48,491 --> 02:43:48,821
ground.

5973
02:43:48,821 --> 02:43:49,180
You wouldn't,

5974
02:43:49,180 --> 02:43:51,070
you wouldn't say it was world class.

5975
02:43:51,150 --> 02:43:52,720
I just feel like fighting.

5976
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:54,160
That's no disrespect.

5977
02:43:54,161 --> 02:43:54,850
I'm saying,

5978
02:43:54,850 --> 02:43:55,580
you know,

5979
02:43:55,580 --> 02:43:58,810
his ground game was at like
a Verducci is striking.

5980
02:43:58,811 --> 02:43:59,860
Was it like a wonder boy?

5981
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:01,220
He's good at everything.

5982
02:44:01,430 --> 02:44:04,780
So do you think specialists
besides and toughness?

5983
02:44:05,870 --> 02:44:06,360
Yeah,

5984
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:09,150
I'm not throwing shade at Brendan.

5985
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:10,750
Do you think that if you took,

5986
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:11,620
if fighting

5987
02:44:13,390 --> 02:44:16,690
was as a profitable,

5988
02:44:16,691 --> 02:44:17,530
say as baseball,

5989
02:44:17,531 --> 02:44:17,951
basketball,

5990
02:44:17,951 --> 02:44:18,410
football,

5991
02:44:18,410 --> 02:44:20,200
we'd obviously have very
different athletes in the game.

5992
02:44:20,610 --> 02:44:21,220
Oh yeah.

5993
02:44:21,220 --> 02:44:23,010
But I just wonder like,

5994
02:44:23,150 --> 02:44:23,700
I don't know.

5995
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:24,080
Yeah,

5996
02:44:24,080 --> 02:44:24,320
I,

5997
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:25,480
I wonder if,

5998
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:26,673
um,

5999
02:44:27,370 --> 02:44:30,580
if athleticism plays as big a part in the,

6000
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:34,270
in fighting and it's in the umbrella
of fighting as it does in say,

6001
02:44:34,271 --> 02:44:35,170
basketball football.

6002
02:44:35,171 --> 02:44:36,070
So if I,

6003
02:44:36,080 --> 02:44:38,230
you're either making the NFL or the NBA,

6004
02:44:38,910 --> 02:44:39,743
you know,

6005
02:44:39,820 --> 02:44:41,290
there's a lot to the game of course.

6006
02:44:41,291 --> 02:44:44,170
But I feel like athletics
and plays a bigger factor.

6007
02:44:44,171 --> 02:44:47,970
Like some guys it can be not as athletic
and a lot of ways like George Saint

6008
02:44:47,970 --> 02:44:48,810
Pierre still be good and fun.

6009
02:44:48,820 --> 02:44:49,930
It's still fucking,

6010
02:44:49,990 --> 02:44:50,471
wait a minute,

6011
02:44:50,471 --> 02:44:50,830
hold on.

6012
02:44:50,830 --> 02:44:51,251
What'd you say?

6013
02:44:51,251 --> 02:44:52,120
Not Athletic,

6014
02:44:52,320 --> 02:44:52,710
George.

6015
02:44:52,710 --> 02:44:53,920
George Saint Peter's not that bad.

6016
02:44:53,960 --> 02:44:54,110
No,

6017
02:44:54,110 --> 02:44:54,970
it's a great athlete.

6018
02:44:54,971 --> 02:44:56,380
But now the judge is a bad example.

6019
02:44:56,680 --> 02:44:58,420
You want to say a guy
like he's a bad example.

6020
02:44:58,421 --> 02:44:58,840
Actually,

6021
02:44:58,840 --> 02:44:59,673
Nick Diaz,

6022
02:44:59,950 --> 02:45:00,783
Nick Diaz,

6023
02:45:01,630 --> 02:45:02,111
Nick Diaz,

6024
02:45:02,111 --> 02:45:04,390
who was just amazing,

6025
02:45:04,391 --> 02:45:05,860
like it's never been knocked out.

6026
02:45:06,310 --> 02:45:08,020
And Josh Thomson knocked him out.

6027
02:45:08,250 --> 02:45:08,680
Yeah,

6028
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:09,100
yeah.

6029
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:10,220
He had kicked him style.

6030
02:45:11,530 --> 02:45:15,190
It was all before the
Hoffeld dos Anjos fight.

6031
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:17,200
He lost the dose on Joel's after that.

6032
02:45:17,201 --> 02:45:19,740
And then after that he's the
only one Michael Johnson.

6033
02:45:19,741 --> 02:45:22,480
And then after that he comments
the x factor with fighting.

6034
02:45:22,481 --> 02:45:25,570
Where were guys who are not as fast,

6035
02:45:25,571 --> 02:45:27,210
not as strong man is
what they can't tell him,

6036
02:45:27,220 --> 02:45:29,170
say not as all that other stuff.

6037
02:45:29,860 --> 02:45:32,680
Somehow are able to close that distance.

6038
02:45:32,681 --> 02:45:33,700
Let me rephrase that.

6039
02:45:33,730 --> 02:45:35,740
Nate got stopped by Josh Thompson.

6040
02:45:35,741 --> 02:45:36,580
Never went unconscious.

6041
02:45:36,610 --> 02:45:39,210
He went to kid rock killed
by Nick [inaudible].

6042
02:45:39,250 --> 02:45:39,670
Nick.

6043
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:40,061
Oh No,

6044
02:45:40,061 --> 02:45:40,820
Nick's never been.

6045
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:41,200
No,

6046
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:41,501
no,

6047
02:45:41,501 --> 02:45:41,741
no.

6048
02:45:41,741 --> 02:45:46,741
Nick got stopped early on in his
career by that guy who did tough.

6049
02:45:46,871 --> 02:45:48,370
Who wound up Jeremy?

6050
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:50,460
Jeremy Stephens?

6051
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:50,711
No,

6052
02:45:50,711 --> 02:45:51,544
Jeremy Jones.

6053
02:45:51,550 --> 02:45:52,383
Is that his name?

6054
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:55,780
He was a young guy that was really
talented and nick and him both fought when

6055
02:45:55,781 --> 02:46:00,130
they were both like 18 or 19
and nick got stopped by him.

6056
02:46:00,160 --> 02:46:00,993
He TK,

6057
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:03,100
TK,

6058
02:46:03,100 --> 02:46:03,430
no,

6059
02:46:03,430 --> 02:46:03,641
no,

6060
02:46:03,641 --> 02:46:06,430
never loads and he's flat line and he's,

6061
02:46:06,431 --> 02:46:07,870
he's fought the best of the best,

6062
02:46:07,871 --> 02:46:08,231
the best,

6063
02:46:08,231 --> 02:46:09,920
but that guy was super talented.

6064
02:46:09,921 --> 02:46:10,040
Yeah,

6065
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:12,140
that guy was super talented
but then went to jail,

6066
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:13,370
went to jail for some shit.

6067
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:19,240
I think fighting requires a different
skillset but when you get a guy who has

6068
02:46:20,481 --> 02:46:22,560
that warrior spirit who's athletic,

6069
02:46:22,561 --> 02:46:23,150
yeah.

6070
02:46:23,150 --> 02:46:25,070
Then you have problems
like the Francis and gun.

6071
02:46:25,071 --> 02:46:28,370
Right or you know or like
have it all in mighty mouse,

6072
02:46:28,430 --> 02:46:29,263
Calvin gas,

6073
02:46:29,270 --> 02:46:30,060
Conor McGregor.

6074
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:31,790
Yet you get these guys who were,

6075
02:46:32,030 --> 02:46:35,480
could probably play other sports like
Conor McGregor in there as an athlete in

6076
02:46:35,481 --> 02:46:39,590
terms like God really fuck disability to
perform under pressure's undeniable and

6077
02:46:39,591 --> 02:46:41,960
that that is a lot of what
I feel that this is a mess.

6078
02:46:42,140 --> 02:46:42,920
It's movements.

6079
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:43,521
Fantastic.

6080
02:46:43,521 --> 02:46:45,900
It was body to lot of what athleticism is,

6081
02:46:45,901 --> 02:46:47,690
is effective use of that body.

6082
02:46:47,691 --> 02:46:51,710
Like you can't deny that a guy who was
a world class fighter is also a great

6083
02:46:51,711 --> 02:46:52,340
athlete.

6084
02:46:52,340 --> 02:46:53,960
There's just no room for that anymore.

6085
02:46:54,170 --> 02:46:56,870
Everybody who's at the top of the
food chain is a great athlete.

6086
02:46:56,871 --> 02:47:01,040
Obviously Francis is an outlier because
he's such an obviously amazing athlete.

6087
02:47:01,050 --> 02:47:02,420
I think Thomas is an outlier to the,

6088
02:47:02,421 --> 02:47:04,910
we can go backwards and reaction time,

6089
02:47:05,100 --> 02:47:07,390
but he's a fucking outlier outline.

6090
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:12,890
Think about also Woodley's ability to
hurt Wonderboy in the two fights that he

6091
02:47:12,891 --> 02:47:15,620
had put Wonderboy and more
trouble than he's ever been.

6092
02:47:15,880 --> 02:47:19,070
That we've seen them in sight except
for Matt Brown who stopped him cause he

6093
02:47:19,071 --> 02:47:20,840
stopped when we did
beat him in a decision.

6094
02:47:20,900 --> 02:47:21,830
I think he'd beat him on decision,

6095
02:47:21,831 --> 02:47:23,570
but beat the shit out of
them for three rounds.

6096
02:47:23,571 --> 02:47:27,150
Let's look at a guy like Darren till
the Kelp Bagan athletic until ethic.

6097
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:28,280
He's a big boy.

6098
02:47:28,281 --> 02:47:28,910
I'm sure.

6099
02:47:28,910 --> 02:47:29,091
Yeah,

6100
02:47:29,091 --> 02:47:31,430
there's a lot of guys,

6101
02:47:32,570 --> 02:47:35,410
but there's two different
weight classes but I,

6102
02:47:35,690 --> 02:47:36,523
different weight classes,

6103
02:47:36,780 --> 02:47:39,200
but I think he's about 25.

6104
02:47:40,180 --> 02:47:40,670
Good.

6105
02:47:40,670 --> 02:47:41,000
Luke.

6106
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,770
Luke can fight it to a
five if you want it to.

6107
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:43,310
Yeah,

6108
02:47:43,310 --> 02:47:44,120
but um,

6109
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:48,470
I think the day and age you're
always going to have those guys in.

6110
02:47:48,471 --> 02:47:49,251
This isn't a knock,

6111
02:47:49,251 --> 02:47:51,410
but those Leonard Garcia
is with Matt browns.

6112
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:52,910
You're going to have those guys.

6113
02:47:52,911 --> 02:47:55,250
But the evolution of the
UFC and mixed martial arts,

6114
02:47:55,430 --> 02:47:56,870
those guys are going to slowly fades away.

6115
02:47:56,871 --> 02:47:59,570
You can get better athletes
and just being tough.

6116
02:47:59,720 --> 02:48:01,430
Is it going to get you
in the top 10 anymore?

6117
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:02,810
I think you're going to get guys who,

6118
02:48:02,990 --> 02:48:04,100
they have the fighter's mentality,

6119
02:48:04,101 --> 02:48:08,720
but they're the super athletes and that's
the evolution of the sport both cause

6120
02:48:08,721 --> 02:48:09,930
you get like a Roy MacDonald,

6121
02:48:10,110 --> 02:48:11,000
really good athlete,

6122
02:48:11,270 --> 02:48:14,690
a fucking monster at everything and he,

6123
02:48:14,691 --> 02:48:14,961
you know,

6124
02:48:14,961 --> 02:48:15,261
he has,

6125
02:48:15,261 --> 02:48:16,130
he can do both.

6126
02:48:16,160 --> 02:48:18,840
What do you think of that Lima fight
that's coming up that's not qualified?

6127
02:48:18,870 --> 02:48:19,703
20th Yup.

6128
02:48:19,780 --> 02:48:20,340
That's great.

6129
02:48:20,340 --> 02:48:21,230
We're going to be in Boston.

6130
02:48:21,260 --> 02:48:23,020
That's the same night as the a in Ghana.

6131
02:48:23,030 --> 02:48:25,000
Fight a fight.

6132
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:26,900
They're going head to
head and head to head.

6133
02:48:26,930 --> 02:48:29,270
I think Shalan rampage
is on that to your dvrs.

6134
02:48:29,271 --> 02:48:29,781
Ready folks?

6135
02:48:29,781 --> 02:48:33,330
Can we talk a little
bit about home sidebar,

6136
02:48:34,640 --> 02:48:36,620
Battle of the greatest
woman fighter of all time?

6137
02:48:36,630 --> 02:48:38,720
I think everyone's up but is,

6138
02:48:38,900 --> 02:48:39,800
but is that the case?

6139
02:48:39,801 --> 02:48:40,041
Right?

6140
02:48:40,041 --> 02:48:44,840
Because Meesha beats sidebar or
Meesha beat Holly never fought Cyborg,

6141
02:48:44,841 --> 02:48:47,960
but the way she beat Holly
was so fucking spectacular.

6142
02:48:48,140 --> 02:48:51,080
How do you not always
rank Meesha above Holly?

6143
02:48:51,170 --> 02:48:52,040
I know Misha,

6144
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:56,930
it retired and Holly is still super active
and likely should have been 145 pound

6145
02:48:56,931 --> 02:48:57,291
champion.

6146
02:48:57,291 --> 02:48:59,270
Especially if you take
away the deductions,

6147
02:48:59,271 --> 02:48:59,990
right enemy,

6148
02:48:59,990 --> 02:49:02,930
she should have gotten some
bullshit for too late shots.

6149
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:04,400
And then even on top of that,

6150
02:49:04,401 --> 02:49:08,430
you still see like Holly dropped her with
a head kick and then dropped him with

6151
02:49:08,431 --> 02:49:09,540
a left hand as well.

6152
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:13,240
How he was also beating Misha
in that fight before she was.

6153
02:49:13,300 --> 02:49:17,250
But those two rounds where
she got dominated to here's
my one round mounted and

6154
02:49:17,251 --> 02:49:18,180
couldn't do shit about it.

6155
02:49:18,181 --> 02:49:20,340
And then the last 15 seconds is a fine.

6156
02:49:20,700 --> 02:49:21,990
Misha pulls out the ultimate,

6157
02:49:21,991 --> 02:49:22,530
takes her down,

6158
02:49:22,530 --> 02:49:25,320
takes her back and it chokes her
to sleep for the best for sure.

6159
02:49:25,321 --> 02:49:26,670
But if we're going to play that game,

6160
02:49:26,671 --> 02:49:27,960
then Holly,

6161
02:49:28,740 --> 02:49:29,491
Merck,

6162
02:49:29,491 --> 02:49:31,680
the girl who Meesha could
never even hold a candle.

6163
02:49:31,970 --> 02:49:32,803
Ronda Rousey.

6164
02:49:32,820 --> 02:49:33,211
That's true.

6165
02:49:33,211 --> 02:49:36,030
But don't you think that Misha kept
getting better and that the Meesha who

6166
02:49:36,031 --> 02:49:36,810
fought,

6167
02:49:36,810 --> 02:49:41,810
I think the Meesha that fought against
Holly Holm was very much an improved

6168
02:49:42,571 --> 02:49:44,380
version of the Meesha that
fought against Rhonda.

6169
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:46,350
But that me shut,

6170
02:49:46,380 --> 02:49:46,651
right?

6171
02:49:46,651 --> 02:49:46,950
She,

6172
02:49:46,950 --> 02:49:49,080
her whole thing is grappling.

6173
02:49:49,530 --> 02:49:49,820
Yeah.

6174
02:49:49,820 --> 02:49:53,370
So it try implementing that game
plan that gets Rhonda grappling.

6175
02:49:53,371 --> 02:49:54,204
Enjoy that.

6176
02:49:54,320 --> 02:49:57,410
[inaudible] stand up as one of
the reasons why she was good.

6177
02:49:57,640 --> 02:49:59,800
She got better than she
did in the early Rhonda.

6178
02:49:59,860 --> 02:50:00,420
Rhonda.

6179
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:01,620
She did so did Rhonda.

6180
02:50:01,740 --> 02:50:02,460
Yeah,

6181
02:50:02,460 --> 02:50:03,000
she might.

6182
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:03,833
She might take step back.

6183
02:50:04,170 --> 02:50:06,150
But here's my problem event.

6184
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:07,410
You got to look at Amanda Nunez,

6185
02:50:07,440 --> 02:50:08,071
Amanda Nunez,

6186
02:50:08,071 --> 02:50:09,780
Pete the shit out of the both of them.

6187
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:11,640
And the way she did it was like,

6188
02:50:11,670 --> 02:50:12,503
yeah,

6189
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,500
points her cry.

6190
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:16,770
The way she throws like
those warm of Bang Bang on.

6191
02:50:17,010 --> 02:50:17,670
She's yes,

6192
02:50:17,670 --> 02:50:18,900
she's a mandating as is.

6193
02:50:18,901 --> 02:50:19,734
Yikes.

6194
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:20,491
Yikes.

6195
02:50:20,491 --> 02:50:21,900
And I wish you got more promotional.

6196
02:50:21,901 --> 02:50:23,980
Push just hammers at.

6197
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:24,470
She's,

6198
02:50:24,470 --> 02:50:25,231
if Holly Holm,

6199
02:50:25,231 --> 02:50:26,790
we're able to pull off this upset.

6200
02:50:26,970 --> 02:50:28,080
She's number one for me.

6201
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:33,320
Beating Ronda and her prime beaten Cyborg
in a private Cyborg is fucking scary,

6202
02:50:33,511 --> 02:50:33,840
man.

6203
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:34,673
She be lies.

6204
02:50:34,890 --> 02:50:36,030
Cyborg is always be lined.

6205
02:50:36,031 --> 02:50:36,570
Everybody,

6206
02:50:36,570 --> 02:50:39,870
she just comes straight in and
puts so much pressure on you.

6207
02:50:40,360 --> 02:50:40,910
Last fight,

6208
02:50:40,910 --> 02:50:41,310
Tanya,

6209
02:50:41,310 --> 02:50:42,210
if she went,

6210
02:50:42,240 --> 02:50:42,850
you know what,

6211
02:50:42,850 --> 02:50:44,760
here's my [inaudible] just
going to murder this girl.

6212
02:50:44,880 --> 02:50:46,350
Watch them stick behind the Jab.

6213
02:50:46,390 --> 02:50:47,430
I'm gonna figure some things out.

6214
02:50:47,440 --> 02:50:51,360
It doesn't show Holly has a way better
chance because if she does that with

6215
02:50:51,361 --> 02:50:53,580
Holly where she says I'm,

6216
02:50:53,581 --> 02:50:54,750
cause I think she's got,

6217
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:55,200
she's,

6218
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:56,011
she's been training.

6219
02:50:56,011 --> 02:50:58,720
I mean I think it's almost like she's
been training with somebody different.

6220
02:50:58,730 --> 02:50:59,670
So take your time.

6221
02:50:59,970 --> 02:51:00,803
Step back.

6222
02:51:01,010 --> 02:51:02,030
Best Bucklin coaching.

6223
02:51:02,220 --> 02:51:02,821
That's actually,

6224
02:51:02,821 --> 02:51:05,010
that actually favors Holly I think.

6225
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:06,540
Then her old style,

6226
02:51:06,541 --> 02:51:11,541
which is to come in close Batali that
if she booked comes at Holly lights'll

6227
02:51:12,030 --> 02:51:13,050
like Rhonda did.

6228
02:51:13,051 --> 02:51:13,260
Yeah,

6229
02:51:13,260 --> 02:51:14,430
he kicked in the face.

6230
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:15,011
That's different.

6231
02:51:15,011 --> 02:51:17,800
There was no with with Cyborg is she?

6232
02:51:17,880 --> 02:51:18,780
She's so strong.

6233
02:51:18,781 --> 02:51:19,080
She's,

6234
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:19,440
you know,

6235
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:19,980
covers off.

6236
02:51:19,980 --> 02:51:20,610
She's calculate.

6237
02:51:20,610 --> 02:51:21,840
Here's the other x factor.

6238
02:51:22,050 --> 02:51:23,130
If cyber goes,

6239
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:23,880
uh,

6240
02:51:23,880 --> 02:51:25,560
Holly kind of sucks on the ground.

6241
02:51:25,830 --> 02:51:27,000
I'm a black belt on the ground.

6242
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:28,950
I also can grapple like a motherfucker.

6243
02:51:29,130 --> 02:51:30,600
I'm not just going to stand and stretch.

6244
02:51:30,610 --> 02:51:30,780
Give you,

6245
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:31,441
I'm going to take you there.

6246
02:51:31,441 --> 02:51:32,820
And she's a naturally larger woman.

6247
02:51:32,850 --> 02:51:33,541
She's way bigger.

6248
02:51:33,541 --> 02:51:37,170
So she gets against the get paid an hour
tees issues been trying on pick Tito

6249
02:51:37,170 --> 02:51:37,350
Ortiz up.

6250
02:51:37,350 --> 02:51:37,621
Yeah.

6251
02:51:37,621 --> 02:51:38,880
Is She black now?

6252
02:51:38,940 --> 02:51:39,773
She's like,

6253
02:51:39,880 --> 02:51:40,200
yeah,

6254
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:42,090
and she's competed as a brown belt.

6255
02:51:42,091 --> 02:51:46,020
I know she did very well and
some high level competition.

6256
02:51:46,350 --> 02:51:47,910
She's a big woman.

6257
02:51:48,390 --> 02:51:49,320
Her and Debbie Garcia.

6258
02:51:49,321 --> 02:51:50,080
Go add it.

6259
02:51:50,080 --> 02:51:50,820
Grappling.

6260
02:51:50,820 --> 02:51:51,121
Yeah.

6261
02:51:51,121 --> 02:51:51,890
That's crazy.

6262
02:51:51,890 --> 02:51:52,310
Yeah,

6263
02:51:52,310 --> 02:51:53,770
and if she decides any partner,

6264
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:56,100
she decides to go on
me should tape footage.

6265
02:51:56,101 --> 02:51:56,550
Yes.

6266
02:51:56,550 --> 02:51:59,790
And see how easy Nisha
Choke Talia Cardone.

6267
02:52:00,540 --> 02:52:01,980
That's in her back pocket and she goes,

6268
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:02,580
all right,

6269
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:03,150
I'm the feet.

6270
02:52:03,150 --> 02:52:04,080
Let's get a little tricky.

6271
02:52:04,230 --> 02:52:05,430
I'm going to grapple shirt.

6272
02:52:05,431 --> 02:52:07,240
She has a hard time making 45 right?

6273
02:52:07,540 --> 02:52:07,811
Yes,

6274
02:52:07,811 --> 02:52:08,380
she does.

6275
02:52:08,380 --> 02:52:08,620
Yeah.

6276
02:52:08,620 --> 02:52:12,010
She would be better off if there's
a 155 pound woman's weight class.

6277
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:13,360
She didn't have to cut so much weight.

6278
02:52:14,020 --> 02:52:14,380
Yeah.

6279
02:52:14,380 --> 02:52:15,460
I mean she's leaned out.

6280
02:52:15,461 --> 02:52:18,400
She looks leaner now that she did
when she was fighting in Strikeforce.

6281
02:52:18,401 --> 02:52:18,581
You know,

6282
02:52:18,581 --> 02:52:20,230
I think when she fought like Gina Carano,

6283
02:52:20,231 --> 02:52:21,940
she was fucking gigantic.

6284
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,410
She's much smaller now.

6285
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:24,580
It's such a good fight though.

6286
02:52:24,581 --> 02:52:25,414
But she's still,

6287
02:52:25,810 --> 02:52:27,660
she's still a destroyer.

6288
02:52:27,680 --> 02:52:28,090
Yeah.

6289
02:52:28,090 --> 02:52:28,481
You know,

6290
02:52:28,481 --> 02:52:29,314
it's like,

6291
02:52:29,710 --> 02:52:34,710
I think for a lot of fighters I feel
like she's finally got to it where she,

6292
02:52:35,201 --> 02:52:36,370
she deserves this.

6293
02:52:36,730 --> 02:52:39,790
But she definitely deserves
this big high profile fight.

6294
02:52:39,791 --> 02:52:40,810
But so does Holly,

6295
02:52:41,080 --> 02:52:41,261
you know,

6296
02:52:41,261 --> 02:52:41,981
they both do.

6297
02:52:41,981 --> 02:52:46,480
This is a really interesting fight
because like clearly Holly's dangerous,

6298
02:52:46,510 --> 02:52:46,781
right?

6299
02:52:46,781 --> 02:52:47,531
She head kicks,

6300
02:52:47,531 --> 02:52:48,760
Rhonda knocks her out,

6301
02:52:48,761 --> 02:52:51,040
she head kicks Batchko
hey on knocked her out.

6302
02:52:51,190 --> 02:52:53,140
She had kicked Germane to random,

6303
02:52:53,141 --> 02:52:58,141
he was a multiple time world
Moitai champion head kicks
her drops her and a lot

6304
02:52:58,901 --> 02:53:00,430
of people thought she should
have got that decision.

6305
02:53:00,430 --> 02:53:03,430
At the very least it was super fucking
close and Jermaine's one of the best

6306
02:53:03,431 --> 02:53:04,300
strikers in the world.

6307
02:53:04,510 --> 02:53:05,130
She's a,

6308
02:53:05,130 --> 02:53:06,670
she's a nasty strikes.

6309
02:53:06,671 --> 02:53:11,671
So then if Holly and Cyborg
just strike who gets the edge?

6310
02:53:11,770 --> 02:53:12,450
Well it see that.

6311
02:53:12,450 --> 02:53:13,001
Here's the thing,

6312
02:53:13,001 --> 02:53:14,860
like you can't sleep on Holly,

6313
02:53:14,861 --> 02:53:19,150
like she's probably got a disadvantage
when it comes to punching power.

6314
02:53:19,151 --> 02:53:22,960
And probably a significant mean we won't,

6315
02:53:22,961 --> 02:53:23,411
we really know.

6316
02:53:23,411 --> 02:53:26,710
Cause Holly has dropped people and she
does have sharp punches and she's an 18

6317
02:53:26,711 --> 02:53:28,390
time world women's boxing champion.

6318
02:53:28,391 --> 02:53:28,960
I mean she's,

6319
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:32,320
there's a lot of craziness to
what Holly was able to do as a,

6320
02:53:32,321 --> 02:53:33,550
as a striker with her hands.

6321
02:53:33,551 --> 02:53:34,930
Holly's more decorated.

6322
02:53:34,931 --> 02:53:37,390
It's our street striking cyber hits.

6323
02:53:37,630 --> 02:53:41,500
She hits so fucking hard
and she's so aggressive.

6324
02:53:41,501 --> 02:53:41,771
Did you,

6325
02:53:41,771 --> 02:53:43,330
did you see a Cyborg,

6326
02:53:43,390 --> 02:53:43,810
uh,

6327
02:53:43,810 --> 02:53:47,770
going against the gold medalist
in the female box on the ward?

6328
02:53:47,770 --> 02:53:49,270
I think Clarissa shields that is,

6329
02:53:49,750 --> 02:53:50,380
that is her name.

6330
02:53:50,380 --> 02:53:50,740
Yeah.

6331
02:53:50,740 --> 02:53:51,311
Did you see him?

6332
02:53:51,311 --> 02:53:52,270
You send me that footage.

6333
02:53:52,330 --> 02:53:54,930
It's amazing you sit that Manet.

6334
02:53:55,050 --> 02:53:55,883
I mean,

6335
02:53:56,200 --> 02:53:57,730
Claressa shields is no joke.

6336
02:53:57,760 --> 02:53:57,881
No,

6337
02:53:57,881 --> 02:54:00,140
she's up Beth buses.

6338
02:54:00,290 --> 02:54:01,031
You bring that up.

6339
02:54:01,031 --> 02:54:01,864
It's crazy.

6340
02:54:02,140 --> 02:54:02,890
It's crazy.

6341
02:54:02,890 --> 02:54:04,570
It's fun to watch too because you realize,

6342
02:54:04,571 --> 02:54:04,811
okay,

6343
02:54:04,811 --> 02:54:06,160
well she can hang in the pocket.

6344
02:54:06,161 --> 02:54:07,390
She takes a tremendous shot.

6345
02:54:07,690 --> 02:54:09,520
If you really want to
be impressed by Cyborg,

6346
02:54:09,550 --> 02:54:13,180
I say you look at her one
Moitai loss to Juliana.

6347
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:15,730
I didn't cars.

6348
02:54:15,820 --> 02:54:16,210
Yeah,

6349
02:54:16,210 --> 02:54:17,590
she's in Bellator kickboxing now.

6350
02:54:17,620 --> 02:54:19,810
Zarina Bart is a monster.

6351
02:54:20,080 --> 02:54:25,080
She's this really tall woman from Holland
who's got outstanding technique and

6352
02:54:25,211 --> 02:54:26,044
she was haunted.

6353
02:54:26,140 --> 02:54:27,130
Nobody was fucking with her.

6354
02:54:27,131 --> 02:54:28,630
She couldn't get a fight for years.

6355
02:54:29,050 --> 02:54:31,300
So she's given her some coaching here.

6356
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:31,910
So,

6357
02:54:31,910 --> 02:54:36,010
so cyborg decided to fight that Moy
Tai Monster and it went to a decision.

6358
02:54:36,330 --> 02:54:37,690
Cyborg landed some good shots.

6359
02:54:37,930 --> 02:54:38,231
Yeah.

6360
02:54:38,231 --> 02:54:39,890
Not only did it go to a decision to,

6361
02:54:39,920 --> 02:54:41,500
I'm working on a new tattoos on her legs.

6362
02:54:41,560 --> 02:54:41,891
No,

6363
02:54:41,891 --> 02:54:42,640
that's tape.

6364
02:54:42,640 --> 02:54:43,540
That's like uh,

6365
02:54:43,790 --> 02:54:44,440
uh,

6366
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:46,760
performance tape on the top and oh wow.

6367
02:54:46,870 --> 02:54:47,321
How weird.

6368
02:54:47,321 --> 02:54:48,170
It's all criss crossing.

6369
02:54:48,171 --> 02:54:49,004
Yeah,

6370
02:54:49,030 --> 02:54:49,721
it's a shitty video.

6371
02:54:49,721 --> 02:54:50,340
Huh?

6372
02:54:50,340 --> 02:54:50,990
Um,

6373
02:54:50,990 --> 02:54:51,761
it's awful video.

6374
02:54:51,761 --> 02:54:54,610
But you cyborg got
dropped a bunch of times,

6375
02:54:54,611 --> 02:54:55,900
kept getting up,

6376
02:54:56,170 --> 02:54:56,411
you know,

6377
02:54:56,411 --> 02:55:00,850
came after her and was there for the
fucking final bells to swing and trying to

6378
02:55:00,851 --> 02:55:01,351
take her out.

6379
02:55:01,351 --> 02:55:03,040
Thai girl had had her hands full,

6380
02:55:03,130 --> 02:55:04,040
going to walk in the park.

6381
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:06,170
It was not a walk in
the pauses specialist.

6382
02:55:06,410 --> 02:55:08,580
And she's so good during the bar.

6383
02:55:08,940 --> 02:55:09,561
Watch her fight.

6384
02:55:09,561 --> 02:55:10,400
She's so good.

6385
02:55:11,270 --> 02:55:14,480
So here's a cyborg sparring
with look how good this girl is,

6386
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:15,861
but look,

6387
02:55:15,861 --> 02:55:18,890
sideboard and that she's hanging in there.

6388
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:19,371
Yeah.

6389
02:55:19,371 --> 02:55:22,280
She goes to the head of
the doing work though.

6390
02:55:22,280 --> 02:55:23,000
She is,

6391
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:24,140
she's so good man.

6392
02:55:24,200 --> 02:55:24,541
But the,

6393
02:55:24,541 --> 02:55:25,730
these girls are going at it.

6394
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:28,250
This is not like a light sparring session.

6395
02:55:28,280 --> 02:55:29,510
This is almost like a fight,

6396
02:55:30,020 --> 02:55:30,321
you know?

6397
02:55:30,321 --> 02:55:33,890
And she's got to be careful because
Cyborg has big fucking power.

6398
02:55:34,010 --> 02:55:36,680
So she's treating this like this
is a dangerous fight for her.

6399
02:55:36,710 --> 02:55:37,190
Look,

6400
02:55:37,190 --> 02:55:38,300
she's landing these shots,

6401
02:55:38,301 --> 02:55:40,880
but she's realizing like that
stuff that's coming her way,

6402
02:55:41,030 --> 02:55:42,890
she can't take one of those
on the point of the chin.

6403
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:43,250
No,

6404
02:55:43,250 --> 02:55:44,300
she's getting tagged.

6405
02:55:44,570 --> 02:55:46,640
Look at this sidewalk
tagged a couple times,

6406
02:55:46,940 --> 02:55:50,210
but she's clearly like the more
polished professional boxer.

6407
02:55:50,260 --> 02:55:51,011
I'm a Cyborg.

6408
02:55:51,011 --> 02:55:51,801
It's doing work.

6409
02:55:51,801 --> 02:55:52,061
Does she?

6410
02:55:52,061 --> 02:55:52,830
Is she is doing,

6411
02:55:52,830 --> 02:55:54,890
you're not like a left hook to the body.

6412
02:55:54,891 --> 02:55:55,030
It's,

6413
02:55:55,030 --> 02:55:55,371
Ooh,

6414
02:55:55,371 --> 02:55:56,870
that's step in left hook to the body.

6415
02:55:57,580 --> 02:55:58,550
Oh that's pretty,

6416
02:55:59,540 --> 02:56:00,373
she's so good.

6417
02:56:00,440 --> 02:56:05,440
It's so important for a girl like her to
get that kind of sparring it into hell.

6418
02:56:05,510 --> 02:56:05,900
Yeah.

6419
02:56:05,900 --> 02:56:07,550
I mean who the fuck wants
to spar with Cyborg?

6420
02:56:07,890 --> 02:56:11,270
Oh one came about cyber stalking
about Nolan would spar with her.

6421
02:56:11,300 --> 02:56:11,980
So this girl was like,

6422
02:56:11,980 --> 02:56:12,650
I'll do it.

6423
02:56:12,650 --> 02:56:13,340
Wow.

6424
02:56:13,340 --> 02:56:14,060
Let her kick Ya.

6425
02:56:14,060 --> 02:56:16,160
I gotta say that I got arrested.

6426
02:56:17,400 --> 02:56:19,640
That muy Thai fight
with that was it close?

6427
02:56:19,850 --> 02:56:20,241
It was a,

6428
02:56:20,241 --> 02:56:22,550
it was a clear unanimous decision,

6429
02:56:22,551 --> 02:56:24,080
but it was dangerous at every turn.

6430
02:56:24,110 --> 02:56:24,620
Yeah.

6431
02:56:24,620 --> 02:56:25,740
And also that woman doesn't,

6432
02:56:25,741 --> 02:56:26,550
that's her thing.

6433
02:56:26,550 --> 02:56:27,770
Have more respect for cyber.

6434
02:56:27,771 --> 02:56:28,604
You have to watch it.

6435
02:56:28,690 --> 02:56:30,230
She wasn't gonna win,

6436
02:56:30,231 --> 02:56:31,400
but she fucking did work.

6437
02:56:31,490 --> 02:56:33,500
She got head kicked with a stomp.

6438
02:56:33,530 --> 02:56:37,280
She got like front push kick to the face
like right on the chin or the next snap

6439
02:56:37,281 --> 02:56:37,671
back.

6440
02:56:37,671 --> 02:56:38,504
She falls down,

6441
02:56:38,660 --> 02:56:42,710
she gets up and you still chasing
after she's a warrior man.

6442
02:56:42,711 --> 02:56:44,250
She's a fucking warrior.

6443
02:56:44,690 --> 02:56:45,530
But so's Holly.

6444
02:56:45,680 --> 02:56:48,510
Holly just comes off
like cleaner and like,

6445
02:56:48,860 --> 02:56:49,131
you know,

6446
02:56:49,131 --> 02:56:53,240
she comes off like more polished
and she's very pretty and it's very,

6447
02:56:53,241 --> 02:56:57,290
she's very calm and very kind
and nice to hear her talk.

6448
02:56:57,320 --> 02:56:58,160
I think we're a female.

6449
02:56:58,161 --> 02:56:58,941
Fighting's add that,

6450
02:56:58,941 --> 02:56:59,240
you know,

6451
02:56:59,240 --> 02:57:02,780
it's such a high level now with these
two that whoever wins this is the best of

6452
02:57:02,781 --> 02:57:03,350
all time.

6453
02:57:03,350 --> 02:57:05,060
I think it's the forefront
of the feminist movement.

6454
02:57:05,360 --> 02:57:05,691
Boom,

6455
02:57:05,691 --> 02:57:05,991
boom,

6456
02:57:05,991 --> 02:57:06,824
boom.

6457
02:57:07,610 --> 02:57:08,630
No pressure ladies.

6458
02:57:08,780 --> 02:57:09,613
No worries.

6459
02:57:09,710 --> 02:57:10,310
Um,

6460
02:57:10,310 --> 02:57:10,820
it's,

6461
02:57:10,820 --> 02:57:12,680
it's a very important fight for the sport,

6462
02:57:12,681 --> 02:57:13,514
that's for sure.

6463
02:57:13,630 --> 02:57:13,880
You know,

6464
02:57:13,880 --> 02:57:15,410
because no one really out there,

6465
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:17,630
who in my mind is compelling,

6466
02:57:17,690 --> 02:57:20,850
is willing to step in and challenge
cyborg other than Holly will they still

6467
02:57:20,851 --> 02:57:22,310
gonna fight like Andre Arlovski,

6468
02:57:22,340 --> 02:57:23,600
frank mayor back in the day,

6469
02:57:23,601 --> 02:57:27,080
there's no one or Tim Silvia
Beltour who's who would,

6470
02:57:27,081 --> 02:57:29,780
who would do work and it's a good point.

6471
02:57:29,960 --> 02:57:30,590
Good question.

6472
02:57:30,590 --> 02:57:31,190
Email.

6473
02:57:31,190 --> 02:57:33,890
I don't think they're at the same
level yet in the female division,

6474
02:57:33,891 --> 02:57:35,270
but there's some real good talent there.

6475
02:57:35,300 --> 02:57:35,481
It's,

6476
02:57:35,481 --> 02:57:38,600
there's some good female
talent in MMA period,

6477
02:57:38,601 --> 02:57:38,960
right?

6478
02:57:38,960 --> 02:57:39,511
Rose yachting,

6479
02:57:39,511 --> 02:57:40,460
Nama,

6480
02:57:40,460 --> 02:57:41,181
Jameson Yawning and jack that,

6481
02:57:41,181 --> 02:57:41,421
that,

6482
02:57:41,421 --> 02:57:43,580
that rematch is going to be sick.

6483
02:57:43,910 --> 02:57:44,151
Yeah,

6484
02:57:44,151 --> 02:57:45,440
that's an interesting rematch.

6485
02:57:46,100 --> 02:57:46,933
You gotta throw up.

6486
02:57:47,020 --> 02:57:47,840
I'm getting close.

6487
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:48,201
Really?

6488
02:57:48,201 --> 02:57:48,381
Yeah.

6489
02:57:48,381 --> 02:57:51,680
I didn't eat all day and I drink all
this caffeine really swallow and spit and

6490
02:57:51,681 --> 02:57:52,970
so then I bought a garbage can.

6491
02:57:53,080 --> 02:57:54,930
I know you got to get this little sick.

6492
02:57:56,030 --> 02:57:56,870
I just go throw it.

6493
02:57:57,540 --> 02:57:58,900
Throw up like a Chai Mike.

6494
02:57:58,910 --> 02:57:59,151
Man.

6495
02:57:59,151 --> 02:57:59,701
I might purge.

6496
02:57:59,701 --> 02:58:02,130
Just go deer stick.

6497
02:58:02,570 --> 02:58:02,791
Yeah,

6498
02:58:02,791 --> 02:58:03,300
that a no,

6499
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:03,871
that doesn't help,

6500
02:58:03,871 --> 02:58:04,260
right?

6501
02:58:04,260 --> 02:58:06,840
Don't you want pork chops and a cigar?

6502
02:58:08,010 --> 02:58:08,700
I'm feeling,

6503
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:09,430
I'm feeling nauseous.

6504
02:58:09,430 --> 02:58:11,010
Have a couple of pork
chops and smoke a cigar.

6505
02:58:11,011 --> 02:58:11,491
He will be fine.

6506
02:58:11,491 --> 02:58:13,680
How about sausage sub
would extra mustard gas.

6507
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:16,530
I got the call my breath.

6508
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:17,973
Hmm.

6509
02:58:18,020 --> 02:58:18,750
Um,

6510
02:58:18,750 --> 02:58:19,980
despite is important man,

6511
02:58:20,200 --> 02:58:21,240
it's important for the sport,

6512
02:58:21,241 --> 02:58:21,421
right?

6513
02:58:21,421 --> 02:58:22,950
It's important to figure out what,

6514
02:58:23,130 --> 02:58:24,870
what style you need to beat Cyborg.

6515
02:58:24,871 --> 02:58:25,890
Like Tanya have injured,

6516
02:58:25,891 --> 02:58:29,940
just fought a wild sort of brawling
style and that like very limited success.

6517
02:58:29,941 --> 02:58:33,150
But it was like one of those things
where Cyborg just keeps advancing and in

6518
02:58:33,151 --> 02:58:33,984
every exchange,

6519
02:58:34,040 --> 02:58:36,120
every time she's so much more firepower.

6520
02:58:36,150 --> 02:58:37,100
But Evan jurists,

6521
02:58:37,160 --> 02:58:37,500
you know,

6522
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:38,500
she was trying to win that fight.

6523
02:58:38,501 --> 02:58:39,360
As tough as they go.

6524
02:58:39,420 --> 02:58:39,800
Yeah.

6525
02:58:39,800 --> 02:58:40,770
She was trying to win that fight.

6526
02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:44,460
This is a different fight cause Holly
is very dangerous and she has a weird

6527
02:58:44,461 --> 02:58:45,120
style.

6528
02:58:45,120 --> 02:58:46,590
She'll fight karate style.

6529
02:58:46,710 --> 02:58:48,000
She throws sidekicks,

6530
02:58:48,150 --> 02:58:49,450
a lot of front leg sidekicks.

6531
02:58:49,490 --> 02:58:50,430
She throws those,

6532
02:58:50,490 --> 02:58:52,410
those oblique kicks to the inner thigh.

6533
02:58:52,710 --> 02:58:53,880
And here's the thing,

6534
02:58:54,120 --> 02:58:56,990
Holly might be going
to go to the bathroom,

6535
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:57,781
go to the bathroom.

6536
02:58:57,781 --> 02:58:57,881
Yeah,

6537
02:58:57,881 --> 02:58:59,120
you've finished this weird.

6538
02:58:59,550 --> 02:59:00,190
This is weird.

6539
02:59:00,190 --> 02:59:01,470
It's going to start eating in the morning.

6540
02:59:03,270 --> 02:59:04,620
He's trying to fast.

6541
02:59:04,680 --> 02:59:06,230
He's doing some fascinating married.

6542
02:59:06,260 --> 02:59:07,200
He's really gonna throw up.

6543
02:59:07,970 --> 02:59:08,940
He's going to throw up man.

6544
02:59:10,090 --> 02:59:11,580
I wanted to get that on camera.

6545
02:59:11,820 --> 02:59:12,331
No,

6546
02:59:12,331 --> 02:59:13,164
that's not right.

6547
02:59:13,770 --> 02:59:14,321
That's not right.

6548
02:59:14,321 --> 02:59:16,860
It did it did that shut the
whole loop playing on a loop.

6549
02:59:17,190 --> 02:59:17,810
Yeah.

6550
02:59:17,810 --> 02:59:19,110
No people right now,

6551
02:59:19,440 --> 02:59:20,040
bro.

6552
02:59:20,040 --> 02:59:21,570
What the fuck did you let them puke?

6553
02:59:21,870 --> 02:59:22,321
He'll do that.

6554
02:59:22,321 --> 02:59:24,120
He'll just not eat like we'll do podcasts.

6555
02:59:24,121 --> 02:59:24,361
He's like,

6556
02:59:24,361 --> 02:59:24,870
I haven't eat.

6557
02:59:24,870 --> 02:59:25,471
You haven't eaten yet.

6558
02:59:25,471 --> 02:59:26,340
I don't want to smell it.

6559
02:59:26,670 --> 02:59:30,060
I don't want him to throw up in
that garbage can eat carbs can,

6560
02:59:30,510 --> 02:59:30,630
yeah.

6561
02:59:30,630 --> 02:59:31,463
That's not the move.

6562
02:59:31,780 --> 02:59:33,800
And it's a bunch of stuff in that can too.

6563
02:59:34,240 --> 02:59:37,740
It's like all bile to try blah.

6564
02:59:39,450 --> 02:59:40,560
You know what I ate last night today?

6565
02:59:40,620 --> 02:59:42,060
I made elk tar tar.

6566
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:42,800
Really?

6567
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:43,160
Uh,

6568
02:59:43,160 --> 02:59:43,980
so good.

6569
02:59:43,980 --> 02:59:45,360
Fuck you make a good.

6570
02:59:45,390 --> 02:59:45,991
So good.

6571
02:59:45,991 --> 02:59:47,400
Make a good game meat.

6572
02:59:47,540 --> 02:59:47,760
Yeah,

6573
02:59:47,760 --> 02:59:48,421
I get good at it.

6574
02:59:48,421 --> 02:59:48,830
Now.

6575
02:59:48,830 --> 02:59:49,430
Need a little,

6576
02:59:49,430 --> 02:59:49,740
um,

6577
02:59:49,740 --> 02:59:51,050
need a little game meat from,

6578
02:59:51,060 --> 02:59:52,050
I've got a shit ton.

6579
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:52,590
I need to,

6580
02:59:52,590 --> 02:59:52,771
yeah,

6581
02:59:52,771 --> 02:59:53,790
I got some here for you.

6582
02:59:53,791 --> 02:59:55,230
Eight and maybe,

6583
02:59:55,590 --> 02:59:55,741
I mean,

6584
02:59:55,741 --> 02:59:57,210
I love that you give me the hammer.

6585
02:59:57,211 --> 02:59:58,180
Can I get some I gave you,

6586
02:59:58,420 --> 02:59:59,520
I'll give you a heart,

6587
02:59:59,521 --> 03:00:00,060
dude.

6588
03:00:00,060 --> 03:00:01,620
That is the best part is delicious.

6589
03:00:01,650 --> 03:00:02,920
I gave you one of the Elkhart's.

6590
03:00:02,940 --> 03:00:03,773
I know this isn't,

6591
03:00:03,930 --> 03:00:04,230
no,

6592
03:00:04,230 --> 03:00:04,681
I'm never,

6593
03:00:04,681 --> 03:00:06,960
ever given anyone a
Elkhart the fuck out of it.

6594
03:00:07,050 --> 03:00:07,791
You can have some stakes,

6595
03:00:07,791 --> 03:00:07,911
bro.

6596
03:00:07,911 --> 03:00:09,720
You just can't have all
of them greedy bitch.

6597
03:00:09,780 --> 03:00:10,920
You gotta go out and kill your own food.

6598
03:00:10,980 --> 03:00:11,161
Yeah.

6599
03:00:11,161 --> 03:00:12,270
But you won't invite me.

6600
03:00:12,330 --> 03:00:12,601
Ah,

6601
03:00:12,601 --> 03:00:13,860
that's not the tram of 60 pound,

6602
03:00:13,861 --> 03:00:14,840
but what I want to do is,

6603
03:00:16,360 --> 03:00:16,740
yeah,

6604
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:17,400
well let's do that.

6605
03:00:17,400 --> 03:00:18,930
But you're only doing archery,

6606
03:00:18,931 --> 03:00:19,171
right?

6607
03:00:19,171 --> 03:00:19,410
Pretty.

6608
03:00:19,410 --> 03:00:19,980
Pretty much.

6609
03:00:19,980 --> 03:00:20,600
Yeah.

6610
03:00:20,600 --> 03:00:22,530
So I got to get good with
our trade before I can come.

6611
03:00:23,070 --> 03:00:23,903
Yeah.

6612
03:00:24,050 --> 03:00:25,560
That's a boy.

6613
03:00:25,590 --> 03:00:26,430
That's a hard one.

6614
03:00:26,460 --> 03:00:27,600
That's a weird learn on the job.

6615
03:00:27,601 --> 03:00:29,280
One shooting arrows at animals.

6616
03:00:29,281 --> 03:00:31,470
You've got to be completely
obsessed with doing that.

6617
03:00:31,500 --> 03:00:31,950
Yeah.

6618
03:00:31,950 --> 03:00:33,180
You've got a um,

6619
03:00:33,240 --> 03:00:34,073
or not,

6620
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:34,913
you know,

6621
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:35,640
honestly,

6622
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:38,040
the reality is rifle is more,

6623
03:00:38,520 --> 03:00:40,380
it's more affective.

6624
03:00:40,650 --> 03:00:41,011
Like you,

6625
03:00:41,011 --> 03:00:42,810
we'll shoot more things with a rifle.

6626
03:00:42,811 --> 03:00:44,130
You don't have to get as close.

6627
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:47,350
They're not going to move while you're
shooting a rifle and you bring up yeah.

6628
03:00:47,730 --> 03:00:48,181
For sure.

6629
03:00:48,181 --> 03:00:48,570
Yeah.

6630
03:00:48,570 --> 03:00:48,781
Yeah.

6631
03:00:48,781 --> 03:00:50,730
If you're in an area
that allows both things.

6632
03:00:50,770 --> 03:00:51,090
Yeah.

6633
03:00:51,090 --> 03:00:52,050
It depends on where you're going.

6634
03:00:52,070 --> 03:00:53,130
Cause I know I have to get an elk.

6635
03:00:53,550 --> 03:00:53,911
Yeah.

6636
03:00:53,911 --> 03:00:57,420
Seeing what else they have specific
seasons or you're allowed to.

6637
03:00:57,421 --> 03:00:58,080
Um,

6638
03:00:58,080 --> 03:01:02,380
most of the time during the Rut you
have to use archery equipment in most

6639
03:01:02,381 --> 03:01:03,214
places.

6640
03:01:03,580 --> 03:01:04,540
Some places have different,

6641
03:01:04,541 --> 03:01:05,374
there's like some,

6642
03:01:05,770 --> 03:01:06,480
some different,

6643
03:01:06,480 --> 03:01:08,320
let you use all weapons and some,

6644
03:01:08,321 --> 03:01:10,000
they have some special tags,

6645
03:01:10,420 --> 03:01:11,500
but like during the rot,

6646
03:01:11,501 --> 03:01:12,400
when they're breeding,

6647
03:01:12,730 --> 03:01:14,800
the idea is that it's easy to find them.

6648
03:01:14,801 --> 03:01:15,220
They're all,

6649
03:01:15,220 --> 03:01:20,220
they're all howling and making those
Elk Lake Wales and they're distracted by

6650
03:01:20,441 --> 03:01:24,970
pussy and to get close enough to shoot
him with a bow and Arrow way more

6651
03:01:24,971 --> 03:01:27,790
difficult cause you could just
purchase yourself on a fucking,

6652
03:01:28,270 --> 03:01:28,691
you know,

6653
03:01:28,691 --> 03:01:32,350
a nice tree stump and let that
site just settle perfectly on it.

6654
03:01:32,380 --> 03:01:33,340
If you have a rifle and just,

6655
03:01:33,341 --> 03:01:34,690
but boom and they're dead,

6656
03:01:34,780 --> 03:01:35,260
they're dead.

6657
03:01:35,260 --> 03:01:37,750
As soon as you pull the
trigger or as a bow and Arrow,

6658
03:01:37,780 --> 03:01:40,900
you really should be getting
inside of 40 yards if you can.

6659
03:01:40,901 --> 03:01:41,291
Hard.

6660
03:01:41,291 --> 03:01:41,680
Right.

6661
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:42,491
It's very hard.

6662
03:01:42,491 --> 03:01:42,851
Smell.

6663
03:01:42,851 --> 03:01:44,110
Smell you like crazy.

6664
03:01:44,111 --> 03:01:45,490
They see your movement.

6665
03:01:45,491 --> 03:01:48,790
They're constantly tuned in and turned
on and you have to fight off the fact

6666
03:01:48,791 --> 03:01:51,160
that there's like if a bull elk,

6667
03:01:51,161 --> 03:01:52,000
you're trying to shoot a bull elk,

6668
03:01:52,001 --> 03:01:54,550
you might have 30 cows that
are around that bull elk.

6669
03:01:54,580 --> 03:01:56,080
You gotta trick them to.

6670
03:01:56,110 --> 03:01:56,710
Oh Shit.

6671
03:01:56,710 --> 03:01:57,000
Yeah.

6672
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:58,270
You got 30 sets of eyes,

6673
03:01:58,271 --> 03:02:01,060
60 eyeballs looking at
your way and they bark.

6674
03:02:01,120 --> 03:02:03,710
You throw up a little
green under the gills boys.

6675
03:02:03,720 --> 03:02:04,553
You really puke.

6676
03:02:04,600 --> 03:02:04,740
Yeah,

6677
03:02:04,740 --> 03:02:05,320
I did.

6678
03:02:05,320 --> 03:02:06,520
Did you want some water or something?

6679
03:02:06,580 --> 03:02:06,741
No,

6680
03:02:06,741 --> 03:02:07,271
I'm good now,

6681
03:02:07,271 --> 03:02:07,800
man.

6682
03:02:07,800 --> 03:02:08,633
Damn son.

6683
03:02:09,120 --> 03:02:09,460
Ah,

6684
03:02:09,460 --> 03:02:10,293
that's weird.

6685
03:02:10,480 --> 03:02:12,790
Withdrawals from the heroin do.

6686
03:02:12,791 --> 03:02:13,660
What do you wish it was?

6687
03:02:13,661 --> 03:02:14,494
The head.

6688
03:02:14,960 --> 03:02:15,793
The Pale.

6689
03:02:15,940 --> 03:02:16,480
I know I do.

6690
03:02:16,480 --> 03:02:17,530
I need to hear us a little messy.

6691
03:02:17,560 --> 03:02:17,801
I know.

6692
03:02:17,801 --> 03:02:19,030
I looked in the math that you don't,

6693
03:02:19,031 --> 03:02:20,320
you look like shit man.

6694
03:02:20,440 --> 03:02:21,880
How much caffeine did you drink?

6695
03:02:22,150 --> 03:02:22,690
Well,

6696
03:02:22,690 --> 03:02:23,381
I had a,

6697
03:02:23,381 --> 03:02:24,190
uh,

6698
03:02:24,190 --> 03:02:26,620
a latte with an extra
shot on the way here,

6699
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:28,270
that three cups this morning.

6700
03:02:28,480 --> 03:02:31,220
But then I drank this thing
who never stopped drinking.

6701
03:02:31,221 --> 03:02:33,220
He drank the caveman
and then you drank that.

6702
03:02:33,221 --> 03:02:36,310
Other than that I can't get the French
press and I haven't eaten today cause I

6703
03:02:36,311 --> 03:02:37,360
fast in the morning.

6704
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:39,370
That's a lot of caffeine.

6705
03:02:39,750 --> 03:02:42,010
Does you go crazy for Christmas?

6706
03:02:42,580 --> 03:02:43,413
No,

6707
03:02:43,510 --> 03:02:44,000
no I didn't.

6708
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:45,340
I shouldn't cheat on Christmas.

6709
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:46,833
What are you saying?

6710
03:02:46,920 --> 03:02:48,430
Are you saying that he's like a,

6711
03:02:48,460 --> 03:02:49,300
he's got a weight issue.

6712
03:02:49,320 --> 03:02:49,540
He,

6713
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:50,810
he tends to um,

6714
03:02:51,040 --> 03:02:51,873
been,

6715
03:02:52,030 --> 03:02:52,740
no I don't.

6716
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:53,561
I've been super strict.

6717
03:02:53,561 --> 03:02:54,970
I haven't cheated since a thanksgiving.

6718
03:02:54,980 --> 03:02:55,511
Secretly.

6719
03:02:55,511 --> 03:02:59,140
Sometimes we'll go crazy on not when
I'm striking like this Quito kid is back

6720
03:02:59,141 --> 03:02:59,590
bitch.

6721
03:02:59,590 --> 03:03:00,180
Wow.

6722
03:03:00,180 --> 03:03:01,120
Kio Kid is back.

6723
03:03:01,150 --> 03:03:01,840
I'm back.

6724
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:02,830
I didn't mean to cut you bitch.

6725
03:03:02,920 --> 03:03:03,700
I'm sorry.

6726
03:03:03,700 --> 03:03:04,421
How the males,

6727
03:03:04,421 --> 03:03:06,390
the pizza and you tried
pescatarian for a while.

6728
03:03:06,391 --> 03:03:07,000
How did that go?

6729
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:07,580
Nah,

6730
03:03:07,580 --> 03:03:08,830
Quito is the only thing that works for me.

6731
03:03:08,831 --> 03:03:10,210
It's not for everyone
but Kido works for me.

6732
03:03:10,240 --> 03:03:13,040
But is it work for you in terms
of the way you feel or way?

6733
03:03:13,060 --> 03:03:13,600
I feel,

6734
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:13,930
yeah,

6735
03:03:13,930 --> 03:03:14,471
the way I feel.

6736
03:03:14,471 --> 03:03:15,310
It's easier to stick to,

6737
03:03:15,311 --> 03:03:16,720
but the way I feel when I'm on it,

6738
03:03:17,050 --> 03:03:18,190
I don't want to cheat.

6739
03:03:18,191 --> 03:03:19,180
I don't want carbs.

6740
03:03:19,181 --> 03:03:20,470
I don't want that food anymore.

6741
03:03:20,471 --> 03:03:21,160
So I'm good.

6742
03:03:21,160 --> 03:03:23,260
I go between Kido and low carb.

6743
03:03:23,350 --> 03:03:23,680
Yeah.

6744
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:26,710
And then occasionally I'll fuck
off and have like a Pastrami sub.

6745
03:03:26,711 --> 03:03:27,970
I call that Quito Ish.

6746
03:03:28,180 --> 03:03:33,180
I do a thing where I go through whole
foods and Erewhon and if I'll look at

6747
03:03:33,371 --> 03:03:34,300
people and I try to,

6748
03:03:34,301 --> 03:03:36,010
I try to spot the vegans.

6749
03:03:36,350 --> 03:03:36,930
Ah.

6750
03:03:36,930 --> 03:03:37,800
And I,

6751
03:03:37,870 --> 03:03:39,970
this is so me and they live glasses.

6752
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:40,240
Boy,

6753
03:03:40,240 --> 03:03:40,960
when I see,

6754
03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:41,800
when I see,

6755
03:03:41,801 --> 03:03:42,310
uh,

6756
03:03:42,310 --> 03:03:45,970
somebody super pale and drawn
out and they just look sunken in,

6757
03:03:46,030 --> 03:03:47,250
I'll look in their cart and that's it.

6758
03:03:47,260 --> 03:03:52,260
Right now they've got oats and some
seaweed and it's just all vegan stuff.

6759
03:03:52,291 --> 03:03:53,124
And while I was like,

6760
03:03:53,140 --> 03:03:54,460
you could use a little protein.

6761
03:03:54,490 --> 03:03:54,980
Wow.

6762
03:03:54,980 --> 03:03:56,860
This really is just some
people who are just doing it.

6763
03:03:57,250 --> 03:03:57,450
Yeah.

6764
03:03:57,450 --> 03:03:58,040
That's really what it

6765
03:03:58,040 --> 03:03:58,281
is.

6766
03:03:58,281 --> 03:03:59,114
You can do it right,

6767
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:00,560
but it's just like Quito,

6768
03:04:00,620 --> 03:04:03,290
like it requires a lot
of thinking and planning.

6769
03:04:03,530 --> 03:04:04,363
Like in order to,

6770
03:04:04,530 --> 03:04:04,820
I've,

6771
03:04:04,820 --> 03:04:06,860
I've seen people argued online,

6772
03:04:06,861 --> 03:04:07,231
so stu,

6773
03:04:07,231 --> 03:04:08,830
but nobody ever gets to ketosis.

6774
03:04:08,850 --> 03:04:09,560
Bullshit.

6775
03:04:09,560 --> 03:04:10,161
Of course they do.

6776
03:04:10,161 --> 03:04:10,850
Stupid.

6777
03:04:10,850 --> 03:04:11,650
Of course they do.

6778
03:04:11,650 --> 03:04:12,650
It's measurable.

6779
03:04:12,830 --> 03:04:14,660
People do it and they find benefit to it.

6780
03:04:14,661 --> 03:04:16,540
Some people don't find
benefit to it though.

6781
03:04:16,580 --> 03:04:16,731
It's,

6782
03:04:16,731 --> 03:04:17,960
but it's important to point out,

6783
03:04:18,140 --> 03:04:21,050
it's not hard to get
into a state of ketosis.

6784
03:04:21,051 --> 03:04:22,640
You just have to do what's required.

6785
03:04:22,680 --> 03:04:22,920
Yeah,

6786
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:23,930
it can be done.

6787
03:04:23,931 --> 03:04:25,190
It's not difficult to get to.

6788
03:04:25,191 --> 03:04:27,560
And the idea that nobody
gets there is just so wrong.

6789
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:29,030
People get there all the time.

6790
03:04:29,240 --> 03:04:30,910
It's a matter of whether
or not getting there.

6791
03:04:30,911 --> 03:04:31,850
It will be good for you.

6792
03:04:32,150 --> 03:04:34,790
I'll have people email me
or on social media like,

6793
03:04:34,791 --> 03:04:35,031
dude,

6794
03:04:35,031 --> 03:04:36,320
Kiddo is stupid man.

6795
03:04:36,321 --> 03:04:36,950
You can't,

6796
03:04:36,950 --> 03:04:38,840
you can't do that for a long time.

6797
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:39,771
It's not for me.

6798
03:04:39,771 --> 03:04:40,604
I'm like,

6799
03:04:41,050 --> 03:04:41,450
man,

6800
03:04:41,450 --> 03:04:43,820
I don't give a fuck it just from Pennside.

6801
03:04:44,480 --> 03:04:47,720
Dom D'agostino has been on it
forever and he's been on it forever.

6802
03:04:47,721 --> 03:04:50,720
But Rhonda Patrick was on the other day
and she was pointing out how with some

6803
03:04:50,721 --> 03:04:53,570
people it's not the
right diet for your boss.

6804
03:04:53,571 --> 03:04:54,950
For me it probably doesn't.

6805
03:04:55,010 --> 03:04:55,231
I,

6806
03:04:55,231 --> 03:04:55,761
I'd stopped.

6807
03:04:55,761 --> 03:04:56,060
Uh,

6808
03:04:56,060 --> 03:04:56,751
I read that book,

6809
03:04:56,751 --> 03:04:57,820
the plant paradox and I,

6810
03:04:57,980 --> 03:04:58,940
I've told this before,

6811
03:04:58,941 --> 03:05:02,690
but I stopped eating bread and those
whole wheat things and all the things he

6812
03:05:02,691 --> 03:05:03,141
talks about.

6813
03:05:03,141 --> 03:05:03,380
He,

6814
03:05:03,380 --> 03:05:03,651
he,

6815
03:05:03,651 --> 03:05:05,210
he's more of about plant based Guy,

6816
03:05:05,211 --> 03:05:09,740
but it did cure my plaque psoriasis up
until yesterday cause I started eating

6817
03:05:09,741 --> 03:05:10,370
right again.

6818
03:05:10,370 --> 03:05:11,840
But it cures Siva pitch,

6819
03:05:12,020 --> 03:05:14,660
cured my plaque psoriasis
and got rid of it.

6820
03:05:14,810 --> 03:05:16,910
It's that and be all,

6821
03:05:16,911 --> 03:05:17,744
but it's just,

6822
03:05:17,750 --> 03:05:19,790
it works for me depending on what you eat,

6823
03:05:20,350 --> 03:05:21,830
fuck what diet you do.

6824
03:05:21,860 --> 03:05:23,240
That's what is what works.

6825
03:05:23,870 --> 03:05:24,081
Yeah.

6826
03:05:24,081 --> 03:05:26,780
I'm eating real low carb or Kido.

6827
03:05:26,830 --> 03:05:27,350
Yes.

6828
03:05:27,350 --> 03:05:28,190
That's all it is.

6829
03:05:28,370 --> 03:05:30,650
It's either I'm Quito or
every now and then I'll,

6830
03:05:30,651 --> 03:05:31,281
I'll definitely,

6831
03:05:31,281 --> 03:05:32,870
I'll feel it when I get off of it.

6832
03:05:32,960 --> 03:05:33,793
What do you mean?

6833
03:05:33,990 --> 03:05:34,823
That shovels?

6834
03:05:34,840 --> 03:05:35,330
Yeah,

6835
03:05:35,330 --> 03:05:38,660
a lot of vegetables but low carbon
terms of no refined bullshit,

6836
03:05:38,990 --> 03:05:40,590
no flour.

6837
03:05:40,630 --> 03:05:42,560
And when I get into those states,

6838
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:44,000
I know when I'm have,

6839
03:05:44,001 --> 03:05:47,450
when I have too much fruit because
then I'll start craving it.

6840
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:49,550
I'll start like craving carbs,

6841
03:05:49,670 --> 03:05:51,440
whereas I can tell,

6842
03:05:51,441 --> 03:05:53,240
I mean I have tested myself a few times,

6843
03:05:53,241 --> 03:05:57,080
but it's annoying to stick that fucking
thing in your hand and extract the blood

6844
03:05:57,081 --> 03:05:58,120
and put it on the tab.

6845
03:05:58,440 --> 03:06:00,840
But you can feel when you're
in that state of Ketosis,

6846
03:06:00,841 --> 03:06:03,200
like I'll monitor my diet
real steady for five,

6847
03:06:03,201 --> 03:06:07,700
six days and sometimes it'll be like a
little dip because I've done it so many

6848
03:06:07,701 --> 03:06:07,970
times.

6849
03:06:07,970 --> 03:06:08,810
It's not as noticeable.

6850
03:06:08,811 --> 03:06:11,180
It'd be a little dip and your
energy during your workouts.

6851
03:06:11,360 --> 03:06:12,800
But then when I come on
the other side of it,

6852
03:06:12,830 --> 03:06:17,600
then as soon as I feel like no
hunger pangs during the day at all,

6853
03:06:17,690 --> 03:06:18,560
like I'm good.

6854
03:06:18,860 --> 03:06:19,340
And then I went,

6855
03:06:19,340 --> 03:06:19,640
oh,

6856
03:06:19,640 --> 03:06:19,911
okay,

6857
03:06:19,911 --> 03:06:20,390
I'm in,

6858
03:06:20,390 --> 03:06:20,871
I feel.

6859
03:06:20,871 --> 03:06:21,704
And then Gigi,

6860
03:06:21,830 --> 03:06:22,910
can you eat sweet potatoes?

6861
03:06:23,390 --> 03:06:25,250
You can but you can't eat too much.

6862
03:06:25,520 --> 03:06:28,790
Like sweet potato has
a lot of fiber in it.

6863
03:06:28,820 --> 03:06:32,600
It's one of the reasons why it's one
of the better potatoes for you to eat.

6864
03:06:32,601 --> 03:06:36,830
It's got a lot of vitamins and yams and
sweet potatoes are fantastic for you.

6865
03:06:36,850 --> 03:06:37,250
Yeah,

6866
03:06:37,250 --> 03:06:39,670
but it's like how much of
your are you taking it?

6867
03:06:39,671 --> 03:06:41,450
And how much actual sugar does your body,

6868
03:06:41,451 --> 03:06:42,350
you have to process.

6869
03:06:42,470 --> 03:06:43,850
It was just a small portion of it.

6870
03:06:44,180 --> 03:06:48,410
I'm sure it's fine if your overall meals
are filled with like really healthy

6871
03:06:48,411 --> 03:06:48,861
food,

6872
03:06:48,861 --> 03:06:50,000
Avocados,

6873
03:06:50,420 --> 03:06:51,740
healthy fats,

6874
03:06:51,990 --> 03:06:52,460
you know,

6875
03:06:52,460 --> 03:06:55,770
good solid protein with
no bullshit and no wheat.

6876
03:06:55,830 --> 03:06:56,130
Like

6877
03:06:56,130 --> 03:06:57,630
just keep the fuck away from wheat,

6878
03:06:57,840 --> 03:07:01,290
keep the fuck away from pasta or don't
you know every now and then have it.

6879
03:07:01,620 --> 03:07:05,310
But if you could just get your most
of your diet free of that Shit,

6880
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:06,390
you'll just feel better.

6881
03:07:06,590 --> 03:07:10,260
It just feel better because you ate too
many mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes

6882
03:07:10,440 --> 03:07:11,273
and got to,

6883
03:07:11,490 --> 03:07:12,990
you got to out of Ketosis.

6884
03:07:13,740 --> 03:07:15,450
As long as you're not eating a bullshit.

6885
03:07:15,630 --> 03:07:16,890
I don't even think that's bad.

6886
03:07:17,390 --> 03:07:17,611
I mean,

6887
03:07:17,611 --> 03:07:19,740
maybe your body will have
more of an insulin response,

6888
03:07:20,400 --> 03:07:22,770
but I mean you're having all
that fiber with your sugar.

6889
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:25,890
If you're eating a yam or a
mashed potato or a sweet potato,

6890
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:26,640
it's not,

6891
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:28,620
it's not like eating candy.

6892
03:07:28,660 --> 03:07:30,690
A lot of it's depends
on your activity level,

6893
03:07:30,691 --> 03:07:32,280
your show.

6894
03:07:32,281 --> 03:07:33,114
Yeah.

6895
03:07:33,210 --> 03:07:34,400
That's a big one factor.

6896
03:07:34,440 --> 03:07:36,630
That's a big one as post workout.

6897
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:40,710
Like how many people work out like
you did when you were fighting?

6898
03:07:40,740 --> 03:07:45,300
How many fucking human beings know what
it's like to put in those hard two a

6899
03:07:45,301 --> 03:07:49,140
days and just be almost no one
fried four weeks into camp?

6900
03:07:49,141 --> 03:07:52,260
Realize you've got two
to go and speak to it,

6901
03:07:52,261 --> 03:07:52,621
man.

6902
03:07:52,621 --> 03:07:53,454
Speak to,

6903
03:07:54,660 --> 03:07:55,141
there's nothing.

6904
03:07:55,141 --> 03:07:55,951
Where's you're nauseous.

6905
03:07:55,951 --> 03:07:58,750
Speak to them in the my
coach Tony Jeffrey to you,

6906
03:07:58,760 --> 03:07:59,371
he gets it.

6907
03:07:59,371 --> 03:08:01,710
He was an Olympic boxer
and bucks a professional.

6908
03:08:01,830 --> 03:08:02,640
He'd go,

6909
03:08:02,640 --> 03:08:02,821
yeah,

6910
03:08:02,821 --> 03:08:04,020
you're three weeks in you.

6911
03:08:04,021 --> 03:08:05,670
You have four more weeks of this Brendan,

6912
03:08:05,850 --> 03:08:08,020
let's get to work this fucking me.

6913
03:08:08,190 --> 03:08:09,023
Oh my God.

6914
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:13,440
That's why a guy like you has to like
keep an eye on is an appetite after you

6915
03:08:13,441 --> 03:08:14,370
get out of fighting.

6916
03:08:14,390 --> 03:08:14,820
Yes,

6917
03:08:14,820 --> 03:08:17,760
because you're not broken down like that
all day anymore where you could just

6918
03:08:17,761 --> 03:08:20,700
fuck and shovel it in people.

6919
03:08:20,701 --> 03:08:21,360
Let her have fun.

6920
03:08:21,360 --> 03:08:21,631
Any,

6921
03:08:21,631 --> 03:08:25,140
anytime you're doing anything that's
super difficult and you're working out

6922
03:08:25,141 --> 03:08:26,220
twice in a day,

6923
03:08:26,610 --> 03:08:26,821
man,

6924
03:08:26,821 --> 03:08:31,821
you're going to be hungry all the time
and your body gets into that space

6925
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:35,460
because even back then I wish I was more
knowledgeable on diet and stuff like

6926
03:08:35,461 --> 03:08:35,730
that.

6927
03:08:35,730 --> 03:08:38,820
I hired some nutritionist but it
never really clicked with anyone.

6928
03:08:39,060 --> 03:08:41,460
But I have more knowledge now on

6929
03:08:43,170 --> 03:08:45,170
Oh Jesus Christ and all
syrup almost through.

6930
03:08:45,230 --> 03:08:46,170
I just threw up in my mouth.

6931
03:08:46,200 --> 03:08:47,010
It's all good though.

6932
03:08:47,010 --> 03:08:48,210
Back to the Taquito Diet.

6933
03:08:48,300 --> 03:08:48,811
So,

6934
03:08:48,811 --> 03:08:49,370
um,

6935
03:08:49,370 --> 03:08:50,390
I have more knowledge now.

6936
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:51,820
You say Taquito Diet.

6937
03:08:52,310 --> 03:08:52,760
Diet.

6938
03:08:52,760 --> 03:08:53,593
I'm fun.

6939
03:08:54,030 --> 03:08:55,390
I'm struggle city.

6940
03:08:55,820 --> 03:08:57,120
I just wrote in my mouth,

6941
03:08:57,150 --> 03:09:02,150
my breath smells like
fucking throw up anyways.

6942
03:09:02,450 --> 03:09:02,820
Um,

6943
03:09:02,820 --> 03:09:06,780
I wish I had more knowledge back then
when I was fighting on diet and stuff

6944
03:09:06,810 --> 03:09:07,550
cause I did it.

6945
03:09:07,550 --> 03:09:08,490
I've talked to people,

6946
03:09:08,491 --> 03:09:09,410
I try to figure it out and like,

6947
03:09:09,640 --> 03:09:10,620
you're burning so many calories,

6948
03:09:10,621 --> 03:09:11,401
eat whatever you want.

6949
03:09:11,401 --> 03:09:11,611
I'm like,

6950
03:09:11,611 --> 03:09:11,821
God,

6951
03:09:11,821 --> 03:09:13,290
I don't think that's the right answer.

6952
03:09:13,700 --> 03:09:16,710
When I played at University of
Colorado and I would ask nutrition.

6953
03:09:16,711 --> 03:09:17,040
I'm like,

6954
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:17,191
man,

6955
03:09:17,191 --> 03:09:19,350
I feel like this yogurt
you've given us some gated,

6956
03:09:19,351 --> 03:09:21,120
it has so much fucking
sugar that she goes,

6957
03:09:21,360 --> 03:09:22,020
you're fine.

6958
03:09:22,020 --> 03:09:23,010
You're going to burn it off.

6959
03:09:23,030 --> 03:09:23,300
I'm like,

6960
03:09:23,300 --> 03:09:23,910
I,

6961
03:09:23,910 --> 03:09:25,170
this doesn't seem right to me,

6962
03:09:25,171 --> 03:09:25,620
man.

6963
03:09:25,620 --> 03:09:25,830
Yes.

6964
03:09:25,830 --> 03:09:26,850
I look at everyone's bodies.

6965
03:09:26,851 --> 03:09:29,340
We look like shit that that is true,

6966
03:09:29,341 --> 03:09:30,760
but you,

6967
03:09:30,790 --> 03:09:34,890
you definitely have different requirements
than a person who doesn't do the kind

6968
03:09:34,891 --> 03:09:36,110
of working out that well.

6969
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:39,330
Your body will burn a certain amount
of sugar and a certain amount,

6970
03:09:39,331 --> 03:09:42,920
especially when it comes to fruits or
anything complex hundred percent but I get

6971
03:09:42,921 --> 03:09:44,270
it burn more than know it.

6972
03:09:44,360 --> 03:09:45,510
You're burning those calories.

6973
03:09:45,511 --> 03:09:48,660
You can put good fuel in
and still get calories.

6974
03:09:48,900 --> 03:09:51,270
You don't have to get it
from cheeseburgers and candy.

6975
03:09:51,271 --> 03:09:53,500
You can get it through high quality foods.

6976
03:09:53,530 --> 03:09:54,850
Even still bored.

6977
03:09:54,880 --> 03:09:57,370
I'm saying getting at is in terms
of like overall performance,

6978
03:09:57,371 --> 03:09:58,450
if you want to do it perfectly,

6979
03:09:58,451 --> 03:10:01,060
I don't know if Kido is the
way to go for like a fighter.

6980
03:10:01,330 --> 03:10:05,050
I think the the strains and requirements
in your body in terms of like the

6981
03:10:05,051 --> 03:10:07,570
amount of fuel your body needs to burn.

6982
03:10:07,780 --> 03:10:10,540
There's an argument that
especially for a lot of people,

6983
03:10:10,541 --> 03:10:11,231
not for everybody,

6984
03:10:11,231 --> 03:10:16,231
but for a lot of people
having more carbohydrates in
your diet then is required

6985
03:10:16,331 --> 03:10:19,690
to stay in a state of
Ketosis or did I talk to,

6986
03:10:20,290 --> 03:10:21,720
I want to say Lance Palmer.

6987
03:10:21,790 --> 03:10:22,930
I silence if I'm off on this.

6988
03:10:23,350 --> 03:10:27,130
Lance told me one of the fighters
have had on my show goes man,

6989
03:10:27,131 --> 03:10:30,250
for the last three or the
three weeks before my fight,

6990
03:10:30,370 --> 03:10:31,061
he has to make weight.

6991
03:10:31,061 --> 03:10:31,271
He goes,

6992
03:10:31,271 --> 03:10:33,070
I go Kido and I make you wait easily.

6993
03:10:33,071 --> 03:10:33,311
He goes,

6994
03:10:33,311 --> 03:10:34,150
I've never felt better.

6995
03:10:34,570 --> 03:10:34,901
Yeah,

6996
03:10:34,901 --> 03:10:38,230
Brian Caraway said that to
Brian Caraway or talked to him,

6997
03:10:38,231 --> 03:10:39,400
so I did that for me.

6998
03:10:39,460 --> 03:10:41,440
Might be Lance Palmer might be,

6999
03:10:41,500 --> 03:10:41,830
well,

7000
03:10:41,830 --> 03:10:42,370
you look,

7001
03:10:42,370 --> 03:10:44,310
everybody's body responds differently.

7002
03:10:44,340 --> 03:10:45,280
That's another problem.

7003
03:10:45,550 --> 03:10:46,080
Everybody's,

7004
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:47,110
her body responds,

7005
03:10:47,140 --> 03:10:48,020
responds differently.

7006
03:10:48,130 --> 03:10:50,290
[inaudible] people ask me that too.

7007
03:10:50,291 --> 03:10:51,011
This is what I do,

7008
03:10:51,011 --> 03:10:51,161
man.

7009
03:10:51,161 --> 03:10:51,830
I don't know if it's free.

7010
03:10:51,830 --> 03:10:53,440
This say for me when I'm on the road,

7011
03:10:53,590 --> 03:10:54,820
I can find Keto meals,

7012
03:10:55,120 --> 03:10:55,601
meals.

7013
03:10:55,601 --> 03:10:56,610
When I go to a steakhouse,

7014
03:10:56,650 --> 03:10:57,450
it's easy.

7015
03:10:57,450 --> 03:10:58,360
It's super easy for me.

7016
03:10:59,780 --> 03:11:00,370
Medicine.

7017
03:11:00,370 --> 03:11:00,820
I mean,

7018
03:11:00,820 --> 03:11:02,020
medicine is that way now.

7019
03:11:02,080 --> 03:11:02,411
Sure.

7020
03:11:02,411 --> 03:11:03,040
That's why they,

7021
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:05,890
they give you pointed targeted therapy.

7022
03:11:05,891 --> 03:11:07,330
They've got to see what your genome is.

7023
03:11:07,400 --> 03:11:10,090
I always bring up you and your mom
when you talk about Brazil nuts.

7024
03:11:10,120 --> 03:11:10,570
Okay.

7025
03:11:10,570 --> 03:11:11,970
Your mom can't eat Brazil nuts.

7026
03:11:12,700 --> 03:11:13,870
You could brush your skin with them.

7027
03:11:14,080 --> 03:11:14,681
It was crazy.

7028
03:11:14,681 --> 03:11:15,880
And she would break out.

7029
03:11:15,881 --> 03:11:16,240
Yeah.

7030
03:11:16,240 --> 03:11:18,130
That's fucking your
mommy's called those death.

7031
03:11:18,131 --> 03:11:20,800
I forget Brazil nuts is those.

7032
03:11:20,860 --> 03:11:25,860
She always calling out of all the things
to be allergic to the wackiest nut of

7033
03:11:26,231 --> 03:11:26,381
them.

7034
03:11:26,381 --> 03:11:28,750
All the shittiest tasting stupid.

7035
03:11:28,751 --> 03:11:31,510
Not like when you get one of
those things of mixed nuts,

7036
03:11:31,511 --> 03:11:32,560
you get those Brazil nuts,

7037
03:11:33,900 --> 03:11:34,180
nuts.

7038
03:11:34,180 --> 03:11:36,570
Throw that big slop.

7039
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:37,413
Toes.

7040
03:11:38,110 --> 03:11:38,440
Toes.

7041
03:11:38,440 --> 03:11:38,681
Yeah.

7042
03:11:38,681 --> 03:11:39,514
Am I?

7043
03:11:39,660 --> 03:11:39,850
Yeah,

7044
03:11:39,850 --> 03:11:40,570
they do.

7045
03:11:40,570 --> 03:11:40,661
Oh,

7046
03:11:40,661 --> 03:11:41,720
that's what she calls us.

7047
03:11:42,020 --> 03:11:43,570
Just so we call it something else.

7048
03:11:43,571 --> 03:11:44,261
Slot toes.

7049
03:11:44,261 --> 03:11:44,590
Right.

7050
03:11:44,590 --> 03:11:45,730
They look like slot though.

7051
03:11:45,970 --> 03:11:48,430
Maybe I just made that up now
if it is what it looks like,

7052
03:11:48,640 --> 03:11:49,473
I'm sick,

7053
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:51,250
but Brazil,

7054
03:11:51,250 --> 03:11:52,000
Brazil nuts.

7055
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:53,020
Like I,

7056
03:11:53,440 --> 03:11:55,270
I heard that they're good.

7057
03:11:55,330 --> 03:11:57,950
They good for sports and for
your liver or some bullshit.

7058
03:11:58,010 --> 03:12:02,080
But I do get all brides decides
to start chopping them up six,

7059
03:12:02,081 --> 03:12:02,950
seven at a time,

7060
03:12:02,951 --> 03:12:04,120
putting him in Mashiach.

7061
03:12:04,330 --> 03:12:08,230
That's all good problem is I
inherited a little of the old,

7062
03:12:08,610 --> 03:12:09,090
uh,

7063
03:12:09,090 --> 03:12:09,330
uh,

7064
03:12:09,330 --> 03:12:10,061
allergic stuff.

7065
03:12:10,061 --> 03:12:12,310
Now when you are allergic and
you keep eating something,

7066
03:12:12,340 --> 03:12:15,160
you'll develop more and more
of a reaction with less.

7067
03:12:15,700 --> 03:12:17,920
So I would notice that all of a sudden,

7068
03:12:17,921 --> 03:12:18,880
periodically I'd like,

7069
03:12:18,881 --> 03:12:20,740
my throat would be sore.

7070
03:12:20,741 --> 03:12:22,750
It just be swollen and sore.

7071
03:12:23,050 --> 03:12:23,561
And I was like,

7072
03:12:23,561 --> 03:12:24,550
what the fuck is going?

7073
03:12:24,551 --> 03:12:25,780
I'm not sick but my throat.

7074
03:12:26,080 --> 03:12:26,913
And then,

7075
03:12:27,280 --> 03:12:27,840
then,

7076
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:28,120
uh,

7077
03:12:28,120 --> 03:12:29,650
my entire mouth,

7078
03:12:29,690 --> 03:12:32,380
what one point swelled up and like,

7079
03:12:32,440 --> 03:12:35,290
it looked like my roof of my
mouth had been burned and I,

7080
03:12:35,291 --> 03:12:36,730
and my dentist goes,

7081
03:12:36,731 --> 03:12:39,250
did you burn the entire
roof of your mouth?

7082
03:12:39,251 --> 03:12:39,640
I went,

7083
03:12:39,640 --> 03:12:40,473
no.

7084
03:12:40,720 --> 03:12:41,553
And he goes,

7085
03:12:41,770 --> 03:12:42,640
your mouth,

7086
03:12:42,760 --> 03:12:44,320
it looks like it's been burned.

7087
03:12:44,350 --> 03:12:45,250
Like somebody stuck a thing.

7088
03:12:45,251 --> 03:12:45,491
And I go,

7089
03:12:45,491 --> 03:12:45,801
yeah,

7090
03:12:45,801 --> 03:12:46,030
it's,

7091
03:12:46,030 --> 03:12:46,990
it's killing me.

7092
03:12:46,991 --> 03:12:48,060
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

7093
03:12:48,080 --> 03:12:48,913
He goes,

7094
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:50,230
you're allergic to something.

7095
03:12:50,620 --> 03:12:50,990
I said,

7096
03:12:50,990 --> 03:12:51,201
no,

7097
03:12:51,201 --> 03:12:51,801
I'm not allergic.

7098
03:12:51,801 --> 03:12:52,520
He goes,

7099
03:12:52,520 --> 03:12:54,340
are you eating a nut that
you might be alerted to?

7100
03:12:54,470 --> 03:12:56,110
When I say ah,

7101
03:12:56,120 --> 03:12:58,910
and so I was developing
very quickly as a while ago.

7102
03:12:59,720 --> 03:13:00,620
That's insane.

7103
03:13:00,621 --> 03:13:01,190
Yeah.

7104
03:13:01,190 --> 03:13:05,990
Have you ever heard of the lone star
tick and that it gives people red meat

7105
03:13:05,991 --> 03:13:06,824
allergy?

7106
03:13:06,980 --> 03:13:07,610
I have.

7107
03:13:07,610 --> 03:13:11,270
I listened to a radio lab
and I'll figure it out.

7108
03:13:11,300 --> 03:13:11,700
Yeah,

7109
03:13:11,700 --> 03:13:12,320
yeah,

7110
03:13:12,320 --> 03:13:12,561
yeah.

7111
03:13:12,561 --> 03:13:13,100
There's some,

7112
03:13:13,100 --> 03:13:14,680
some fucking town.

7113
03:13:14,760 --> 03:13:15,540
Yeah.

7114
03:13:15,540 --> 03:13:17,750
The tick is becoming less and less rare.

7115
03:13:17,880 --> 03:13:19,070
That's what's really a tick borne.

7116
03:13:19,071 --> 03:13:20,480
Diseases are fucking horrifying.

7117
03:13:21,050 --> 03:13:23,560
There are so many people out there
that are suffering from chronic,

7118
03:13:24,190 --> 03:13:24,560
you know,

7119
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:25,310
they don't care.

7120
03:13:25,310 --> 03:13:26,330
They don't catch it quick enough.

7121
03:13:26,331 --> 03:13:28,460
They don't get the antibiotics
and their system quick enough.

7122
03:13:28,461 --> 03:13:29,570
And I know somebody who has that.

7123
03:13:29,960 --> 03:13:30,890
My friend Shandra,

7124
03:13:30,891 --> 03:13:35,120
her dad got a a shot for Lyme disease.

7125
03:13:35,121 --> 03:13:39,200
They used to give you a vaccination
and he caught Lyme disease from the

7126
03:13:39,201 --> 03:13:40,034
vaccination.

7127
03:13:40,610 --> 03:13:41,930
They don't do that vaccination.

7128
03:13:43,670 --> 03:13:44,720
Fuck man.

7129
03:13:45,800 --> 03:13:46,581
There's no way to cure it,

7130
03:13:46,581 --> 03:13:46,850
right?

7131
03:13:46,850 --> 03:13:47,271
Well,

7132
03:13:47,271 --> 03:13:50,350
they're just massive
amounts of tetracycline and,

7133
03:13:50,410 --> 03:13:52,460
but everybody's result is different.

7134
03:13:53,120 --> 03:13:56,210
Some people catch it too
late and it's like chronic.

7135
03:13:56,300 --> 03:13:58,100
Jimmy Burke had a tuberculosis.

7136
03:13:58,101 --> 03:13:59,190
We called him watching me.

7137
03:13:59,750 --> 03:14:00,471
She don't know about that.

7138
03:14:00,471 --> 03:14:01,304
When did he have that?

7139
03:14:01,730 --> 03:14:02,990
[inaudible] has got it.

7140
03:14:03,020 --> 03:14:06,140
They thought for six months he
or I was about three months.

7141
03:14:06,141 --> 03:14:10,140
They thought he had the disease that
killed Bernie Mac and they thought he had

7142
03:14:10,141 --> 03:14:10,240
that,

7143
03:14:10,240 --> 03:14:11,300
had that or lung cancer.

7144
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:12,980
And I'm with Jimmy,

7145
03:14:12,981 --> 03:14:15,470
he's walking around with a
machine that's training as lungs.

7146
03:14:15,620 --> 03:14:16,040
Okay.

7147
03:14:16,040 --> 03:14:17,000
They couldn't figure it out.

7148
03:14:17,660 --> 03:14:19,490
What does it hook up through his mouth?

7149
03:14:19,640 --> 03:14:20,390
Uh,

7150
03:14:20,390 --> 03:14:24,060
I think the thing to his chest says,

7151
03:14:24,140 --> 03:14:28,430
10 years ago I was walking
around in the hospital and uh,

7152
03:14:28,610 --> 03:14:30,040
and that was what he was looking at.

7153
03:14:30,060 --> 03:14:31,820
So I fly to New York
because my fucking brother,

7154
03:14:31,821 --> 03:14:32,030
right?

7155
03:14:32,030 --> 03:14:32,661
I fly them in New York.

7156
03:14:32,661 --> 03:14:32,961
I'm like,

7157
03:14:32,961 --> 03:14:33,770
dude,

7158
03:14:33,770 --> 03:14:34,161
I go,

7159
03:14:34,161 --> 03:14:34,461
you know,

7160
03:14:34,461 --> 03:14:34,940
you have other,

7161
03:14:34,940 --> 03:14:35,480
have the,

7162
03:14:35,480 --> 03:14:40,040
the thing that turns your lungs
to sand or two or lung cancer.

7163
03:14:40,370 --> 03:14:40,910
And he goes,

7164
03:14:40,910 --> 03:14:41,930
that's what they're telling me about.

7165
03:14:42,590 --> 03:14:44,480
And we're talking and
he's hanging out with him.

7166
03:14:44,481 --> 03:14:45,080
And I go,

7167
03:14:45,080 --> 03:14:49,100
how the fuck are you
not in crisis right now?

7168
03:14:49,370 --> 03:14:49,851
And he goes,

7169
03:14:49,851 --> 03:14:50,480
dude,

7170
03:14:50,480 --> 03:14:51,313
I made,

7171
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:55,970
I made peace with my death so fucking
long ago that if I'm going to go like

7172
03:14:55,971 --> 03:14:56,750
this,

7173
03:14:56,750 --> 03:15:00,890
everybody's laughing and my
funeral better be a fucking party.

7174
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:02,301
Anyway,

7175
03:15:02,301 --> 03:15:03,200
long story short,

7176
03:15:03,540 --> 03:15:04,780
they come in and they've,

7177
03:15:04,810 --> 03:15:05,810
they've of course guests,

7178
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:06,860
guests who falls in love with him.

7179
03:15:06,920 --> 03:15:08,750
All the doctors cause this Jimmy Burke,

7180
03:15:09,050 --> 03:15:09,380
alright.

7181
03:15:09,380 --> 03:15:12,230
All the fucking doctors
and they fall over them.

7182
03:15:12,260 --> 03:15:15,920
And when they found out that he had
tuberculosis on the outside of Islam,

7183
03:15:16,040 --> 03:15:17,060
it wasn't on the inside,

7184
03:15:17,120 --> 03:15:18,230
which was really weird.

7185
03:15:18,470 --> 03:15:19,281
He had on the outside,

7186
03:15:19,281 --> 03:15:22,520
got it from probably from his grandfather
who he hadn't been exposed to when he

7187
03:15:22,521 --> 03:15:23,091
was three,

7188
03:15:23,091 --> 03:15:23,924
four years old.

7189
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:24,440
Whoa.

7190
03:15:24,440 --> 03:15:25,010
When honest.

7191
03:15:25,010 --> 03:15:25,310
Yeah.

7192
03:15:25,310 --> 03:15:25,791
When he was,

7193
03:15:25,791 --> 03:15:27,470
when he was done at do for tuberculosis.

7194
03:15:27,471 --> 03:15:28,910
So with tuberculosis,

7195
03:15:29,210 --> 03:15:34,210
they give you nine months of antibiotics
and what that did to Jimmy of who,

7196
03:15:35,480 --> 03:15:37,730
what that did to Jimmy is itchy asshole.

7197
03:15:38,350 --> 03:15:38,541
No,

7198
03:15:38,541 --> 03:15:39,201
not just that.

7199
03:15:39,201 --> 03:15:40,430
It made him colorblind.

7200
03:15:40,820 --> 03:15:42,410
So he can't see certain colors.

7201
03:15:42,470 --> 03:15:43,500
Oh yeah,

7202
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:44,270
the antibiotic.

7203
03:15:44,270 --> 03:15:44,840
Yeah.

7204
03:15:44,840 --> 03:15:45,860
Nobody healthier by the way.

7205
03:15:45,861 --> 03:15:47,180
But he went through some shit.

7206
03:15:47,300 --> 03:15:48,760
The way he handled that was amazing.

7207
03:15:48,761 --> 03:15:49,260
This.

7208
03:15:49,260 --> 03:15:50,280
He's still colorblind.

7209
03:15:50,640 --> 03:15:51,210
Oh yeah,

7210
03:15:51,210 --> 03:15:52,740
it it from antibiotic.

7211
03:15:52,780 --> 03:15:53,580
Yes sir.

7212
03:15:53,580 --> 03:15:54,570
It changed his,

7213
03:15:54,750 --> 03:15:56,010
changed his body a little bit too.

7214
03:15:56,011 --> 03:15:57,030
He wasn't as muscular.

7215
03:15:57,031 --> 03:15:58,170
I think he lost some weight bro.

7216
03:15:58,190 --> 03:15:59,310
You ever take antibiotics?

7217
03:15:59,311 --> 03:15:59,961
Make you asshole?

7218
03:15:59,961 --> 03:16:01,500
Which like the ring of your athletes,

7219
03:16:01,501 --> 03:16:02,080
you know?

7220
03:16:02,080 --> 03:16:02,760
Oh,

7221
03:16:02,760 --> 03:16:03,400
I want to take off.

7222
03:16:03,400 --> 03:16:05,640
It doesn't make the
ring of my asshole itch.

7223
03:16:06,480 --> 03:16:07,470
It's one of the,

7224
03:16:07,471 --> 03:16:10,230
it's one of the side effects
not to brick TB like that,

7225
03:16:10,231 --> 03:16:13,140
that that fucking not
nine months where he was,

7226
03:16:13,200 --> 03:16:13,770
dude,

7227
03:16:13,770 --> 03:16:14,850
he was on the staff.

7228
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,160
I've got staff once and I remember,

7229
03:16:17,480 --> 03:16:17,991
I remember that,

7230
03:16:17,991 --> 03:16:21,990
but I got it once and I took the
antibiotics and we went out to dinner.

7231
03:16:21,991 --> 03:16:25,230
You and me and Patty Jenkins and you
couldn't drink and not only could I not

7232
03:16:25,231 --> 03:16:26,010
drink,

7233
03:16:26,010 --> 03:16:30,480
my head felt like I had like a
led helmet sitting on my head.

7234
03:16:30,481 --> 03:16:31,170
I was like,

7235
03:16:31,170 --> 03:16:31,680
I was like,

7236
03:16:31,680 --> 03:16:33,360
I can't believe how shitty I feel.

7237
03:16:33,360 --> 03:16:36,570
I feel so weak and so shitty
and I just gotten on him.

7238
03:16:36,571 --> 03:16:40,200
I was only on him for a couple of
days and I remember thinking like,

7239
03:16:40,201 --> 03:16:40,441
wow,

7240
03:16:40,441 --> 03:16:42,120
how could anybody fight on that?

7241
03:16:42,210 --> 03:16:43,230
How about guys fight with them?

7242
03:16:43,650 --> 03:16:44,910
They're crazy.

7243
03:16:44,940 --> 03:16:47,300
It drains you so bad.

7244
03:16:47,610 --> 03:16:49,770
I didn't train obviously
because I had staff.

7245
03:16:49,771 --> 03:16:50,670
I didn't want to give it to anybody,

7246
03:16:50,671 --> 03:16:53,360
but I did try to use some
weights and do some working out.

7247
03:16:53,370 --> 03:16:54,210
It was useless.

7248
03:16:54,211 --> 03:16:55,170
I'll try to hit the bag.

7249
03:16:55,270 --> 03:16:56,420
Use Lists.

7250
03:16:56,440 --> 03:16:57,081
That's what's crazy.

7251
03:16:57,081 --> 03:16:58,760
When you find those slides like yeah,

7252
03:16:58,800 --> 03:17:00,660
he won that fight and he was
on the antibiotic choice.

7253
03:17:00,880 --> 03:17:01,300
Yeah.

7254
03:17:01,300 --> 03:17:02,810
Fuck fucking Kevin Lee,

7255
03:17:03,180 --> 03:17:03,900
when he fought,

7256
03:17:03,900 --> 03:17:07,080
when he fought against Tony Ferguson
and I looked at his chest the moment he

7257
03:17:07,081 --> 03:17:08,130
walked into the cage and they're like,

7258
03:17:08,131 --> 03:17:11,660
that it staff or you can see it's Boucher.

7259
03:17:11,780 --> 03:17:12,613
DDF staff.

7260
03:17:12,950 --> 03:17:14,460
He was on antibiotics.

7261
03:17:14,490 --> 03:17:15,271
No way,

7262
03:17:15,271 --> 03:17:16,680
cause I didn't come here to tap.

7263
03:17:16,890 --> 03:17:18,630
That's sluggish.

7264
03:17:18,631 --> 03:17:18,941
She's like,

7265
03:17:18,941 --> 03:17:19,021
Oh,

7266
03:17:19,021 --> 03:17:20,790
I was on antibiotics the whole time.

7267
03:17:20,910 --> 03:17:21,690
That's insane.

7268
03:17:21,690 --> 03:17:23,880
You could see Shasha on antibiotics.

7269
03:17:24,150 --> 03:17:24,720
Holy.

7270
03:17:24,720 --> 03:17:26,980
She could see the Kevin Lee had a staff,

7271
03:17:26,981 --> 03:17:28,730
hundred percent extra.

7272
03:17:28,731 --> 03:17:29,790
He had his,

7273
03:17:29,930 --> 03:17:33,780
he had a giant Welt on his chest
and I pointed it out to Daniel.

7274
03:17:34,380 --> 03:17:36,720
I pointed out like it wasn't
look like staffing supplier is.

7275
03:17:36,721 --> 03:17:38,760
Someone in in Daniel's ears were saying,

7276
03:17:38,790 --> 03:17:39,870
do not talk about it,

7277
03:17:39,900 --> 03:17:40,740
do not talk about it.

7278
03:17:40,741 --> 03:17:41,550
And he's like,

7279
03:17:41,550 --> 03:17:41,821
yeah,

7280
03:17:41,821 --> 03:17:42,930
that looks like staff to me.

7281
03:17:43,740 --> 03:17:44,580
Right when you said it,

7282
03:17:44,581 --> 03:17:44,881
I was like,

7283
03:17:44,881 --> 03:17:45,511
Oh shit.

7284
03:17:45,511 --> 03:17:46,770
I hope Joe's right man.

7285
03:17:46,860 --> 03:17:47,461
Oh No,

7286
03:17:47,461 --> 03:17:48,210
I'm right.

7287
03:17:48,210 --> 03:17:48,750
Oh,

7288
03:17:48,750 --> 03:17:49,920
there's no way that could be anything.

7289
03:17:50,450 --> 03:17:53,970
It was swollen like
something either happened,

7290
03:17:53,971 --> 03:17:55,200
like maybe he got burnt callbacks,

7291
03:17:55,230 --> 03:17:56,130
states check can,

7292
03:17:56,131 --> 03:17:56,941
I haven't heard anything.

7293
03:17:56,941 --> 03:17:58,560
You think you'd be taking a break?

7294
03:17:58,590 --> 03:18:01,780
You know the drawing board is coach comen.

7295
03:18:01,820 --> 03:18:02,670
How's Robert Falls?

7296
03:18:02,671 --> 03:18:03,170
Yeah,

7297
03:18:03,170 --> 03:18:04,003
it was his coach.

7298
03:18:04,020 --> 03:18:04,890
That's a bummer.

7299
03:18:04,920 --> 03:18:06,720
Robert Falls is a great guy.

7300
03:18:07,440 --> 03:18:09,090
I didn't know he committed suicide up yet.

7301
03:18:09,210 --> 03:18:10,170
I knew that he died.

7302
03:18:10,460 --> 03:18:10,671
I was,

7303
03:18:10,671 --> 03:18:10,920
wait,

7304
03:18:10,920 --> 03:18:12,660
I heard that there had
been a rumor about that,

7305
03:18:12,661 --> 03:18:14,190
but it wasn't about her suicide.

7306
03:18:14,370 --> 03:18:15,960
This brother committed suicide as well.

7307
03:18:16,210 --> 03:18:16,540
Uh,

7308
03:18:16,540 --> 03:18:16,920
yes.

7309
03:18:16,920 --> 03:18:17,820
Fuck.

7310
03:18:18,210 --> 03:18:19,170
They're poor parents.

7311
03:18:21,180 --> 03:18:22,290
He was a really,

7312
03:18:22,291 --> 03:18:23,280
really nice guy.

7313
03:18:23,930 --> 03:18:25,200
Very smart guy too.

7314
03:18:25,260 --> 03:18:26,340
Very smart guy.

7315
03:18:26,460 --> 03:18:27,600
That's such a bummer man.

7316
03:18:28,530 --> 03:18:29,040
You know,

7317
03:18:29,040 --> 03:18:32,130
and who knows what,

7318
03:18:32,160 --> 03:18:35,300
what causes someone who is
so well loved and so liked.

7319
03:18:35,750 --> 03:18:35,981
You know,

7320
03:18:35,981 --> 03:18:36,210
that's,

7321
03:18:36,210 --> 03:18:41,210
that's a great argument for like
chemical issues versus like a,

7322
03:18:41,810 --> 03:18:44,490
I mean you could tell some people
just don't have good lives.

7323
03:18:44,910 --> 03:18:46,170
Everything's going bad for them.

7324
03:18:46,171 --> 03:18:48,310
They want to end their life
cause they can't take the pain.

7325
03:18:48,460 --> 03:18:51,190
But then there's other people that are
like him that are doing really well,

7326
03:18:51,640 --> 03:18:51,911
you know,

7327
03:18:51,911 --> 03:18:52,451
and you got to go,

7328
03:18:52,451 --> 03:18:52,781
man,

7329
03:18:52,781 --> 03:18:55,610
what is straight man to fuck
it dude is a fucking issue.

7330
03:18:55,870 --> 03:18:56,290
And we have,

7331
03:18:56,290 --> 03:19:00,760
we all have this real problem when it
comes to people doing things that we would

7332
03:19:00,761 --> 03:19:01,540
think would,

7333
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:02,373
you know,

7334
03:19:02,380 --> 03:19:07,030
you'd consider to be something that
someone who doesn't have control of

7335
03:19:07,031 --> 03:19:07,840
themselves does.

7336
03:19:07,840 --> 03:19:09,010
And we shun that.

7337
03:19:09,011 --> 03:19:09,341
We won't,

7338
03:19:09,341 --> 03:19:10,780
we don't like that it bothers us,

7339
03:19:11,200 --> 03:19:16,200
but there's a reality to like pain
and suffering that we have to address.

7340
03:19:17,680 --> 03:19:18,460
And you know,

7341
03:19:18,460 --> 03:19:21,880
shaming someone for wanting to
end their life is not sound.

7342
03:19:22,170 --> 03:19:22,750
You know,

7343
03:19:22,750 --> 03:19:25,390
until you've been faced
with that kind of despair,

7344
03:19:25,600 --> 03:19:26,890
if you're that,

7345
03:19:26,950 --> 03:19:30,880
that if the juror despair level is to
the point where you take your own life,

7346
03:19:31,090 --> 03:19:35,260
you have my utmost and
everlasting sympathy.

7347
03:19:35,500 --> 03:19:37,060
I don't have a judgment on that.

7348
03:19:37,240 --> 03:19:38,260
I'd never been there.

7349
03:19:38,261 --> 03:19:39,840
So the idea that I'd be a core,

7350
03:19:39,890 --> 03:19:40,570
get it,

7351
03:19:40,570 --> 03:19:41,500
get it together,

7352
03:19:41,800 --> 03:19:46,090
usually had a rational decision for
someone who's just commit suicide is the

7353
03:19:46,091 --> 03:19:49,360
only way out of this
terrible situation is death.

7354
03:19:49,390 --> 03:19:50,950
That's a rational decision.

7355
03:19:51,250 --> 03:19:51,521
I,

7356
03:19:51,521 --> 03:19:52,000
I have,

7357
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:53,980
I have nothing but my ultimate,

7358
03:19:55,150 --> 03:19:57,430
all you can do is shake
your head and feel sad.

7359
03:19:57,960 --> 03:19:58,690
That's judgmental.

7360
03:19:58,690 --> 03:20:00,220
It's fucking completely horrible.

7361
03:20:00,250 --> 03:20:00,491
I mean,

7362
03:20:00,491 --> 03:20:03,760
when you stop and think about the
idea of wanting to end your life,

7363
03:20:03,810 --> 03:20:04,031
you know,

7364
03:20:04,031 --> 03:20:04,781
I feel lucky,

7365
03:20:04,781 --> 03:20:05,840
I don't call it that,

7366
03:20:06,310 --> 03:20:08,860
that level of Serotonin in my brain,

7367
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:10,391
but I think it,

7368
03:20:10,391 --> 03:20:10,990
again,

7369
03:20:10,990 --> 03:20:13,600
I think for a lot of
people it goes back to,

7370
03:20:14,270 --> 03:20:14,650
you know,

7371
03:20:14,650 --> 03:20:15,151
what,

7372
03:20:15,151 --> 03:20:15,880
what's the chem,

7373
03:20:15,880 --> 03:20:18,610
what's the chemical reaction
that's going on in your brain?

7374
03:20:18,611 --> 03:20:19,200
What they've done?

7375
03:20:19,200 --> 03:20:19,670
Is it,

7376
03:20:19,670 --> 03:20:19,990
uh,

7377
03:20:19,990 --> 03:20:20,291
you know,

7378
03:20:20,291 --> 03:20:20,411
it,

7379
03:20:20,411 --> 03:20:20,630
is it,

7380
03:20:20,630 --> 03:20:21,800
is it just an,

7381
03:20:21,860 --> 03:20:25,060
an issue with some sort of a disorder
where there's like something that's not

7382
03:20:25,061 --> 03:20:29,200
producing the right amount of chemicals
or is it a problem of your past?

7383
03:20:29,230 --> 03:20:31,000
Like it trauma,

7384
03:20:31,001 --> 03:20:31,780
inflation of dot.

7385
03:20:31,780 --> 03:20:32,620
A lot of different factors.

7386
03:20:32,621 --> 03:20:36,810
But one thing they know is that you
have a set point for your serotonin.

7387
03:20:36,820 --> 03:20:37,211
And usually,

7388
03:20:37,211 --> 03:20:37,421
you know,

7389
03:20:37,421 --> 03:20:39,550
like certain people like me,

7390
03:20:39,551 --> 03:20:44,440
I probably have a serotonin level from
one to 10 at usually seven to eight,

7391
03:20:44,470 --> 03:20:44,771
you know,

7392
03:20:44,771 --> 03:20:45,910
no matter what's going on,

7393
03:20:45,911 --> 03:20:46,960
I'm always,

7394
03:20:47,320 --> 03:20:48,280
I'm just lucky.

7395
03:20:48,310 --> 03:20:50,560
I just very rarely get depressed.

7396
03:20:50,561 --> 03:20:51,394
And if I do,

7397
03:20:51,490 --> 03:20:53,740
it's a mild sort of haze.

7398
03:20:54,340 --> 03:20:55,660
Some people they could,

7399
03:20:55,780 --> 03:20:58,270
they could invent the
cure for every disease.

7400
03:20:58,271 --> 03:21:00,820
In the world and win the
lottery and all this stuff.

7401
03:21:01,440 --> 03:21:04,900
They just go back to their serotonin
levels being at four or whatever,

7402
03:21:04,901 --> 03:21:05,591
and it's just,

7403
03:21:05,591 --> 03:21:06,040
yeah,

7404
03:21:06,040 --> 03:21:07,600
I think it's a little bit
more complicated than that,

7405
03:21:07,601 --> 03:21:09,070
but I think there's a,

7406
03:21:09,190 --> 03:21:09,401
yeah,

7407
03:21:09,401 --> 03:21:11,740
there's some people that are just
never happy for whatever reason,

7408
03:21:11,741 --> 03:21:12,311
whatever reason,

7409
03:21:12,311 --> 03:21:17,311
chemically or whether it can be eight
in the apprentices does always that.

7410
03:21:18,431 --> 03:21:20,230
Neil's always like,

7411
03:21:20,240 --> 03:21:22,120
as always been melancholy.

7412
03:21:22,450 --> 03:21:27,340
He's always been sort of in that blue
region and I've always been so brilliant,

7413
03:21:27,850 --> 03:21:28,340
Neil Brennan,

7414
03:21:28,340 --> 03:21:29,740
so when you hear him talking about it,

7415
03:21:29,741 --> 03:21:30,371
like he was like,

7416
03:21:30,371 --> 03:21:30,491
yeah,

7417
03:21:30,491 --> 03:21:32,180
with the Chappelle stuff and he's like,

7418
03:21:32,181 --> 03:21:32,331
Yo man,

7419
03:21:32,331 --> 03:21:33,030
it was just here.

7420
03:21:33,030 --> 03:21:33,410
Myths,

7421
03:21:33,410 --> 03:21:34,090
chef,

7422
03:21:34,090 --> 03:21:34,630
medication.

7423
03:21:34,630 --> 03:21:35,141
I'm just here.

7424
03:21:35,141 --> 03:21:36,430
I just go through the motions.

7425
03:21:36,490 --> 03:21:37,660
He's a very smart guy.

7426
03:21:37,680 --> 03:21:38,280
Oh my God,

7427
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:39,113
he's brilliant.

7428
03:21:39,400 --> 03:21:42,220
I think there's an also an issue
with people that are really smart.

7429
03:21:42,250 --> 03:21:43,630
They look at the futility of it all.

7430
03:21:44,260 --> 03:21:47,100
It's sometimes harder for
them to overcome this,

7431
03:21:47,120 --> 03:21:47,953
game it off.

7432
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:49,281
He goes,

7433
03:21:49,281 --> 03:21:49,790
he goes,

7434
03:21:49,790 --> 03:21:50,091
he,

7435
03:21:50,091 --> 03:21:51,260
he'd suffer from depression.

7436
03:21:51,570 --> 03:21:52,220
Are you doing?

7437
03:21:52,220 --> 03:21:52,431
Yeah,

7438
03:21:52,431 --> 03:21:53,930
he wouldn't call me about where you been.

7439
03:21:53,931 --> 03:21:54,550
He goes,

7440
03:21:54,550 --> 03:21:54,950
Eh,

7441
03:21:54,950 --> 03:21:55,160
you know,

7442
03:21:55,160 --> 03:21:56,720
I got to touch the black dog.

7443
03:21:56,990 --> 03:21:57,531
And I'm like,

7444
03:21:57,531 --> 03:21:58,364
yeah,

7445
03:21:59,090 --> 03:22:02,330
cause you ever want to like kill somebody,

7446
03:22:02,420 --> 03:22:05,030
but you can't get yourself off the couch.

7447
03:22:06,100 --> 03:22:07,010
It's like you to depress.

7448
03:22:07,020 --> 03:22:07,770
You don't have to guess.

7449
03:22:07,770 --> 03:22:08,030
It's,

7450
03:22:08,030 --> 03:22:08,281
it's,

7451
03:22:08,281 --> 03:22:10,040
it's like some people have a real thing.

7452
03:22:11,360 --> 03:22:12,250
There's overwhelming,

7453
03:22:12,260 --> 03:22:13,280
there's no denying.

7454
03:22:13,400 --> 03:22:14,060
It's like,

7455
03:22:14,060 --> 03:22:15,620
but how much can exercise help you?

7456
03:22:15,621 --> 03:22:16,850
How much can dine help you?

7457
03:22:17,050 --> 03:22:17,420
It's,

7458
03:22:17,420 --> 03:22:18,260
it's a factor.

7459
03:22:18,261 --> 03:22:19,310
It's not the only factor,

7460
03:22:19,311 --> 03:22:20,210
but it's a factor.

7461
03:22:20,480 --> 03:22:20,900
You know?

7462
03:22:20,900 --> 03:22:24,330
And there's a lot of people that don't
realize that and they go through life and

7463
03:22:24,480 --> 03:22:25,191
they have these issues.

7464
03:22:25,191 --> 03:22:27,830
And then there's people that have
all the exercise and the Diet right.

7465
03:22:27,831 --> 03:22:28,940
And they still depressed,

7466
03:22:29,530 --> 03:22:30,410
still not the answer.

7467
03:22:30,920 --> 03:22:32,390
Like they have so much going for him.

7468
03:22:33,140 --> 03:22:34,130
And then there's head trauma.

7469
03:22:34,370 --> 03:22:34,820
You know,

7470
03:22:34,820 --> 03:22:36,620
there's always going to be a factor.

7471
03:22:36,800 --> 03:22:41,750
There's a Tbi and CTE and
all the different things
that that does to your head.

7472
03:22:42,410 --> 03:22:43,370
There's no doubt about that.

7473
03:22:43,700 --> 03:22:47,300
Chris Cornell Cause Chris
Cornell had such an artistic,

7474
03:22:47,360 --> 03:22:48,080
um,

7475
03:22:48,080 --> 03:22:49,400
fully artistic,

7476
03:22:49,450 --> 03:22:54,170
such an he accomplished so
much artistically and had
a con is his art artistry

7477
03:22:54,200 --> 03:22:58,340
was continuing to flourish and kind of
in the middle of that with children and

7478
03:22:58,341 --> 03:23:00,970
so much to live for
antianxiety medication.

7479
03:23:01,280 --> 03:23:01,700
No,

7480
03:23:01,700 --> 03:23:02,390
he calls taking.

7481
03:23:02,390 --> 03:23:02,601
Yeah.

7482
03:23:02,601 --> 03:23:05,840
He called his wife up before he did
it and he was slurring his words.

7483
03:23:06,140 --> 03:23:08,000
They think he was on a lot of that stuff.

7484
03:23:08,270 --> 03:23:10,280
How about the Lincoln Park?

7485
03:23:11,480 --> 03:23:12,950
He had seven kids.

7486
03:23:13,340 --> 03:23:15,230
That stuff that he had
real depression too,

7487
03:23:15,231 --> 03:23:17,300
and he's essentially was young.

7488
03:23:17,390 --> 03:23:22,390
I was and but anti anxiety medication
has various effects on people.

7489
03:23:22,570 --> 03:23:25,460
There's some people it's a godsend for,

7490
03:23:25,760 --> 03:23:27,410
but it's just like the Brazil nuts thing.

7491
03:23:27,440 --> 03:23:30,500
There's some people that going to have
an adverse reaction to it and you have to

7492
03:23:30,501 --> 03:23:32,660
be prepared for whatever
that reaction could be.

7493
03:23:32,750 --> 03:23:32,901
Yeah,

7494
03:23:32,901 --> 03:23:33,734
that's a good point.

7495
03:23:34,100 --> 03:23:34,341
Yeah.

7496
03:23:34,341 --> 03:23:35,570
It's all fucking bummer,

7497
03:23:35,571 --> 03:23:35,871
man.

7498
03:23:35,871 --> 03:23:36,510
The human body,

7499
03:23:36,510 --> 03:23:37,490
we don't have it figured out,

7500
03:23:37,491 --> 03:23:38,181
but God damn,

7501
03:23:38,181 --> 03:23:39,220
they're getting closer and closer.

7502
03:23:39,230 --> 03:23:41,570
It goes back to the fact that
we're all very complicated.

7503
03:23:41,571 --> 03:23:42,500
We're all individuals.

7504
03:23:42,560 --> 03:23:44,360
So I have a little
compassion for each other.

7505
03:23:44,390 --> 03:23:45,290
Have a little compassion,

7506
03:23:45,291 --> 03:23:46,124
would be nice.

7507
03:23:46,280 --> 03:23:48,500
There's a lot of people lashing
out because they don't feel good.

7508
03:23:48,710 --> 03:23:49,580
And I'll watch this lady,

7509
03:23:49,581 --> 03:23:50,990
the other deck cut in front of somebody.

7510
03:23:51,230 --> 03:23:52,280
It was hilarious.

7511
03:23:52,610 --> 03:23:56,840
This guy's trying to get into this lane
and this lady speeds up to try to keep

7512
03:23:56,841 --> 03:23:59,120
the guy from getting in the
lane and the guy sees it.

7513
03:23:59,121 --> 03:24:02,660
So he just kind of eases over anyway
and she just lays on her horn,

7514
03:24:02,900 --> 03:24:03,980
bam.

7515
03:24:04,160 --> 03:24:06,740
And then the guy pulls
up like he's in this,

7516
03:24:06,950 --> 03:24:10,250
he's in his lane now and he pulls
up and she gets in the next lane,

7517
03:24:10,430 --> 03:24:11,630
shoots in front of them,

7518
03:24:11,780 --> 03:24:14,270
turns her car in front of
them and slams on the brakes.

7519
03:24:14,810 --> 03:24:19,460
And so he gets to the left of her and
just starts going towards her and she

7520
03:24:19,461 --> 03:24:22,250
freaks out and turns into traffic
and has to slam on the breaks.

7521
03:24:22,251 --> 03:24:27,251
Like you just had a crazy hissy fit over
nothing cause you did that conti thing

7522
03:24:28,131 --> 03:24:30,650
that all of us have been guilty of doing
where you don't let somebody in your

7523
03:24:30,651 --> 03:24:30,950
lane.

7524
03:24:30,950 --> 03:24:31,551
And this guy was like,

7525
03:24:31,551 --> 03:24:32,121
fuck you,

7526
03:24:32,121 --> 03:24:32,954
I'm getting in.

7527
03:24:33,230 --> 03:24:34,520
It's like she sped up,

7528
03:24:34,550 --> 03:24:37,760
she sped up to keep it from going in and
I saw you watched it all play out and

7529
03:24:37,761 --> 03:24:37,971
you're like,

7530
03:24:37,971 --> 03:24:38,480
wow.

7531
03:24:38,480 --> 03:24:43,480
I was in Park City with my mother driving
her SUV and I wasn't driving fast.

7532
03:24:43,891 --> 03:24:44,700
And this woman,

7533
03:24:44,700 --> 03:24:46,710
older woman with a very old,

7534
03:24:46,711 --> 03:24:51,240
like an old matronly like you used to be
the principal of your school and short

7535
03:24:51,241 --> 03:24:51,451
hair.

7536
03:24:51,451 --> 03:24:53,970
And she had her golden
retriever and she uh,

7537
03:24:54,570 --> 03:24:56,070
dressed in a preppy fashion.

7538
03:24:56,360 --> 03:24:57,300
Slow down.

7539
03:24:57,540 --> 03:24:58,110
Oh my God.

7540
03:24:58,110 --> 03:24:58,671
And then I go,

7541
03:24:58,671 --> 03:24:58,920
oh.

7542
03:24:58,920 --> 03:25:01,810
And I wasn't even like
fast and she just goes and,

7543
03:25:02,150 --> 03:25:03,600
and I could hear her make that noise.

7544
03:25:03,601 --> 03:25:07,650
She goes like that with her and she
gave me the hardest middle finger.

7545
03:25:07,690 --> 03:25:08,161
Oh my God.

7546
03:25:08,161 --> 03:25:08,640
I went,

7547
03:25:08,640 --> 03:25:09,960
are you kidding me?

7548
03:25:10,410 --> 03:25:11,101
And she goes,

7549
03:25:11,101 --> 03:25:13,380
I'm calling the police and
reached for her phone right away.

7550
03:25:14,040 --> 03:25:14,873
I got,

7551
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:15,541
that's what I said.

7552
03:25:15,541 --> 03:25:15,840
I go,

7553
03:25:15,840 --> 03:25:16,110
oh,

7554
03:25:16,110 --> 03:25:16,690
her one.

7555
03:25:16,690 --> 03:25:18,450
I go have a nice day.

7556
03:25:18,451 --> 03:25:19,410
And just kept going.

7557
03:25:19,680 --> 03:25:22,500
I remember getting in a road
rage situation with this
dude when I first moved to

7558
03:25:22,501 --> 03:25:23,100
La.

7559
03:25:23,100 --> 03:25:26,520
We're looking at each other on the highway
and he takes his shirt off to show me

7560
03:25:26,521 --> 03:25:27,354
his tattoo.

7561
03:25:28,200 --> 03:25:30,570
He's screaming at me and I'm not reacting.

7562
03:25:30,580 --> 03:25:31,440
I'm just looking at him.

7563
03:25:31,441 --> 03:25:31,741
I'm like,

7564
03:25:31,741 --> 03:25:32,760
what is going to happen here?

7565
03:25:33,090 --> 03:25:33,470
I'm like,

7566
03:25:33,470 --> 03:25:35,790
why is this guy trying
so hard to scare me?

7567
03:25:35,791 --> 03:25:36,091
He's like,

7568
03:25:36,091 --> 03:25:37,500
fuck you fucking pull over.

7569
03:25:37,680 --> 03:25:38,670
Fucking pull over.

7570
03:25:38,880 --> 03:25:40,020
So he takes his shirt off.

7571
03:25:40,420 --> 03:25:43,260
He's got all these tattoos by
the ways it does not look built.

7572
03:25:43,560 --> 03:25:43,921
I'm like,

7573
03:25:43,921 --> 03:25:44,111
you're,

7574
03:25:44,111 --> 03:25:44,970
you're in trouble fella.

7575
03:25:44,971 --> 03:25:46,880
You don't really want to
know how to fight sloppy.

7576
03:25:46,920 --> 03:25:49,920
It's highly doubt me get
fooled sometimes when I'm like,

7577
03:25:49,921 --> 03:25:51,420
this is a guy who's trying to scare me,

7578
03:25:51,421 --> 03:25:52,050
which is probably,

7579
03:25:52,050 --> 03:25:53,850
he's probably terrified of noise.

7580
03:25:53,870 --> 03:25:54,150
Yeah.

7581
03:25:54,150 --> 03:25:56,250
And not so I'm just looking at them
and the more I'm looking at him,

7582
03:25:56,251 --> 03:25:58,920
he just keeps screaming at me
because I'm not reacting to them.

7583
03:25:58,921 --> 03:25:59,450
I'm just like,

7584
03:25:59,450 --> 03:26:02,340
like looking at him and he's screaming
and I'm in my car driving and he's

7585
03:26:02,341 --> 03:26:04,190
looking at me and uh,

7586
03:26:04,260 --> 03:26:05,670
I was driving a suburban too,

7587
03:26:05,671 --> 03:26:07,530
which I thought was
hilarious cause he goes,

7588
03:26:07,650 --> 03:26:09,060
you rich piece of shit.

7589
03:26:09,800 --> 03:26:10,080
I was like,

7590
03:26:10,080 --> 03:26:10,891
I'm going to suburban.

7591
03:26:10,891 --> 03:26:12,510
How do you know if I'm rich suburb?

7592
03:26:12,660 --> 03:26:13,980
Even like a rich car,

7593
03:26:13,981 --> 03:26:15,330
like the fuck are you talking about?

7594
03:26:15,331 --> 03:26:16,410
Like where's this coming from?

7595
03:26:16,800 --> 03:26:20,940
It was real screaming and I was thinking
at this time I could make a terrible

7596
03:26:20,941 --> 03:26:22,140
mistake while I could tell you,

7597
03:26:22,141 --> 03:26:22,501
oh yeah,

7598
03:26:22,501 --> 03:26:23,850
I think I could just fuck this guy up.

7599
03:26:23,851 --> 03:26:25,260
Let me just pull this
car over and teaches.

7600
03:26:25,261 --> 03:26:26,400
Asshole was the young guy.

7601
03:26:26,700 --> 03:26:26,850
Yeah.

7602
03:26:26,850 --> 03:26:27,780
Which yeah,

7603
03:26:27,781 --> 03:26:30,540
I wasn't only like 28 at the time.

7604
03:26:30,541 --> 03:26:32,010
I was still pretty fucking stupid,

7605
03:26:32,730 --> 03:26:36,570
but this guy screaming at me almost
maybe realize how dumb it is.

7606
03:26:36,870 --> 03:26:37,231
I was like,

7607
03:26:37,231 --> 03:26:38,610
watch this guy taking his shirt off.

7608
03:26:38,660 --> 03:26:41,220
Show upside to this day though.

7609
03:26:41,460 --> 03:26:42,300
To this day they'd be like,

7610
03:26:42,301 --> 03:26:45,250
a day would go by that I would think
I should just fuck that dude up.

7611
03:26:46,170 --> 03:26:47,003
Disaster.

7612
03:26:48,460 --> 03:26:52,110
A best case scenario though,

7613
03:26:52,170 --> 03:26:56,040
I literally think I should have just
pulled over and kicked up fucking dude's

7614
03:26:56,041 --> 03:26:57,660
legs out from under them and choke them.

7615
03:26:57,661 --> 03:26:59,130
Unconscious be hilarious,

7616
03:26:59,160 --> 03:27:00,060
but it's so stupid.

7617
03:27:00,240 --> 03:27:02,940
It's hard for those
thoughts 20 years later.

7618
03:27:03,210 --> 03:27:06,330
That's how dumb those instances
where you want to go into a lane,

7619
03:27:06,331 --> 03:27:07,190
someone doesn't want to let you in.

7620
03:27:07,191 --> 03:27:08,940
They speed up and get fucking Hong Kong.

7621
03:27:08,970 --> 03:27:10,650
Fuck you like that tension.

7622
03:27:10,920 --> 03:27:11,641
It's so dumb.

7623
03:27:11,641 --> 03:27:14,160
You'll hold onto some of those
dumb thoughts for decades.

7624
03:27:14,160 --> 03:27:14,540
Dude,

7625
03:27:14,540 --> 03:27:15,420
I have a guy,

7626
03:27:15,421 --> 03:27:17,290
the other day I was
driving off Abot Kenny.

7627
03:27:17,300 --> 03:27:20,970
I looked at my phone at directions and
I was at a stop sign and you know it was

7628
03:27:20,971 --> 03:27:21,631
my turn to go,

7629
03:27:21,631 --> 03:27:24,630
but I was looking down at my phone
for directions and this guy behind me,

7630
03:27:24,631 --> 03:27:26,130
he's like a regular worker,

7631
03:27:26,131 --> 03:27:26,964
like in a car,

7632
03:27:27,210 --> 03:27:28,650
just goes nuts,

7633
03:27:28,710 --> 03:27:29,221
nuts,

7634
03:27:29,221 --> 03:27:30,054
honking horn.

7635
03:27:30,250 --> 03:27:30,861
I'd wave that.

7636
03:27:30,861 --> 03:27:32,880
I'm like my Batman and then I'm driving.

7637
03:27:32,881 --> 03:27:37,881
He goes around me who slams on the brakes
and starts flipping off talking shit.

7638
03:27:38,760 --> 03:27:39,750
Oh my God,

7639
03:27:39,751 --> 03:27:40,081
dude,

7640
03:27:40,081 --> 03:27:41,410
come on God.

7641
03:27:41,530 --> 03:27:42,100
And I'm like,

7642
03:27:42,100 --> 03:27:42,620
all right.

7643
03:27:42,620 --> 03:27:43,150
All right,

7644
03:27:43,150 --> 03:27:43,601
go me.

7645
03:27:43,601 --> 03:27:44,231
I got it.

7646
03:27:44,231 --> 03:27:45,150
I got to up,

7647
03:27:45,310 --> 03:27:46,143
keep going.

7648
03:27:46,390 --> 03:27:47,770
And then he won't let me go.

7649
03:27:47,771 --> 03:27:48,041
I'm like,

7650
03:27:48,041 --> 03:27:48,311
dude,

7651
03:27:48,311 --> 03:27:49,300
y'all let me go man.

7652
03:27:49,460 --> 03:27:50,610
And he just keeps talking shit.

7653
03:27:50,630 --> 03:27:50,890
I'm like,

7654
03:27:50,890 --> 03:27:52,270
what the fuck am I going to do,

7655
03:27:52,271 --> 03:27:52,840
man?

7656
03:27:52,840 --> 03:27:54,500
I'm gonna beat up this tab,

7657
03:27:54,820 --> 03:27:56,110
the fuck am I going to do?

7658
03:27:56,170 --> 03:27:58,960
But he's playing a game that
he thinks he's safe playing.

7659
03:27:59,030 --> 03:27:59,300
I don't know,

7660
03:27:59,300 --> 03:28:00,820
because we're not in Serbia.

7661
03:28:00,850 --> 03:28:03,160
Nobody's pulling guns out and
gunning people down the street.

7662
03:28:03,161 --> 03:28:03,760
This,

7663
03:28:03,760 --> 03:28:04,420
these people,

7664
03:28:04,420 --> 03:28:05,800
they'll do that kind of shit.

7665
03:28:05,860 --> 03:28:07,840
I watched these two guys race
each other and they were,

7666
03:28:07,841 --> 03:28:10,840
they were cutting in front of each other
and slam on the breaks and doing that

7667
03:28:10,841 --> 03:28:11,021
thing.

7668
03:28:11,021 --> 03:28:14,740
It's slamming the brakes and yelling
shit at each other at the window and just

7669
03:28:14,741 --> 03:28:15,251
watch him.

7670
03:28:15,251 --> 03:28:15,761
And he'd go like,

7671
03:28:15,761 --> 03:28:17,230
this could be nothing.

7672
03:28:17,320 --> 03:28:18,700
Or it could be your life.

7673
03:28:18,701 --> 03:28:19,021
Correct.

7674
03:28:19,021 --> 03:28:19,200
Like,

7675
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:20,290
you could hit that guy,

7676
03:28:20,291 --> 03:28:21,340
he can go into traffic.

7677
03:28:21,341 --> 03:28:22,300
Somebody could die,

7678
03:28:22,540 --> 03:28:23,800
he could hit someone on the street.

7679
03:28:23,801 --> 03:28:23,921
Like,

7680
03:28:23,921 --> 03:28:25,030
you guys are speeding.

7681
03:28:25,031 --> 03:28:26,860
Like you're in this death race.

7682
03:28:26,861 --> 03:28:28,720
Like you're in some fucking mad max movie.

7683
03:28:28,780 --> 03:28:28,990
Well,

7684
03:28:28,990 --> 03:28:30,670
you're on a residential street to me,

7685
03:28:30,720 --> 03:28:31,030
this guy,

7686
03:28:31,030 --> 03:28:32,650
he's yelled at me and I'm like,

7687
03:28:32,651 --> 03:28:33,221
what are you gonna do,

7688
03:28:33,221 --> 03:28:33,640
man?

7689
03:28:33,640 --> 03:28:34,241
What are you going to do?

7690
03:28:34,241 --> 03:28:34,660
You're going to cut.

7691
03:28:34,660 --> 03:28:35,300
You gotta go,

7692
03:28:35,300 --> 03:28:36,820
you gonna fight me with the fucking to do.

7693
03:28:37,030 --> 03:28:37,300
And he's,

7694
03:28:37,300 --> 03:28:37,750
yeah,

7695
03:28:37,750 --> 03:28:38,021
yeah,

7696
03:28:38,021 --> 03:28:38,740
that's a big deck.

7697
03:28:38,740 --> 03:28:39,573
What the fuck?

7698
03:28:39,660 --> 03:28:40,493
And I was like,

7699
03:28:42,430 --> 03:28:43,810
I took off my glasses on.

7700
03:28:43,811 --> 03:28:43,961
What?

7701
03:28:43,961 --> 03:28:45,220
You're fucking serious.

7702
03:28:45,250 --> 03:28:46,480
You're serious right now.

7703
03:28:46,820 --> 03:28:47,141
He's like,

7704
03:28:47,141 --> 03:28:47,951
oh it keeps going.

7705
03:28:47,951 --> 03:28:48,784
And then I thought,

7706
03:28:48,880 --> 03:28:51,570
what am I going to get out and
get shot and fight this guy,

7707
03:28:52,110 --> 03:28:56,380
he has a gun and I was wanting to go
left by coming cause he's blocked me.

7708
03:28:56,470 --> 03:28:57,460
So I went right.

7709
03:28:57,820 --> 03:28:58,211
I thought,

7710
03:28:58,211 --> 03:28:58,451
man,

7711
03:28:58,451 --> 03:28:59,250
my brother and my,

7712
03:28:59,250 --> 03:29:01,480
and my friends will make fun of me
for going right when I show went,

7713
03:29:01,750 --> 03:29:03,160
but it's the right thing to do.

7714
03:29:03,220 --> 03:29:04,480
So right there I'm like,

7715
03:29:04,481 --> 03:29:05,081
what am I going to do?

7716
03:29:05,081 --> 03:29:05,914
Fight this fucking guy.

7717
03:29:05,920 --> 03:29:07,120
Think of that as being like,

7718
03:29:07,121 --> 03:29:08,110
you're running to a dog.

7719
03:29:08,990 --> 03:29:09,970
Are you supposed to like,

7720
03:29:09,971 --> 03:29:11,200
hey fuck you dog.

7721
03:29:11,260 --> 03:29:11,441
No,

7722
03:29:11,441 --> 03:29:12,041
you sit,

7723
03:29:12,041 --> 03:29:12,550
bitch.

7724
03:29:12,550 --> 03:29:13,720
Sit and supposed to go.

7725
03:29:13,870 --> 03:29:14,703
I got to go.

7726
03:29:14,740 --> 03:29:16,390
But the problem is it's a person.

7727
03:29:16,420 --> 03:29:18,520
So a person you think of
is different than a dog.

7728
03:29:18,710 --> 03:29:21,010
Dog is not going to get the
fuck away from that dog.

7729
03:29:21,220 --> 03:29:21,371
Yeah,

7730
03:29:21,371 --> 03:29:22,810
get the fuck away from that person too.

7731
03:29:22,860 --> 03:29:24,850
It's the ego thing to listen.

7732
03:29:24,851 --> 03:29:25,170
Dude,

7733
03:29:25,170 --> 03:29:28,750
I didn't have that 9.9% of the fucking
human beings you're going to interact

7734
03:29:28,751 --> 03:29:28,931
with.

7735
03:29:28,931 --> 03:29:31,960
You could kill that should
play heavy on your mind.

7736
03:29:31,960 --> 03:29:34,150
Know that you know I played
on my mind was I went,

7737
03:29:34,180 --> 03:29:36,010
I bet he's going through some shit.

7738
03:29:36,040 --> 03:29:37,720
He probably went like a double shift.

7739
03:29:38,410 --> 03:29:41,480
Someone probably was
texting before me and he,

7740
03:29:41,740 --> 03:29:43,150
he's just taking his anger out on me.

7741
03:29:43,151 --> 03:29:44,020
I'm just going to go right.

7742
03:29:44,021 --> 03:29:44,711
Fuck this man.

7743
03:29:44,711 --> 03:29:45,370
I don't need this.

7744
03:29:45,370 --> 03:29:45,700
Yeah,

7745
03:29:45,700 --> 03:29:48,400
but he could have been 10 you know,

7746
03:29:48,460 --> 03:29:53,260
and still acted like that and you
should have the same reaction like,

7747
03:29:53,290 --> 03:29:54,123
oh God.

7748
03:29:54,130 --> 03:29:55,780
Like it's a child time.

7749
03:29:55,960 --> 03:29:56,531
He's a child.

7750
03:29:56,531 --> 03:29:57,480
He's a grownup baby.

7751
03:29:57,490 --> 03:29:58,191
When he cut me off,

7752
03:29:58,191 --> 03:29:59,440
the enemy's going to kick your ass.

7753
03:29:59,470 --> 03:29:59,771
I know.

7754
03:29:59,771 --> 03:30:00,080
I was like,

7755
03:30:00,080 --> 03:30:00,580
crap,

7756
03:30:00,580 --> 03:30:01,420
I want to two things,

7757
03:30:01,421 --> 03:30:03,520
either as a gun or he's fucking insane.

7758
03:30:03,700 --> 03:30:04,920
Those are the only two possibilities.

7759
03:30:04,921 --> 03:30:05,530
Correct.

7760
03:30:05,530 --> 03:30:05,920
Right.

7761
03:30:05,920 --> 03:30:08,870
Or he doesn't realize your
gorilla sitting in your car.

7762
03:30:08,871 --> 03:30:11,030
You look like a normal size
personal orange portion.

7763
03:30:11,650 --> 03:30:12,940
Fuck this warmup.

7764
03:30:13,210 --> 03:30:13,421
Yeah.

7765
03:30:13,421 --> 03:30:16,260
He probably feels like you're
some preppy dickhead bel air.

7766
03:30:16,780 --> 03:30:18,040
Some Cutie Pie.

7767
03:30:18,041 --> 03:30:18,874
And be right.

7768
03:30:20,900 --> 03:30:23,370
Was talking about like
road rage incidents,

7769
03:30:23,530 --> 03:30:23,771
you know,

7770
03:30:23,771 --> 03:30:25,960
they've figured out why
people have road rage too.

7771
03:30:26,170 --> 03:30:28,270
And one of the reasons
why to curse so often,

7772
03:30:28,271 --> 03:30:31,300
it's not just a separation by barriers
between you and the other person.

7773
03:30:31,301 --> 03:30:32,380
So you don't have social cues.

7774
03:30:32,620 --> 03:30:37,120
It's also that your senses are jacked
up because you're in the situation where

7775
03:30:37,121 --> 03:30:40,010
you know that you have
to react potentially

7776
03:30:40,190 --> 03:30:42,020
at a very fast rate.

7777
03:30:42,320 --> 03:30:45,290
You have to be able to react
instantaneously to someone
changed the only slam on

7778
03:30:45,291 --> 03:30:45,590
the breaks.

7779
03:30:45,590 --> 03:30:45,800
Yeah.

7780
03:30:45,800 --> 03:30:49,820
Got gotta be so you're at
heightened states and so
then you interact with people

7781
03:30:49,821 --> 03:30:52,550
that you think maybe are fucking with
that heightened state and he doesn't want

7782
03:30:52,551 --> 03:30:55,400
to lay on that horn you
piece of shit to cut me off.

7783
03:30:55,401 --> 03:30:56,570
And you and everybody,

7784
03:30:56,600 --> 03:30:57,560
everybody's been guilty of it.

7785
03:30:57,561 --> 03:31:00,110
And everybody has to
learn to negotiate those,

7786
03:31:00,111 --> 03:31:00,944
that weird,

7787
03:31:01,070 --> 03:31:01,590
uh,

7788
03:31:01,590 --> 03:31:06,050
extra urge of aggression that you get
when you're in your car and don't,

7789
03:31:06,051 --> 03:31:07,580
don't get out of the car and fight.

7790
03:31:07,581 --> 03:31:08,270
Don't do it.

7791
03:31:08,270 --> 03:31:08,511
No,

7792
03:31:08,511 --> 03:31:08,871
don't do it.

7793
03:31:08,871 --> 03:31:09,860
But people want to do it,

7794
03:31:09,861 --> 03:31:10,190
man.

7795
03:31:10,190 --> 03:31:11,390
They want to do it all the time.

7796
03:31:12,190 --> 03:31:12,950
No bad idea.

7797
03:31:12,950 --> 03:31:13,431
People shoot,

7798
03:31:13,431 --> 03:31:17,300
people look at your head and
you've got to kind of a big head.

7799
03:31:17,360 --> 03:31:18,590
Now you've got a friendly faith man.

7800
03:31:18,590 --> 03:31:19,970
What about your ears like I did,

7801
03:31:22,070 --> 03:31:22,540
first of all,

7802
03:31:22,540 --> 03:31:23,960
this bullshit haircut.

7803
03:31:23,961 --> 03:31:25,370
I'm in a orange Porsche.

7804
03:31:25,490 --> 03:31:27,770
I probably got skinny
jeans on so when I get,

7805
03:31:27,771 --> 03:31:28,640
I get the binding.

7806
03:31:28,641 --> 03:31:29,181
Anyone,

7807
03:31:29,181 --> 03:31:30,280
he's not thinking of finding it.

7808
03:31:30,281 --> 03:31:31,760
It's all opposing thing.

7809
03:31:31,761 --> 03:31:32,330
It's all,

7810
03:31:32,330 --> 03:31:33,710
it's all a bluff charge.

7811
03:31:33,890 --> 03:31:34,850
It's all bluff charge.

7812
03:31:34,851 --> 03:31:37,520
That's exactly what it it all
the way he cut me off though.

7813
03:31:37,521 --> 03:31:38,450
This guy was down.

7814
03:31:38,510 --> 03:31:38,730
She had,

7815
03:31:38,730 --> 03:31:39,650
but he's not down.

7816
03:31:39,651 --> 03:31:41,930
It's like a like a
gorilla running up to you.

7817
03:31:41,931 --> 03:31:43,750
It was never planning on smashing it.

7818
03:31:43,850 --> 03:31:44,541
The shit worked.

7819
03:31:44,541 --> 03:31:45,374
I went right,

7820
03:31:45,500 --> 03:31:46,270
go left,

7821
03:31:46,270 --> 03:31:47,091
go all the way around.

7822
03:31:47,091 --> 03:31:47,990
He went home.

7823
03:31:47,991 --> 03:31:49,100
His Dick was hard as a rock.

7824
03:31:49,140 --> 03:31:50,420
He fucked the shit out of his wife.

7825
03:31:50,760 --> 03:31:51,680
I'm a fucking man.

7826
03:31:51,740 --> 03:31:54,600
It was a guy cut me off and I told him
to fuck off or you want to fight your

7827
03:31:54,610 --> 03:31:55,310
mother fucker?

7828
03:31:55,310 --> 03:31:56,091
He said no,

7829
03:31:56,091 --> 03:31:56,890
and I'm going to fuck you.

7830
03:31:56,890 --> 03:31:57,723
And

7831
03:31:58,700 --> 03:31:59,650
they say they say that.

7832
03:31:59,820 --> 03:32:04,070
And what was that book by Malcolm
Gladwell wearing wherever you're from,

7833
03:32:04,560 --> 03:32:04,910
um,

7834
03:32:04,910 --> 03:32:08,180
has to do with how you react to a fronts.

7835
03:32:08,210 --> 03:32:13,210
So like they did this experiment
where they would have a Guy Bay,

7836
03:32:14,180 --> 03:32:17,960
they'd have you take two fake tests and
you had to take a test in this room and

7837
03:32:17,961 --> 03:32:20,030
then you had to go down the hall
and take a test in another room.

7838
03:32:20,270 --> 03:32:23,390
As you are walking down the hall
together test you would get,

7839
03:32:23,450 --> 03:32:24,080
um,

7840
03:32:24,080 --> 03:32:25,130
somebody would walk by you,

7841
03:32:25,140 --> 03:32:28,730
bump you and go watch out
ass hole and keep walking.

7842
03:32:29,510 --> 03:32:33,980
And the dude's from the south
versus the guys from the north.

7843
03:32:34,280 --> 03:32:35,300
The dude's from the south,

7844
03:32:35,301 --> 03:32:36,590
there's Sarah Tall level,

7845
03:32:36,591 --> 03:32:36,921
whatever the,

7846
03:32:36,921 --> 03:32:37,820
all those levels.

7847
03:32:38,150 --> 03:32:39,770
There's Sarah told levels,

7848
03:32:39,771 --> 03:32:40,910
their testosterone levels,

7849
03:32:40,911 --> 03:32:43,190
everything was Jack to the fucking roof.

7850
03:32:43,430 --> 03:32:44,960
They were ready to fight dude.

7851
03:32:44,961 --> 03:32:45,794
Some in north,

7852
03:32:45,830 --> 03:32:46,400
Nah,

7853
03:32:46,400 --> 03:32:47,150
not at all.

7854
03:32:47,150 --> 03:32:47,630
They were like,

7855
03:32:47,630 --> 03:32:48,050
Huh,

7856
03:32:48,050 --> 03:32:48,620
whatever.

7857
03:32:48,620 --> 03:32:49,453
What a Dick.

7858
03:32:49,790 --> 03:32:54,790
And it had to do according to global and
not really also this guy in this bit as

7859
03:32:54,951 --> 03:32:55,784
well.

7860
03:32:55,790 --> 03:32:58,010
It had to do with where you are from.

7861
03:32:58,040 --> 03:32:59,210
And more importantly,

7862
03:32:59,211 --> 03:33:01,400
where your ancestry heralded from.

7863
03:33:01,430 --> 03:33:06,430
If you came from a culture and
honor culture as opposed to a,

7864
03:33:07,281 --> 03:33:08,960
what they call the dignity culture.

7865
03:33:08,961 --> 03:33:12,470
So if you came from a culture
where honor was everything,

7866
03:33:12,471 --> 03:33:14,510
and those cultures are hurting cultures,

7867
03:33:14,780 --> 03:33:16,050
that's where you get the Chinese.

7868
03:33:16,060 --> 03:33:17,160
That's where you get the Afghanis.

7869
03:33:17,180 --> 03:33:19,160
That's where you get the North Scots,

7870
03:33:19,190 --> 03:33:20,023
Irish.

7871
03:33:20,210 --> 03:33:21,440
That's why Armenians,

7872
03:33:21,710 --> 03:33:22,410
Armenians,

7873
03:33:22,410 --> 03:33:23,720
wines will fuck you up.

7874
03:33:23,760 --> 03:33:24,593
Yes,

7875
03:33:24,920 --> 03:33:26,480
Armenians are tough shit.

7876
03:33:26,600 --> 03:33:27,331
Shoulder checks.

7877
03:33:27,331 --> 03:33:28,670
I'm Armenian in the street.

7878
03:33:29,900 --> 03:33:30,920
They will punch you in the,

7879
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:32,000
they don't fuck around.

7880
03:33:32,030 --> 03:33:35,070
Our meeting yourself was scrapped
and tight knit communities.

7881
03:33:35,450 --> 03:33:36,200
I like that.

7882
03:33:36,200 --> 03:33:36,471
But,

7883
03:33:36,471 --> 03:33:36,770
but,

7884
03:33:36,770 --> 03:33:37,590
but it was,

7885
03:33:37,590 --> 03:33:42,360
it was from honor cultures and the
Scots Irish who settled where the

7886
03:33:42,361 --> 03:33:43,320
Appalachians,

7887
03:33:43,690 --> 03:33:44,160
the,

7888
03:33:44,160 --> 03:33:44,510
the,

7889
03:33:44,510 --> 03:33:46,170
the Hatfields and McCoys

7890
03:33:48,060 --> 03:33:48,661
the fuck.

7891
03:33:48,661 --> 03:33:49,494
Yup.

7892
03:33:49,710 --> 03:33:51,000
When you go to Ireland,

7893
03:33:51,030 --> 03:33:53,250
you go to parts of the UK,

7894
03:33:53,520 --> 03:33:54,180
you know,

7895
03:33:54,180 --> 03:33:55,770
in the north where Tony's from,

7896
03:33:55,890 --> 03:33:56,491
good luck.

7897
03:33:56,491 --> 03:33:57,720
Go see what happens in a bar.

7898
03:33:57,721 --> 03:33:59,160
When you want to get scrappy,

7899
03:33:59,190 --> 03:33:59,491
you'll,

7900
03:33:59,491 --> 03:34:02,280
you'll find plenty of
men to meet you halfway.

7901
03:34:02,760 --> 03:34:07,170
Whereas if you go to certain other parts
of the world where they didn't come

7902
03:34:07,171 --> 03:34:08,700
from hurting cultures,

7903
03:34:08,701 --> 03:34:10,950
where they came from a culture that,

7904
03:34:10,980 --> 03:34:11,340
uh,

7905
03:34:11,340 --> 03:34:15,390
relied mostly on agriculture
where it relied on cooperation,

7906
03:34:15,600 --> 03:34:16,231
where it see,

7907
03:34:16,231 --> 03:34:19,410
cause when you're a herder and
somebody steals your sheep,

7908
03:34:20,310 --> 03:34:22,080
you will not survive the winter.

7909
03:34:22,350 --> 03:34:25,590
So you've got to let everybody
know that if you do steal my sheep,

7910
03:34:25,620 --> 03:34:29,640
I'm going to kill you and every man in
your fucking family because I'm a crazy

7911
03:34:29,641 --> 03:34:30,270
motherfucker.

7912
03:34:30,270 --> 03:34:30,930
So,

7913
03:34:30,930 --> 03:34:31,651
so you know,

7914
03:34:31,651 --> 03:34:31,950
it's,

7915
03:34:31,950 --> 03:34:33,180
it's do or die here,

7916
03:34:33,600 --> 03:34:34,020
right?

7917
03:34:34,020 --> 03:34:35,850
It's literally survival of your family.

7918
03:34:35,880 --> 03:34:36,930
Nisbett and,

7919
03:34:36,931 --> 03:34:37,640
and uh,

7920
03:34:37,640 --> 03:34:39,660
the Gladwell did and he
just wrote a book about it.

7921
03:34:39,661 --> 03:34:42,720
But like some of these guys who actually
did the primary research on that proof

7922
03:34:42,900 --> 03:34:43,920
that culture,

7923
03:34:44,160 --> 03:34:46,140
even though you don't know those people,

7924
03:34:46,141 --> 03:34:47,490
even though your generations,

7925
03:34:47,550 --> 03:34:47,851
you know,

7926
03:34:47,851 --> 03:34:49,410
removed from that in this country,

7927
03:34:49,650 --> 03:34:51,390
that shit has deep,

7928
03:34:51,540 --> 03:34:53,910
deep roots in your cultural psyche.

7929
03:34:54,160 --> 03:34:54,691
And,

7930
03:34:54,691 --> 03:34:58,050
and of course also a
form of genetic memory,

7931
03:34:58,470 --> 03:34:59,161
genetic memory,

7932
03:34:59,161 --> 03:35:00,660
but also cultural memory also,

7933
03:35:00,661 --> 03:35:01,020
that's,

7934
03:35:01,020 --> 03:35:03,600
you're raised as a man to,

7935
03:35:03,690 --> 03:35:05,820
to protect your cubic space.

7936
03:35:06,280 --> 03:35:07,071
Who had to fight me.

7937
03:35:07,071 --> 03:35:08,100
He was with a herder.

7938
03:35:08,490 --> 03:35:09,390
I'm sure he was.

7939
03:35:10,290 --> 03:35:13,800
It was probably on Adderall
and he's felt he was down.

7940
03:35:13,860 --> 03:35:14,870
He's bluffed charges.

7941
03:35:14,880 --> 03:35:16,140
Just got off a double shift.

7942
03:35:16,141 --> 03:35:17,070
He has a hurting,

7943
03:35:17,130 --> 03:35:17,990
hurting mentos.

7944
03:35:18,020 --> 03:35:19,170
What kind of car did he have?

7945
03:35:19,470 --> 03:35:21,930
It was a la county truck.

7946
03:35:22,530 --> 03:35:23,080
Oh,

7947
03:35:23,080 --> 03:35:23,913
was Mexican.

7948
03:35:24,940 --> 03:35:26,580
You guys want to read
about that geography?

7949
03:35:26,581 --> 03:35:27,001
I thought,

7950
03:35:27,001 --> 03:35:28,730
I think by a Harold husband.

7951
03:35:28,950 --> 03:35:33,600
He's a phenomenal guy and
bringing how truck geography,

7952
03:35:33,650 --> 03:35:34,590
that's lot move.

7953
03:35:34,650 --> 03:35:36,000
It's a way to get fired real quick.

7954
03:35:36,180 --> 03:35:37,380
Give a fuck.

7955
03:35:38,010 --> 03:35:38,843
Gotcha.

7956
03:35:38,910 --> 03:35:39,743
He got me,

7957
03:35:39,960 --> 03:35:40,420
he got me.

7958
03:35:40,420 --> 03:35:41,790
I had to go around the block.

7959
03:35:41,850 --> 03:35:44,970
It took me more time cause you don't
come from that call was embarrassed.

7960
03:35:47,670 --> 03:35:49,060
Funny how he's such a bad ass,

7961
03:35:49,061 --> 03:35:49,491
but he's like,

7962
03:35:49,491 --> 03:35:49,680
no,

7963
03:35:49,680 --> 03:35:50,910
it's not that I don't my,

7964
03:35:51,010 --> 03:35:52,200
but you do that to my brother.

7965
03:35:52,260 --> 03:35:53,093
Listen,

7966
03:35:53,460 --> 03:35:55,530
my brother said some issues on the road,

7967
03:35:55,560 --> 03:35:55,921
you know,

7968
03:35:55,921 --> 03:35:56,550
and this stuff.

7969
03:35:56,550 --> 03:35:56,760
I,

7970
03:35:56,760 --> 03:35:59,670
my dad has two I've seen
with my own eyes with me,

7971
03:35:59,671 --> 03:36:00,720
the stuff I have going on.

7972
03:36:00,750 --> 03:36:02,150
If I get out of the car,

7973
03:36:02,220 --> 03:36:02,400
you're,

7974
03:36:02,400 --> 03:36:03,540
I fight that guy.

7975
03:36:03,570 --> 03:36:04,321
I lose everything.

7976
03:36:04,321 --> 03:36:06,090
I stay on for it for sure.

7977
03:36:06,120 --> 03:36:07,210
All my gigs do.

7978
03:36:07,230 --> 03:36:08,790
Everything's gone for and for what?

7979
03:36:08,820 --> 03:36:09,653
But it's self defense,

7980
03:36:09,830 --> 03:36:10,950
but it's not,

7981
03:36:10,980 --> 03:36:12,060
it's not your fault.

7982
03:36:12,090 --> 03:36:12,923
You're forcing yourself.

7983
03:36:13,970 --> 03:36:16,320
And what do you think the headline reads?

7984
03:36:16,380 --> 03:36:18,750
Ellie worker beats up UFC fighter.

7985
03:36:20,220 --> 03:36:20,880
No,

7986
03:36:20,880 --> 03:36:21,571
I hope not.

7987
03:36:21,571 --> 03:36:22,620
No embarrassing.

7988
03:36:23,290 --> 03:36:24,123
Yeah.

7989
03:36:24,270 --> 03:36:25,440
I think you'd have relationships.

7990
03:36:25,441 --> 03:36:26,490
You fight or twists.

7991
03:36:26,491 --> 03:36:27,510
Man's head off,

7992
03:36:27,550 --> 03:36:28,350
gets arrested,

7993
03:36:28,350 --> 03:36:29,183
goes to prison.

7994
03:36:29,830 --> 03:36:30,840
This is not a good move.

7995
03:36:30,870 --> 03:36:32,210
It's show time as he shows.

7996
03:36:32,920 --> 03:36:33,753
No sign.

7997
03:36:34,260 --> 03:36:35,093
There's nothing funny.

7998
03:36:35,580 --> 03:36:35,980
A guy

7999
03:36:35,980 --> 03:36:36,813
beating up another guy.

8000
03:36:37,030 --> 03:36:37,331
No,

8001
03:36:37,331 --> 03:36:38,380
there's no upside to it.

8002
03:36:38,381 --> 03:36:40,060
And it's also you can avoid it.

8003
03:36:40,180 --> 03:36:40,540
You know?

8004
03:36:40,540 --> 03:36:44,010
It can be avoided and pause,

8005
03:36:44,020 --> 03:36:44,681
posturing,

8006
03:36:44,681 --> 03:36:47,380
bullshit and screaming comes
from not being able to fight.

8007
03:36:47,410 --> 03:36:48,280
I agree.

8008
03:36:48,310 --> 03:36:51,100
If you could have a like
a bar filled with Jujitsu,

8009
03:36:51,101 --> 03:36:51,701
black pilots,

8010
03:36:51,701 --> 03:36:53,650
probably the friendliest fucking bar ever.

8011
03:36:53,690 --> 03:36:54,371
You're the tough guys.

8012
03:36:54,371 --> 03:36:54,581
Don't,

8013
03:36:54,581 --> 03:36:57,880
it's like gun culture because
I interviewed a hangout
with a bunch of gun guys

8014
03:36:57,881 --> 03:36:58,120
there.

8015
03:36:58,120 --> 03:37:02,770
They're super formal and respectful
because they're used to seeing bullets

8016
03:37:02,771 --> 03:37:03,371
flying around.

8017
03:37:03,371 --> 03:37:06,250
Everybody's got to mind their p's and
q's when everybody's actually equal.

8018
03:37:06,590 --> 03:37:08,950
If you're a bunch of gun
handlers and all of you,

8019
03:37:08,951 --> 03:37:11,500
you're going to gun competitions and
shit and you shoot and plink plink,

8020
03:37:11,501 --> 03:37:15,010
plink plink roll in and like
fucking Keanu Reeves and shit.

8021
03:37:15,340 --> 03:37:16,200
Those guys,

8022
03:37:16,210 --> 03:37:17,043
you know that's an,

8023
03:37:17,450 --> 03:37:19,540
there are equal to everybody in the world.

8024
03:37:19,570 --> 03:37:20,620
I'll have to do is this,

8025
03:37:20,621 --> 03:37:21,020
I mean they've,

8026
03:37:21,020 --> 03:37:23,800
they bounce it out to a squeeze
of a trigger and seal team.

8027
03:37:23,801 --> 03:37:25,570
We say arms aren't walking around going,

8028
03:37:25,571 --> 03:37:26,530
I'm in the seals.

8029
03:37:26,531 --> 03:37:27,071
Watch out,

8030
03:37:27,071 --> 03:37:27,341
Bro.

8031
03:37:27,341 --> 03:37:28,600
I want to get to the front of the line.

8032
03:37:29,020 --> 03:37:29,651
Exactly.

8033
03:37:29,651 --> 03:37:30,340
Yeah.

8034
03:37:30,340 --> 03:37:33,130
There was a bunch of marines that
came to the common story of the night.

8035
03:37:33,220 --> 03:37:33,941
Real nice guys.

8036
03:37:33,941 --> 03:37:35,500
They were there for this
toys for tots thing,

8037
03:37:35,680 --> 03:37:36,371
hanging out with them,

8038
03:37:36,371 --> 03:37:37,210
talking to them afterwards,

8039
03:37:37,570 --> 03:37:40,960
and then there's some weird drunk guy
comes up to me after the marines left and

8040
03:37:40,961 --> 03:37:42,580
he asked me about recon marines.

8041
03:37:42,840 --> 03:37:43,300
It was like,

8042
03:37:43,300 --> 03:37:43,661
oh,

8043
03:37:43,661 --> 03:37:44,410
look at that.

8044
03:37:44,410 --> 03:37:45,670
It just went in here sick.

8045
03:37:45,700 --> 03:37:47,710
That was throw up ladies and gentlemen.

8046
03:37:47,711 --> 03:37:48,700
That's what we trying to avoid.

8047
03:37:48,701 --> 03:37:49,630
That sounds amazing.

8048
03:37:49,900 --> 03:37:51,130
It just fluid.

8049
03:37:51,160 --> 03:37:52,100
We should probably end this anyway.

8050
03:37:52,101 --> 03:37:52,371
I'm going to,

8051
03:37:52,371 --> 03:37:52,751
who's going to,

8052
03:37:52,751 --> 03:37:52,991
yeah,

8053
03:37:52,991 --> 03:37:53,260
let's,

8054
03:37:53,260 --> 03:37:54,093
I'm going to Mexico.

8055
03:37:54,340 --> 03:37:55,173
He's throwing up again.

8056
03:37:55,480 --> 03:37:56,830
He clean cleaning that thing.

8057
03:37:58,360 --> 03:37:59,230
We just throw that away.

8058
03:37:59,650 --> 03:38:00,483
Give we get another one.

8059
03:38:00,730 --> 03:38:01,331
Let's throw that away.

8060
03:38:01,331 --> 03:38:02,164
We got another,

8061
03:38:02,310 --> 03:38:02,690
you're hurting.

8062
03:38:02,690 --> 03:38:03,460
We're not,

8063
03:38:03,460 --> 03:38:04,293
um,

8064
03:38:04,450 --> 03:38:05,140
blue.

8065
03:38:05,140 --> 03:38:05,331
Ooh.

8066
03:38:05,331 --> 03:38:08,020
I've just watched a bunch of puke
coming out of Brendan jobs mouth.

8067
03:38:08,320 --> 03:38:08,860
Anyway,

8068
03:38:08,860 --> 03:38:09,580
it's all good.

8069
03:38:09,580 --> 03:38:10,001
Super.

8070
03:38:10,001 --> 03:38:11,620
Sorry about all this.

8071
03:38:11,621 --> 03:38:12,070
Good way to end.

8072
03:38:12,070 --> 03:38:12,690
It's good way then.

8073
03:38:12,690 --> 03:38:13,523
It's a good way to end.

8074
03:38:13,690 --> 03:38:14,740
Um,

8075
03:38:16,020 --> 03:38:16,770

03:38:28,750 --> 03:38:29,471

03:38:34,210 --> 03:38:34,331

03:38:37,600 --> 03:38:38,433
27th,

8095
03:38:38,520 --> 03:38:43,520
you could see Fatca and shop at
the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

8096
03:38:43,721 --> 03:38:44,740
but saw dash,

8097
03:38:46,230 --> 03:38:48,670
I'm in Portland before
the 11th to the 13th.

8098
03:38:48,850 --> 03:38:52,390

Let's go see me.

8101
03:38:53,890 --> 03:38:54,723
I won't be sick.

8102
03:38:55,150 --> 03:38:55,421
Yeah.

8103
03:38:55,421 --> 03:38:56,140
He won't be sick.

8104
03:38:56,140 --> 03:38:57,010
Not bitches sold out.

8105
03:38:57,011 --> 03:38:57,844
I love you.

8106
03:38:57,970 --> 03:38:59,140
What are you doing on Wednesday night?

8107
03:38:59,700 --> 03:39:01,360
Why would you want to do
a set at the icehouse?

8108
03:39:01,670 --> 03:39:02,590
Helia okay.
