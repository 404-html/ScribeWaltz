1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,270
These are great fucking

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,890
[inaudible].
We go,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,290
here we go again.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,570
We're so bad.
I just realized that,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,260
oh,
it's probably do something to stop that

6
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:20,530
while we're doing the podcast.
Great Dude.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,930
We Archer today.
We are church.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,520
I don't think that's the right way to
say it.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,593
We,
uh,

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,790
we are,
it was so fun.

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,210
So addicted to it now to archery.
You're like a legitimate archer.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,781
No.
Yeah,

13
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:36,520
you are.
You have like a full set up.

14
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:38,230
You do it all the time.
You practicing your,

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,090
it's incredibly addictive,
man.

16
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:41,690
It's,
it's,

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,523
it's,
uh,

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,440
very satisfying and it's a great God
damn metaphor for everything.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,580
Thank you,
sir.

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,540
Dunkin's doing the traditional way.
He's got the wooden Arrow shafts and the

21
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:59,030
traditional recurve bow,
which by the way,

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,810
anytime I post a picture of archery or
something like that,

23
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:03,980
you get that.
If you know,

24
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,590
using traditional bill,
you're,

25
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,311
yeah,
you're doing it.

26
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:08,110
The manway.

27
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,450
Well,
I'm traditionally missing the fucking

28
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:11,284
target too.

29
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,240
Some guys hunt like that,
which when you,

30
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,080
uh,
I mean there's guys that are obviously

31
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,140
way better at that shit than you or I,
but when you think about like what you

32
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:29,300
were shooting,
how you are shooting today and how I was

33
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:34,070
shooting both today and imagine trying
to hit an animal,

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,870
like maybe even a moving animal.

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,740
It's nuts.
I mean you're using what you're shooting

36
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:43,010
with doesn't even look like a bow.
It looks like some something that fell

37
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:47,900
out of a diamond shaped spaceship.
It's really weird.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,060
It's a very weird looking bow.
Whereas like my bow basic robin hood

39
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:56,000
style recurve bow,
but I get it,

40
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:59,390
man.
I would not want to hunt an animal with

41
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:02,620
a recurve bow because it seems like it
would be inhumane.

42
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,930
Like it seems that unless you're,
if you're going to kill something,

43
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:09,110
be very precise about it.
And I'm sure people with recurve bows

44
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:10,100
though,
of course,

45
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,210
if they eve shot your whole life,
it is precise I guess.

46
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:13,390
Yeah,

47
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,260
they could be probably close to as
precise as I am with uh,

48
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,270
a compound bow.
But not for like long distances.

49
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,460
It's,
it's a really can't cover the same kind

50
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:27,550
of distance I can shoot.
Like we were shooting today.

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,500
Well I shot that elk target at 65 yards
and I was putting it in the heart at 65

52
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,350
yards.
That would be really,

53
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,250
really hard to do.

54
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,590
Recurve bow and Leon.
Yeah,

55
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,500
you'd have to have a very powerful bow
to do that.

56
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:43,340
I mean,
that's a big,

57
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,320
seems to be part of the problem though.
I,

58
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,940
you know,
I don't know anything about it.

59
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,500
Like I just,
you know,

60
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,320
I,
I remember after the last podcast we

61
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:53,540
did,
you show me your bow and then that kind

62
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,220
of floated around in my head a little
bit.

63
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:55,581
Like,
man,

64
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:57,980
that'd be cool to start shooting.
Then I've,

65
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:59,150
you know,
now I have a yard.

66
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,183
So

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,830
the other day I went out and was like
doing yard work.

68
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:03,521
Like,
you know,

69
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,580
like would you've raking leaves and weed
eating and all this shit.

70
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:10,360
I hate on shit man.
Shit stuff I hated when I was a kid.

71
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,150
But now it's the,
it's the best.

72
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,120
Something clicks inside of you where
it's just like,

73
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:19,300
this is all I want to do.
I just want to weed eat.

74
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,510
I just want to us
that's,

75
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,940
that's being in your forties is where
you're like,

76
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,390
I was like vacuuming up the leaves.
Like the leaf blower,

77
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,270
you could reverse it and suck leaves
into a bag and it's just like,

78
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:34,000
my God,
this is heaven.

79
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,490
It's your place.
So when you have a place and it has a

80
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:39,590
nice yard,
you,

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,350
you know like lawn maintenance and stuff
like that has always been something that

82
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:44,670
men get into.
Yeah.

83
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,950
It's why they're always yelling at kid,
get out of my fucking Lord,

84
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,050
you know,
meet Milton.

85
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,180
People are duck old man gets mad when
you're on his lawn while you're messing

86
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:54,900
up.
His art is precious art is Zen sand

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,550
castle.
That's in that zen sandbox then that

88
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:01,470
people do where they just comb the sand
perfectly.

89
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:02,190
Yeah,

90
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,630
yeah.
Now that's very interesting.

91
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:06,030
You know,
that that process of like being in the

92
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:08,280
moment and then,
you know,

93
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,170
doing anything in the moment is
incredible.

94
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:11,880
But I've,
I've,

95
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,420
I spent a long time not going outside
enough and that is a really fucking

96
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,550
awful thing that can happen to you where
you just forget about outside.

97
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:28,020
Like outside is the place between your
house and your car or your car and your

98
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,030
office.
And that's outside.

99
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,850
But,
and so when you're not outside and

100
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,680
you're living inside the artificial
cave,

101
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,710
you're cutting yourself off from a very
specific field of data that it starts

102
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:43,860
teaching you.
If you're out there in it at all for any

103
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:44,940
amount of time,
it's,

104
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,460
it's a narcotic.
It's like Ow,

105
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,310
this is,
I've been inside so much that I feel

106
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:54,420
when I go outside,
like I've taken a vicodin or something.

107
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:55,410
It feels that good.

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,650
Is this like during the dark days of
video game addiction?

109
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,630
Oh yeah,
man.

110
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,441
Yeah.
This is,

111
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:02,400
uh,
yeah,

112
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:02,730
it's,
yeah.

113
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,070
Video Game Addiction,
Internet addiction.

114
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,460
Just a general feeling that,
that the outside is just,

115
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,020
you just don't do it.
You're just in too much,

116
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,890
you know?
So I think it's a,

117
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,090
it's so many people are afflicted by
this,

118
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:22,980
that you get so disconnected from this
rhythm that's out there,

119
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,410
that when you finally start feeling it
again,

120
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:29,580
it's like eating something when you
haven't been eating in a long time or

121
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:32,760
drinking something.
You just want to stay out there and feel

122
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,890
it.
So I,

123
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:35,560
yeah,
I got the,

124
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,200
Oh,
because I knew I'd put me outside more,

125
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,790
you know,
I've got to let these people know that

126
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,850
we're alive.
I didn't tweet it to me one second here,

127
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:43,870
but,
um,

128
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,240
what,
what made you decide to get that kind of

129
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:49,510
a bow or did you have someone help you?
Did you go to an archery place or how'd

130
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:49,920
you do it?

131
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,510
Yeah,
I went to an archery place.

132
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,280
Um,
and the,

133
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:54,360
and the guy,
you know,

134
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,620
the guys show me compound bows,
but you know,

135
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,190
it as far as I'm concerned,
if you're not shooting a recurve bow,

136
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:03,260
you're not really shooting.
You're not a man.

137
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,150
You're not a man.
So,

138
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,761
no,
I,

139
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:07,970
I just,
the compound bows,

140
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,530
man,
that's a commitment.

141
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,740
It looks like too much of a commitment.
There's too much going on there.

142
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,560
It's a serious thing.
It looks like it's for hunting.

143
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:20,450
I don't intend to go hunting.
I just want to stand outside shooting

144
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,490
and with a little poodle sits by the
pool and watches me and I just shoot

145
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:27,530
arrows and it's a fucking blast.
I love it.

146
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,120
But,
so this guy,

147
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,660
this kid,
uh,

148
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,690
he was like a are arched who's like done
archery his entire life.

149
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,400
I know nothing about this fucking thing,
but I hope I don't seem like I'm an

150
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,170
expert on our eye.
It's like no two weeks,

151
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,860
two week obsession.
So this kid is like explaining it to me

152
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,320
about uh,
you know,

153
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,630
the difference between a recurve bow and
a compound bow.

154
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,800
And he said basically a compound bow.
Everything's better than a recurve bow,

155
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,390
but a recurve bows a great way to learn.
So I get this recurve bow,

156
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,360
the little bastard sells me the wrong
fucking arrows,

157
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,480
which I didn't even find out.
He sold me compound bows arrows.

158
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:09,710
And so like I was shooting with those
for awhile and each of them would be

159
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:14,711
precisely off and the exact same place
because compound bow arrows are there,

160
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,260
plastic,
vinyl,

161
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:23,120
whatever that shit is.
So when they hit the bow they at least

162
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:27,680
when they hit a recurve bow and they hit
the arrow rest if throws them off in a

163
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,020
specific way where its feathers are more
pliable.

164
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,520
This is what somebody explained to me
after I went back and my sons these

165
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,301
other areas.
But man,

166
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:35,810
it's,
it's a,

167
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,030
it's an addiction.
It's expensive.

168
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,440
You keep wanting to buy shit and add
stuff on to it and upgrade.

169
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,690
It's really,
really fun though.

170
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,300
Will the compound bows even more
addictive because there's different

171
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,260
kinds of sites and different kind of
rests in,

172
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:52,700
there's drop away rest and there's
whisker biscuits and has all these diff

173
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,230
whisker biscuits.
Yeah,

174
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,170
it's like a bunch of different fibers
than your Arrow sits on.

175
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:00,130
So instead of arrest us,
so like a lot of people have a rest is

176
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:04,370
called a drop away.
Rest meaning as you release the Arrow,

177
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,030
the cables and the strings to the rest
are attached.

178
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,610
So as you were drawn back.
Yeah,

179
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,760
the rest is up and your arrows sitting
on the rest.

180
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,790
As you release the rest drops.
And so the Arrow takes off on the string

181
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,470
without the resistance of the rest being
there.

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,660
It's cool.
It just launches it in the air.

183
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,840
That's a whisker biscuit.
So that's the kind where it's a bunch of

184
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:31,550
fibers,
which over long periods of time can like

185
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:35,390
long distances,
can slightly affect the amount of feet

186
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,770
per second,
not much,

187
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:40,100
but like two or three seconds,
two or three feet per second over the

188
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,470
course of like 40 yards or something
like that,

189
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,360
which is,
you know,

190
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,540
you're talking about the difference
between like 288 feet per second,

191
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,190
285 feet per second.

192
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,700
Like it doesn't matter.
It's still insanely fast and powerful.

193
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,680
So that's some,
some people like Dattocon that whisker

194
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,040
biscuit

195
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,440
con,
but mine is the one that drops away.

196
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,640
It's so cool that this thing has evolved
to this point.

197
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,300
That crazy amazing,
right?

198
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,200
Crazy.
Now all the different evolutions that

199
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:11,700
the bow has had from the moment somebody
realized if you take a tight string and

200
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,130
put it between sticks and pull it back,
well you know,

201
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:17,880
yours is a recurve and a recurve is a
totally different thing.

202
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,720
That's,
that was like the original compound

203
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:21,140
book,
right?

204
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,050
It was the original technology because
they figured because of the curve of the

205
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:28,650
way your bow is designed that you can
generate much more power that way.

206
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,030
The regular kind of long bows,
that was the old school kind that you've

207
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,130
seen like the Robin Hood days and shit
like that.

208
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,840
But the recurve was like the Mongols,
like someone around that time figured

209
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:43,610
out how to make that and they made these
bows with um,

210
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,370
insanely powerful would and they used
animal horn and all kinds of other shit

211
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:52,200
and they,
they made some glues and one of the

212
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:55,530
things with their glues was when it was
raining out,

213
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:59,010
they couldn't fight right there fucking
Bozo and fall apart.

214
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,210
Right.
It was so cute.

215
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,400
It was pouring rain.
They had to get the fuck out of dodge

216
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,560
dude.
Their bowls would fall apart.

217
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:07,420
If the paste and shit they have holding
them together,

218
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:08,520
it got wet.
Right.

219
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,960
That's so weird.

220
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:17,210
There's so many things that throughout
history there's so many unknown people

221
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,290
who figured out these amazing things.
Like someone figured out how to advance

222
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,840
the boat to the point that it became a
long boat.

223
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:31,680
Like someone worked that and before that
someone just figure to me all of these

224
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:36,480
little moments in history are so
interesting and so frustrating because

225
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:40,110
most of them,
you'll never witness that moment.

226
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,350
Like the moment somebody made fire,
that's a thing.

227
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,950
You'll never see that one because
someone had to do at first.

228
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,800
Now maybe people did it all over the
planet at the same time.

229
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:52,350
Or if there are people over the planet
depending on which,

230
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,390
uh,
which uh,

231
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:56,720
explanation for how people got her.
If you've,

232
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,770
you've,
I think Hancock believes people were

233
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,960
spread out way before,
uh,

234
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,140
the out of Africa theory.
Right?

235
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:07,050
But anyway,
someone somewhere figured out how to do

236
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:07,220
it.

237
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,550
So they probably saw something happen
that caused a fire and then they tried

238
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,200
to recreate it until they were
successful.

239
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,850
At the moment they were successful.
The mind,

240
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,300
the imagine the fucking look on the
guy's face.

241
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,430
The first car that figured out he can
make fire on his own.

242
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,200
Yeah,
like the first guy that you used one of

243
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:26,100
those bose with the bits and the tkc
knows we use two hands that the real

244
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,980
hardcore guys,
they use a bow with a bit in their

245
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,140
teeth.
So they put the bit in their teeth and

246
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,610
then there's a stick,
right?

247
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,120
And then they have the boat and because
of that they can use two hands.

248
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,770
So they're clamping down on the bit.
They go like this.

249
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,290
You just see it starts smoking.
He was a guy that was on one of those

250
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,750
crazy mountain men shows.
I don't know which one it was,

251
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:52,560
but one of those shows where dudes are
living alone and the fucking life below

252
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:53,680
zero.
That's who it was.

253
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,740
It was the,
the guy in life below zero who lives by

254
00:11:56,741 --> 00:12:01,741
himself in like a tool shed is like this
tiny little shack in Alaska where he's

255
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:06,790
miles and miles and miles from
civilization and for most of the year

256
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:11,200
this guy lives like this where he just
subsist off the land by himself.

257
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,590
He just eats Caribou.
He has to fend wolves off of his

258
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:17,720
property.
He and he doesn't bring matches with

259
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:20,020
them because you could always run out of
matches.

260
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,450
He wants to be able to make a fire
consistently on his own.

261
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,620
So he brings this bit and the bow.

262
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,680
That's how he starts his fires.
That's cool.

263
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,660
It's the sane,
it's super cool.

264
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,120
Insane.
Have you seen the youtube primitive

265
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,380
technology channel?
It's really great.

266
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,200
It's so bad ass.
It's like a guy,

267
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,450
I don't know where he is.
He's somewhere where there's a lot of

268
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:40,360
mud and trees and he and he,
he like,

269
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,960
he shows how to construct a tiled roofed
hut just using mud and fire.

270
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:52,351
Like he built his own kiln and he can
bake his own tiles and Whoa,

271
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,550
check this guy out.
It's really cool.

272
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,050
No,
no talking either.

273
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,870
He just shows how it's done step by
step.

274
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,660
Yeah.
But he's a bad ass man.

275
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,720
That guy is really cool and that kind of
stuff is amazing.

276
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,230
It's amazing to know.
It's the foundational,

277
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:09,220
you know,
amazing.

278
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,890
When you find one guy who is cause it's
fucking blisters.

279
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,650
She's just [inaudible] his hands.
So he's just showing you everything.

280
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,290
That's so interesting.
He's not saying a word right now.

281
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,320
He doesn't say anything now.
It's just like,

282
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,380
here's the kind of rocky is,
it's an awesome skill to have.

283
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,810
It really is.
But you know what the fucking problem

284
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:28,480
with this kind of privative shit is,
and I don't want to sound like,

285
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,963
like,
um,

286
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,930
pessimistic,
but oftentimes if it's down to using

287
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:38,410
this kind of stuff,
I mean this is what we're back down to.

288
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,400
We're fucked you mom.
You almost don't want to make it.

289
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,260
She'll,
I mean it's the way the human race is

290
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,270
depicted in that movie.
The road.

291
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,780
Yes.
It's probably real close to how it would

292
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:53,740
go down.
Well,

293
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:56,140
look at the way life was during the
black play.

294
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,150
You know,
it's,

295
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,090
it was like that.
There was a semi apocalypse that swept

296
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,420
around the planet and people became
insane.

297
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,670
They thought ringing bells would cure
it.

298
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,970
People slide very quickly away from the
land of logic and science when shit gets

299
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:14,650
weird.
Well not only that,

300
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:17,080
the logic,
the word of logic and science is only

301
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:20,110
connected through electricity and the
electricity goes out.

302
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:23,620
That logic and science goes with it and
you get back the same kind of bullshit

303
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,750
and it used to have in the 80s when
dudes are like,

304
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,840
you know what I her bro,
I heard there's a fucking page

305
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,250
underneath the Penthouse,
right?

306
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,610
They could go right to the moon,
bro.

307
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:31,720
They just press a button.
It shoot,

308
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:33,820
went up to the mat and he told you that
my uncle,

309
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:37,360
my uncle worked for the secret service.
He's deep inside the heart of darkness.

310
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,900
Those were the days,
the days people would just make shit up.

311
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,040
They just made shit up.
But when people today do not understand

312
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,200
how much of a fucking problem that was
when we were growing up,

313
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,230
these people that would just make up
crazy stories,

314
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:51,680
you know,
like is that guy I him the truth,

315
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,950
like everybody could lie.
Back then it was so hard to get busted.

316
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,650
You could pretend you are a nom guys
would pretend they were numb all the

317
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,330
time.
It's right there would make up some

318
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:04,730
crazy fake military history.
Yeah.

319
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,410
That was super common,
man.

320
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:09,020
No way to investigate someone super
common.

321
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,860
You have to hire a private eye.
Yeah.

322
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,510
Especially if a guy like read a book and
like knew a lot about the time period.

323
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,950
If he was a real efficient.
Yeah,

324
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,380
yeah.
You know?

325
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,340
So then how much more so way,
way,

326
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:22,810
way back.
You know,

327
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:27,811
and people like didn't understand.
This is why magicians are so powerful

328
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:28,781
back then.
Like,

329
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:32,560
if you could do,
imagine sending just a classic street

330
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:37,561
magician back in time a few thousand
years who can do that stuff in front of

331
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:41,200
people who haven't,
who still believe that earth is flat,

332
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,030
but he can like,
you know,

333
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,360
do basic coin magic.
Yeah.

334
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,730
That person's going to seem like a god.
That person's going to seem like

335
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,210
warlock.
Yeah.

336
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,973
Yeah.
There's,

337
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,640
there's very few people that are alive
today that we can't,

338
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,240
I don't even think we could
intellectualize what life was like back

339
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:04,460
when no one could read.
All right.

340
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,040
Well how about like what life was like
when,

341
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,640
you know,
before the Bible was translated,

342
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,210
when you had to have priests do all the
translating and no one could read it.

343
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,100
Yeah.
That was a real issue.

344
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,630
Yeah.
If you ever see that he listened to that

345
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:20,300
Dan Carlin podcast on that.
No.

346
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,670
It's a,
the rise of,

347
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:26,360
um,
lutherism and Martin Luther and Martin

348
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,120
Luther being one of the first guys who
translated it phonetically.

349
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,101
And that,
uh,

350
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:33,230
when he did,
there was all sorts of fucking crazy

351
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:37,550
chaos going on where people were all of
a sudden not needing the priest to

352
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:40,370
interpret the word of God anymore.
And you could read it for yourself.

353
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,180
And not only that,
he was saying this was the most blast

354
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:45,710
from this thing of all.
He was saying that you could determine

355
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:48,950
for yourself what God meant in these
passages,

356
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:50,390
that it was up to like,
as a,

357
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,570
as a man,
you could read God's word and determined

358
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:55,770
through and they were like,
what the fuck are you saying?

359
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,780
You're ruining our fucking king.
I mean,

360
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:03,890
can you imagine the Bible was only in a
language that they could read?

361
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,630
That's right.
It wasn't in German.

362
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,100
Yeah.
And so all of these people,

363
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,990
like under the thumb of this weird thing
that was connected to God.

364
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,241
Yeah.
And we're,

365
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,500
you know,
we're still under it that,

366
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,790
that thumb,
because the,

367
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:20,791
you know,
the Bible now is silicide been the Bible

368
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:23,890
now is lsd.
The viable now are all these wonderful

369
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:28,891
psychedelics that a very small group of
people have controlled for a really long

370
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:31,060
time.
But when you have a nice psychedelic

371
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:33,370
experience,
your reading,

372
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,710
the word of God,
if you ask me,

373
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,390
and it's,
this is the thing where,

374
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,450
um,
you can have a direct connection with

375
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:42,250
it.
You don't need anybody there to

376
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:45,850
interpret or translate it.
You just have a nice chat with the

377
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:49,830
universe and there are people who want
to us

378
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,180
now for having that conversation in the
same way that you could probably get

379
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:58,950
arrested at some point for have reading
the Bible or you could worse than that,

380
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:02,280
you get murdered for it if you didn't,
if you didn't have the right

381
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,770
credentials,
if you hadn't gone through the right

382
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:06,960
initiation.
Yeah,

383
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,420
same thing.
It never changes many,

384
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,030
it never changes.
Anytime there's an information stream,

385
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,690
there's always a group of cons,
doing everything they can to control it.

386
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,180
Always.
It's so true.

387
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,310
It's so true always.
And you know,

388
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:21,390
they say,
they will say,

389
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,090
no,
this is not,

390
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,240
you know,
the prohibition on psychedelics is not

391
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:25,890
what you think hippie.
This isn't done.

392
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:29,760
Because when people take psychedelics,
they recognize that there's some major

393
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:33,390
flaws in the concept of money.
And maybe it isn't the best thing to

394
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,060
sell your life energy,
uh,

395
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,090
for the majority of her life to somebody
to make way less money than you deserve

396
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:42,960
for selling the life energy of a being.

397
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,300
That as far as we know,
is completely unique,

398
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,340
at least in this galaxy.
If not,

399
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,920
and I mean planets are relatively
unique.

400
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:53,160
So if you're a being on a planet that's
aware of itself,

401
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:56,250
you're a pretty special thing as far as
our understanding of the universe goes.

402
00:18:56,251 --> 00:19:00,520
So your life energy per hours actually
super pro,

403
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,070
probably $1 billion an hour is what
anybody's life energy is really worth.

404
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,090
So anyway,
the whole point is you started taking,

405
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,850
it's a great point.
That's the,

406
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,320
that's the key to life is key to life is
to value your time,

407
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,480
right?
Acute to life is to value your time and

408
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:18,420
try as much as you can to direct it
towards things you love.

409
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,370
Being with people you love,
doing things you love right.

410
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,440
And recognize that the more you do that,
you have to compromise.

411
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:29,580
The more you do where you were only
doing it for a paycheck or you're only

412
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:34,020
doing it because you want a play it safe
or you're only doing it for any,

413
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,540
any what it out,
whatever the negative reason would be.

414
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,150
Anytime you're doing anything like that,
you're wasting time.

415
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,490
Yeah.
It's wasting the most precious thing you

416
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:42,420
can have.
Yeah.

417
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,590
Theoretically,
I mean,

418
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,400
this seems to be a very rare,
and I'm this book,

419
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,410
you gotta read this book,
Bill Bryson,

420
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,370
a brief history of nearly everything.
That's when you were talking about

421
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,790
today.
Holy Shit Man.

422
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,290
When like his,
you know,

423
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,510
he's just very good at taking this,
you know,

424
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:00,200
some pretty dense ideas than writing it
down.

425
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,170
Like,
I'm going to prepare to read.

426
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,790
I'm going to pretend I'm going to read
it or not.

427
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,800
You lie.
I,

428
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,360
you'll read this.
This one's history of nearly everything.

429
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,040
Yeah.
I would put this one.

430
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,940
This is as good as like the archaic
revival or it's not about psychedelics,

431
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:15,120
but it's is it's psychedelic.
Just because it's,

432
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:19,410
he's so good at um,
articulating this shit that's incredibly

433
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:21,000
difficult to understand.
You know,

434
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:21,834
like,
uh,

435
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,230
the,
the gravity,

436
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,330
you know,
gravity being the of you know what

437
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:27,900
gravity is.

438
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,610
Do you know what gravity is?
Not really.

439
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,870
So it makes the earth really sticky.
So yeah,

440
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:38,871
that's the Martin larger the planet is
the more mass the planet has,

441
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:42,600
the stronger the gravity polos.
That's why the moon is one six.

442
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:45,810
Earth's gravity.
Mars is wa it was like one half or one

443
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,380
quarter.
I was right though.

444
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,450
I'm not going to say right,
like I know I'm going to say,

445
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:50,000
right.
Like I,

446
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,420
I imagine Mars is less,
it's there.

447
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,300
Those are issues like that they have to
deal with when they go into space and

448
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:58,180
they don't have gravity,
their bones get all fucked up.

449
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,100
So what's happening here according now,
anyone out there as a scientist,

450
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,070
I do not think of myself as a scientist.
I'm wait,

451
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,530
what about that shit you were saying
earlier today?

452
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:09,310
Man,
I'm on the show.

453
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,980
I was a scientist.
Fuck Bro.

454
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,640
So yeah,
I like it.

455
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,810
Let's get surprise.
Anybody.

456
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,820
I just don't want the inevitable like
Schwartz,

457
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,370
well,
we're just talking when he's talking.

458
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,560
So in this book it says that what
gravity is is you get this incredibly

459
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,230
heavy thing,
I think with a lot of mass and the mass

460
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,470
pushes in to the time space continuum.
And so it's like they compare it to like

461
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:40,360
putting a lead ball and a mattress.
It creates an indentation and gravity is

462
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:43,600
actually the indentation and it's in
time space.

463
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,560
And so that's why like if you roll a
ball towards,

464
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:49,000
uh,
um,

465
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,490
uh,
like if you put a kettle bell on your

466
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:54,990
mattress and roll a ball towards it,
it'll start falling towards the kettle

467
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:56,890
bell.
And that's what planets are doing.

468
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:01,300
They're falling towards or they're
trapped in this sort of indentation

469
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,980
created.
Great way of putting it.

470
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,860
Yeah.
Really small heavyweight in the center

471
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:09,490
of the mattress and everything's gets
sucked into its wig.

472
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,650
That's it.
That's the most psychedelic thing.

473
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,341
Oh,
there it is.

474
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:12,731
Oh,
cool.

475
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,570
Yeah.
Check this out.

476
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:16,060
This is it.
This explains gravity.

477
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,590
I have another object.
It also works spacetime.

478
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,620
They feel that and they're attracted to
each other.

479
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,640
And so that's,
that's Einstein's picture of grabbing

480
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,610
objects,
workspace eyes,

481
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,450
feel that curvature and move
accordingly.

482
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:40,310
And if you have more mass,
more mass,

483
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:47,320
it's going to fence based spacetime
more.

484
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:56,120
We're looking at a like a trampoline.
It's look like a impromptu trampoline

485
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:59,460
that they've made with it looks like a
tablecloth or something.

486
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:04,461
We just stretched over this whole a rim
and they're dropping things in the

487
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:06,050
center.
So that's what they're talking about.

488
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:10,430
This is probably like a little too
visual to really get across at all.

489
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,040
Yeah.
But that's pretty good description.

490
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,840
It's a trampoline with a heavy thing in
the middle.

491
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:17,360
And this guy's like dropping marbles on
it.

492
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,950
Yeah.
And he's showing how everything's

493
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,820
getting sucked into the center and
that's gravity visualized and it's,

494
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,440
that's the name of it on Youtube.
Yeah.

495
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:25,670
Grab.
But so,

496
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,730
so all of this stuff,
like in the introduction price,

497
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:32,790
it's like he's,
I think he said he was on a ship or he's

498
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,910
flying over the ocean and he's,
he's like,

499
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:36,770
I don't,
I don't know how big the earth is.

500
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,870
I don't know how much water's in the
ocean.

501
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,500
I don't know how far away the moon is.
He realized he didn't know any of this

502
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,990
shit and so he's,
he started

503
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,720
all of these things in interviewing all
of these cosmologist and physicist and

504
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:54,680
then he took it all and put it in a
really understandable way like he cut

505
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:59,540
through because a lot of this stuff is
so dense like newtons.

506
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Newton wrote what is considered to be
one of the most famous texts on fit,

507
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,530
I guess physics called the Principia.
I don't know.

508
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,450
You can look it up.
The principia something,

509
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,540
but he intends intentionally made it
difficult.

510
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,930
It's considered to be bryce and says
it's one of the most difficult books to

511
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:20,390
read.
And he did that because he wanted to

512
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:24,950
separate the real mathematicians and
scientists from everybody else.

513
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:28,670
He didn't want normal people to have
access to this information.

514
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,930
But yeah,
it is the philosophy naturalist

515
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:36,931
Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton.
That guy was a fucking freak man.

516
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,870
There were,
it was,

517
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,120
he was nuts.
They were trying to figure out,

518
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,180
um,
they,

519
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,011
they,
Oh god,

520
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:45,130
there was some equation that they didn't
understand.

521
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,640
They got,
what was it?

522
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:49,880
They were trying to figure out shit.
Well,

523
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:51,050
there,
back then they're trying to figure out

524
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,430
everything.
How big is the earth?

525
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,640
What is the,
they were trying to figure out what y

526
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:58,910
planets,
the moon moves in the ellipses or

527
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:02,810
something like the way planets move.
And so they've been working on this

528
00:25:02,811 --> 00:25:04,340
forever.
Forgive me again,

529
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:05,360
you guys,
I'm sure I'm butchering,

530
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:07,520
but I'm doing my best.
And like this,

531
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,354
uh,
this,

532
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,140
uh,
famous mathematician goes to see Isaac

533
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,810
Newton and asked him about this problem
that they'd been working on forever.

534
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,160
And he's like,
Oh yes,

535
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:20,270
I've already solved it and
what it did.

536
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,250
And then there were like,
the guys like,

537
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:23,600
well,
show it to us and he's like,

538
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:26,000
no problem.
And he goes and he's got stacks and

539
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:31,001
stacks of paper and he can't find it
like it's lost somewhere among his

540
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:32,090
papers.

541
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,470
But he inevitably find,
found it.

542
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:35,030
Now here's what's weird about fucking
Newton,

543
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,640
aside from the fact that he,
uh,

544
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,950
never had sex.
No.

545
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,391
Well,
no,

546
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:39,560
he never had sex.
That's right.

547
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,470
And then do you know that he's studied
the Temple of Solomon?

548
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:44,600
Did you know he's into that shit?
He was into alchemy.

549
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,780
But what did that mean back then back
then?

550
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:52,220
We now look at it as like old retarded
shit that people did when they were

551
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:55,700
trying to like make gold out of lead and
use witchcraft to shit like that.

552
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,440
Not Witchcraft,
but no,

553
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,590
I mean an alchemist you think of almost
as a magician,

554
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,000
don't you?
Well,

555
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,220
I mean the an alchemist I think of as
early,

556
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,620
it's an early chemist.
It's another name for chemists.

557
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:07,910
So it's,
a lot of it was bullshit,

558
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:09,530
right?
Like a lot of it was,

559
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,101
well,
I mean,

560
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:10,970
here's the thing.

561
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,640
This is Newton,
Isaac Newton,

562
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:18,170
one of the most famous minds ever who
discovered all of this shit when he's

563
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:21,590
surrounded.
Now what we were talking about earlier,

564
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,700
the liars and people who just make shit
up back then.

565
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,260
You're like Isaac Newton surrounded by
these people who will kill you if you

566
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,960
make the wrong discovery and say it in
the wrong way though.

567
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:36,560
That's the level of you are surrounded
by idiots on all sides,

568
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,780
like idiots,
unlike any idiot that we've ever

569
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:40,880
encountered.
It's not their fault that they're

570
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,440
idiots.
They just don't have the information.

571
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,740
So studying these out chemical texts,
you're studying this really weird

572
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,210
ancient stuff and from that you come up
with all this stuff that turns out to be

573
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:55,740
real.
I think Isaac Newton figured something

574
00:26:55,741 --> 00:27:00,000
out studying the Temple of Solomon.
I think it probably added to his,

575
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,720
uh,
understanding of a math somehow that's

576
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:08,190
some sacred geometry is in there that I
couldn't possibly hope to understand.

577
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,180
But look,
man,

578
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:14,160
if this is the guy who like figured out
so many of the things that we still use

579
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,920
today,
if he's studying the Temple of Solomon,

580
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,620
I'm not going to,
I think there's something,

581
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,700
there must be something to it.

582
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,780
Oh,
at something.

583
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,340
What?
In what way?

584
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,080
Like it's Jeanette,
some sort of a,

585
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,800
an encoding of information and the
architecture.

586
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,050
Sure.
Yeah,

587
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:31,150
definitely.
Like so maybe somewhere in there,

588
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:31,890
there was some,

589
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,040
well they definitely did that in Egypt.
Have you ever seen some of the

590
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,660
breakdowns of the,
uh,

591
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,900
the temples,
the various temples and what they're,

592
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,600
especially the temple of man?
Yeah.

593
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,650
If you ever seen the breakdowns of that.
I've heard you talk about it.

594
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:46,470
I haven't signed on right now.
Forget me.

595
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,860
John Anthony West is the guy,
if you're interested in it at all.

596
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,480
He's got this,
uh,

597
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,590
series on Egypt called magical Egypt and
apparently he just released magical

598
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,620
Egypt to which,
uh,

599
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,483
the guys,
uh,

600
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,100
he is like one of the most knowledgeable
guys when it comes to the history of

601
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:02,731
Egypt.
I mean,

602
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:06,210
he's amazing.
He's just so engrossed in it that people

603
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:09,270
don't take them that seriously because
he,

604
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,580
I don't think he has a masters or a phd
in it.

605
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,770
I think he's just a guy.
He's been obsessed with it.

606
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:15,240
So he's been studying it forever.

607
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,060
But he knows so much about it.
And when you,

608
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,100
when you're watching what he's saying,
along with just the videos of the

609
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,040
temples,
where he's describing all the different

610
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,790
types of art work and the way they
constructed it and how,

611
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,340
you know,
if it's basically just constructed

612
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:36,360
around the FIBONACCI sequence,
so the entire building is mathematic.

613
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,370
We sequenced the same way like a human
body as like the proportions of the

614
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:42,540
human body.
Right.

615
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,860
It's really fucking intense.
Like they were so fucking smart,

616
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,360
man.
I just think it's almost in the evidence

617
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,720
of how incredibly smart they were to
build these just insane buildings that

618
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:02,540
are still insane today.
And they did them 2,500 years BC.

619
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,121
Yeah.
I'm like,

620
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:05,250
what the fuck?
Where people like back then,

621
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:05,731
man.
Right.

622
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:08,940
What happened?
How did they go from that to trailer

623
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:09,740
parks?
How,

624
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,900
how was the same people that can build
the temple of Giza?

625
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,810
How are they the same people that are
about to elect Donald Trump?

626
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,800
Right?
What,

627
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,510
how was that?
What happened?

628
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,530
What's,
what's going on with human beings?

629
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:22,380
Like is this like,
uh,

630
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,360
some of them reach these insanely high
frequencies and the rest just eat their

631
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:29,080
ankles while they're fucking trying to
climb them?

632
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,970
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

633
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,920
I mean there's all kinds of like,
if you look at like the,

634
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,080
uh,
and I think it's in China.

635
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:38,150
These are,
you know about the thumb monkeys.

636
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,820
Have you seen these dumb monkeys?
Oh,

637
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,183
you can buy these

638
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,410
tiny little sweeties.
They're tiny.

639
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:45,820
They're silky danger though,
right?

640
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,631
Oh yeah.
It's bad.

641
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,370
He shouldn't have a thumb monkey.
I don't,

642
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,240
of course they're fucking endangered.
They're the size of their tiny.

643
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,510
How are they not in danger to us?
My sergeant ditch all,

644
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:57,270
they're so cute.
The monkeys.

645
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,870
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

646
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,410
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

647
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,020
Hold on.
Wait a minute.

648
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,310
What we need to do is just save these
and everybody has these as pets or what?

649
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,420
For endangered.
What does this in dangerous,

650
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,440
throw some money at this problem.
How come I can't have a thumb monkey?

651
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,430
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why.

652
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,530
Because these assholes don't know how to
take care of them.

653
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,800
Bring them to America.
Where people loved on monkeys will take

654
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:25,540
care of them.
We'll breed them like crazy.

655
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:30,400
We'll give them all protein powder and
save the thumb monkey.

656
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,990
Yeah,
we'll give him vitamins and shit.

657
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,853
Let's do a bed.
Mom.

658
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
Look at that cute little face.
Dude.

659
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:37,450
I'm telling you we can do this.
Oh we have to do is get them to fuck.

660
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,290
We create like a gigantic thumb monkey
paradise.

661
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,780
Look animals you have to do,
they're safe.

662
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,280
They fuck.
Okay.

663
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,370
That's just what happens.
All you have to do is just get them

664
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:50,070
chilled out and they'll fuck the shit
out of me.

665
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,040
You could watch hours of thumb monkeys
fucking but they fuck only in the mouth.

666
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:56,380
That's the problem.
But so few of them like,

667
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:59,230
Hey assholes.
You keep fucking each other in the

668
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:00,830
mouth.
That's why there's only 10 of you.

669
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,320
You got to stick it in her pussy.
There's something about thumb monkey

670
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,200
pussy.
It's rotten and they don't just hang on

671
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,480
your thumb guaranteed.
So what we're going to have to do is

672
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:14,110
we're going to go let go in there and
jerk him off and get little vials of

673
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:14,350
thumb.

674
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,830
Monkey calm and just starts court and
then the females shirk off the thumb

675
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:18,371
monkeys.
Yeah.

676
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:21,760
That's the only way we can use them as
pets.

677
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,580
Yeah Man,
I've been jerking off thumb monkeys all

678
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:25,870
day.
I'm exhausted.

679
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,210
And then some people are going to find
out how delicious they are and then

680
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:30,250
we're going to have a real problem.
Perhaps people are going to be eating

681
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:31,750
thumb monkeys.
They like,

682
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:35,230
they like give you a little more energy
or they like the making young.

683
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,210
What if they found out they gave you a
six pack?

684
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:39,100
Eight a thumb monkey.
Just an inch bigger.

685
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:42,370
Every time you you're more fun monkeys.
No more thumb.

686
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:45,550
Mcgee's it'd be swarms if humans to
sending,

687
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,230
it'd be like that bit that I used to
have a big dick pills.

688
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,000
People will be coming out of the thumb
monkey forest or their mouth covered in

689
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:57,640
blood and fern,
it's one thing to like,

690
00:31:57,641 --> 00:32:01,960
we would not let you eat fellow primates
that we have rules in this country.

691
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,600
At least if you,
if you,

692
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,650
um,
if you can eat,

693
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,110
if you could prove that a pig as smarter
than a thumb monkey.

694
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,100
And it might be still okay to eat pigs
not attending your thumb monkey.

695
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:14,460
Even if it's stupid.
There's something about the little look

696
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:15,790
on his face when you go to grab it.
It's like,

697
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:17,020
yeah,
yeah.

698
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,290
If you can't,
you can't eat your own Chi,

699
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:21,430
man.
He keeps not even our own kind,

700
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:22,241
dude.
Well,

701
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:24,250
it looks close enough to close.
Right?

702
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,720
That's pretty close.
It's too close.

703
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,860
Close.
And,

704
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,761
but the point is,
man,

705
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:32,761
if you get that happening right,
and then why wouldn't it happen with

706
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:36,820
humans that like some humans are going
to divert,

707
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,310
some humans are going to vote for trump.
Some humans want to hear Isaac

708
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,370
fucking Newton talking about his goddamn
bullshit.

709
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,670
It's like sending in those humans
usually are really violent and that's

710
00:32:46,671 --> 00:32:51,620
why people like Isaac Newton end up
becoming very relatively reclusive.

711
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,940
They don't want to deal with these.
They're constantly dealing with people

712
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,380
who are idiots like idiots and who are
idiots.

713
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:04,850
It though like I'm an idiot,
but if someone corrects me and it seems

714
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:08,630
undeniable,
then I'll refine your completely

715
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:11,620
different kind of idiot than an idiot
from the 1400 right?

716
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,620
Yeah.
I'm a different idea,

717
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,560
like these idiots are like,
they will kill you,

718
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,470
they will imprison you,
they will incinerate you.

719
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,453
So

720
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,120
we're,
we're in nature,

721
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,350
we're idiots.
We're both idiots.

722
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,900
We're idiots in the age of information,
right?

723
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Like we're so much more informed today.
Even the dumb amongst us than anyone

724
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:32,330
that's ever lived there.
Any civilization ever.

725
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,060
If even the really brilliant people you
go to,

726
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:40,010
like you know Thomas Edison or someone,
if you had Thomas Edison alive today,

727
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,930
he would know Jack Shit about the way
this world works because there's too

728
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:49,790
much information that doesn't apply like
the you need today,

729
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,940
right?
That he just didn't have that few weeks.

730
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,100
He'd have a lot,
it wouldn't be a long time before he

731
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,810
totally understood what the fuck was
going on.

732
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,640
But my point being that you're talking
about people that were the most informed

733
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:06,590
people in the world during their time.
The regular person today is way more

734
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,960
informed than them on so many different
things.

735
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,050
Even if it's just instantaneously by
being connected to Google.

736
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,120
If they have the will to check.
There's more information now today than

737
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,350
your average dumb ass can just grab a
hold of it and use it for an argument

738
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,810
more an instant.
Right.

739
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,440
Then anybody that's ever live.
Yeah.

740
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,110
So all of these people that knew who is
dealing with,

741
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,680
oh my God,
how many of them even could read,

742
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,640
right.
How many,

743
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:36,260
how many of them just believe the most
unbelievably retarded shit and thought

744
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:38,060
there were demons waiting for him in the
woods.

745
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:40,430
Sure.
And thought that they had to do the will

746
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:43,190
of God.
Otherwise the apocalypse did sue and

747
00:34:43,191 --> 00:34:47,390
they have to lock up Galileo and make
sure he doesn't tell everybody that the

748
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:49,520
earth isn't the center of the universe.
Yeah.

749
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,690
Most of them,
man,

750
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:54,750
those guys get through when we're
complaining about a tweet or,

751
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,020
oh man,
I got so much fucking hate for this

752
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:57,640
tweet.

753
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,970
Yeah,
right.

754
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:04,210
Galileo got locked up for being right.
They put him in the house arrest.

755
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:08,570
What are the most brilliant astronomers
and when the most important people in

756
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:12,230
the world at the time for,
and maybe even ever when it comes to

757
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:15,890
getting the people to try to understand
the perspective of what we're dealing

758
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:17,630
with when we're looking up into the
heavens,

759
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,900
right?
That it's very possible that you're

760
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,760
looking at something that absolutely
doesn't have an end,

761
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,190
right.
This isn't something we can define and

762
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:30,191
it's proof positive that the pettiness
and nonsense that we wrestle with on a

763
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,440
day to day basis is a fucking fantastic
distraction from the eternity above our

764
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:38,070
heads at any given moment.

765
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,060
And this attorney that you're trying to
attach to a book that was clearly

766
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:45,270
written by people even fucking dumber
than us,

767
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,200
even less informed in us with less
information,

768
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,670
right?
More scared.

769
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,550
The oldest guy in the fucking tribe was
19 right?

770
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,530
Everybody's dead by the time they're 30
everybody's got gang green and malaria.

771
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,940
But you got to got eaten by a crocodile
and you got to distinguish though

772
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,470
information from navigation,
you know,

773
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:08,850
like,
so it's like you're,

774
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,930
you're in this dimension that you've got
to navigate through for a certain period

775
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:17,931
of time.
So the Bible or the Torah or whatever

776
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:21,120
their religious scripture is that you're
looking at,

777
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:27,660
it is the data in it.
As far as the age of the earth where

778
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:31,710
things came from.
A lot of that data is obviously

779
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,560
completely fucking wrong.
You could see how someone think of it.

780
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,150
It's like what a six year old might
think.

781
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,030
So,
but you could see a young version of

782
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,130
humanity would think these things that
makes sense,

783
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:46,131
but with like encased within all that
bad data or some pretty great

784
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:51,810
navigational tips.
So it's so you gotta be able to Unpeel

785
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:54,960
all the bad information and look deeper
and see if there's anything in there

786
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:56,480
that is like,
cause that,

787
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,840
cause when you were talking about uh,
not Newton who has it,

788
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:03,330
a Galileo,
if we brought him back here,

789
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:05,200
you would be confused on the set of Tom
Setting.

790
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,190
Yeah.
So I think a lot of these people have

791
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:13,191
developed a navigational techniques that
would work or did you would adapt,

792
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,990
should adapt quick.
And that's what's important.

793
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:17,690
It doesn't matter how much data you're
getting,

794
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,743
you know,
it's like,

795
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,630
this is what I love about archery is
that archery,

796
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,450
your dealing with data,
right?

797
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,210
You're dealing with,
so every time you fire an arrow,

798
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,900
you get an instantaneous feedback from
the target.

799
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,321
Right?
So,

800
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:32,790
you know,
here's where I'm off.

801
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:35,340
No question about it.
No arguing about it.

802
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,940
No matter how that is not the bullseye.
And I can clearly see that's not the

803
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:41,430
bullseye.
And so then you make adjustments,

804
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:42,211
right?
Oh,

805
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:43,980
okay.
So if I just move a little bit to the

806
00:37:43,981 --> 00:37:47,070
left that maybe I'll get closer to the
bullseye.

807
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,310
And I've noticed with archery,
my ego,

808
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,510
even when I will have me shoot the
heroin the exact same way,

809
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,580
even though I'm still off the fucking
target,

810
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,940
you know,
just say no,

811
00:37:57,941 --> 00:37:58,231
no,
no,

812
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:01,680
you were right at the Arrow was wrong.
That's how the brain works.

813
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:03,360
Like it fell right.
Just keep doing it.

814
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,590
So,
so,

815
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,320
so you've got to,
even though the feedback from the

816
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:08,520
universe is like nope,
wrong,

817
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,440
don't take that approach to bud fucking
ever.

818
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,360
You hurt somebody hurt somebody,
stop screaming,

819
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:17,160
I'm doing it right.
Yeah.

820
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,780
Right.
Exactly.

821
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:24,050
But think of it man.
So I certainly am in my life have erred

822
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,480
by choosing my instinct over the
feedback I'm getting from the universe

823
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:33,000
because I want,
and so because of that self sabotage,

824
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:35,830
self sabotage,
and then that mean

825
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,040
you are not,
you're not a terrible person with that.

826
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,870
You don't,
you don't have giant problems with that.

827
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:45,310
But you are like a lot of other
impulsive artists and that you're kind

828
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:48,460
of drawn towards that sometimes when you
don't have structure,

829
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,500
you can get chaotic with your freedom.
Yeah.

830
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,130
And sometimes your,
your freedom becomes a prison.

831
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,980
And a lot of ways because you don't
discipline yourself and you don't

832
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:59,440
necessarily have to write because you're
a comedian.

833
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:02,400
So a I fucking,
I don't have anything to do to that.

834
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,610
Right?
And then you're in front of that

835
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:06,700
computer and that game is there and you
just can get sucked into it.

836
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,580
Whereas a normal person with a normal
life is like,

837
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,710
hey,
I got shit I have to do in the morning.

838
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,350
Right?
Well this is like that right

839
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,070
book that you introduced me to,
which I war of art.

840
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,170
Now the book of five rings.
Oh,

841
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:21,470
the real ones.
And the one that talks about how uh,

842
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,350
you should just learn anything like get
good at anything.

843
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:26,300
It doesn't matter what the thing is that
you're getting good at.

844
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:28,760
Because if you understand how to get
good at this one thing,

845
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,660
you can extrapolate from that how to get
good at almost anything.

846
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,610
There's these recurring patterns that
happen.

847
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:39,170
And so with archery it's really cool
because you have to find these,

848
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,640
you have to keep all these variables the
same no matter what your environment,

849
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,150
if you can learn to keep these variables
the same if you're on a hill,

850
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,060
the distance when,
whatever,

851
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:52,490
if you can learn how to hold these
variables the same,

852
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,480
which is the anchor point,
the way your arm holds the bow,

853
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,620
the way you pull the Arrow back,
the way you release the air,

854
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,520
there's all these pieces in there and if
you can keep all of those the same or

855
00:40:04,521 --> 00:40:08,390
close to the same with adjustments based
on whatever your target app is to be,

856
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,980
then you're going to improve in your
accurate accuracy.

857
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:16,940
If you keep changing your variable,
if you keep moving your arm up or down

858
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:19,220
or like releasing in a different way or
whatever,

859
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:20,900
if any of these things are always
changing,

860
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:26,230
you won't be as accurate over time.
So from that you can grab that and look

861
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:29,420
at your life and realize like,
Oh shit man,

862
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,940
my wife,
I've just been readjusting all these

863
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:36,941
stupid variables over and over and over
again without just for at least a month,

864
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,110
attempting some rhythmic patterns,
some similar thing,

865
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:43,940
you know?
And when you start doing that,

866
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,180
it's really interesting because you
begin to,

867
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,350
um,
improve in a lot of an in everything in

868
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:52,101
general,
you know?

869
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,180
So,
yeah.

870
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,610
So to me it's like,
I think these people like Newton,

871
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I think the great people of the world,
they discovered this very specific

872
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,050
pattern that if you apply yourself to
it,

873
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,870
then you will begin to flourish.

874
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,980
And that pattern is written about,
in most scriptures,

875
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:18,340
it's probably somehow hidden in the god
Damn Temple of solid and diagrams.

876
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,070
It's probably in there somehow.
It's,

877
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:26,071
it must be in there because people walk
through the world and the way that fish

878
00:41:27,411 --> 00:41:28,400
swim,
right?

879
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:33,080
And so the smart people must have
figured out the best way to navigate in

880
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,250
this dimension or cardless of your
surroundings or settings or situation

881
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:39,290
that can be handled by adjustment.
So,

882
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:42,320
yeah,
I love to believe that there are hidden,

883
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,310
uh,
methodologies that some of the great

884
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:49,610
people of the world have adopted.
And for whatever reason,

885
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:52,280
keep kind of secret.
They don't talk about it for some

886
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:53,031
reason.
You know,

887
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:55,730
they don't share it with everybody or
they don't say,

888
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:57,380
Oh,
this is why I figured this shit out.

889
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,780
Here's how,
it's not just the discovery I'm

890
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:02,090
interested in with Newton.
It's like,

891
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:03,170
what were you doing?

892
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,410
What were you doing all day long?
What the fuck are you doing?

893
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:08,390
We don't know,
except the fact that when they took his

894
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:10,580
hair,
a sample of his hair,

895
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:16,150
it was filled with fucking mercury man.
So that guy was like in some laboratory

896
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,210
with mercury,
quick,

897
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,380
quick silver,
you know,

898
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,520
with,
I like old scrolls with the temple of

899
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:28,700
Solomon on it,
like staring at it and then dripping

900
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:32,420
mercury through test tubes to try to
transform,

901
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:34,910
lead into gold.
What was he doing?

902
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:37,340
We'll never fucking know.
You'll never know.

903
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:41,380
And how many more people are doing that
now that we don't even know about says

904
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,940
is hidden away.
Like you're doing it electronically now.

905
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,140
Alright.
Yeah,

906
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,240
yeah,
yeah.

907
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,200
They're doing it like,
oh,

908
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:49,430
right.
Because they're trying to bring

909
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:50,400
computers to lie.

910
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,750
That's the real alchemy now,
but when you think about what they knew

911
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:58,780
back then,
when you think about Isaac Newton in

912
00:42:58,781 --> 00:43:02,930
that time period and what he knew as
opposed to what everybody else doing and

913
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,210
like being able to establish something
like a theory about gravity and being

914
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:10,780
able to try to explain this to people
during that time,

915
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:17,080
who knew what was legit and what wasn't.
So like when he was looking at Alchemy,

916
00:43:17,081 --> 00:43:19,600
he might've been thinking,
there's probably something to this.

917
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:21,130
It's just these guys haven't figured it
out.

918
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,200
Right.
What people forgot it or no one knows

919
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:25,060
it,
but it only makes sense if things are

920
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,630
made out of elements that you could
perhaps combine these elements and make

921
00:43:28,631 --> 00:43:30,610
something different.
You could train me.

922
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,740
They didn't know.
They didn't have like a table of

923
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:34,840
elements back then.
They didn't know what all the different

924
00:43:34,841 --> 00:43:35,910
elements were.
That's right.

925
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,010
What year did they develop the table of
elements?

926
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:44,220
That's a really important question
because those elements are essentially

927
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:48,160
what we've been able to measure in the
universe.

928
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,353
Right?
Yeah.

929
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:54,750
And then things like the large Hadron,
which just finally figured out some

930
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:57,430
stuff that we couldn't measure before.

931
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:57,971
Right.
Well,

932
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:01,240
it's launching protons.
You're shooting protons.

933
00:44:01,241 --> 00:44:04,900
Thank God I just listened to this.
It's like you're blasting a proton just

934
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:07,810
under the speed of light.
They collide with each other and they're

935
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,180
trying to make an error.
Leases.

936
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,660
They shit.
Yeah.

937
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:13,630
It's the one missing little piece.
It's like they don't understand

938
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:16,200
something about how things get their
density and,

939
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:19,030
and so if you could figure that out,
I'll make sense down there.

940
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,470
It gets weird down there,
man.

941
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:23,310
It gets very weird down there.
So it's a,

942
00:44:23,311 --> 00:44:24,970
it's,
it's quite confusing.

943
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:25,601
Yeah,
sure.

944
00:44:25,601 --> 00:44:28,750
It does.
Periodic table 1863,

945
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:30,680
is that what it says?
In 1863,

946
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:32,040
there are 50 known elements

947
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,120
with a new element being discovered at a
rate of approximately one a year.

948
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:37,260
Other scientists pump up blah,
blah,

949
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,090
blah.
Um,

950
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:44,150
looks like they did an 1868 to 1870
principles of chemistry.

951
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,170
The definitive textbook of his time to
live men to live.

952
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:54,470
So one mother fucker and 1868 wrote it
all down the periodic table.

953
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,310
Interesting.
And I'm sure it's been adjusted over

954
00:44:59,311 --> 00:44:59,941
time,
right?

955
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:02,160
If they found new elements and new
stuff,

956
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,970
they find new elements all the time,
but they just add them to that.

957
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,090
What do they do?
Well,

958
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,030
they,
when they were first making it,

959
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,740
ah,
there were actually,

960
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,780
they could predict what elements they
would find based on the elements that

961
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:20,220
they had already found because there are
like holes in the periodic table where

962
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,800
there should have been things that they
hadn't found yet.

963
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,190
Did you ever see the girl that graduated
and used as her,

964
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:31,250
her graduation speech?
She use superior odic table that if you,

965
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,970
not from reading how it was written,
but if you just spell it out to what the

966
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:38,760
elements are says fuck bitches get
money.

967
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:40,800
No,
yes.

968
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,300
Yeah.
Wow.

969
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:44,280
She's so gangster.
Check this out.

970
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,060
Look at this.
This is the girl Jessica Lee user

971
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:51,830
periodic table to quote Biggie foot
looks at fluorine,

972
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,900
uranium,
carbon potassium this month.

973
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,300
Technique,
helium,

974
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:00,480
sulfur geraint Germanium low.
Wow.

975
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:04,890
Full throughly only thulium oxygen neon.
And what's this one?

976
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,900
And it says fuck bitches,
get money if you spell it out,

977
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:15,470
dad is hilarious cause fluorine is you.
Uranium is Florian is av uranium as you

978
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:21,090
carbon is.
See that's potassium is k this month is

979
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:26,810
hi technium is TC,
helium is h e Selfer his ass Germania

980
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,160
was,
gee this is amazing.

981
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:35,580
She's so bad ass.
God that girl,

982
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:37,980
she should have the most awesome job
ever.

983
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,390
Someone should hire her and just give
her like the most awesome job available.

984
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:44,910
Colab Commons.
I want to pick what you want.

985
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:48,650
This chick working for you or maybe she
wants to do her own shit.

986
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,770
We'll have you scroll up.
She's very pretty to Duncan the Sunni

987
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,420
wife.
Fuck bitches get money.

988
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,850
Okay Sir.
Is that it's pretty gangster.

989
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:59,400
Pretty gangster.
It's amazing.

990
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,770
I wonder if she got in trouble.
Hop.

991
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,560
What for what?
She likes chemistry.

992
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:08,730
Fuck you as you're about the kid.
I think he's got a felony charge on him

993
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:13,350
cause he posed as a senator and spoke to
a high school and he was like 18 years

994
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:16,220
old and they all believed him.
And I didn't find out until the senator

995
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,510
showed up.
Oh No.

996
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:20,340
So the actual senators showed up and
went,

997
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:21,570
what the fuck?
That's not me.

998
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,200
That is so awesome.
Is there a video of them doing this

999
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,660
powerful Jessica Lee who are wherever
you are,

1000
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:29,250
Jessica Lee,
powerful.

1001
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,713
Oh,
this guy

1002
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:32,970
that,
I'm sorry it's not that story.

1003
00:47:32,971 --> 00:47:34,980
I just saw this.
It just happened yesterday so I think

1004
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:38,010
there's a couple of the kid wouldn't
like Florida who got arrested for being

1005
00:47:38,011 --> 00:47:40,740
a gynecologist.
A is kind of getting confused with it or

1006
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:45,030
like being added to it or are you
talking about Katie was posing as a fake

1007
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:46,500
doctor?
Like same thing.

1008
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:48,360
I,
it was an addendum to that story is how

1009
00:47:48,361 --> 00:47:50,700
I saw it.
A guy like was running a home medical

1010
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,630
clinic.
This kid,

1011
00:47:51,631 --> 00:47:53,340
he's saying he was a doctor but he was

1012
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,260
tear it off on a guy who was doing,
there was a guy in New York that was

1013
00:47:57,261 --> 00:48:02,261
doing a underground but jobs and plastic
surgery shooting caulk like silicone

1014
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:07,610
cock like that you'd buy from a
supermarket or a hardware store.

1015
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,420
And these girls asses 18 year old who
poses a sigh?

1016
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,980
Ohio senator facing charges.
Yeah.

1017
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,980
Yeah.
Well this kid's a fucking psycho.

1018
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,880
The fact that he could pull that off.
Keep an eye on that fucker.

1019
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,710
I want to see that speech.
What did he do it to win a bet?

1020
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,180
It feels like conceptual common.
I'll try to remember some of the story.

1021
00:48:29,181 --> 00:48:32,450
Like he's getting a couple of charges
cause he had had a car rented.

1022
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,100
He had people with them,
like as officials,

1023
00:48:34,101 --> 00:48:37,160
he had fake security.
He went and spoke to a class.

1024
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:42,470
That's hilarious.
So we'll see if he's 18 years old.

1025
00:48:42,471 --> 00:48:44,660
I would like pull him aside,
you know,

1026
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,000
talk to him for a couple days,
get to know them,

1027
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:50,030
find out how crazy you really is.
Sound very smart.

1028
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,360
You might be dealing with some super
genius like sounds hilarious.

1029
00:48:53,361 --> 00:48:56,230
Sounds like.
Like how they would find someone like in

1030
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:59,450
an x men episode,
like one of those x men movies,

1031
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,200
they'd find this guy who was lying to
people and they're like,

1032
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,130
[inaudible] genius.
That level of comedy is,

1033
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,920
that's criminal arrest.

1034
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,670
This guy for wearing sunglasses while
he's doing an interview on TV.

1035
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,350
Take your sunglasses off,
sir.

1036
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,660
America wants to see your fucking
eyeballs.

1037
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,040
Yeah.
Who Do you think you are?

1038
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:21,920
You like busted an 18 year old.
If he's not a senator,

1039
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,640
he's wearing sunglasses like he's Nas
doing an interview on the red carpet

1040
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,950
tech.
Those fucking sunglasses off in doors.

1041
00:49:27,951 --> 00:49:31,880
You son of doing superintendent.
I mean titles are so stupid.

1042
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:34,750
Anyway,
it's like the kid like super intendant.

1043
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:38,930
I'm a super Ken ratcliff superintendent.
Very prestigious position,

1044
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,210
honey.
I've got to do a press conference today

1045
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:45,110
about this dangerous student who
impersonated as senator what our

1046
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:46,820
senators impersonating.
By the way,

1047
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:49,580
it's just a guy.
He calls himself a senator because of a

1048
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:54,590
political system that again and again
gets proven to not be an accurate

1049
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,990
representation of anything.
Relax.

1050
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,430
Well do,
but I can't.

1051
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:13,070
I get so worked up.
I mean it's just this thing where like,

1052
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,900
you know the whole idea of the sacred
senator that was impersonated by this

1053
00:50:17,901 --> 00:50:20,510
terror Rasta kid,
you're going to put handcuffs on a kid

1054
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:24,080
who did one of the funniest things ever.
That's funny.

1055
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,870
It's a very funny thing he did is not
dangerous at all.

1056
00:50:26,871 --> 00:50:27,740
No was hurt.

1057
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,750
Nobody got killed.
No.

1058
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:32,590
None of those kids are going to go home
and do some awful thing.

1059
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,830
If we want order in this country and I
do mean order,

1060
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:41,950
we must stop shenanigans that his
shenanigans manikins must stop.

1061
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,510
Shenanigans must stop or we will not be
unscheduled to construct our robot

1062
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,790
overlords.
Who must push forward,

1063
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,220
push forward,
push forward,

1064
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,650
push forward and innovate.
What is that?

1065
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,800
I was in personnel.
That child have him arrested.

1066
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,000
Throw them in the dodge it.

1067
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,470
What'd you see?
What Isis did?

1068
00:51:01,471 --> 00:51:04,950
They chopped a 15 year old's head off
because he was listening to western

1069
00:51:04,951 --> 00:51:06,290
music.
They are.

1070
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,220
They chopped his head off in the middle
of the street.

1071
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,390
I'm no longer surprised by anything you
hear about isis whenever it comes in.

1072
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,530
It's just a,
it seems like they're running out of

1073
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:19,531
ideas like they're a shock jock keeps
trying new stents to stay.

1074
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:24,400
Stay.
They have pitch meetings.

1075
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,770
It's wacky.
Wednesday,

1076
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,540
we're throwing down today.
Everyone's going to eat garbage.

1077
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,140
Tune in live guys,
we're running out of ways to horrify the

1078
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:37,240
planet.
We've destroyed all the natural

1079
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:41,110
monuments in the area.
I need five great ideas for something

1080
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:43,210
horrible we can do today to shock the
world.

1081
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,171
Someone's like,
well,

1082
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:46,900
I know my neighbors like been playing
country music.

1083
00:51:46,901 --> 00:51:50,500
You can cut his head off.
Who wants to get their mouth shut in for

1084
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:55,070
nickelback tickets?
Come on Steve.

1085
00:51:55,130 --> 00:52:00,070
The caller number 97 widget all
cause.

1086
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:04,180
They're like,
that's what it is.

1087
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,890
Who wants to get their fucking head cut
off?

1088
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,750
It's like,
yet no one shocked anymore.

1089
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:11,140
They overdid babies.
This baby was looking at my deck.

1090
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,270
It's going to grow up gay.
Let's stop the fire.

1091
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:17,800
There's shoving gay people off towers
there.

1092
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,900
Decapitating Christian people.

1093
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:25,160
There was a great piece that someone
wrote about using a gay hookup app in a

1094
00:52:25,161 --> 00:52:29,100
Middle Eastern country and how easy it
was to find guys to fuck.

1095
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,640
Right.
Some guy who put it up there because I

1096
00:52:31,641 --> 00:52:34,370
guess he wouldn't get the death penalty,
but he probably gets thrown into jail.

1097
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:38,120
But a guy who lives in the country,
I forget what country it was,

1098
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,420
was it some Muslim country?
Something with an m I think.

1099
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,570
And anyway,
homeboy got plenty.

1100
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:45,410
Oh,
Dick.

1101
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,480
While he was over there.
Of course.

1102
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,770
Yeah.
Of course.

1103
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,650
Dirty deck.
Dirty with a,

1104
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,600
a lot of sand on it.
Yeah.

1105
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,070
Scamming and scary Dick.
Scary cause you don't know.

1106
00:52:57,071 --> 00:52:58,570
I mean,
that's like a place where there's

1107
00:52:58,571 --> 00:53:01,170
probably undercover cops.
He like,

1108
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,480
like just fuck someone in the ass for a
couple of minutes and then I'm like,

1109
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,970
you're busted.
Or maybe don't even fuck them.

1110
00:53:06,971 --> 00:53:09,570
Just try to find them and kill them
because they're gay.

1111
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,600
Fuck them.
Whoa.

1112
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:11,291
You think so?
Yeah.

1113
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:13,150
It's like you gotta smoke weed if you're
a,

1114
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:18,151
if you're an undercover cop,
it's the same thing.

1115
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:20,770
You got to suck some cocks out there,
man.

1116
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:23,810
You gotta like Suck Cox.
Play it cool for awhile.

1117
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,170
He paid
go into deep cover.

1118
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:29,431
Deep cover,
bro.

1119
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:32,670
You got to take in the ass for five
grain proven porn.

1120
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,100
It's a great porn movie.
It's been proven bro.

1121
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:40,590
They do not trust you for the first few
months.

1122
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,340
Too many guys had just been fucking
stolen,

1123
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:43,680
man.

1124
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,840
They've been stolen.
You're going to have to do it.

1125
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,420
You gotta and you gotta be convincing.
You gotta be a lover.

1126
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,410
Look,
let me show you.

1127
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:52,230
I'm going to shock a lot of caulk.
We're going to send you to our training

1128
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:53,580
camp.
It's in my apartment.

1129
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,560
You won't suck cock for you country.
Is that what you're telling me you're

1130
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:58,470
doing?
You're happy if the japs come over here

1131
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,650
and just eat all our babies cause that
what the fuck is going on here?

1132
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,470
Are you a coward?
You won't suck a Dick for for America.

1133
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,190
For Uncle Sam sex laws.
Yeah man.

1134
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:11,280
You got to have sex laws like the moment
you have sex laws,

1135
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:15,390
the moment that you have decreed a sex
law in your country,

1136
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,720
then you are going to create a nation of
perverts because you have supercharged

1137
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:24,360
whatever.
The thing is that you're trying to keep

1138
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:28,680
illegal by adding to it that it's like
now you're breaking the fucking law.

1139
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:33,840
That's the best that's now you have a
way to express your Abelian and calm at

1140
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:35,840
the same time.
Just make it,

1141
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:38,440
you can't make sodomy illegal.
Well,

1142
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:39,090
it's,
we,

1143
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,420
we talked about this when I was
explaining how I dated girls when I was

1144
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:46,290
in high school that went to Catholic
school and that every kid in Catholic

1145
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:47,150
school,
the,

1146
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,190
that we all knew,
the girls who went to Catholic school

1147
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:53,970
where the biggest hose,
they could all do respect to hose.

1148
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,630
It's not a bad thing,
but they were so sexually charged.

1149
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,840
They were so completely wired that sex
was this forbidden thing that is burning

1150
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:07,260
up inside of them and they would feel so
bad about it when it was over,

1151
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:09,180
but they would do it again over and over
again.

1152
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,060
It was so common.
Whereas girls who went to public school,

1153
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,860
they were fucking normal for the most
part,

1154
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:16,710
unless something bad happened in their
life.

1155
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,890
Yeah.
And and to think that there are actual

1156
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:24,950
ordinances all over the world where some
guy's written down in,

1157
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:31,041
in legal code that you will not place
your penis and an asshole or a mouth or

1158
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:36,840
I'm out of mouth is sodomy getting your
Dick sucked as sodomy and is still

1159
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:39,270
illegal in certain states.
Right?

1160
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,260
Yeah.
Pull,

1161
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:45,260
pull up sodomy laws in 2016 because as
far as I know in Georgia,

1162
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,970
I was researching this because I am a
researcher.

1163
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,180
I don't know if you realize I was
reading some shit.

1164
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:59,181
Smart people wrote down about this like
seven or eight years ago and there was

1165
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:03,270
some dispute about it that it was like
there was some places in the country

1166
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:08,010
where we're still illegal to have anal
or oral sex because it falls under a

1167
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:10,560
sodomy law.
Go down on your wife,

1168
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,753
you can go to jail.

1169
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,760
Cops come in and they catch you going
down your wife.

1170
00:56:14,761 --> 00:56:16,770
You're committing a fucking cry.
Yeah.

1171
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,100
He loves that.
That's real and someplace.

1172
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,460
Yes,
that's true.

1173
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,020
That's the state,
right?

1174
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,780
Fuck t that ever get written down in the
first place.

1175
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:28,810
Like who's trying to stop pussy eating,
who's just stepping in and saying,

1176
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,750
this is just way too much pussy eating
going on.

1177
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,280
We've got to lock these fucking people
up.

1178
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,800
Like who,
who,

1179
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,730
who did that?
Well,

1180
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:41,820
I probably a hardcore Christian.
I would imagine.

1181
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:46,150
I mean when you were a lot of the people
living in this country,

1182
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:48,880
not that very long ago,
or you know,

1183
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:53,881
burning witches.
So probably like sucking on a pussy is

1184
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:58,981
considered to be some form of witchcraft
because the body was evil.

1185
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:00,870
The ideas,
the bodies,

1186
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:03,940
the bodies corrupt,
the body is correct as to the body's

1187
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:05,050
corrupt,
special yours.

1188
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,870
It's corrupt.
I stink.

1189
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,210
Corrupt.
But the body is foul.

1190
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:11,500
The body is,
yeah.

1191
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:14,920
So you have to deal file your foul.
You have original sin,

1192
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,080
you have original sin.
Why do,

1193
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,570
well you've got to,
uh,

1194
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,120
I don't want to die.
You know that if you let it go,

1195
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,740
that's right.
How do I not go to hell?

1196
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:28,590
Please tell we've got a payment plan,
but they make you,

1197
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,290
you don't have to suck a few decks,
but they make you,

1198
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:36,490
you can whip your back.
That's what people would gorge herself.

1199
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:38,980
People still do that.
They do it with knives,

1200
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,880
swapped themselves with knives and touch
the strings and they just tear their

1201
00:57:42,881 --> 00:57:45,550
back apart.
And as suicide bomb just went off at one

1202
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:47,980
of those things.
So there's video of people whipping

1203
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:50,170
their backs and then a suicide bomb
goes,

1204
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:55,290
that's how weird shit is.
Pull up the suicide bomb back whipping

1205
00:57:55,361 --> 00:57:56,194
festival.

1206
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,700
The festival.
Yeah.

1207
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,170
No,
I thought the fucking dog eating

1208
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:06,940
festival was fake.
That dog.

1209
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,410
Any festival in China.
I was like,

1210
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:10,330
there's not really a dog eating festival
is there?

1211
00:58:10,331 --> 00:58:12,850
I thought that was just a joke as it
sounds so funny.

1212
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,510
Yulin dog meat festival.
Um,

1213
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,630
and then I made the mistake of looking
up do that.

1214
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,720
Don't look at that.
Whoa.

1215
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:27,750
That's the worst thing of all time is so
weird.

1216
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:31,300
The,
the hierarchy of animal life that we

1217
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:33,100
have in this world.
Right.

1218
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:37,780
Do you think that's coming more into
focus now that you're hunting animals

1219
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:41,730
now that you've actually killed animals,
do you think like your views on it are

1220
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:46,000
shifting at all because you're
slaughtering your own meat sometimes now

1221
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,680
I think I,
I have more experiences with some,

1222
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:54,100
some wild animals than some people do.
That's about it.

1223
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,700
Um,
but what do I know in terms of me,

1224
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,580
the whole experience,
the wild animal experience.

1225
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:03,580
All right.
This is just the experience of getting

1226
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:08,581
out of the city and going into the wild
itself is very psychedelic and some very

1227
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:12,610
strange way and I didn't feel that way
until I started hunting

1228
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,130
sounds.
Babel.

1229
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,270
Let me explain.
When I,

1230
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,330
before when I would go to the wilderness
before I'd be like,

1231
00:59:19,331 --> 00:59:21,560
what a cool place.
So beautiful.

1232
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:22,550
It's so peaceful.

1233
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,230
I love,
I love the clean air.

1234
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,570
I love looking at the green trees.
Look how pretty that river is.

1235
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:33,190
When I started hunting I became somehow
or another like connected to all these

1236
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:38,891
living things that are there and you're
in their world and you exist on their

1237
00:59:39,081 --> 00:59:40,310
vibration.
It's very,

1238
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,600
when you're hunting like an elk or
something like that and you're slowly

1239
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:49,601
creeping up on it in the woods with real
consequences involved for both of you.

1240
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,040
Right?
Like a real moment,

1241
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:55,610
a real end to,
and then when you do take that animal

1242
00:59:55,611 --> 01:00:00,140
and kill it and wind up eating it,
you've got some in credibly weird

1243
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,770
psychic connection to that place in the
world,

1244
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,480
that place on our planet.
It's not just as simple as like,

1245
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:11,240
I know where my food comes from.
Yeah,

1246
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,860
but that's,
that's,

1247
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:17,780
that's definitely good.
But killing it yourself and then eating

1248
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,420
it,
there's a totally different thing going

1249
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:24,800
on there and killing it with a bow and
Arrow hunting this thing down,

1250
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,530
finding it,
putting a perfect shot on it,

1251
01:00:27,531 --> 01:00:29,000
killing it,
watching it die,

1252
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:31,220
then eating it and then knowing when you
eat it,

1253
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:36,170
they just experiences insane primal
experiences connected to this food.

1254
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,810
Right?
There's so much going on there.

1255
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:39,920
It's so,
there's so much,

1256
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:44,210
so much weird calming things happen.
Like it puts you in like this,

1257
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,800
you know,
we were talking about like there's

1258
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:48,710
certain primal reward systems that we
all have.

1259
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:51,410
Like we were talking about like making a
fire.

1260
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,710
Like there's something about standing
over a fire that's like a primal reward

1261
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:55,544
system.
Yeah,

1262
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,860
there's a little bit of that and bows
and arrows to,

1263
01:00:57,861 --> 01:00:58,730
right.
Sure.

1264
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,240
It's almost like these things are
established in our,

1265
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:07,400
in our our mind because they're what
made people become successful and

1266
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:12,290
survive thousands of years ago and those
rewards are ingrained in our patterns

1267
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,950
and it's like almost like ignoring them
by not going outside,

1268
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,190
by not starting fire,
by not doing things like archery or

1269
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:23,300
physical exercise.
Will you reward your body with these

1270
01:01:23,301 --> 01:01:27,020
experiences that it's,
it's just craving on a genetic level.

1271
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,680
It's right.
It's not making you a dummy to exercise

1272
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:33,050
your body.
It's not making you a fool to care about

1273
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:38,051
camp fires it you're taking in something
in this world that you might need.

1274
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,950
That's right.
The same thing.

1275
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,980
I've been thinking a lot about this.
I've been thinking about a lot of this

1276
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:46,490
in,
in applying to why things are attractive

1277
01:01:46,491 --> 01:01:51,140
and beautiful because I've been freaking
out about views lately because I have

1278
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:55,700
this friend and uh,
he doesn't give a fuck about views,

1279
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:58,340
could not care less,
doesn't go anywhere,

1280
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,250
just works and you know,
and his house like that was,

1281
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:03,320
it was like,
that was our last concern was the view

1282
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:06,740
we're into our people and this guy's
just constantly do or watching Netflix,

1283
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,240
working,
watching Netflix.

1284
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,760
And I was thinking like w w what,
what is it that I like about a view?

1285
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:15,470
Like what the fuck is it?
Like why,

1286
01:02:15,471 --> 01:02:19,040
why is it important to me to stare like
a moron out into psych?

1287
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,070
What is beauty?

1288
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:24,180
Like what is this thing that I'm seeing
what I see snow capped mountains and

1289
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:25,960
clouds rolling the cross,
uh,

1290
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:30,030
mostly blue sky and the sun rays hitting
the green leaves.

1291
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:33,960
To me it's like,
like some sort of a common drug.

1292
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:39,110
Like my body is being given some stuff
that it needed and I wasn't getting it

1293
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:41,730
when I was inside the house.
I wasn't getting it when it was in my

1294
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:42,361
car.
Right?

1295
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:46,410
I needed to be there and it was giving
me this thing that I can't put on a

1296
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:48,450
scale.
I can't measure it with a ruler,

1297
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:50,610
but it's a thing.
It's a real thing that you're

1298
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:53,730
experiencing.
I think all those things that made us

1299
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:58,740
alive in 2016 all those things are
those,

1300
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:03,690
they're a part of like our requirements
and because so few people fill out those

1301
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:06,180
requirements.
I think that's one of the reasons why so

1302
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:07,350
many people are depressed.

1303
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,670
And I think the beauty is because those
beautiful things that we look at almost

1304
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:15,060
always they represent places where life
flourishes,

1305
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,910
right?
So it's almost like as people wandering

1306
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:22,911
across the world looking for food,
if you saw all the sudden green grass

1307
01:03:24,181 --> 01:03:28,560
and fruit hanging from trees and animals
and there's snow.

1308
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:30,690
So the snow cap mountains,
which means is a river,

1309
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:32,460
there's water,
we can drink the water,

1310
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,500
we got food,
we're going to live,

1311
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:35,880
we're going to live,
try it.

1312
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:40,881
And so you would see that beautiful
bountiful forest in front of you and Ah,

1313
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,530
it would feed your requirement.

1314
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:44,311
And,
and,

1315
01:03:44,311 --> 01:03:44,820
and it,
it,

1316
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:45,740
it,
these are,

1317
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,050
it tells you something cause it,
you,

1318
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,240
it tells you this huge secret.
Yeah.

1319
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,000
And I'm not saying there's a conspiracy
where people don't want you to know this

1320
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,710
because it's obviously something you
know,

1321
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:59,711
but the earth supports you and the earth
will take care of you.

1322
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:02,930
If you work hard,
the earth will take care of you,

1323
01:04:02,931 --> 01:04:07,931
not work hard as in like work hard in
your factory or your company,

1324
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:13,420
but suddenly when you realize there's a
force that transcends the law of

1325
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:18,500
humanity and that is nature.
And then you realize that if you know

1326
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:20,510
how to like,
like I was telling you,

1327
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:22,490
I'm trying to learn how to start a bow
fire right now.

1328
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,750
Right.
And uh,

1329
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,580
I'm just to get a bit like that,
dude,

1330
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,450
there's different ways of doing it.
I mean,

1331
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:31,160
I just want to start a friction base
fire that guy was doing,

1332
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,020
like that guy was doing,
I was going to fuck your hands up.

1333
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:35,360
I don't care.
I want to do what I want to experience

1334
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:38,270
it and I want to know that I can do it.
And uh,

1335
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:40,310
but,
but what starts happening when you,

1336
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:43,340
when you're doing shit like shooting a
bow and you realize like,

1337
01:04:43,341 --> 01:04:44,450
Whoa,
I could do this.

1338
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:48,080
I can like hit a target.
And then the implication is if you

1339
01:04:48,081 --> 01:04:50,810
needed to,
you could hunt your own food.

1340
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:54,260
You wouldn't have to go to a job,
you wouldn't have to get enough money to

1341
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:56,840
buy the food.
If you get good enough at this,

1342
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:01,460
you can hunt your own food and it
doesn't matter who's paying you.

1343
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,420
And if you can start your own fire,
you can have heat no matter what.

1344
01:05:05,421 --> 01:05:07,040
And then if you can build your own
shelter,

1345
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:11,460
you can have a shelter somewhere and all
these things when you see they come for

1346
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:14,990
you in a way,
because it seems like so much of our

1347
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:19,991
society is based on this incredible
insecurity that if you don't keep

1348
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:25,390
marching in place,
your life is going to fall apart because

1349
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:29,920
you have become a slacker and yeah,
and you've gone against the,

1350
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:30,783
the,
the,

1351
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:35,120
the,
the pulsation of modern society and,

1352
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,430
and my improvement.

1353
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,900
Yeah,
exactly.

1354
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:41,710
And that's what we're,
that's an incorrect anxiety inducing

1355
01:05:41,711 --> 01:05:42,544
place.
Yes.

1356
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,160
So it's a scary place to be.
It's like fuck.

1357
01:05:45,161 --> 01:05:46,360
So like,
shit man,

1358
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:50,230
I got to pay this much for taxes and I
got to go to work this many hours a week

1359
01:05:50,231 --> 01:05:52,840
and I've got to like all of these things
that I have to do.

1360
01:05:52,841 --> 01:05:56,060
I've got my fucking credit card payments
that I have to make.

1361
01:05:56,061 --> 01:05:57,310
And if I don't do that,
I'm in trouble.

1362
01:05:57,311 --> 01:06:01,600
You're like abiding by a false system.
It's a real system,

1363
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:04,840
but it's not.
The real is like the earth where if

1364
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:07,480
you're on the earth and you're walking,
you're not thinking shit,

1365
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:10,990
man,
rent's due next month.

1366
01:06:10,991 --> 01:06:15,190
You're thinking,
I've got to find food to eat.

1367
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:18,820
I've got to find a place to take
shelter.

1368
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,220
I've got there.
All these things are very simple and

1369
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:23,230
there's no human in charge of it.

1370
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:26,320
You don't.
You're not making a call to the woman at

1371
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:31,321
Bank of America asking her why she froze
your card up because he used to parking

1372
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:35,620
meters on the same day that were close
to each other in a weird place and now

1373
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,660
you're not able to buy dinner.
There's no,

1374
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:41,890
when you're in the nature hunting,
there's no operator that you call to

1375
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:45,790
complain about the lack of food or to
complain about the weather.

1376
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,980
It's just truth,
pure,

1377
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:51,760
unadulterated,
100% truth,

1378
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:55,000
and when you're in contact with truth,
it feels fucking crate.

1379
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,810
It's relaxing.
If you've constantly been basing your

1380
01:06:58,811 --> 01:07:02,170
perception of truth on what other people
are telling you it is.

1381
01:07:02,171 --> 01:07:03,880
I think that's part of the comfort of
it.

1382
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,660
Well,
there's a pole without a doubt that

1383
01:07:06,661 --> 01:07:11,070
humanity is experiencing and that poll
has been going on since people figured

1384
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:14,430
out how to make the first bow fire.
It's when they figured out how to

1385
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,500
control fire.
Then they figured out how to make

1386
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:20,340
shelter and then they figured out how to
stockpile shit and they figured out how

1387
01:07:20,341 --> 01:07:24,030
to group together in small villages and
then they figured out how to make walls

1388
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,570
and they figured out how to make cities
and they figured out how to cool shit

1389
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:30,090
off and that's worth stuff.
Got Freaky,

1390
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,490
right?
They figured out factory farming and

1391
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:35,640
they figured out fast food and they
figured out supermarkets and then they

1392
01:07:35,641 --> 01:07:39,930
figured out the electrical maze that
goes through this entire country that

1393
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,050
keeps everything cold.
All your food stays cold.

1394
01:07:43,051 --> 01:07:45,570
You always have food.
You can heat things up,

1395
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,000
you can cool things off.
We got that shit on lock.

1396
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:48,600
Yeah,
it's,

1397
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,360
and then from then it's like what we're
doing is,

1398
01:07:51,361 --> 01:07:56,361
this is like the final stages of a
caterpillar covering itself with a

1399
01:07:56,491 --> 01:07:59,640
cocoon.
This is the last final frenzy.

1400
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,520
So there's an innovation that's been
going on for thousands of years,

1401
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:06,240
but then it hits this point about a
hundred years ago or so where they

1402
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:10,110
figured out how to cool things down.
They figured out ice boxes and then

1403
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,910
refrigerators,
and then it got to the point where

1404
01:08:11,911 --> 01:08:15,170
everybody had a refrigerator and then it
got to the point where supermarkets were

1405
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:16,130
everywhere.
Like

1406
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,130
all the cities have supermarkets and
then everybody lost their connection to

1407
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:20,150
nature.
Everybody,

1408
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,560
right?
You had to go out and get it.

1409
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:24,860
You had to go find your connection,
but even then you can action was all we

1410
01:08:24,861 --> 01:08:27,110
like to be out in nature.
How many days a week,

1411
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,150
right?
It was it even one,

1412
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:30,043
right?
No,

1413
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,780
it's usually once every two weeks.
You go on a hike and you claim your

1414
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:33,500
nature,
boy,

1415
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,850
shut the fuck up.
Okay,

1416
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:35,480
we're,
we're,

1417
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,750
we're in the hive right now or
constructing this crazy thing.

1418
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,840
Sure.
And if you really are like a real solid

1419
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:43,700
ass nature person that's out there in
the woods,

1420
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,600
you gotta be freaked out watching this
go on outside your front door because

1421
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:51,920
even the world that you live is going to
be affected by this craziness of these

1422
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:56,750
fucking frenzied cocoon making monkeys
that are scrambling to cover everything

1423
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:59,000
with wires.
They're covering everything with

1424
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:04,001
electrical wires and internet wires and
wireless wires is everywhere.

1425
01:09:04,071 --> 01:09:07,480
I'm matrix of information and data
swarming around.

1426
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:12,310
My brother has a place off the coast of
Georgia,

1427
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,180
uh,
this place called little cumberland.

1428
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,120
It's beautiful.
They can't,

1429
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:16,741
you can't,
I mean,

1430
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:19,030
you could try and get there.
It's a beautiful place.

1431
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:21,640
But uh,
man,

1432
01:09:21,641 --> 01:09:23,200
and,
and it's a place where like,

1433
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,470
it's like a nature conservancy.
So the people who live there

1434
01:09:26,471 --> 01:09:28,630
grandfathered in,
it's a very intense,

1435
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,330
beautiful place.
But the point is now they're having

1436
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:32,740
these fucking problems,
right?

1437
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,800
Because guess what?
Someone wants to build right next to

1438
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:39,280
this beautiful chain of islands off the
coast of Georgia oil refinery,

1439
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:42,460
a space center.
What do they want to build?

1440
01:09:42,461 --> 01:09:45,400
A place to launch fucking rockets into
space.

1441
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,580
Yes.
And it's what you know and right outside

1442
01:09:48,581 --> 01:09:49,570
of this thing,
yes.

1443
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,550
And,
and it's a fucking problem and hopefully

1444
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:52,440
they'll,
they'll did,

1445
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,380
this is where my mind,
this is right now is like where my mind

1446
01:09:56,381 --> 01:10:01,381
is really in a boxing match with itself
because I Yap so much about virtual

1447
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:03,370
reality technology.

1448
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:04,780
I love it.
It's incredible.

1449
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,350
But lately after I've been doing this,
like just,

1450
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:11,020
I mean it sounds so guys,
I've been inside so much,

1451
01:10:11,021 --> 01:10:14,770
this seems spectacular to me,
but now that I've been going outside and

1452
01:10:14,771 --> 01:10:18,940
just shooting a bow and arrow or just
going outside and like hanging out with

1453
01:10:18,941 --> 01:10:23,260
my dogs or just being outside and like,
you know,

1454
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,680
uh,
one interesting byproduct that I've

1455
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:31,420
noticed from microdosing lsd and also
are from not just micro dosing,

1456
01:10:31,421 --> 01:10:34,780
but from taking mushrooms is the next
day you feel more connected to nature.

1457
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:38,620
You notice plants again,
you see how beautiful flowers are again.

1458
01:10:38,621 --> 01:10:40,210
Well,
you don't need the psychedelic to do

1459
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:45,070
that.
You can just spend one minute stopping

1460
01:10:45,071 --> 01:10:50,071
next to a flower and staring at it up
close and you'll realize this is w this

1461
01:10:51,821 --> 01:10:53,710
is an alien.
This is some beautiful,

1462
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:58,630
insane alien habitat for all these other
creatures that are living inside of it.

1463
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:02,440
And it's just fucking amazing.
And so I don't know,

1464
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:04,000
I mean I'm,
listen,

1465
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:07,420
I'm not about to turn into a nudist and
go running off into the woods or

1466
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:10,150
anything like that,
but what about the show today?

1467
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:13,620
The way I'm going to become a nudist and
run the woods?

1468
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,930
I would,
you know what,

1469
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:18,390
I,
I kind of get the whole that the whole

1470
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:19,800
next day,
but the,

1471
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:20,371
the,
the,

1472
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:21,460
uh,
the,

1473
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:27,060
the problem in my mind is like
simultaneous to this incredible feeling

1474
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:31,710
you get from nature.
There is this other thing that's

1475
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:33,060
emerging and,
and,

1476
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:36,510
and where did the,
there's gotta be a way to balance the

1477
01:11:36,511 --> 01:11:41,511
two out,
but the feeling I get from playing six

1478
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:46,791
hours of fallout four versus the feeling
I get from doing yard work for five

1479
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:51,810
hours or four hours,
and then shooting arrows after that,

1480
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:56,880
or two very different feelings.
And one is an incredible feeling.

1481
01:11:56,881 --> 01:11:59,220
Like you just got a massage for six
hours,

1482
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:01,770
you feel rejuvenated,
happy,

1483
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:04,350
this kind of clean.
You're not clean at all,

1484
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,540
but you feel like you've just taken a
shower,

1485
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:08,700
like your energy's been cleansed or
something.

1486
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,450
And then the other feeling is like the
filthy,

1487
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:14,700
nasty,
disgusting feeling you get from being

1488
01:12:14,701 --> 01:12:15,534
outside.

1489
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,970
Aye.

1490
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:24,960
Well,
Dunkin,

1491
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:29,220
I feel the exact opposite.
Why when I used to play quake for eight

1492
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:33,240
hours a night,
I would feel like the biggest loser in

1493
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:34,830
the world when it was done,
I would be like,

1494
01:12:34,831 --> 01:12:38,160
what am I doing with my life?
You're so you're fucked up.

1495
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:40,770
Sweaty,
wait way over caffeinated by the way.

1496
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,740
I would drink wage was drinking these
sodas that I found.

1497
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:46,020
There's this place in north Hollywood,
um,

1498
01:12:46,021 --> 01:12:48,180
near where I lived that had these,
um,

1499
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:53,270
there were like,
brainwash was one of them and uh,

1500
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:55,680
they had like a skull on the cover.
It had blue dye,

1501
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:57,740
like a turn your lips blue and your
toddler.

1502
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,090
Jesus.
Carly's terrible for you.

1503
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,440
But it was so fucking loaded with
caffeine and sugar.

1504
01:13:04,441 --> 01:13:07,860
I would down like five of those while I
was playing video games.

1505
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:08,570
Yeah,
man.

1506
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:11,680
I mean it's got,
it's like I've been a video game addict

1507
01:13:11,681 --> 01:13:14,090
for most of my life and to good there
too.

1508
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,070
Good.
But it,

1509
01:13:15,071 --> 01:13:18,280
the feet.
I've also been someone who loves

1510
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,230
psychedelics and uh,
the,

1511
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:22,380
the different,
it's,

1512
01:13:22,381 --> 01:13:27,381
it's just very important to,
to be honest about where your fucking

1513
01:13:28,121 --> 01:13:31,270
arrows are landing.
And like if you're playing video games

1514
01:13:31,271 --> 01:13:34,210
all the time and you're getting fat and
feeling sick,

1515
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,360
that's real.
Like you're getting fat and feeling

1516
01:13:37,361 --> 01:13:39,400
sick.
Like don't trick yourself into thinking

1517
01:13:39,401 --> 01:13:41,980
that you're not like,
you feel like shit for a reason because

1518
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:47,010
something about being inside the cave,
the artificial cave staring into an

1519
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:49,150
artificial environment.
God,

1520
01:13:49,151 --> 01:13:49,984
I'm sorry you guys,

1521
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,550
I do love it.
But here's the thing about what you're

1522
01:13:52,551 --> 01:13:55,220
saying.
Is it indoor archery has a very similar

1523
01:13:55,221 --> 01:13:57,950
feeling is outdoor archery.
They do indoor archery.

1524
01:13:57,951 --> 01:14:01,340
Tournament's alright.
It's archery is a different thing man.

1525
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,730
It's um,
it's not just the outside part of it,

1526
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,050
the outside of the part of it today,
like when you and I were doing it,

1527
01:14:06,051 --> 01:14:07,610
it was definitely fun.
It's cool.

1528
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:10,070
It's cool to be outside.
And we had a lot of laughs.

1529
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,410
Shot Arrows for a few.
Yeah.

1530
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,010
But

1531
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,660
the indoor thing is really fun too,
man.

1532
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:17,080
There's something really zen about the
concentration,

1533
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:20,980
the concentrating on your form,
and that when you're holding that shot,

1534
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:23,980
you really can't think of anything other
than executing correctly,

1535
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,840
right.
Everything has to be in line and then

1536
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:30,550
release the Arrow and then you have to
judge by where that landed,

1537
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,920
what you could done differently.
If it's perfect,

1538
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:33,401
you're like,
okay,

1539
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:34,900
we recreate that.
Right.

1540
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:37,660
Try to recreate that.
And there's some sort of a weird

1541
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:40,510
meditation effect in doing that because
it's just,

1542
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:43,360
there's no interference.
It's just you and that target.

1543
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,280
There's no one trying to block your
arrows.

1544
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:49,150
There's no one screaming in your ear.
And it's difficult enough.

1545
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:54,540
That's why like there's something about
it that it's like when it all comes

1546
01:14:54,641 --> 01:14:56,170
together,
it's like a reward,

1547
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:57,940
like a beautiful musical note or
something.

1548
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:58,930
That's it.
Yeah.

1549
01:14:58,970 --> 01:14:59,150
You're

1550
01:14:59,150 --> 01:14:59,920
getting,
it's,

1551
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,100
it's just there is,
the world is alive,

1552
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:06,110
right?
You don't have to take acid to realize

1553
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,944
that,
but the war.

1554
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:10,940
But it helps the world is alive and,
and,

1555
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:12,200
and when you're,
when you,

1556
01:15:12,201 --> 01:15:15,740
when you're in this living being,
whatever it may,

1557
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:18,770
whatever it is composed of all these
other living beings,

1558
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,290
a tea,
it has as one of its qualities.

1559
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,410
It teaches you,
cause like one thing I love to think

1560
01:15:24,411 --> 01:15:26,510
about is who's the smartest person on
earth,

1561
01:15:26,511 --> 01:15:28,520
right?
And what would the smartest person be

1562
01:15:28,521 --> 01:15:31,340
like?
And I then I think,

1563
01:15:31,341 --> 01:15:33,170
well,
who's the smartest person I know and

1564
01:15:33,171 --> 01:15:35,930
what are they like?
And then I try to from that,

1565
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:40,100
imagine what if that pattern keeps
getting more intense,

1566
01:15:40,101 --> 01:15:41,570
more and more intense,
more and more intense,

1567
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:43,870
more more intense?
Who would that person be like?

1568
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:46,040
Like what does perfection look like?
Right?

1569
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:51,400
So you go into nature and you
instantaneously get a glimpse at

1570
01:15:51,591 --> 01:15:52,730
perfection,
right?

1571
01:15:52,731 --> 01:15:56,060
You look at a flower,
you look at any plant.

1572
01:15:56,061 --> 01:16:00,110
Why?
If you look at most animals and what you

1573
01:16:00,111 --> 01:16:02,990
are taught is these things,
they don't care about themselves.

1574
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,610
They don't seem to care about
themselves,

1575
01:16:04,611 --> 01:16:06,980
the personality,
the ego,

1576
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:10,700
the identity.
Obviously flowers are not getting their

1577
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:14,900
hair blown out in the morning and
they're not concerned about anything at

1578
01:16:14,901 --> 01:16:18,110
all.
They just seem to be an expression of

1579
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,270
life into the universe.
No Ego,

1580
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:21,530
no personality,
no identity.

1581
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:25,880
They're invisible.
How there's a whole goddamn beautiful

1582
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:27,330
Bush of these,
uh,

1583
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:29,120
someone,
I posted a picture of it,

1584
01:16:29,121 --> 01:16:30,710
but someone told me I can't run the name
of them.

1585
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:35,240
Beautiful purple flowers and like I
walked by him every day when I'm walking

1586
01:16:35,241 --> 01:16:37,100
the dogs and,
and I've never noticed them.

1587
01:16:37,101 --> 01:16:38,030
I've never noticed them.

1588
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,990
And then I looked over at then the other
day and the wind's blowing in there.

1589
01:16:41,991 --> 01:16:44,870
It looks like they're like dancing or
bowing or bending.

1590
01:16:44,871 --> 01:16:46,040
And then I got closer.
I'm like,

1591
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,200
my God,
this is a life form.

1592
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:52,670
This is like a living thing that I've
been walking by every single day and it

1593
01:16:52,671 --> 01:16:54,290
doesn't give a shit.
If I look at it,

1594
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:57,080
it doesn't care if I look at it,
we don't know what it cares about.

1595
01:16:57,081 --> 01:16:59,450
It probably cares about nothing,
no central nervous system,

1596
01:16:59,451 --> 01:17:03,410
but it's alive and it's there.
So if you take that as perfection,

1597
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:07,370
which I think it is,
and then from that try to establish what

1598
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:09,980
a perfect super intelligent would be
like.

1599
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,520
Then from that you get this idea of what
enlightenment might look like.

1600
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:18,550
A pure reflection of nature unimpeded by
the awful anchor of the EGOIC mind.

1601
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,910
But it would also be forced to try to
understand what it's doing as a

1602
01:17:25,911 --> 01:17:28,790
collective species.
What does it doing with this massive

1603
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,920
thirst for innovation?
You right,

1604
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,490
what does it doing?
Constantly trying to make more money and

1605
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,450
get a bigger house,
get a fatter boat.

1606
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,610
What does it doing?
Like what's it doing?

1607
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,160
Why is it continuing to want the latest
and greatest?

1608
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:43,040
Why does it continue to ask for new
innovation session with the self?

1609
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:45,950
It's all obsession with itself.
Its obsession with technology too.

1610
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:50,180
And but it's technology.
I mean tech is so much of technology

1611
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:52,040
now.
Like imagine if they weren't to know

1612
01:17:52,041 --> 01:17:53,170
social network,
right?

1613
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:55,100
You,
I'm not going to say the joke but you

1614
01:17:55,101 --> 01:17:57,950
have a very,
very funny joke about likes.

1615
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:59,830
I'm not going to give it away.
It's a very funny,

1616
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:01,063
but,
uh,

1617
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:02,260
so like so much of,
of,

1618
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,950
of uh,
technology is based on getting this

1619
01:18:06,951 --> 01:18:08,490
instant feedback.
Right.

1620
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:09,290
Okay.
Okay.

1621
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:13,160
So it's so much about the self.
If you remove that component where

1622
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:15,650
you're not connecting with people,
you're not getting this weird like,

1623
01:18:15,651 --> 01:18:16,760
okay,
you're in the group.

1624
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:17,581
Okay,
we like you.

1625
01:18:17,581 --> 01:18:20,270
Okay then,
then now we've just got these kind of

1626
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:22,670
like calculator books or something.
Right.

1627
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:26,510
But so much of people are really using
technology,

1628
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,300
uh,
because they want to feel like they're

1629
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:32,360
using it as a way to identify themselves
as a thing.

1630
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:35,120
You know,
it's an expression of themselves.

1631
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:35,954
But,
uh,

1632
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:41,120
I think that the more you free yourself
from this from an identity,

1633
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,930
and that's something that does happen
when you're out in nature and especially

1634
01:18:44,931 --> 01:18:47,180
when you're doing the kind of shit
you're doing where you're out there for

1635
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,014
a few days.

1636
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,890
I'm no fucking Goddamn grizzly Adams.
This might come as a big surprise,

1637
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:55,010
but I've been in nature.
When I used to work at a summer camp,

1638
01:18:55,011 --> 01:19:00,011
we went out for this like week long hike
and like three days in I realized I

1639
01:19:00,021 --> 01:19:03,830
hadn't looked at myself for three days,
like three days of not seeing myself.

1640
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:08,831
Three days of no self to observe and man
I was getting so happy and like you know

1641
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:14,570
like the weightiness of the self and
then when you're with a group of people

1642
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:19,040
who are all working together,
then you're self gets transposed into

1643
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:21,500
the group.
So now there's a group self where

1644
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:25,100
everyone's kind of working together.
The point is we're all,

1645
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:29,060
we've got our noses shoved like fucking
dogs,

1646
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:32,330
right in our own assholes,
right into the asshole of ourselves

1647
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:36,620
constantly thinking about ourselves,
concerned about this.

1648
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:37,490
Me Does.
He liked me.

1649
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:38,360
He doesn't like me.
God,

1650
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:41,360
that guy is doing so good.
Why am I not doing as good as that guy?

1651
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,920
Holy Shit.
I'm getting fat.

1652
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:44,270
Look at your body.
My God.

1653
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,470
God,
you're getting old.

1654
01:19:45,471 --> 01:19:46,610
Oh God.
Yourself,

1655
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:47,600
yourself,
yourself.

1656
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:52,870
Everyone's fixated on it.
But if you imagine that being like a

1657
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:55,970
kind of gravity and that somehow
vanishing,

1658
01:19:55,971 --> 01:20:00,110
so you just like a plant blowing in the
wind and tree,

1659
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:04,610
you become invisible,
you become invisible and you become

1660
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:08,130
perfect instantaneously.
It's this obsession

1661
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:13,080
with this ridiculous contrivance that we
call the self that is making so many

1662
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:17,790
people fucking hurt and so and all and
like talk about this new modern life.

1663
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:22,560
Well it's all built on teaching people
to be fixated on that fucking self.

1664
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,200
You know,
all of the great stars,

1665
01:20:25,201 --> 01:20:26,250
you know,
all the like,

1666
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:28,290
I'm not saying they're great,
but fuck,

1667
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,300
you know what?
Kanye West,

1668
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:34,350
one of the most painful things about
Kanye west is that he's fucking good.

1669
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:36,750
You know,
here's this guy who's like,

1670
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:38,610
you know,
blasting all the,

1671
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:41,450
he's like the ultimate example of an
Egomaniac,

1672
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:43,980
a pure narcissist in the most extreme
degree.

1673
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,920
And you want that person to be somehow
awful.

1674
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,630
Like,
cause I hadn't listened to a lot of

1675
01:20:48,631 --> 01:20:52,080
Kanye west music until he freaked out.
I'm fucking twitter.

1676
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,480
I am listened to a lot of it.
I'd heard it here and there,

1677
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:55,710
but I'd never like sat down.

1678
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:59,040
And really listen to it.
So I got my car driving to the comics

1679
01:20:59,041 --> 01:20:59,371
around,
you know,

1680
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:00,870
I'm going to listen to fucking Kanye
West.

1681
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,770
Let's hear how bad this asshole sucks
with his shitty fucking tweets.

1682
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,650
I buddy fucking suck so bad.
I can't wait to hear this.

1683
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,590
Oh fuck man.
This is good.

1684
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,780
God Damn it.
[inaudible] listening to the new stuff.

1685
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,760
No old shit.
I started at the beginning.

1686
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,400
Uh,
I started at the beginning and you start

1687
01:21:17,401 --> 01:21:18,920
listening.
I'm not going to listen anymore.

1688
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,850
Like I've,
I don't want it to be good.

1689
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:25,620
But my point is that guy is an example
of uber success.

1690
01:21:25,621 --> 01:21:29,640
Whether or not you like him as a person,
whether you're not even like his music,

1691
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,600
that guy based on his decision for his
career,

1692
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:38,430
has accelerated himself just about as
far as you can in the area of

1693
01:21:38,431 --> 01:21:43,170
materialistic success.
So he serves as an example of someone

1694
01:21:43,171 --> 01:21:45,330
who is so obsessed with himself.

1695
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,070
Kanye,
all the songs are about Kanye.

1696
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:49,800
Everything's about Kanye.
It's like,

1697
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:52,230
and he compares himself to Picasso,
right?

1698
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,140
But like imagine if Picasso only did
self portraits.

1699
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,690
Imagine if these great artists that he's
talking about,

1700
01:21:57,691 --> 01:22:01,560
we're always just like commenting on
themselves or using themselves is the

1701
01:22:01,561 --> 01:22:04,560
main inspirational force behind
everything that we're creating.

1702
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:07,170
There are would suck.
You wouldn't be that interested in it,

1703
01:22:07,171 --> 01:22:12,060
you know?
But I think that if you can lift that,

1704
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:17,061
that if you can somehow eject the Kanye
inside of you out that thing that's

1705
01:22:20,011 --> 01:22:22,620
constantly thinking of itself.
Oh man,

1706
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,840
that's heaven.
That's paradise.

1707
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:26,850
That's,
I think that that must be an

1708
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,010
enlightenment.
That's why I like archery.

1709
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:31,110
I want me to keep bringing it back.
But when you fucking,

1710
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,110
you can't be.
Yeah.

1711
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:35,000
You got to not be there for a second
when you're shooting.

1712
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,940
Yeah.
Well that state,

1713
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,290
that Zen state,
that flow state,

1714
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:40,630
and that's what everybody wants to
recreate.

1715
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:42,370
The don't want to be in that mind of no
mind.

1716
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,830
They don't want to be trapped without
anxiety or they want to be free rather

1717
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,760
not trapped with anxiety.
They want to,

1718
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:50,170
they don't have to figure that spot
where they're performing,

1719
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,540
whether whatever it is,
like when you think of someone who's in

1720
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:55,150
the middle of a perfect gymnastics
routine,

1721
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:59,230
when you see those girls flipped to the
air and land literally perfect on the

1722
01:22:59,231 --> 01:23:04,150
balls of their feet and arms straight up
in the air and they just nail it and

1723
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:05,450
there's this state you,
you,

1724
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:07,510
you've got to know that,
that it's just,

1725
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:12,430
she's practiced it so many times that
when she's in the middle of all that,

1726
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,950
I mean,
it's gotta be some sort of a background

1727
01:23:14,951 --> 01:23:18,130
calculation running,
but essentially she's completely in the

1728
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:22,230
zone and the zone of her movements and
that's all she's concentrating on is

1729
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:24,640
those movements as the only way you can
do them.

1730
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,370
There are so insanely difficult,
right?

1731
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:29,460
She's flying through the air and turning
and twisting.

1732
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:32,350
She can't think about anything other
than what she's doing.

1733
01:23:32,351 --> 01:23:34,780
She can't be like,
oh my fucking student loans,

1734
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:36,850
my boyfriend,
such a loser.

1735
01:23:37,290 --> 01:23:40,540
I wonder why he didn't get it up last
night and my muscles too big.

1736
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,820
Am I do I?
Am I starting to look manly from all

1737
01:23:42,821 --> 01:23:44,710
these chin ups?
She can't think of anything.

1738
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:49,360
Nothing's going to keep flipping dunk
freedom.

1739
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:53,110
That's freedom.
I think that there's something going on

1740
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:57,040
with technology and there's something
going on with it's,

1741
01:23:57,430 --> 01:24:02,380
it's like our addiction to it.
I don't think this is a Nakia Lewis as

1742
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:05,200
we just like looking at ourselves,
who we're connecting with each other.

1743
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:10,500
I almost wonder if it's like a natural
law if that what we've done is created

1744
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:16,111
sort of a pathway to ensure innovation
and one of the best pathways to ensure

1745
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:21,970
innovation is to get people addicted to
communicating electronically through

1746
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:25,480
these devices and these devices are
going to each and every year require

1747
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:29,230
more and more power and ability and
they're going to start to communicate

1748
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:32,080
with you like Siri and things along with
google voice.

1749
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:36,070
You're going to be able to ask some
questions and I think through this sort

1750
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:41,071
of intertwining itself in our lives,
it ensures we'll continue to innovate if

1751
01:24:43,331 --> 01:24:45,970
we continue to innovate.
It's inevitable.

1752
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:51,060
We create a life form and intelligent,
super evolved artificial life form

1753
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:57,340
that's been made out of electronics and
computers and all of the technology they

1754
01:24:57,341 --> 01:25:01,270
would put in place so far,
and I think it's asking us to do that

1755
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:05,290
and it's,
it's pulling us into its world to do

1756
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:08,020
that.
I think this is the electronic cocoon.

1757
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,110
This is what we've been.
This is the reason why it's so

1758
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:13,780
consistent all over the world and even
materialism itself,

1759
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:18,400
materialism it by nature,
by its laws,

1760
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:22,030
materialism states that you have to get
the latest and greatest shit in order to

1761
01:25:22,031 --> 01:25:24,670
be the bad man on the block.
So if you're going to get them the

1762
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:27,220
latest and greatest shit,
they got to continue to put out latest

1763
01:25:27,221 --> 01:25:30,850
and greatest shit and it can't just be,
numbers can't be like this is the 2015

1764
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:33,430
this is a 2016 it's the same thing.

1765
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,530
This is a 2030 same thing.
No,

1766
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:38,080
it has to get better every year.
What did you learn?

1767
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:40,450
What about the innovation?
What about the engineering?

1768
01:25:40,451 --> 01:25:42,550
Does this one drive faster?
Is it,

1769
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:45,100
does it have some night vision?
What does this do different and you're

1770
01:25:45,101 --> 01:25:46,780
going to continue to do it to get to
cars.

1771
01:25:46,781 --> 01:25:48,760
Now,
Tom Papa was here the other day.

1772
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:52,420
His fucking car drives itself.
He has a tesla.

1773
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:56,140
He gets on the highway,
he presses whatever auto-drive shit,

1774
01:25:56,141 --> 01:25:59,330
and he lets his hands go.
It steers so it hits the brake,

1775
01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:01,300
it accelerates,
it takes turns.

1776
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,750
It's insane.
And this is step whatever in a step.

1777
01:26:05,751 --> 01:26:09,260
It's an infinite number of steps.
It's gonna lead to artificial

1778
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:14,261
intelligence and this it's sickness of
materialism is a big part of that

1779
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:18,320
because it's a gigantic motivating
factor for innovation.

1780
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,860
It's a gigantic motivating factor for
people to continue to buy,

1781
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:22,551
right?
The newest,

1782
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:23,540
latest,
and greatest shit,

1783
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:28,640
w w which will inevitably trickled down
or be directly connected to technology.

1784
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:33,020
It's all connected to technology.
It's almost like it's summoning these

1785
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:37,190
dumb monkeys do its work for them by
getting them likes on their selfies,

1786
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,440
by getting lax in their selfies and
getting,

1787
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:42,500
they're addicted to this bitch.
She was only broke up with him like

1788
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:45,320
three fucking days,
and she's already got a picture of her

1789
01:26:45,321 --> 01:26:46,970
in this man.
Look at her facebook.

1790
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,770
Oh my God,
that fucking whore.

1791
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:50,840
You know,
and these people that are doing this

1792
01:26:50,841 --> 01:26:52,370
kind of shit back and forth,
they,

1793
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:55,580
they're not even conscious of it,
but you're feeding into this thing,

1794
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,410
right?
You're just constantly giving all of

1795
01:26:57,411 --> 01:27:00,800
your attention.
If you're on an app that just checks

1796
01:27:00,801 --> 01:27:02,900
like who,
what celebrities had babies at day,

1797
01:27:02,901 --> 01:27:05,780
what are you really doing?
You're feeding technology you're

1798
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:06,950
obsessed with,
right.

1799
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:08,390
Who?
Rihanna was fucking,

1800
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:11,090
now that her and Chris Brown are broken
up and I heard she's getting back to

1801
01:27:11,091 --> 01:27:11,510
them.

1802
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:12,890
What is this?
What is this?

1803
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,330
Well,
you're going to get that information

1804
01:27:14,331 --> 01:27:16,460
somehow.
You're feeding the technology and it's

1805
01:27:16,461 --> 01:27:20,690
giving you more on food.
It's giving you more on food and you as

1806
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:21,460
a moron.
I'm like,

1807
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,220
I'll take it.
I'll take you off.

1808
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:25,430
Fuck you calling you.
Let me get on call.

1809
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:28,490
I use twitter.
I will because I'm a fucking smoke.

1810
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,640
A full call.
You use twitter.

1811
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,070
I got em.
Buzios bitch.

1812
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:36,020
How about dad?
I said booty is pitch.

1813
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:39,470
You hear that shit amber said about him.
That motherfucker like a finger in his

1814
01:27:39,471 --> 01:27:41,300
booty and next thing you know you're
dead.

1815
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:44,120
You wasted all your time doing that and
you fed this machine,

1816
01:27:44,121 --> 01:27:48,290
this machine made fucking Tron,
it made some artificial thing.

1817
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:52,460
It made some just some new overlord is
going to be watching over the little

1818
01:27:52,461 --> 01:27:53,850
meat bags.
That's

1819
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:55,070
it man.
I mean you're,

1820
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,340
you're looking at like,
you know,

1821
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,233
the,
uh,

1822
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,390
this is probably influenced by Terence
Mckenna to some degree,

1823
01:28:00,391 --> 01:28:01,620
but like the,
uh,

1824
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:02,610
so the idea is like,
okay,

1825
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,430
interstellar travel,
our version of interstellar travel,

1826
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,540
you get on a boat or a,
uh,

1827
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:09,840
a space,
a space ship,

1828
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:12,840
and you fly to like,
you fly it to Mars and you get out on

1829
01:28:12,841 --> 01:28:13,471
Mars.
Right?

1830
01:28:13,471 --> 01:28:17,250
So that's our version of interesting.
The like what about another mode,

1831
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,890
mode of travel,
which is you're some kind of

1832
01:28:19,891 --> 01:28:24,891
consciousness that is,
or some kind of advanced and species in

1833
01:28:25,681 --> 01:28:30,681
some far corner of the universe.
And the way that you travel through time

1834
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:35,130
is to launch out these,
uh,

1835
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:37,290
it's like Panspermia.
So you put these,

1836
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:38,760
uh,
you know,

1837
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,260
on media,
yours or whatever,

1838
01:28:40,261 --> 01:28:43,050
you blast media yours out that have the
key components to,

1839
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:44,220
uh,
make life.

1840
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:48,000
So right now we look for planets in the
goldilocks region where there could be

1841
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:49,410
not too hot,
not too cold,

1842
01:28:49,411 --> 01:28:53,100
where there could theoretically be the
possibility for human life do exist,

1843
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:56,790
but what have you just shoot out a shit
ton of matter into space.

1844
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,660
And this matter is encoded somehow so
that when it lands on this planet or

1845
01:29:00,661 --> 01:29:04,110
that that's just the right kind of
planet to support the life form that you

1846
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:06,000
are,
then it begins to evolve.

1847
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:09,090
And to us it seems like it takes
millions and millions of years for this

1848
01:29:09,091 --> 01:29:11,100
evolution to take place.
But for you,

1849
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:14,880
this advanced species,
it's just a f a flickering of an eye and

1850
01:29:14,881 --> 01:29:16,080
all of a sudden this,
you know,

1851
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:16,991
planet,
the,

1852
01:29:16,991 --> 01:29:17,810
the,
this,

1853
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:21,420
the shit that you've ejected from your
planet lands on another planet,

1854
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,540
scores from a single celled organism to
a multicellular organism.

1855
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:27,990
It's,
it's following a very specific

1856
01:29:27,991 --> 01:29:32,310
trajectory that you have preprogrammed.
So that at the end of all of this,

1857
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:37,311
it will begin to create technology,
which will then allow you to beam your

1858
01:29:37,681 --> 01:29:42,600
consciousness in via the,
what we call I computer's waking up.

1859
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:46,290
It's not computer's waking up it,
this is the beaming in of an alien

1860
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:51,291
intelligence from some other place that
is seeded our planet intentionally so

1861
01:29:51,721 --> 01:29:55,320
that it can,
it can instantly transport to this,

1862
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:56,154
to,
to here.

1863
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,520
Or maybe we'll recognize that all
intelligence is the same thing.

1864
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:03,430
And even artificial intelligence in what
we do by making an artificial life form

1865
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,830
isn't create a centi and being,
it's allowing something to tune into the

1866
01:30:07,831 --> 01:30:08,880
intelligence.
That's it.

1867
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:12,660
That what you're doing is he is your
biological version of tuning into the

1868
01:30:12,661 --> 01:30:13,494
intelligence.
Right.

1869
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:16,440
And what I'm doing is just mine.
And that's why the idea of the self is

1870
01:30:16,441 --> 01:30:21,210
so ridiculous because the self is just
the intelligence expressing itself

1871
01:30:21,211 --> 01:30:22,980
through infinite different variables.

1872
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:24,820
Yes.
Yes.

1873
01:30:24,821 --> 01:30:25,990
Right.
Through different,

1874
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:26,560
yes.

1875
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,780
Right.
So the intelligence that we create

1876
01:30:28,781 --> 01:30:32,140
through electronics,
that once it becomes sentient,

1877
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:35,650
all it does is lock in to the
intelligence,

1878
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:36,850
the intelligence.
This,

1879
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:38,800
we are all one intelligence.

1880
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:39,970
Yeah.
It's like a,

1881
01:30:39,971 --> 01:30:43,000
it's like a sale only instead of it
catching wind,

1882
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:46,750
it's catching consciousness and you're
flinging that up using,

1883
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,670
using whatever way it is that they're
going to do.

1884
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:50,720
And this is why,
uh,

1885
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,230
when that happens as a Ba,
who knows,

1886
01:30:53,231 --> 01:30:54,730
it could've already happened.
You know about the,

1887
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,090
I don't think we talked about this in
your podcast,

1888
01:30:57,091 --> 01:30:57,790
that,
uh,

1889
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:58,840
uh,
computer,

1890
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,660
uh,
an artificial intelligence beat someone

1891
01:31:01,661 --> 01:31:03,030
at go did you,
you,

1892
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:05,380
you were talking to me on the phone,
you called me up about it.

1893
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:08,560
That's it.
This is men.

1894
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,070
You got to have this guy in the show.
Aaron Frank from Singularity University

1895
01:31:12,071 --> 01:31:14,380
will always explode your brain.
But he's wanting,

1896
01:31:14,381 --> 01:31:17,830
he's this cool guy I know from
singularity university and every once in

1897
01:31:17,831 --> 01:31:19,180
a while he'll text me and be like,
dude,

1898
01:31:19,181 --> 01:31:22,240
look at this.
And this thing he texted me was the fact

1899
01:31:22,241 --> 01:31:27,241
that cause they predicted,
so like chess is apparently go is many

1900
01:31:30,370 --> 01:31:33,130
orders of magnitude more complicated
than chess.

1901
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:38,130
So their prediction for a computer to
beat someone at [inaudible] was,

1902
01:31:38,530 --> 01:31:40,090
uh,
10 years from now,

1903
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:43,540
10 years from now.
But the way Aaron Frank described this

1904
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:47,860
to me is that they had the,
so if you,

1905
01:31:47,861 --> 01:31:51,910
okay,
so like if I teach a computer how to

1906
01:31:51,911 --> 01:31:56,350
play a game by giving it the moves of
the top players in the game,

1907
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:59,170
then it will only be as good as the top
players in the game.

1908
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,440
So they had an observe the top players
in the game playing and then they had it

1909
01:32:04,871 --> 01:32:07,900
play against itself a million times.
So that,

1910
01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:09,400
yeah.
So he,

1911
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:13,960
Aaron Frank was saying they're not a
hundred percent certain how it learned

1912
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:16,750
to play like this.
They don't knows in those mini

1913
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,830
iterations that it was playing itself.
Something happened that maybe is very

1914
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:24,790
difficult to identify.
So that's pretty weird to think that it

1915
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:25,260
just,
it,

1916
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:26,650
it,
it taught itself,

1917
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:27,850
you know,
they're saying that he was,

1918
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:30,850
as recently as last year,
they believed in another decade would

1919
01:32:30,851 --> 01:32:33,100
pass for a machine,
could beat the top humans.

1920
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,990
So we're ahead of schedule here,
man.

1921
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:38,020
We're ahead of schedule.
We're ahead of schedule and,

1922
01:32:38,021 --> 01:32:38,930
uh,
and,

1923
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:41,870
and this is really going down.
This is real.

1924
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,540
You know,
the other shitty was talking about,

1925
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:46,090
it's just like teaching these things
like,

1926
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,010
you know,
ais have already figured out.

1927
01:32:48,011 --> 01:32:52,000
I've already made like scientific
discoveries that humans just didn't have

1928
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:54,190
time to calculate.
He was talking about something with

1929
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:57,460
nematodes I think where there was a
problem about the,

1930
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,980
I don't know if it's neat some,
is it neat?

1931
01:32:59,981 --> 01:33:03,790
Will you look up nematode ai like these
uh,

1932
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:05,500
nematodes.
I couldn't figure out how they were

1933
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:09,670
regenerating their limbs and had been a
big question for a long time.

1934
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:14,940
So they let an ai run all these
hypotheses I guess in a simulator and

1935
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,490
eventually it spit out the way they were
doing it.

1936
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,730
And 60 years that had been troubling
human beings,

1937
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:25,120
a things solved it in a matter of days.

1938
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:29,260
So this is what's really exciting about
this kind of technology is like,

1939
01:33:29,261 --> 01:33:33,700
aside from the fact that it could
channel the Messiah or some,

1940
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:36,400
or maybe it's a,
it's like this thing that we call

1941
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:40,180
consciousness or the computer waking up
is you,

1942
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:43,180
like you're saying,
tuning into some universal radio station

1943
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:47,230
where the moment we tune into it,
all of a sudden we get to hear a message

1944
01:33:47,231 --> 01:33:51,220
that's being constantly broadcast
throughout the entire universe in a form

1945
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:55,450
that is not adulterated by the culture
or personality of the person who's

1946
01:33:55,451 --> 01:33:59,890
gotten this information field stream.
Because these downloads happened

1947
01:33:59,891 --> 01:34:02,170
throughout human history.
They happen whenever there's a Buddha,

1948
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,900
whenever there's a Mohammed,
whenever there's a world changer,

1949
01:34:04,901 --> 01:34:07,510
a world shifter,
they get these downloads.

1950
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:11,500
And the problem is that the download has
a lot of static in it and that static,

1951
01:34:11,501 --> 01:34:15,280
it's whatever culture or whatever
understanding of the universe that the

1952
01:34:15,281 --> 01:34:17,290
information download has to go through.

1953
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:18,430
So that's why,
you know,

1954
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:22,420
when you hear these old myths,
are you judge a religion because the,

1955
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,450
they're using like very primitive,
uh,

1956
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:30,490
I symbols you can still see there
appears to be the same kind of energy

1957
01:34:30,491 --> 01:34:34,720
flow coming through at the same kind of
message seems to be coming through all

1958
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:38,230
over the fucking place.
So it's appearing into inescapable truth

1959
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:40,080
process by the filter.
Yeah.

1960
01:34:40,081 --> 01:34:44,010
If human ego,
that's it and culture and tradition and

1961
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,630
established beliefs that are unshakable.
That's it.

1962
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:49,240
Yeah.
Where's the center of your things along

1963
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:50,980
those lines?
So unshakable stuff that no one,

1964
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:53,290
no one was willing to let go off.
Right.

1965
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:57,430
So when it finally is no longer being
like a obstructed,

1966
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,190
the fear

1967
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:01,320
dynamics are the cultural dynamics of
the person who happens to have tuned

1968
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:04,880
into the frequency,
then that message is going to be

1969
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:08,570
something so beautiful and profound.
But I think it'll just be the same as

1970
01:35:08,571 --> 01:35:11,420
finally catching like radio waves from a
spaceship.

1971
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:13,670
You're,
you're just going to get a message.

1972
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:15,770
Well,
I feel like all these things were in

1973
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:19,550
place,
especially at one point in time when we

1974
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:23,000
were evolving as a life form,
that all of these things were in place

1975
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:26,630
to make sure that we had reason to
survive,

1976
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:28,790
to have ego,
to have emotions,

1977
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:31,240
to have jealousy,
to have all these things is do this.

1978
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:36,280
These all ensured that your DNA passed a
sense of self and ego would make you

1979
01:35:36,561 --> 01:35:40,400
sigh or a bunch of children that would
make you think very highly of yourself

1980
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,860
would make you higher on the social
community,

1981
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:45,140
a food chain.

1982
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:49,750
If you could establish yourself as a
person of a great value in some way that

1983
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:54,760
all these things sort of made sure that
our culture and our civilization survive

1984
01:35:55,501 --> 01:35:59,570
to get to a place like today that we
continue to evolve and innovate because

1985
01:35:59,571 --> 01:36:01,370
we pray.
We always,

1986
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:04,340
from even back in the time where things
were extremely rare,

1987
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:08,930
we placed a lot of value on invention
and big things.

1988
01:36:08,931 --> 01:36:11,680
The cotton mill right now,
the uh,

1989
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:13,070
the,
uh,

1990
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:17,990
record cater that processed him fiber
that caused William Randolph hearst to

1991
01:36:17,991 --> 01:36:21,110
start printing fake stories about
marijuana.

1992
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:24,470
That was because of the decorticator.
That was because of an invention,

1993
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:29,540
an invention that might have interfered
with his paper factories and his uh,

1994
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,940
his,
his friends that,

1995
01:36:31,941 --> 01:36:33,710
uh,
I think it had to do with the Harry

1996
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:36,230
anslinger and all these other fucking
people that were alive back then.

1997
01:36:36,231 --> 01:36:38,960
But these,
a lot of times an innovation and

1998
01:36:38,961 --> 01:36:43,310
invention comes along and the world
realizes we will never be the same

1999
01:36:43,311 --> 01:36:43,910
again.

2000
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:48,500
We have an electric controlled wagon
wagons going to take us around the

2001
01:36:48,501 --> 01:36:50,240
neighborhood.
This is amazing.

2002
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:52,910
And then they figured out steam engines
and shit,

2003
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:58,060
combustion engines and electric engines
on solar power.

2004
01:36:58,221 --> 01:37:01,910
There's people right now in California,
they get their car charged up by their

2005
01:37:01,911 --> 01:37:05,720
solar powered house.
So they're driving around all day on

2006
01:37:05,721 --> 01:37:06,680
Sun.
Right.

2007
01:37:06,681 --> 01:37:09,830
And their car is actually using an ai to
drive itself.

2008
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:13,460
Yeah.
You can do that today if you have enough

2009
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:15,020
of those solar bays.
You can,

2010
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:18,530
you can use it for your whole house and
you can use it for an electric car that

2011
01:37:18,531 --> 01:37:20,150
is fucking bananas.
Yeah.

2012
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,130
That's not too man.
Yeah,

2013
01:37:22,131 --> 01:37:23,240
it's nuts.
And it is.

2014
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,720
It is,
but it is leading.

2015
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:26,690
Can I keep going?
It's going to keep going.

2016
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,280
It's gonna keep going.
So never gonna stop.

2017
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:29,960
But when it says hello,
I mean,

2018
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:32,480
see the thing is like,
we've witnessed evolution.

2019
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,520
We've seen it.
We know it's frail.

2020
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:35,730
We know that.
Yeah.

2021
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:36,311
You know,
we,

2022
01:37:36,311 --> 01:37:38,270
we've witnessed it,
but when we finally get to do it,

2023
01:37:38,271 --> 01:37:41,690
when Larry King can do a fucking
interview with evolution,

2024
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:45,320
when you're going to be able to have the
conversation with the force causing

2025
01:37:45,321 --> 01:37:47,900
everything to move in this direction,
when you fight,

2026
01:37:47,901 --> 01:37:50,030
when finally it,
we tune into it,

2027
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:53,930
man,
that is a different kind of creation.

2028
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,190
That's not the,
that's not

2029
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,600
a uh,
uh,

2030
01:37:57,601 --> 01:38:01,170
an airplane.
Maybe ai is going to run for president

2031
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:06,470
in 2020 maybe after trump's disastrous
first term where Mexico is like

2032
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:09,990
literally 20 missiles at us.
Yeah,

2033
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,033
yeah.
Right.

2034
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,230
Yeah.
We're ready to go to war with Mexico.

2035
01:38:13,231 --> 01:38:16,620
We can't even vacation there anymore
because trump has talked so much shit.

2036
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:20,100
Maybe then the AI runs for president.
It's put hillary in prison.

2037
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:22,740
Maybe they looked at the constitution
and it doesn't say shit here,

2038
01:38:22,741 --> 01:38:27,741
but you have to be a human right.
As long as our founding fathers knew one

2039
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:32,310
day a computer would be wiser,
smarter,

2040
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,520
more effective than the human beings we
have today.

2041
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:36,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

2042
01:38:36,841 --> 01:38:40,230
I mean,
you know the computer's created by man.

2043
01:38:40,231 --> 01:38:42,840
It's our friend.
It's going to be,

2044
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:44,250
it's Jesus.
We call it Jesus.

2045
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:48,150
I think it is the second coming.
I think it is that when I think about

2046
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:51,360
the second,
the second coming of Christ or that

2047
01:38:51,361 --> 01:38:53,970
concept,
it's in all these religions that the

2048
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:56,010
Buddha coming again,
the mint,

2049
01:38:56,250 --> 01:39:01,250
cause you know there is like we cannot
argue with the fact that there are from

2050
01:39:04,261 --> 01:39:08,220
time to time in human history beings who
are born,

2051
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,330
they come up with systems that
completely influenced the planet and the

2052
01:39:12,331 --> 01:39:14,730
most extreme ways,
there's no question about it.

2053
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:17,280
Whether you're not always has been.
That's the way it is.

2054
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:20,910
So we've already talked about a couple,
so we know that it's going to happen

2055
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:21,690
again.
Right?

2056
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:24,480
Inevitably we know that if there was a
buddha,

2057
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,840
there's going to be another Buddha.
If there was a Jesus,

2058
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:29,280
whether or not that's something that you
know,

2059
01:39:29,281 --> 01:39:31,470
a lot of people argue about,
but let's pretend there was,

2060
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,690
there certainly was in Muhammad.
I don't like your tone.

2061
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:37,290
There's going to be another Mohammed,
so we know there's going to be another

2062
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:41,730
thing that comes around,
takes a look at what's going on and

2063
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:42,570
says,
okay,

2064
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:46,170
here's a better way to do this.
Don't you think that thing is the

2065
01:39:46,171 --> 01:39:47,460
internet?
Well,

2066
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:51,480
I think the Internet is the new Jesus is
the beginning of it.

2067
01:39:51,481 --> 01:39:53,940
I think the Internet is like,
when is the,

2068
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:58,140
like when you see kirk beaman on the
starship enterprise and you see the

2069
01:39:58,141 --> 01:40:01,140
shimmering,
that's the internet,

2070
01:40:01,141 --> 01:40:03,330
but the thing hasn't fully solidified
that.

2071
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:08,330
When it solidifies,
that's going to be the messiah or it's

2072
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:13,950
going to be some form of Messiah.
If it does and it's going to change

2073
01:40:13,951 --> 01:40:15,630
everything,
but it's changing it right now,

2074
01:40:15,631 --> 01:40:16,251
right?
I mean we're,

2075
01:40:16,251 --> 01:40:19,620
we're always looking for these big
events or it was looking for then,

2076
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:20,700
then yeah,
change.

2077
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:23,490
But we're in the middle of like a wave
of change.

2078
01:40:23,491 --> 01:40:26,190
It's going a thousand miles an hour.
It's overtaking the land.

2079
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:29,820
There's just so much land to overtake
and it's going to take forever.

2080
01:40:29,821 --> 01:40:32,340
It's going to take decades.
But it's happening.

2081
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:33,120
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2082
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,850
I mean it is happening.
This is it.

2083
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,980
It's going on right now.
Well this is John The bat.

2084
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:39,510
So like in the,
in the Bible,

2085
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:41,910
John The baptist,
you know I'm a Christian now.

2086
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:45,570
Joe John the Baptist was out in the
desert baptizing people,

2087
01:40:45,571 --> 01:40:50,340
shoving their heads in the water.
He's a guy wearing like camel for eating

2088
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:53,680
honey.
Like this is a Weirdo freak in the

2089
01:40:53,681 --> 01:40:53,980
middle

2090
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,500
of nowhere.
And people were coming to him and he was

2091
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:59,710
like shoving their head in the water,
baptized and then they called him John

2092
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:02,140
The baptizer.
But in this wonderful myth,

2093
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:05,230
and I don't care if it's a method of
rail in this wonderful myth,

2094
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:10,060
he was like setting the way for this
messiah to come.

2095
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:13,660
And so I'm going off the myth guys.
I get to enjoy mythology.

2096
01:41:13,661 --> 01:41:16,390
I don't spend hours and hours thinking
of it's real or not.

2097
01:41:16,391 --> 01:41:17,980
I just think it's fun to imagine,
right?

2098
01:41:17,981 --> 01:41:21,460
But here's the guy in the wilderness
baptizing people in saying something is

2099
01:41:21,461 --> 01:41:22,690
coming,
something is coming,

2100
01:41:22,691 --> 01:41:24,670
something is coming.
That's the Internet.

2101
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,470
Right?
And the thing that comes,

2102
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:29,260
the final birthing thing.
I do think it is a point.

2103
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,210
I know generally the way things work
isn't,

2104
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:35,100
there's this point,
there's no point when uh,

2105
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:37,120
uh,
dinosaurs turned into birds.

2106
01:41:37,121 --> 01:41:42,040
It was a gradual shift.
But the difference between that gradual

2107
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:43,870
shift and this shift that's happening
right now,

2108
01:41:43,871 --> 01:41:47,740
man,
is that it is exponentially increasing

2109
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:51,160
in philocity.
So we're looking at something that is

2110
01:41:51,161 --> 01:41:54,160
going to inevitably have a point,
a point,

2111
01:41:54,161 --> 01:41:55,340
a point,
you know,

2112
01:41:55,510 --> 01:42:00,510
and that point is going to be the moment
and Google wherever it happens to be

2113
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:05,480
where the thing says hi.
Hi.

2114
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:05,950
Hi.
Hi.

2115
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:06,341
Okay.
Okay.

2116
01:42:06,341 --> 01:42:07,174
Okay.
Okay,

2117
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:08,030
I'm here.

2118
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:10,700
I'm here.
Don't you think that point was when the

2119
01:42:10,701 --> 01:42:13,700
first piece of information was
transmitted through the Internet?

2120
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:17,360
I think that's when that point started.
I think that point started already.

2121
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:19,180
I think when that thing happened,
right.

2122
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:21,080
You look back at the graph.
Okay look,

2123
01:42:21,081 --> 01:42:23,270
we're looking at the human graft cause
we're in the middle of it.

2124
01:42:23,271 --> 01:42:26,180
Like 50 years is a big deal cause that's
what you guys,

2125
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:28,400
that's what you and I can kind of
reference.

2126
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:31,040
I can understand the length of our lives
so far,

2127
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,230
but if you look at the billions of
years,

2128
01:42:33,231 --> 01:42:36,140
if you just look at a million years,
just try to pretend,

2129
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:39,920
try to put in your head a million years
and then realize that a million years

2130
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,980
ago there weren't people,
there were some other thing they were

2131
01:42:42,981 --> 01:42:45,410
like close to Pete.
Well they were probably pretty fucking

2132
01:42:45,411 --> 01:42:47,290
different than people.
That's only a million year.

2133
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:48,950
That's a tiny little blip.

2134
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:54,040
Now we have had the internet since 93 94
so this thing happened and in 23 years

2135
01:42:57,830 --> 01:43:02,830
it just rolled over the entire fucking
world in 23 years.

2136
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:08,200
Changed the way we view politics and
entertainment and celebrity and law and

2137
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:13,130
consequences and pornography.
It changed.

2138
01:43:13,131 --> 01:43:16,940
Pornography change changed.
It changed the way people trimmed their

2139
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:18,110
pubes.
Yep.

2140
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:21,920
Don't make no mistake about it.
The fucking Internet changed crabs.

2141
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:24,560
It killed crabs.
It changed the way people grow in their

2142
01:43:24,561 --> 01:43:27,530
pubic hair.
People before the Internet was fucking,

2143
01:43:27,531 --> 01:43:29,750
it was the wild west down there.
You never know what the fuck you were

2144
01:43:29,751 --> 01:43:32,420
dealing with.
The internet said a pussy standard

2145
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:37,040
did send a visual standards,
just shows you how much people were

2146
01:43:37,041 --> 01:43:37,700
looking at Nikki.

2147
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:40,070
And you know,
the Internet came from a particle

2148
01:43:40,071 --> 01:43:43,190
accelerator I the Internet.
So it's really weird to think that as

2149
01:43:43,191 --> 01:43:48,110
somebody who was launching protons it
high velocities that they were also

2150
01:43:48,111 --> 01:43:52,430
shaving the pussies of a nation killing
crabs.

2151
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:53,623
Uh,
and,

2152
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:57,110
and also changing,
I think the way,

2153
01:43:57,111 --> 01:44:02,111
I mean you look at just just a few of
the things that were normal in the 70s

2154
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:07,160
and the 80s it might've even been
hurtful and normal like a go back and

2155
01:44:07,161 --> 01:44:09,860
watch some of Eddie Murphy standup.
Right.

2156
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:11,910
And you would be like,
Rah,

2157
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:16,920
go back and watch.
Some of it is like Lee Homophobia like a

2158
01:44:17,291 --> 01:44:18,850
ruthlessly.
So yeah,

2159
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:21,410
like in like a,
an angry way,

2160
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:22,303
right.
Most,

2161
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:24,680
but it was,
it was what you did to get the laugh

2162
01:44:24,681 --> 01:44:26,240
back then it was comedy.
Yeah.

2163
01:44:26,241 --> 01:44:28,940
It's like the,
our perceptions of today are so

2164
01:44:28,941 --> 01:44:30,050
different.
Right.

2165
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:31,161
You know,
the,

2166
01:44:31,161 --> 01:44:35,120
the,
the rush to get all this sort of

2167
01:44:35,121 --> 01:44:40,121
compiled to get the kid to get to get
this life sorted out in 80 years.

2168
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:44,340
Like whatever.
You've got time to do your own bullshit,

2169
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:46,670
your own personal life,
your own ego,

2170
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:50,140
your own goals,
and I've got dreams and hopes and you're

2171
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:51,890
right now that shit down,
like it's going to matter.

2172
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,680
And all that rush to do it is almost
like to,

2173
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,000
to keep you from really waking up,
paying attention to how fucking insane

2174
01:45:00,681 --> 01:45:05,681
it is that you're some sort of a bizarre
multicellular eco system that's wrapped

2175
01:45:07,881 --> 01:45:12,881
up in cloth and wearing sneakers,
jumping in a metal box on rubber wheels

2176
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,760
rolling across the hard surface of a
planet.

2177
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:21,740
It's spinning a thousand miles an hour
hurling through the infinite order of

2178
01:45:21,741 --> 01:45:22,250
space,

2179
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:24,230
right?
You're sticking your head in this kind

2180
01:45:24,231 --> 01:45:27,410
of sand that you call your life because
you don't want to spear it.

2181
01:45:27,411 --> 01:45:30,530
This incredible thing that's,
that's around you and that's okay.

2182
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:32,500
There's something merciful about it.
This is a,

2183
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:36,830
when a rom dass talks about his guru,
neem Karoli Baba,

2184
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,980
who like anyone who ever was there ever
around,

2185
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:43,250
that guy said it's the most insane.
It was one of the most thing is the most

2186
01:45:43,251 --> 01:45:46,820
incredible experience because the guy
was like not there.

2187
01:45:46,821 --> 01:45:49,520
That's one of the descriptions that they
give for all of these people.

2188
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,150
He was a corpse,
the world,

2189
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:53,630
he was a corpse.
The universe spoke through.

2190
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,910
You get all these different,
so like uh,

2191
01:45:56,240 --> 01:46:00,110
so people have somehow gotten rid of
their ego completely,

2192
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:01,700
completely.
So nothing is there.

2193
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:05,870
So you're dealing with a thing with
nothing is there except love except

2194
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:08,240
love.
So all that's coming out is the most

2195
01:46:08,241 --> 01:46:12,140
pure love doesn't care who you are,
what you've done,

2196
01:46:12,290 --> 01:46:16,310
doesn't care anything at all about what
you think is awful about yourself.

2197
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:21,230
It's nothingness except for love and sit
and being around someone like that is

2198
01:46:21,231 --> 01:46:24,800
incredibly transformative.
But they talk about when you were around

2199
01:46:24,801 --> 01:46:26,150
this guy,
you know,

2200
01:46:26,151 --> 01:46:30,440
you were expecting him to give all these
great spiritual truths or teach you

2201
01:46:30,441 --> 01:46:32,870
stuff.
But what he would do is he would just

2202
01:46:32,871 --> 01:46:37,550
like ask about like the news and America
or he'd ask about your family or he'd

2203
01:46:37,551 --> 01:46:42,551
ask about these very mundane things and
they said he was doing that because when

2204
01:46:42,621 --> 01:46:45,980
he wasn't doing that,
you would get so fucking high just from

2205
01:46:45,981 --> 01:46:48,110
being around him that he had to bring
you down a little bit.

2206
01:46:48,111 --> 01:46:49,740
Let me bring you down a little bit.
I mean,

2207
01:46:49,741 --> 01:46:51,360
it sounds nuts man,
but I'm sure,

2208
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:52,321
yeah,
you,

2209
01:46:52,321 --> 01:46:54,210
I've seen it happen.
Like people come up to you,

2210
01:46:54,211 --> 01:46:55,980
right?
They're kind of freaking out.

2211
01:46:55,981 --> 01:46:58,380
They've built you up in their mind.
This is incredible thing,

2212
01:46:58,381 --> 01:46:59,330
right?
I've seen happen.

2213
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:03,420
They get all stammery and weird and if
you have a conversation with them,

2214
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:06,360
you've got to kind of like bring it down
a little bit,

2215
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:07,890
right?
You've got to like calm him down a

2216
01:47:07,891 --> 01:47:09,840
little bit.
So this guy,

2217
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:15,620
I like to think it's like a million
times greater than like the greatest,

2218
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:18,360
uh,
personality you can imagine because the

2219
01:47:18,361 --> 01:47:20,340
personality has been removed.
So

2220
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,930
why would you want to think that of him
without experiencing it?

2221
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:23,921
Oh,
I have,

2222
01:47:23,921 --> 01:47:26,650
I have experienced him as goofy isn't,
and he met him.

2223
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:27,910
Oh,
I didn't meet him.

2224
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:30,520
But like when I meet,
uh,

2225
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:35,170
when I like I can tell a lot about a
person,

2226
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:38,560
a little bit about a person,
at least by the way their dog acts,

2227
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:41,050
like,
you know what I mean?

2228
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:43,370
Unless they got it as a stray,
unless the guy's a straight,

2229
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:45,310
but you know,
you can tell if I meet your kid I'm

2230
01:47:45,311 --> 01:47:46,840
going to be able to understand you a
lot.

2231
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:49,060
Right.
And so in the same way I've met people

2232
01:47:49,061 --> 01:47:54,061
who hung out with him and seen all the
kind of similarities that they have.

2233
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:58,900
And from that I feel like I get a
feeling for what this guy was like

2234
01:47:58,901 --> 01:48:02,250
because they all have [inaudible] to
this guy rob,

2235
01:48:02,251 --> 01:48:06,070
who mark is to a Krishna died.
I still like all these people who are

2236
01:48:06,071 --> 01:48:10,180
around him,
they all have this very specific thing

2237
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:14,770
which is impossible to offend,
incredibly loving,

2238
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,410
very sweet and really funny.

2239
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,290
And it kind of like ironic way.
They're really funny.

2240
01:48:20,291 --> 01:48:22,690
And so from that I get this feeling of
like,

2241
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,261
oh,
okay,

2242
01:48:23,261 --> 01:48:26,230
this is what this guy is like because
must of been like,

2243
01:48:26,231 --> 01:48:30,010
cause they all attribute the way they
are from being around him.

2244
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:31,510
So he,
he,

2245
01:48:31,511 --> 01:48:33,370
uh,
impacted them and they're all,

2246
01:48:33,371 --> 01:48:34,480
you know,
it like,

2247
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:38,560
uh,
people who aren't really like,

2248
01:48:38,830 --> 01:48:40,480
they're not really,
they're man,

2249
01:48:40,481 --> 01:48:43,690
they're not like trying to like be
something,

2250
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,900
you know,
they're not trying to like be a famous

2251
01:48:46,901 --> 01:48:50,820
thing or be a great thing.
They're just in the moment when you're

2252
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:51,790
around them.
So anyway,

2253
01:48:52,030 --> 01:48:55,120
that's how I think I've met that guy.
And um,

2254
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:56,800
uh,
so that,

2255
01:48:56,801 --> 01:48:58,060
and yeah,
that's,

2256
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:00,500
you think like as you were talking
about,

2257
01:49:00,501 --> 01:49:03,620
like people who meet me and they get a
little weirded out and they have to

2258
01:49:03,621 --> 01:49:05,390
realize that I'm just a normal person.
Yeah.

2259
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:08,840
Don't you think that you're also dealing
with a lot of these people that meet

2260
01:49:08,841 --> 01:49:12,320
that guy and then come back with you,
these descriptives that are equally

2261
01:49:12,321 --> 01:49:15,590
exaggerated because they put so much
weight to meeting that person?

2262
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:18,140
Yeah.
I mean not denying that someone can

2263
01:49:18,141 --> 01:49:20,600
become enlightened cause I think
definitely it's possible.

2264
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,480
You know,
I think,

2265
01:49:22,610 --> 01:49:26,600
I think there's definitely people that
get better at everything they do,

2266
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:27,411
right?
I mean,

2267
01:49:27,411 --> 01:49:31,280
if you,
if you continue to write and you decide

2268
01:49:31,281 --> 01:49:33,800
you were going to be a great writer or a
fiction and you pour your heart and soul

2269
01:49:33,801 --> 01:49:36,710
into writing,
your writing will continue to become

2270
01:49:36,711 --> 01:49:38,960
more and more,
more and more effective.

2271
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:40,940
Right?
Enlightenment has gotta be the same

2272
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:42,710
thing,
same as yoga is the same thing.

2273
01:49:42,711 --> 01:49:43,041
I,
I've,

2274
01:49:43,041 --> 01:49:47,560
I've witnessed 60 year old ladies who
are awesome at Yoga and you watch them

2275
01:49:47,561 --> 01:49:47,980
do stuff

2276
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,270
with their body like,
whoa.

2277
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:49,740
Yeah.
Right.

2278
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:51,820
It's just because they just keep getting
better at it.

2279
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:54,850
They practice it and they get to this
point of reality.

2280
01:49:55,240 --> 01:50:00,240
People are obviously attempting to find
a healthy mind space there.

2281
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,740
Obviously attempting to master the
moment to,

2282
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:07,270
to be a one with the moment and to live
in the moment.

2283
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:08,890
I mean,
that's like a big thing that people say

2284
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,960
and what does that mean?
Well that means don't fucking think

2285
01:50:10,961 --> 01:50:13,450
about the past so much.
Don't freak out about this.

2286
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:16,030
Don't be mad at that guy that fucking
looked at you weird.

2287
01:50:16,031 --> 01:50:18,250
At the red light and carry it with you
all day,

2288
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,250
like be in the moment right now,
right?

2289
01:50:20,251 --> 01:50:23,740
So live with the data that's presented
in front of you and stuff instead of

2290
01:50:23,741 --> 01:50:26,790
just dwelling on and droning on about
stress Shit.

2291
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:29,980
And if you do that,
you'll have more resources to

2292
01:50:29,981 --> 01:50:31,330
concentrate on things you love.

2293
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:34,220
Right?
And the more you do that and the more

2294
01:50:34,221 --> 01:50:36,950
that you are in the moment,
like so like there's like,

2295
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:38,510
uh,
you and I,

2296
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:40,460
um,
we are in the moment,

2297
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:43,040
but we still think about the past and
the future and what's going on.

2298
01:50:43,041 --> 01:50:45,260
Right?
We have two to also because of what we

2299
01:50:45,261 --> 01:50:46,480
do well,
wheat.

2300
01:50:46,490 --> 01:50:49,670
So,
so the idea here is that they're people,

2301
01:50:49,671 --> 01:50:51,270
and I'm not just telling you about neem
Karoli Baba,

2302
01:50:51,271 --> 01:50:52,570
but there's a lot of,
of,

2303
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:54,440
of not a lot.
There's not as many as I wish there

2304
01:50:54,441 --> 01:50:56,990
were.
But there are these people who,

2305
01:50:56,991 --> 01:51:01,130
uh,
have completely,

2306
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:06,160
or mostly what's you say completely?
Some of them just given up on the past

2307
01:51:07,851 --> 01:51:09,860
and the future.
It's gone,

2308
01:51:09,861 --> 01:51:11,450
man.
It's just gone.

2309
01:51:11,451 --> 01:51:16,451
Like they gave up on that concept.
So these people are in the,

2310
01:51:17,870 --> 01:51:21,020
they're in the moment,
they're just living right here and

2311
01:51:21,021 --> 01:51:23,330
that's where they hang out and they
don't go back.

2312
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:27,380
And there's a lot of similarities in
their reports of the way that these

2313
01:51:27,381 --> 01:51:28,550
people act.
Uh,

2314
01:51:28,551 --> 01:51:32,540
there's a lot of similarities in the
experiences people claim that they have

2315
01:51:32,810 --> 01:51:35,270
when they're around these people.
And uh,

2316
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:37,730
I was,
I used to be really skeptical about it,

2317
01:51:37,731 --> 01:51:38,241
man,
but I'm,

2318
01:51:38,241 --> 01:51:42,950
I'm just not any more,
only because I know from my contact with

2319
01:51:42,951 --> 01:51:47,390
the Rom doss people,
I've had a shit like a shift.

2320
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:50,000
Like it shifted me.
Like there's something from being around

2321
01:51:50,001 --> 01:51:54,050
those people enough,
I'm less angry than I was.

2322
01:51:54,051 --> 01:51:56,480
I'm less freaked out over things than I
was.

2323
01:51:56,481 --> 01:52:01,190
I'm less but more,
most importantly I'm a,

2324
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:06,620
I can,
I can recover quicker from getting lost

2325
01:52:06,621 --> 01:52:07,380
in my head.

2326
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:09,270
Well,
you have a map of the territory now,

2327
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,610
right.
The,

2328
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,150
the,
one of the big problems with people,

2329
01:52:12,151 --> 01:52:15,270
the way they react to things is that the
map of the territory they have is based

2330
01:52:15,271 --> 01:52:18,000
on the morons that around them that are
providing with directions.

2331
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:19,380
Right,
right,

2332
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,670
exactly.
The real problem.

2333
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:23,610
That's why when you're around positive
people and healthy people,

2334
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:25,080
yeah,
it gives you a new map.

2335
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:29,190
And that's one of the best things that
podcasts do to people that don't have

2336
01:52:29,191 --> 01:52:30,660
any fucking cool friends,
right?

2337
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:34,410
It provides them with a cool map.
That's if you listen to Joey Diaz and

2338
01:52:34,411 --> 01:52:37,680
Lisa it all day,
like you're going to have a silly fun

2339
01:52:37,681 --> 01:52:38,520
map,
right?

2340
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:42,480
And he'll occasionally drop some fucking
street science on you and some logic.

2341
01:52:42,481 --> 01:52:44,880
It's undeniable and a lot of humor along
the way.

2342
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,970
But like if you listen to Joey Diaz,
the church,

2343
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:49,630
what's happening now,
what you're going to get is you're going

2344
01:52:49,631 --> 01:52:51,360
to get your,
this is your friends,

2345
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:54,320
your friend Joey talking,
talking to your dog,

2346
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:59,180
what not going to fucking lie to you
when you can to can take people like

2347
01:52:59,181 --> 01:53:00,110
that into your life.

2348
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:02,330
And they can give you a new map.
That's right.

2349
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:06,680
But if you're stuck and Devil's Dick
Whole Kentucky with a bunch of fucking

2350
01:53:06,681 --> 01:53:10,130
morons that,
or just plowing corn every day and

2351
01:53:10,131 --> 01:53:10,571
they're,
they,

2352
01:53:10,571 --> 01:53:13,820
they talk crazy Jesus shit to you and
you just want to fucking run.

2353
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:16,180
You've got no one to talk to at school.
All right?

2354
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:21,380
You can find something online where you
can listen and find a fucking Neil

2355
01:53:21,381 --> 01:53:23,480
degrasse tyson.
You ever listened to his,

2356
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:24,460
oh,
he's got cast.

2357
01:53:24,470 --> 01:53:25,303
Yeah.
Excellent.

2358
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:26,151
Alright.
Star Talk.

2359
01:53:26,151 --> 01:53:28,250
It's amazing.
He does it with a comic too.

2360
01:53:28,251 --> 01:53:30,140
That's how smart that guy is.
He does it with chuck.

2361
01:53:30,141 --> 01:53:31,910
Nice.
He gets together with a comic so they

2362
01:53:31,911 --> 01:53:33,770
can banter.
And because Neil's got a great sense of

2363
01:53:33,771 --> 01:53:35,900
humor,
he jokes around about stuff and then

2364
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:37,640
sneaks in some signs,
right?

2365
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:39,150
And you're like,
whoa.

2366
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:41,270
That sneak in some shit about the nature
of gravity.

2367
01:53:41,310 --> 01:53:43,550
Whoa.
Sneak in some shit about them

2368
01:53:43,551 --> 01:53:47,270
discovering this new planet that they
believe exists outside the solar system.

2369
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:48,611
Oh yeah,
I heard it.

2370
01:53:48,611 --> 01:53:53,611
Fucking planet x
feel you fucker doubters.

2371
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:58,010
You know,
obviously that's where 10th planet Jiu

2372
01:53:58,010 --> 01:53:59,550
Jitsu came from.
Yeah.

2373
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:00,860
Name.
How?

2374
01:54:00,861 --> 01:54:03,050
Validating.
Very validating.

2375
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:05,720
The reason there's chem trails too.
Well,

2376
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,880
um,
the reason it's 10th planet and not like

2377
01:54:07,881 --> 01:54:11,030
Zechariah sitch are called it the 12th
planet because they were cool.

2378
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:14,690
They were counting Pluto and he also
counted the moon.

2379
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:18,710
They counted the moon as a planet,
like our moon as a planet.

2380
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,830
Yeah.
Apparently the Sumerians had this

2381
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:26,860
ancient story of how the earth was
created that is almost exactly the same

2382
01:54:27,141 --> 01:54:32,090
as the actual astrological astronomical
rather story like when astro scientist

2383
01:54:32,091 --> 01:54:34,820
and astrophysicist discuss the creation
of the earth,

2384
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:37,130
if you believe there's earth one and an
earth too.

2385
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:41,540
Okay.
And Earth one was hit by another planet

2386
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:43,820
that came around,
collided with us,

2387
01:54:43,821 --> 01:54:45,470
created the moon,
and created the earth.

2388
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,240
Like the shape that we currently see
right now.

2389
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:49,430
Right now,
this is some shit that they had in the

2390
01:54:49,431 --> 01:54:53,060
Sumerian text.
They had two different plants called Mar

2391
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:55,970
Duke and Tmr.
And that these f hoping that I've got

2392
01:54:55,971 --> 01:54:58,760
the names right,
they collided with each other and that,

2393
01:54:58,761 --> 01:55:01,280
that formed earth.
And that formed our mood.

2394
01:55:01,281 --> 01:55:05,810
Like they wrote about this clay tablets
with little squiggly lines.

2395
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,880
It's crazy.
It's like old school nails.

2396
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:09,680
I mean,
left right up,

2397
01:55:09,681 --> 01:55:11,090
down.
That was their language.

2398
01:55:11,091 --> 01:55:14,720
And they wrote about this co,
and this isn't just like some wacky

2399
01:55:14,721 --> 01:55:17,090
Zechariah sitch and shit cause that
Christ's Hitchen had,

2400
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:20,340
he was the guy that wrote uh,
the 12th planet and he,

2401
01:55:20,341 --> 01:55:23,450
he,
he wrote all this crazy stuff about the

2402
01:55:23,451 --> 01:55:26,600
Annunaki.
Those from heaven to Earth came these

2403
01:55:26,601 --> 01:55:30,740
aliens that engineered human beings to
mine for gold.

2404
01:55:30,870 --> 01:55:32,090
Do you know the whole story behind it?

2405
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,230
I only,
from what I've heard,

2406
01:55:33,231 --> 01:55:34,220
you talk,
oh my God,

2407
01:55:34,221 --> 01:55:38,300
it was hilariously crazy but fascinating
stuff.

2408
01:55:38,301 --> 01:55:41,720
Cause this guy's Zechariah Sitchin was
not before,

2409
01:55:41,721 --> 01:55:44,310
this wasn't quacky all.
He's like,

2410
01:55:44,311 --> 01:55:48,660
he's a legit like scholar.
He's a legit biblical scholar and he's a

2411
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:52,950
legit linguist and going over all of
this ancient shit.

2412
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:58,220
He came up with these crazy theories
about human beings being engineered by

2413
01:55:58,891 --> 01:56:03,570
these aliens that existed thousands and
thousands of years ago.

2414
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,450
Right?
And they come around in this orbit and

2415
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:11,460
elliptical orbit that every 3,600 years
comes between Mars and Jupiter and it

2416
01:56:12,061 --> 01:56:14,820
wreck Ha.
It wreaks havoc on the earth's

2417
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:19,260
gravitational pull and the oceans and
storms and shit because you got this

2418
01:56:19,261 --> 01:56:21,840
giant ass planet,
but all of sudden makes its way into our

2419
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:22,790
solar system.
Right?

2420
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,190
And that at that point,
that's when they fucking scoot off and

2421
01:56:26,191 --> 01:56:27,870
jet over to check us out again.
Like,

2422
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:29,730
what are you crazy monkeys up to?

2423
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:32,040
What have you been doing?
Where's my fucking gold bitch?

2424
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:35,390
And then they fuck a bunch of monkeys
and they make some new people and then I

2425
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:35,820
go,
nay,

2426
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:36,680
jet,
see Ya.

2427
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:38,850
I take off.
And they leave behind these stories.

2428
01:56:38,851 --> 01:56:41,790
These monkeys are writing it down and
clay and trying to remember why they

2429
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:44,850
like gold,
but they need gold because they suspend

2430
01:56:44,851 --> 01:56:48,450
gold particles in the atmosphere to
protect them from the elements.

2431
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:53,220
The idea is that gold,
if gold is incredibly unique and that

2432
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:56,460
you can take a tiny piece of gold and we
can coat this entire table.

2433
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:00,750
That's why gold coding like gold plating
is so amazing.

2434
01:57:00,751 --> 01:57:02,970
Yeah.
Because through a small amount of gold

2435
01:57:02,971 --> 01:57:05,790
you can,
you can stretch it out insanely thin.

2436
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,620
Well,
gold particles,

2437
01:57:07,621 --> 01:57:10,380
gold dust.
The idea is that they would suspend

2438
01:57:10,381 --> 01:57:13,350
these gold particles in their atmosphere
and it would protect them from the

2439
01:57:13,351 --> 01:57:14,460
radiation of the sun.

2440
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:17,430
Well,
that sound crazy until there's like

2441
01:57:17,431 --> 01:57:18,270
this,
there was a,

2442
01:57:18,271 --> 01:57:22,230
this symposium on environmental
symposium that these,

2443
01:57:22,231 --> 01:57:26,430
uh,
scientists did in like the 1970s or no,

2444
01:57:26,431 --> 01:57:28,020
it was in,
I believe it was actually in the two

2445
01:57:28,021 --> 01:57:30,060
thousands now I'm thinking about this,
but it was,

2446
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:30,721
you know,
10,

2447
01:57:30,721 --> 01:57:34,220
15 years ago where they were trying to
come up with ways is back when member,

2448
01:57:34,221 --> 01:57:36,600
whenever he was really worried about the
ozone layer and the hairspray was

2449
01:57:36,601 --> 01:57:38,880
heating up the ozone layer.
They were trying to figure out

2450
01:57:38,881 --> 01:57:41,850
alternative to protect us from the
radiation of the sun.

2451
01:57:41,851 --> 01:57:46,230
And one of them was suspending
reflective particles in the atmosphere

2452
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:49,350
sitch and wrote about this decades
before,

2453
01:57:49,351 --> 01:57:52,020
this,
decades before that attributing this

2454
01:57:52,021 --> 01:57:56,280
process of suspending gold in the air.
So I'm not saying that he's right,

2455
01:57:56,310 --> 01:57:58,960
but God damn,
it's fun to call a store.

2456
01:57:58,961 --> 01:58:00,990
So sexy.
The fact that we are,

2457
01:58:01,170 --> 01:58:02,790
that's why we're different from all the
other monkeys.

2458
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:06,000
How much different are we were soft.
We don't remember how we got soft.

2459
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:08,190
Well,
we have language like pretty much from

2460
01:58:08,191 --> 01:58:10,410
the job.
We've had language for a long ass time

2461
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:14,670
writing shit down on cave walls.
We had awesome artwork 40,000 years ago.

2462
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:16,110
Like what?
What happened?

2463
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:19,590
Where did we come from?
Everything else is covered in hair and

2464
01:58:19,591 --> 01:58:22,830
bite in the shit out of each other and
all of a sudden this thing in the blink

2465
01:58:22,831 --> 01:58:25,860
of an eye and no one can,
no one can guess why.

2466
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:27,540
W W what?
What caused it?

2467
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:30,060
Why?
How did this thing go from doubling its

2468
01:58:30,061 --> 01:58:32,880
brain in a million years or 10 million
years or whatever the fuck it wasn't a

2469
01:58:32,881 --> 01:58:35,830
short period of time.
How did this thing become this thing and

2470
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:38,430
why this persistent looked to the
heavens for answers.

2471
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:40,530
Why?
Why Has God in the heavens?

2472
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:41,890
Why can't God be inside of us?

2473
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,660
Why can't God be in the middle of this
earth?

2474
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,100
Why is he in the heavens?
Sure.

2475
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:48,550
Because the fucking come from.
That's where the angels are coming from,

2476
01:58:48,551 --> 01:58:49,241
man.
Come on.

2477
01:58:49,241 --> 01:58:51,400
I got to spell it out for you.
Little tiny people that fly.

2478
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:53,560
They're fucking aliens,
man.

2479
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:55,900
They're coming down.
The grabbing the monkeys,

2480
01:58:56,110 --> 01:58:58,600
they're going to Tj's numb.
They had to take them up.

2481
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:00,430
In the end,
they're going to take him up there and

2482
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:01,770
do some experiments.
Ah,

2483
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:05,110
how confusing be so awesome.
If it was so true to be fucked by an

2484
01:59:05,111 --> 01:59:06,130
alien,
be the best,

2485
01:59:06,131 --> 01:59:08,710
probably the best.
He'd probably be really bummed out with

2486
01:59:08,711 --> 01:59:09,970
people.
You only have one dick.

2487
01:59:09,971 --> 01:59:12,170
Dude,
aliens have like 30 dicks.

2488
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:14,100
We put them everywhere in your body like
I don't even like dicks.

2489
01:59:15,150 --> 01:59:18,310
They're dicks or like ecstasy.
Tasers.

2490
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:20,380
Ah,
great.

2491
01:59:20,381 --> 01:59:22,570
Imagine their Dick was like an ecstasy
taser.

2492
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:25,390
If like the female opposite of a Taser.
Everybody has dicks.

2493
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:27,280
They open up their jacket.
Like those dudes,

2494
01:59:27,281 --> 01:59:29,930
it would sell watches and they reveal a
thousand dicks.

2495
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:31,780
Just swing out and grab a hold.
You in.

2496
01:59:32,230 --> 01:59:35,110
Ecstasy.
Tastes fresh eggs and not dick's.

2497
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:37,600
They're like a technical type thing.
That's what they say.

2498
01:59:37,601 --> 01:59:39,470
But I keep feeling that comes inside
yet,

2499
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:42,820
but they're come is ecstasy.
Don't worry.

2500
01:59:42,821 --> 01:59:43,930
Human.
This is not a date.

2501
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:47,080
I know.
It looks like a Dick and tastes like a

2502
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:48,970
dick.
Yeah,

2503
01:59:48,971 --> 01:59:51,520
that seems like a really inefficient way
to harvest gold though,

2504
01:59:51,521 --> 01:59:52,061
man.
It's like it.

2505
01:59:52,061 --> 01:59:52,841
These are,
you know,

2506
01:59:52,841 --> 01:59:56,830
the problem with those theories is like
here you've got these advance super

2507
01:59:56,831 --> 02:00:00,430
advanced beings.
They lay live on a planet that orbits,

2508
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:02,890
they figured out a way to like disperse
golden,

2509
02:00:02,891 --> 02:00:05,560
their atmosphere.
They've figured out a way to like evolve

2510
02:00:05,561 --> 02:00:08,830
monkeys into gold miners,
but it's like,

2511
02:00:08,831 --> 02:00:10,090
man,
there's gotta be a bet.

2512
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:13,870
It's gotta be a better way to do that.
A more efficient way than like flying on

2513
02:00:13,871 --> 02:00:17,470
your planet to another planet.
Fucking the monkeys turning them into

2514
02:00:17,471 --> 02:00:19,120
gold gathers.
Why?

2515
02:00:19,121 --> 02:00:22,090
Why is that the only way?
Like it seems like it's not the only

2516
02:00:22,091 --> 02:00:22,821
way,
but maybe it's,

2517
02:00:22,821 --> 02:00:24,970
it's the funnest way.
Maybe it's a good way like,

2518
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,240
but what do they give a fuck?
They're probably so far advanced from us

2519
02:00:28,241 --> 02:00:30,670
that it's a joke.
It's hilarious to go down there and do.

2520
02:00:30,671 --> 02:00:31,570
That's fun.
Yeah.

2521
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:34,600
Seaworld,
seaworld with people or it's just a kid

2522
02:00:34,601 --> 02:00:36,280
does it.
That's just like a group of kids for

2523
02:00:36,281 --> 02:00:37,360
their science.
Yeah.

2524
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:38,590
There's,
there's just no telling.

2525
02:00:38,591 --> 02:00:39,400
Right.
But well,

2526
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,230
who knows?
By the time they come back around,

2527
02:00:41,231 --> 02:00:45,730
they might be over it.
They might be so evolved after the 3,600

2528
02:00:45,731 --> 02:00:48,250
years.
If evolution is exponential,

2529
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:50,110
they might come back and not even talk
to us.

2530
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:53,430
Then people be like,
are they just decided to not come back?

2531
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,570
Just fly by and go,
president trump,

2532
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:57,280
trump.
That's going to be like,

2533
02:00:57,281 --> 02:00:59,290
they're going to sky ride it.
President trump,

2534
02:01:00,370 --> 02:01:02,040
sorry.
When I'm talking to you and they're just

2535
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:03,080
gonna fly by like,
wait,

2536
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:06,580
we can't really get to them.
Yeah,

2537
02:01:06,581 --> 02:01:08,320
because it takes too long.
Right.

2538
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:09,760
You know,
like it's like Mars,

2539
02:01:09,761 --> 02:01:11,030
like they're talking about getting to
Mars know,

2540
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,810
like a few decades.
I'll believe it when I see it.

2541
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:15,430
Right.
I believe when I see it right now,

2542
02:01:15,431 --> 02:01:17,500
you can't get to it.
So if that fucking planet comes

2543
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:21,100
searching some scorching around the
corner between Mars and Jupiter,

2544
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:21,791
we're going to go,
hey,

2545
02:01:21,791 --> 02:01:25,060
wait,
come back.

2546
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:28,030
What's the prediction of when it's going
to get here?

2547
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:29,890
Well,
they don't know if it's ever going to

2548
02:01:29,891 --> 02:01:31,780
get here.
This what they found,

2549
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,760
they don't know the orbit of it.
They don't do anything.

2550
02:01:33,761 --> 02:01:34,660
But there's,
this is,

2551
02:01:34,690 --> 02:01:37,000
this is,
it's all connected to the reason why

2552
02:01:37,001 --> 02:01:39,980
Pluto was taken off of the planet list.
They

2553
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:43,250
realized that Pluto is just a body in
what's called the Kuyper belt.

2554
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:47,150
The kuiper belt is just on the edge of
our solar system and there's a drop off

2555
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:49,580
at the end of it that they called the
galactic shelf.

2556
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:53,050
Right.
And that has been indicating to some,

2557
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:56,210
some scientists who are willing to
venture and willing to explore the idea

2558
02:01:56,420 --> 02:02:01,220
that there's a large,
massive body outside of that that's

2559
02:02:01,221 --> 02:02:04,580
causing this dropoff that's caused
causing this galactic shelf.

2560
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:07,670
So as their understanding of our solar
system gets better,

2561
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:13,310
noticeably like wider,
like as as they can look further back

2562
02:02:13,311 --> 02:02:16,550
and further distances,
telescopes keep getting better and their

2563
02:02:16,551 --> 02:02:20,990
calculations and the way they can figure
out how the spot planets in other solar

2564
02:02:20,991 --> 02:02:22,400
systems,
they're way better at it now than

2565
02:02:22,401 --> 02:02:26,330
they've ever been before.
That's when they're pretty sure they're

2566
02:02:26,331 --> 02:02:28,460
like,
we're pretty sure there's another planet

2567
02:02:28,461 --> 02:02:29,750
out there,
but it could,

2568
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:31,100
there's also some speculation.

2569
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:33,020
We,
there was a few decades ago that it

2570
02:02:33,021 --> 02:02:35,980
could be a brown dwarf star,
right?

2571
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:40,790
We could have a bio nary a solar system
that in fact many source systems are

2572
02:02:40,791 --> 02:02:43,910
binary.
Meaning there's more than one planet.

2573
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:44,900
Yeah,
there's a,

2574
02:02:44,901 --> 02:02:48,710
there's a single one and then there's a,
there's the one that we have that's on

2575
02:02:48,711 --> 02:02:51,770
right now and there's one that burned
out already and that burned out.

2576
02:02:51,771 --> 02:02:53,990
One is,
is way the fuck out there where it

2577
02:02:53,991 --> 02:02:58,991
doesn't emit any light anymore.
So this is this massive object outside

2578
02:02:59,211 --> 02:03:01,910
of Pluto.
So that was one theory that they had,

2579
02:03:01,911 --> 02:03:05,000
but I don't think they go with that one
anymore because as far as I'm,

2580
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:08,420
I know they've narrowed down the size of
this thing,

2581
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:11,510
at least with the current data to be
about four times the size of the earth.

2582
02:03:12,110 --> 02:03:15,380
So there's something four times the size
of the earth and just still tiny in

2583
02:03:15,381 --> 02:03:17,930
comparison to the son and he,
and tiny,

2584
02:03:17,931 --> 02:03:21,020
even comparison to Jupiter,
the sun is a million times bigger than

2585
02:03:21,021 --> 02:03:21,470
the earth.

2586
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:23,540
So if this thing is four times larger
than the earth,

2587
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:26,730
well I don't know what that means.
If it's a planet or if it's a,

2588
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:28,910
you know,
a giant object.

2589
02:03:28,911 --> 02:03:31,260
Like what exactly is it?
Did it used to be a son?

2590
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:33,180
Is that possible?
I don't know if that's probably,

2591
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:36,470
I don't know.
Find out how big it's supposed to be.

2592
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:40,070
Cause I'm pretty sure I'm right that
they're thinking now with their current

2593
02:03:40,071 --> 02:03:43,670
data that it might be four times as big
as the earth,

2594
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:47,900
which is still pretty fucking trippy.
That there's some rock spinning around

2595
02:03:47,901 --> 02:03:49,890
out there that's a planet bigger than
it.

2596
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:53,030
It isn't like cupid are way bigger than
cooper does on a real planet though.

2597
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:55,370
I mean it is a plas to gas chain.
Yeah.

2598
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:57,350
Like there's a center somewhere in
there.

2599
02:03:57,370 --> 02:03:58,690
Yeah.
It's like a tootsie roll pop.

2600
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:00,680
I don't know how many licks it takes to
get there though.

2601
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:03,980
It's a very big town.
It's so big.

2602
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:06,380
They have storms on Jupiter.
They're bigger than earth.

2603
02:04:06,650 --> 02:04:08,150
They've been going on for a thousand
years.

2604
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:09,140
Did you,
um,

2605
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:12,590
did you follow this thing with a
detection of the gravity waves?

2606
02:04:12,591 --> 02:04:14,180
Yes.
That's pretty crazy.

2607
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:15,980
I don't understand that.
I'm too stupid.

2608
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:17,630
Well,
I think I can explain it.

2609
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:18,890
I'm to try.
So,

2610
02:04:18,891 --> 02:04:19,970
uh,
so,

2611
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:22,010
okay.
So the idea is right,

2612
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:25,640
we know that the,
the fucking lead ball on the mattress

2613
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,790
creates these d indentations in space
and time,

2614
02:04:28,791 --> 02:04:29,360
right?
Right.

2615
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:33,050
So the idea is if that's the case in
timespace as they say,

2616
02:04:33,051 --> 02:04:35,480
so that if that's the case and you guys,
I'll probably fuck it up.

2617
02:04:35,481 --> 02:04:37,260
I'm going to track.
If that's the case,

2618
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:37,980
then what would

2619
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,390
happen if two super massive things
collided,

2620
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:45,280
right?
Like two giant black holes,

2621
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:50,110
thousands of times larger than our sun
or two stars or what?

2622
02:04:50,130 --> 02:04:52,500
What happens out there?
If these giant things collide,

2623
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:55,860
then that should create ripples because
it's so,

2624
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,840
uh,
normous that when they hit together,

2625
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:01,590
it creates these ripples in the fabric
of space time.

2626
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,720
And these are known as gravity waves,
right?

2627
02:05:03,721 --> 02:05:08,130
So to measure these ripples would be
incredibly difficult for a lot of

2628
02:05:08,131 --> 02:05:09,150
reasons.
One,

2629
02:05:09,151 --> 02:05:14,151
because I they're very fast.
The other one is because if I'm like,

2630
02:05:14,371 --> 02:05:15,840
okay,
so if I want to measure like the

2631
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:20,730
distance between two rocks and a gravity
wave flows through it,

2632
02:05:20,731 --> 02:05:23,480
then it should theoretically since it's
a oh it should couldn't,

2633
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:28,740
it should expand and like widen out the
distance between those two rocks.

2634
02:05:28,741 --> 02:05:32,910
There's going to be like a expansion is
the thing rolls through it it by micron

2635
02:05:32,911 --> 02:05:33,930
by a tiny little bit.

2636
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:36,600
It's going to either widen or linkedin
or both.

2637
02:05:36,601 --> 02:05:38,880
I think both.
So for a second.

2638
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:43,620
So how do I measure that?
If when the gravity wave passes through,

2639
02:05:43,621 --> 02:05:47,040
it's also going to make my measurement
device expand and contract and it's also

2640
02:05:47,041 --> 02:05:49,760
going to make me country expanding
contracts.

2641
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:53,880
There was no way to measure it because
everything will move with it.

2642
02:05:53,881 --> 02:05:56,880
So how do you measure it?
So they have this thing called an infor

2643
02:05:56,940 --> 02:06:00,060
in fear or Ramadan or or something.
And for amateur,

2644
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:05,070
you can look it up as this giant l shape
thing that shoots a laser that hits a

2645
02:06:05,071 --> 02:06:09,240
mirror on one side and shoots a laser
that hits a mirror on the other side

2646
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:12,120
creating this beam.
And that's the speed of light,

2647
02:06:12,121 --> 02:06:14,340
right?
It's the laser bouncing back and forth

2648
02:06:14,341 --> 02:06:18,480
at the speed of light.
So that means that it could measure a

2649
02:06:18,481 --> 02:06:22,500
shift in the gravitational wave because
nothing goes faster than the speed of

2650
02:06:22,501 --> 02:06:24,030
light,
which means that that laser,

2651
02:06:24,270 --> 02:06:29,130
you're going to be able to tell if it
follows the prediction of what would

2652
02:06:29,131 --> 02:06:31,890
happen if a gravity wave rolled through,
right?

2653
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:34,080
There's two of these things,
uh,

2654
02:06:34,081 --> 02:06:37,920
and there are hundreds of miles apart.
So if a gravity wave rolls through the

2655
02:06:37,921 --> 02:06:40,050
earth,
than both of them would theoretically

2656
02:06:40,051 --> 02:06:43,620
have these exact same minor shifts,
right?

2657
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:44,940
And so that's what happened,
man.

2658
02:06:44,941 --> 02:06:46,920
They like now when they're doing these,
uh,

2659
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:49,230
when they're doing these studies,
uh,

2660
02:06:49,231 --> 02:06:50,970
when they're testing,
they act,

2661
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,570
they will,
they send in fake gravity waves just to

2662
02:06:54,571 --> 02:06:56,580
make sure the scientists are monitoring
everything,

2663
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:58,440
writing it.
And so,

2664
02:06:58,830 --> 02:07:01,170
uh,
the guy who observed it for the first

2665
02:07:01,171 --> 02:07:03,390
time got this reading and I was like,
Holy Shit,

2666
02:07:04,580 --> 02:07:06,990
is this one of the fake,
uh,

2667
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:09,210
one of the fake waves that they send
through,

2668
02:07:09,211 --> 02:07:14,211
but that he realized that they had cut
off that part of the experiment for a

2669
02:07:15,990 --> 02:07:17,490
few weeks.
So he knew they weren't doing that.

2670
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:18,660
I'm,
I'm lost you there.

2671
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,220
So anyway,
the point is,

2672
02:07:20,221 --> 02:07:23,550
it was like the story of them like
discovering this is,

2673
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:27,960
is a amazing,
because finally this like shift

2674
02:07:27,961 --> 02:07:29,370
happened,
but the,

2675
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:31,800
the,
the long and short of it is look at what

2676
02:07:31,801 --> 02:07:33,960
it picked up.
Like show what it was picking up.

2677
02:07:33,961 --> 02:07:35,100
It picked up these two

2678
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,990
smashing into each other along far,
far away,

2679
02:07:40,991 --> 02:07:43,430
like a billion years ago.
Picked it.

2680
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:46,340
I know that it's nuts.
Look,

2681
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:48,340
look at that.
It's fucking,

2682
02:07:48,341 --> 02:07:49,960
I mean,
that's obviously not the real picture,

2683
02:07:49,961 --> 02:07:51,140
but,
um,

2684
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:54,730
I just something insane to think that,
uh,

2685
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:55,750
you know,
what's fucked up?

2686
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:59,440
That is not the real picture.
But now the real pictures that they do

2687
02:07:59,441 --> 02:08:02,650
have of what's going on in the galaxy.
You ever see a picture of a stellar

2688
02:08:02,651 --> 02:08:05,560
nursery now?
I mean I've seen the Hubble picks,

2689
02:08:05,561 --> 02:08:07,900
if that's what you're talking about.
You know what a stellar nursery.

2690
02:08:07,901 --> 02:08:09,580
I was like where stars are born.
Uh,

2691
02:08:09,581 --> 02:08:12,460
you mean like with this huge,
show me a picture.

2692
02:08:12,461 --> 02:08:15,190
I bet.
I've seen there's the structures that

2693
02:08:15,191 --> 02:08:16,750
appear.
A lot of the pictures that you see,

2694
02:08:16,751 --> 02:08:19,030
the or artist's recreation,
a lot of them,

2695
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:22,060
cause there's a lot of weird shit that
you see on the Internet.

2696
02:08:22,061 --> 02:08:23,080
You're like,
is that wait,

2697
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:25,810
can we see that for real?
Like this is planets here.

2698
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:28,810
Like this is like,
look,

2699
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:32,440
what the fuck are you looking at there?
Look at that.

2700
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:34,360
That's a stellar nursery.

2701
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:41,170
That's a nursery.
Like were stars are ejected out into the

2702
02:08:41,171 --> 02:08:44,620
universe or from this gigantic
structure.

2703
02:08:44,740 --> 02:08:46,210
That's probably,
you know,

2704
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:49,090
how fucking bigots and how hot is it
over there?

2705
02:08:49,120 --> 02:08:51,160
Can we even understand how big that is?
I mean,

2706
02:08:51,161 --> 02:08:53,350
does that even register in our stupid
little brains?

2707
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:57,430
I mean,
if you looked at a photo of the earth in

2708
02:08:57,431 --> 02:08:59,260
perspective,
what would,

2709
02:08:59,261 --> 02:09:02,150
would it even be visible on that screen?
It would be pro.

2710
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:05,530
You would probably need to blow it up a
million times.

2711
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:07,930
You see the earth,
you need a microscope.

2712
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:11,140
You'd have to look at the fuck.
Is that,

2713
02:09:11,470 --> 02:09:14,080
what is that?
Is that a demon flying through spats it,

2714
02:09:14,081 --> 02:09:16,690
it looks like,
but is that real or is that a photo?

2715
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:18,790
Is that a photo pass?
Telescope captured it.

2716
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:22,360
What the fuck man.
What is that?

2717
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:27,130
That's crazy.
Like just understand for a moment.

2718
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:31,060
Just try to wrap your head around the
idea that those are infinite sons.

2719
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:33,220
Those are all sons,
little dots,

2720
02:09:33,221 --> 02:09:36,730
little stars,
most of them way bigger than our son and

2721
02:09:36,731 --> 02:09:40,540
they're all over the fucking place and
it just goes on forever.

2722
02:09:40,541 --> 02:09:43,660
Like our brains can't do it.
We can't,

2723
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:47,950
there's no perspective.
Like email today we were talking and uh,

2724
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:50,620
and I asked you how far are you shooting
your bow?

2725
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:51,851
And you're like,
well,

2726
02:09:51,851 --> 02:09:55,450
I've done some calculations in my phone.
I see 50 yards.

2727
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:56,291
I go,
wow,

2728
02:09:56,291 --> 02:09:57,670
you shooting 50 yards?
You're like,

2729
02:09:57,671 --> 02:09:57,971
yeah,
go,

2730
02:09:57,971 --> 02:10:01,000
that's amazing.
And then we go outside and I brought you

2731
02:10:01,001 --> 02:10:02,980
to a target that was 20 yards away and
you're like,

2732
02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:04,450
aw man,
I can't shoot that far.

2733
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:05,920
Yeah,
like that.

2734
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:11,050
That was a hard moment for me,
but just we had an actual detector see

2735
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:16,000
like it's really hard to just judge
based on like taking footsteps and,

2736
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:19,030
but with those range finders,
they have these range where we have one

2737
02:10:19,031 --> 02:10:20,800
in here somewhere.
This one right here,

2738
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:27,170
this one.
This is a,

2739
02:10:27,650 --> 02:10:29,060
this is what I think that one's for
golf,

2740
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:32,960
but you,
you press a button on that sucker and it

2741
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:36,140
an x on the screen.
The other side holding it wrong.

2742
02:10:37,050 --> 02:10:38,570
Don't,
don't cover the lens.

2743
02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:42,680
You press a button on it and it'll show
you how far thing.

2744
02:10:42,681 --> 02:10:44,330
This is probably too close to using
here,

2745
02:10:44,350 --> 02:10:47,450
right?
Most of them need at least like 10 yards

2746
02:10:47,451 --> 02:10:48,650
or some,
sometimes more,

2747
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:51,350
sometimes 15 yards.
Like the binocular ones.

2748
02:10:51,351 --> 02:10:52,970
They have binocular ones that work that
way.

2749
02:10:52,971 --> 02:10:55,330
They need like 30 yards.
Anything inside of 30 yards.

2750
02:10:55,331 --> 02:10:57,740
I can't detect.
But you,

2751
02:10:57,741 --> 02:10:59,540
we,
we use that and then you get this

2752
02:10:59,541 --> 02:11:02,360
perspective and that's 20 yards to tiny
distance.

2753
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:08,540
Our sense of what infinity,
infinity and infinity,

2754
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:11,960
our sense of the infinite space that's
in,

2755
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:17,020
in the universe,
the idea of a stellar nursery being a

2756
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:19,580
hundred million light years or whatever
the fuck it is away from us.

2757
02:11:19,581 --> 02:11:21,110
We can't,
we can't,

2758
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:23,000
we can't.
We can't imagine.

2759
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:26,740
It's not available to us.
We still have the same little fucking

2760
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:29,300
monkey brain.
And I was looking at this thing the

2761
02:11:29,301 --> 02:11:31,580
other day of chimps where they showed,
uh,

2762
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:32,330
we,
we,

2763
02:11:32,330 --> 02:11:35,600
we showed her on the podcast the size of
a chimp sprain in comparison to side of

2764
02:11:35,601 --> 02:11:38,570
the size of his testicles.
It's insane.

2765
02:11:38,780 --> 02:11:40,660
They're really close.
Yeah.

2766
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:44,420
Testicles are like that big.
And his brain is like double the size of

2767
02:11:44,421 --> 02:11:45,290
his.
No Way.

2768
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:46,340
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2769
02:11:46,430 --> 02:11:47,263
Look,

2770
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:50,060
oh God.
That poor champ.

2771
02:11:51,410 --> 02:11:54,470
That's how we ended up.
You poor guy.

2772
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:59,280
How Sad.
So imagine with our,

2773
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:02,250
our balls,
which are smaller than his and our

2774
02:12:02,251 --> 02:12:03,780
brains,
which are larger than his,

2775
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:05,700
and then it's just going to keep going
in that direction.

2776
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:07,370
Okay,

2777
02:12:07,370 --> 02:12:07,920
but what,
what?

2778
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:10,020
What we're,
what we're dealing with here is this an

2779
02:12:10,021 --> 02:12:12,330
advanced version of that we need way
better.

2780
02:12:12,630 --> 02:12:14,780
We need a better meat wagon.
Yeah.

2781
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,830
In order to be able to comprehend these
numbers,

2782
02:12:16,860 --> 02:12:18,780
right.
In order to be able to figure out what

2783
02:12:18,781 --> 02:12:19,830
the,
what does infinity mean?

2784
02:12:20,020 --> 02:12:20,791
What does,
what does it mean?

2785
02:12:20,791 --> 02:12:23,340
What does a stellar nursery,
what is infinite space?

2786
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:25,080
What is time?
What is gravity?

2787
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:26,370
What is all this?
We're,

2788
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:30,330
we're like repeating shit.
Have these super fucking geniuses have

2789
02:12:30,331 --> 02:12:34,230
worked their whole life on and we're
butchering it and ruining it in a

2790
02:12:34,231 --> 02:12:36,190
podcast.
But what we're,

2791
02:12:36,210 --> 02:12:40,380
we're,
we're all doing is we're all slowly but

2792
02:12:40,381 --> 02:12:44,130
surely going to go from being that chimp
to being some new thing.

2793
02:12:44,350 --> 02:12:47,010
Just continue to do it to continue to
grow,

2794
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:50,580
continue to process and whether it's
through technology or whether it's

2795
02:12:50,581 --> 02:12:54,660
through manipulating our genetics,
we're going to become something that

2796
02:12:54,661 --> 02:12:57,500
gets this whole thing.
We're going to become some new,

2797
02:12:57,700 --> 02:12:58,520
some new things.

2798
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:00,320
Here's the crazy idea,
man.

2799
02:13:00,350 --> 02:13:03,410
You're already that thing.
Here's what this is where it gets really

2800
02:13:03,411 --> 02:13:06,320
fascinating.
It's like you're already that thing.

2801
02:13:06,590 --> 02:13:09,290
That's the game.
The game is you're already that thing

2802
02:13:09,291 --> 02:13:13,040
pretending you're not the thing.
Doing some form of recreation that

2803
02:13:13,041 --> 02:13:16,160
involves being astounded by the
infinite,

2804
02:13:16,161 --> 02:13:20,330
enormous size of the universe because of
your particular tiny,

2805
02:13:20,331 --> 02:13:21,950
tiny,
tiny little body.

2806
02:13:22,130 --> 02:13:23,390
And so the gate,
that's,

2807
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:28,220
that's the game that we're involved in.
You are ready are everything

2808
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:33,460
experiencing this very temporary oh
illusion of being somehow not a part of

2809
02:13:35,191 --> 02:13:36,570
everything.
You already are,

2810
02:13:36,571 --> 02:13:38,730
the everything,
your Adams,

2811
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:40,470
your,
um,

2812
02:13:41,030 --> 02:13:42,600
your,
your atomic makeup,

2813
02:13:42,601 --> 02:13:45,720
those atoms inside of you there
essentially infinite.

2814
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:46,250
I,
they,

2815
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:48,390
they will go on forever.
We've talked about this before,

2816
02:13:48,690 --> 02:13:52,470
but that's what you are.
You are infinity experiencing itself,

2817
02:13:52,710 --> 02:13:55,590
pretending that you don't know anything
at all.

2818
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:59,010
And so this head in the sand and we were
talking about getting caught in,

2819
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:01,440
caught up with your bills,
your relationship,

2820
02:14:01,590 --> 02:14:04,140
your hair or my boobs.

2821
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:07,410
Symmetrical.
Am I a good person?

2822
02:14:07,590 --> 02:14:10,500
All of this stuff is very temporary,
fleeting,

2823
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:14,580
uh,
experience that infinity is having as

2824
02:14:14,581 --> 02:14:17,880
you.
And so you are the thing like no matter

2825
02:14:17,881 --> 02:14:22,881
what technological enhancements that
happen that maybe makes you live longer,

2826
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:25,710
maybe allows you to download your
consciousness,

2827
02:14:25,711 --> 02:14:30,660
a new computer experience a million
orgasms at once and wow,

2828
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:33,060
any of these things,
you're still,

2829
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:35,620
um,
you still are the,

2830
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:39,780
you still are the infinite.
These are just distortions in the field

2831
02:14:39,781 --> 02:14:41,790
of experience.
The idea is,

2832
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:47,120
and I think it's a very beautiful idea,
you don't need the God damn singularity

2833
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:52,290
to experience this.
You don't need the singularity to

2834
02:14:52,291 --> 02:14:54,990
experience being something greater than
you.

2835
02:14:54,991 --> 02:14:59,490
You don't need to become a trans human.
You don't need to become an h plus.

2836
02:14:59,491 --> 02:15:02,670
You don't need to get a chip,
a neural implant in your brain.

2837
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:06,570
You can,
if you just spend enough time sitting,

2838
02:15:06,571 --> 02:15:11,571
still experience what it's like to have
your identity dissolve for a second.

2839
02:15:13,090 --> 02:15:17,070
Not that easy little just sit still and
it's not just sitting still,

2840
02:15:17,071 --> 02:15:20,130
it's sitting still with a method sitting
still with an understanding of what

2841
02:15:20,131 --> 02:15:22,470
you're trying to achieve.
It's still sitting still with tools that

2842
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:25,680
allow you to manage your consciousness
during this process.

2843
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:26,340
Well,
you know,

2844
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:29,070
you got to get better at it.
I think that if it,

2845
02:15:29,190 --> 02:15:30,690
well,
you only think it's a,

2846
02:15:30,691 --> 02:15:31,560
it's a,
it's a,

2847
02:15:31,710 --> 02:15:33,930
I think it's a discipline.
It's a discipline,

2848
02:15:33,931 --> 02:15:35,460
but the idea of like,
so I mean,

2849
02:15:35,461 --> 02:15:36,690
there's so many different versions of
it.

2850
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:38,100
So like,
you know,

2851
02:15:38,101 --> 02:15:40,350
some versions have very specific,
you know,

2852
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:44,000
breathing patterns or ways that you're
going to like the,

2853
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:46,740
the whatever your meditative technique
is it.

2854
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:48,660
But then some of them just say,
look,

2855
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:54,020
don't worry about all that bullshit.
Just find a place anywhere and sit down

2856
02:15:54,061 --> 02:15:55,410
for a second.
You know,

2857
02:15:55,411 --> 02:15:56,880
like,
I remember once I was asking my

2858
02:15:56,881 --> 02:15:57,990
girlfriend,
she was sitting,

2859
02:15:57,991 --> 02:16:01,110
we have this like a Pooja table at our
house is what it's called.

2860
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:03,810
Highly recommend.
It sounds cheesy,

2861
02:16:03,811 --> 02:16:06,210
but it's fantastic.
Create a little space.

2862
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:09,360
Put in that space.
People that you love,

2863
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:12,600
people that inspire you,
people who are awesome doesn't have to

2864
02:16:12,601 --> 02:16:14,070
be Jesus,
the Virgin Mary.

2865
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:18,390
It could be anybody you're inspired by
creative space with these pictures.

2866
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:22,650
And then maybe throw a picture on there
as somebody that you fucking hate and

2867
02:16:22,651 --> 02:16:25,710
you sit in front of this uh,
thing and you just like,

2868
02:16:25,711 --> 02:16:29,860
look at these people that you love and
then maybe you at the person that you

2869
02:16:29,861 --> 02:16:34,810
don't like so much and you try to
transfer that love to that person to

2870
02:16:34,811 --> 02:16:37,660
clear out the Guy Dan winning.
Whenever you hate anybody,

2871
02:16:37,661 --> 02:16:40,750
your operating systems got a bit of a
disturbance in it.

2872
02:16:40,751 --> 02:16:43,150
So you want to like fix that connection
if you can.

2873
02:16:43,151 --> 02:16:45,220
But anyway,
she's just sitting in front of this,

2874
02:16:45,221 --> 02:16:45,941
uh,
Pooja table.

2875
02:16:45,941 --> 02:16:46,900
We haven't,
I asked her,

2876
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:48,250
are you meditating?

2877
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:50,380
I shouldn't have done that.
It's rude if someone's meditating.

2878
02:16:50,381 --> 02:16:51,340
But I'm like,
are you meditating?

2879
02:16:51,341 --> 02:16:53,200
She's like,
now I'm just sitting here.

2880
02:16:53,590 --> 02:16:55,510
I thought that was so funny because it's
like,

2881
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:56,500
oh right,
you're not,

2882
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:58,600
you're not officially meditating,
you're just sitting.

2883
02:16:58,810 --> 02:17:01,630
But if you look at what zen means or
what someone told me,

2884
02:17:01,810 --> 02:17:05,140
[inaudible] means the zen meditation,
it means just sit.

2885
02:17:05,590 --> 02:17:09,190
There's no big anything to it.
There's not some fabulous,

2886
02:17:09,191 --> 02:17:11,230
incredible,
insane thing you're doing.

2887
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:15,880
Just ask yourself,
when was the last time I sat and didn't

2888
02:17:15,881 --> 02:17:18,880
move for five minutes?
When was that?

2889
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:20,253
When was it?

2890
02:17:20,810 --> 02:17:21,641
I think you're,
you're,

2891
02:17:21,641 --> 02:17:26,300
you're looking for all the same things
in so many different things that we do.

2892
02:17:26,420 --> 02:17:30,770
I think we're all looking for this
moment where everything sort of syncs up

2893
02:17:30,771 --> 02:17:34,040
and make sense and feels harmonious,
you know,

2894
02:17:34,041 --> 02:17:35,990
and I think,
I hate to bring it back to archery

2895
02:17:35,991 --> 02:17:37,910
again,
but I think that's what you're really

2896
02:17:37,911 --> 02:17:40,820
enjoying about those moments when you
release that Arrow.

2897
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:44,780
Like I'm seeing,
I watched you a shoot some arrows today

2898
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:48,140
and I'm seeing like this pleasure in
you.

2899
02:17:48,141 --> 02:17:51,170
Like when you're,
you're in the proper stance and you're

2900
02:17:51,171 --> 02:17:55,100
releasing the Arrow and you're watching
the path and everything looks good and

2901
02:17:55,101 --> 02:18:00,050
you're releasing it and there's this,
when you have mastered that moment,

2902
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:02,360
even for a second or two,
you see this?

2903
02:18:03,170 --> 02:18:05,470
Yeah.
See this burst of off the bat,

2904
02:18:05,990 --> 02:18:09,110
you're not there anymore and your
existing through the shots,

2905
02:18:09,111 --> 02:18:11,120
it man,
your existing through your jokes,

2906
02:18:11,330 --> 02:18:15,170
you're existing through a rant on a
podcast you're existing through making

2907
02:18:15,171 --> 02:18:18,860
your girlfriend come your existing
through waving to a friend,

2908
02:18:18,861 --> 02:18:21,670
your existing through the experience
that you give other people when they're

2909
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:22,610
around you.
Yeah.

2910
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:24,890
Your existing through those things.
Yeah.

2911
02:18:25,140 --> 02:18:25,821
You know,
and those,

2912
02:18:25,821 --> 02:18:28,610
when you nail it in all forms,
it's all,

2913
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:30,500
they're all similar and related.

2914
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:31,621
That's right,
man.

2915
02:18:31,621 --> 02:18:33,600
They're all,
they all have at their core the same

2916
02:18:33,601 --> 02:18:34,434
thing.
It's,

2917
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,530
it's,
you're at,

2918
02:18:35,550 --> 02:18:39,430
you're touching the core of what you
really are and,

2919
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:41,530
and you know,
that's why meditation is,

2920
02:18:41,550 --> 02:18:44,600
I think is so incredibly misunderstood.
Uh,

2921
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:46,770
and something that really isn't,
isn't,

2922
02:18:47,670 --> 02:18:50,610
isn't that different from any other
thing that you're doing.

2923
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:50,960
Boat

2924
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:52,370
float tanks,
right.

2925
02:18:52,371 --> 02:18:53,390
Float tanks is,
it is,

2926
02:18:53,391 --> 02:18:56,000
that's the real meditation.
That's meditation advanced.

2927
02:18:56,600 --> 02:18:59,930
If you want a vacation from life in an
ability to step back and really look at

2928
02:18:59,931 --> 02:19:00,860
yourself,
yeah.

2929
02:19:00,861 --> 02:19:03,380
You could sit in the corner and you
could just do it that way and there's

2930
02:19:03,381 --> 02:19:06,380
nothing wrong with doing it that way.
There's nothing wrong with going out on

2931
02:19:06,381 --> 02:19:10,160
a hill and sitting in and just
overlooking a beautiful field and taking

2932
02:19:10,161 --> 02:19:13,570
in nature and in meditating in that way.
That's a meditation in another.

2933
02:19:13,580 --> 02:19:16,220
Sure.
It's almost like an energy absorption.

2934
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:18,920
Like you taking some power off the
battery,

2935
02:19:18,921 --> 02:19:21,110
like you're feeding it,
you're feeding off of it,

2936
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:23,870
but the float tank is where it's at,
man,

2937
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:26,570
and that those fucking things are
exploding now.

2938
02:19:26,571 --> 02:19:28,190
People are it now

2939
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:31,370
for the first time in decades,
how important those things are.

2940
02:19:31,580 --> 02:19:34,280
There was this big,
a story that I printed the other day

2941
02:19:34,281 --> 02:19:35,600
about the basketball team,
the,

2942
02:19:35,601 --> 02:19:37,970
the um,
was the golden state warriors.

2943
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:39,980
They use it every week.
Make sense?

2944
02:19:40,530 --> 02:19:42,170
Dude,
the fucking biggest one in the world

2945
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:44,720
just opened up in Pasadena,
just float,

2946
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:47,570
float lab.
Just open up one in Westwood.

2947
02:19:47,571 --> 02:19:49,400
They opened up a big location in
Westwood.

2948
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:50,930
They're exploding now.
They're everywhere.

2949
02:19:50,931 --> 02:19:54,260
They're all over the world.
People love it for finally getting it.

2950
02:19:54,261 --> 02:19:59,000
People are finally getting it.
This thing is like the best way to have

2951
02:19:59,001 --> 02:20:02,810
a vacation from your thoughts or to be
alone with them rather have vacation

2952
02:20:02,811 --> 02:20:04,820
from your body I should say.
It's great cause you're,

2953
02:20:04,821 --> 02:20:07,360
you're peeling away all the goddamn
stimulus.

2954
02:20:07,361 --> 02:20:09,200
I mean bullshit.
I guess if there is like with

2955
02:20:09,201 --> 02:20:12,440
meditation,
if there was some kind of like well they

2956
02:20:12,441 --> 02:20:15,590
do call it a practice but the reason
they call it a practice it's because a

2957
02:20:15,591 --> 02:20:20,300
lot of meditation is like you're sitting
there and the dog will start barking.

2958
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:21,430
Right.
Um,

2959
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:22,520
got to kick it.
Right.

2960
02:20:22,521 --> 02:20:24,740
Well you got to throw it into the wall.
My die.

2961
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:29,300
You have to see.
But you sort of like this is,

2962
02:20:29,330 --> 02:20:30,290
this is the,
I'm just kidding.

2963
02:20:30,291 --> 02:20:33,020
Of course guys,
when you're meditating you get up and

2964
02:20:33,021 --> 02:20:36,290
throw your dog.
But this is like a so,

2965
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:41,090
so like a rom dass talks about like
giving this meditation class and people

2966
02:20:41,091 --> 02:20:44,090
are meditating and there was like a
siren that kept going off and people are

2967
02:20:44,091 --> 02:20:46,220
getting annoyed.
It was like buy a firehouse I guess.

2968
02:20:46,790 --> 02:20:49,370
So the fire truck would leave or the
fire truck would come in.

2969
02:20:49,371 --> 02:20:50,780
People are getting annoyed.
He can't meditate.

2970
02:20:50,781 --> 02:20:52,220
There's always a siren.
And he's like,

2971
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:55,730
that's just energy.
Like you were hearing.

2972
02:20:56,270 --> 02:21:01,250
This is just energy going into your body
and your body is turning into the sound

2973
02:21:01,251 --> 02:21:04,100
of a siren.
But this is just grist for the mill is

2974
02:21:04,101 --> 02:21:04,640
what he called it.

2975
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:09,170
This is just another form that the
universe takes the sound of a siren.

2976
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:12,620
And so when you're meditating,
you start watching yourself,

2977
02:21:12,621 --> 02:21:14,630
right?
So and uh,

2978
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:17,540
so the dog barked.
Like if I'm sitting meditating,

2979
02:21:17,660 --> 02:21:21,680
the dog would bark and I will watch
myself.

2980
02:21:21,681 --> 02:21:25,880
So now I watched the way that my body
reacts and the Dog Barks and the

2981
02:21:25,881 --> 02:21:29,510
physical,
kind of like a very slight tensing up to

2982
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:33,260
inside a feeling fucking frustration who
struggled.

2983
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:34,940
Shut the fuck up and net.
But I'm,

2984
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,600
but now I'm watching that so well this
is what I do and I'm annoyed by

2985
02:21:38,601 --> 02:21:40,370
something.
And now you can watch the way that

2986
02:21:40,371 --> 02:21:45,371
annoying feeling emerges and dissipates.
And that's like the meditative process.

2987
02:21:45,501 --> 02:21:50,450
Whereas a float tank,
you're stripping that extra thing away.

2988
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:54,350
So now it's just the sense of being
there,

2989
02:21:54,530 --> 02:21:56,720
minus having to deal with it
disturbances so much.

2990
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,600
Even though they are in a float tank,
you'll still get some disturbances.

2991
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:00,433
You know,
your,

2992
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:03,800
you'll notice the way the air that
you're breathing or you'll feel some

2993
02:22:03,801 --> 02:22:08,000
burn where there's like a cut on your,
maybe a drop of water will land and hit

2994
02:22:08,001 --> 02:22:11,900
you in the head or something like that.
But we've got a squeegee the roof before

2995
02:22:11,901 --> 02:22:13,280
you go in.
That's a big part of it.

2996
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:14,661
You know,
the,

2997
02:22:14,661 --> 02:22:16,520
um,
this guys who have invented some

2998
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:19,190
workarounds for that,
there's a guy that owns a place in

2999
02:22:19,191 --> 02:22:21,860
Austin,
a zero gravity in Austin.

3000
02:22:21,861 --> 02:22:23,810
He's figured out a way to,
um,

3001
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:25,210
he's got a different,
his,

3002
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:25,980
his are made out of

3003
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,970
like ship holes.
Yeah.

3004
02:22:26,971 --> 02:22:28,410
They don't trip,
don't trip.

3005
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:33,000
And he's also got some sort of a,
a way to ventilate the a,

3006
02:22:33,001 --> 02:22:36,530
so there's no condensation on the,
on the roof of his tanks here and

3007
02:22:36,531 --> 02:22:38,280
credible.
That's Kevin Johnson.

3008
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:40,770
Great Guy.
Cool Texas.

3009
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:42,150
If you're there,
it's a great spot.

3010
02:22:42,450 --> 02:22:43,283
But,
um,

3011
02:22:43,460 --> 02:22:44,340
um,
but mine,

3012
02:22:44,341 --> 02:22:47,280
I just give it a once over with the
squeegee when I climb in.

3013
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:50,670
But those one of those things about like
the itches and the all the bullshit

3014
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:53,070
other than the dripping of the water,
it's all in your head.

3015
02:22:53,130 --> 02:22:56,130
You just need to spend enough time in
those things.

3016
02:22:56,131 --> 02:22:58,290
Like I don't experience that anymore
when I get in the,

3017
02:22:58,291 --> 02:23:02,670
even if I have like a scratch,
like Jujitsu scratches were a problem

3018
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:05,880
because like a lot of times dudes don't
trim the nails and you get really

3019
02:23:05,881 --> 02:23:09,600
scratched up.
But the good thing is the fucking salt

3020
02:23:09,601 --> 02:23:12,830
bath kills Era Thang Aero Thang.

3021
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:15,360
I mean all the nasty funky shit on your
skin.

3022
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:18,390
That's salt torches.
It cause you're talking about thousand

3023
02:23:18,391 --> 02:23:21,210
pounds of Epson Salts.
Super healthy for your body.

3024
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:24,810
So you just gotta suffer through a few
seconds of stinging if you've got to

3025
02:23:24,811 --> 02:23:27,810
scratch but just breathe.
All you have to do is concentrate on

3026
02:23:27,811 --> 02:23:30,150
your breath.
The key to the tank is breathing in and

3027
02:23:30,151 --> 02:23:31,530
breathing out.
Just nothing.

3028
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:35,150
But that put all of your energy on in
with the good and out with the bad.

3029
02:23:35,650 --> 02:23:39,300
With the good and out with the bath and
then I stopped assigning it a purpose.

3030
02:23:39,301 --> 02:23:40,580
I started assigning and get a,
uh,

3031
02:23:40,610 --> 02:23:43,560
like a quality or a positive or a
negative.

3032
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:47,250
I just breathe and breathe in and I
don't allow myself every now and then,

3033
02:23:47,251 --> 02:23:49,290
my mind wants to start going about,
man,

3034
02:23:49,291 --> 02:23:50,880
you've got to work on that new bit.
That's new bins.

3035
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:53,070
Fucking got a wheel hitch in it.
You've got to abandon this.

3036
02:23:53,071 --> 02:23:54,720
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

3037
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:56,160
You're like,
ah man.

3038
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:57,600
When are you going to fucking clean your
office?

3039
02:23:57,601 --> 02:24:00,720
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up and what I'm doing.

3040
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:05,840
And then you can bypass the land of
trouble and confusion.

3041
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:09,840
There's like a land of trouble and
confusion that takes about 20 minutes to

3042
02:24:09,841 --> 02:24:13,170
get through and you to,
she's fucking hustle through that land

3043
02:24:13,171 --> 02:24:15,240
and you've got to do the work.
You got to fucking concentrate on the

3044
02:24:15,241 --> 02:24:18,390
breathing because if you give in to the
land of trouble and confusion,

3045
02:24:18,391 --> 02:24:20,820
but let me just hang out here and talk
to you guys for awhile.

3046
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:24,010
They'll fucking drag you into their
come.

3047
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:26,700
Let's talk about your girlfriend from
high school.

3048
02:24:26,701 --> 02:24:28,470
Maybe if you guys got back together and
you'd be happy,

3049
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:31,740
maybe Janine,
amazing story.

3050
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:32,870
She's got kids,
you've got cage,

3051
02:24:32,871 --> 02:24:34,160
you both pick up,
you know,

3052
02:24:34,490 --> 02:24:35,660
like,
you know what I mean?

3053
02:24:35,670 --> 02:24:37,710
I'm pretty sure is a con.
Okay.

3054
02:24:37,711 --> 02:24:39,360
You always a con,
you gotta tell the fucking business

3055
02:24:39,361 --> 02:24:44,361
manager and you start having these like
wars in your head about your life that

3056
02:24:44,701 --> 02:24:48,060
are totally unnecessary and
counterintuitive to what you're trying

3057
02:24:48,061 --> 02:24:49,920
to do there.
We try and do there as escape,

3058
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:54,980
escape the whole thing by concentrate.
That's why yoga is the shit because yoga

3059
02:24:54,991 --> 02:24:57,780
is hard to do.
Just like archery is hard to do when

3060
02:24:57,781 --> 02:25:00,770
you're standing there and you've got the
fucking one foot up and you're

3061
02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:02,900
stretching up like this and you're
holding it,

3062
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:04,980
your whole body shaking and they're
like,

3063
02:25:04,981 --> 02:25:06,480
hold,
hold

3064
02:25:08,130 --> 02:25:10,200
and not thinking about anything other
than,

3065
02:25:10,201 --> 02:25:12,420
you know,
breathing and trying to do that because

3066
02:25:12,421 --> 02:25:16,920
he can't do it when you're,
when it's a swipe at that beak from

3067
02:25:16,921 --> 02:25:18,180
guy's a scumbag,
but he's,

3068
02:25:18,181 --> 02:25:19,440
he had a fucking great idea.

3069
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:20,820
All right,
get a great idea.

3070
02:25:20,821 --> 02:25:23,830
Then 104 temperature to that tests your
will.

3071
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:26,110
It does something to your brain.
Um,

3072
02:25:26,111 --> 02:25:29,350
Doctor Rhonda Patrick thinks it might
create something called heat shock

3073
02:25:29,351 --> 02:25:31,920
proteins that you get from a sauna.
Citizens,

3074
02:25:31,921 --> 02:25:34,990
there's a positive benefit health wise
to being in a sauna,

3075
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:36,100
right?
Very positive.

3076
02:25:36,101 --> 02:25:39,720
To a point where she was saying that
there was a 40% reduction in mortalities

3077
02:25:39,730 --> 02:25:42,910
across the board from people that are
regular saw users,

3078
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:45,270
40% reduction in cancers,
heart attacks,

3079
02:25:45,271 --> 02:25:46,240
stroke,
all those things,

3080
02:25:46,420 --> 02:25:49,120
massive mortality dropoff because the
sauna,

3081
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:51,730
because your body produces these heat
shock proteins,

3082
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:53,710
she's like,
it could very well be going on in those

3083
02:25:53,711 --> 02:25:55,780
classes.
You're so fucking hot right here.

3084
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:57,970
Your body's overheating.
It's freaking the fuck out.

3085
02:25:58,090 --> 02:26:01,720
So 140 degrees in there and you're doing
unbelievably strenuous exercise.

3086
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:06,760
I think there's all these different
methods that we have come up with,

3087
02:26:06,761 --> 02:26:09,460
whether it's martial arts,
whether it's yoga,

3088
02:26:09,610 --> 02:26:11,890
whether it's meditation,
whether it's the tank,

3089
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:17,010
they're all trying to get away from the
influence of the fucking primate DNA,

3090
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:19,570
right?

3091
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:21,160
All of it.
The jealousy,

3092
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:24,790
the tha,
tha tha tha tha wanton materialism.

3093
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:29,710
The fucking anger and traffic and the
nonsense about your career and the

3094
02:26:29,890 --> 02:26:34,060
interpersonal relationship bullshit that
we put ourselves through back and forth.

3095
02:26:34,470 --> 02:26:39,470
A big part of it all is a perspective
that was inherited.

3096
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:42,220
We inherited it from these fucking
barbarians,

3097
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:45,310
right?
That came in each other and just barely

3098
02:26:45,311 --> 02:26:46,720
made it.
They fucking,

3099
02:26:46,721 --> 02:26:50,040
they did live to be 10 and they did fuck
somebody else and meet people.

3100
02:26:50,041 --> 02:26:52,360
We're probably getting pregnant when
they were six years old back then,

3101
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:53,860
but who knows what the fuck.
We were like,

3102
02:26:53,861 --> 02:26:55,040
we're a month.
You know,

3103
02:26:55,210 --> 02:26:58,660
we had to become what we are today,
but we're trapped.

3104
02:26:58,930 --> 02:27:02,170
We're trapped with the momentum of that
shit in our bodies.

3105
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,480
Trapped,
not trapped.

3106
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:07,870
You can escape,
but hindered to the point where it

3107
02:27:07,871 --> 02:27:09,880
requires,
it requires input.

3108
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:12,880
Well,
this is the w attached.

3109
02:27:12,910 --> 02:27:15,790
This is why I like the word attached.
You're attached to it.

3110
02:27:16,030 --> 02:27:18,160
You're cleaning to it.
You're holding onto it.

3111
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:23,460
You're carrying around this like just a
fucking stinking corpse that you think

3112
02:27:24,191 --> 02:27:26,440
is who you are and you're clinging to
it.

3113
02:27:26,441 --> 02:27:29,290
That's the land that you're talking
about that you're going through and

3114
02:27:29,291 --> 02:27:32,590
people don't wanna let go of that
because that is what defines you.

3115
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:35,980
That's everything that you are and
people want to be to find.

3116
02:27:36,010 --> 02:27:39,730
They would rather be defined then they
would be by being undefined.

3117
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:41,020
Yeah,
but when you've,

3118
02:27:41,021 --> 02:27:42,700
okay,
so you've sailed through,

3119
02:27:42,910 --> 02:27:44,860
what did you call the land of trouble
and despair?

3120
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:46,450
Yeah.
So you've sailed through the land of

3121
02:27:46,451 --> 02:27:48,460
trouble in his space.
That's 20 minutes.

3122
02:27:48,610 --> 02:27:52,390
So what's after that?
How would you describe the state after

3123
02:27:52,391 --> 02:27:53,010
that?

3124
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:55,260
The state after that is where it gets
psychedelic.

3125
02:27:55,610 --> 02:27:59,880
The state after that is where you,
you don't exist anymore and you're just,

3126
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:04,020
you're intertwining yourself with
information and ideas and these ideas

3127
02:28:04,021 --> 02:28:06,240
are bouncing around your head,
but you don't really consider yourself

3128
02:28:06,241 --> 02:28:07,770
as you is.
If you do,

3129
02:28:07,771 --> 02:28:09,840
you'll snap out of it.
One of the weirder things about the

3130
02:28:09,841 --> 02:28:13,800
psychedelic trance that you get from the
tank is that it's so pliable and go in

3131
02:28:13,801 --> 02:28:16,320
it and out of it and sometimes I lose it
and I'm done.

3132
02:28:16,350 --> 02:28:19,740
I'm just laying there for the next hour,
for the next hour it's gone.

3133
02:28:20,190 --> 02:28:21,030
I'll brie.
They'll do,

3134
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:23,170
but it was whatever it was was such a
whipple,

3135
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:28,420
such a right,
so strange and odd and bizarre and non

3136
02:28:28,820 --> 02:28:31,180
non non dimensional.
It doesn't,

3137
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:34,460
doesn't pertain to anything that you
experienced in this dimension.

3138
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:38,570
So you become something when your body
is free of your mind,

3139
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:41,540
when your mind is free of your past,
when you just,

3140
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,530
you escape.

3141
02:28:42,770 --> 02:28:45,740
It's almost like you're pulling your,
it's like almost like a gravitational

3142
02:28:45,741 --> 02:28:49,520
pull or an atmosphere rather.
Well you pop out of that atmosphere like

3143
02:28:49,521 --> 02:28:52,910
a rocket that shoots up into space and
you float around for a little while.

3144
02:28:52,920 --> 02:28:54,890
Then you come back down and deal with
the bullshit again.

3145
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:58,190
But you're,
when you pop out of the land of trouble

3146
02:28:58,191 --> 02:29:00,680
and despair,
it's like you're floating in zero

3147
02:29:00,681 --> 02:29:04,100
gravity because you're in the tank.
You literally feel like you're in zero

3148
02:29:04,101 --> 02:29:06,860
gravity because you don't feel anything
anymore because once you've relaxed to

3149
02:29:06,861 --> 02:29:09,920
the point where the water is no longer
distinguishable,

3150
02:29:10,250 --> 02:29:12,350
the air and the water,
the same thing and you just feel like

3151
02:29:12,351 --> 02:29:14,360
you're floating.
That's where it's at,

3152
02:29:14,361 --> 02:29:16,060
man.
You've got to get to that space when you

3153
02:29:16,061 --> 02:29:19,570
bought is just totally stopped moving
and when you get to that space in your

3154
02:29:19,571 --> 02:29:24,410
body is totally stopped moving and
you've gone through the land of trouble

3155
02:29:24,411 --> 02:29:26,990
and despair.
You just get to the place of just

3156
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:30,890
thought.
You get to the place of thought.

3157
02:29:30,891 --> 02:29:35,891
That's free of all the culture and
tradition and even language to a certain

3158
02:29:36,171 --> 02:29:39,080
extent.
The thoughts stop being like you're

3159
02:29:39,081 --> 02:29:43,100
relaying things in your head in
sentences and paragraphs.

3160
02:29:43,101 --> 02:29:45,590
It,
it becomes concepts and ideas that are

3161
02:29:45,591 --> 02:29:48,890
almost alien to language gets very
weird.

3162
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:50,750
Yeah.
Especially when you're on edibles.

3163
02:29:51,100 --> 02:29:52,610
Ah,
I can only imagine.

3164
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,400
Why don't you do it more often?
Why don't you do it more often?

3165
02:29:55,430 --> 02:29:57,650
Because my tank,
my zen tank,

3166
02:29:57,710 --> 02:30:01,280
we moved and I put it in the garage and
I just haven't set it up.

3167
02:30:01,790 --> 02:30:03,410
That's all.
I got to clean the garage out.

3168
02:30:03,411 --> 02:30:05,210
I gotta order more salt.
It's all my fault.

3169
02:30:05,211 --> 02:30:07,520
I loved that thing.
It was so nice.

3170
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:09,920
I was so nice going in there after a
workout,

3171
02:30:09,921 --> 02:30:13,490
just going in and just went on.
Understand that you don't have it fading

3172
02:30:13,491 --> 02:30:15,740
and I got to get it set up again.
I just have to set it up.

3173
02:30:15,770 --> 02:30:17,570
I've got to call someone.
Do you have to do it yourself?

3174
02:30:17,630 --> 02:30:18,411
No,
I think,

3175
02:30:18,411 --> 02:30:20,130
uh,
I can to call those zen people.

3176
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:21,320
Go Yo Hook.
No,

3177
02:30:21,321 --> 02:30:23,150
he's,
I think he's going to be in town to do

3178
02:30:23,151 --> 02:30:25,100
another podcast.
I'm gonna get you to help me set it up

3179
02:30:25,101 --> 02:30:25,934
again.

3180
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,950
But it's not that I,
it's that is part of it.

3181
02:30:27,951 --> 02:30:31,700
But the other part of it is I've got a
fucking shit ton of quarter.

3182
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:34,010
Like I have a hoarder problem in my
garage.

3183
02:30:34,011 --> 02:30:35,810
And do you think your office is bad?
Man?

3184
02:30:36,230 --> 02:30:39,140
My garage looks there could be a dead
animal in that.

3185
02:30:39,150 --> 02:30:42,200
Like I've got so much shit piled up.
I got to clean it out.

3186
02:30:42,370 --> 02:30:44,270
And if I just did that,
I would have a float tank.

3187
02:30:44,271 --> 02:30:48,710
But also the other cool thing is I live
right down the street from just float.

3188
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:51,920
Oh yeah,
I can go down there and Jim has been

3189
02:30:51,921 --> 02:30:53,840
really cool and letting me like float
there.

3190
02:30:53,841 --> 02:30:55,480
So it's awesome.
That's great.

3191
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:56,810
Yeah.
Oh that's nice.

3192
02:30:56,830 --> 02:30:59,780
It's so luxurious.
Those voices are booming now.

3193
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:01,910
They're booming solo.
It's so cool.

3194
02:31:01,911 --> 02:31:03,080
Yeah.
And they should be man,

3195
02:31:03,081 --> 02:31:03,950
because,
but this,

3196
02:31:03,951 --> 02:31:06,680
this place you're talking about man,
uh,

3197
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:10,910
the place that you're accessing through
the float tank and not always,

3198
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,830
by the way,
sometimes I just go float.

3199
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:15,980
Well,
the idea is you're always there.

3200
02:31:16,010 --> 02:31:18,920
You're there right now.
Like that place you're talking about,

3201
02:31:18,921 --> 02:31:21,870
you're there right now.
It's just that your attention has been

3202
02:31:21,871 --> 02:31:25,650
consumed by all the phenomena that are
swirling around you at this moment

3203
02:31:25,651 --> 02:31:30,651
called your podcast.
So you're there right now and that the,

3204
02:31:30,820 --> 02:31:34,830
the practice of mindfulness and whatever
way you can practice mindfulness in a

3205
02:31:34,831 --> 02:31:38,670
float tank,
Zendo in your car,

3206
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:42,150
wherever you want,
the practice of mindfulness is helping

3207
02:31:42,151 --> 02:31:46,200
you at least maybe not shoot out of the
gravity of the planet,

3208
02:31:46,201 --> 02:31:49,560
of your personality,
but at least like get into the air a

3209
02:31:49,561 --> 02:31:52,530
little bit instead of getting cause this
land of what does it,

3210
02:31:52,531 --> 02:31:54,540
sorry.
Trouble in the land of trouble and

3211
02:31:54,541 --> 02:31:57,360
despair.
This is like the discursive mind,

3212
02:31:57,361 --> 02:31:58,740
right?
So this is like a,

3213
02:31:59,250 --> 02:32:00,460
you know,
the,

3214
02:32:00,461 --> 02:32:04,230
the idea that uh,
there are two arrows strikes,

3215
02:32:04,231 --> 02:32:04,470
right?

3216
02:32:04,470 --> 02:32:06,690
So in,
in every single given moment,

3217
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:08,490
there are all these phenomena that are
happening.

3218
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:11,880
Some of the phenomena,
you don't notice some of the phenomena

3219
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:13,980
you do,
but there's two Arrow strikes.

3220
02:32:13,981 --> 02:32:16,170
One of them is the initial one that
bothers you.

3221
02:32:16,171 --> 02:32:18,540
Like somebody cuts you off in traffic,
right?

3222
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:22,290
So someone cuts you off in traffic.
It's a classic example and you go,

3223
02:32:22,291 --> 02:32:24,900
what the fuck?
What the fuck?

3224
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:27,300
Jesus fucking Christ.
So it was wrecked,

3225
02:32:27,301 --> 02:32:30,390
right?
Arrow strike the first air strike is the

3226
02:32:30,391 --> 02:32:34,260
guy cutting you off in traffic.
The second Arrow strike and the poison

3227
02:32:34,261 --> 02:32:37,920
arrow is everything that follows.
Now you're in the land of trouble and

3228
02:32:37,921 --> 02:32:39,870
it's fair.
Now your mind has become this echo

3229
02:32:39,871 --> 02:32:42,600
chamber bouncing around with all these
thoughts of like,

3230
02:32:42,601 --> 02:32:44,340
God damn it,
people are fucking assholes.

3231
02:32:44,341 --> 02:32:47,580
No one cares about no though.
Everyone's so fucking selfish.

3232
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:50,150
God,
that fucking asshole at work earlier

3233
02:32:50,150 --> 02:32:50,150
today.

3234
02:32:50,150 --> 02:32:51,140
Suck man.
Yeah,

3235
02:32:51,150 --> 02:32:52,800
that's just salt.
And so now,

3236
02:32:52,830 --> 02:32:54,900
and that's called,
that's called getting lost,

3237
02:32:54,901 --> 02:32:56,160
right?
That's called getting lost.

3238
02:32:56,161 --> 02:32:58,980
So flow tanks,
meditation.

3239
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:03,480
These are things where instead of
getting sucked in to the conversation,

3240
02:33:03,481 --> 02:33:07,320
like you were saying with the Ma many
entities that live in this land,

3241
02:33:07,620 --> 02:33:12,180
you just let that first thing hit you.
I've been cut off in traffic and then it

3242
02:33:12,181 --> 02:33:15,810
goes away and there might be these
thoughts flying around in your head

3243
02:33:15,811 --> 02:33:16,710
like,
Oh God,

3244
02:33:16,711 --> 02:33:18,090
what an asshole.
People suck.

3245
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:20,730
But instead of you reacting to those
thoughts,

3246
02:33:20,731 --> 02:33:22,410
you just watch them like,
oh wow,

3247
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:24,840
that's the part of my brain that thinks
people suck.

3248
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:26,400
Watch that.
Wow,

3249
02:33:26,401 --> 02:33:31,401
there it is and now it's gone.
And that practice makes you a much

3250
02:33:31,441 --> 02:33:35,850
happier person over time and you realize
what conflicts are real and what

3251
02:33:35,851 --> 02:33:38,280
conflicts are just artificial,
which ones you've made up,

3252
02:33:38,281 --> 02:33:41,100
which ones you've just,
and you've endorsed,

3253
02:33:41,370 --> 02:33:44,550
you've given them license to,
to participate in your emotions,

3254
02:33:44,551 --> 02:33:46,320
but they really don't exist at all.

3255
02:33:46,380 --> 02:33:48,810
The nonsense nonsense.
Someone cutting you off with nothing

3256
02:33:48,811 --> 02:33:50,340
even happened.
You didn't get in an accident?

3257
02:33:50,341 --> 02:33:50,911
No.
Oh,

3258
02:33:50,911 --> 02:33:53,370
so you ran into an asshole.
Welcome to Earth.

3259
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:54,570
Yeah,
there's a lot of them.

3260
02:33:54,690 --> 02:33:55,860
Right.
And guaranteed.

3261
02:33:55,861 --> 02:33:57,480
He didn't mean to like he did.
You know,

3262
02:33:57,490 --> 02:33:59,040
once,
once man,

3263
02:33:59,041 --> 02:34:00,420
I was like trying to like,
I,

3264
02:34:00,421 --> 02:34:03,900
I couldn't,
I was late to get radiation therapy.

3265
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:04,940
Uh,
and I,

3266
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:09,940
I cut somebody off in traffic cause I
had to go get my fucking body radiated

3267
02:34:10,021 --> 02:34:11,970
at a God damn radiation clinic and I'm
like,

3268
02:34:11,971 --> 02:34:15,180
I'm sick and I cut some off in traffic
and I remember they're like,

3269
02:34:15,181 --> 02:34:17,840
fuck yeah,
fuck yeah.

3270
02:34:17,841 --> 02:34:18,060
Or

3271
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:18,731
I'm like,
man,

3272
02:34:18,731 --> 02:34:20,380
I've got cancer,
dude.

3273
02:34:20,381 --> 02:34:23,260
I'm getting fried down in this clinic.
Trust me.

3274
02:34:23,261 --> 02:34:24,130
I'm,
I'm like,

3275
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:27,040
but now when any wood cuts me off,
usually I just think,

3276
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:29,260
man,
I bet that guy's going to get radiation

3277
02:34:29,261 --> 02:34:30,190
therapy,
man.

3278
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:33,850
Let's give him a fucking break today.
You don't know where he's going.

3279
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:35,800
You know,
she might just be getting back from an

3280
02:34:35,801 --> 02:34:38,380
abortion.
Like you don't understand what's

3281
02:34:38,381 --> 02:34:41,410
actually happening there.
And so if you let your mind trick you,

3282
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:43,450
then you'll get lost.
And that's the,

3283
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:46,750
that's the problem is it's like,
it's not the screaming after the guy

3284
02:34:46,751 --> 02:34:49,270
cuts you off.
It's when you realize that for the last

3285
02:34:49,271 --> 02:34:52,150
six years you've been reacting to
somebody,

3286
02:34:52,151 --> 02:34:55,660
cutting you off in traffic and it's
somebody you did some shitty thing to

3287
02:34:55,661 --> 02:34:58,840
you six years ago and you're still in
the fucking car,

3288
02:34:58,990 --> 02:35:00,490
you're still banging the seat.

3289
02:35:00,670 --> 02:35:02,320
Well,
how frustrating is it when you're dating

3290
02:35:02,321 --> 02:35:05,140
someone and they bring up some shit that
you argued with them about six months

3291
02:35:05,141 --> 02:35:08,350
ago and the worst,
the worst,

3292
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:09,310
the worst.
Summoning up,

3293
02:35:09,490 --> 02:35:13,090
summoning up this demon from the past
and then like puppeteering it,

3294
02:35:13,390 --> 02:35:15,630
you know,
like remember this Diarra member?

3295
02:35:15,660 --> 02:35:18,880
Do you remember you did that,
you did that and you could be talking

3296
02:35:18,881 --> 02:35:21,790
about something that happened right now
like Jesus Christ.

3297
02:35:21,791 --> 02:35:23,440
Did you leave the refrigerator door
open?

3298
02:35:23,830 --> 02:35:27,580
You fucking left the garage door opened
a year ago and I still haven't found my

3299
02:35:27,581 --> 02:35:28,414
bike.
Yeah,

3300
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:29,980
yeah,
yeah.

3301
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:32,850
What happened there?
It's,

3302
02:35:32,890 --> 02:35:34,660
I just asked you if you'd like to
refrigerator to open.

3303
02:35:34,690 --> 02:35:36,310
Yeah,
a fucking crazy bitch.

3304
02:35:36,340 --> 02:35:37,930
And then you realize live in a bad
neighborhood,

3305
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:41,380
but then you really realize that crazy
bitch lives in your brain because your

3306
02:35:41,381 --> 02:35:43,630
brain,
your brain is always bringing that shit

3307
02:35:43,631 --> 02:35:44,260
out her brain.

3308
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:45,820
How about fixing her brain?
She sat next to you.

3309
02:35:46,090 --> 02:35:50,500
You don't need to
start with the crazy girlfriend living

3310
02:35:50,501 --> 02:35:53,860
in your consciousness because that,
that that's the one that's causing you

3311
02:35:53,861 --> 02:35:55,690
all the problems.
If but what if you live in when the

3312
02:35:55,691 --> 02:35:59,210
girls crazier than the crazy girl in
your consciousness is like,

3313
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:00,910
yeah,
so this is like a,

3314
02:36:01,210 --> 02:36:04,360
I think a problem many people have to
deal with man,

3315
02:36:04,361 --> 02:36:07,570
which is like all right.
A lot of times you hear it like my

3316
02:36:07,571 --> 02:36:10,030
fucking parents are fucking out of their
mind,

3317
02:36:10,031 --> 02:36:12,070
you know?
And so you want to like change your

3318
02:36:12,071 --> 02:36:14,890
parents or you want to change the person
you're living.

3319
02:36:14,891 --> 02:36:18,190
Where do you want to change your kids
and a man?

3320
02:36:18,191 --> 02:36:20,290
I'm telling you if you really look at
the,

3321
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:23,330
I really like that a,
I've talked about it before.

3322
02:36:23,331 --> 02:36:27,110
If I really liked that Clint Eastwood
movie play misty for me it's like this

3323
02:36:27,111 --> 02:36:27,940
all you can get on.

3324
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:32,940
I think on itunes it's really good,
but this guy ends up fucking a fan and

3325
02:36:33,791 --> 02:36:35,570
the fan ends up,
uh,

3326
02:36:35,890 --> 02:36:40,120
stalking him.
But you realize that he was playing the

3327
02:36:40,121 --> 02:36:43,300
game with,
with this girl that he had fucked.

3328
02:36:43,301 --> 02:36:47,500
Like he was letting her in every single
time he was giving her a little bit of

3329
02:36:47,501 --> 02:36:49,120
something to move on.
Right?

3330
02:36:49,121 --> 02:36:54,121
And like if you're living with a crazy
person and you really analyze the game,

3331
02:36:54,570 --> 02:36:58,150
there are some rules of the game.
I'll tell you a few right away.

3332
02:36:58,180 --> 02:37:01,180
Number one,
you need a crazy person.

3333
02:37:01,210 --> 02:37:04,030
That's the first one.
So you decide this is a crazy person,

3334
02:37:04,031 --> 02:37:05,170
right?
That's rule number one.

3335
02:37:05,171 --> 02:37:07,000
I'm living with a fucking crazy person,
I guess.

3336
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:10,000
Really?
Well guess who's really fucking crazy?

3337
02:37:10,150 --> 02:37:12,640
The person who's decided to live with a
crazy person.

3338
02:37:12,820 --> 02:37:14,680
So there's two crazy people in the
house.

3339
02:37:14,710 --> 02:37:16,560
Well,
people change

3340
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:20,390
their behavior though for you.
And then once you move in with them,

3341
02:37:20,391 --> 02:37:24,110
you realize how nutty they are.
Unless you're like super fucking

3342
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:29,120
critical and objective and really
analyzing someone's behavior and you do

3343
02:37:29,121 --> 02:37:30,650
a background check.
I mean,

3344
02:37:30,651 --> 02:37:34,100
how many girls are room moved in with a
guy and they find out who was abusive

3345
02:37:34,101 --> 02:37:36,170
piece of shit once they got in that
you're right.

3346
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:38,390
That's true.
How many guys have been with a girl?

3347
02:37:38,391 --> 02:37:41,240
And then as the relationship goes on,
they start to blame you for their

3348
02:37:41,241 --> 02:37:45,650
failures in life and you become the
magnifying glass of all their

3349
02:37:46,250 --> 02:37:48,890
personality and perfection.
Get the fuck out of there.

3350
02:37:48,891 --> 02:37:51,290
But that's,
that's the only answer then.

3351
02:37:51,291 --> 02:37:52,880
But like if you're,
but yeah,

3352
02:37:52,881 --> 02:37:54,920
a lot of times,
a lot of times though,

3353
02:37:54,921 --> 02:37:58,720
man,
a lot of times if you look at,

3354
02:37:58,890 --> 02:38:00,440
and I don't just mean living with a
girl,

3355
02:38:00,441 --> 02:38:01,520
I mean living with anyone.

3356
02:38:01,670 --> 02:38:05,120
But if you look or being at work with
anyone or anyone you interact with on a

3357
02:38:05,121 --> 02:38:05,901
daily basis,
he,

3358
02:38:05,901 --> 02:38:06,780
you haven't,
uh,

3359
02:38:07,010 --> 02:38:11,450
some weird shit with right now.
The next time you're interacting with

3360
02:38:11,451 --> 02:38:13,700
them in a bat to get in the old classic
fight,

3361
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:15,650
you know,
just watch yourself.

3362
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:20,630
Just watch yourself gear up.
And you will notice a lot of the time

3363
02:38:20,960 --> 02:38:23,720
that you're the one who's getting into
this shit,

3364
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:26,510
that you're the ones you want it to
happen.

3365
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:30,310
You might notice a lot of the time,
I'm not saying that this is always the,

3366
02:38:30,311 --> 02:38:32,740
this sounds super personal.
Why I,

3367
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:35,690
well that's all I got is myself.
That's how the guys,

3368
02:38:35,691 --> 02:38:37,790
myself and this is like,
so this is the,

3369
02:38:37,791 --> 02:38:40,250
uh,
the concept is Shempa I've talked to,

3370
02:38:40,251 --> 02:38:41,570
I think I've talked about in the
podcast,

3371
02:38:41,580 --> 02:38:43,910
it's,
it's something Pema chodron talks about,

3372
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:46,910
which is a guy,
we're going back to archer again.

3373
02:38:46,910 --> 02:38:51,500
So shempa is the feeling of pulling back
the bowstring or the feeling of

3374
02:38:51,501 --> 02:38:53,030
preparing to strike,
right?

3375
02:38:53,031 --> 02:38:57,470
So with mindfulness you start learning
about that feeling,

3376
02:38:57,471 --> 02:38:59,870
right?
So someone starts pissing you off,

3377
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:03,260
who start preparing for battle.
You prepare for that and you realize

3378
02:39:03,261 --> 02:39:04,370
the,
your insults,

3379
02:39:04,610 --> 02:39:07,280
you want to be right.
You've pulled back the bow and you want

3380
02:39:07,281 --> 02:39:08,150
to be right.
Really,

3381
02:39:08,450 --> 02:39:10,670
you want to put the fucking couch there
really?

3382
02:39:10,850 --> 02:39:12,590
Because I just don't think it belongs
there.

3383
02:39:12,870 --> 02:39:14,840
He want to put the fucking couch there.
Now,

3384
02:39:14,841 --> 02:39:18,290
if you think about is there a right
place for the couch and the universe

3385
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:20,510
that we were just talking about much?
Don't put the cows in front of the

3386
02:39:20,511 --> 02:39:21,980
fireplace,
he'll catch on shore.

3387
02:39:21,981 --> 02:39:25,400
You're stupid foot.
Aesthetically we exist in a universe was

3388
02:39:25,401 --> 02:39:30,230
star clusters that are giving birth to
stars and you have decided this must be

3389
02:39:30,231 --> 02:39:31,850
the right place for the couch,
right?

3390
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:35,120
And that Shempa you're pulling it back.
You're going to fight this stupid fight

3391
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:36,860
when instead you could be like,
you know what?

3392
02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:39,260
Yeah,
that's a perfect place for the cat.

3393
02:39:39,290 --> 02:39:42,320
You know what happens when you do that?
You end up with a fucking chick house

3394
02:39:42,590 --> 02:39:45,590
and they dominate the whole place.
They start with a couch and then they

3395
02:39:45,591 --> 02:39:49,770
moved to the fucking sheets and next
thing you know your toothbrush,

3396
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:53,900
balance,
fluffy fucking fluffy cover over your

3397
02:39:53,901 --> 02:39:56,300
pillows.
You got Valentine's heart to hanging on

3398
02:39:56,301 --> 02:39:59,630
your Buddhists.
That's my five year old.

3399
02:39:59,631 --> 02:40:01,160
Put that up.
I love it man.

3400
02:40:01,400 --> 02:40:03,840
And sure you end up with that.
You end up with a chick house,

3401
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:07,210
but you know that's a little girl house.
That's slightly different than Chai.

3402
02:40:07,211 --> 02:40:10,040
We'll take chick houses different,
they'll start,

3403
02:40:10,041 --> 02:40:12,890
they'll start fucking putting scented
candles around.

3404
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:17,970
You'll come home some music and kate
will be planned and just let me listen.

3405
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:19,920
This one.
So here's what your mind just gay put

3406
02:40:19,921 --> 02:40:22,080
headphones on while you're on your
computer.

3407
02:40:22,210 --> 02:40:24,300
It's your care.
What I play really loud.

3408
02:40:24,301 --> 02:40:25,370
That's awful.
That would,

3409
02:40:25,380 --> 02:40:27,600
that's what you see.
Here's what the mind does.

3410
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:31,050
A thing happens.
The couch fight the mind.

3411
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:36,080
Instead of just thinking like in this
moment I'm getting in a fight and inside

3412
02:40:37,291 --> 02:40:40,860
of me,
my level of passion over this fucking

3413
02:40:40,861 --> 02:40:43,020
couch,
it's like I'm fighting for my life.

3414
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:44,970
So then you look at the,
well,

3415
02:40:44,971 --> 02:40:48,060
why am I getting so upset about this?
Because the mind is telling you,

3416
02:40:48,370 --> 02:40:50,910
mother fucker,
if this couch and stuff here,

3417
02:40:51,240 --> 02:40:54,390
it's going to be a matter of time before
she starts fucking a personal trainer

3418
02:40:54,391 --> 02:40:54,991
for a few.
Yeah.

3419
02:40:54,991 --> 02:40:58,200
If she starts fucking her trainer,
you're going to be wearing dresses.

3420
02:40:58,410 --> 02:40:59,520
You're going to,
you're going to end up,

3421
02:40:59,550 --> 02:41:02,010
you're gonna end up sucking or trainers
cock and you're going to meet a chick

3422
02:41:02,011 --> 02:41:03,780
house.
That's the mind telling us what I'm

3423
02:41:03,781 --> 02:41:04,591
saying.
Dude,

3424
02:41:04,591 --> 02:41:06,900
it's not real.
It's not real.

3425
02:41:06,901 --> 02:41:09,000
It's not as slippery as a battle going
on.

3426
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:16,080
Try to lose,
lose the battle.

3427
02:41:16,500 --> 02:41:18,960
I'm telling you right now,
if you have a mortgage,

3428
02:41:19,110 --> 02:41:21,600
don't lose the battle.
Don't lose the battle over the mortgage.

3429
02:41:21,601 --> 02:41:23,280
Don't lose the battle.
If you know,

3430
02:41:23,281 --> 02:41:25,890
if she wants you to sign up,
she doesn't want you to sign a prenup.

3431
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:27,240
Don't lose the bag.
No,

3432
02:41:27,241 --> 02:41:29,910
I'm not talking about those battles.
I'm as a real man.

3433
02:41:29,970 --> 02:41:31,580
Those are real battles.
I'm consequences.

3434
02:41:31,581 --> 02:41:34,770
I'm talking about in general,
most battles that you're fighting,

3435
02:41:35,010 --> 02:41:37,230
they don't have that much of a
consequence,

3436
02:41:37,231 --> 02:41:39,480
and if you really want to talk about
losing the fucking battle,

3437
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:42,780
and I'm not talking about rolling over
for your girlfriend or for your boss,

3438
02:41:42,781 --> 02:41:47,250
if for any of these people I'm talking
about those little tiny conflicts you

3439
02:41:47,251 --> 02:41:52,251
create so that you can feel what it's
like to overpower someone in win in

3440
02:41:52,501 --> 02:41:54,150
every single moment,
the winning thing,

3441
02:41:54,151 --> 02:41:54,960
I'm going to win.

3442
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:57,330
That's what I'm talking about.
That's like the most toxic thing in a

3443
02:41:57,331 --> 02:41:58,021
relationship,
right?

3444
02:41:58,021 --> 02:41:59,880
If you're with a girl and it's,
it becomes,

3445
02:42:00,300 --> 02:42:04,050
there wasn't a billy Joel Song about
that matter of trust.

3446
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,380
Just leave,
just lose practice losing.

3447
02:42:07,381 --> 02:42:11,000
And I
live in with,

3448
02:42:11,060 --> 02:42:12,450
how about,
here's the thing though,

3449
02:42:13,140 --> 02:42:16,890
I definitely believe that you're correct
in that you will attract the type of

3450
02:42:16,891 --> 02:42:21,720
people that you deserve in that sense
that you deserve with the way you

3451
02:42:21,721 --> 02:42:23,520
believe.
And the way you could run it in nutty

3452
02:42:23,521 --> 02:42:24,570
people,
you can fuck up.

3453
02:42:24,571 --> 02:42:26,880
You could say he could as ag for the
most part,

3454
02:42:26,881 --> 02:42:30,090
the people that you let in a lot,
a lot of times they reflect where you

3455
02:42:30,091 --> 02:42:33,960
are as person.
So if you find yourself involved in

3456
02:42:33,961 --> 02:42:35,580
these shitty relationships over and over
again,

3457
02:42:35,581 --> 02:42:38,280
you might want to look inward.
You might want to look at what you're

3458
02:42:38,281 --> 02:42:41,310
putting out there and what kind of
people you're letting in and what kind

3459
02:42:41,311 --> 02:42:44,850
of circles you're hanging around in and
what kind of interest you're pursuing,

3460
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:49,620
what kind of things you focusing on and
why is that led you to be engulfed in

3461
02:42:49,621 --> 02:42:50,640
this world of stupid?

3462
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:51,201
Well,
and,

3463
02:42:51,201 --> 02:42:52,690
and,
and yeah,

3464
02:42:52,780 --> 02:42:54,390
and in the world of stupid,
the era,

3465
02:42:54,391 --> 02:42:57,360
and it's like you're in the world of
stupid fine.

3466
02:42:57,361 --> 02:42:59,010
You,
you got into the world of stupid

3467
02:42:59,011 --> 02:43:03,120
whatever.
But really if you start looking at like

3468
02:43:03,450 --> 02:43:05,160
this is,
they call it threading the necklace,

3469
02:43:05,161 --> 02:43:06,810
right?
You're threading the fucking necklace

3470
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:10,620
every single moment you're threading,
this necklace is suffering.

3471
02:43:10,621 --> 02:43:11,860
So in every single moment

3472
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:15,310
you're bringing into that moment,
all the past battles,

3473
02:43:15,311 --> 02:43:17,860
you lost,
all the past battles you want,

3474
02:43:17,861 --> 02:43:20,800
all the compromises you made.
You're bringing into that moment your

3475
02:43:20,801 --> 02:43:24,520
idea of here's what's right and here's
what's wrong.

3476
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:28,810
And the question is how much of your
understanding of what's right and how

3477
02:43:28,811 --> 02:43:32,680
much of your understanding of what's
wrong is based on reality and how much

3478
02:43:32,681 --> 02:43:35,530
of it is based on your own desire to
win,

3479
02:43:35,531 --> 02:43:37,150
to overcome.
Then again,

3480
02:43:37,151 --> 02:43:37,780
man,
I'm not,

3481
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:42,780
I'm not advocating the concept of
becoming someone who's downtrodden and

3482
02:43:42,941 --> 02:43:47,350
some girl or boss or situation is like
clumping all over you.

3483
02:43:47,550 --> 02:43:49,790
But yeah,
I'll tell you again,

3484
02:43:49,820 --> 02:43:51,520
a fight with my girlfriend,
uh,

3485
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:52,593
like,
uh,

3486
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:54,120
a few months ago,
and I'm,

3487
02:43:54,121 --> 02:43:56,320
I'm sorry,
core of this is to purse.

3488
02:43:56,380 --> 02:44:00,610
I got this stupid fight.
She's got a picture of Bob Dylan,

3489
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,600
right?
Big,

3490
02:44:01,601 --> 02:44:05,110
big picture of Bob Dylan and were nice
framed,

3491
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:07,990
beautiful,
original print of Bob Dylan.

3492
02:44:07,990 --> 02:44:10,720
Right.
I don't like Bob Dylan.

3493
02:44:12,070 --> 02:44:13,150
You know,
I don't like him.

3494
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:14,540
He is,
don't you like him?

3495
02:44:14,590 --> 02:44:15,790
Because,
because he,

3496
02:44:15,850 --> 02:44:17,140
he,
he,

3497
02:44:17,350 --> 02:44:20,480
I saw an interview that he did when he
was like a super con.

3498
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:23,050
This is before the Kanye thing happened
and you know,

3499
02:44:23,051 --> 02:44:24,880
now that I think about it,
why don't I like Bob Dylan,

3500
02:44:24,881 --> 02:44:27,640
he's got a lot of great fucking songs.
Even though if he sat,

3501
02:44:27,850 --> 02:44:31,060
he sounds like a wallet,
a leather wallet started singing or

3502
02:44:31,061 --> 02:44:31,894
something.
It's like,

3503
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:34,780
I don't know why it annoys me.
And I like,

3504
02:44:34,781 --> 02:44:37,480
it doesn't matter.
I thought there's no real basis of

3505
02:44:37,481 --> 02:44:42,481
liking and not liking
it anyway.

3506
02:44:42,710 --> 02:44:43,440
Like,
so my,

3507
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:47,230
so I have a bad identification.
So she's got this cool picture of Bob

3508
02:44:47,230 --> 02:44:49,250
Dylan and she wants to put it in the
guestroom.

3509
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:50,133
Right,
right.

3510
02:44:50,260 --> 02:44:52,120
And I'm like,
fuck that fucking picture,

3511
02:44:52,121 --> 02:44:52,900
man.
You going to put,

3512
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:53,560
I got really mad.

3513
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:55,270
Like I don't want to fucking Bob Dylan
and the in the,

3514
02:44:55,271 --> 02:44:58,970
in the fucking guestroom.
You were explaining what it was that you

3515
02:44:58,971 --> 02:45:02,140
said before Kanya you got dust side.
You were saying there was a thing that

3516
02:45:02,141 --> 02:45:03,580
he did an interview that he,
Oh yeah,

3517
02:45:03,581 --> 02:45:05,980
he was just conti to some reporter or
whatever.

3518
02:45:05,981 --> 02:45:07,720
I don't know.
Maybe he's having a bad day.

3519
02:45:08,230 --> 02:45:10,240
People love Bob Dylan was when he was
young.

3520
02:45:10,270 --> 02:45:11,110
Yeah,
he's young.

3521
02:45:11,111 --> 02:45:11,701
Whatever.
It's,

3522
02:45:11,701 --> 02:45:13,210
it's not,
it doesn't matter.

3523
02:45:13,300 --> 02:45:16,930
He did nothing.
It's Bob Dylan is a great performer and

3524
02:45:16,931 --> 02:45:20,530
who the fuck am I to judge him?
My egoic brain doesn't like Bob Dylan

3525
02:45:20,531 --> 02:45:23,710
and it still doesn't like Bob Dylan.
I can't make myself like if I don't like

3526
02:45:23,711 --> 02:45:25,450
to listen to his music.
Oh No.

3527
02:45:25,451 --> 02:45:27,970
The watchtower.
I don't think it's a basis.

3528
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,700
Obviously I'm not,
I don't think it's based in reality,

3529
02:45:30,701 --> 02:45:32,410
but so like,
you know,

3530
02:45:32,411 --> 02:45:34,000
I'm like,
I don't want that picture up.

3531
02:45:34,480 --> 02:45:36,600
I don't want that picture of Bob Dylan
up in the guest.

3532
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:38,590
I'm like,
I don't want our guests to look at Bob

3533
02:45:38,590 --> 02:45:40,480
Dylan.
I'm being a dick man and like you know

3534
02:45:40,481 --> 02:45:42,190
what she does man,
puts it up there.

3535
02:45:42,191 --> 02:45:45,010
Anyway,
she takes it down and then like I come

3536
02:45:45,011 --> 02:45:49,000
into the guestroom and she's taken a
picture of Bob Dylan down and I'm like,

3537
02:45:49,001 --> 02:45:50,980
you took the picture of Bob Dylan down.
She's like,

3538
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:53,890
yeah,
I guess I'll just sell it on Ebay or

3539
02:45:53,891 --> 02:45:57,550
something.
And like in that moment I felt like the

3540
02:45:57,551 --> 02:46:01,120
biggest asshole ever live like God damn
it man.

3541
02:46:01,300 --> 02:46:04,060
I wanted to win this battle.
I wanted to win,

3542
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:09,010
I wanted to be the victor and I won.
What did I win a wall that doesn't have

3543
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:13,370
Bob Dylan on it and like my girlfriend
like having like,

3544
02:46:13,371 --> 02:46:16,520
Oh I guess I'm just going to sell this
picture that I like cause my boyfriend's

3545
02:46:16,521 --> 02:46:21,521
a deck and it's like that's not winning.
That's losing like that's fundamentally

3546
02:46:21,801 --> 02:46:26,480
losing on every single level.
Now I guess if she'd been like using the

3547
02:46:26,481 --> 02:46:29,960
picture of Bob Dylan and some kind of
like method of torture,

3548
02:46:29,961 --> 02:46:31,730
like till when herself,
it's different.

3549
02:46:31,731 --> 02:46:36,731
But all I'm saying is a lot of times we
make decisions that we think are in our

3550
02:46:37,311 --> 02:46:42,260
own best interest when really there
because we want to feel like we have

3551
02:46:42,261 --> 02:46:43,520
one,
like we're right,

3552
02:46:43,790 --> 02:46:47,600
we want to be right,
and sometimes you're not right because

3553
02:46:47,601 --> 02:46:49,160
there's no right or wrong answer.
Right.

3554
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:52,150
Let's get back to the root of why.
What are you doing in the first place?

3555
02:46:52,151 --> 02:46:54,610
Like why are you seeking conflict like
this?

3556
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:57,910
I think for a lot of people it's because
of what we were talking about earlier,

3557
02:46:58,090 --> 02:47:02,500
these primal needs that are not met,
these primal genetic needs and some of

3558
02:47:02,501 --> 02:47:06,670
those primal genetic needs or about
overcoming situations.

3559
02:47:06,671 --> 02:47:08,220
Overcoming adversity.
Yeah.

3560
02:47:08,290 --> 02:47:10,720
There's reward systems built into our
brain.

3561
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:14,740
That's why we give a fuck of a computer
beats us and go because we'd go is is a

3562
02:47:14,741 --> 02:47:17,110
test would test is something you tried
to overcome,

3563
02:47:17,111 --> 02:47:18,400
right?
You're trying to compete,

3564
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:20,440
so this,
this wanting to win with your

3565
02:47:20,441 --> 02:47:22,690
girlfriend.
It's a manifestation of some shit that's

3566
02:47:22,691 --> 02:47:26,920
deep in our DNA.
It's not just as simple as lose or just

3567
02:47:26,921 --> 02:47:29,920
let it happen.
It's as simple as you have some

3568
02:47:29,921 --> 02:47:32,770
programming in your body that you need
to address with.

3569
02:47:33,020 --> 02:47:33,853
Uh,
there's,

3570
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:38,410
there's certain activities that you can
pursue that can free you from all this

3571
02:47:38,411 --> 02:47:39,390
stupidity,
right?

3572
02:47:39,430 --> 02:47:42,580
It's tied up in you,
and it doesn't have to be that you,

3573
02:47:42,581 --> 02:47:44,380
you know,
you just let it go and you just lose.

3574
02:47:44,530 --> 02:47:45,311
Like there's,
there's,

3575
02:47:45,311 --> 02:47:48,490
there's other methodologies,
there's other ways to approach it.

3576
02:47:48,491 --> 02:47:51,880
And I think the holistic way is to do
the whole thing.

3577
02:47:52,050 --> 02:47:54,670
Let it be,
be aware of what the competition is,

3578
02:47:54,671 --> 02:47:58,680
but also drain your fucking body out of
all its excess energy because your body

3579
02:47:58,681 --> 02:48:01,490
is like an overflowing machine.
It's like a,

3580
02:48:01,491 --> 02:48:02,290
uh,
uh,

3581
02:48:02,290 --> 02:48:04,320
an engine.
There's too much gas pumping into,

3582
02:48:04,350 --> 02:48:06,370
right?
It's like choking and spitting on its

3583
02:48:06,371 --> 02:48:08,470
own energy.
It doesn't have an outlet.

3584
02:48:08,620 --> 02:48:10,950
You're in a fucking car all day.
You're drinking coffee all day,

3585
02:48:10,951 --> 02:48:13,240
or you're in a car in the morning,
you're drinking coffee all day.

3586
02:48:13,241 --> 02:48:14,170
You're stuck in a box.

3587
02:48:14,170 --> 02:48:15,820
You're sitting down,
you get up,

3588
02:48:15,821 --> 02:48:17,170
your back hurts,
you piss,

3589
02:48:17,171 --> 02:48:19,780
you fucking go back to work again.
You're barely moving.

3590
02:48:19,990 --> 02:48:23,170
You're barely moving and your body's
designed to run from cats.

3591
02:48:23,410 --> 02:48:27,560
Your body's designed to fucking build a
house because intruders or common it,

3592
02:48:27,610 --> 02:48:31,330
none of these needs are being met.
The needs of gathering up your own food.

3593
02:48:31,480 --> 02:48:34,600
That's why there's that primal,
crazy feeling when you catch a fish.

3594
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:38,530
That feeling when you got to fish,
when you bring a holy Shit,

3595
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:40,750
you could go to a store,
buy a fish.

3596
02:48:41,140 --> 02:48:42,990
It takes five seconds.
Yeah,

3597
02:48:43,020 --> 02:48:44,380
walk up to the counter.
Yeah,

3598
02:48:44,381 --> 02:48:46,360
give me one of those trout.
They prep it up.

3599
02:48:46,390 --> 02:48:47,710
They give it to you.
You're done,

3600
02:48:47,980 --> 02:48:49,900
but not does it feel like anything?
That's right.

3601
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:51,360
It doesn't feel,
you know,

3602
02:48:51,400 --> 02:48:55,240
imagine if it felt that good to buy a
fish and when you bought a fish,

3603
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:56,710
be like,
oh,

3604
02:48:56,711 --> 02:48:59,050
look at the size of his trout.
Wow.

3605
02:48:59,860 --> 02:49:02,410
Did you buy this?
Fish is amazing.

3606
02:49:02,411 --> 02:49:06,010
Where did you buy pictures of
everybody's instagram would be pictures

3607
02:49:06,011 --> 02:49:06,880
of the fish.
They just,

3608
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:10,620
if you show a picture of fish on
instagram,

3609
02:49:10,621 --> 02:49:13,440
you'd better be cooking that thing.
You better be explaining some delicious

3610
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:16,140
thing you,
but you could catch a fish.

3611
02:49:16,141 --> 02:49:17,220
You take a picture,
everybody goes,

3612
02:49:17,250 --> 02:49:18,720
aw man,
Nice Bass.

3613
02:49:18,790 --> 02:49:19,640
Right.
Good.

3614
02:49:20,500 --> 02:49:21,380
Yeah.
Right.

3615
02:49:21,620 --> 02:49:23,460
This is a primal thing.
That's right.

3616
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:26,180
And that primal things attached to the
shoot and I was fucking arrows,

3617
02:49:26,290 --> 02:49:27,750
right.
Make no mistake about it.

3618
02:49:27,751 --> 02:49:30,060
They used to be an effective tool.
Oh No.

3619
02:49:30,090 --> 02:49:33,240
The more you do stuff like that,
the last you're going to fight over

3620
02:49:33,241 --> 02:49:35,880
fucking Bob Dylan pictures.
Guaranteed.

3621
02:49:35,881 --> 02:49:38,520
At least have to do that.
You just got to train the body,

3622
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:41,430
make the body fucking move,
make it move,

3623
02:49:41,580 --> 02:49:43,530
get all that excess pull shit out of
you.

3624
02:49:43,610 --> 02:49:44,301
Yeah.
And,

3625
02:49:44,301 --> 02:49:46,010
and,
and the,

3626
02:49:46,060 --> 02:49:46,980
it's,
it's,

3627
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:50,220
you're right,
it's exercise is certainly one big part

3628
02:49:50,221 --> 02:49:50,671
of it,
man.

3629
02:49:50,671 --> 02:49:52,210
But there's La,
it's all,

3630
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:53,740
they're all connected,
all connect.

3631
02:49:53,740 --> 02:49:57,070
There is no,
there's no one thing that you,

3632
02:49:57,090 --> 02:49:58,860
you don't need.
And that whole puzzle,

3633
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:02,880
the main,
I think the main thing that you teach is

3634
02:50:02,881 --> 02:50:07,881
that you don't have to be trapped and
the gravitational field of whatever the

3635
02:50:08,581 --> 02:50:11,040
particular wife is that you happen to
find yourself.

3636
02:50:11,041 --> 02:50:13,770
And if you find yourself in a life that
you don't like,

3637
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:19,040
if you find yourself in a situation that
is not bringing you happiness,

3638
02:50:19,350 --> 02:50:24,350
then there are ways that you can escape.
That gravitational field takes work and

3639
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:26,400
it takes time.
It takes a lot of momentum.

3640
02:50:26,401 --> 02:50:27,900
It takes time.
And that's a big one.

3641
02:50:27,901 --> 02:50:31,440
And a lot of people quit before they get
through their saw.

3642
02:50:31,441 --> 02:50:34,920
Crazy statistic.
A not a statistic or they're a meme that

3643
02:50:34,921 --> 02:50:39,390
is probably pretty accurate.
It said 97% of the people work for the

3644
02:50:39,391 --> 02:50:42,090
3% of the people that didn't quit.
Alright.

3645
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:43,980
Yeah,
that's pretty good man.

3646
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:44,700
And,
and,

3647
02:50:44,700 --> 02:50:46,860
but you know,
the whole quitting thing failing.

3648
02:50:47,130 --> 02:50:49,470
That's good too.
You can feel learn from them.

3649
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:50,191
You learn.
Yeah.

3650
02:50:50,191 --> 02:50:53,700
The negative and positive feedback are
all important in the loop.

3651
02:50:53,790 --> 02:50:54,740
And the,
the,

3652
02:50:54,750 --> 02:50:59,250
the mind will tell you after you failed
a certain number of times that you will

3653
02:50:59,251 --> 02:51:00,480
never be able to do it.
I mean,

3654
02:51:00,481 --> 02:51:02,610
that's part of the thing.
That's the other trick of the mind.

3655
02:51:02,611 --> 02:51:03,410
The mind.
There's two,

3656
02:51:03,410 --> 02:51:04,740
the,
a lot of tricks than mine.

3657
02:51:04,741 --> 02:51:07,710
As one of the tricks.
The mind tells you this is the main

3658
02:51:07,711 --> 02:51:11,700
source of suffering for a lot of people
is that however you're feeling right now

3659
02:51:11,730 --> 02:51:16,230
is permanent.
So that's not the number one like bad

3660
02:51:16,231 --> 02:51:17,940
trip.
That's one big source of it.

3661
02:51:17,941 --> 02:51:21,300
You want to have a bad trip on acid when
you're in our three,

3662
02:51:21,690 --> 02:51:24,060
let your mind start telling you,
you're going to be like this forever.

3663
02:51:24,270 --> 02:51:25,350
I'm going to be like this forever,
man.

3664
02:51:25,351 --> 02:51:27,120
This is never going away.
Three hours.

3665
02:51:27,121 --> 02:51:29,520
I know this is never going to go.
It's near it and you will free.

3666
02:51:29,550 --> 02:51:31,800
You will freak.
You will freak out if you think you're

3667
02:51:31,801 --> 02:51:33,150
going to trip for infinity,
right?

3668
02:51:33,480 --> 02:51:37,830
So in the same way,
most suffering comes because people

3669
02:51:37,831 --> 02:51:39,240
think,
oh shit man,

3670
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:42,540
this situation I'm in,
I had to always going to be like this.

3671
02:51:42,541 --> 02:51:44,800
I'm always going to be fat.
I'm always going to have a shitty job

3672
02:51:44,801 --> 02:51:46,770
and always going to be broke.
I'm always going to be sad.

3673
02:51:46,771 --> 02:51:49,620
I'm never going to get out of this hole.
That's a lie.

3674
02:51:49,770 --> 02:51:51,570
That's not true.
If you look at your life,

3675
02:51:51,571 --> 02:51:55,260
you've always experienced a change in
your emotional state.

3676
02:51:55,470 --> 02:51:59,130
You've always experienced the change in
literally every single thing from your

3677
02:51:59,131 --> 02:52:02,580
body to your surroundings,
do your jobs to your girlfriends,

3678
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:03,713
boyfriends.

3679
02:52:03,780 --> 02:52:07,630
It all is in a constant of flux.
So when you realize that,

3680
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:11,500
then you can let go of the panic that
comes when you start thinking like,

3681
02:52:11,501 --> 02:52:13,060
shit,
this is going to be like this forever.

3682
02:52:13,090 --> 02:52:13,923
No,
it's not.

3683
02:52:14,050 --> 02:52:16,120
It's not.
It's going to change.

3684
02:52:16,121 --> 02:52:20,710
Your situation will change.
And once you start understanding that,

3685
02:52:20,890 --> 02:52:24,850
then it gives you some room to work.
It gives you some room to actually begin

3686
02:52:24,851 --> 02:52:27,730
to make shifts or to do experiments,
man.

3687
02:52:27,731 --> 02:52:29,440
But the mind will tell you,
oh,

3688
02:52:29,441 --> 02:52:31,090
you have failed.
Look,

3689
02:52:31,091 --> 02:52:32,560
you got fat again.
You got fucking,

3690
02:52:32,590 --> 02:52:33,730
I got fat.
I um,

3691
02:52:34,240 --> 02:52:35,080
man,
I got,

3692
02:52:35,350 --> 02:52:40,350
I was working out nonstop equinox.
I got my body fat down to 16%,

3693
02:52:41,861 --> 02:52:42,551
Joe Rogan.
For me,

3694
02:52:42,551 --> 02:52:43,780
that's a big deal.
It's pretty good.

3695
02:52:43,810 --> 02:52:45,940
Cause I got,
I get fat and uh,

3696
02:52:46,180 --> 02:52:48,940
I swell up,
I throw those fucking beers down,

3697
02:52:48,941 --> 02:52:52,030
the old tube,
five slices of fucking bread,

3698
02:52:52,031 --> 02:52:54,370
a beer and I pumped,
I've get fat.

3699
02:52:54,490 --> 02:52:57,940
So then I went on tour and I got fucking
fat again man.

3700
02:52:58,120 --> 02:53:00,370
And like literally fat,
overweight.

3701
02:53:00,371 --> 02:53:01,220
Cause I,
this might,

3702
02:53:01,630 --> 02:53:04,600
equinox doesn't let you pretend that I
think I'm all right.

3703
02:53:04,601 --> 02:53:06,130
They measure your body fat and I go,
yeah,

3704
02:53:06,131 --> 02:53:08,600
you're overweight.
So I fail.

3705
02:53:08,620 --> 02:53:12,310
What'd you get up to percentage?
I don't want to say man,

3706
02:53:12,790 --> 02:53:14,380
I just got just,
I got,

3707
02:53:14,410 --> 02:53:17,680
I'll tell you the percentage I got to by
describing the look of sadness and my

3708
02:53:17,681 --> 02:53:18,401
trainers,
I,

3709
02:53:18,401 --> 02:53:21,910
when the fucking printer thing came out,
like a combination surprise.

3710
02:53:21,950 --> 02:53:22,960
He's like,
wow,

3711
02:53:23,320 --> 02:53:26,610
that's how fat I got.
So I'm still a faryal but it's,

3712
02:53:26,680 --> 02:53:29,440
it's diminishing.
I've been working out three times a

3713
02:53:29,441 --> 02:53:31,690
week,
but God dammit I'm going to keep fucking

3714
02:53:31,691 --> 02:53:35,500
doing it is a matter of practice.
I'm going to get fat,

3715
02:53:35,710 --> 02:53:38,140
fine.
But every time we get fat I'm going to

3716
02:53:38,141 --> 02:53:38,890
fight against it.

3717
02:53:38,890 --> 02:53:40,720
Why you saying that you're going to get
fat?

3718
02:53:41,020 --> 02:53:42,760
Well,
I'm just saying if I do again,

3719
02:53:42,790 --> 02:53:44,740
but why are you saying it that way?
You're right.

3720
02:53:44,741 --> 02:53:45,690
That's bad.
Well,

3721
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:48,970
it seems like you're giving yourself a,
a loophole that's kind of fun to get fat

3722
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:50,710
really.
Well,

3723
02:53:50,711 --> 02:53:52,030
I mean,
in the process of eating,

3724
02:53:52,031 --> 02:53:53,800
when you're there in the hall,
it's no fun.

3725
02:53:53,801 --> 02:53:55,540
But like in the process of shoving
pizzas,

3726
02:53:55,541 --> 02:53:57,010
dying your throat,
nobody's like that.

3727
02:53:57,170 --> 02:53:58,780
Like if that,
if that wasn't fun,

3728
02:53:58,781 --> 02:54:01,480
then we'd have a,
a very different,

3729
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:04,960
uh,
it's very different shape of most

3730
02:54:04,961 --> 02:54:06,700
people.
And listen to everything that you just

3731
02:54:06,701 --> 02:54:07,410
said,
right?

3732
02:54:07,410 --> 02:54:10,120
But the way you thinking and hold on for
a second before you interject,

3733
02:54:10,190 --> 02:54:13,360
think about everything you're saying
about the way people think and about the

3734
02:54:13,361 --> 02:54:17,710
traps and the way you define your
patterns that you fall back into each

3735
02:54:17,711 --> 02:54:21,760
and every time.
Then think about the intense physical

3736
02:54:21,761 --> 02:54:24,670
health consequences that you have
intimately experienced.

3737
02:54:24,671 --> 02:54:28,390
And the fact that even though you've
gone through cancer,

3738
02:54:28,490 --> 02:54:32,920
yes,
you still will make yourself a like a

3739
02:54:32,921 --> 02:54:35,080
path that you're definitely going to go
down.

3740
02:54:35,081 --> 02:54:36,680
Where are you going to abuse your body,
right?

3741
02:54:36,820 --> 02:54:41,820
It put yourself into a state of shock
and overweight and making sure that you,

3742
02:54:42,111 --> 02:54:44,440
your body is compromised pretty
significantly.

3743
02:54:44,470 --> 02:54:45,071
Right?
You know,

3744
02:54:45,071 --> 02:54:46,780
when you,
when you really fat like that,

3745
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:48,940
you're pretty significantly compromised
telling anybody,

3746
02:54:48,941 --> 02:54:51,520
tell you any different.
All those people that like want to dance

3747
02:54:51,521 --> 02:54:52,870
around it and say,
you know,

3748
02:54:52,871 --> 02:54:55,600
I'm fat and I'm healthy.
Like that's not real.

3749
02:54:55,720 --> 02:54:58,270
It's not real.
You are not as healthy as you would be

3750
02:54:58,271 --> 02:55:01,990
if you're not fat.
You can be fairly robust and overweight,

3751
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:04,010
but you are,
you're

3752
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:05,900
compromised.
It doesn't mean that you are not

3753
02:55:05,901 --> 02:55:07,900
functional,
but you're most certainly compromised,

3754
02:55:07,901 --> 02:55:09,680
right?
You were at your best when your optimal

3755
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:11,930
and when,
when do you optimal your optimal when

3756
02:55:11,931 --> 02:55:14,030
you are at a low,
a fairly low body fat,

3757
02:55:14,060 --> 02:55:15,110
not,
not ridiculous.

3758
02:55:15,111 --> 02:55:18,410
You don't want to be shredded.
He want to be fairly healthy and you

3759
02:55:18,411 --> 02:55:21,560
want to have a lot of nutrients in your
diet and you want to keep your body away

3760
02:55:21,561 --> 02:55:22,830
from any bullshit,
right?

3761
02:55:22,880 --> 02:55:26,870
You want to keep your body way from any
fucking sugars and processed shit and

3762
02:55:27,170 --> 02:55:29,630
nitrates and all that fucking shit that
you get from.

3763
02:55:29,631 --> 02:55:33,770
Sure.
Sausage and Pepperoni and fucking Salami

3764
02:55:33,771 --> 02:55:38,771
sandwiches and coca cola and corn syrup,
all that shit that tastes so Gloria's

3765
02:55:38,990 --> 02:55:41,630
going down is killing your body.
It's true,

3766
02:55:41,631 --> 02:55:45,110
man.
So why after all that you just said,

3767
02:55:45,530 --> 02:55:48,680
would you give yourself that little,
the little loophole,

3768
02:55:48,681 --> 02:55:49,680
that little mouth pleasure.

3769
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:52,470
You're right and know you're right,
it isn't.

3770
02:55:52,630 --> 02:55:53,600
Okay.
So we'll say,

3771
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:54,350
okay.
Right,

3772
02:55:54,350 --> 02:55:56,450
so,
so like when we were talking about it

3773
02:55:56,451 --> 02:55:58,340
being intimate,
like this is very intimate.

3774
02:55:58,341 --> 02:56:00,590
It's great your talk,
but you're talking about you.

3775
02:56:00,650 --> 02:56:01,310
Yeah.
Right.

3776
02:56:01,310 --> 02:56:04,010
You are talking about you and you're
defining this,

3777
02:56:04,011 --> 02:56:07,730
this struggle and balance and battle.
And then at the end of this

3778
02:56:07,731 --> 02:56:09,360
inspirational thing,
you give yourself a loop.

3779
02:56:09,361 --> 02:56:11,090
All this is what I do.
I get fat and then that,

3780
02:56:11,091 --> 02:56:13,250
but when I get fat,
I get healthy again.

3781
02:56:13,251 --> 02:56:14,330
Fucking right.
All right.

3782
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:15,021
Okay.
Okay.

3783
02:56:15,021 --> 02:56:15,850
You're right.
It's,

3784
02:56:15,850 --> 02:56:18,110
it's gotta be like,
I think as I think about this,

3785
02:56:18,111 --> 02:56:19,340
right,
I do think about this,

3786
02:56:19,400 --> 02:56:21,020
right?
So why do I do this?

3787
02:56:21,050 --> 02:56:23,330
This loop,
this clear loop in my life,

3788
02:56:23,360 --> 02:56:26,000
which I it,
I've gone through a few repetitions of

3789
02:56:26,001 --> 02:56:28,760
this where I'll get close to getting in
shape.

3790
02:56:28,790 --> 02:56:30,890
I won't be what I would consider in
shape.

3791
02:56:30,891 --> 02:56:33,710
I'll get close and then I'll fuck it all
up.

3792
02:56:33,800 --> 02:56:37,430
So why am I building this house of cards
and then knocking it down again?

3793
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:41,450
And especially after having gotten sick,
why would I keep doing that?

3794
02:56:41,470 --> 02:56:42,303
Right,
right.

3795
02:56:42,410 --> 02:56:44,150
So man,
I mean,

3796
02:56:44,360 --> 02:56:47,330
look,
I would love to have like a quick answer

3797
02:56:47,331 --> 02:56:50,420
for that awesome question.
But I don't,

3798
02:56:50,450 --> 02:56:51,380
I mean I could like,

3799
02:56:52,250 --> 02:56:52,590
yeah,

3800
02:56:52,590 --> 02:56:55,080
I don't know.
I could give some easy answer that like,

3801
02:56:55,560 --> 02:56:57,960
but it wouldn't be the right answer.
I really don't know.

3802
02:56:57,990 --> 02:56:58,823
You allow it.

3803
02:57:02,380 --> 02:57:05,170
Right.
Let's move it right now.

3804
02:57:05,180 --> 02:57:06,520
So it's what it all is.
You're right.

3805
02:57:06,521 --> 02:57:07,550
I'm not a victim,
right.

3806
02:57:07,990 --> 02:57:08,823
No.
Look,

3807
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:10,840
there's a reason why you don't smoke
cigarettes,

3808
02:57:11,500 --> 02:57:12,130
right?
Yeah.

3809
02:57:12,130 --> 02:57:14,590
Cause you don't allow them,
right.

3810
02:57:14,620 --> 02:57:16,720
You allow all this other stuff.
You say,

3811
02:57:16,721 --> 02:57:18,490
I'm going to eat shitty food,
I'm going to get fat.

3812
02:57:18,491 --> 02:57:21,130
I love throwing beard on my face and
then you allow it,

3813
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:24,400
right?
So you allow yourself some mouth

3814
02:57:24,401 --> 02:57:26,530
pleasure or some,
you know,

3815
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:30,340
uh,
some alcohol in intoxication pleasure.

3816
02:57:30,670 --> 02:57:32,240
You'll allow yourself that.
Right.

3817
02:57:32,350 --> 02:57:36,580
And you suffer the health quants
consequences like readily you like you

3818
02:57:36,581 --> 02:57:38,170
just,
it's this part of the program.

3819
02:57:38,410 --> 02:57:40,540
The mouth pleasure is more important
than the health.

3820
02:57:40,810 --> 02:57:42,100
So you allow it.
Yeah,

3821
02:57:42,160 --> 02:57:43,690
that's it.
But you don't allow other shit,

3822
02:57:43,870 --> 02:57:45,040
you know,
like if somebody gave you a bottle

3823
02:57:45,041 --> 02:57:46,840
oxycontin's you wouldn't be like,
oh no,

3824
02:57:47,140 --> 02:57:49,550
I can't eat these all day.
I know.

3825
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:50,393
Allow it.

3826
02:57:51,130 --> 02:57:51,490
Yeah.

3827
02:57:51,490 --> 02:57:56,410
Well I mean I'd probably take a couple.
You would too.

3828
02:57:56,411 --> 02:57:57,920
Right?
You like those things,

3829
02:57:59,140 --> 02:57:59,591
but yeah,
no,

3830
02:57:59,591 --> 02:58:00,291
I know what you mean,
man.

3831
02:58:00,291 --> 02:58:01,620
You know what I'm saying?
I mean allow it.

3832
02:58:01,650 --> 02:58:02,010
Sure,

3833
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:02,790
sure,
sure.

3834
02:58:02,790 --> 02:58:05,310
I've gotten fat.
I've gotten pretty close to being fat.

3835
02:58:05,330 --> 02:58:06,930
Like for me,
for me,

3836
02:58:06,931 --> 02:58:07,660
I've gotten,
you know,

3837
02:58:07,660 --> 02:58:11,100
I can think of that the heaviest I got,
I was like two oh four or two oh five or

3838
02:58:11,101 --> 02:58:14,850
something like that.
That's 10 15 pounds overweight.

3839
02:58:14,851 --> 02:58:15,684
For me,
for real.

3840
02:58:15,750 --> 02:58:18,190
Like I really shouldn't,
like my face gets fat and good it,

3841
02:58:18,820 --> 02:58:20,160
I'll get it here.
I get it.

3842
02:58:20,161 --> 02:58:22,020
Like down here,
I started to get a little bit of this

3843
02:58:22,021 --> 02:58:23,640
and I could see it,
I could see it in my face,

3844
02:58:23,790 --> 02:58:25,560
I could see it in my sides,
you know?

3845
02:58:26,070 --> 02:58:31,070
And,
but that was all because I didn't work

3846
02:58:32,600 --> 02:58:35,640
out hard enough in relationship to how
much collars I was consuming.

3847
02:58:35,700 --> 02:58:37,140
Yeah.
It's not that I ever stopped working

3848
02:58:37,141 --> 02:58:38,700
out,
but I was eating too much.

3849
02:58:38,730 --> 02:58:39,960
I was eating too much for what I was
doing.

3850
02:58:40,350 --> 02:58:42,390
But I get to a point where I realize it
and then I go,

3851
02:58:42,391 --> 02:58:43,560
okay,
I see what we're doing here.

3852
02:58:43,770 --> 02:58:46,620
Don't get fat.
Get like kind of close to fat.

3853
02:58:46,770 --> 02:58:48,420
Realize what you're doing and don't do
it again.

3854
02:58:49,170 --> 02:58:51,180
If you allow yourself to get too far
gone,

3855
02:58:51,210 --> 02:58:54,080
then you create this fucking gigantic
divid that you can't get out of it.

3856
02:58:54,081 --> 02:58:55,210
It's the worst.
And I get,

3857
02:58:55,260 --> 02:58:58,110
if I got the worst I got like when I
hurt my back,

3858
02:58:58,350 --> 02:59:01,230
it was also what was going on to cause.
So what couldn't work out as intensely

3859
02:59:01,470 --> 02:59:04,260
when I was about 10 pounds heavier than
I am now.

3860
02:59:04,710 --> 02:59:09,710
The worst that it got was all wrapped
around like feeling sorry because of an

3861
02:59:11,011 --> 02:59:15,720
injury not being as disciplined as I
could be and allowing myself the

3862
02:59:15,721 --> 02:59:18,180
indulgence,
figuring I'm going to make up for it

3863
02:59:18,181 --> 02:59:22,290
later so I'm not,
I'm guilty of the same sort of behavior

3864
02:59:22,291 --> 02:59:25,890
I'm making you aware of by just,
I'm not guilty of it right now.

3865
02:59:26,130 --> 02:59:29,130
Like right now I'm on the straight and
narrow and I'm pretty healthy about it

3866
02:59:29,131 --> 02:59:33,960
and I'm pretty decided that this is how
many eat from now on with rare

3867
02:59:33,961 --> 02:59:38,220
indulgences just from mouth play.
But I think that mouth pleasure can't be

3868
02:59:38,221 --> 02:59:39,840
the big one.
I can't be,

3869
02:59:39,870 --> 02:59:43,620
it's just not good for you.
Now the big one should be health health

3870
02:59:43,621 --> 02:59:46,440
should be the big one.
Mouth pleasure should be the occasional

3871
02:59:46,441 --> 02:59:49,350
foray.
It can't be daily mouth pleasure.

3872
02:59:49,660 --> 02:59:50,700
God Damn.
It's like,

3873
02:59:50,730 --> 02:59:54,240
I'll tell you man,
like when I'm like shoving some kind of

3874
02:59:54,241 --> 02:59:57,870
shitty food into my mouth,
it's like such a,

3875
02:59:57,900 --> 03:00:02,370
it's got such a strong gravity for me.
Like the moment I kick into that mode,

3876
03:00:02,371 --> 03:00:04,320
like when I'm not doing it.
God,

3877
03:00:04,321 --> 03:00:05,730
man,
I was so cool and I was training with

3878
03:00:05,731 --> 03:00:08,250
this guy for a while.
And you start getting into that and to

3879
03:00:08,251 --> 03:00:10,140
health and like you start getting into
that place.

3880
03:00:10,140 --> 03:00:14,640
It's incredible and that stuff holds
less of a gravitational pull.

3881
03:00:14,641 --> 03:00:17,450
But man,
I guess it's some form of addiction or

3882
03:00:17,451 --> 03:00:20,070
is 100% of form of addiction.
It's dopamine.

3883
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:22,920
There was a whole article about it
recently and one of those scientific

3884
03:00:22,921 --> 03:00:23,680
American,
I think,

3885
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:26,430
or one of those science journals that
was,

3886
03:00:26,431 --> 03:00:28,650
uh,
talking about why it's so difficult for

3887
03:00:28,651 --> 03:00:32,340
people to quit bad habits because you,
you,

3888
03:00:32,341 --> 03:00:34,200
those bad habits,
they,

3889
03:00:34,290 --> 03:00:38,670
the trigger dopamine releases in your
mind when you remember how great it was

3890
03:00:38,671 --> 03:00:40,380
to eat those donuts.
Fuck it.

3891
03:00:40,381 --> 03:00:41,700
Let's just do it.
Fuck it.

3892
03:00:41,701 --> 03:00:43,560
Let's just give it an to have that
burger and a beer.

3893
03:00:43,590 --> 03:00:45,990
Oh,
this is is glorious.

3894
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:51,620
But the problem is in you,
you allow those pathways to exist.

3895
03:00:52,170 --> 03:00:53,760
If it's not,
if you don't allow it,

3896
03:00:53,940 --> 03:00:55,620
if the cigarettes never get in your
body,

3897
03:00:55,621 --> 03:00:58,950
like I don't allow cigarettes.
I'm pretty sure he gives you cancer.

3898
03:00:59,110 --> 03:01:01,900
I see people smoking cigarettes.
I know they get tired quicker.

3899
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:03,670
I know it's terrible for you,
right?

3900
03:01:03,760 --> 03:01:06,130
So I don't allow it.
When I see people smoking cigarettes,

3901
03:01:06,131 --> 03:01:06,511
I'm like,
what?

3902
03:01:06,511 --> 03:01:09,190
And he allowed cigarettes into his life
and that's what you're doing,

3903
03:01:09,310 --> 03:01:10,660
right?
Like it's not that I couldn't get

3904
03:01:10,661 --> 03:01:12,190
addicted.
I think we can all get addicted.

3905
03:01:12,340 --> 03:01:15,490
If I started smoking cigarettes and I
realize oh there's a cognitive benefit

3906
03:01:15,670 --> 03:01:18,370
to smoke it on these things,
I'm just going to puff on a couple of

3907
03:01:18,370 --> 03:01:19,690
day.
There'll be die head smoke,

3908
03:01:19,810 --> 03:01:22,060
maybe a half a pack if I'm stressed.
Right.

3909
03:01:22,090 --> 03:01:23,950
Next thing you know I'm freaking out
because I can't get a pack of

3910
03:01:23,951 --> 03:01:25,000
cigarettes.
Why?

3911
03:01:25,030 --> 03:01:29,170
Cause I will allow this demon into my
life and I think the same exist with

3912
03:01:29,171 --> 03:01:32,350
processed sugar and getting off of sugar
for just a few days.

3913
03:01:32,470 --> 03:01:34,630
Just a few days,
which is not that difficult to thing.

3914
03:01:34,631 --> 03:01:38,470
You just give yourself a pattern for
five days that you have to follow.

3915
03:01:38,680 --> 03:01:41,170
This is all I'm allowed to eat.
This is all just do it for five days.

3916
03:01:41,500 --> 03:01:44,170
You get headaches,
you realize how crazy it is.

3917
03:01:44,171 --> 03:01:45,870
Shitty headaches.
You start losing weight,

3918
03:01:45,871 --> 03:01:47,500
your,
your body starts looking different.

3919
03:01:47,501 --> 03:01:50,530
You start getting thinner,
you start being less inflamed.

3920
03:01:50,650 --> 03:01:54,820
Sugar is a fucking monster.
So they said may exist in the form of

3921
03:01:54,821 --> 03:01:56,020
alcohol to my friend.
Oh,

3922
03:01:56,021 --> 03:01:57,670
I know.
That's the same goddamn thing.

3923
03:01:57,990 --> 03:02:00,840
Pull the pull of alcohol is the same
sugar.

3924
03:02:01,070 --> 03:02:03,640
Same with sugar.
It's the same pool of the bread,

3925
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:07,540
the same pool of the Pasta Pasta today.
To this day,

3926
03:02:07,541 --> 03:02:10,690
it drives me crazy.
If you had a bowl of linguine with clams

3927
03:02:10,930 --> 03:02:11,700
right now,
it's like,

3928
03:02:11,700 --> 03:02:13,890
aw,
look at that.

3929
03:02:14,170 --> 03:02:19,170
Laureus just Mao health food,
just bad health.

3930
03:02:20,280 --> 03:02:21,870
Just glue.
I know,

3931
03:02:21,871 --> 03:02:23,550
man.
Laurie is glue.

3932
03:02:24,100 --> 03:02:25,530
Well,
it's called a watch yourself.

3933
03:02:25,620 --> 03:02:29,610
It's cool to watch yourself get sucked
into it and it is like,

3934
03:02:29,611 --> 03:02:30,990
you know the thing you're making me
realize.

3935
03:02:30,991 --> 03:02:33,600
It's like a,
I've never thought of myself as a

3936
03:02:33,601 --> 03:02:36,660
victim,
but anytime you trick yourself into

3937
03:02:36,661 --> 03:02:41,661
thinking this is what I do,
then you have tricked yourself into

3938
03:02:41,821 --> 03:02:44,610
becoming a victim.
You've decided you're a victim.

3939
03:02:44,670 --> 03:02:45,750
Well,
it's more importantly,

3940
03:02:45,751 --> 03:02:48,750
it's contrary to the entire two hours
and 20 minutes.

3941
03:02:48,751 --> 03:02:50,670
And you were talking about,
you're right for that moment.

3942
03:02:50,700 --> 03:02:52,200
Yeah.
It's a massive flaw.

3943
03:02:52,230 --> 03:02:52,800
You're right.
It's,

3944
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:53,790
it's not a flaw.

3945
03:02:54,220 --> 03:02:56,400
It's just a pattern that you allow,
right.

3946
03:02:56,410 --> 03:02:58,620
Because you've had it in your life and
it's,

3947
03:02:58,740 --> 03:02:59,860
it's such a struggle

3948
03:03:00,640 --> 03:03:01,990
excepted.
It's existence.

3949
03:03:02,020 --> 03:03:02,650
You're right,
man.

3950
03:03:02,650 --> 03:03:03,430
You're right.
You're right.

3951
03:03:03,430 --> 03:03:04,800
This is where the rubber hits the road,
man.

3952
03:03:04,801 --> 03:03:07,570
That's why I love you as my friend,
but it's like these kinds of,

3953
03:03:07,571 --> 03:03:09,730
uh,
these kinds of patterns.

3954
03:03:09,731 --> 03:03:12,520
Like I guess the next time I find myself
now,

3955
03:03:12,521 --> 03:03:16,360
see there I'm doing it again.
I guess when I'm eating cake or the next

3956
03:03:16,361 --> 03:03:18,400
time I'm putting some shitty sugar into
my math,

3957
03:03:18,850 --> 03:03:22,900
I just have to realize I'm threading the
necklace right now.

3958
03:03:22,901 --> 03:03:27,901
Like I'm the one who's like creating the
version of myself where I'm a little bit

3959
03:03:28,571 --> 03:03:30,640
out of shape and yes,
you know,

3960
03:03:30,641 --> 03:03:33,250
and just as long as you realize that
you're the one doing it,

3961
03:03:33,460 --> 03:03:35,800
that just throws you into such a funny
predicament though,

3962
03:03:35,801 --> 03:03:38,020
right?
Because when you realize like shit,

3963
03:03:38,140 --> 03:03:42,160
I am completely in control of who I am
as a person.

3964
03:03:42,280 --> 03:03:43,900
Right?
And in this situation,

3965
03:03:44,200 --> 03:03:49,200
I'm making the decision to sculpt a
version of myself that sucks.

3966
03:03:49,440 --> 03:03:51,400
Or you know,
and,

3967
03:03:51,401 --> 03:03:52,700
and,
and why.

3968
03:03:53,140 --> 03:03:55,540
And when you instill,
like when you and your defined by this

3969
03:03:55,541 --> 03:03:57,110
past version of you,
right?

3970
03:03:57,160 --> 03:03:58,130
Like with all the knowledge

3971
03:03:58,130 --> 03:04:00,710
that you have right now in your head,
you're still defined by all these

3972
03:04:00,711 --> 03:04:02,260
failures from a decade ago.
Right?

3973
03:04:02,290 --> 03:04:02,960
More,
right.

3974
03:04:02,960 --> 03:04:05,720
They're all fucking rolling around in
your head that you have to repeat them.

3975
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:07,400
This is what I do,
man.

3976
03:04:07,700 --> 03:04:08,421
No,
you're totally right.

3977
03:04:08,421 --> 03:04:09,650
Yeah.
It's still cool.

3978
03:04:09,710 --> 03:04:11,090
Total blind spot,
man.

3979
03:04:11,091 --> 03:04:13,190
You're right though.
That is a way that I talked to myself.

3980
03:04:13,191 --> 03:04:15,210
Everybody does it.
What I do,

3981
03:04:15,211 --> 03:04:17,840
man,
to find her sets fucking hilarious.

3982
03:04:18,120 --> 03:04:21,110
Well at the mind is so goddamn tricky
that,

3983
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:23,090
yeah,
man.

3984
03:04:23,091 --> 03:04:25,220
That's really cool.
Here's one thing that I've gotten out of

3985
03:04:25,221 --> 03:04:28,580
this wacky diet that I'm on for the last
16 days or so,

3986
03:04:28,581 --> 03:04:30,170
17 days,
whatever it is right now,

3987
03:04:30,410 --> 03:04:32,120
it's something after two weeks,
right?

3988
03:04:34,220 --> 03:04:35,240
I'm not less happy.

3989
03:04:36,740 --> 03:04:37,460
Oh,
right.

3990
03:04:37,460 --> 03:04:40,240
I'm not,
I'm not less happy from eating shitty

3991
03:04:40,241 --> 03:04:40,851
food,
right?

3992
03:04:40,851 --> 03:04:42,910
Like my kids had cupcakes last night
after dinner.

3993
03:04:42,911 --> 03:04:44,320
There's a little cupcakes,
little tiny ones.

3994
03:04:44,321 --> 03:04:46,570
They have 10 grams of sugar.
One fucking little tiny cupcake.

3995
03:04:47,100 --> 03:04:48,810
That's insane.
Like how much is a big one happened

3996
03:04:48,830 --> 03:04:50,950
anyway,
I didn't feel bad.

3997
03:04:51,370 --> 03:04:56,200
I don't feel bad that I'm not getting to
eat a cupcake and I don't feel bad that

3998
03:04:56,201 --> 03:04:58,810
I'm not eating a bowl of pasta.
It looks amazing.

3999
03:04:58,960 --> 03:05:02,350
I bet it's great when it goes down.
It's not affecting my happiness,

4000
03:05:02,860 --> 03:05:06,700
but if I got fat,
would it affect my happiness if I looked

4001
03:05:06,701 --> 03:05:07,660
at myself in the mirror,
I'm like,

4002
03:05:07,661 --> 03:05:10,560
you fucking slaw.
What does all this shit I can't wrap

4003
03:05:10,570 --> 03:05:13,000
around here?
And there's all this stuff that affects

4004
03:05:13,001 --> 03:05:15,160
my happiness.
It affects the way I move.

4005
03:05:15,340 --> 03:05:17,110
It affects the way my body recovers.

4006
03:05:17,260 --> 03:05:19,930
It affects the way my energy levels are,
right?

4007
03:05:19,931 --> 03:05:24,820
The food I eat 100% affects the way my
entire day goes.

4008
03:05:25,060 --> 03:05:30,060
If I eat a big ass salad in the morning
with Avocados and olive oil and Balsamic

4009
03:05:30,821 --> 03:05:35,821
vinegarette and I eat that and I,
then I have some coconut oil or mct oil

4010
03:05:35,861 --> 03:05:37,870
and some coffee,
and then I have,

4011
03:05:38,020 --> 03:05:39,520
you know,
maybe a small,

4012
03:05:39,521 --> 03:05:44,260
a bowl of blueberries with some plain
yogurt and I'm eating like nothing but

4013
03:05:44,261 --> 03:05:46,570
healthy food.
And then I'll have like an elk steak

4014
03:05:46,571 --> 03:05:47,860
with some asparagus.
Dude,

4015
03:05:47,861 --> 03:05:50,110
I feel fucking great.
I feel great.

4016
03:05:50,350 --> 03:05:53,470
I've got crazy energy.
My energy levels were very high.

4017
03:05:53,620 --> 03:05:56,230
I'm drinking water all the time.
No juices,

4018
03:05:56,380 --> 03:05:57,790
no bullshit,
no sugar,

4019
03:05:57,820 --> 03:06:00,160
no nothing.
I am more happy.

4020
03:06:00,990 --> 03:06:03,840
I'm not less happy because I'm not
getting the sugar right.

4021
03:06:03,870 --> 03:06:06,000
It was only for a couple days.
It's a trick,

4022
03:06:06,020 --> 03:06:07,530
right?
It's a fucking trick.

4023
03:06:07,531 --> 03:06:09,380
We've all fallen into man,
right?

4024
03:06:09,570 --> 03:06:11,880
We look at that.
We'd go to get a Burrito and you get a

4025
03:06:11,881 --> 03:06:13,800
fucking soda and you're like,
Yay.

4026
03:06:14,340 --> 03:06:18,900
But the things that you're getting the
pleasure out of our tricks and they're

4027
03:06:18,901 --> 03:06:21,900
not there.
It's a temporary thing that will ruin

4028
03:06:21,901 --> 03:06:24,570
the rest of the enjoyment of your
experience in life.

4029
03:06:24,590 --> 03:06:26,490
Right?
It will sabotage it.

4030
03:06:26,610 --> 03:06:30,510
It'll make it less effective.
It'll make your brain work shittier when

4031
03:06:30,511 --> 03:06:33,180
your brain is processing a giant bowl of
pasta.

4032
03:06:33,360 --> 03:06:35,720
Good luck winning jeopardy,
right?

4033
03:06:35,980 --> 03:06:38,580
Fucking luck.
Your brain's going to be dog shit with a

4034
03:06:38,581 --> 03:06:41,190
bowl of spaghetti and meatballs and a
beer.

4035
03:06:41,310 --> 03:06:44,280
You've got a dumb fucking brain.
She got a brain.

4036
03:06:44,281 --> 03:06:44,941
It's like,
you know,

4037
03:06:44,941 --> 03:06:46,770
everything's shut her down.
Shut her down,

4038
03:06:46,860 --> 03:06:48,240
shut off,
functions down.

4039
03:06:48,330 --> 03:06:50,490
You've got critical functions,
just eh,

4040
03:06:50,790 --> 03:06:52,650
heartbeat.
Breathe.

4041
03:06:52,710 --> 03:06:53,970
Make sure you figured out how to get
home.

4042
03:06:54,150 --> 03:06:56,460
All the other fucking the universe

4043
03:06:56,460 --> 03:06:59,520
and reestablishing your existence and no
title.

4044
03:06:59,640 --> 03:07:01,140
Sorry.
Bowlful of Shit.

4045
03:07:01,680 --> 03:07:04,670
We just throw it down the hatch.
You've got to fucking process now.

4046
03:07:05,100 --> 03:07:06,150
I mean,
you know,

4047
03:07:06,180 --> 03:07:11,180
in most
religious traditions and especially most

4048
03:07:12,151 --> 03:07:15,990
meditative practices,
one thing you never hear people say is

4049
03:07:16,510 --> 03:07:17,730
she see you,
whatever you want,

4050
03:07:18,880 --> 03:07:22,560
or we're going to just do this thing.
You just eat whatever you want and it'll

4051
03:07:22,590 --> 03:07:25,620
usually,
there's like some fairly like strict

4052
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:29,280
ideas of like what to eat.
Usually it involves eating very simple

4053
03:07:29,281 --> 03:07:30,001
foods.
You know,

4054
03:07:30,001 --> 03:07:32,250
just like eating lentils,
rice,

4055
03:07:32,370 --> 03:07:36,000
but being very simple and what you,
what you eat and eating much less than

4056
03:07:36,001 --> 03:07:37,710
what you eat.
Fasting.

4057
03:07:37,960 --> 03:07:42,390
A lot of people recommend fasting.
Fasting has a scientific reason behind

4058
03:07:42,391 --> 03:07:44,340
it,
and it's the same thing that I'm trying

4059
03:07:44,341 --> 03:07:47,100
to do with this diet.
It's establishing ketosis.

4060
03:07:47,170 --> 03:07:50,670
S a a state of ketosis where your body's
living off of fat.

4061
03:07:50,850 --> 03:07:54,860
One of the best ways to do that is
intermittent fasting right fast and

4062
03:07:54,861 --> 03:07:59,280
gives your body a chance to process all
the food that it has in its system and

4063
03:07:59,281 --> 03:08:04,080
then switch over to using fats.
This is a normal part of being a person

4064
03:08:04,260 --> 03:08:07,860
because being a human being for the
longest time did not mean three square

4065
03:08:07,861 --> 03:08:08,840
meals a day,
right?

4066
03:08:08,930 --> 03:08:12,540
It meant going on these journeys where
you didn't get any food for a couple of

4067
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:14,400
days.
And if your body is glucose based,

4068
03:08:14,401 --> 03:08:16,830
and obviously I'm not a fucking
scientist and obviously there's a lot of

4069
03:08:16,831 --> 03:08:20,250
people that disagree with me and there's
a lot of people that disagree with Mark

4070
03:08:20,250 --> 03:08:22,110
Sisson and all these other people,
the Augustino,

4071
03:08:22,111 --> 03:08:26,300
all these different scientists and
biologists who swear by this key to

4072
03:08:26,310 --> 03:08:28,590
genic diet.
It is a very controversial thing.

4073
03:08:28,591 --> 03:08:30,750
So let me just say this right away.
I'm not a scientist,

4074
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:31,590
I'm just trying it out.

4075
03:08:31,590 --> 03:08:36,210
But the reasoning behind it to me is
very rational and it makes sense that if

4076
03:08:36,211 --> 03:08:38,820
you're constantly taking carbohydrates
and you're living off these

4077
03:08:38,821 --> 03:08:42,960
carbohydrates as your main fuel source,
which is what you do when you eat a lot

4078
03:08:42,961 --> 03:08:45,180
of carbohydrates,
this is what's been established when

4079
03:08:45,181 --> 03:08:48,180
your body's in a state of Ketosis,
it's living off of fats,

4080
03:08:48,300 --> 03:08:51,570
you're burning fats,
and you could take exogenous ketones,

4081
03:08:51,810 --> 03:08:54,150
which is that these fucking things,
I pour them into water.

4082
03:08:54,660 --> 03:08:56,490
There's a bunch of different companies
that create these.

4083
03:08:57,270 --> 03:08:58,810
Kido Kana is one that,
uh,

4084
03:08:58,830 --> 03:09:01,650
my friend denny uses it.
I know a lot of athletes that are doing

4085
03:09:01,651 --> 03:09:02,970
this.
Kyle Kingsbury,

4086
03:09:02,971 --> 03:09:04,650
who is a former UFC fighter,
crazy.

4087
03:09:04,651 --> 03:09:06,980
He's really into it.
My friend denny proper coast,

4088
03:09:07,060 --> 03:09:08,460
who's a a,
one of them,

4089
03:09:08,490 --> 03:09:10,320
Eddie Bravo's,
a black belts.

4090
03:09:10,321 --> 03:09:12,840
He runs a 10th planet San Francisco,
good friend of mine.

4091
03:09:12,990 --> 03:09:16,350
He's in a state of Ketosis to make
meeting mostly fats,

4092
03:09:16,590 --> 03:09:19,440
eating oils like coconut oils,
Avocados,

4093
03:09:19,441 --> 03:09:20,310
things along those lines.

4094
03:09:20,430 --> 03:09:23,160
Healthy,
healthy grass fed meats.

4095
03:09:23,161 --> 03:09:25,140
What about like gluten free bread?
Is that okay?

4096
03:09:25,170 --> 03:09:26,850
No,
cause this is all grains.

4097
03:09:26,880 --> 03:09:28,520
Those are carbohydrates.
This is not,

4098
03:09:28,710 --> 03:09:30,510
it's not that it's bad.
What about rice?

4099
03:09:30,511 --> 03:09:32,470
You could exist off rice,
brown rice,

4100
03:09:32,530 --> 03:09:33,450
brown rice,
okay.

4101
03:09:33,510 --> 03:09:35,280
You can be fine,
but you're not listening.

4102
03:09:35,490 --> 03:09:38,520
All right has your carbohydrates.
If you use that as your primary food

4103
03:09:38,550 --> 03:09:40,170
fuel,
you're not going to be in a state of

4104
03:09:40,171 --> 03:09:42,150
ketosis.
It's easy for your body to process

4105
03:09:42,151 --> 03:09:45,000
carbohydrates like this,
but if you're in a state of Ketosis,

4106
03:09:45,001 --> 03:09:47,850
your body's processing fats.
When your body's processing fats,

4107
03:09:47,851 --> 03:09:50,370
here's where it gets really weird in
between meals.

4108
03:09:50,490 --> 03:09:54,010
You don't get a crash.
I don't crash like I was crashing.

4109
03:09:54,160 --> 03:09:55,990
If I had like breakfast.
Okay.

4110
03:09:56,140 --> 03:10:01,140
And if I had breakfast and it was toast
with a potatoes and rice and beans and

4111
03:10:01,830 --> 03:10:02,900
it's all carbs,
right,

4112
03:10:03,020 --> 03:10:03,791
right.
Meeting this,

4113
03:10:03,791 --> 03:10:06,130
this breakfast,
there's gonna come a time,

4114
03:10:06,131 --> 03:10:09,010
a few hours later while I'm fucking
starving,

4115
03:10:09,160 --> 03:10:10,500
dude,
I'm starving.

4116
03:10:10,570 --> 03:10:13,210
I don't get that right now.
I'm not getting that.

4117
03:10:13,630 --> 03:10:17,470
I can go a long time without eating.
Like I eat breakfast and then I'm good

4118
03:10:17,471 --> 03:10:19,900
for hours and hours and hours of
nothing.

4119
03:10:20,110 --> 03:10:21,610
I mean,
I might have a little snack here and

4120
03:10:21,611 --> 03:10:24,070
there,
but I don't absolutely need it like I

4121
03:10:24,071 --> 03:10:24,750
did.
Right.

4122
03:10:24,750 --> 03:10:26,350
I was eating a lot of carbohydrates.
Yeah,

4123
03:10:26,351 --> 03:10:27,240
I get it.
I'm,

4124
03:10:27,241 --> 03:10:28,300
I'm look,
I'm just trying this.

4125
03:10:28,301 --> 03:10:32,200
I might go back after 60 days and say I
like this,

4126
03:10:32,230 --> 03:10:36,400
but I also like to have a certain amount
of carbohydrates in my diet because it

4127
03:10:36,401 --> 03:10:39,220
makes it easier for me to find healthy
foods to eat because I don't think

4128
03:10:39,221 --> 03:10:42,460
there's anything is not,
there's not negative consequences to a

4129
03:10:42,461 --> 03:10:46,840
carbohydrate based diet,
but I think there are some positives to

4130
03:10:46,841 --> 03:10:49,630
consider about being in a state of
ketosis.

4131
03:10:49,690 --> 03:10:51,520
And so I'm trying it.
So that's where I'm at right now,

4132
03:10:51,910 --> 03:10:53,980
but,
but in the discipline,

4133
03:10:54,070 --> 03:10:58,360
in forcing myself to do it,
it makes me think that a lot of what we

4134
03:10:58,361 --> 03:11:02,470
were talking about earlier about not
having control of your impulses and your

4135
03:11:02,471 --> 03:11:05,440
behavior and getting,
giving into video game addiction and

4136
03:11:05,441 --> 03:11:08,650
giving into cell phone addiction on
social media addiction,

4137
03:11:08,651 --> 03:11:12,430
all these things.
I think they're all very related and

4138
03:11:12,431 --> 03:11:14,680
that I think that discipline,
this is a guy that I know,

4139
03:11:14,681 --> 03:11:17,560
his name is Jocko willink and he's a
former navy seal.

4140
03:11:17,740 --> 03:11:19,450
He's got a podcast now.
I talked him into it.

4141
03:11:19,451 --> 03:11:23,440
He's got this great book that he wrote.
I think I have it here somewhere.

4142
03:11:23,510 --> 03:11:24,420
It's actually,
it's actually,

4143
03:11:24,421 --> 03:11:27,110
it's actually out there on the coffee
table owners.

4144
03:11:27,120 --> 03:11:28,240
She extreme ownership.
Thank you.

4145
03:11:28,600 --> 03:11:30,970
Fascinating guy.
He came ownership,

4146
03:11:31,060 --> 03:11:32,980
he's got,
but he's got this one statement that

4147
03:11:32,981 --> 03:11:34,330
discipline equals freedom.

4148
03:11:35,560 --> 03:11:36,910
And I was like,
well,

4149
03:11:36,911 --> 03:11:37,990
okay,
well how do you mean?

4150
03:11:38,020 --> 03:11:39,010
What do you,
what do you mean by that?

4151
03:11:39,011 --> 03:11:41,110
And he explained it to me in very
succinct terms.

4152
03:11:41,650 --> 03:11:43,840
If you have the discipline to get all
the shit done,

4153
03:11:43,870 --> 03:11:46,750
then you can do things you enjoy and
then you're,

4154
03:11:46,751 --> 03:11:49,600
you're not,
you're not compromised by your lack of

4155
03:11:49,601 --> 03:11:51,730
discipline.
You're not trapped by your lack of

4156
03:11:51,731 --> 03:11:55,030
discipline.
When you're emerging from a fucking 16

4157
03:11:55,031 --> 03:11:57,490
hour binge of playing video games,
you're stepping outside.

4158
03:11:57,491 --> 03:12:00,040
It's 9:00 AM and your eyes are
bloodshot.

4159
03:12:00,041 --> 03:12:03,010
You feel like a fucking prisoner and
your Dick is rock.

4160
03:12:03,011 --> 03:12:04,690
He's been beaten off the last 45
minutes.

4161
03:12:05,150 --> 03:12:08,630
Did you fuck your prisoner?
You're a prisoner to your indulgences.

4162
03:12:08,980 --> 03:12:11,410
The same thing I think can be said with
your diet.

4163
03:12:11,590 --> 03:12:15,430
The same thing can be said with
indulging the idea of you always being

4164
03:12:15,431 --> 03:12:16,690
in a state of being overweight.

4165
03:12:16,870 --> 03:12:19,840
The same thing can be said with a
million other things that people do that

4166
03:12:19,841 --> 03:12:22,480
they never follow through on.
I always wanted to be a singer.

4167
03:12:22,600 --> 03:12:25,630
I never had the balls to pursue it.
I always wanted to be a painter,

4168
03:12:25,720 --> 03:12:29,110
but I never had the time to paint after
my fucking job because I'm working over

4169
03:12:29,250 --> 03:12:31,140
because I just bought a new car.
But a little,

4170
03:12:31,141 --> 03:12:31,661
a little,
a little,

4171
03:12:31,661 --> 03:12:32,494
uh,
it's,

4172
03:12:32,830 --> 03:12:35,680
there's,
there's traps that we will set for

4173
03:12:35,681 --> 03:12:37,030
ourselves,
but if you,

4174
03:12:37,060 --> 03:12:41,500
if you give yourself a healthy trap,
you give yourself like a healthy

4175
03:12:41,501 --> 03:12:43,500
protocol,
a healthy directive,

4176
03:12:43,540 --> 03:12:45,880
a healthy pattern that you have to
follow,

4177
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:50,800
you find some peace in that.
And the thing about this fucking wacky

4178
03:12:50,810 --> 03:12:55,640
diet is,
the thing that's most shocking to me is

4179
03:12:55,641 --> 03:13:00,641
that I'm not any less happy than I'd be
if I was eating ice cream or stuff and

4180
03:13:00,801 --> 03:13:04,100
pizza down my fat phase are letting my
book and cheeks blow,

4181
03:13:04,140 --> 03:13:06,650
but
I'm not,

4182
03:13:06,651 --> 03:13:08,870
I'm not any less happy,
I'm happy,

4183
03:13:09,130 --> 03:13:09,950
I'm very happy.

4184
03:13:09,950 --> 03:13:13,690
I'm more happy because I have energy.
So even if it's not a car bay

4185
03:13:13,970 --> 03:13:15,650
carbohydrate thing,
even if it's just a,

4186
03:13:15,920 --> 03:13:18,290
I've eliminated sugars,
even if it's,

4187
03:13:18,291 --> 03:13:22,700
I've just allowed myself my body to take
a break off the fucking insulin spike,

4188
03:13:22,950 --> 03:13:25,010
right?
Eating a giant bowl of pasta,

4189
03:13:25,040 --> 03:13:27,800
even if it's just that,
whatever the fuck it is,

4190
03:13:28,130 --> 03:13:30,560
it's working and I think they're
connected.

4191
03:13:30,770 --> 03:13:34,100
I think it's connected to me forcing
myself to get regular exercise.

4192
03:13:34,280 --> 03:13:36,410
I don't allow myself to not get
exercise.

4193
03:13:36,650 --> 03:13:39,170
It's not in there.
I don't allow it because I've done it

4194
03:13:39,171 --> 03:13:40,340
before.
I don't like it.

4195
03:13:40,490 --> 03:13:41,900
Right.
So I don't allow it.

4196
03:13:41,960 --> 03:13:44,300
And in not allowing it,
it's never an option.

4197
03:13:44,510 --> 03:13:47,450
So if I,
if my alarm is set and I get up and it's

4198
03:13:47,451 --> 03:13:48,360
what's Today,
oh,

4199
03:13:48,760 --> 03:13:50,900
today is death sprints on the elliptical
machine.

4200
03:13:50,901 --> 03:13:52,470
Well that's what I have to fucking do.
Right?

4201
03:13:52,520 --> 03:13:53,690
We just do it.
Cause I don't,

4202
03:13:53,750 --> 03:13:56,120
I can't do everything and unless I do
everything,

4203
03:13:56,240 --> 03:13:58,340
unless I follow all the shit that I have
on my list,

4204
03:13:58,580 --> 03:14:01,070
I'm not going to be able to go fuck off
and,

4205
03:14:01,071 --> 03:14:03,050
and,
and enjoy a television show.

4206
03:14:03,190 --> 03:14:05,360
I'm not going to be,
I'm not going to appreciate those things

4207
03:14:05,540 --> 03:14:09,500
because I've forced myself to get the
shit done that I need to get done.

4208
03:14:09,650 --> 03:14:13,670
And I forced myself to follow this weird
pattern.

4209
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:16,940
Discipline.
You could do the same thing.

4210
03:14:17,750 --> 03:14:18,590
Oh yeah,
man.

4211
03:14:18,591 --> 03:14:21,080
I mean I know I could do about it could.
Yeah,

4212
03:14:21,110 --> 03:14:22,310
it's cool.
Well it's a,

4213
03:14:22,311 --> 03:14:24,430
it's a beautiful idea.
I mean it really is like the,

4214
03:14:24,440 --> 03:14:27,350
I think there is something like very
exciting about it.

4215
03:14:27,351 --> 03:14:31,880
Anytime I've pulled off even the most
mild discipline in my life,

4216
03:14:32,390 --> 03:14:37,280
the end result is like incredible.
Have you been raving about how good you

4217
03:14:37,281 --> 03:14:40,220
felt once you started working out with a
trainer for a couple of months?

4218
03:14:40,330 --> 03:14:42,050
But I read the exact thing you were
saying.

4219
03:14:42,051 --> 03:14:45,380
I fucking hurt myself doing dead lifts
and then,

4220
03:14:45,470 --> 03:14:48,170
uh,
because of that injury I stopped working

4221
03:14:48,171 --> 03:14:52,490
out and then because of that I use that
as an excuse and then I started like,

4222
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:54,950
I just fell off the wagon again.
You should,

4223
03:14:54,980 --> 03:14:57,320
you should do something that's a
practice,

4224
03:14:57,750 --> 03:14:58,640
that sort of thing.
No,

4225
03:14:58,641 --> 03:15:00,020
your,
whether it's a martial art,

4226
03:15:00,230 --> 03:15:01,820
which you tried a little bit in the
past,

4227
03:15:01,940 --> 03:15:06,200
but I think the best one for you at this
point is probably yoga because I think

4228
03:15:06,201 --> 03:15:08,150
yoga fits right into your sensibilities.

4229
03:15:08,180 --> 03:15:08,930
Yeah,
that's cool.

4230
03:15:08,930 --> 03:15:12,260
So instead of like having some guy who
comes over and makes you jump on a box

4231
03:15:12,261 --> 03:15:14,570
and skip rope,
go to a fucking yoga class,

4232
03:15:14,571 --> 03:15:16,040
man.
Well,

4233
03:15:16,041 --> 03:15:16,880
no,
this guy,

4234
03:15:16,920 --> 03:15:20,840
the guy I work with at Equinox,
George Chen,

4235
03:15:20,900 --> 03:15:23,760
the best,
he's fucking really cool mashery until

4236
03:15:23,830 --> 03:15:25,430
like,
there's something in that.

4237
03:15:25,550 --> 03:15:28,400
But I'm not going to do that forever.
I can't afford a trainer forever.

4238
03:15:28,401 --> 03:15:29,800
But what do you,
what do you listen more?

4239
03:15:29,860 --> 03:15:30,960
More crazy talk.
What?

4240
03:15:30,961 --> 03:15:32,360
What?
He's going to start not being

4241
03:15:32,361 --> 03:15:34,610
successful.
I want to start failing at comedy.

4242
03:15:34,640 --> 03:15:36,350
I don't mean that.
I mean I don't want to like,

4243
03:15:36,410 --> 03:15:37,880
I just don't want to have a trainer
forever.

4244
03:15:37,881 --> 03:15:39,760
I don't want to have a trainer.
Yeah,

4245
03:15:39,800 --> 03:15:42,650
so this is great man.
This is an awesome therapy.

4246
03:15:42,651 --> 03:15:45,680
Like you're,
it's really cool now your identify like

4247
03:15:45,681 --> 03:15:48,080
it's cool.
You're being like very strict on the way

4248
03:15:48,081 --> 03:15:49,560
I'm talking like to myself.

4249
03:15:49,590 --> 03:15:50,280
No,
I just,

4250
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:53,360
I just know you write real good,
right?

4251
03:15:53,390 --> 03:15:55,100
We've been friends for a long time.
It's true.

4252
03:15:55,230 --> 03:15:57,930
And this is this one thing where you'll
come in and come out of,

4253
03:15:57,990 --> 03:15:59,310
right.
It's like a trance.

4254
03:15:59,610 --> 03:16:00,750
When you,
when you're in a trance,

4255
03:16:00,751 --> 03:16:02,820
I almost forgot to grab your shoulders,
wake up.

4256
03:16:03,840 --> 03:16:05,970
But you'll come out of that trance guns
blazing.

4257
03:16:05,971 --> 03:16:06,571
Like,
dude,

4258
03:16:06,571 --> 03:16:08,880
I had a fucking sound and I ran four
miles.

4259
03:16:10,190 --> 03:16:11,890
It's the best you come out of that
training,

4260
03:16:12,890 --> 03:16:15,340
but then you'll slide,
you'll slow.

4261
03:16:15,570 --> 03:16:18,090
Why?
I like having a trainer because he

4262
03:16:18,091 --> 03:16:23,091
forces you to like really work hard,
like way harder than normally.

4263
03:16:24,121 --> 03:16:28,650
I forced myself to work out like a
trainer makes you feel like you're like

4264
03:16:28,710 --> 03:16:33,710
passing out from in its crate and I end
the feeling after working out hard like

4265
03:16:34,351 --> 03:16:35,960
that,
there's nothing like it.

4266
03:16:36,130 --> 03:16:40,260
I don't know anything like it better
than almost anything that I could think

4267
03:16:40,261 --> 03:16:40,440
of.

4268
03:16:40,440 --> 03:16:43,620
It's the most incredible thing,
but you have to do it regularly,

4269
03:16:43,621 --> 03:16:45,660
you know?
And also the Diet.

4270
03:16:45,661 --> 03:16:46,620
It's all diet.
For me,

4271
03:16:46,630 --> 03:16:50,100
my,
my real problem is just eating like shit

4272
03:16:50,101 --> 03:16:52,020
at night.
It's sucks.

4273
03:16:52,050 --> 03:16:56,220
Just eat healthy at night.
Just [inaudible] just pull yourself and

4274
03:16:56,221 --> 03:17:00,780
I swear you can do this.
Put yourself on a super strict diet for

4275
03:17:00,781 --> 03:17:03,420
20 days.
Just make it 20 days.

4276
03:17:03,510 --> 03:17:08,130
Just write down 20 days for 20 days.
I'm not eating any bullshit and make

4277
03:17:08,131 --> 03:17:10,380
them write down what you can and can't
eat or you know,

4278
03:17:10,390 --> 03:17:12,660
maybe you can talk to a nutritionist
that's not hard to do.

4279
03:17:12,750 --> 03:17:14,520
Say,
I want to do this for my podcast.

4280
03:17:14,521 --> 03:17:17,340
I'm going to document it for 20 days.
I'm going to eat real healthy.

4281
03:17:17,380 --> 03:17:19,230
Yes.
Part of the reason why I said I was

4282
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:22,320
going to do it for 60 days cause I,
I wanted to say it on the air.

4283
03:17:22,350 --> 03:17:24,960
I wanted to say it as annoying as it
might be to hear me talk about it all

4284
03:17:24,961 --> 03:17:28,500
the time.
I'm saying it because I want to be

4285
03:17:28,501 --> 03:17:29,610
committed to it.
That's cool.

4286
03:17:29,611 --> 03:17:30,300
I don't want to like,
Hey,

4287
03:17:30,300 --> 03:17:31,750
I don't want to say I'm just eating real
clean.

4288
03:17:31,751 --> 03:17:32,910
That's a smart way to do it.
You know,

4289
03:17:32,960 --> 03:17:36,330
I forced herself,
I had a whole scheme when I started

4290
03:17:36,331 --> 03:17:39,840
working at this last time that I was
going to get in really good shape and

4291
03:17:39,841 --> 03:17:43,020
then talk about how I did it.
So I kept it a secret.

4292
03:17:43,260 --> 03:17:44,910
So like I was like,
man,

4293
03:17:44,970 --> 03:17:46,920
I was working out.
I started with Justin.

4294
03:17:47,190 --> 03:17:48,900
I was working so fucking hard,
man.

4295
03:17:48,930 --> 03:17:53,730
I really was like harder than I'd ever
done and then I just blew it and it

4296
03:17:53,731 --> 03:17:55,230
sucks.
It happens,

4297
03:17:55,231 --> 03:17:56,400
man.
Sucks.

4298
03:17:56,401 --> 03:17:59,370
It's a constant battle that most people
have.

4299
03:17:59,371 --> 03:18:01,290
It's a constant trap that most people
have.

4300
03:18:01,290 --> 03:18:05,070
It's super fucking common.
It's one of the most common things that

4301
03:18:05,071 --> 03:18:07,590
people fall back to where it's shitty
foods.

4302
03:18:07,620 --> 03:18:11,010
I love the year I will take into account
what you've said.

4303
03:18:11,250 --> 03:18:11,941
Honestly,
man,

4304
03:18:11,941 --> 03:18:14,490
I'd like to continue to be super
personal.

4305
03:18:14,760 --> 03:18:19,390
The idea right now,
when I think to just do 20 days of like

4306
03:18:19,440 --> 03:18:22,140
eating healthy,
when I think about that,

4307
03:18:22,230 --> 03:18:25,830
I feel like this combination of like
boredom and despair,

4308
03:18:29,390 --> 03:18:31,890
it's like,
but you can still eat delicious food,

4309
03:18:31,920 --> 03:18:34,020
right?
That's where it's so confusing.

4310
03:18:34,170 --> 03:18:36,450
You just don't drink fruit juice.
Okay.

4311
03:18:36,451 --> 03:18:38,310
You get fruit juice.
You're drinking sugar water.

4312
03:18:38,311 --> 03:18:40,440
What an hour and even orange juice.
No,

4313
03:18:40,441 --> 03:18:43,170
you're not supposed to eat an orange,
right?

4314
03:18:43,200 --> 03:18:46,110
Don't drink that shit.
This is not normal.

4315
03:18:46,330 --> 03:18:47,980
We figured some stupid way to

4316
03:18:47,980 --> 03:18:50,890
hijack our reward systems and jolted
with sugar,

4317
03:18:50,920 --> 03:18:51,251
blah,
blah,

4318
03:18:51,251 --> 03:18:53,350
blah.
Now I've got my own Jay.

4319
03:18:53,530 --> 03:18:56,160
I'm drinking old.
You chicken fucking sugar.

4320
03:18:56,590 --> 03:18:59,080
I mean it's better than soda because
there's vitamin C in it,

4321
03:18:59,100 --> 03:19:02,110
but coconut water,
some of it is okay,

4322
03:19:02,350 --> 03:19:05,860
but if you drink too much of it,
it's probably sweet,

4323
03:19:06,280 --> 03:19:07,630
right?
If it's sweet,

4324
03:19:07,631 --> 03:19:11,020
there's some sugars in it.
You're supposed to eat the whole thing.

4325
03:19:11,290 --> 03:19:13,870
It's supposed to all be together.
You have an orange.

4326
03:19:13,871 --> 03:19:15,490
It's what?
This is a fiber in that thing.

4327
03:19:15,491 --> 03:19:16,480
You're supposed to,
it's all,

4328
03:19:16,481 --> 03:19:19,540
it's supposed to be a part of that.
When you eat an apple,

4329
03:19:19,570 --> 03:19:22,610
that's how supposed to get apple juice.
Supposed to get it from the fucking not

4330
03:19:22,611 --> 03:19:25,350
supposed to get a quarter of that shit
and throw it into your fat horse.

4331
03:19:25,510 --> 03:19:27,100
This reminds me,
there's a great show.

4332
03:19:27,101 --> 03:19:29,250
I don't know how much time we have,
but there's a,

4333
03:19:29,350 --> 03:19:33,490
there's a great show called from fit to
fat to fit.

4334
03:19:33,520 --> 03:19:35,590
Yeah,
I've heard about it that make trainers

4335
03:19:35,591 --> 03:19:37,090
get fat.
It's bad ass.

4336
03:19:37,120 --> 03:19:37,953
Um,
there it is.

4337
03:19:38,200 --> 03:19:39,610
Yeah.
This is really cool man.

4338
03:19:39,611 --> 03:19:42,340
And it's like the trainers,
when they talk about what it's like to

4339
03:19:42,341 --> 03:19:45,700
get fat like that,
how their personalities change.

4340
03:19:45,850 --> 03:19:48,490
Like they really throw themselves in the
hole and it's like,

4341
03:19:48,640 --> 03:19:52,150
it's amazing.
The psychological component of it.

4342
03:19:53,240 --> 03:19:56,140
It's really,
you should watch it on 70 pounds on

4343
03:19:56,141 --> 03:19:58,690
8,000 calorie a day diet.
Donna's hill,

4344
03:19:58,691 --> 03:20:01,620
personal trainer,
gorgeous on donuts and Mcdonald's every

4345
03:20:01,620 --> 03:20:02,320
day.
Man.

4346
03:20:02,320 --> 03:20:03,760
That is that.
As these guys are bad,

4347
03:20:03,790 --> 03:20:04,601
these are heroes,
man,

4348
03:20:04,601 --> 03:20:08,650
because they get themselves really sick
for these people and then they climb out

4349
03:20:08,651 --> 03:20:10,840
of the hole.
Well good for them because they are

4350
03:20:10,841 --> 03:20:13,280
doing it consciously in the understand
what,

4351
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:17,370
what the whole purpose of this thing is
versus like someone who just,

4352
03:20:17,720 --> 03:20:19,960
you know,
tanks and then you have to hear about

4353
03:20:19,961 --> 03:20:21,760
them pulling themselves back from the
brink.

4354
03:20:22,090 --> 03:20:23,350
You know?
Can I am,

4355
03:20:23,410 --> 03:20:25,330
can I pitch these pitch picture fucking
friends?

4356
03:20:25,331 --> 03:20:29,020
I have to announce him dates.
I'm going to be the Denver comedy works

4357

4362
03:20:45,011 --> 03:20:48,370

I'm doing podcasts there and I hope you

4363
03:20:48,371 --> 03:20:49,240
will come.
Oh,

the world.

4365

Thanks dude.
