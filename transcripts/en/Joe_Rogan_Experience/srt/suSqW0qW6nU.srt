1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,660
I think that would pan out.
I had a similar idea.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,030
Anthony Kumina were alive,
sir.

3
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,950
I love it.
Joe Rogan.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,960
If it was not for you,
oh my God,

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,550
this,
this would not exist.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,880
Which is insane.
That is 100 percent actual fact.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,360
I was watching you doing live from the 
compound.

8
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:22,194
Me and Brian Red Band.
We're sitting in my fucking living room 

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,630
and we were watching you while you were 
fucking playing karaoke.

10
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:30,510
You're singing karaoke with a machine 
gun in front of a green screen.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,340
I was like,
this guy,

12
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,174
this guy just set up his own studio like
he already has opie and Anthony show at 

13
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:38,694
the time.
You guys were at Sirius Xm and he just 

14
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:43,560
decided to do this thing in your 
basement just for a goof.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,760
Yeah,
it was like a hobby,

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,490
but it's like guys who don't have kids,
married,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,170
not married,
don't have kids,

18
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:51,510
so I don't have anybody telling them 
what to do and they also have disposable

19
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,140
income.

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,940
Then you get to see what guys really 
want to do.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,720
They want to sing karaoke with a machine
gun in front of a green screen.

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,860
Yeah.
It was crazy,

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,280
crazy gun Guy Karaoke,
so I could do that.

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,303
If if I was married,
I would have a wife that would lose her 

25
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:06,924
mind at my living room,
my living room table that you're 

26
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:14,121
supposed to have a candle on and little 
chotchkies and stuff is a wide screen,

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,030
a computer monitor and a gaming system 
right next to the table.

28
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,470
I have a gaming computer that's just 
unbelievable.

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,240
And I sit there and just play video 
games.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,000
So the table itself is a gaming monitor?
Yeah.

31
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:27,834
The whole tape.
Well it is one of those touch screen 

32
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:30,240
ones.
No,

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,520
it's a,
it's a giant wide monitor.

34
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:35,040
It's like a,
like 40 inches wide.

35
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,710
So that's the table.
No,

36
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:37,544
it's on the table.

37
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,440
The table's big heavy metal thing,
but.

38
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,663
But it's just everything.
There's vr goggles up on the console by 

39
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,204
the TV.
It's just sensors around the room for 

40
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:48,294
the VR.
It's a playground and you're absolutely 

41
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,624
right.
Guys will spend their money on having 

42
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,250
fun if,
if allowed to.

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,370
That's what this place,
this place is insane in my house.

44
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,750
You go to my house,
it's my wife's house.

45
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:03,840
Say That's how it works.
Have one elk head on the wall.

46
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,970
That's all I have.
That's all you're allowed.

47
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,620
I laugh at guys when they have the,
uh,

48
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:08,970
the man cave,
like,

49
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:10,190
dude,
come on down to the man cave.

50
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:12,090
The chicks aren't allowed down here.
I got this,

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,770
the TV that.
And I'm like,

52
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,220
no,
you should replace is the whole house.

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,810
She relegated you to one room echo and 
you're happy about it.

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,240
You're happy that you got one room.

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,830
Happy wife.
Happy life.

56
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:30,260
That's apparently it didn't work.
It didn't work for me.

57
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,930
You know the thoreau quote that I say 
way too many times in this podcast,

58
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:34,764
but I love the quote.
Most men live lives of silent 

59
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,460
desperation.
Wow.

60
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,350
Yeah,
that is true.

61
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,540
It's a hundred percent true.
It was,

62
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,700
uh,
I was married for time and it was a,

63
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,610
it was a nightmare.
It was a living hell for me.

64
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,790
The only thing that got me through as 
many years as I was married,

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,833
because I was married nine years and I 
don't remember one happy year out of 

66
00:02:56,881 --> 00:03:00,400
those nine,
but I had gotten into radio pretty early

67
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,270
on in that marriage.
Um,

68
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,603
and that was my life.
So I dedicated myself no matter how 

69
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,210
miserable anything else in my life was.
I was doing radio.

70
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,070
So I,
I thought it was awesome.

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,270
I have a theory about that.

72
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,313
I really do.
I think that a person needs a certain 

73
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:20,980
amount of suffering in their life.
And if you look at some of the all time,

74
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:24,640
great comics or even all time great 
radio personalities like Howard Stern,

75
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,940
Howard Stern,
during his hay day when he was,

76
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,960
the fucking man was miserable.
Right?

77
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,650
Right.
He would talk about it.

78
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,330
He would hide in his basement.
I love those stories.

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,810
Here's this guy.
He's the,

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,420
you know,
the biggest radio personality ever.

81
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,010
He's,
he's huge.

82
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,963
And yet he's got to hide and he's just 
talking about masturbating and hiding 

83
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,970
from his wife and he can't get any sex.
And you're like,

84
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:52,060
it didn't matter if he was huge,
didn't matter if he was famous,

85
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,010
didn't matter how rich he was,
didn't matter.

86
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,293
He's just hide in the basement.
And that anger came out on the radio 

87
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,980
like you related to him.
You understood it.

88
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

89
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,840
I,
I,

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,620
I get that.
Um,

91
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,000
and it worked for me because there was a
lot of misery.

92
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,313
Like when I started doing really well,
we moved back to New York from Boston 

93
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,780
after we got fired.
Oh,

94
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,633
opiod myself.
You guys got fired for saying that the 

95
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:17,230
mayor died?
Yeah,

96
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,103
it was an April fool's gag and a.
because we always thought that the 

97
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,923
radio,
April fool's jokes was so stupid and 

98
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,710
Hokey and uh,
yeah,

99
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,743
we changed the format to all elvis and 
it's like after 10 minutes they say 

100
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:33,670
April fools.
So we're like,

101
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:37,780
let's just go balls out and say the 
mayor's dead and have a news guy come on

102
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:41,440
and report it and everything.
And then it was supposed to subsequently

103
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:44,290
get more outrageous as the,
uh,

104
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,550
the,
the show went on.

105
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,563
So by the end of it,
there was a Taiwan male hooker in the 

106
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,530
car with them and they crashed because 
he was getting a blow job or so,

107
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,600
like it was going to get really 
ridiculous,

108
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,310
but they stopped it early on and never 
allowed us to even mention it.

109
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,490
So people really thought he died.
Although it's kind of stupid.

110
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,324
You go to the one show for your news,
but back then the internet wasn't what 

111
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,330
it is now.
Exactly.

112
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:11,130
Yeah.
It was the inner,

113
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,810
the inner wasn't even,
it was barely a thing.

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,310
It was barely a thing.
Uh,

115
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,460
because that was 90,
97 around there.

116
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,950
Ninety eight.
What year did you get on?

117
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:24,430
You'll probably earlier I was on really 
early,

118
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:27,800
like the eighties.
I was on bulletin board service.

119
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,653
Uh,
and uh,

120
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,513
we used to play Trivia Games with a 300 
Baud Modem with people and I thought it 

121
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,790
was amazing even then.
And then in,

122
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,680
in the,
uh,

123
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,583
when we were up in Boston,
I bought a digital camera that was just 

124
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,860
this giant thing.
And I had a laptop and other giant thing

125
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,903
and I would take pictures of what was 
going on in the studio and then post 

126
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:49,744
them that night on a website that I 
figured out I used to code the html 

127
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,163
myself and make a website,
just post pictures and links and people 

128
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:00,350
thought it was amazing.

129
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,290
Like you're seeing what we talked about 
that day.

130
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,060
Uh,
it wasn't instant,

131
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:07,670
but it was pretty cool.
And then I started doing videos.

132
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,863
I was able to put video like maybe eight
second clips of nude girls if they were 

133
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:15,860
in the studio and pop that up and people
loved it.

134
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,943
Uh,
and then I got a bill from the company 

135
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,440
for bandwidth and I didn't know 
bandwidth.

136
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,500
It was a $12,000
bill for a month.

137
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah.
Yeah,

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,110
because I,
there was no,

139
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,093
there was no compression or anything.
I'm pumping video out to thousands of 

140
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,430
people uncompressed.
And uh,

141
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,120
apparently they had that happen a couple
of times.

142
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:42,980
So they told me just don't do it again.
They didn't make me pay,

143
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:46,150
which was pretty cool.
But at that point I had to learn about,

144
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:49,610
you know,
coding and a compression and things like

145
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,444
that.
So you just kept doing it and just put 

146
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,380
them in some sort of a compressed 
format.

147
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,690
Did you,
uh,

148
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,050
would you use,
do you remember back then?

149
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh God,
I think it was like a for audio.

150
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:02,090
It was real audio,
which was hilarious.

151
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,380
Right.
The little player,

152
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,020
real,
real audio player would pop up.

153
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,870
And then for video got,
I can't even remember what it was,

154
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,030
but it was terrible.
It was all pixilated,

155
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,550
you know,
like 10 frames per minute,

156
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,940
kind of weird things like real audio,
which was everywhere.

157
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,490
They just quit,
gave up around still unless they changed

158
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:23,920
into something else,
you know,

159
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,910
or kind kinda got bought out by 
somebody.

160
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,103
Yeah,
yeah,

161
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,610
yeah.
That's happens to everything.

162
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,120
But honestly,
if it was not for you and your show live

163
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:33,830
from the competent and for,
for opiod.

164
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:34,664
Hilarious.
Because opie and Anthony was the first 

165
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,764
radio show that I re what are wherever 
realize you don't really have to have a 

166
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:40,574
format.

167
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,080
Yeah.
You can just talk.

168
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,910
Yeah.
It was just kind of a,

169
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,560
a talk thing.
There was a hang,

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,510
it was a hang and a lot of the uh,
we,

171
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,240
we were on the same.
It was the same company as Howard Stern,

172
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:52,520
CBS radio.
Oh,

173
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:53,354
look at that real still here.
It says it makes stories from your 

174
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:59,210
videos and photos now.
But this is exactly what it is.

175
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,740
It's real.
It's a real player.

176
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,640
Automatically makes videos.
Stories from your best photos.

177
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,990
Sorry,
cut you off there.

178
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,430
I know.
It's like a kind of montage automatic to

179
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:12,980
for the.
Yeah.

180
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,230
Yeah.
Used to be a good way to watch porn with

181
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:19,850
Weird Codex Codex when porn had a weird 
codex,

182
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,630
you know,
like woo.

183
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,290
Fucking who compiled this?
You'd get it.

184
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,740
You'd watch it on real player.
Get porn from bit torrent.

185
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:28,611
Yeah.
Yeah.

186
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:32,150
And then sometimes you wouldn't have 
anything on your computer to play.

187
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,850
It was say a Codec not available.
Yeah,

188
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,743
exactly.
Pissed off because he liked to find 

189
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,880
they'll fuck.
Yeah.

190
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,410
No,
that thumbnail was awesome.

191
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:42,244
I got to see.
I remember the first time I ever got a 

192
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:46,850
porn video sent to me.
I was like,

193
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,440
this is crazy.
Yeah.

194
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,450
Yeah.
Watch a porn video.

195
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,850
Before it was just photos,
the photos were insane because,

196
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:57,330
uh,
I guess it was around the mid nineties.

197
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,190
My brother had picked up a,
uh,

198
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,533
an apple computer.
I don't even know what model it was or 

199
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,020
anything,
but it was,

200
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,430
uh,
it was pretty good for the time.

201
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,653
And uh,
I just sat in front of that thing for 

202
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,930
hours and hours on end.
Just one porn pick.

203
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,480
It was no videos,
just pictures and you know,

204
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:19,170
how they used to scroll sometimes it was
a corrupt file,

205
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:23,910
so halfway down it would just turn white
and pixelated and zigzaggy.

206
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,770
But uh,
just for hours,

207
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:27,420
just one more,
one more,

208
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,690
one more and just go tick,
tick,

209
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,573
tick,
tick,

210
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,440
tick.
It would slowly emerged.

211
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,350
It was very,
a very compelling.

212
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah.
You'd sit there and just waiting for the

213
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,300
three d printer is faster now than it 
was downloading photos on a 14 k modem.

214
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,803
Yeah.
Yeah.

215
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,653
It's insane to think of the technology 
end of it because you got thumb drives 

216
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:54,000
with more memory than entire computers 
had just a few years ago.

217
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,221
Uh,
and,

218
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:58,260
and I remember,
I guess it was Bill Gates or something,

219
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:01,020
said you'll,
you'll never need anything more powerful

220
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:03,630
than a for 86 years ago.
And it's like,

221
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,250
what,
a couple of megs of memory and uh,

222
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,870
just crazy the,
the demand for,

223
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,733
for a computer power got way out of hand
and especially with games and stuff 

224
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:18,300
because I'm a huge gaming got now you 
download a game,

225
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,134
like a red dead redemption,
two or call of duty and it's 75 to 100 

226
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,150
gigs.

227
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,230
Really.
Those games.

228
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:29,340
Yeah.
And it's like,

229
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,890
that would,
that would have been 100 computers.

230
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,790
And to think of those floppy discs you 
used to get games on,

231
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,953
it would have been a pallet stacked up 
like six feet high of those discs to 

232
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:43,800
load it on a computer.
So I'm like the old doom games.

233
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,391
Yeah,
yeah,

234
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:45,090
yeah.
With the.

235
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,630
Yeah.
You just make those sounds and hopefully

236
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,220
it would work.
And uh,

237
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,630
yeah.
Now you just download them.

238
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:56,631
I haven't been to a gaming store in 
years because with the origin or steam,

239
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,220
you just download the game right off of 
your,

240
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,063
uh,
offline redemption to you just download 

241
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:04,110
it.
You just download it.

242
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,973
Like,
I don't know who goes to gamestop or 

243
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:06,900
anything anymore.

244
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,430
I mean there's one in the mall I've 
seen.

245
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,440
Yeah,
I've seen it.

246
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,300
I don't know.
Maybe if we used games.

247
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,970
Yeah.
Xbox and playstation.

248
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,810
Xbox you could download to,
right?

249
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,521
Oh yeah,
yeah,

250
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:19,680
yeah.
And playstation.

251
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,110
Yeah.
You just plugged the cat six or whatever

252
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:23,944
it was.
And was having a conversation with 

253
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:26,410
Jordan Peterson about this yesterday off
air.

254
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:27,244
I was saying I'm really,
I get concerned because I feel like all 

255
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:31,714
of our information,
like the vast majority of it is now 

256
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:38,230
digital and we have some things that are
written down on paper,

257
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:42,430
but even paper so it's so easy to break 
and burn and fuck up.

258
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:43,264
I mean,
we lost most of human beings loss most 

259
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:49,120
of the information about Egypt when they
burned the library of Alexandria,

260
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,690
who knows?
I mean,

261
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,190
there could have been all sorts of 
schematics and some diagrams,

262
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,023
detailed diagrams,
how they built some of the things they 

263
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,250
built,
lost it all,

264
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,900
you know,
that easily could happen to us.

265
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,640
And then we'll be starting from scratch 
again.

266
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,561
Yeah.
The,

267
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:03,120
uh,
when,

268
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,270
when it takes some form of electricity 
to,

269
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,520
to get to all this information,
you're really dependent on that.

270
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:15,060
There's going to be power,
that type of power of forever.

271
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,023
And even if we figured out how to reboot
electricity and say some day in the 

272
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,204
future,
what if we have a massive coronal mass 

273
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,190
ejection and it fucking nukes the 
entire,

274
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,840
the whole grid and all the satellites go
down and we have to start from scratch.

275
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:29,674
So it's a decade,
two decades before people start 

276
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,870
rebuilding computers again.
That actually work well.

277
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:37,600
They're going to have to decipher all 
this information.

278
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,220
They're going to have to figure out 
those codex.

279
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,680
They're going to have to figure out,
yeah,

280
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,480
they're going to get drivers to make all
this stuff work.

281
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,920
And you're gonna miss a lot of it.

282
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,020
Yeah.
All the info is literally ones and Zeros

283
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,750
and it has to be decoded and put back 
together again

284
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,420
and some important stuff.
If it's on a drive somewhere,

285
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:55,980
it could just get nuked.
Yeah,

286
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,050
it's gone.
It's gone forever.

287
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:00,420
All the things that people figured out 
gone.

288
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,770
Don't you wish that would happen at 
some?

289
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,800
I don't know.
I'm so cynical,

290
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:09,650
man.
I really have lately more so.

291
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,573
I,
I think over the course of the past few 

292
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,680
years I've just gotten more cynical and 
uh,

293
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,620
I think social media had a big effect on
me.

294
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,870
Well,
you engaged too much.

295
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,220
Yes,
I did.

296
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,020
I'm off social media now.
I have been for,

297
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,660
for maybe months at least,
you know,

298
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,510
as a personal choice.
Well,

299
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,280
the twitter kicked me off quite a few 
times,

300
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,150
but they kick you off just dumb shit to.
It wasn't even.

301
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,110
It wasn't even that bad.
Like wow.

302
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,280
The last one,
it was a,

303
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,114
I was defending Jimmy Norton.
Some girl was on just bashing Jimmy and 

304
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:49,070
uh,
and I was like,

305
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,960
look at you.
I go,

306
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,270
I don't even know what you are.
First of all,

307
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,420
you're either a masculine girl or a 
feminine guy and your hair looks like it

308
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:01,750
was dyed with period blood because she 
has to,

309
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,170
and both at God they fucking permanently
suspended me.

310
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,370
That was the back.
Was it bloods period.

311
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,120
Blood.
You can't make fun of that.

312
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:14,420
You can't make fun of somebody says 
looks if the sexuality.

313
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,410
I kind of called him a a fam,
uh,

314
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,680
or,
or a butch,

315
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,810
whatever.
It was never whichever case,

316
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:21,644
whichever case.
And to this day I still don't know 

317
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,210
actually,
but uh,

318
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,300
so I get kicked off a lot.
I have a twitter account now,

319
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,493
but I have not told anybody what the 
name is because I just use it for 

320
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:38,930
research for the show because a twitter 
gets the news before the news.

321
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,420
Like that's where everything breaks now 
on twitter.

322
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,340
You know what's interesting to me,
Louis?

323
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,540
Fair.
Still twitter.

324
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,280
It,
it's,

325
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,520
it's amazing.
You have a read.

326
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,400
Some of the Shitty says evil Jews.
Crazy.

327
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:53,030
Antisemetic believable,
unbelievable.

328
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,070
And for whatever reason they're scared 
to kicking him off.

329
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,750
Yeah,
they won't kick him off.

330
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,750
I guess a Laura loomer is a Jewish kind 
of independent reporter girl,

331
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,770
and a nutcase slash nutcase,
whatever.

332
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,320
Yeah,
yeah,

333
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,153
yeah.
Whatever you want to change or 

334
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,390
something.
She changed herself to twitter.

335
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,730
Yes.
Hilarious.

336
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,723
I just watched it on periscope as it was
going on and she's got a bull horn and 

337
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:16,050
she's just yelling,
uh,

338
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,380
at twitter as a bull horn,
you know,

339
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,513
it's funny.
It's kind of left wing tactics she was 

340
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:29,270
using because conservatives,
the right Republicans,

341
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,104
whatever you want to call are pretty 
mellow when it comes to they don't 

342
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,223
demonstrate really.
They like to just get in there and do 

343
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:37,430
their shit,
whatever it is.

344
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,743
Uh,
but liberals really like getting out 

345
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:44,000
there and marching and yelling and bull 
horns and stuff like that.

346
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:47,150
So it was weird,
like to see that on the other end.

347
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,650
Uh,
but she,

348
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,633
she just screaming and uh,
I guess I guess they unhooked her and 

349
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:55,190
uh,
and arrested ourselves.

350
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,883
Ready?
What did they,

351
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,490
what did they kick her off at twitter 
for?

352
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,593
They kicked her off.
We're talking about Islam and talking 

353
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:07,070
about how twitter was celebrating a 
women's Day,

354
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,240
whatever,
whatever.

355
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:13,241
That was a on a certain day by focusing 
like the picture was one of those,

356
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:17,090
uh,
Islamic women that got elected to office

357
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,240
up in,
what was it,

358
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,243
Minnesota or somewhere,
so she said how hypocritical that was 

359
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:23,810
because,
you know,

360
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,540
Islam is for female genital mutilation 
and,

361
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,820
uh,
against women's rights and they kill gay

362
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,654
people and,
and that's all she posted and she got 

363
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:35,150
kicked off for hate speech against 
Islam.

364
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,050
And then her argument was Louis 
Farrakhan was saying,

365
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,460
you know,
I'm not an anti Semite,

366
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:43,880
I'm an anteater,
might equating Jews with insects,

367
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:48,881
which is pretty 19 thirties,
jeremy kind of a thing.

368
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,060
So,
uh,

369
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,640
you know,
while her heart was in the right place,

370
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,340
I guess it did come off a little wacky.

371
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,980
She also had a star of David,
a yellow star of David on her shirt,

372
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,330
uh,
as she was chained to twitter and people

373
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,210
got upset with that.
Ah,

374
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,960
there she is.
I just thought,

375
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:06,794
to tell you the truth,
I thought it was a good strategic move 

376
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,970
because you're going to buy time with 
that because the police do not want that

377
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:18,770
optic of a uniformed guy kind of pulling
a girl off.

378
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,920
They're wearing a star of David.
They could just picture looks bad.

379
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,790
So it might've bought her some time,
but I don't know if that was her motive.

380
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,080
She planned it out.
Well,

381
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,273
she did.
Apparently it was the number one 

382
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,530
trending topic on twitter,
which is odd that you know,

383
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,910
she gets kicked off and ends up being 
the number one trending topic.

384
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:38,744
What's really odd is this is while 
Manafort who may have perjured himself 

385
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,393
yours going after trump's deeper ties.
Cohen is now saying that trump was in 

386
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,010
cahoots with Putin.
He was going

387
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,040
to give them the $50,000,000
penthouse tower in Moscow.

388
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,050
You know,
all that.

389
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:55,500
But like,
no,

390
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,100
no,
no.

391
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,080
That girl got kicked off,
pick up to it.

392
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,070
It sounds ridiculous because I got,
like I said,

393
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,500
I got kicked off and I'm,
I'm

394
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,580
a little bummed about it.
Uh,

395
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,130
but uh,
it's why,

396
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,143
because it's odd.
It's not just a private company anymore 

397
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:17,300
that can do what they want.
I'm not free government regulation,

398
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,223
so I don't know how you fix this,
but twitter is now a thing where the 

399
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:22,424
presidents on it,
we're leaders are discussing things on 

400
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,660
it,
emergency management,

401
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:27,494
fema and the weather services.
They put out alerts in case of a danger 

402
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,243
or or some kind of event that's going to
happen and because of your political 

403
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:38,720
ideology or calling a girl period,
blood hair,

404
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,810
you're not privy to alerts and safety 
information that

405
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,220
well,
it's.

406
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,053
It's clear that it's not.
Everyone's doesn't have to follow the 

407
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:48,164
same rules.
We've already established that with 

408
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,290
Farah Khan.
We've also established that with trump.

409
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,690
Sam Harris has been on a.
He was,

410
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:54,950
at least,
I think he's abandoned it,

411
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,993
but it was on a quest to get jack to try
to hold up his terms of service 

412
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:04,070
agreement and kick trump off of twitter.
I was like,

413
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,900
look what he's doing.
He's threatening nuclear war.

414
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,213
Do you understand that?
This is the craziest use of twitter 

415
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:10,130
ever?
Yeah,

416
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,340
and I think Jack's position was that.
It is.

417
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,660
It's more beneficial to have him on and 
it's really,

418
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,913
we're getting to see his personality in 
a way we've never seen any president's 

419
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,450
personal.
Absolutely mean the,

420
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,990
the most ridiculous petty shit that he 
does,

421
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,470
like attacking Michelle Wolf because of 
her White House correspondents dinner.

422
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,500
You,
Colin people losers,

423
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,603
you know,
making fun of the girl on Joe 

424
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,330
Scarborough,
the girl he married.

425
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

426
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,060
That she had fucked up plastic surgery.
Her bleeding just make shit up.

427
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,600
I mean,
do you think she really,

428
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,550
really thinks she showed up?
Uh,

429
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:49,510
Maro Lago,
bleeding fucking plastic surgeries.

430
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,260
He's a fucking maniac.
It really is.

431
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,900
But meanwhile that,
it,

432
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,773
it,
it,

433
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,813
it's good for us to see because it 
educates us to who he is as a real 

434
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:00,224
person.
There's a lot of who you are just gets 

435
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:05,360
exposed in those tweets.
We little bit.

436
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,180
You can't know everything about a person
from their twitter,

437
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,163
but you can get,
you can parse out little chunks where 

438
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:14,000
you get a good taste.
And for him it's very,

439
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,440
very revealing.
Yeah,

440
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:18,740
it is a weird thing.
This is what I think this will be looked

441
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:19,574
back on as a very pivotal moment in 
American history and in politics where 

442
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,800
that kind of crossroad happened.
Yeah,

443
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,470
because we were,
we were pretty satisfied with,

444
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,610
uh,
that political speech thing that,

445
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,473
and we need to bring up the lower middle
class and they just go on and on and 

446
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:42,414
drone on.
It's this weird speech that no real 

447
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:48,520
human being ever speaks.
Like Hillary was hilarious.

448
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,200
And why Wayne?
Hey,

449
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:52,690
today is the guy.
It was fake.

450
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:55,300
It comes off as fake and phony.
Trump comes rolling in.

451
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,650
It's absolutely batshit insane.
Like the stuff he says,

452
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:01,460
like you were saying the other day,
he's,

453
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,343
he's giving a speech and he said that 
when he was younger people said he 

454
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:06,784
looked like Elvis because he was doing 
some kind of a commemorative thing for 

455
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,180
Elvis,
um,

456
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,260
uh,
down in Tennessee or somewhere.

457
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,060
And he says,
uh,

458
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,910
he looked like Elvis and we're laughing 
our asses off me and Keith,

459
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,120
uh,
because no one ever told me Elvis,

460
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,130
no one ever told him that.

461
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,561
And,
and,

462
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:28,630
and there's so many things.
And I'm a trump guy.

463
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,464
I voted for the guy because I wanted 
that monkey wrench thrown into the 

464
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,004
machine.
I felt we had gotten screwed too many 

465
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,830
decades and it was time to let 
Washington know,

466
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,730
like,
look,

467
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:44,110
we'd rather elect this nut than any of 
you guys.

468
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,290
So I think it proved a point.
Uh,

469
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,690
there are enough checks and balances in 
place where,

470
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,583
you know,
the likes of any one president really 

471
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:53,614
isn't going to do that much damage.
I think he's pulled the cover off a lot 

472
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:57,244
of stuff.
I think people are trying to compete 

473
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,674
with him on twitter.
Politicians are trying to play his game 

474
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:06,250
and it's kind of fun to watch as a comic
entertainer.

475
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,113
It's gold.
Do you see what Tulsi Gabbert said to 

476
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:09,724
him?
What?

477
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,480
She's a congresswoman from Hawaii.
She said,

478
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:15,170
uh,
being Saudi Arabia,

479
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,260
bitch isn't making America first.

480
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,580
That's a congresswoman.
Say they're all kind of taking that.

481
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,710
They never used to do that.
No,

482
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,743
they didn't.
And it's odd that a 70 year old guy was 

483
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:32,911
the one that was like bringing twitter 
to social media into this forum.

484
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,023
It is on and yeah,
you would think it would be some young 

485
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,604
guy get in there and do it,
but I'd never do it the way he's doing 

486
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:39,600
it.
No,

487
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,980
that's just like a reckless maniac.
It's,

488
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,690
and,
and that's because he can.

489
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,940
Yeah,
the guy you,

490
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,020
you'll never see a chain of events like 
what happened to elect Donald Trump,

491
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,300
the rich guy.
He's a billionaire and billion,

492
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,710
whatever you want to call him.
He's got a lot of money from his dad,

493
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,940
from his,
his dad.

494
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:58,900
And then,
you know,

495
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:02,080
I remember him in New York when I was a 
kid.

496
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,990
Trump was always in the news developer.

497
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,120
He was always banging heads with 
politicians,

498
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:07,954
trying to get some kind of zoning thing 
going or build some other tower 

499
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:12,310
somewhere.
And uh,

500
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,300
so we were all familiar with them and we
knew he was like this piece of shit guy.

501
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,270
Like everyone was surprised,
like,

502
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:20,830
Oh God,
he grabbed her by the pussy.

503
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:21,664
He's like,
we saw in the daily news and the New 

504
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,560
York Post every week,
trump was with some other hula is.

505
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,740
So it wasn't a surprise to us.
Uh,

506
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,860
but he got out there and it was the 
perfect timing,

507
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,620
like we come off the,
uh,

508
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:40,540
the heels of eight years of a Democratic
president,

509
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,420
uh,
and it just was,

510
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,960
people were ready for a maniac to be in.
The white people were,

511
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,640
some people were exactly my favorite 
image of the election was that lady with

512
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:56,660
the sock hat on her knees with the 
glasses screaming.

513
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,130
That to me ushered in this era of 
outrage and chaos.

514
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

515
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,043
It just said that was like the primal 
scream that set off the dominoes and 

516
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:13,340
they're all in motion right now.
It wasn't supposed to happen.

517
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,330
It wasn't supposed to happen.
Hillary was supposed to be president.

518
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,493
That's what everybody thought it was 
going to go down in history as just one 

519
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:23,570
of those wacky elections.
And then business as usual.

520
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,823
But,
uh,

521
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,801
you know,
when,

522
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:30,170
when trump won,
it turned everything upside down and rip

523
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,760
the cover off of,
I think,

524
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,560
not only politics in Washington,
but uh,

525
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,520
Hollywood,
uh,

526
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,600
uh,
the mainstream media,

527
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,960
the news media,
everything had the covers ripped off and

528
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:46,961
everyone's now got a peek inside and 
realize how fucked up everything is.

529
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,873
You used to assume Washington,
at least the people had some kind of 

530
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:52,874
control like they were,
they were adults doing the job that 

531
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:56,060
needed to be.

532
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,380
And then you realize,
oh my God,

533
00:24:57,381 --> 00:25:00,270
everyone's just a piece of shit.
Do you remember?

534
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,330
Here's the story that disappeared from 
years ago.

535
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:05,540
Do you remember the Washington Madam,
that suicide or self?

536
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,433
Oh yeah,
yeah.

537
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,990
Book filled with politicians that were,
uh,

538
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,003
getting there.
We're banging all these prostitutes and 

539
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:14,750
she was going to release everything and 
she was doing press conferences and then

540
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,460
she committed suicide,
committed suicide.

541
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:17,090
But it's like,
well,

542
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:17,970
case closed,
you know,

543
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,160
no big deal that will last her books.
Yeah,

544
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:20,531
yeah.
Whatever,

545
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:21,530
whatever,
whatever.

546
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:23,420
And then it disappeared.
It disappeared.

547
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,160
Things like that happen.
Oh,

548
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,980
flag politicians killed people.
Oh yeah.

549
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,303
There's,
there's secret backroom deals that 

550
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:32,594
happen and it's crazy.
House of cards is way closer to reality 

551
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:37,310
than people would like to believe.
Yeah.

552
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,270
Yeah.
Closer.

553
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,410
We,
uh,

554
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,590
over the course of the decades upon 
decades,

555
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,510
uh,
every year that goes by,

556
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,344
we seem to get a little more knowledge 
and a little less confident in the 

557
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:50,294
government.

558
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,730
I mean,
I watched some shit from the fifties,

559
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,703
you know,
there's plenty of things on youtube and 

560
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,750
even even industrial films,
just this thing of how a family,

561
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,930
how to raise your family.
There had to be a good wife,

562
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:03,764
all that stuff.
And it was all this weird propaganda of 

563
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:10,310
what America was.
And then as years go by,

564
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:11,031
you realize,
oh,

565
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:11,864
it was all bullshit.
Like politicians were always getting 

566
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:18,830
rich and no one seems to know how or 
why.

567
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,520
And these deals that are made aren't 
always in our best interest.

568
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,270
They're not civil servants there to 
represent and help you.

569
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,001
And,
and,

570
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:27,834
and as the years go by,
we see more and more of this and the 

571
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:34,880
past two years with trump has just been 
a man quite a crash course.

572
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,200
It really has.
Yeah.

573
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,080
It's great.
I'm fascinated to see where it goes.

574
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,980
I'm fascinated to see if he seems,
you know,

575
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,980
I mean they always called

576
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,450
Godaddy,
the Teflon Don,

577
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,870
but it seems like trump is the teflon 
donald.

578
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,190
I mean,
he seems,

579
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,700
it seems like all these things keep 
happening and,

580
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,420
and even because I remember Justin 
Martin Dale,

581
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:59,970
a comedian friend of mine is hilarious.
He goes,

582
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,340
uh,
he was talking about stormy Daniels.

583
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,650
He was like,
she's our Monica Lewinsky.

584
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,980
She's going to take them down the fuck.
That's not happening.

585
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:08,970
No,
you don't get it.

586
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,240
He doesn't care that they know he fucked
her.

587
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,400
Yeah.
He doesn't care to understand.

588
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,190
It's not.
You have to care for it to work.

589
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,600
Right.
And that's just it.

590
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,910
People don't really care.
It's a,

591
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,070
well,
some people don't care.

592
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:23,904
I,
I follow like Rosie O'donnell's account 

593
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,990
on twitter and Rob Reiner is another one
and for two years,

594
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:31,824
over two years they have just been like 
counting down and the day that it's 

595
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:38,380
like,
oh,

596
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,350
impeachments right around the corner.
Oh,

597
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:41,184
he's out.

598
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh,
they're gonna.

599
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,833
Put them in prison.
I hope you and your son get a cell next 

600
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:49,020
to each other and it's like,
how long are you going to do this?

601
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,883
Eight years.
Is it going to be eight years of you 

602
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:51,954
going?
Well any day now Keith Miller is going 

603
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:55,410
to.
Yeah.

604
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,243
Do you remember when he was doing that 
wacky show in a basement somewhere for 

605
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,840
Gq,
like a mental patient,

606
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,703
like legitimately like a mental patient 
resistance screaming and it was like he 

607
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:06,864
was doing like.
It was almost like burlesque or 

608
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:11,190
something.
You know what I'm saying?

609
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,173
Like you know how it was like the radio 
version of burlesque is like when you 

610
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:17,304
see a girl doing burlesque,
it's like a throwback to an old timey 

611
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:22,650
way of doing things.
Like the guy,

612
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,100
the handlebar mustache with a bowler 
capital introducer.

613
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,160
She's body,
she is bodacious.

614
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:30,360
Please welcome Matt.

615
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,193
I'm blah blah blah.
And she comes out to music that nobody 

616
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:36,180
listens to anymore and she's dancing 
around.

617
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,710
It's very end.
They're there.

618
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:41,400
They're always kind of big girls.
They're not skinny little strippers.

619
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,043
There are girls who eat,
so it's like it's a throwback to a 

620
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:49,020
different time of,
of rowdiness and when he was in front of

621
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:49,854
that screen,
like doing this thing with his suit on 

622
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:52,884
and tie like d and everything was like 
really well written and these precise 

623
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:58,464
points and I don't understand like what 
the red blue and the background was 

624
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,973
either.
It's just,

625
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,890
it was.
So it seemed like something that someone

626
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:05,724
had set up,
like not as good as your compound of 

627
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:09,360
the.
Yeah.

628
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,000
You live from the compound.
It wasn't,

629
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,790
it wasn't as good as that.
It's like that's the background.

630
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,920
This is for Gq.
Gq was like,

631
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:21,810
okay,
we have $30 dollars I think.

632
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,920
Uh,
I think uh,

633
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:26,070
Charlie's got a camera.
He could bring it in $30.

634
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:26,640
Good.
Okay.

635
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,170
We have a table,
the Ikea table.

636
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:31,020
That's $12.
You have $18 left.

637
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,380
We got some construction paper for the 
background.

638
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,580
What the fuck is this?
I got some big ass blue and blue and red

639
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,240
paint.
Yeah.

640
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,720
Posters.
Like what,

641
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,420
what is that?
And then he would just pontificate there

642
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:51,100
and he and his last thing was like,
because the end is eminent,

643
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,230
there's no,
no reason for me to go on.

644
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,280
Right.
If it's finished.

645
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,241
Yeah.
What is this?

646
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:59,640
My work here is done play some of this.
Trump is finished in one year.

647
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,640
One year ago.
This week.

648
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:01,850
Exactly.
One year ago.

649
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:04,550
Last November 11,
2017.

650
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:05,384
It was when he quit.

651
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,833
Get a pardon from trump,
wore the bowler as I've also reported 

652
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:11,304
here,
has succeeded in finding a way around 

653
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,820
trumps.
Pardon?

654
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,110
Power in either of these near 
certainties spelled trump's do.

655
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,700
So that's the most obvious of the seven 
ways for trump to go.

656
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,020
Now smaller.
Really,

657
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,000
we'll get him on Russia.
It will be ugly.

658
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,330
It will tear this country nearly apart,
but it will be necessary.

659
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,230
The second way is as I've also 
repeatedly suggested here,

660
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,243
that Mahler doesn't really need to prove
anything about trump and Russian 

661
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,360
sabotage of the election.
There seems to be so much obstruction of

662
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:43,194
justice for the firing of James Comey to
the lies about trump jr's meetings with 

663
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:47,784
the Russians,
that it's hard to pick out a key player 

664
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:53,790
in the trump inner circle who could not 
be guilty of it.

665
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,290
It's so funny.
A year ago and it's like,

666
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,120
it's still going.
Still going.

667
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,870
Still going and it gets fake news.
Yeah.

668
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,580
And it now fake news.
It's a hoax,

669
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,400
but it is interesting.
Like molar to me,

670
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:14,401
it's fascinating because he seems like a
ruthless motherfucker takes his time.

671
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,080
He's like a guy says,
hey,

672
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,000
look at me.
I'm going to kill you.

673
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,040
It's not going to be today.
Okay.

674
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,890
That's all you need to know.
Yes I can be today,

675
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:24,724
but I'm going to fucking kill you.
And like every day he's plotting on 

676
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:29,440
killing you.
You see them drive by your house in ways

677
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,600
like when is,
when is the hammer fall?

678
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:33,070
And you look out your window of your 
office.

679
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:34,990
He's out here.
Look at that guy drinking coffee.

680
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,850
Oh,
he has seen some shit.

681
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,530
Oh,
this guy,

682
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,670
he's.
Yeah.

683
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,480
I mean he's a cold blooded intelligence 
agent.

684
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,323
Yeah.
Yeah,

685
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,930
those guys have seen everything.
He knows the inner workings,

686
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:47,803
the machine,
and he knows how you bring a guy like 

687
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:53,260
that down and how you fuck it up and 
he's doing everything.

688
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:55,750
That leads me to believe that he's not 
fucking it up.

689
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,993
This is a slow play and if there is,
if there is anything to the Russian 

690
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:03,604
thing,
you would think something would have 

691
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:05,890
leaked out by now.
Well,

692
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:06,940
it has.
I mean it was,

693
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,863
there was a video the other day of 
Donald that they just played on cnn of 

694
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:14,460
Donald was talking about how many times 
he's actually been to rush donald junior

695
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,660
and you know,
he had said that he hadn't been.

696
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,660
But then there's another video of him 
from years ago saying,

697
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:20,950
yeah,
I've been there many times.

698
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,331
Five,
six,

699
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:22,960
seven,
eight,

700
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,150
talking about business.
The problem with,

701
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,160
uh,
the people that are going after trump,

702
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,683
they don't seem to understand the guy 
right up until he became president of 

703
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:37,240
the United States was just a private 
citizen businessman.

704
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,100
So he had a lot of dealings around

705
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,770
the world with his real estate and 
buildings and golf courses.

706
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:49,780
All this shit happened when he was just 
a citizen doing business now,

707
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,730
whether it was ethical or not,
um,

708
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,043
that,
that could definitely be brought into 

709
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:58,680
question,
whether it's legal or not a,

710
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,650
I'm sure that's what they're looking 
into also,

711
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:01,484
but he wasn't,
he wasn't beholden to the people as a 

712
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:06,164
public servant.
There wasn't a conflict of interest 

713
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:08,714
because he was a lifelong politician and
using the power of his office to make 

714
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:17,030
deals so,
and that also goes hand in hand with him

715
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:18,870
just fucking around.
Like,

716
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,793
like if he went from a selectman in his 
hometown and then years and years go by 

717
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,510
and then you're the president and you 
built that career up.

718
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,703
Any at any point in there they could 
call you out on being a horrible human 

719
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,470
being because you fucked girls or you're
this.

720
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,400
So you'd had a shady business dealings.
But up until two years ago,

721
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,650
he was just donald fucking trump.
Yeah.

722
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,513
So it's hard to call them out on even 
dealing with Russia because there's 

723
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:45,650
plenty of business and deal with Russia 
and China.

724
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:46,484
I think the question is whether or not 
he colluded with Russia to get 

725
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:50,954
information about Hillary and also to to
to put out all that propaganda against 

726
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:56,744
Hillary and also saying that they're 
going to make a deal to do the trump 

727
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:00,494
tower in Moscow.
This is all while he was running for 

728
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:05,510
president.
Not being honest about it.

729
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,970
I think that's,
that's where it gets again.

730
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:10,580
I don't know almost there's anything 
illegal there.

731
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,653
I don't know if there's anything that,
that he did that is illegal because I 

732
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:16,214
believe when you're campaigning say 
whatever the fuck you want to anybody 

733
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,330
really running.
I mean you're really running anything.

734
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,770
It really running the country.
Yeah.

735
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,604
If he lost the presidency,
he would still have to have some ducks 

736
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:31,680
in a row to continue his business.
So you know,

737
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,533
and his son took over that part of,
of what he was doing so he could 

738
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:36,584
campaign.
So whether Donny Jr went over to Russia 

739
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,980
or not,
I don't really see.

740
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,610
You might think it's unethical and you 
might go,

741
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,470
well,
did he say if we win,

742
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:48,860
we'll do this and help you out.
So who knows about that part of it,

743
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,933
but I don't see in and of itself him 
going over there being that big a 

744
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,010
problem and the fact that,
you know,

745
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,063
the Clinton campaign and the DNC,
they had a lot of shady deals going on 

746
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:04,631
with Russia also in that crazy dossier 
and an English spy and a Russian like.

747
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,900
And that just never seems to get any 
traction.

748
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,220
It's weird.
Well,

749
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:13,780
there's way more left wing media 
publications in the right way.

750
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,743
Absolutely.
Just the fact there's only a few right 

751
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:17,100
wing,
uh,

752
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,000
newspapers and right wing websites are 
oftentimes maligned,

753
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,173
treated seriously.
Like there's no right wing newspaper 

754
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:29,610
that's treated with the same amount of 
respect is the New York Times columnist.

755
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,190
It doesn't exist.
Now.

756
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:32,024
What the,
uh,

757
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,280
the New York Post,
the New York Post right wing.

758
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,973
Outrageous.
Yeah.

759
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,070
They don't give

760
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,370
a fuck who you are.
Liberal Democrat,

761
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,390
Sro,
conservative Republican.

762
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,770
They'll fuck you.
Some of the headlines that have come off

763
00:35:44,771 --> 00:35:47,520
of the fucking post have been classic 
over the years.

764
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,770
They're amazing.
Yeah.

765
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,010
Like comics.
Yeah.

766
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,540
Yeah.
It's just comedy.

767
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,820
One was one I thought was just so 
douchey when Fred astaire died,

768
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,730
it was said a stairway to heaven like 
fucking,

769
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,390
but that someone must have gotten a hit 
for this.

770
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,700
The one thing that I do love about New 
York and Boston to yeah,

771
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,300
is a harshness to the comedy because 
people are fucking cold.

772
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,480
It's cold in the wintertime is calling 
like fuck you and that growing up there,

773
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:21,860
man,
it fucking flavored me flavored bourbon.

774
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,720
There's a million guys like that that 
like that.

775
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:26,850
Patrice,
that fucking comedy.

776
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,684
A lot of it came out of that part of the
world because that part of the world is 

777
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:31,680
different.
Isn't that weird?

778
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,513
It's,
it's cold and you think that just makes 

779
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:36,384
people angry.
A cold and a lot of people I think and 

780
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,350
very few people makes people like more 
down home.

781
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,180
Me and compassionate and they stay 
together.

782
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:48,000
Tana,
except for a few serial killers randomly

783
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,860
scattered,
scattered out into the woods,

784
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,003
but other than that you get like people 
that work together and help each other 

785
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:54,990
because they realized they were in this 
together.

786
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,820
Yeah,
there is A.

787
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,653
There's a stark difference between New 
York and Boston based comics and La 

788
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,370
based company.
It's amazing difference.

789
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:05,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

790
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:09,240
And some of them have that crossover 
appeal there and they've moved,

791
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,450
you know,
and uh,

792
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,060
like bill,
but maintains that Boston sensibility,

793
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:16,350
that New York sensibility.
Yeah.

794
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:17,184
Yeah.
What's appealing about him is that he's 

795
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:19,620
still a savage,
right,

796
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,730
exactly.
Yeah.

797
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,450
Yeah,
yeah.

798
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,400
Like that.
You don't grow that out here.

799
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:26,550
It's sunny,
it's nice every day.

800
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,383
Everyone's a.
everyone's seems kind of pleasant out 

801
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:33,150
here,
whether it's real or phoniness,

802
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,223
but it comes off as pleasantry and in 
New York is just a grave disregard for 

803
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:40,470
everybody.
Uh,

804
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,670
you literally step over people.
Many people lose their value.

805
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:45,803
Yeah.
Like if you have a million pennies and 

806
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,170
you drop a penny,
put up.

807
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,900
Shit.
Lost the guy on the train.

808
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:53,883
Now it is odd when you think about if 
there was somebody just laying in the 

809
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:04,590
gutter of the street in some small town 
in Kansas,

810
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,620
uh,
the police and ambulance would be called

811
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:09,940
and people would stop and ask if he was 
okay.

812
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:10,774
And,
and in New York you literally step over 

813
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:14,970
those people.
You just don't even look in their face.

814
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,103
It's a.
it's an inconvenience that someone is 

815
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:22,270
laying on the sidewalk.
If you were in the middle of a snowstorm

816
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,393
and you were,
your car broke down and you saw a guy 

817
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,380
laying on the side of the road.
Yeah,

818
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,610
you'd help him.
Of course.

819
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:30,211
He'd be like,
oh,

820
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:31,170
Jesus,
poor guy.

821
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:32,310
Look,
we've got to help him to.

822
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,533
Hey Buddy.
You're alright.

823
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,393
Yeah.
Yeah.

824
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,070
Not so

825
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,750
much New York,
New York.

826
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:40,960
You just see him lying in his own piss 
needle hanging out of his dick.

827
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,860
And I'm pissed that it stinks down in 
the subway.

828
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,810
Fucking gross.
Like fucking disgusting,

829
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:47,860
man.
Yeah.

830
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,120
No compassion stink too though.
In a steamy August day.

831
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,180
It's the worst and it's gotten worse.
Uh,

832
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,373
under uh,
Deblazio who's a mayor of New York now 

833
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,800
and say what you want about Giuliani,
who now is batshit crazy?

834
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,590
What happened with him?
I don't know.

835
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,890
I blew a fuse.
He's not respectable anymore.

836
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,970
He's like some kind of.
Well,

837
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:10,804
he aligned himself with trump,
so that immediately gets you put into a 

838
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,570
category.
But he's also a little.

839
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,330
I think he's got some dementia going on,
like he just doesn't seem right.

840
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:25,150
It is lost his comb over that he had a 
comb over for,

841
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:26,470
what is that?
Like a,

842
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,720
what's his name with the comb over and 
he realized,

843
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:30,250
Oh my God,
I'm fucking crazy.

844
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,200
Samson's hair.
It's like that.

845
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,760
He,
he lost the last wisps,

846
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,280
those last wisps of comb-over yeah.
That he'd had during nine slash 11 going

847
00:39:39,281 --> 00:39:40,114
on.
Yeah,

848
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,100
he was at one point,
you know,

849
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:43,930
after nine slash 11,
they call it nine,

850
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,610
10,
2011.

851
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,630
He was a piece of shit.
No one liked Giuliani.

852
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,000
He ruined New York.
He ruined it by commercializing it,

853
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,140
cleaning up all the porn theaters.
Uh,

854
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,043
getting rid of the tunnel bunnies and 
the squeegee guys like he went on a 

855
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:00,334
tear,
just gave the police department carte 

856
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:05,230
blanche to start racking head and taking
care of business.

857
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:06,064
A cleaned up New York Times Square 
turned into a Disney type atmosphere 

858
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:11,950
instead of that drug addled fucking mess
that it was.

859
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,233
And,
and people hated them for kind of 

860
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:18,400
ruining that Gritty New York that we saw
in taxi driver and shit.

861
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,350
And then nine slash 11,
he was America's mayor.

862
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,300
That's what they called them,
America's mayor.

863
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,750
He's going to Yankee Games and ovations 
and people.

864
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,410
He's standing with the other.
He looked so crazy.

865
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:33,550
Person on the right.
Yeah.

866
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:36,740
Yeah.
He is totally shaved his head to talk to

867
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,790
them.
I say,

868
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,643
listen Bro,
there's a lot of power in just shaving 

869
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,560
your that head motherfucker.
Yeah.

870
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:44,440
You feel good.
You feel like a guy who has like hair on

871
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:45,274
the side of his head,
unless you do a lot of drugs like 

872
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:47,644
hunter,
s Thompson.

873
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,900
It's hard.
You can't pull that off,

874
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,250
I think.
Yeah.

875
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,680
Uh,
for right hand side.

876
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,290
That's a,
that's a comb over in the beginning.

877
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,160
Yeah.
Above that.

878
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,993
Above that.
Above that to right to the right of the 

879
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:00,190
suit.
Look at that.

880
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,140
Oh yeah.
That's where it's first started.

881
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,230
That's the full.
Oh my God,

882
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:06,260
look at that.
Oh,

883
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,070
the back.
Like what did he do?

884
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:12,100
Did he try to get plugs or something in 
the front?

885
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,840
I don't think so.
I don't know what that is.

886
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,770
It's just rocking the full strong 
comb-over that is.

887
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:18,820
Uh,
he,

888
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:20,980
uh,
he had a lot to do with the,

889
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,820
the,
the,

890
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,653
um,
getting rid of organized crime in New 

891
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,500
York City,
like the mafia,

892
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,393
the five families,
all that shit was still running pretty 

893
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:34,040
rampant throughout the seventies and 
eighties as

894
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,873
a kid.
Me and my brother used to laugh our 

895
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:36,554
asses off.
We'd open the newspaper and it was like 

896
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,710
Johnny the Horse,
he was found dead.

897
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,440
And so we laugh our asses off at the 
names,

898
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,380
like just those,
those mob names.

899
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,303
It's hilarious.
And that scene in Goodfellas at the 

900
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,430
beginning when they're just going 
through and,

901
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:53,264
you know,
the nose and killer and this guy and 

902
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,100
they all have those fucking names that 
are hilarious.

903
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,031
And uh,
yeah,

904
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:01,910
Juliana was a big part of that.
I'm surprised they didn't kill him.

905
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,163
Like he was absolutely irresponsible.
He kept going after them and kept 

906
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:09,760
putting them away with the,
you know,

907
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,460
the new Rico statutes that they had and 
a locked up.

908
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:14,780
A lot of mobsters,
man.

909
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:15,591
So,
well,

910
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:16,424
you know,
another problem with the mom says they 

911
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,104
started rapping.
I mean,

912
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:18,871
yeah,
yeah,

913
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:19,704
yeah.
As soon as you start ratting on each 

914
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:22,040
other all year,
mystique is gone.

915
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,320
Your whole,
your whole legend is gone.

916
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,500
This the whole thing is that you guys 
have Omerta.

917
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,150
You keep your fucking mouth shut.
You do your time like a man when you get

918
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:33,800
out and you're a hero and this whole 
thing keeps going.

919
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,820
This thing of ours,
this thing was,

920
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,690
but those fucking pussies didn't want to
go to jail.

921
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,800
Isn't that something like the old school
guys would be offered,

922
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:43,634
you know,
you can walk or you could get a really 

923
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:48,660
easy sentence.
Just talk a fuck your mother and,

924
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,600
and,
and then yeah,

925
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,250
if they reached the point where it's 
like,

926
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,593
yeah,
I,

927
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,463
I'm not built for prison.
When they would put them in prison 

928
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:56,894
though,
it was like in Goodfellas it would be 

929
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:01,100
able to cook and they paid the guards 
off a sweet setup.

930
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,030
The internet ruined all that too.
Yeah.

931
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:06,290
Yeah.
You went,

932
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,150
well it was probably all dead before the
Internet,

933
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:09,300
but,
but you know,

934
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:12,230
like Sammy the bull Gravano,
he was free.

935
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,600
He did his time to the minimum amount of
time he killed at least 10 people that,

936
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,420
I mean,
he,

937
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,640
he confessed to them,
you know,

938
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,100
talked about the morality did and how he
did them.

939
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,580
He wanted it so bad.
They wanted it so bad.

940
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,773
Let me,
Sammy the bull gravano was a fucking 

941
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:32,240
straight up psychopath.
Yeah.

942
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,163
That's total serial killer.
And they let him walk and then he got 

943
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:38,750
arrested eventually for selling ecstasy 
in Phoenix.

944
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,150
He moved to Phoenix after that.
Yeah.

945
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,880
Yeah.
And then he was running shit down there.

946
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:48,260
And how did he just not get whacked out?
Like was the mob was gone.

947
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,980
They all were gone.
No one cared.

948
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,180
Hated it all.
It all crumbled at that something.

949
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,910
Yeah,
just like A.

950
00:43:54,911 --> 00:43:55,790
Yeah,
poof.

951
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,770
Went away.
The thing that like,

952
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,030
he was the first one that was like real 
flashy and public about that.

953
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,983
They didn't like that.
Vincent the Chin always used to walk 

954
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:06,440
around like a crazy person in the 
bathroom.

955
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,610
Bathroom.
It was nuts.

956
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,280
But he would,
he would give people directions while he

957
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:11,114
was doing that,
but he felt like everything was being 

958
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:13,064
bugged so that they would do,
is they have bugged cars along his 

959
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:18,260
walking route.
They can record him.

960
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,910
Oh,
that is hilarious.

961
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,100
What he was doing.
Jesus.

962
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,250
There's always a way.
There's always a way to get you.

963
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,230
Yeah.
The mystique was gone though.

964
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,080
Yeah.
It wasn't really like the Russians still

965
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:32,010
have the mystique Russian mobsters.

966
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,740
They are brutal,
scary ones.

967
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:39,600
Like they are the scary ones.
There's a worse ma because regardless of

968
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:40,434
what it turned into,
there was a time where the Italian mob 

969
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,160
did have a line.
Like you didn't cross family,

970
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:48,550
things like that.
Uh,

971
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,330
but the Russians,
all my God,

972
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:54,720
will they fuck up an entire family?
The dog.

973
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,020
Everything gets killed in the worst way.
Yeah.

974
00:44:58,021 --> 00:44:59,760
They're scary.
Scary motherfuckers.

975
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,530
I had a,
an experience.

976
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:05,460
I'm out.
It was a broadway I guess.

977
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,323
Uh,
and they have those peddle cabs that go 

978
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:10,350
around and they were all Russian dudes,
big legs on them.

979
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:11,184
And they peddle around and I was looking
for a cab or real cab to take me 

980
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:14,754
downtown.
I wasn't gonna ride 15 blocks in a 

981
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,120
tricycle with Uri peddling in front of 
me.

982
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:21,901
So,
uh,

983
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:24,260
this guy passed by once and said,
you need the cab.

984
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:24,961
I was like,
no,

985
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:25,830
I'm good,
thanks.

986
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,260
Comes around again.
I'm still waiting for a cab and he goes,

987
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,270
cab.
And I was like,

988
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,390
I'm not going to have you pedaled me 15 
fucking blocks.

989
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:36,060
No move.
And,

990
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,850
and you could yell at a cab driver in 
New York.

991
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,953
They'll yell out your window and stuff.
They've rarely will get out of their 

992
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:42,780
car.
They know,

993
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,550
you know,
you've got the medallion right there.

994
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:45,384
You could just call the number and say 
you were being harassed by a cab driver 

995
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,990
so they won't do anything.
This guy gets off his fucking bike,

996
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,140
you have a fucking problem.
Fucking problem was.

997
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,130
And I was just like,
oh shit,

998
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,480
it's going down.
This guy means business.

999
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,530
And of course I'm like,
no,

1000
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,400
no.
All good.

1001
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,690
All good.
I thank you.

1002
00:46:06,691 --> 00:46:11,340
I don't need a a cab.
You'll write the motherfuck and that was

1003
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:11,490
it.

1004
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,340
But you don't fuck with Russia.
No,

1005
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,850
they're not regular white people.
No,

1006
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:15,820
they're not.
They're not.

1007
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,850
They're hard people.
Yeah.

1008
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:18,684
Yeah.
You see that in the UFC is a lot of bad 

1009
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:21,960
ass rush.
Well,

1010
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,700
obviously we should know.
We saw that a recent.

1011
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,500
Yeah.
When was on top of connor punched him in

1012
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:30,950
the face saying let's talk.
No talk.

1013
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,580
Boom,
let's talk.

1014
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,540
Come up.
We'd talk.

1015
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,580
Boom.
Just twisted.

1016
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:36,421
Terrific.
Yeah.

1017
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:37,254
Yeah.
And then they got those other videos 

1018
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:43,881
that you see on youtube and whatnot of 
Russians just up in a steel.

1019
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:44,814
Ibm's yeah,
like a hundred stories up backflips 

1020
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,193
swinging back backflips hanging bike.
Two fingers in that and sometimes 

1021
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,080
falling.
Yeah.

1022
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:55,943
My hands are sweating.
You just talking about that makes my 

1023
00:46:57,421 --> 00:46:59,640
hands feel like it is so uncomfortable 
to watch.

1024
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,550
And uh,
because they're,

1025
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,453
they get themselves in these positions 
where maybe there's this thin little 

1026
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,443
alcove and,
and they put their hands against one 

1027
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:12,510
side their feet against the other.
If your feet slip,

1028
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,450
there's no.
No.

1029
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:18,210
Recovering drives me crazy is not.
Look,

1030
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:21,660
I got goosebumps.
Is it a weird to get a visceral reaction

1031
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:22,923
to just the thought.
And I have some friends that just know 

1032
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:27,090
that I freak out.
So they sent me those.

1033
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:28,850
Every Christ.
Yeah.

1034
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,190
There are some things

1035
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,100
that,
uh,

1036
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:34,490
are online.
Scott,

1037
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,800
what the fuck?
Oh my God.

1038
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,850
Oh.
Oh,

1039
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,880
they are nuts.
I can't do this man.

1040
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,960
My hands are pouring ca.
Yeah.

1041
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,840
Oh my God.
Look at this crazy ass hole.

1042
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,580
Oh my God.
Crazy shit.

1043
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,710
Oh.
Oh.

1044
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,710
Oh.
Oh.

1045
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,240
Oh.
What does it say?

1046
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:08,170
Dare Devil returns with latest shocking 
stunt on skyscraper.

1047
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:12,910
This fucking mother fucker.
But he's doing a handstand on.

1048
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,710
What is that?
A three inch ledge.

1049
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,650
Oh God.
Come on.

1050
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,630
Come around the corner.
What are you doing this?

1051
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,600
You fuck a one little.
One.

1052
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:30,400
Little fucking miscalculation.
Or how do you do that?

1053
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,620
How do you know your center of gravity?
Is it just gonna?

1054
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,910
Pull your right.
The fuck up.

1055
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,920
Jesus Christ.
He went around the corner.

1056
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,970
That's nuts.
What is this guy's lifelike?

1057
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,930
If he decides he's going to do this?
This makes me very uncomfortable.

1058
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:45,820
That is so fucking high up.

1059
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,210
It's so high.
That is so high.

1060
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,353
I wouldn't,
I can't do what he did if he was on the 

1061
00:48:51,101 --> 00:48:52,000
ground,
right?

1062
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:52,320
Yeah,
yeah,

1063
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,991
yeah.
I can't.

1064
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:57,910
I can't do those handstands and all that
jazz brown mark out three inches and try

1065
00:48:57,911 --> 00:48:58,744
to stay on it with your hand or mark it 
up enough so that you like put pads 

1066
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:02,710
under me.
Right,

1067
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,603
right.
And then give it so I could jump up and 

1068
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:07,300
grab it and hang out.
See how much of that I could do,

1069
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,550
like a couple of things.
I could king from my fingers.

1070
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:13,120
I might be able to pull myself up,
but if I got to the top I probably slip.

1071
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,103
Yeah.
Yeah.

1072
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,380
Your height will definitely fuck with 
you.

1073
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,250
Like if you're riding a bike on a 
sidewalk,

1074
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,760
you will never fall off the sidewalk.
You could just ride your bike.

1075
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:25,810
You don't even have to think about it.

1076
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,910
Sidewalk what?
Couple of feet wide.

1077
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,280
If that was over like the Grand Canyon,
you,

1078
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,820
you would be shaking.
You couldn't do it.

1079
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:38,590
And it's the same fucking thing.
It's just your perception and the height

1080
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:39,790
and you know,
you'd be,

1081
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,200
you'd be fucked up.
You'd be like,

1082
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:42,034
there's going to fall off.
We have that htc vibe in the back room 

1083
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:45,791
here.
Oh yeah.

1084
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:46,440
Yeah.
And uh,

1085
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,430
there's one game we have to download 
that game.

1086
00:49:48,431 --> 00:49:49,264
We haven't gotten that game when you go 
to the hardware store and you buy a two 

1087
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,150
by four and you lay it down on the floor
and then the game is,

1088
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:59,720
you put the vr goggles on and you're 
walking on this two by four over,

1089
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
like in between two skyscrapers.
Right?

1090
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:05,750
So as you're doing it in here,
so this is,

1091
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,740
this is the actual game.
Oh my God.

1092
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,150
You step out.
Oh,

1093
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,360
here's the two by four.
So this two by four is real.

1094
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,390
Like you have an actual two by fours 
really walking on this.

1095
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,210
So you're feeling it and you walk the 
plank.

1096
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,900
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1097
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:24,160
And you look down,
you're like,

1098
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,610
what is that thing floating in front of?
You don't know.

1099
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,330
What's that supposed to be,
Jamie?

1100
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:30,740
I've never done it.
I don't know.

1101
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,550
It's uh,
yeah,

1102
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:35,384
the uh,
first of all watching it on a screen 

1103
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:39,650
does vr no justice.
You can't really,

1104
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:43,760
you are in a space.
It's so cold to kind of look around.

1105
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:46,370
They,
they definitely have more work to do.

1106
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:47,320
Yeah,
it's a,

1107
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,163
it looks cool.
You feel like you're in a three d 

1108
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:51,450
environment,
but it's not very photo realistic.

1109
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,310
No.
Uh,

1110
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,850
for kids are addicted to it.
Really run here afterschool.

1111
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,440
Oh really?
Put the vr goggles.

1112
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,283
They fight over it and they put the vr 
goggles on and play these fucking crazy 

1113
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:03,770
games.
Yeah.

1114
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:04,670
Uh,
I have,

1115
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:05,504
uh,
the Oculus and the vive and the 

1116
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:07,784
playstation vr at home and right now the
Oculus is the highest quality of the vr 

1117
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:15,990
goggles.
Um,

1118
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,340
I think playstation has some pretty cool
games out there though.

1119
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:20,320
[inaudible]

1120
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,550
does too,
but I think uh,

1121
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:26,930
a Oculus is going to come out very soon 
with a completely wireless one.

1122
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,140
So it was a htc vive.
Yeah.

1123
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:29,974
Yeah.
So you're not tethered to anything and 

1124
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:34,160
you're tripping over wires and shit.
That's going to be big.

1125
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:34,940
Yeah.
That,

1126
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,520
that's pretty huge.
It's weird though because uh,

1127
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,880
some games aren't conducive to vr and 
you would think like I play call of duty

1128
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:47,550
or battlefield five World War II thing 
just came out and I love that,

1129
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,433
that game.
But I couldn't play that for our 

1130
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,330
[inaudible].
I will play for fucking hours on end and

1131
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:58,420
to have the goggles on that long and uh,
trying to play a shooter like that.

1132
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,363
Um,
I think vr right now is more conducive 

1133
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:05,600
to experiences than it is like that.
That's pretty much not a game.

1134
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:09,560
It's an experience and it brings you 
into a whole nother three d world around

1135
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:09,950
you.

1136
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,990
But uh,
like a shooter game,

1137
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:15,620
like battlefield or call of duty not 
really conducive to vr right now.

1138
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,640
Not yet.
Yeah.

1139
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,580
I think in the future though,
a plastic gun.

1140
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,900
Yes.
Like a real.

1141
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:23,870
If you were holding a real plastic,
you'd need that interface.

1142
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:24,763
Yeah.
That would be fucking amazing for a 

1143
00:52:25,581 --> 00:52:26,720
shooter game.
Yeah.

1144
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,643
Yeah.
There's a few other ideas that they're 

1145
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:31,154
working on that should be available 
pretty relatively soon where the system 

1146
00:52:36,231 --> 00:52:38,110
maps your house,
like the room you're,

1147
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,240
you're in off of your headset and will 
superimpose things over the couch.

1148
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,990
Like it'll be a ammo crate.
A chair turns into a box ammo crate.

1149
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,310
So as you walk around the room,
uh,

1150
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,950
it's reading your room,
but making this vr world that looks more

1151
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:57,890
military or like a jungle or whatever it
is,

1152
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:00,620
so it won't be a couch,
you'll hit it,

1153
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,760
but in your vision it'll be a box or an 
ammo crate or you know,

1154
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:06,560
what a car,
something like that.

1155
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:07,394
So,
uh,

1156
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,850
that's kind of cool.
Uh,

1157
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,240
utilizing,
uh,

1158
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,610
the real environment around you and then
superimposing shit over it.

1159
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,080
You know,
what else is really cool?

1160
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:16,840
The boxing games.
Yeah.

1161
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,760
And the boxing games,
you get a crazy workout,

1162
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:24,200
you get a real legit workout because 
you're actually fake boxing this cartoon

1163
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,010
character.
And when you get

1164
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,900
hit you see a bright white flash like,

1165
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,910
like you got.
Yeah,

1166
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:34,110
like you got hit like you got your Bell 
Rung You,

1167
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:37,120
but you get,
you get a real workout when you're doing

1168
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:37,760
this.
So yeah,

1169
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,800
breath.
I've watched,

1170
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:39,390
uh,
my,

1171
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:44,080
my girl plays that and it's hilarious.
It's funny to watch people do Vr,

1172
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,180
especially stuff like that because 
they're ducking.

1173
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,163
There's another shooter game that she 
was playing and it's hilarious because 

1174
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:51,124
she's screaming and ducking down and 
your hand is up like pulling a trigger 

1175
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:58,030
on a fake gun over something that isn't 
even there.

1176
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,570
So it's,
it's cool to watch people play.

1177
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,120
It was some crazy Zombie game that my 
kids play.

1178
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,140
It's like you get a bunch of guns and 
ammo and then the zombies are closing in

1179
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:08,861
on.
You got a gun.

1180
00:54:08,861 --> 00:54:09,780
I'm down.
Yeah.

1181
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:10,870
Yeah.
This is weird.

1182
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,733
I'll tell you,
there are some games or experiences 

1183
00:54:13,991 --> 00:54:14,824
where you're walking through a kind of a
haunted house thing that are genuinely 

1184
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,730
fucking alarming.

1185
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,400
Yeah.
Like,

1186
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,600
like you don't want to,
you don't want to go around a corner,

1187
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,580
you don't want to do anything and you 
know,

1188
00:54:24,581 --> 00:54:28,240
like when you watch on the Monitor,
it's just the Monitor.

1189
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:32,530
There's shit behind you that you're not 
seeing unless you turn around and look.

1190
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,320
So you hear a sound and be like,
I am not to.

1191
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:37,510
I don't want to turn around.
I know that thing's going to be right in

1192
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:42,511
my face and it's frightening.
What is the alien game for?

1193
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:46,810
Is that for the vibe or.
Oculus is a Ridley Scott Alien.

1194
00:54:46,811 --> 00:54:48,360
Yeah,
that's the.

1195
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,070
I think it's both because I had it for 
Oculus.

1196
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:54,130
It's fucking terrifying.
Alien something.

1197
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,410
Yeah.
It's the one like alien.

1198
00:54:56,411 --> 00:54:57,860
The original movie.
Yeah.

1199
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:58,810
Yeah.
You're on a ship.

1200
00:54:58,830 --> 00:54:59,663
It's a,
it starts with the doors open up and 

1201
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:02,950
that little thing,
drinking of the water.

1202
00:55:02,951 --> 00:55:04,390
That little chotchkies on the,
uh,

1203
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,740
on the task and it's A.
Yeah,

1204
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,390
it really gives a good to a recreation 
of the,

1205
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,250
of the movie,
which was fucking awesome.

1206
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,190
That's one of the greatest one goes down
as one of my

1207
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:19,220
favorite scene is also one of my 
favorite examples when people talk about

1208
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:21,760
pushing diversity and movies.
Oh yeah.

1209
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,213
This movie had a female lead who is a 
female superstar who a spoiler alert 

1210
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:34,100
winds up winning in the end,
but you don't need even notice now.

1211
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,150
It never feels like it's crammed down 
your throat.

1212
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,920
Right.
As the last star wars,

1213
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,170
it was like,
get the fuck out of here,

1214
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:43,540
Laura dern.
You're not running the empire here.

1215
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,970
You're like,
what is this?

1216
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:45,804
Like?
She's the head General and then Carrie 

1217
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,920
Fisher's the other head general,
and I'm telling these men to shut up and

1218
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:52,470
this all makes sense to you.
Is in that fucking amazing.

1219
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,173
They had a,
that was 1979 and they had more of an 

1220
00:55:58,671 --> 00:56:01,400
idea of how to present that then.
Uh,

1221
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:01,920
yeah.

1222
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,753
First of all,
sigourney weaver's just a fucking bad 

1223
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,680
ass believable movies.
Believe that she pulled it together.

1224
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:11,610
She was such a great actress.
So that's alien if this ascent,

1225
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:12,240
like,

1226
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,740
that thing that you did at Disney 
though.

1227
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,853
Oh,
go to free roaming vr came out earlier 

1228
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,093
this year in orange,
California and exactly that would jamie 

1229
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:24,000
and I talked about that many times.
Like

1230
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,600
that's the future,
like a warehouse,

1231
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:26,434
like this space out here,
but converted into a giant vr 

1232
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:30,430
experience.
Yeah.

1233
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:34,850
Yeah.
Whereas Orange California on from here,

1234
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:40,330
look at that and we need to go to him.
When I first saw alien,

1235
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,040
I'm back.
Uh,

1236
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,120
you know,
kids.

1237
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,310
I saw it in the movie theater when it 
first came out there,

1238
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,260
kids sat.
My mom took me.

1239
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,320
It was 79.
Yeah.

1240
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,460
Yeah.
And it was a leap.

1241
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,450
It was just one of those movies that at 
the time everyone goes,

1242
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,650
oh my God,
you got to see this,

1243
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:58,060
that the chest fucking burst scene just 
slayed people.

1244
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,710
Uh,
but yeah,

1245
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,290
w w when you watch them that,
because traditional movies,

1246
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:05,920
the guys the hero and that's what 
happens when Tom Skerritt gets it.

1247
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,660
You're just like,
wait,

1248
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:11,130
why are they just killed the star,
the hero that was,

1249
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:12,340
it was Tom Skerritt.
Yeah.

1250
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,950
As like not his bucket moves a big movie
star.

1251
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:15,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

1252
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,713
And then I think it was like the first 
movie where the spaceship was kind of a 

1253
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:23,254
truck and it was just dirty and just 
regular guys concerned about getting 

1254
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:29,080
paid and,
and shit like that.

1255
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:29,914
So,
uh,

1256
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,200
yeah,
that's why it was amazing.

1257
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:37,201
Which is this one?
This is a covenant in Utero that came up

1258
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,280
a year or two ago.
Cool.

1259
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,380
Oh,
so this is after the covenant movie,

1260
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:44,860
which is a fucking awesome one.
That's recent one.

1261
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:48,820
I love movies I love.
They're so good.

1262
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,680
I like that shit.
That movie.

1263
00:57:50,681 --> 00:57:53,200
They nailed it.
It was just great.

1264
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,710
It didn't matter if a woman was running 
and it was,

1265
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,370
they weren't shoving it down your 
throat.

1266
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,233
No.
Whereas I felt like that last star wars 

1267
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:02,170
one with Laura Dern and Carrie Fisher 
was like flying,

1268
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,500
flying.
Carrie Fisher.

1269
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,330
Come on.
Yeah,

1270
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,540
I stopped.
I wasn't feeling it.

1271
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,150
I didn't feel like they were.
Look,

1272
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,400
there's certain women like,
um,

1273
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,380
what is her name from house of cards?
The,

1274
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,810
the,
the head woman Watson.

1275
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:23,200
Jenny from Jenny from Sean Penn.

1276
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,980
Penn.
So it's something,

1277
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,550
something,
something Penn fuck's her name.

1278
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:33,240
I think she used that to.
I'm embarraSsed,

1279
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,600
right robin?
Round robin,

1280
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,280
right?
Robin wright.

1281
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:38,500
Okay.
Robin wright was playing a general.

1282
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,590
I believe it.
Yeah,

1283
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,990
bitch.
Right.

1284
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:43,270
She could,
she could send in some fucking tanks,

1285
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,313
I believe.
I believe that she would like the 

1286
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,800
planet.
I'd buy that.

1287
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,190
Right.
But uh,

1288
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,640
carrie fisher and laura dern,
I was like,

1289
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:52,540
come on,
I see what you're doing.

1290
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,580
They're running things.
I,

1291
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,070
I think they've,
uh,

1292
00:58:56,071 --> 00:58:56,904
they just,
they're putting out too many star wars 

1293
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:03,451
movies to have that mystique and that 
kind of a atmosphere that it was like to

1294
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:06,460
go to one of them years ago.
It's also,

1295
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,860
it's,
it's disney now.

1296
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:09,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

1297
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,730
Which is great because it's consistent 
and it's good.

1298
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,670
Right.
But it's never stunning.

1299
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,160
It's terrifying.
It's never.

1300
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,730
It's never x mokena.
Right,

1301
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:21,210
right.
Yeah.

1302
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,550
Yeah.
it's never fucked up.

1303
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,040
Like when you leave the theater going,
holy shit.

1304
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:25,820
Yeah,
yeah.

1305
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,653
Can't do that anymore.
They kind of polish off the sharp edges 

1306
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:34,421
and sued the experience down to a 
palatable mainstream appeal that first,

1307
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,270
the first star wars back in [inaudible] 
77 again.

1308
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:42,710
I saw that in a movie theater with my 
uncle.

1309
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:46,580
My uncle joe took me and I didn't know 
stores from a home of wall.

1310
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:48,740
I remember the trailer playing on tv and
I was like,

1311
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,000
all right,
that seems kind of cool.

1312
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,223
Uh,
and then we sit down and that opening 

1313
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:57,170
scene with the giant ship just does a 
fly over.

1314
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,570
And I was just,
from that point on,

1315
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:00,404
I was just mesmerized with this.
The illusion of size that they got in 

1316
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:04,214
the ship and it was an old school ship.
The added out of like plastic model of 

1317
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:12,650
practical effects.
It was all like models,

1318
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,630
like they went and bought like a bunch 
of different.

1319
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,010
You remember those old bottles that we 
used to do like cars and oem.

1320
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,190
Remember those glue them together.
You get the bottle glue,

1321
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:23,540
rIght?
I used to love those.

1322
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,433
Yeah.
They took a bunch of parts from those 

1323
01:00:26,091 --> 01:00:26,924
things and built the millennium falcon.
They built those battleships from like 

1324
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:31,724
parts and you can kind of tell because 
they're so weird and eclectic and some 

1325
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:38,770
of the parts don't seem to match.
Worked.

1326
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,060
It totally worked.
Yeah.

1327
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,230
That was a.
You know,

1328
01:00:42,231 --> 01:00:44,980
if you.
You didn't imagine being in a,

1329
01:00:44,981 --> 01:00:46,910
in one of those x wing fighters as a 
kid,

1330
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:50,120
it was just an amazing thing that's 
kinda gone.

1331
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:54,630
It shows you how great alien like ridley
scott alien really was because all those

1332
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,530
star wars was a great movie.
Honestly,

1333
01:00:57,531 --> 01:01:01,940
star wars doesn't really hold up 
[inaudible] like if you watch it today,

1334
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:03,800
you look at the special effects,
like what?

1335
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:08,770
What am I watching this clunky and,
and then the catena scenes and I that.

1336
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:09,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

1337
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:10,363
That's always.
The mouths don't move like the monster 

1338
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,393
phases.
Like,

1339
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,710
it's weird if they're wearing a mask,
it's really obvious,

1340
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:22,730
but then you go just two yeaRs later to 
ridley scott alien,

1341
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,760
that motherfucker holds up today.
It looks amazing.

1342
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:26,594
You know,
I got yelled at because I've watched it 

1343
01:01:27,621 --> 01:01:32,180
with my kids because my 10 year old can 
handle shit.

1344
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:34,640
My eight year old cannot.
Oh man,

1345
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:35,840
I,
I watched it.

1346
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:37,010
I'm like,
you think you can handle it?

1347
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:37,730
And they'Re like,
yeah,

1348
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:38,950
I can handle it.
okay.

1349
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:43,880
I'm going to die the first time.
The dude got the tongue to the forehead.

1350
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,760
What?
Watching daddy night maRes bill.

1351
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:54,240
Remember that?
Yeah,

1352
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,250
my dad,
my mom and my dad took me,

1353
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,443
my brother and my sister when I was 
seven years old to go see bonnie and 

1354
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:06,980
clyde with a warren beatty.
And uh,

1355
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:07,814
what's her name there?
I can't remember who played by faye 

1356
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:12,080
dunaway.
Very good.

1357
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,040
Thank you.
Yes.

1358
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:14,263
And uh,
now it's famous for being one of the 

1359
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:20,160
most graphic

1360
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:24,150
machine gunning at the end of the movie.
I mean they were pulling up.

1361
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:24,984
They got ambushed by law and uh,
they just get shot up the whole movie 

1362
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:33,240
though as a seven year old kid.
I liked these people.

1363
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,940
They were funny.
They've robbed banks and stuff,

1364
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:36,774
but you know,
they,

1365
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:40,500
they'd make jokes and they were coal and
you've got to know him as a person.

1366
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:42,540
So as a seven year old I was like,
oh,

1367
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:44,220
these,
these people are cool.

1368
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,073
So then the end of the movie comes and,
and they're out there and you hear the 

1369
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:53,130
birds fly away and clyde looks at 
bonnie,

1370
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,821
uh,
with,

1371
01:02:53,821 --> 01:02:55,420
uh,
one lens missing from his,

1372
01:02:55,421 --> 01:02:59,520
his glasses and it's really quiet and 
then all hell breaks loose.

1373
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,383
It's just five guys shooting thompson's 
at both of them and they're being 

1374
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:05,604
riddled with bullet holes and the scene 
goes on and they're falling down and 

1375
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:10,980
against the car.

1376
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,360
The car is just full.
Yeah,

1377
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,030
there it is.
It's,

1378
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,240
it's so brutal.
It's crazy to seeing the girl get it.

1379
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,163
Oh yeah.
Something ruthless about seeing a girl 

1380
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:22,470
gets shot a hundred times.
Yeah.

1381
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:23,670
Yeah.
Look at her.

1382
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,800
It was,
I,

1383
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:30,420
I'm that.
We saw this at the drive in and uh,

1384
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,123
I,
I started vomiting in the car seven 

1385
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:36,750
years old.
We had,

1386
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,300
we had been to arby's before,
so,

1387
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:42,270
uh,
my rbs was all over the car.

1388
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,060
I was screaming,
crying and throwing up,

1389
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:46,463
going like,
what the fuck did you take me to say I 

1390
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:49,794
liked these people.
I had like a to our relationship with 

1391
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:55,920
them and it ends like that.
I was horrified.

1392
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,300
Horrified.
As a kid.

1393
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,590
Yeah.
There's certain things,

1394
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,693
but is that bad?
Like ultimately you saw that when you 

1395
01:04:02,911 --> 01:04:03,810
weRe a kid,
like maybe,

1396
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,530
maybe it's maybe it's not good to shield
kids from too much.

1397
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:09,143
Maybe not to that extent.
Show me a cartoon first or something 

1398
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,390
because I dunno,
I dunno if it affected me.

1399
01:04:15,391 --> 01:04:16,224
It's hard to tell Without knowing what 
it would be like if I didn't see stuff 

1400
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:19,650
like that.
Uh,

1401
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:24,270
but the fact that I remember it vividly 
so many years later

1402
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,000
maybe had an effect,
but yeah,

1403
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:26,834
but it isn't a negative effect.
There's certain experiences that you 

1404
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,180
want,
you can have,

1405
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,013
like today as an adult,
you could see a movie where a guy gets 

1406
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:37,850
shot and you can handle.
It dOesn't freak you out.

1407
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,560
Of course,
if you saw it when you were four,

1408
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:41,120
you'd probably freak out.
Yeah.

1409
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,300
But is it good to expeRience that when 
you're four just so that you know,

1410
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:45,134
it's a thing and you have a different 
view of the world or is it good like 

1411
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,270
you're not a parent,
but as a parent,

1412
01:04:50,271 --> 01:04:51,104
this is the age old question.
Like hoW much do you protect your kids 

1413
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,340
and how much do you let them break their
arm?

1414
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:57,440
Because you break your arm,
you know,

1415
01:04:57,441 --> 01:04:58,550
if you fall,
you break your arm.

1416
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,250
If everybody's like helicopter 
parenting,

1417
01:05:01,251 --> 01:05:03,350
you constantly like,
I don't want anybody to die,

1418
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:05,510
but I don't mind if anybody gets banged 
up a little bit.

1419
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:06,471
Right.
Thank you.

1420
01:05:06,471 --> 01:05:08,930
Should I think you should know that if 
you trip it hurts.

1421
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:11,360
You know there's.
And there's also,

1422
01:05:11,361 --> 01:05:15,350
you should know that bullets are real.
This is a real thing that happens.

1423
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,543
like with my kids,
ever since my kids have been really 

1424
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:21,364
little,
I've been hunting and so I've been 

1425
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:23,674
bringing home meat and explaining to 
them that this is meat from an animal 

1426
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:30,160
that I shot.
If you go to the supermarket and you buy

1427
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:34,600
a steak that came from an animal and I 
try to get this in their head at a early

1428
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:35,434
age,
so then I introduced them to watching a 

1429
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:42,670
hunting show with me where we shot a 
deer and then took the deer apart.

1430
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:46,770
Polshek shake you seeing like they're 
watching us cut an elca part.

1431
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:50,740
My kids watching this and I'm like,
well this is where you get meat.

1432
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:52,840
Like when we eat dinner,
if we eat elk for dinner,

1433
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:56,170
this is exactly where it came from.
I shot it in the mountains.

1434
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:59,110
We cut it up.
We packed it out on our back.

1435
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:02,350
We put it into a truck.
We drove somewhere and now we're here.

1436
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:03,820
Now we're eating it.
This is a.

1437
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:05,950
Yeah.
I guess if you present it like that,

1438
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,940
that's I would guess is a good thing 
maybe.

1439
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:10,803
But there's something weird about 
watching a little kid watching animal 

1440
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:15,550
gets shot where like,
uh,

1441
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:16,483
yeah,
they realized my dad and that is that 

1442
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:19,390
good?
Is my debt a piece of shit?

1443
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,860
These animals are so beautiful.
Well,

1444
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:24,723
animals aRe hot dog.
Your hot dogs a fucking that you want a 

1445
01:06:26,261 --> 01:06:26,981
hot dog,
right?

1446
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:27,701
Yeah.
Yeah.

1447
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:29,710
And that'S an animal like,
okay.

1448
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,230
Like,
because most kids just,

1449
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,430
it's a hot dog.
It's the.

1450
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,080
Yeah.
It's not an actual animal.

1451
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:38,410
They kind of know,
like if you asked a little kid,

1452
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,150
hey,
we're this cheeseburger came from,

1453
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,790
oh it's from a cow.
But that's like,

1454
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:46,180
damn.
That's like saying the moon is a one,

1455
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:48,160
six earth's gravity.
I know that.

1456
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:49,850
I don't know what the fuck that means.
Yeah,

1457
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:50,610
yeah,
yeah.

1458
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,443
No real.
I don't have a real chance apply it to 

1459
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:55,240
anything.
so yeah.

1460
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:57,430
So when do you show your kids?
Like,

1461
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,150
like there's a lot of videos that I 
watch while close my laptop and the kids

1462
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:03,040
come in,
they're like violent videos.

1463
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:04,450
So yeah,
especially like animals.

1464
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,260
Like I was watching this video of these 
hyenas tearing apart this gazelle.

1465
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,780
Oh,
fucking horrific.

1466
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:12,160
the ripping the guts out.
Oh,

1467
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:13,503
yanking on the guts and this thing is 
making these weird noises like home and 

1468
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:20,860
chunks of its guts out.
Oh my god,

1469
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,290
fuck,
fuck.

1470
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:24,280
And then my,
you know,

1471
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:26,110
my lIttle girl comes over and slammed it
and she's like,

1472
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:26,944
what are you watching?
And I'm watching the hyena rip apart 

1473
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,370
gazelles guts.
She's like,

1474
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:30,791
oh,
okay.

1475
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:31,660
I don't want to say all right.
Yeah,

1476
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,550
yeah,
yeah.

1477
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:34,600
So,
but,

1478
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:39,630
but kind of what's the difference 
between that and showing you hunting?

1479
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:41,980
like is there a.
I'm doing a quick.

1480
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:46,000
That's one difference.
When I shoot an animal,

1481
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,850
if I shoot an animal with a bow,
it's dead in seconds.

1482
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:49,710
Yeah.
You know,

1483
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:52,060
with a well placed shot,
it's not going anywhere.

1484
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:52,923
It's like the last elk I shot,
that one that's right out there on the 

1485
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:58,420
floor in front of the werewolf.
That thing died in five yards,

1486
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,300
five yards,
tipped over,

1487
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,360
feet up in the air,
got shot.

1488
01:08:02,361 --> 01:08:05,650
Her rIght in the heart was perfect shot.
So it was,

1489
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,790
it was almost instantaneous death.
Yes,

1490
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:12,850
it might've lived 15,
20 seconds and that was it.

1491
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,290
People.
Uh,

1492
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:16,040
I don't.
People don't seem

1493
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,873
to be shocked that much anymore.
I know you're trying to keep it from 

1494
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:22,700
your kids and things like that obviously
makes sense,

1495
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:27,701
but it's almost impossible to keep some 
really horrific shit from people,

1496
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,110
especially if you give your kid a phone.
Yeah,

1497
01:08:30,111 --> 01:08:30,944
yeah.
You're giving them access to a lot of 

1498
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:37,511
nasty stuff.
And like I remember when I was a kid,

1499
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:40,070
the,
the big thing was like faces of death.

1500
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:42,680
You want to go get faces a death man,
we'll watch it.

1501
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:43,514
It's crazy guys.
They beat up a monkey and cut his head 

1502
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:47,660
off and eat the brains and everything.
I'm like,

1503
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,130
yeah,
that's kind of fake.

1504
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:49,964
And you could tell the stage things and 
I think the only real stuff was a like 

1505
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:57,800
news footage of airline disasters and 
accidents.

1506
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,690
And so that was one that was real where 
these,

1507
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:01,880
uh,
these guys,

1508
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:02,763
uh,
somewhere in the middle east tied these 

1509
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:08,930
guys arms to one car and his legs to it 
and they pulled them apart.

1510
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,880
I cannot watch that shit.
It's terrible.

1511
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:14,773
And now in stunning hd,
you can see in a snuff films years ago 

1512
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,310
was kind of an urban myth,
you know,

1513
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,700
it was a thing,
now they're readily available to anybody

1514
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:26,923
in a matter of seconds and I don't know 
what kind of effect that has on people 

1515
01:09:31,191 --> 01:09:32,570
and,
and maybe society.

1516
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:33,404
But uh,
and there's really nothIng you could do 

1517
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:39,080
pandora's out.
So I think it's affecting people though.

1518
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,110
Oh,
it's definitely sensitizing.

1519
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,890
That's the argument about video games as
well,

1520
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:43,610
right?
yeah.

1521
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:46,730
We're seeing so much violence in 
committing violence in video games.

1522
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:47,630
Like,
uh,

1523
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,790
jamie,
what was that video game where,

1524
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:51,710
uh,
the guy got in trouble because he made a

1525
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:56,711
video of him torturing some as in 
redmond he punched,

1526
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,323
he punched a.
I'm a woman in the face that was a 

1527
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,160
pRotesting for,
um,

1528
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,860
women's rights,
women's rights to vote suffrage.

1529
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,143
And uh,
and he got in trouBle because he posted 

1530
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:12,014
it and it,
yeah,

1531
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,490
it was like a violent thing against 
women.

1532
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,800
But it's a thing you can do in the game,
right?

1533
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,130
Like they made it in the game.
So you Could do that on purpose.

1534
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:19,993
And once it became viral,
people started going up to her in the 

1535
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:24,164
game and doing even more terrible than 
there's one where a guy ropes her hog 

1536
01:10:27,441 --> 01:10:29,060
ties or throws her on the back oF the 
horse,

1537
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:34,900
rides her to a swamp and throws her to 
an aLligator which then eats her and the

1538
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:37,340
swamp.
That is so crazy that you can do that.

1539
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,370
If the allegation unbelievable the 
alligator will eat.

1540
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:41,990
And it's not even a thing like,
hey,

1541
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:42,824
do this.
It's just part of the game that they 

1542
01:10:44,781 --> 01:10:45,171
said,
well,

1543
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:47,870
if people want to do it,
It's a very open ended game.

1544
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:50,840
Rockstar went bullshit with this game.
It's amazing.

1545
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,330
Does,
does it always happen the exact same way

1546
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:58,070
or do you throw rocks in the water and 
the alligator has a different way of.

1547
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:58,963
Yeah,
there are different animations for the 

1548
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,640
same thing.
So,

1549
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,710
and different.
Actually there was one,

1550
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,573
uh,
you'll be riding next to a guy that 

1551
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:09,190
you're supposed to ride somewhere with.
And I'm,

1552
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:11,420
the guy says something like,
all right,

1553
01:11:11,421 --> 01:11:13,400
we're almost there or something.
And,

1554
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:16,470
and if you're far away from the guy,
he yells it,

1555
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,030
alright,
we're almost there.

1556
01:11:18,031 --> 01:11:19,110
And if he's right next to you,
he goes,

1557
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,150
well,
we're almost there like the guy,

1558
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:21,984
the voice actor,
how to do a shitload of takes based on 

1559
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:30,480
what the animation is.
So I did the voiceover for the ufc game,

1560
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,620
right.
Took for ever forever.

1561
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:39,621
You're there for days and days and days,
readIng every single variation of a head

1562
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:41,394
kick to an arm bar to a take down to 
ground and pound to tko stoppage to 

1563
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,080
kicking someone in the nuts like 
everything.

1564
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:52,200
and someone's got to fucking put that 
together.

1565
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:55,320
And then it's got to be coded where it 
plays at the right time.

1566
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,860
It really is amazing.
Yeah,

1567
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,240
it's god damn amazing.
I,

1568
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:02,000
um,
but red,

1569
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,890
red dead's like really insane.
Is this it?

1570
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:06,420
There's a,
what is this?

1571
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:07,070
This is the.
Yeah,

1572
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:09,870
this is a guy.
Oh,

1573
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:14,871
this guy just smoking a cigar.
So it's so funny.

1574
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:19,020
The things that go on in this game,
the ability to kill people.

1575
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,960
I had a Louis J.
Gomez on the show and he,

1576
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,930
he plays this and uh,
he,

1577
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:28,350
there's like a morality direction you 
could take.

1578
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:30,690
You could either be a good guy or bad 
guy,

1579
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:32,370
really good,
really bad,

1580
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,080
and it will affect how the course of the
game and and whether you're wanted,

1581
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:39,190
whether people are nice to you.
Real.

1582
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,103
Yeah.
Yeah.

1583
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:40,943
Like you could do a favor for somebody.
You'd be riding somewhere and someone 

1584
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:43,981
will go,
please,

1585
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:44,840
could you help me ouT?

1586
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,190
Just a women's rights activist.
Not hurt,

1587
01:12:47,191 --> 01:12:48,024
but he's going to throw this lady off of
the mountain and this is just some guy 

1588
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:55,290
online has done this.
This is the same youtube he does.

1589
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,210
He's got a lot of videos.
Oh jeez.

1590
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,070
He fell.
He fell.

1591
01:12:59,160 --> 01:12:59,993
He fell himself.
He was trying to kick her off and oh ha 

1592
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:02,904
ha.
But a and louis apparently would kill 

1593
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:06,264
everybody.
He killed a guy's dog and skinned it in 

1594
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:12,000
front of him and then shot him in the 
face.

1595
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,890
Like,
that's really neat.

1596
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:15,143
That's really neat.
Dog in front of the guy and the guy's 

1597
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,490
just like crying.
It's brutal.

1598
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,940
I mean,
do you thInk that most politicians,

1599
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,550
are those people looking for outrageous?
Just not aware of this yet?

1600
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,020
yeah,
absolutely.

1601
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:29,700
Not.
Years ago they were kind of like,

1602
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:31,410
well,
this must be violent video games,

1603
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,950
and it was so funny because like 10 
years after doom,

1604
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,110
like they're showing doom on tv.

1605
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:37,441
Like,
oh,

1606
01:13:37,441 --> 01:13:38,940
that's the bad video game.
I was like,

1607
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,170
jesus christ,
that's nothing.

1608
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,600
What are you talking about?
And now like,

1609
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:44,240
uh,
like I said at datto,

1610
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:45,750
same guys.
Yeah.

1611
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:46,680
Yeah.
joe gta.

1612
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,580
I did some of the voices in gta five.
It was fucking hilarious.

1613
01:13:50,581 --> 01:13:51,414
So I know.
Yeah,

1614
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,250
to do that.
I sang some of the uh,

1615
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,580
promotional songs for the beer piss 
watser beer.

1616
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,440
It was great.
I know laszlo,

1617
01:13:58,441 --> 01:13:59,780
who does all the sound for the,
uh,

1618
01:13:59,781 --> 01:14:01,350
the games.
But uh,

1619
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:02,363
this thing sold like $750,
million dollars in the first three days 

1620
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,720
that came out.
What happens if you bring a black man to

1621
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:12,790
the kkk?
They have fucking kkk,

1622
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:15,040
rally planned,
rally going on and there's a part of the

1623
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:15,874
game where you have to infiltrate what 
happens when you bring a black guy at 

1624
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:21,920
different happened really the clan,
they don't freak out.

1625
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:23,110
Not,
not in particular,

1626
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,160
but the job.
I think the mission here is to just kill

1627
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:27,994
all the klan guys.
It's not like you join up and I'll have 

1628
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:31,024
a good time.
It would be more realistic is if you 

1629
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:37,240
brought a black guy to the clan,
mean they tried to kill the black guy.

1630
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,110
Right?
Right.

1631
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:40,690
But that would be real.
That would be crazy.

1632
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,733
There are some weird parts in it where 
they're very misogynistic because it's 

1633
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:49,180
supposed to be like 1899 or something 
and it's very misogynistic.

1634
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:52,570
And then there's some race references 
that they make that are kind of like,

1635
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,560
oof,
oof.

1636
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,120
wow.
That's bold.

1637
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,210
Like what,
what do they say about black guy?

1638
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,670
Like they'll call them boy in some of 
the,

1639
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:01,441
uh,
when,

1640
01:15:01,441 --> 01:15:02,274
when a guy like a non player character 
will pass by and be kind of nasty and 

1641
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,230
uh,
they never presented in a good way.

1642
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,081
It's not like,
you know,

1643
01:15:09,081 --> 01:15:09,611
oh,
cool,

1644
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:10,780
this guy's great.
Uh,

1645
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,880
it's always some scumbag.
A character.

1646
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,150
Yeah.
I love him.

1647
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:18,210
It's like the last frontier for chaos 
right now.

1648
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,210
Yeah,
it really is.

1649
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:20,044
And I think because there's such a lack 
of awareness on the part of a lot of 

1650
01:15:23,831 --> 01:15:24,670
people,
like I,

1651
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:29,380
I get games the day they come and 
actually before I get alpha testing,

1652
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:32,710
beta testing,
I'm playing the games months before they

1653
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:33,430
come out.
Really?

1654
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:34,263
Yeah.
I love it.

1655
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,790
I get it on that.
Uh,

1656
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:39,010
you sign up for a,
uh,

1657
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:39,963
the ultimate package on origin or steam 
and you get access to the games when 

1658
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:45,820
they,
when they're testing them.

1659
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:47,110
Mostly just pay.
Yeah.

1660
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:48,010
Yeah.
It's a pay thing.

1661
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:51,010
Obviously they want to make some,
some money and I want to play.

1662
01:15:51,011 --> 01:15:54,430
The games are really busting your report
bugs and things on.

1663
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:55,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

1664
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,093
If you just play,
they automatically kind of have 

1665
01:15:58,451 --> 01:15:59,284
something in place that will let them 
know if there's a problem or you can 

1666
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,170
email them and say,
hey there,

1667
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,520
you know,
I died and I'm stuck in a rock now up to

1668
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:07,354
my waist.

1669
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,500
Have you ever talked to some of the 
people that make those things?

1670
01:16:09,501 --> 01:16:12,940
Do you ever have them on your show?
Laszlo works at rockstar.

1671
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,910
He's a sound engineer guy.
He records all the sound,

1672
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:16,744
but he's involved in every aspect of all
those games from the beginning of grand 

1673
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:23,740
theft auto,
the first red dead redemption two.

1674
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,420
Um,
and uh,

1675
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,283
it's amazing.
I've been to rockstar in New York and 

1676
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:33,540
took a tour of the place and it's just a
bunch of fucking nerds sitting around.

1677
01:16:33,701 --> 01:16:34,700
They have a day where,
you know,

1678
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,080
you can bring your dogs in and it's all 
wide open.

1679
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:38,943
No cubicles or anything.
The guys that run it are these english 

1680
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:45,190
guys and they're brilliant or New 
Zealand or something.

1681
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,533
They have that accent sense.
One of those weird accents that you 

1682
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:51,520
can't tell where it's from work insane 
hours.

1683
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,480
Yeah,
that's it.

1684
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,930
They are dedicated like a game,
like,

1685
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:58,660
like a rockstar game,
gta or that.

1686
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:02,720
It's so above other games,
like,

1687
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:03,563
like you can't even.
I played some shitty games where I 

1688
01:17:06,281 --> 01:17:07,114
download it.
I stopped playing and within five 

1689
01:17:08,381 --> 01:17:09,620
minutes I'm like,
fuck,

1690
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:11,210
this sucks.
Like it just,

1691
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:12,320
you know,
it sucks.

1692
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,810
Right.
And rockstar games or just,

1693
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:16,280
you know,
it sounds like I'm doing a spot for him,

1694
01:17:16,281 --> 01:17:19,370
but uh,
they're so above everything else.

1695
01:17:19,371 --> 01:17:20,600
The animation,
the,

1696
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:21,813
the sandbox quality where you're able to
just run around and do shit like that's 

1697
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:26,444
an appeal that I don't like feeling like
they're on a track in a game and a 

1698
01:17:30,531 --> 01:17:35,531
certain games are like that,
like a call of duty is very track based,

1699
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:36,824
you know,
you play online a lot against other 

1700
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,010
people.
They're small maps,

1701
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,430
but a game like that you could just go 
off if you want to.

1702
01:17:43,431 --> 01:17:47,840
You could just spend time fishing.
Like you could just get tackle and go to

1703
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:49,880
a lake and fish and catch fish.

1704
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,070
You catch fish.
It's a.

1705
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:52,904
Yeah,
you can just spend eight hours just 

1706
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:55,430
catching fish,
just fishing,

1707
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:56,810
hunting.
You could go out and hunt.

1708
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,270
I've heard that you track like the bear 
and,

1709
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,370
and that motherfucker can you saw like 
can get you a.

1710
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:04,790
I love games like that though.
I love open ended games.

1711
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,650
I always liked that shit.
Even when I was um,

1712
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,660
back in the eighties,
uh,

1713
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,513
my cousin got a atari 800 computer and 
it had a cartridge for a game called 

1714
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:17,203
star raiders.
And this was right after star wars came 

1715
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:20,474
out.
And I was fascinated because it wasn't 

1716
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:26,660
just a joystick and a button that you 
got on an arcade game,

1717
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:27,523
it was you used the keyboard like for 
warp drive or you had a dock with a 

1718
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:37,370
space station at one point and you're 
going in orbit around a planet.

1719
01:18:37,371 --> 01:18:40,340
LIke there was all these things that you
used the keyboard for.

1720
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,173
And I thought that was amazing.
Like I don't like just a running gun 

1721
01:18:43,611 --> 01:18:44,444
type thing.
I like being able to use a lot of 

1722
01:18:46,161 --> 01:18:48,470
different keys and have a lot of 
options.

1723
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,510
How much time do you spend playing video
games?

1724
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:53,840
Because I'm getting the impression it's 
insane.

1725
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:55,013
There have been days where I have a 
weekends or something where I have 

1726
01:18:57,921 --> 01:19:01,910
played from maybe 2:00
PM till 3:00

1727
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:02,990
AM,
like 12,

1728
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,640
13 hours of playing it.
It's no eating.

1729
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,261
Yeah.
Yeah.

1730
01:19:09,261 --> 01:19:10,610
I'll,
I'll eat a little snack,

1731
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,680
a little snack.
I'll order something or miss.

1732
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:14,543
You'll make something.
She's playing viDeo games like I'll be 

1733
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:18,494
playing on the computer and that's in 
front of me on the table I was talking 

1734
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,420
about in the living room.
And then on the big screen tv,

1735
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:27,500
which is in front of me on the wall,
she sitting in like a folding chair with

1736
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:31,340
a tv tray playing red dead redemption on
the xbox.

1737
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,930
So occasionally look back and go,
oh,

1738
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:36,764
you got to see this great kills a video,
a funny video of a couple engaging in 

1739
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:45,310
virtual reality and they're having sex 
and the girls blowing the guy.

1740
01:19:45,311 --> 01:19:47,630
And then the video,
joeY diaz comes in the room.

1741
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:54,800
That's hilarious.
There was a.

1742
01:19:54,801 --> 01:19:57,110
Well there is vr porn.
Have You checked that out?

1743
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:59,780
I haven't.
It's really interesting there.

1744
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:03,890
There is.
There is some that is pretty amazing.

1745
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:09,220
Like a girl Will come up like you're 
laying on your back and a girl is in the

1746
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:11,514
room.
She takes her clothes off and comes up 

1747
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:17,890
on you and gets right by your ear and 
whisper something and,

1748
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:21,270
and you hear it,
you almost feel the breath on you.

1749
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:23,710
It's that fucking crazy.
And,

1750
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:26,580
and you,
you feel like you can reach and touch,

1751
01:20:26,581 --> 01:20:27,990
but you know,
there's no one there.

1752
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:29,071
But.
And again,

1753
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:32,820
you can't even get close to showing what
it's like on a regular flat screen,

1754
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:36,090
but when you put that in,
it's a real space.

1755
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,103
It's three d and they look pretty real 
aside from the resolution difference 

1756
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:43,800
because when you,
when you magnify something that close to

1757
01:20:43,801 --> 01:20:45,810
your eyes,
the pixels get bigger too.

1758
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:50,520
So it's not quite there.
But you could see where that's going.

1759
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,520
You get that.
And one of those fucking flashlights.

1760
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:57,733
I used a really early,
really early version of the htc vive 

1761
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,720
many years ago.
duncan had one,

1762
01:21:02,721 --> 01:21:06,920
my friend duncan trussell had one in his
house and it was really pixelated and it

1763
01:21:06,921 --> 01:21:07,754
was very strange.
It was just a real simple game and it 

1764
01:21:10,251 --> 01:21:11,084
was real blocky looking.
It looked like like old doom or 

1765
01:21:13,251 --> 01:21:16,700
something like that.
But it was in complete three dimensions.

1766
01:21:16,701 --> 01:21:18,500
And so I was looking up and looking all 
around.

1767
01:21:18,501 --> 01:21:18,861
I was like,
wow,

1768
01:21:18,861 --> 01:21:19,694
this is kind of crazy.
And then I went back to his place like 

1769
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:25,740
two years later and there had been a 
gigantic leap and them.

1770
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,790
And now the leap is sort of balanced 
out.

1771
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:31,010
It's not,
it hasn't gotten that much better.

1772
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:31,120
Yeah.

1773
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,610
Right yet.
Yeah.

1774
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:33,543
There are a few games that I love 
playing on the oculus because it's like 

1775
01:21:38,921 --> 01:21:42,250
flying games are incredible.
Um,

1776
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:47,520
and if you have a Really good system 
with a duel 10,

1777
01:21:47,651 --> 01:21:48,484
80 ti I graphics cards,
one of them is insane to have and my 

1778
01:21:53,231 --> 01:21:56,660
assistant has two of them and so I could
run everything on ultrasound.

1779
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:59,420
Do you prefer videos on a computer?

1780
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,313
Yeah,
yeah,

1781
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,940
I,
I prefer a pc,

1782
01:22:01,941 --> 01:22:03,900
But I'll play on xbox and stuff.
Uh,

1783
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:05,640
it's pretty cool.
Uh,

1784
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:07,550
I'm terrible with a controller.
Yeah,

1785
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:08,384
that's the problem.
So mouse and a keyboard is so much more 

1786
01:22:09,861 --> 01:22:11,160
precise.
I got a.

1787
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,210
Yeah.
I always say I,

1788
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,760
if anyone ever argues,
I go,

1789
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:16,220
I've never missed a folder on my 
desktop.

1790
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,050
I've never gone,
oh shit,

1791
01:22:18,051 --> 01:22:21,390
I missed it.
But there's something called a,

1792
01:22:21,391 --> 01:22:22,224
an ap zim apex that you plug into an 
xbox or playstation and then plug 

1793
01:22:27,921 --> 01:22:28,754
keyboard mouse into it.
You're runnIng on xbox with a keyboard 

1794
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:33,950
and mouse.
So.

1795
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,280
And it's so good.
I destroy people,

1796
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,133
uh,
when I play on that because it's more 

1797
01:22:39,711 --> 01:22:40,544
accurate,
so much more accuracy and you're just 

1798
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,630
quick reflexes and yeah,

1799
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:49,900
from the online video game days of the 
early two thousands and the nineties,

1800
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:51,280
like it was always.

1801
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

1802
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:56,110
Mouse and keyboard was,
was It a console was for babies?

1803
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,630
They weren't good back then.
Now curious.

1804
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:01,300
He was terrible.
Yeah.

1805
01:23:01,301 --> 01:23:02,134
I,
uh,

1806
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,900
when I play some of the,
um,

1807
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:07,780
like combat flying games,
they have things now that are,

1808
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:10,510
you look like you're in the cockpit of a
plane.

1809
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:11,613
All the gauges work.
They have reflectIons of light coming 

1810
01:23:14,351 --> 01:23:16,450
through.
I mean the ground looks amazing.

1811
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:21,190
And in vr when you pull the stick back 
and turn,

1812
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,300
because I use a joy stick and throttle.
It's,

1813
01:23:23,301 --> 01:23:24,610
it's amazing.
Uh,

1814
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,473
you can look over your shoulder and now 
you're seeing your wing and the ground 

1815
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:31,420
and you're pulling back and you get 
dizzy.

1816
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:36,750
Like you get so fucking dizzy and 
crashes are startling.

1817
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,650
Like like if you lose control and you 
plow into the ground,

1818
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:45,220
you kind of jump because it's,
you're just,

1819
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:46,054
it's,
I think it's that primal part of your 

1820
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:49,540
head going,
like accepting what it's seeing.

1821
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,420
I wonder if there would be a really good
way to learn how to fly.

1822
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:53,343
I would imagine it would be that guy 
that stole that plane up in portland 

1823
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:00,750
recently slammed into the.
Yeah,

1824
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:01,783
killed himself.
He said he learned how to fly on a 

1825
01:24:03,641 --> 01:24:04,474
simulator flight simulator.
Microsoft flight simulator x is like 

1826
01:24:08,891 --> 01:24:09,724
unbelievable.
And he was doing like loop de loops in 

1827
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:12,760
the sky and shit.
He's like,

1828
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:13,594
let's see if we could do a loop.
And he was saying I'm going to kill 

1829
01:24:15,371 --> 01:24:16,060
myself,
right?

1830
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:16,691
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1831
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:17,321
He's like,
yeah,

1832
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:18,880
I think uh,
I'll do a,

1833
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:24,060
I'll try to do a loop and then knows it 
in and call it a day what a maniac.

1834
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:28,450
But the fact that he could get access 
and take off like that is kind of scary.

1835
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,740
Whoops.
We all think,

1836
01:24:29,741 --> 01:24:30,310
uh,
you know,

1837
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:31,143
everything so secure.
Then when we thought there were like 

1838
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,880
missiles on the roof of the white house 
and the pentagon and stuff,

1839
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:37,900
and then after nine,
11 and I.

1840
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:38,993
Yeah,
I guess not.

1841
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,570
Yeah,
I guess that was all bullshit.

1842
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:45,040
The actual pentagon got hit by a fucking
plane,

1843
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:49,060
although now you're going to get a lot 
of people writing this play,

1844
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:50,800
bro was.
It was a mitchell.

1845
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:52,840
Everyone knows it.
You're a gatekeeper.

1846
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,440
You're a shill,
a shill for the eu.

1847
01:24:56,441 --> 01:24:58,690
Um,
it doesn't,

1848
01:24:58,691 --> 01:24:58,960
uh,
who,

1849
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,050
who does your show?
That is a flat earth or eddie bravo.

1850
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,400
Eddie bravo.
That's it.

1851
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:05,470
I don't know if he's still a flutter.
You might've abandoned.

1852
01:25:05,471 --> 01:25:06,304
He might've moved on.
Let me think that still he thought the 

1853
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:13,030
earth is a disk.
Maybe he said,

1854
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:15,100
I think I don't want to misinterpret 
what he's saying.

1855
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:18,490
I don't want to misrepresent.
I think he was saying he doesn't know,

1856
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:19,443
but he doesn't believe nasa because it's
only someone's word over history and he 

1857
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:27,640
likes that.
He thinks it's fun.

1858
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,060
He just conspiracies.

1859
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,580
Okay,
well they are.

1860
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,290
Yeah,
they are kind of fun.

1861
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:33,243
But that flat earth one I realized I was
arguing with flat earthers on twitter 

1862
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,290
and that's when I really started going 
like,

1863
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:38,681
what,
what,

1864
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:41,080
what am I doing?
What am I doing?

1865
01:25:41,081 --> 01:25:45,160
Why am I engaging that debt is like the 
dumbest version of I know you are,

1866
01:25:45,161 --> 01:25:48,010
but what am I for the rest of time?
Yes.

1867
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:49,270
So stupid.
That argument is,

1868
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,280
it's a it,
it's crazy.

1869
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,173
I was talking,
I was arguing with somebody and then I 

1870
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:54,753
had my show to do and I'm neil degrasse 
tyson was taping his show in my studio 

1871
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:04,280
before I came on.
So he was in the lobby when I was in our

1872
01:26:04,281 --> 01:26:05,114
greenroom when,
when I was on and I started talking 

1873
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,090
about it and I go,
you know,

1874
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,800
let's get someone in here.
Maybe that might have a,

1875
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:12,410
an opinion on this.

1876
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:16,280
Neil degrasse tyson coming.
And apparently he gets shit all the time

1877
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:18,700
from flat earthers saying that it's,
you know,

1878
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:19,810
he's full of shit.
No,

1879
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:23,120
it all started off as a goof.
It had to just like everything else.

1880
01:26:23,121 --> 01:26:27,140
But it started off on four.
Chan did it like free bleeding.

1881
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:29,210
Yes,
exactly.

1882
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:32,300
Which is hilarious.
People explain that to people don't know

1883
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:33,163
free bleeding is a woMan's rights thing 
and it's a instead of using a tampon 

1884
01:26:37,581 --> 01:26:38,414
during their period or a pad,
they just bleed through their pants and 

1885
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:45,620
show it proudly that they will walk 
around bleeding and it was never real.

1886
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:50,621
It was neveR a real thing and then 
people saw it and thought it was real.

1887
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:51,763
Like they.
They put it out there for chan and 

1888
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:56,440
people actually believed and know not 
just believed it started.

1889
01:26:56,441 --> 01:26:57,910
He started doing it.
Yes.

1890
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,960
They started doing it for real.

1891
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:03,080
They turned it into something women's 
rights,

1892
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:04,183
badge of honor to have a pair of white 
pants on with a giant patch of a 

1893
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:11,930
brownish red in the center.
It's insane.

1894
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:15,020
It's crazY.
It just shows you how easily manipulated

1895
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:17,090
people are.
Things that happen like that.

1896
01:27:17,091 --> 01:27:20,450
UnfortunatelY it turned out to be goofs.
They start out as goofs.

1897
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:21,321
Yeah.
You know,

1898
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:24,710
and then they wIll listen.
We were talking about this last song was

1899
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,750
with you,
right?

1900
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:26,623
The proud boys.
Gavin off as a goof and then became 

1901
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:31,760
like,
what the money.

1902
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,740
They won't let them in Australia now if 
you've seen that.

1903
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:34,520
No,
it's,

1904
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,000
it's gotten insane.
Yeah.

1905
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,910
Like gavin is considered a,
like a war criminal at this point.

1906
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,040
Uh,
I know gavin very well.

1907
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,270
He used to be on compound media,
my,

1908
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:46,530
my network.
Um,

1909
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:47,893
and that's where the whole thing started
and just explain how it all started 

1910
01:27:52,191 --> 01:27:53,330
because people don't know.

1911
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:54,293
It's,
it's amazing when you think about it 

1912
01:27:55,341 --> 01:27:57,410
because it makes you question 
everything.

1913
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:00,190
Like how did,
how did a nazi Germany stock,

1914
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,310
was that a joke?
Was that like stalin,

1915
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,560
ism and everything?
Uh,

1916
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:05,420
in Russia.
Gavin,

1917
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:07,460
I had a show.
Very outrageous.

1918
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:09,860
Gavin is one of these.
Just a funny,

1919
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:10,993
outrageous guy.
His whole career has been based on 

1920
01:28:12,561 --> 01:28:16,000
satire and parody and lots of 
provocateur.

1921
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,140
A provocateur.
Absolutely.

1922
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:19,460
Yeah.
Loves shaking.

1923
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:21,920
People are to find out where he really.
Well,

1924
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:24,260
how he really feels and when he's 
playing games,

1925
01:28:24,261 --> 01:28:25,490
right.
It's very bLurry.

1926
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:27,860
Absolutely.
So we have a,

1927
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:29,630
we have this employee,
uh,

1928
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:31,520
ben ratner,
little kid.

1929
01:28:31,521 --> 01:28:32,354
We,
we actually hired him just because his 

1930
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:35,960
name was ratner and we wanted to call 
him rat,

1931
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:39,530
like in fast times a rent.
Why don't you turn on the camera?

1932
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,170
Uh,
so it was,

1933
01:28:41,171 --> 01:28:42,500
it was great.
Uh,

1934
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:46,100
he rat never talked about girls.

1935
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:51,310
It's like this really jewish real red 
hair kind of gangly kid.

1936
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,360
And uh,
he,

1937
01:28:54,361 --> 01:28:55,194
he liked going to broadway shows and 
things and we always questioned his 

1938
01:28:57,891 --> 01:28:58,724
sexuality and whatnot.
And gavin really started hitting on him 

1939
01:29:01,861 --> 01:29:02,880
going,
what are you doing?

1940
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:06,090
Like get laid a kid,
your age should be out there,

1941
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:09,690
you just fucking plowing through pussy.
and he's like,

1942
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,000
I'm waiting for the right girl and 
everything.

1943
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,750
So gavin would continuously goof on him.
So he,

1944
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:16,643
He would alwayS go to broadway plays.
So gavin started getting a music from 

1945
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:23,610
musicals and playing it to him like,
hey,

1946
01:29:23,611 --> 01:29:24,600
look at this,
you pussy,

1947
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:25,770
you know,
is this what you like?

1948
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:28,440
Uh,
and one of them was proud of your boy.

1949
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:31,170
It's a broadwaY,
a song from a musical,

1950
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:33,330
a disney musical,
I believe.

1951
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,070
And it's celia.
Oh,

1952
01:29:35,071 --> 01:29:38,880
proud of your boy.
It's one of those big grandiose broadway

1953
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:39,983
pieces of shit.

1954
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:43,320
Can't stand that stuff man.
I hate it.

1955
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:44,881
oh,
it is,

1956
01:29:44,881 --> 01:29:46,550
it's terrible.
Uh,

1957
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:51,830
so he goofed on about that and then said
we ought to make a club called the proud

1958
01:29:52,441 --> 01:29:56,940
boys and that way you can learn how to 
be a man and you know,

1959
01:29:56,941 --> 01:30:00,060
you,
you'll get checks and tattoos and,

1960
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,193
you know,
drink beer and hang out with guys as a 

1961
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:05,304
joke.
IT was like this parody of a men's club 

1962
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,293
and so over the top that it was like,
I think part of the way to get beaten 

1963
01:30:14,101 --> 01:30:14,934
into this gang,
this club was that you had to recite 

1964
01:30:17,431 --> 01:30:21,530
five breakfast cereals while the other 
members punched you and,

1965
01:30:21,531 --> 01:30:24,390
and they would keep punching you until 
you spit a soul.

1966
01:30:24,391 --> 01:30:25,680
Ludicrous.
So ridiculous.

1967
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:27,630
Such parody.
Uh,

1968
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:33,350
and slowly this fucking thing mutated 
into some.

1969
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,090
It got more members.
Uh,

1970
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:39,760
they started wearing one of those 
shirts,

1971
01:30:39,761 --> 01:30:43,290
the with the yellow car Piping on the 
collar and stuff.

1972
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,900
it's a specific shirt that became the 
uniform,

1973
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:46,853
perry ellis perry ellis shirts,
a specific black shirt with gold piping 

1974
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,750
and uh,
on the collar and,

1975
01:30:53,751 --> 01:30:54,310
and the,
uh,

1976
01:30:54,310 --> 01:30:57,210
the sleeves.
And that became like the uniform.

1977
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:02,880
And because it was presented as a 
chauvinist club,

1978
01:31:02,881 --> 01:31:04,590
like,
like girls are allowed,

1979
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:07,560
minorities are allowed,
it doesn't matter who you are,

1980
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:08,543
but in essence it is a guy thing and we 
will talk shit about girls and we're 

1981
01:31:13,111 --> 01:31:16,350
going to drink and get laid.
And it was just a men thing.

1982
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:19,050
So they started getting together at 
bars,

1983
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,910
you know,
in the area in manhattan.

1984
01:31:20,911 --> 01:31:21,744
And how is this organized?
It's organized through his compound 

1985
01:31:24,121 --> 01:31:26,290
media show,
the compound media show,

1986
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:29,490
his own twitter account,
and an facebook,

1987
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:34,380
which he subsequently lost.
He's persona non grata on social media,

1988
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,753
but that's how it started.
And it never was supposed to go any 

1989
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:40,554
further than that.

1990
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:44,340
Gavin himself didn't really take it any 
further than that.

1991
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:45,203
It's just,
let's get together every so often we 

1992
01:31:46,711 --> 01:31:47,880
have a good time.
We drink,

1993
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:49,050
laugh,
everything like that.

1994
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:54,530
Well then this whole thing with politics
got involved because antifa,

1995
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:57,730
which antifascist started,
uh,

1996
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,673
uh,
coming into a conservatives that wanted 

1997
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,523
to speak.
So gavin was conservative as 

1998
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:06,163
conservative.
He'd get speaking engagements at 

1999
01:32:07,841 --> 01:32:10,480
schools,
nyu or,

2000
01:32:10,481 --> 01:32:11,530
um,
any,

2001
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:11,890
any,
uh,

2002
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:12,723
numerous places around New York city and
antifa would show up to protest him and 

2003
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:17,734
try to shut down the event.
So then the proud boys would go and 

2004
01:32:21,641 --> 01:32:22,474
protect gavin so he wouldn't get harmed 
doing these speaking engagements and 

2005
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,193
that.
So then it turned into this because 

2006
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,940
they're fighting with antifa.
They must be the fall,

2007
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,880
the fascists,
nazis.

2008
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,640
Um,
and once that gets out there,

2009
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,593
there's no pulling it back.
You could try to explain how you're not 

2010
01:32:43,451 --> 01:32:45,910
a nazi till you're blue in the face.

2011
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:47,043
It ain't going away.
And especially because it's a good 

2012
01:32:49,031 --> 01:32:50,860
story.
The press likes it.

2013
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:54,110
It's this good versus evil thing.
They present antifa.

2014
01:32:54,111 --> 01:32:57,400
I like their protest.
They always call them and the protesters

2015
01:32:57,401 --> 01:32:59,470
were beaten.
Their fucking violent,

2016
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,900
violent group of people that are there 
to,

2017
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,290
to hit people they don't agree with and 
silence people that want to speak.

2018
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:06,573
And that's exactly what happened with 
gavin and ann coulter and milo 

2019
01:33:10,241 --> 01:33:11,600
yiannopoulos,
uh,

2020
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,650
a ben shapiro,
the,

2021
01:33:13,651 --> 01:33:17,230
a lot of these conservative people can't
go to these venues and speak.

2022
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:21,130
They get shut down because of a violent 
group of people called antifa.

2023
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,800
So proud boys were kind of the answer to
that.

2024
01:33:23,801 --> 01:33:26,920
So gavin can go around and actually,
uh,

2025
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:29,530
speak.
Well when that happened,

2026
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,940
more people came on board because they 
kind of liked to beat people up.

2027
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:36,970
When you have a gang,
a group of people,

2028
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,133
and one of their missions is now to beat
up people you don't agree with 

2029
01:33:41,591 --> 01:33:42,210
politically.

2030
01:33:42,210 --> 01:33:44,940
When there was there,
there's tiers to the membership.

2031
01:33:44,941 --> 01:33:45,774
Like the highest tier was you fought for
the cause to actually get into a 

2032
01:33:48,811 --> 01:33:49,680
fistfight.
Yeah.

2033
01:33:49,681 --> 01:33:51,490
Yes.
I'm sure gavin thought was like,

2034
01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:53,220
I've talked to gavin.
I'd like gavin,

2035
01:33:53,221 --> 01:33:54,054
I've had gavin on the podcasts and the 
last time I had them on I didn't know 

2036
01:33:57,121 --> 01:33:57,954
what this whole thing was.
And so he was explaining the proud boys 

2037
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:02,670
and he was talking to me about,
we're going to punch them.

2038
01:34:02,671 --> 01:34:03,900
We're going to punch people.
Yeah.

2039
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,470
I was like,
whoa,

2040
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:05,303
whoa,
whoa.

2041
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:08,460
And I was like,
did you know you can't just punch people

2042
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:09,383
like they,
they punched back and then you get mad 

2043
01:34:11,431 --> 01:34:13,530
that you punched them in and they shoot 
you when you get out of your car.

2044
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,650
This escalates.
People don't just take it.

2045
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:19,430
Well,
it was never supposed to be an offensive

2046
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,100
punching.
Uh,

2047
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:21,973
when,
when I would speak to gavin and every 

2048
01:34:23,091 --> 01:34:25,520
example I would see it was an answer to 
violence.

2049
01:34:25,521 --> 01:34:26,354
They,
they would have violence perpetrated on 

2050
01:34:27,441 --> 01:34:27,740
them.

2051
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:28,573
Proper context.
And all bald needed to say is he's 

2052
01:34:31,351 --> 01:34:32,850
calling for violence.
That's it.

2053
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,280
And that's what they've said about gavin
over and over again,

2054
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,090
taking things out of context and use it 
as a gamble.

2055
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,183
The other problem being that the antifa 
people are a lot of skinny dudes and 

2056
01:34:45,341 --> 01:34:47,770
chicks with masks on and they

2057
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,333
that adept at fighting.
There's a horrible video of this one 

2058
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:52,543
antifa guy tries to hit someone with it 
looks like some kind of a stick or a 

2059
01:34:55,401 --> 01:34:56,270
pipe.
Yeah.

2060
01:34:56,271 --> 01:34:58,610
And the guy it and fucking

2061
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:02,350
blasted him on the chin and fucking put 
him down.

2062
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,240
His head bounces off the concrete 
unconscious,

2063
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:07,340
which is a whole lot of people die.
Yeah,

2064
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:08,121
yeah,
exactly.

2065
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:09,790
That's how people die in fights like,
oh,

2066
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,930
he killed them with his bare hands.
Yeah.

2067
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:13,250
He hit his fucking head on.
He hit his head on the concrete.

2068
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:16,100
You got hit by the world.
Literally the world,

2069
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:17,193
right?
Right.

2070
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:18,870
Gravity.
The budge it.

2071
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,290
Gravity has punched you in the back of 
the head.

2072
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:25,250
So yes,
these people have this idea that they're

2073
01:35:25,251 --> 01:35:27,410
going to go places.
They're going to shut everybody down and

2074
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:28,244
because they're in a group,
you're going to scream and yell and hit 

2075
01:35:30,021 --> 01:35:32,860
people with bike locks and all this 
stuff that y'all seen.

2076
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:35,690
Weird thing is that that's from the 
left.

2077
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,270
That was never from the left before.
When I was a kid.

2078
01:35:38,271 --> 01:35:39,104
I grew up when I was eight,
from eight slash seven slash 11 during 

2079
01:35:41,571 --> 01:35:42,404
the Vietnam war.

2080
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,333
I lived in san francisco and I was 
around the real hippies and I remember 

2081
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:46,814
being a little kid.
I remember that moment of times like a 

2082
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,900
flower children.
I mean,

2083
01:35:50,901 --> 01:35:55,901
they were the hippies and the lefties 
were were love and peace and no violence

2084
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:57,823
and everyone was doing acid and now 
they're all on adderall and they're 

2085
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:03,320
hitting people with bike locks.
It was,

2086
01:36:03,321 --> 01:36:04,910
yeah,
it's a different thing.

2087
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
There was a time where the liberals,
the hippies,

2088
01:36:08,001 --> 01:36:08,840
the,
you know,

2089
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:10,123
they were the ones that when there would
be a demonstration and the national 

2090
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:16,430
guard would show up,
they'd be putting flowers in.

2091
01:36:16,431 --> 01:36:18,830
The barrels of the guns are famous 
pictures of that,

2092
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,873
and then kent state was a bunch of 
hippies literally getting shot by the 

2093
01:36:24,141 --> 01:36:24,974
national guard,
the national guard that has completely 

2094
01:36:28,101 --> 01:36:31,670
flipped around.
It's the weirdest thing and I don't know

2095
01:36:31,671 --> 01:36:33,710
how it got distinguished.

2096
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:34,543
We're proud boys became this evil group 
of people and an antifa is the good 

2097
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:41,840
group of people.
Now I understand that.

2098
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:42,703
Proud boy,
a proud boys were infiltrated by white 

2099
01:36:45,111 --> 01:36:47,090
nationalist,
nazi,

2100
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,830
white supremacist,
whatever it is,

2101
01:36:48,831 --> 01:36:51,770
but those were constantly being 
disavowed by gavin.

2102
01:36:51,771 --> 01:36:54,580
Gavin never wanted any of that 
happening,

2103
01:36:54,581 --> 01:36:56,930
but is there a way.
How do you get in though?

2104
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,610
Here's the question,
because this is my.

2105
01:36:58,611 --> 01:36:59,444
You saw my last comedy special.
This is my criticism of a vegans is not 

2106
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:06,560
that there's anything wrong with being a
vegan,

2107
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,320
is that when you have a group where 
anybody can join,

2108
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,990
you're going to get a certain amount of 
fucking idiots.

2109
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:16,210
If you have a million people for sure 
you have 100,000

2110
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:19,070
fucking idiots.
There's no getting around that.

2111
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:21,260
Yeah,
so if you have a group where anybody can

2112
01:37:21,261 --> 01:37:23,660
join and you have a million people in 
that group,

2113
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:24,563
you're going to have 100,000
fucking fucking idiots and those people 

2114
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:28,424
are going to define your group.
The worst behavior in that group is 

2115
01:37:30,561 --> 01:37:32,840
where people are going to call too as an
example.

2116
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:33,703
That's it.
I think this is also a symptom of the 

2117
01:37:35,301 --> 01:37:36,134
social media era today,
especially with twitter because you 

2118
01:37:38,631 --> 01:37:42,860
can't express yourself and explain 
things 140 or 280 characters.

2119
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:45,110
It just takes too much time so they can 
say,

2120
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:46,250
oh,
proud boys,

2121
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:51,140
racist scumbag nazi gavin,
and they'll always racist gum back nazi.

2122
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:53,870
Then all of a sudden that's the 
narrative and everybody keeps pushing it

2123
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:56,040
and the videos of people punching

2124
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,150
little skinny people.
Oh,

2125
01:37:57,151 --> 01:37:58,830
look at these people.
They beat up the antifa,

2126
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:01,980
these fucking assholes,
and gavin's an asshole.

2127
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:02,970
Yeah,
that's,

2128
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:06,120
that's what it comes down to.
I've seen it presented a.

2129
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:07,463
Well.
You ask how it starts and how it grows 

2130
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:12,090
and how you become a member by buying a 
fucking shirt,

2131
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,313
by buying a perry ellis shirt and 
opening a chapter to their chapters 

2132
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:18,990
worldwide.
You see it.

2133
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:20,250
It's like,
here's the,

2134
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,770
the proud boys Australia.
Here's the properties.

2135
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,710
England proud boys,
fucking Japan,

2136
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:26,663
like it's everywhere and it never was 
supposed to get to that point and 

2137
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:36,261
regardless of how these people act,
it now reflects on gavin.

2138
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:37,583
Even though he wanted to hang out in a 
bar with a few people do is public 

2139
01:38:41,461 --> 01:38:44,070
speaking without being hassled.
And that's it.

2140
01:38:44,350 --> 01:38:45,183
And,
and I see the way the media manipulates 

2141
01:38:46,981 --> 01:38:47,814
things.
I've been party to it myself and I've 

2142
01:38:50,401 --> 01:38:53,760
seen gavin presented in photos where you
look and go,

2143
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,960
holy fuck.

2144
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,940
It's hitler.
Liked like they get them.

2145
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:58,350
There's one picture,
gavin,

2146
01:38:58,351 --> 01:39:00,780
that I was petrified by.
He's got his arms folded,

2147
01:39:00,781 --> 01:39:03,360
he's got a scowl on his face,
that hair,

2148
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:04,580
you know,
the short on the side,

2149
01:39:04,581 --> 01:39:09,040
long on the top and he's looking like,
like he's angry and I'm like that,

2150
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:10,493
that stuff.
The guy that him and his wife who is 

2151
01:39:11,941 --> 01:39:14,130
american indian by the way,
his wife is american indian.

2152
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,113
He's got beautiful kids that come over 
my house and use the pool and we hang 

2153
01:39:18,361 --> 01:39:19,800
out and barbecue.
I'm like,

2154
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:24,090
that's not that guy.
No one knows that guy from the paper.

2155
01:39:24,091 --> 01:39:28,050
They're getting this impression.
He's a really nice guy.

2156
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,690
He's.
He's a generous.

2157
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:35,720
Just a really cool guy to hang out with 
and what you see them do in the media is

2158
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:36,804
just crazy.
Especially when you know he didn't 

2159
01:39:38,581 --> 01:39:41,430
invent some goddamn nazi group.

2160
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,990
He was just trying to have a little 
outrageous fun and it ran from him.

2161
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,390
It got away from the origin of it 
though.

2162
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:51,480
The way you're describing that is 
fucking fantastic.

2163
01:39:51,481 --> 01:39:52,314
Isn't that nuts?
It's crazy that that is what presented 

2164
01:39:55,601 --> 01:39:56,101
it.
I mean that,

2165
01:39:56,101 --> 01:39:59,330
that emerged out of that.
We,

2166
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,650
we,
we fuck with rat all the time.

2167
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:02,633
[inaudible] we go.
Can you believe the inspiration for the 

2168
01:40:05,371 --> 01:40:07,530
proud boys?
Is this little jewish?

2169
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:09,640
Where is that guy?
Photo of online.

2170
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:10,321
He.
Oh,

2171
01:40:10,321 --> 01:40:14,070
I'm sure there is rat compound media 
rat.

2172
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,670
You'll probably find them.
Uh,

2173
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:17,910
it's.
How much does this weird you out though?

2174
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:21,000
That compound media was the source of 
all this is weird.

2175
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,053
Like,
and it's one of those things you worry 

2176
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:24,093
about like,
like I don't want to then be taught 

2177
01:40:26,221 --> 01:40:28,470
because I know how it works.
I love gavin,

2178
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:31,710
but I don't want to be tied to the proud
boys at this point.

2179
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:32,783
You know,
I got my own fucking problems through 

2180
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:36,870
history.
I don't need any more piled on me.

2181
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:38,820
But what was that thing that I'd sent 
you?

2182
01:40:38,821 --> 01:40:40,040
That.
There he is.

2183
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:41,730
There he is.
That's a rat.

2184
01:40:41,731 --> 01:40:43,190
I guess that was halloween.
Okay.

2185
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,070
You,
what's this?

2186
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:47,610
I was wearing a suit that was,
I was the mayor from jaws.

2187
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,920
Mayor von.
I was for halloween.

2188
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:53,930
That's awesome.
That's the guy that the proud boys.

2189
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:59,380
The proud boys got 1938 propaganda 
posters.

2190
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:01,930
LIttle cutie isn't a norman rockwell 
painting.

2191
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:04,580
That's it.
He should be there with like a guy who's

2192
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,350
handing them an apple pie.
Yeah.

2193
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:07,660
Yeah.
And that's,

2194
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:10,540
that's the face of the new nazi 
movement.

2195
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:14,560
I think that there's a lot of mistakes 
were made,

2196
01:41:14,930 --> 01:41:18,700
but gavin's gavin's made some mistakes 
and like his,

2197
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,530
his whole thing of,
of,

2198
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:25,510
of blurring the lines between parody and
honesty.

2199
01:41:25,810 --> 01:41:27,760
It's.
He thinks it's fun.

2200
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:30,610
It's very punk rock.
Like he came up last time.

2201
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:32,350
He's on the podcast,
which is a few years back.

2202
01:41:32,351 --> 01:41:35,260
He came on dressed like Michael Douglas 
from falling down.

2203
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,240
He had a briefcase.
He brought the suit,

2204
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,150
like the short sleeve shirts like that 
all the time now.

2205
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:41,980
Like he goes around I,
I just,

2206
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:45,280
I just did a skype interview with him 
yesterday,

2207
01:41:45,281 --> 01:41:47,940
two days ago from the hotel room.
And he.

2208
01:41:47,941 --> 01:41:48,774
Yeah,
he's got the pocket protector and the 

2209
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:50,890
pens and the glasses.

2210
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,120
Yeah,
like falling down.

2211
01:41:52,121 --> 01:41:53,950
He thinks it's funny,
but people need to understand.

2212
01:41:53,951 --> 01:41:58,270
And this is true.
He is the godfather of the hipsters.

2213
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,490
Yeah.
He'll put in godfather of hipsters.

2214
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,040
can google him,
he comes up,

2215
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:05,050
all of that wardrobe the guys are 
wearing.

2216
01:42:05,051 --> 01:42:06,970
They will.
They look like they're wearing old tiMey

2217
01:42:06,971 --> 01:42:07,804
suits with the skinny ties.
Gavin mcinnes literally started that 

2218
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:12,634
fashion trend in williamsburg and they.
It took off from there that the hipster 

2219
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:17,823
dress,
the way people would dress with those 

2220
01:42:19,301 --> 01:42:23,110
weird mustaches and all that shit that 
literally came out of gavin gavin,

2221
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,960
which is amazing.
The motherfucker is.

2222
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:27,003
He is a guy.
There's something like magnetic about 

2223
01:42:31,661 --> 01:42:34,960
the guy.
He is what a cult leader is like.

2224
01:42:34,961 --> 01:42:35,794
He could Just start a cult,
which in essence by accident he did 

2225
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:43,760
between the hipsters and then this.
He's one of those guys like,

2226
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,310
I like gavin,
why don't you start?

2227
01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:48,280
Why don't you start a cult where you get
to fuck the people's wives.

2228
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:51,580
Like that kind of cult,
like why do you go with.

2229
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,433
We also did some really good interviews 
online where he would trIck these 

2230
01:42:57,011 --> 01:42:57,844
leftists into sitting down with him in 
interviews and then along the way there 

2231
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:06,160
we're having this conversation.
It would be exposed that he didn't agree

2232
01:43:06,161 --> 01:43:06,994
with them at all and they were trapped 
like this hardcore feminist got trapped 

2233
01:43:10,391 --> 01:43:11,224
with them.
A couple of other people get trapped in 

2234
01:43:12,821 --> 01:43:16,000
this room with him and they,
they realized like halfway,

2235
01:43:16,001 --> 01:43:18,650
like some of the line of questioning and
the way he's approaching things.

2236
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:19,990
So like,
oh my god,

2237
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:22,750
he's an interesting guy.
He's very interesting.

2238
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,460
And outside of this voice thing of you 
never,

2239
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,950
never invented that.
They never did any of that.

2240
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,750
He would be doing great.
Yeah.

2241
01:43:28,751 --> 01:43:29,584
Although he had a problem with one of 
one of his own companies that he made 

2242
01:43:32,561 --> 01:43:36,380
after vice,
they bought them out of vice because uh,

2243
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:41,470
shane turned more liberal and it wasn't 
really,

2244
01:43:41,471 --> 01:43:44,410
they weren't really a meshing anymore 
over their advice.

2245
01:43:44,411 --> 01:43:47,230
So they kind of just bought out a gavin.
He,

2246
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:49,420
he got a lot of money,
decided to do his own thing.

2247
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:50,290
He,
uh,

2248
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:51,980
had an firm,
I guess

2249
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,710
it was.
Yeah.

2250
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:53,543
Uh,
and then he got the boot from that for 

2251
01:43:55,701 --> 01:43:56,534
making a trans gender comments.
We'll use opinion on transgender people 

2252
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:02,560
have mental health,
mental health issue.

2253
01:44:02,561 --> 01:44:05,540
And he was brInging up all these.
Here's the problem.

2254
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:06,613
He was,
he was saying some things that are 

2255
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:09,610
correct.
Yeah.

2256
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:14,540
Interspersed with again,
yesterday and sarcasm in his mind.

2257
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,070
This was like,
just,

2258
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:19,700
this is something you can talk about 
where it was in the public side,

2259
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,580
particularly during the caitlyn jenner,
the whole thing.

2260
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:25,100
people had decided the transgender was 
amazing.

2261
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,540
It's amazing,
it's beautiful.

2262
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:28,100
She's incredible.
And he was saying,

2263
01:44:28,101 --> 01:44:28,934
no,
these are people that are menTally ill 

2264
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:30,673
and there's an a,
there's a website that he was pointing 

2265
01:44:32,571 --> 01:44:33,404
to,
I think it's called transgender regrets 

2266
01:44:34,761 --> 01:44:35,594
or something like that where they haVe 
all these stories of all these men who 

2267
01:44:38,751 --> 01:44:40,400
turned Into women and then turned back 
to men again.

2268
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,810
Now they don't have dicks.
No,

2269
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,900
they have to take testosterone 
injections and they hate their life.

2270
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:45,943
And there's some of them who did it like
when they were in their sixties and now 

2271
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:50,520
now they're in their seventies and 
trying to be a man again.

2272
01:44:50,521 --> 01:44:54,230
And,
and that gender dysphoria was thought to

2273
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:57,680
be a mental health issue.
Like anorexia,

2274
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:59,420
like a lot,
a lot of other.

2275
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:02,900
There's body dysphoria,
but people have weird,

2276
01:45:02,901 --> 01:45:04,160
um,
you know,

2277
01:45:04,161 --> 01:45:05,440
a bodybuilders credit,
they,

2278
01:45:05,441 --> 01:45:07,130
they,
they never think they're big enough.

2279
01:45:07,890 --> 01:45:12,890
You have like weird perceptions of their
physical presence in there and some,

2280
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:15,200
uh,
I had a psychologist,

2281
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:16,034
dr deborah,
so who was discussing late onset gender 

2282
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:22,160
dysphoria in autistic girls that 
autistic teenage girls,

2283
01:45:22,161 --> 01:45:22,994
they don't feel like they fit in and 
people can convince them that they're 

2284
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:25,850
actually a man.
Wow.

2285
01:45:25,851 --> 01:45:28,150
And so a lot of them start taking 
hormones and,

2286
01:45:28,151 --> 01:45:29,750
and,
and going through transition,

2287
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:34,040
massive regrets.
And then unfortunately for women,

2288
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:35,023
when,
especially when you're a teenager and 

2289
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:39,020
you're going through puberty and you 
take hormones,

2290
01:45:39,110 --> 01:45:41,540
you literally start developing male 
features.

2291
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:43,950
YoUr face gets harder and thicker and 
wider.

2292
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,070
Your shoulders get bigger,
like the whole deal.

2293
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:47,160
Your hands.
Yeah.

2294
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:49,290
Click gross.
the size of a thumb you.

2295
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:53,710
So you make these irreversible changes 
or unless you know.

2296
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:57,230
So you just described jim norton's dream
girl.

2297
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:58,093
Yeah.

2298
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,490
This is a perfect.
Jim norton is.

2299
01:46:01,491 --> 01:46:02,324
I love him to death.
He's a perfect example to have someone 

2300
01:46:04,461 --> 01:46:06,530
who's bulletproof because that's what he
is.

2301
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:08,730
He's a,
he's charming at like,

2302
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:12,410
like in his,
his fucking debauchery.

2303
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:13,070
Uh,
he's,

2304
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:13,903
he's a charming guy.
Girls love him and think he's adorable 

2305
01:46:16,990 --> 01:46:17,823
at when he's saying some of the most 
heinous shit onstage and on the air and 

2306
01:46:21,591 --> 01:46:22,610
stuff.
You know,

2307
01:46:22,611 --> 01:46:23,690
where he's coming from.
Yeah,

2308
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,380
yeah,
yeah.

2309
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:26,540
Well,
there's no mistaking it like he,

2310
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:29,340
he wears everything honestly.
So,

2311
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:30,174
uh,
he wrote the forward and in my book 

2312
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:33,110
permanently suspended.
He wrote,

2313
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:34,760
he wrote the foreword.
He knows me,

2314
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:39,110
like it's my brother first and then jim 
norton.

2315
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:41,630
Yeah,
like jim knows me really well.

2316
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,150
We're,
we're really good friends and I love the

2317
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:46,520
guy.
Why didn't you guys wind up doing a show

2318
01:46:46,521 --> 01:46:48,200
together when opie and anthony crashed?

2319
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,150
I,
I think,

2320
01:46:51,151 --> 01:46:51,984
look,
I can't blame anybody because I think 

2321
01:46:54,871 --> 01:46:59,871
that having the security of a steady 
paycheck as opposed to the guy that just

2322
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:02,950
got thrown off of everything,
opening,

2323
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:05,030
starting his own thing,
uh,

2324
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:09,960
it probably wasn't all that appealing to
jimmy who had just bought a new place in

2325
01:47:09,961 --> 01:47:11,940
the city and everything.
Is it just a,

2326
01:47:11,941 --> 01:47:13,650
it wasn't the right time.
And then,

2327
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:15,330
you know,
as time went on,

2328
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:19,080
he became the go to guy over at sirius,
um,

2329
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,150
from the opiod anthony show.
So,

2330
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:22,680
uh,
I would love to,

2331
01:47:22,681 --> 01:47:25,280
and I do is chip,
chip recent show and you know,

2332
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:26,123
we're doing,
we're doing one in philly next week at 

2333
01:47:28,771 --> 01:47:29,850
the live show.
Yeah.

2334
01:47:29,851 --> 01:47:31,800
We've been doing these live shows on 
long island.

2335
01:47:31,801 --> 01:47:35,390
We did one up in boston and it's 
hilarious jokes.

2336
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:40,420
He comes out and the crowd goes fucking 
wild and he's got to be in character the

2337
01:47:41,671 --> 01:47:42,504
whole time.

2338
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:45,630
It's got to kill them.
It's got a killer.

2339
01:47:46,150 --> 01:47:46,983
And it's so much fun to do.
I love playing the straight guy cohost 

2340
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:54,150
to his fucking insane character.
But uh,

2341
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:55,860
yeah,
we've done these live shows and they're,

2342
01:47:55,861 --> 01:47:57,720
they're really a lot of fun.
Um,

2343
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:02,810
and he's just a fucking.
Oh my god,

2344
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:09,510
it's so ridiculous.
He's gotta stay and look at those pants.

2345
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:14,880
Yeah.
Places like packed and it's crazy.

2346
01:48:14,881 --> 01:48:16,500
You guys reading,
what are the notes?

2347
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,120
Oh,
he,

2348
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,750
he wanted us to.
He wrote,

2349
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,460
he wrote like a,
uh,

2350
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:21,323
almost a play,
but it's all just kissing chips ass and 

2351
01:48:24,091 --> 01:48:27,100
how wonderful chip is.
And how thankful we are to be there.

2352
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:31,290
Like it's so goddamn funny.
I love it.

2353
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:33,330
He's a,
he's a brilliant man.

2354
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:36,090
He's just A great guy.
And very fuckIng funny.

2355
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:41,280
I knew from the first.
I think that also kind of.

2356
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:45,930
I'm not blaming jimmy or anything,
but I think that helped to kind of break

2357
01:48:45,931 --> 01:48:47,940
up the o and a show in time.

2358
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:52,200
I think opie started resenting the 
little bit of that comradery that me and

2359
01:48:52,201 --> 01:48:54,030
jimmy were having.
Um,

2360
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:54,893
me and jimmy kind of slowly started 
pulling away and doing our own thing 

2361
01:48:58,170 --> 01:49:01,860
like it was.
And the humor is,

2362
01:49:01,890 --> 01:49:02,370
you know,
the,

2363
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:05,850
the more twisted the better.
I love sick humor.

2364
01:49:05,851 --> 01:49:07,410
He does too.
and we laugh.

2365
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:11,980
We did a whole bit on,
on like lacy peterson and Scott Peterson

2366
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:13,260
that the murder.
Yeah.

2367
01:49:13,261 --> 01:49:14,094
And you would think like,
obviously he murdered his pregnant wife 

2368
01:49:16,171 --> 01:49:19,440
and dumped in the ocean.
What could possibly be funny about that?

2369
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,800
Well,
people wrote trIbute songs with this guy

2370
01:49:22,801 --> 01:49:23,634
wrote a tribute song to her and it 
another one of these self centered 

2371
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:29,580
assholes that thought he was going to go
viral by making a attributes.

2372
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:31,103
And we started changing the words to the
song to make it just horrible involving 

2373
01:49:35,701 --> 01:49:38,010
seaweed and things,
so it was terrible.

2374
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:40,470
But me and jim are literally crying,
laughing,

2375
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:42,540
and oh,
at least just kind of sitting there,

2376
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:43,553
like not really able to jump in or not 
kind of getting why we're laughing at 

2377
01:49:47,981 --> 01:49:49,550
this sick shit.
Uh,

2378
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:53,010
so it kind of pushed us further apart.
Um,

2379
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,460
at that point.
Yeah.

2380
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:55,883
We,
we both as people changed over the 

2381
01:49:57,341 --> 01:49:58,174
course of the 20 years we worked 
together 20 fucking years with anybody 

2382
01:50:02,741 --> 01:50:04,450
do.
If this is nuts,

2383
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:05,553
you got a girl that's suck your dick 
every day for 20 years you're going to 

2384
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,210
be like,
oh fuck,

2385
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,670
stop sucking my dick.
But now it's,

2386
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:13,630
think it's open across from me,
you know?

2387
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:14,493
Yeah.
Uh,

2388
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:16,120
so you're going to get on each other's 
nerves.

2389
01:50:16,121 --> 01:50:17,920
And I'm not innocent in the whole thing 
either.

2390
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:19,030
Uh,
but I was,

2391
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:22,390
I'm a lot more laid back.
Like I,

2392
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:27,430
I knew what real work was.
I worked for fucking living.

2393
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:31,480
I did heating and air conditioning 
installation and it was freezing cold in

2394
01:50:31,481 --> 01:50:33,040
the winter and boiling hot in the 
summer.

2395
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:33,874
And when I got that first gig and radio 
because of opie and I'll always thank 

2396
01:50:37,661 --> 01:50:38,540
him for that.
Uh,

2397
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:42,190
I knew what it was like to work and I 
didn't want to fuck that up.

2398
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:47,520
So I plasTered a smile on my face at 
every turn and did the show four hours a

2399
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:48,724
day.
Everyone has someone at work that they 

2400
01:50:51,041 --> 01:50:54,490
don't get along with.
You don't leave the old fucking,

2401
01:50:54,491 --> 01:50:56,020
you know,
you just deal with it.

2402
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:56,993
And that's eight hours.
I had another 20 hours of the day that 

2403
01:50:59,141 --> 01:51:02,860
didn't involve greg opi hughes so I 
could deal with it.

2404
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,620
Uh,
he was more like,

2405
01:51:05,621 --> 01:51:09,880
he had a express himself a little more,
which I guess is healthy in a way.

2406
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:12,670
But uh,
I didn't need to,

2407
01:51:12,671 --> 01:51:14,380
so I didn't,
I didn't text him.

2408
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:16,440
I didn't call him.
I uh,

2409
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,333
he,
we got into an argument once and he 

2410
01:51:18,161 --> 01:51:19,060
goes,
dude,

2411
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:22,090
you never even been to my house.
And I go,

2412
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:24,700
alright,
get everyone from the show in here.

2413
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,120
Jim,
have I ever been to the house?

2414
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:27,220
Nope.
Travis?

2415
01:51:27,221 --> 01:51:28,120
No.
Sam,

2416
01:51:28,121 --> 01:51:29,260
no.
Iraq.

2417
01:51:29,261 --> 01:51:31,480
No.
I've never been to anyone's house.

2418
01:51:31,481 --> 01:51:33,080
Let me tell you something right now.
Yeah,

2419
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:37,450
that's something much chick would say.
I know that when my house toad,

2420
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:39,340
it's exactly that.
Been in my house.

2421
01:51:39,930 --> 01:51:41,460
What does that mean?
What does that even mean?

2422
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:44,660
I never been africa.
What the fuck are you saying?

2423
01:51:44,661 --> 01:51:45,494
I've never been to Spain.
What does that have to do with anything 

2424
01:51:46,701 --> 01:51:47,534
that if,
if you had a problem with me not coming 

2425
01:51:49,511 --> 01:51:50,344
to your house,
why didn't you ask me to come to your 

2426
01:51:51,431 --> 01:51:52,264
house?
Yeah.

2427
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:54,960
Like is there like a you asking me 
everyday and I'm saying no.

2428
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:56,140
Was saying no.
Right,

2429
01:51:56,141 --> 01:51:57,130
right.
What's going on?

2430
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:59,830
It was always something like that.
And believe me,

2431
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:01,520
I'm not gonna sit here and shit on the 
guy.

2432
01:52:01,521 --> 01:52:03,730
I that my shows for that,
uh,

2433
01:52:03,731 --> 01:52:07,270
I'm not gonna fucking around.
I'm not going to sit on the guy.

2434
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,930
But there were definitely personality 
quirks and that I guess we both had.

2435
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:13,890
But there was something like if,
if I,

2436
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,300
I would party all the time and,
and you know,

2437
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,153
I had to be there at 6:00
AM and I'm driving from roslyn long 

2438
01:52:20,981 --> 01:52:22,630
island to New York city.
It's,

2439
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:23,523
it's 25,
30 miles of just fucked traffic every 

2440
01:52:26,431 --> 01:52:28,720
day.
He had to take you to get there.

2441
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:30,183
It could be 35 minutes,
it could be an hour and a half based on 

2442
01:52:35,021 --> 01:52:36,850
if someone's pulled over on the side of 
the road,

2443
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:39,850
some asshole crashes in queens,
whatever it was.

2444
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:40,810
It was,
uh,

2445
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,750
it was a shit drive every day and you 
had to be there at six,

2446
01:52:43,751 --> 01:52:43,950
right?

2447
01:52:43,950 --> 01:52:44,783
Six o'clock the show started.
And so even at six they'd be that kind 

2448
01:52:47,181 --> 01:52:48,440
of traffic.
Yeah.

2449
01:52:48,441 --> 01:52:51,500
Yeah.
It wasn't as bad as it got,

2450
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:54,230
like seven or eight,
but you never really knew.

2451
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:55,640
It could,
it could.

2452
01:52:55,641 --> 01:52:56,474
I was never late late,
but there were times I'd come in at 

2453
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:00,140
five,
after eight,

2454
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:02,990
after six was pretty much as late as I 
would,

2455
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:04,820
I would be.
It was never more than that.

2456
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:06,343
But he would go like,
he never had to say anything like the 

2457
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:09,703
music starts.
There's a little a bumper at the 

2458
01:53:11,871 --> 01:53:14,260
beginning and by the time it starts,
I,

2459
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:17,360
I'd sit down and he on mike would go,
um,

2460
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:18,673
well,
I guess there was traffic anthony just 

2461
01:53:19,761 --> 01:53:23,570
getting in and other bosses are 
listening and it was,

2462
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:26,660
it just wasn't necessary to do that,
you know,

2463
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:27,381
it,
it kind of.

2464
01:53:27,381 --> 01:53:28,680
I was like,
you wanted something,

2465
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:33,350
you got to be guys don't do that,
guys don't do that to each other.

2466
01:53:33,650 --> 01:53:35,450
You fucking sit down.
Don't say a word.

2467
01:53:35,451 --> 01:53:37,310
No one would know I'm late,
you know.

2468
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:40,120
And that's what happened.
And it,

2469
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:42,560
there were instances like that all the 
time.

2470
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:44,780
It's all in my book,
permanently suspended.

2471
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:46,550
Uh,
there's that book out now.

2472
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:50,620
It's out now.
A border's barnes and noble and we think

2473
01:53:50,621 --> 01:53:52,160
we have a copy of the green.
Oh yes.

2474
01:53:52,161 --> 01:53:53,620
Very good.
Uh,

2475
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:54,830
but,
but I taught something.

2476
01:53:54,831 --> 01:53:55,970
Somebody's house.
It's in my house.

2477
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:59,410
I talk a lot about obviously the 
relationship and,

2478
01:53:59,411 --> 01:54:01,160
and uh,
with opie and,

2479
01:54:01,170 --> 01:54:03,450
and how it kind of slowly,
uh,

2480
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:07,130
came apart at the seams,
I think toward the end.

2481
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,830
Uh,
he just had had it.

2482
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:12,410
He didn't want to do a show with me 
anymore.

2483
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:14,930
I don't think you want to do a show with
jimmy either.

2484
01:54:15,530 --> 01:54:18,810
That didn't last long and I knew it 
wasn't going to last long and they,

2485
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,410
I was the buffer between the two of 
them.

2486
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,330
That ended bad.
It really did.

2487
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:26,090
It really did.
Uh,

2488
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:29,540
have you talked to jimmy about it?
Like he doesn't,

2489
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:32,270
he doesn't express that kind of.
No,

2490
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:33,583
no.
He doesn't like jimmy's a very loyalty 

2491
01:54:35,781 --> 01:54:37,290
driven guy.
Uh,

2492
01:54:37,710 --> 01:54:42,470
like he takes that very seriously and if
he feels somebody fucking with him,

2493
01:54:42,471 --> 01:54:44,380
he really gets pissed.
Uh,

2494
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:47,810
usually it can get talked out and 
everything's cool after a little while.

2495
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:49,430
Uh,
but this one,

2496
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:50,690
uh,
this,

2497
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:53,670
this work.
Yeah.

2498
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:54,633
No,
no.

2499
01:54:54,710 --> 01:54:55,543
I think honestly,
the way you guys interacted with each 

2500
01:54:58,071 --> 01:54:58,904
other,
what he was good for was sort of 

2501
01:54:59,841 --> 01:55:00,674
directing the whole thing.
That's the impression that I got and I 

2502
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:04,730
mean,
how many times I do the show?

2503
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:05,773
Dozens,
right?

2504
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:06,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

2505
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:07,820
I mean how many times it did it.
Absolutely.

2506
01:55:07,821 --> 01:55:08,654
But I always felt like what he did 
really well was sort of guide things 

2507
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:13,730
like,
sit back more.

2508
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:15,940
Let you guys be funny,
but,

2509
01:55:16,270 --> 01:55:17,630
but guide,
like,

2510
01:55:17,631 --> 01:55:19,790
figure out like maybe we need more of 
this,

2511
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:22,850
maybe we need more of that.
There was real value to that.

2512
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:23,773
Absolutely.
But do you think that's fun when you go 

2513
01:55:25,611 --> 01:55:26,444
out and do an appearance and everyone's 
clamoring about a bit that me and jimmy 

2514
01:55:30,981 --> 01:55:33,230
did or something for him.
Yeah.

2515
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:35,360
And he's sitting there going like,
well,

2516
01:55:35,361 --> 01:55:36,194
I,
I pushed a button and I drove the ship 

2517
01:55:38,571 --> 01:55:43,220
and I went to spots and if he knew it's,
it's,

2518
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:44,880
it's funny because like,
yeah,

2519
01:55:44,881 --> 01:55:47,160
you're not going to be appreciated as 
much,

2520
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:49,600
but it's like a guy who,
uh,

2521
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:52,260
is good at defense,
but he doesn't score a lot of points.

2522
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:53,220
Yeah,
yeah,

2523
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:56,040
yeah.
You're not going to be lebron james.

2524
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:58,630
It's necessary guys who score the points
though,

2525
01:55:58,631 --> 01:56:00,640
or the ones who everybody wants to talk 
to you,

2526
01:56:00,641 --> 01:56:00,850
you know?

2527
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:01,950
Yeah.
You ever see?

2528
01:56:02,290 --> 01:56:03,290
Uh,
I,

2529
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:04,740
I Think of opiod,
like,

2530
01:56:04,741 --> 01:56:06,570
um,
you ever see the prestige,

2531
01:56:06,571 --> 01:56:08,820
the movie the prestige,
uh,

2532
01:56:08,821 --> 01:56:12,800
with the,
the two magicians know and it,

2533
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:13,360
it,
it's,

2534
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:14,760
it's a good movie.
It's a good movie,

2535
01:56:14,761 --> 01:56:15,930
but at one point,
uh,

2536
01:56:15,950 --> 01:56:18,780
because he has to use a body double,
uh,

2537
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:19,614
the actual magician has to drop below 
the stage and the body double comes out 

2538
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:26,700
and gets all the applause and he's under
the stage.

2539
01:56:26,701 --> 01:56:27,534
The real guy that did the whole act is 
under the stage and he shuts his eyes 

2540
01:56:31,321 --> 01:56:32,154
and puts his arms out,
like trying to enjoy the adulation from 

2541
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:37,770
the fans,
but it's not even him getting it.

2542
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:41,340
And I think that kind of mindset was 
there.

2543
01:56:41,341 --> 01:56:42,174
There's.
And then resentment starts bubbling up 

2544
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:50,240
and you start doing things like saying,
anthony just got in,

2545
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:53,180
um,
you,

2546
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:55,140
you hold things over people's heads.

2547
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:59,220
the contract negotiations were a 
nightmare every time.

2548
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:02,190
And opiate always wanted a one year 
deal.

2549
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:03,660
I'm like,
what the fuck are you doing?

2550
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:06,090
Let's sign for 10 years.
Who gives a shit?

2551
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:07,890
You know,
if they want to fire they're gonna fight

2552
01:57:07,891 --> 01:57:09,660
it anyway,
the contract or not,

2553
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:13,380
but let's lock them in.
So if something happens,

2554
01:57:13,381 --> 01:57:14,480
at least we have a,
uh,

2555
01:57:14,590 --> 01:57:17,640
a settlement portion,
we can take half the,

2556
01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:19,800
what they owe us for five years,
whatever it is.

2557
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:20,843
Not one year deal,
that's all I want because he always had 

2558
01:57:22,651 --> 01:57:23,484
this delusion of grandeur,
like there was always something better 

2559
01:57:26,970 --> 01:57:27,803
waiting for us to grab up and it's like 
the truth of the matter was the glory 

2560
01:57:32,341 --> 01:57:35,370
years of the o and a show were gone.
The new year's and the,

2561
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:38,070
you know,
all that crazy fucking radio.

2562
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:42,960
We were damaged goods after the sex in 
st patrick's cathedral debacle.

2563
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:45,050
We had a couple,
um,

2564
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:49,100
we had a contest where people had to go 
around New York city and have sex at,

2565
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:53,020
at various famous locations with the 
hard rock cafe and um,

2566
01:57:53,130 --> 01:57:54,540
empire state building,
things like that.

2567
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:57,600
And we had spotters who were comics or 
people that work for the show,

2568
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:00,240
follow them around and they would call 
us on the show and go,

2569
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:01,173
all right,
we're here at the empire state building 

2570
01:58:01,951 --> 01:58:03,810
and he's doing it.
I'm watching them right now.

2571
01:58:03,811 --> 01:58:07,560
So we had paul mecurio who was a comic 
and he,

2572
01:58:07,561 --> 01:58:08,394
uh,
was following one couple of round and a 

2573
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,970
opiate put church on the list.
Um,

2574
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:15,030
and I went like,
ooh,

2575
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:16,380
I dunno man.
He goes,

2576
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:20,100
it's just to read on the air and say 
like what locations are,

2577
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:21,610
and when we say church,
people go like,

2578
01:58:21,630 --> 01:58:22,650
oh,
dr ranges,

2579
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:23,850
but no one's going to go to church.

2580
01:58:23,850 --> 01:58:25,470
Don't worry.
Well,

2581
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,600
paul calls up and goes,
well,

2582
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:32,601
we're here at st pat's and he's doing 
the two point conversion.

2583
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:34,223
you've got an extra two points if you 
were fucking her in the ass at the 

2584
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:39,690
location because they all had point 
values for how dangerous it was.

2585
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:42,870
A pat was watching to be sure that it 
went in the house.

2586
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:44,350
Paul paul was watching.
Yeah.

2587
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:46,980
Yeah.
the spotter was supposed to watch and to

2588
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:48,820
watch this guy.
Fuck has grown the ass.

2589
01:58:48,821 --> 01:58:49,541
Yeah.
Yeah.

2590
01:58:49,541 --> 01:58:53,590
There was a lot of theater of the mind 
going on to who knows what the fuck they

2591
01:58:53,591 --> 01:58:54,424
were doing or where I heard.
I hear it was in the vestibule outside 

2592
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:58,473
st pat's,
but regardless it's sex at st pat's and 

2593
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:03,550
a nope.
We looked at each other.

2594
01:59:03,551 --> 01:59:06,340
We both had digital delay,
like the delay button.

2595
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:09,010
A seven second.
We have like a 32nd delay.

2596
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:10,083
We both had buttons in front of us.
There was another guy in a locked room 

2597
01:59:12,431 --> 01:59:13,264
down the hall that had a button to dump 
out of because we were constantly doing 

2598
01:59:15,911 --> 01:59:17,710
shit that would have gotten fcc 
complaints.

2599
01:59:17,711 --> 01:59:18,544
So the boston stalled these buttons 
everywhere while we both had our finger 

2600
01:59:21,971 --> 01:59:22,804
on it.
Con like,

2601
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:26,140
shit,
do we punch out of this?

2602
01:59:26,141 --> 01:59:26,974
It's hilarious guys.
Fucking his girl in the ass at st pat's 

2603
01:59:30,030 --> 01:59:33,220
a and neither of us hit the button and 
the guY down the hall didn't hit it.

2604
01:59:33,221 --> 01:59:36,240
We just went with it at that moment.
It's like,

2605
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:40,900
that is one of those moments like talk 
about a defining moment.

2606
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:45,460
You move your finger one inch down and 
that never happens.

2607
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:48,940
It's amazing to think about.
What year was this?

2608
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:51,910
A 2002,
I believe.

2609
01:59:51,911 --> 01:59:52,900
2,000.
It was,

2610
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:53,920
yeah,
we,

2611
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:56,110
it was nine slash 11.
Uh,

2612
01:59:56,111 --> 01:59:58,120
we,
we went through nine slash 11 on the air

2613
01:59:58,121 --> 01:59:58,480
and stuff.

2614
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:03,480
And then I guess that summer maybe.
What year did you guys wind up on xm?

2615
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:06,490
A 2004,
I think it was.

2616
02:00:06,491 --> 02:00:10,030
We had to sit out two fucking years out 
of our contract.

2617
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:11,590
Uh,
not working.

2618
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:16,030
They didn't want us to go to mornings 
because a clear channel radio,

2619
02:00:16,031 --> 02:00:19,330
which was another radio company and cbs 
were,

2620
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:23,380
we're kind of fighting for us,
a clear channel wanted us to do mornings

2621
02:00:23,381 --> 02:00:26,270
against howard stern who was on cbs.
Uh,

2622
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:28,630
we worked for cbs at the time doing 
afternoons,

2623
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:29,883
so we,
we were put in a position where they 

2624
02:00:31,091 --> 02:00:33,910
were both just throwing huge amounts of 
money at us.

2625
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:35,590
Uh,
and cbs was like,

2626
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,380
we can't let them go to morning,
so we,

2627
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:40,233
it would be impossible to beat howard,
but we would take enough listeners away 

2628
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,370
where he might not be number one 
anymore.

2629
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:47,050
That affects revenue,
you know,

2630
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:48,213
you want to,
you want to sell the show as the number 

2631
02:00:49,331 --> 02:00:50,200
one rated show.

2632
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:51,453
Uh,
so cbs was doing anything they could to 

2633
02:00:53,261 --> 02:00:55,870
keep us in afternoons with the same 
company as howard.

2634
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:58,720
Uh,
so it was the most lucrative contract we

2635
02:00:58,721 --> 02:01:00,490
ever signed.
It was a three year deal.

2636
02:01:01,450 --> 02:01:05,590
We signed it in I guess 2001.
And uh,

2637
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:06,843
after one year they canceled the show 
because of the sex at st pat's thing 

2638
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:12,220
that blew up.
I mean,

2639
02:01:12,221 --> 02:01:13,600
it was in the newspapers,
it was,

2640
02:01:13,601 --> 02:01:16,430
I had to look at opi and dopey on the 
front page of.

2641
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:17,501
I'm like,
fuck,

2642
02:01:17,501 --> 02:01:20,560
I'm dopey,
dopey.

2643
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:23,410
I was so embarrassing.
My family and everything.

2644
02:01:23,411 --> 02:01:25,990
It was just fucking nuts.
So,

2645
02:01:25,991 --> 02:01:28,360
uh,
the cbs was like,

2646
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:29,590
well,
we canceled your show,

2647
02:01:29,591 --> 02:01:31,270
but we're not letting you out of your 
contract.

2648
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:32,590
Like,
what does that mean?

2649
02:01:32,591 --> 02:01:34,150
We talked to our agent and he goes,
well,

2650
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:36,250
you can't work.
They'Re not letting you work.

2651
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:38,290
You'll still get paid and do it.

2652
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:39,123
I'm talking of dollars.
This was millions of dollars that they 

2653
02:01:42,201 --> 02:01:45,950
had to give us for two years.
But you think like,

2654
02:01:45,951 --> 02:01:46,784
oh,
that's awesome.

2655
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:50,120
And back then there was no internet to 
speak of.

2656
02:01:50,121 --> 02:01:50,954
Like,
like you had no way to contact your 

2657
02:01:51,831 --> 02:01:52,670
fans.
Well,

2658
02:01:52,671 --> 02:01:53,504
you could have a website,
which is what are the ways that we 

2659
02:01:55,671 --> 02:01:57,620
became friends as I wrote about you 
guys,

2660
02:01:57,650 --> 02:01:58,730
right?
Yeah,

2661
02:01:58,731 --> 02:01:59,564
yeah.
I wrote a big piece on my website about 

2662
02:02:01,341 --> 02:02:02,800
how it was.
Yeah,

2663
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:05,300
yeah.
A lot of people supported us,

2664
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:09,470
but it got a.
In two years you'd just disappear on the

2665
02:02:09,471 --> 02:02:10,304
radio.
It's if you're not doing a show and 

2666
02:02:12,341 --> 02:02:13,550
you're out there,
you will go away,

2667
02:02:13,551 --> 02:02:16,850
they will find something else.
So we were really worried about that.

2668
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:18,200
And again,
damaged goods.

2669
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:21,860
So no one was really clamoring to hire 
us anyway,

2670
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:23,623
but we went through two years where I 
was just making huge amounts of money 

2671
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:30,770
and just find toys.

2672
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:34,730
I would go.
I went to atlantis for a couple of weeks

2673
02:02:34,730 --> 02:02:35,563
ago in The Bahamas and I was literallY,
I was pulling my luggage to leave at 

2674
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:40,700
the,
uh,

2675
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:43,370
the desk and I go to my chick,
I go,

2676
02:02:44,150 --> 02:02:45,800
what do we,
where are we going home?

2677
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:47,211
He goes,
okay.

2678
02:02:47,211 --> 02:02:48,044
I said,
can I have the room for another two 

2679
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:49,761
weeks?
Like,

2680
02:02:49,761 --> 02:02:52,370
okay,
went back upstairs and just stayed for a

2681
02:02:52,370 --> 02:02:53,203
month.
I have no reason why am I going home 

2682
02:02:55,341 --> 02:02:56,174
after two weeks,
you're so conditioned like how long a 

2683
02:02:58,221 --> 02:03:01,850
vacation is and,
and that lasted for two years.

2684
02:03:01,851 --> 02:03:06,800
And then a satellite came calling,
which was we considered radio prison.

2685
02:03:07,190 --> 02:03:09,100
At that point it was radio jail.
Anybody that,

2686
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:13,130
because everyone that had fucked up and 
regular radio ended up in satellite,

2687
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:15,710
like no one wanted to be in satellite 
radio at the time.

2688
02:03:15,950 --> 02:03:19,550
They had no subscribers.
Me and opie sat on the side of,

2689
02:03:19,551 --> 02:03:20,361
uh,
the,

2690
02:03:20,361 --> 02:03:22,970
the belt parkway once by my house in 
brooklyn.

2691
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:24,433
And we were like,
let's see how many satellite radio 

2692
02:03:26,331 --> 02:03:29,090
antennas we see because they used to be 
very obvious shark fin,

2693
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:31,100
big antennas,
aftermarket.

2694
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:33,230
They stuck them and drilled them into 
your roof.

2695
02:03:33,231 --> 02:03:35,990
It was terrible.
The installation process was stupid.

2696
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:39,380
No one wanted to get fucked their car up
with this dumb antenna.

2697
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:42,470
So we're looking at when like nothing.
And then,

2698
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:44,030
oh look,
there's one.

2699
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:48,020
And you know,
the money's one thing obviously,

2700
02:03:48,021 --> 02:03:52,730
but as a broadcaster you want to fucking
be talking to people you know,

2701
02:03:52,731 --> 02:03:54,860
you want,
you want to entertain people,

2702
02:03:54,861 --> 02:03:55,820
you want people to say,
wow,

2703
02:03:55,821 --> 02:03:56,654
that was good.
And there was just no subscribers back 

2704
02:03:58,791 --> 02:04:02,810
then during our 10 years there.
It wound up getting very,

2705
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:03,740
very good.
And,

2706
02:04:03,741 --> 02:04:04,460
and,
uh,

2707
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:06,980
we had a lot of listeners,
but early on,

2708
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:09,680
no one but satellite was calling.
And,

2709
02:04:09,681 --> 02:04:10,300
uh,
we,

2710
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:12,080
we signed,
we signed the deal,

2711
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,030
um,
but we,

2712
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,820
we definitely would have preferred 
terrestrial radio.

2713
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:19,610
Yeah.
It's interesting now,

2714
02:04:19,611 --> 02:04:23,060
right?
Because now satellIte satellite became a

2715
02:04:23,061 --> 02:04:23,894
big thing when howard got on it 
[inaudible] and people were talking 

2716
02:04:26,601 --> 02:04:27,434
about it and then it became a big thing 
because every new car you buy you'd get 

2717
02:04:30,111 --> 02:04:34,730
a free 90 days or whatever.
But now no one gives a shit.

2718
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,070
Yeah,
it's,

2719
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:39,060
it's one of the short lived 
technology's,

2720
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:40,133
not that it's gone.
I think it'll always be there in some 

2721
02:04:41,581 --> 02:04:42,720
capacity.
Man.

2722
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:46,830
It is fucking clinging by a thread.
So many other,

2723
02:04:46,870 --> 02:04:48,690
um,
that's why they bought pandora.

2724
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:53,070
I guess there's so many other streaming 
outlets out there.

2725
02:04:53,190 --> 02:04:56,370
And the fact in podcasts,
the fact that podcasts are all free.

2726
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:57,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

2727
02:04:57,270 --> 02:05:00,140
And then you can play them in a tunnel,
right?

2728
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:03,950
It doesn't peter out on ya.
And uh,

2729
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:07,470
you know,
you get that signal constantly now.

2730
02:05:07,471 --> 02:05:09,990
So it's,
it's not like the old days a,

2731
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:10,853
every time you get in the car,
like your system identifies your phone 

2732
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:16,530
and then links up with commercials.

2733
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:17,990
I remember when theY started playing 
commercials,

2734
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,620
like,
what the fuck is this?

2735
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:22,780
I'm paying so that you can play 
commercials.

2736
02:05:22,781 --> 02:05:24,630
He ouT of your fucking mind.
Yeah.

2737
02:05:24,631 --> 02:05:28,260
That was a.
It was supposed to be a commercial free.

2738
02:05:28,261 --> 02:05:29,910
They all talk about commercial free and 
then it ends up.

2739
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:32,340
Oh,
if you listen into seven days on seven,

2740
02:05:32,341 --> 02:05:34,560
I guess you want to have to listen to a 
commercial.

2741
02:05:34,561 --> 02:05:36,650
But I think they have commercial.
Yeah.

2742
02:05:36,690 --> 02:05:38,460
They started throwing commercials on 
everything.

2743
02:05:38,461 --> 02:05:40,250
So yeah.
Yeah.

2744
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:41,290
Short lived,
uh,

2745
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:42,600
technology.
It's weird.

2746
02:05:42,601 --> 02:05:43,434
And then to put all of your eggs in a 
couple of baskets that are circling the 

2747
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:53,010
earth always seemed weird to me that you
can't get it in Hawaii.

2748
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:56,010
I think I told you guys when I went,
I went to hawaiian vacation.

2749
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:00,180
I got a car that had sirius xm built 
into it.

2750
02:06:00,181 --> 02:06:01,050
It didn't work.

2751
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:01,943
Yeah.
Yeah.

2752
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:02,933
What the fuck is this?
You have to deal with a satellite 

2753
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:06,720
orbiting the,
you know,

2754
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:09,870
something happens to the transmitter on 
a terrestrial station.

2755
02:06:09,871 --> 02:06:12,630
They send an engineer up there.
He turns a few screws or what have you.

2756
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,790
You know,
something fucks up in a satellite.

2757
02:06:14,791 --> 02:06:17,210
What are you going to do?
You know,

2758
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:22,340
howard gonna get an a rocket and fix the
fucking dumb technology at this point.

2759
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:23,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

2760
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:24,510
totally.
Unnecessary,

2761
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:29,600
unnecessary effect that sirius is still 
transmitted from a thing in the sky down

2762
02:06:29,821 --> 02:06:30,860
to the ground.
Yeah.

2763
02:06:30,910 --> 02:06:31,743
Yeah.
And then it's transmitted from the 

2764
02:06:32,911 --> 02:06:33,744
people on the ground up into the sky and
then back down to the people on the 

2765
02:06:37,321 --> 02:06:38,130
ground.
Yeah.

2766
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:41,460
That's what's going on.
It's just so unnecessary.

2767
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:44,910
Just the people on the ground could just
send it to the people on the ground,

2768
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,630
on the ground.
Why wouldn't you do breezy?

2769
02:06:46,810 --> 02:06:49,230
Yeah.
Especially in this day and age with the.

2770
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:51,300
But they still doing it.
It's very weird.

2771
02:06:51,390 --> 02:06:52,020
Yeah.
Yeah,

2772
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:53,790
it is.
They're going to have to do soMething.

2773
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:56,220
The model,
I don't know,

2774
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:57,473
like I said by pandora,
maybe start scooping up a internet 

2775
02:07:00,241 --> 02:07:02,370
companies,
but they're going to do.

2776
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:03,960
I think they're going to move towards 
that direction.

2777
02:07:03,961 --> 02:07:05,080
Yeah.
I think that's all.

2778
02:07:05,370 --> 02:07:06,203
You know what's really weird though,
it's like the Fucking am radio is still 

2779
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:12,750
a thing like,
like that's the weirdest thing to be.

2780
02:07:12,751 --> 02:07:17,400
The death knell for radio has been a,
it's been forever,

2781
02:07:17,401 --> 02:07:19,800
like the second another technology came 
out.

2782
02:07:19,801 --> 02:07:20,634
IT was like,
well I guess that's it for radio and 

2783
02:07:22,651 --> 02:07:23,810
television.
We have a,

2784
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:25,630
an amazing invention.
yeah.

2785
02:07:25,890 --> 02:07:29,880
And radio was supposed to be dead but 
it's just hangs in there.

2786
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:34,980
People just can't let it go.
Regular radio,

2787
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:36,180
especially a am

2788
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:37,840
man.
I remember as a kid,

2789
02:07:37,841 --> 02:07:42,820
my dad having the agm or like music on 
the am radio sounded like was coming out

2790
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:47,020
of a tin can static and shit.
And that was kind of all you had.

2791
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:52,030
I drove home a look like a year ago and 
just on a goof I decided to uh,

2792
02:07:52,450 --> 02:07:53,283
put on am radio and I was listening to 
an am radio show and I had a big smile 

2793
02:07:57,011 --> 02:07:59,800
on my face all the way home because it 
was like I was listening to the past.

2794
02:07:59,801 --> 02:08:00,251
Yeah.
Yeah.

2795
02:08:00,251 --> 02:08:01,380
it's like a time machine.
Right?

2796
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:02,223
I was some weird.
One of the local talk shows a weird 

2797
02:08:06,041 --> 02:08:06,874
local talk show in la where they were 
talking about traffic and the dodgers 

2798
02:08:10,421 --> 02:08:12,880
game and this and that.
It's archaic.

2799
02:08:12,881 --> 02:08:15,070
It's so strange.
Like first of all,

2800
02:08:15,071 --> 02:08:15,904
anything with anything that is trying to
inform you is just unnecessary at this 

2801
02:08:22,241 --> 02:08:22,950
point.

2802
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:27,950
Unless it's fake news,
the big cnn and fox news and everything.

2803
02:08:28,901 --> 02:08:31,240
Those will always be a fixture and 
stuff,

2804
02:08:31,241 --> 02:08:35,440
but local fucking news.
Do you really need the,

2805
02:08:35,570 --> 02:08:36,403
the the team that cares at 6:00
and it's all just shit that you've 

2806
02:08:40,901 --> 02:08:41,734
already seen online.
There's not one story that will be on 

2807
02:08:45,131 --> 02:08:47,980
the 6:00
news that I don't already know in depth.

2808
02:08:48,100 --> 02:08:51,670
It's also the lowest rung of show 
business in terms of competence.

2809
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:56,110
People that they're terrible at it and 
they're all drunks.

2810
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,920
It's hilarious,
dude.

2811
02:08:57,970 --> 02:09:02,230
I have never seen a group of people that
can drink more than fucking newspeople.

2812
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:03,233
They.
They just get hammered on instantly are 

2813
02:09:05,381 --> 02:09:07,180
miserable.
I think that's it.

2814
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:10,210
I think they're miserable.
Went through a whole thing when roseanne

2815
02:09:10,211 --> 02:09:13,330
was supposed to be on the podcast and 
right after she got fired,

2816
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:15,190
she announced she was going to come on 
the podcast.

2817
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:17,133
These fucking news casters started 
showing up where our old studio is 

2818
02:09:20,921 --> 02:09:21,754
actually.
They went to our old studio and they 

2819
02:09:22,931 --> 02:09:25,870
were parked out front with cameras and 
this is where I got.

2820
02:09:25,871 --> 02:09:27,220
I got upset.
I was like,

2821
02:09:27,221 --> 02:09:28,900
first of all,
you guys are terrible at this,

2822
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:29,763
and second of all,
you just assume that because you're 

2823
02:09:31,781 --> 02:09:33,690
there,
I have to talk to you [inaudible],

2824
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:34,793
so because you see me,
I'm going to say something to you 

2825
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:38,620
because you put your camera and your 
microphone face.

2826
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,150
It doesn't work that way.
Fuck face.

2827
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:42,460
I'm not going to talk to you.
You're not good at talking.

2828
02:09:42,910 --> 02:09:43,743
This is the reason why you do this job 
like a really good job doing this 

2829
02:09:49,121 --> 02:09:50,920
because you're not good at this.
You're not good at it.

2830
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:51,933
You will one day get a really good job 
doing this or you're just not good at 

2831
02:09:54,971 --> 02:09:55,270
it.

2832
02:09:55,270 --> 02:09:56,500
Yeah.
One of those,

2833
02:09:56,650 --> 02:09:58,840
because right now you're right here and 
I'm not talking to you.

2834
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:02,350
This is nonsense,
like you're holding this fucking camera.

2835
02:10:02,530 --> 02:10:05,560
Hi.
We're here with cbs for news.

2836
02:10:06,050 --> 02:10:06,883
Fuck outta here.
I don't have to talk to you because you 

2837
02:10:08,711 --> 02:10:10,000
have a camera in front of me.
Doesn't mind.

2838
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:10,953
We're going to have an interview now.
Sometimes they feel like you're 

2839
02:10:13,511 --> 02:10:16,360
obligated to address them.
Trying to come to my house.

2840
02:10:16,580 --> 02:10:17,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

2841
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:18,790
I've had that happen.
It's not fun.

2842
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:21,310
It's definitely not fun.
My neighbors,

2843
02:10:21,490 --> 02:10:22,323
I'm not talking to you.
They knocked on my neighbor's doors and 

2844
02:10:24,491 --> 02:10:27,700
they want to know about me and stuff and
if you think like,

2845
02:10:27,730 --> 02:10:28,563
like we deal with la or New York,
imagine what the news team in fucking 

2846
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:38,980
east allah bum fuck like.
That's gotta be the worst.

2847
02:10:38,981 --> 02:10:39,814
They are just terrible at what they do.
Terrible local news in some podunk fuck 

2848
02:10:44,211 --> 02:10:46,550
town is hilarious to watch.

2849
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:47,413
It's one of the things that comics have 
to do when they come into town to do 

2850
02:10:49,161 --> 02:10:49,994
local tv shows.
Morning the morning chats out thing as 

2851
02:10:53,421 --> 02:10:57,050
shitty as you think the vieW is the 
talk.

2852
02:10:57,300 --> 02:10:58,133
As shitty as though shows morning 
America fucking pens get together on 

2853
02:11:03,110 --> 02:11:06,470
these shows in like the local one in 
boise,

2854
02:11:06,471 --> 02:11:10,640
Idaho or dallas,
they're a thousand times worse,

2855
02:11:10,670 --> 02:11:12,640
worse,
just terrible death.

2856
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:13,380
And,
and I,

2857
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:18,320
I hate that there's such a double 
standard when one of them fucks up,

2858
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:22,460
when a newsperson fucks up,
they just apparently leave them alone.

2859
02:11:22,850 --> 02:11:25,730
Like where was everyone with a.
What's his name from,

2860
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:27,080
from uh,
an.

2861
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:28,760
Was it nbc?
Brian williams?

2862
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:30,170
Well,
Brian Williams,

2863
02:11:30,171 --> 02:11:31,770
they kinda got on.
Uh,

2864
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:32,681
but uh,
no.

2865
02:11:32,681 --> 02:11:33,171
Uh,
lauer.

2866
02:11:33,171 --> 02:11:34,280
Matt lauer.
Oh yeah.

2867
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:36,230
Like matt lauer.
It was in the news or anything.

2868
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:37,213
But where was,
where was the mike being shoved in matt 

2869
02:11:38,991 --> 02:11:41,660
lauer's face as he's trying to fucking 
go home or stuff that,

2870
02:11:41,661 --> 02:11:42,470
there was some of that.

2871
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:43,303
I think he just hid.
I mean he went straight to long island 

2872
02:11:45,441 --> 02:11:47,210
and went to the hamptons and he's never 
left,

2873
02:11:47,211 --> 02:11:50,040
but where theY camping out in front of 
his house like they did,

2874
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:51,530
they were,
yeah,

2875
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:52,453
they just,
he's just been banging divorces and 

2876
02:11:54,010 --> 02:11:56,660
riding a motorcycle to trying to get 
back on tv.

2877
02:11:56,780 --> 02:12:01,040
That is just stunning to me is how much 
money he made.

2878
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:01,930
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2879
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:03,650
Like I didn't know he was making that 
much money.

2880
02:12:03,651 --> 02:12:04,484
Like that is insane.
And for Years for a long fucking like a 

2881
02:12:08,210 --> 02:12:09,043
giant ranch in New Zealand,
it's like thousands of acres and you 

2882
02:12:11,850 --> 02:12:15,250
decide you need that.
It's so crazy because he's got a,

2883
02:12:15,370 --> 02:12:20,370
some access issues like the people that 
want to get to certain parts of the uh,

2884
02:12:20,930 --> 02:12:23,450
public land they have to go through his 
ranch.

2885
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:24,553
So there's like a,
an access issue like some sort of 

2886
02:12:26,990 --> 02:12:29,680
easement where these people were 
supposed to be able to drive through and

2887
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:30,593
they're fighting it off and he should 
just sit at his desk with that button 

2888
02:12:33,290 --> 02:12:34,220
that opens the door.

2889
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:37,490
But it lists a gate up so theY could get
through that button.

2890
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:39,410
There's a misconception about that 
button.

2891
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:41,540
They all had that button.
Yeah,

2892
02:12:41,541 --> 02:12:42,231
that was.
Yeah,

2893
02:12:42,231 --> 02:12:44,970
it was because they had big offices and 
they want to be able to lock their doors

2894
02:12:44,971 --> 02:12:47,090
suddenly interrupted on a phone call.
He wasn't,

2895
02:12:47,091 --> 02:12:47,924
so they could bang chicks in the office,
like women executives had that button 

2896
02:12:50,391 --> 02:12:51,021
to.
Oh,

2897
02:12:51,021 --> 02:12:51,711
okay.
Yeah,

2898
02:12:51,711 --> 02:12:54,650
but that's the thing that sounded very 
audrey,

2899
02:12:55,370 --> 02:12:58,310
audrey and d.
The media grabbed onto that and like,

2900
02:12:58,311 --> 02:12:59,131
oh my god,
he had a button,

2901
02:12:59,131 --> 02:13:00,890
the lock it.
You sit in there.

2902
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:04,660
When I fuck around being our rep that I 
want to fuck on,

2903
02:13:04,661 --> 02:13:07,880
I hit that button and just start fucking
some nervous girl.

2904
02:13:07,881 --> 02:13:11,570
Just seals that click goes,
oh fuck.

2905
02:13:11,571 --> 02:13:14,450
He hit the button.
There was a lot of that.

2906
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:18,890
That was accentuated like there was a 
one guest that brought in a bunch of sex

2907
02:13:18,891 --> 02:13:23,360
toys and he went back and he kept it in 
his office and he was like,

2908
02:13:23,390 --> 02:13:24,223
oh,
he keeps a bag of sex toys in his 

2909
02:13:25,011 --> 02:13:25,760
office.

2910
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:29,270
Like this shit in this office.
I got a flame thrower.

2911
02:13:29,690 --> 02:13:32,550
Okay.
Elan gave me a flame thrower.

2912
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:33,930
Yeah.
What am I going to do with it?

2913
02:13:33,931 --> 02:13:36,900
It's right there by the flame thrower in
his office.

2914
02:13:36,950 --> 02:13:38,400
Yes.
It's that kind of thing,

2915
02:13:38,401 --> 02:13:40,050
like if somebody gave me a bag of 
dildos,

2916
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:42,090
it will be right over there next to the 
flame thrower.

2917
02:13:42,091 --> 02:13:42,924
He has a bag of cheetos.
I made a conscious decision to throw it 

2918
02:13:46,051 --> 02:13:47,430
away,
or my wife found it.

2919
02:13:47,450 --> 02:13:51,600
It would wind up getting tossed,
but matt lauer decided to keep it in his

2920
02:13:51,601 --> 02:13:52,950
fucking closet.
Yeah.

2921
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:58,020
Apparently he gave some people some.
I think the guy was getting laid.

2922
02:13:58,220 --> 02:13:59,490
Yeah.
That's what I think.

2923
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:02,640
And I think a lot of what else happened.
The,

2924
02:14:02,641 --> 02:14:04,500
all the,
the details of it.

2925
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:08,850
It seems to me that it's all of it is 
like very blown out of proportion.

2926
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:10,110
I don't like that,
uh,

2927
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:10,973
that that's happening because everyone 
is being lumped into the harvey 

2928
02:14:13,651 --> 02:14:15,720
weinstein category,
which is the,

2929
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:19,080
that's the tip of the pyramid right 
there.

2930
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:20,311
The tip,
right?

2931
02:14:20,311 --> 02:14:21,930
Right.
Cosby is literal one.

2932
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:23,640
Yeah.
He's literally number one.

2933
02:14:24,530 --> 02:14:25,363
There was a woman who said this on,
I believe it was cnn or one of those 

2934
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:28,500
talk show.
She said,

2935
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:33,030
he may very well be the biggest serial 
rapist in history.

2936
02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:33,923
You even fucking build car.
Literally sitting back on my couch 

2937
02:14:37,381 --> 02:14:38,720
going,
fuck,

2938
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:44,810
bill cosby's the biggest serial rapist 
industry.

2939
02:14:46,110 --> 02:14:46,943
Wow.
A time machine would be wonderful just 

2940
02:14:49,681 --> 02:14:50,514
to see people's expressions when you 
tell him like what's happening in the 

2941
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:55,260
whole,
a celebrity,

2942
02:14:55,261 --> 02:14:56,910
a forum,
like like why?

2943
02:14:56,911 --> 02:14:57,744
What's cosby's doing?
Have you seen a photo of howard cosell 

2944
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:04,470
standing next to bruce jenner and oj 
simpson oj and it says,

2945
02:15:04,471 --> 02:15:09,471
I've seen the future and you're not 
going to believe this fucking crazy.

2946
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:12,330
Because we.
When we were kids,

2947
02:15:12,331 --> 02:15:15,090
we used to watch the cosby show when it 
was,

2948
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:19,470
when he was bill cosby,
the standup comedian that will go on hbo

2949
02:15:19,471 --> 02:15:20,304
and everybody loved him.
He was america's america's dad right 

2950
02:15:23,491 --> 02:15:24,930
there.
The cosby show,

2951
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:30,350
revolutionary on television.
He was at that time raping women at that

2952
02:15:31,091 --> 02:15:33,270
time.
It's insane.

2953
02:15:33,390 --> 02:15:35,430
Not just raping them,
but drugging.

2954
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:36,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

2955
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:40,590
And it in and friends,
daughters liKe he knew.

2956
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:42,420
Come on over.
I'll help you with your career.

2957
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:43,590
Wow.
Plump.

2958
02:15:44,070 --> 02:15:44,903
Yeah.
Dropped two in your fucking drink and 

2959
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,940
you feeling okay.
Put your feet up,

2960
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:49,740
put your feet up,
and they'd be like,

2961
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,000
okay,
I'll move it.

2962
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:51,933
Good.
That's when I stick my dick in your 

2963
02:15:52,411 --> 02:15:53,760
mouth.
In that hazy,

2964
02:15:53,970 --> 02:15:54,803
like a few of them just hazely regained 
consciousness for a minute and just 

2965
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:03,090
remember seeing old bill pound in a way 
with that fucking flounder.

2966
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:08,090
I think he got the I later in life 
apparently.

2967
02:16:09,111 --> 02:16:09,871
Yeah.
Yeah.

2968
02:16:09,871 --> 02:16:10,980
I think,
I'm not sure.

2969
02:16:10,981 --> 02:16:13,470
I thought they were using that as kind 
of a sympathy thing,

2970
02:16:13,471 --> 02:16:17,220
but he looks pretty fucking blind him to
the same jail they sent whitey bulger.

2971
02:16:17,580 --> 02:16:20,730
Oh wow.
How about that bucket bags?

2972
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:22,910
Full light and he's a.
He was,

2973
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:25,170
what,
95 or something like that.

2974
02:16:25,171 --> 02:16:26,460
Why do you build culture?
Was he that?

2975
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:29,040
I think it was that fucking all,
like in his nineties.

2976
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:30,153
That's all.
That's a gRudge that someone held onto 

2977
02:16:32,111 --> 02:16:35,170
for quite a while while the guy hated 
rats apparently.

2978
02:16:35,450 --> 02:16:36,283
And that was the thing that whitey 
bulger all throughout hiS time of 

2979
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:41,740
running the irish mob was ratting people
out the air.

2980
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:42,873
That's what was really crazy.
He was another guy just like we were 

2981
02:16:44,621 --> 02:16:45,750
tAlking about.
Um,

2982
02:16:45,850 --> 02:16:47,350
uh,
the fuck's his name.

2983
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:48,660
The italian guy?
Yeah.

2984
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:50,200
Gotti got no.
The other one.

2985
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:54,160
Oh no.
He was in the mob.

2986
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:57,550
Ratting out other people in the mob 
while he was murdering people.

2987
02:16:57,580 --> 02:16:58,390
yeah.
Yeah.

2988
02:16:58,390 --> 02:17:01,860
Like the fbi allowed him to sell drugs 
and do a lot.

2989
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:06,340
He won the lottery twice while he was 
doing this,

2990
02:17:06,341 --> 02:17:07,174
you know,
how that works and how the [inaudible] 

2991
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:14,140
would win the lottery and he would use 
that as a way to show income.

2992
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:15,243
So he would pay them for their lottery 
ticket or steal it from him or whatever 

2993
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:21,070
they did it.
And then he would say,

2994
02:17:21,071 --> 02:17:21,904
look,
I won the lottery and then he would win 

2995
02:17:23,411 --> 02:17:26,200
the lottery so that when he would have 
all this money laundered,

2996
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:30,640
it could avoid tax evasion charges.
That way I'll get proof of income.

2997
02:17:31,190 --> 02:17:33,640
Doesn't want to get that boat.
Where'd you get that cadillac?

2998
02:17:33,641 --> 02:17:34,660
Where'd you get that house?
Yeah,

2999
02:17:34,661 --> 02:17:35,494
yeah,
yeah.

3000
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:36,441
That's,
uh,

3001
02:17:36,441 --> 02:17:40,630
that's fucked up twice now.
Both live to win it twice.

3002
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:41,770
He was,
uh,

3003
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:42,701
yeah,
he,

3004
02:17:42,701 --> 02:17:43,481
he was,
uh,

3005
02:17:43,481 --> 02:17:48,481
the fbi was helping him too.
Obviously they were given up competitors

3006
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:50,250
and uh,
well they,

3007
02:17:50,251 --> 02:17:51,084
they,
they were responsible probably for some 

3008
02:17:52,331 --> 02:17:53,200
murders.
Yeah.

3009
02:17:53,201 --> 02:17:54,034
Yeah.
they would bring people to him like 

3010
02:17:55,541 --> 02:17:56,590
that.
That was the thing like,

3011
02:17:56,591 --> 02:17:59,110
hey,
we're not going to kill anyone but we'll

3012
02:17:59,111 --> 02:18:03,010
bring this guy to you so you could have 
a little chit chat and you know,

3013
02:18:03,070 --> 02:18:05,110
you're driving the guy to,
to his death.

3014
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:06,933
Pretty much.
So he was living in an apartment in 

3015
02:18:08,141 --> 02:18:10,450
santa monica with some girl,
just talked a lot.

3016
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:12,840
And apparently she was yelling at him 
and that's,

3017
02:18:12,841 --> 02:18:14,910
that's how he got arrested.
Like it,

3018
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:19,060
like a domestic.
There was some screaming and yelling and

3019
02:18:19,061 --> 02:18:22,390
they were weird and that was what got 
people looking at them like who the fuck

3020
02:18:22,391 --> 02:18:23,224
are these people?

3021
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:24,490
And then they start.
I mean,

3022
02:18:24,610 --> 02:18:27,400
he wasn't even the like hide in Montana 
or anything.

3023
02:18:27,430 --> 02:18:27,951
No,
no,

3024
02:18:27,951 --> 02:18:30,820
it wasn't even rigHt out there on a 
ranch somewhere in the middle of nowhere

3025
02:18:30,821 --> 02:18:31,654
when no one's going to be suspicious.
He's in fucking santa monica in an 

3026
02:18:34,061 --> 02:18:37,270
apartment that is fucked up.
Crazy.

3027
02:18:37,271 --> 02:18:40,880
I don't understand like,
how it's got to be the,

3028
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:45,370
the most stressful life to lead.
Just on the run.

3029
02:18:45,371 --> 02:18:46,670
I watched that,
uh,

3030
02:18:47,050 --> 02:18:50,180
some of those shows like cold case files
and uh,

3031
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:51,550
when they find these people,
you know,

3032
02:18:51,551 --> 02:18:52,384
the inmateS are saying about the brutal 
prison hit on What he boulder chop chop 

3033
02:18:57,181 --> 02:19:00,070
off the tongue.
His eyes out.

3034
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:04,010
Oh my god.
That's like 89 or 89.

3035
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:06,550
Jesus christ.
Yeah.

3036
02:19:06,551 --> 02:19:09,760
It's definitely got what he had coming 
to them.

3037
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:12,010
It shouldn't.
I don't see how anybody could argue that

3038
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:15,460
apparently so no sympathy.
He says shit.

3039
02:19:15,670 --> 02:19:17,290
Just amazing.
And he's 89.

3040
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:19,680
Made it to 89.
80 nine.

3041
02:19:19,710 --> 02:19:21,460
What was patrice like 40 when he died?
Yeah.

3042
02:19:21,461 --> 02:19:22,310
Yeah,
yeah.

3043
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:23,540
How's that work?
I,

3044
02:19:23,541 --> 02:19:25,660
I have no idea.
But yeah,

3045
02:19:25,661 --> 02:19:28,010
I mean he,
he been

3046
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:31,580
looking over shoulder constantly while 
still in his wheelchair.

3047
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:32,414
He was beaten to death with what inmate 
call shank schlocks a lock in a sock 

3048
02:19:37,770 --> 02:19:42,770
that is kind of a dr seuss weapon while 
in his wheelchair before possibly having

3049
02:19:43,731 --> 02:19:47,240
his eyes pow partially gouged out with 
shanks.

3050
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:51,320
Oh fuck.
That's some real sandlands tried to chop

3051
02:19:51,321 --> 02:19:53,250
off his tongue.
Wow.

3052
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:54,133
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes jailhouse justice actually 

3053
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:59,120
happens.
You don't,

3054
02:19:59,121 --> 02:19:59,751
you don't.
Uh,

3055
02:19:59,751 --> 02:20:02,020
you don't think it will.
But then it does sometimes,

3056
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:03,590
sometimes,
sometimes,

3057
02:20:03,620 --> 02:20:06,230
sometimes people get what's coming to 
them.

3058
02:20:06,650 --> 02:20:08,200
How do we get on the subject of why the 
boundary?

3059
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:10,250
I don't know.
We always,

3060
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:12,750
we just ramble about this stuff.
They love it.

3061
02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:18,140
So I love that you've established your 
own sort of media company.

3062
02:20:18,650 --> 02:20:22,250
I love that you decided to start your 
own network,

3063
02:20:23,380 --> 02:20:24,320
but is it,
is it,

3064
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:28,400
are there challenges like what we do is 
pretty simple because we just put it out

3065
02:20:28,401 --> 02:20:29,690
there and then we put ads on it.

3066
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:30,360
Right.
You know,

3067
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,910
and,
or youtube puts ads on it.

3068
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:34,580
But is it,
is it challenging to like,

3069
02:20:35,050 --> 02:20:36,610
I mean you,
you have a bunch of people.

3070
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:37,453
Like when I was there,
other folks were coming in and they had 

3071
02:20:39,141 --> 02:20:42,750
their shows in the studio as well and 
they had you changed your green screen,

3072
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:43,603
you know,
you should change the most convenient 

3073
02:20:45,261 --> 02:20:46,094
way to kind of.
Instead of having a different set for 

3074
02:20:47,631 --> 02:20:50,450
every show,
it's a green screen and then we just pop

3075
02:20:50,451 --> 02:20:51,284
it in a pop in the background.
We could do some pretty funny things 

3076
02:20:54,291 --> 02:20:55,460
with it too.
We've done that.

3077
02:20:55,461 --> 02:21:00,340
I did a reading last week of a part of 
my book and uh,

3078
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:01,393
we went to an establishing shot of a 
cabin and I moved to a chair behind the 

3079
02:21:04,311 --> 02:21:07,440
green screen and it's just made by a 
little fire burning and I.

3080
02:21:07,870 --> 02:21:09,010
Oh,
welcome.

3081
02:21:09,250 --> 02:21:11,390
I didn't,
I didn't expect you and you know,

3082
02:21:11,391 --> 02:21:13,850
so it's kind of fun to be creative with 
the thing.

3083
02:21:13,880 --> 02:21:15,350
Um,
other than that,

3084
02:21:15,351 --> 02:21:17,210
yeah,
there are a lot of challenges.

3085
02:21:17,211 --> 02:21:19,130
It's a I,
I am not,

3086
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:22,520
I am in front of the mic guy.
That's it.

3087
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:27,440
I don't really like any of the other 
parts of the business.

3088
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:28,150
This,
it,

3089
02:21:28,150 --> 02:21:32,180
it's weird because this is the ceo of 
the business or I'm the guy.

3090
02:21:32,181 --> 02:21:33,014
Keith though is the guy.
I've delegated a lot of the 

3091
02:21:35,331 --> 02:21:38,570
responsibility as to the tech end of 
everything and uh,

3092
02:21:38,810 --> 02:21:39,643
finding the people we need to run 
equipment and stuff over the course of 

3093
02:21:42,021 --> 02:21:45,720
the years and it's worked out very well.
Um,

3094
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:47,460
but,
but it is one of those things.

3095
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:49,550
It's,
it's two companies.

3096
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:50,443
You have the entertainment that's going 
into the microphone and then all the 

3097
02:21:53,331 --> 02:21:55,370
shit you need to get that to the people.

3098
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:58,130
And the business model and,
and you know,

3099
02:21:58,131 --> 02:22:01,580
billing and all that shit that I can't 
fucking be bothered.

3100
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:05,720
I have video games to play.
I can't be bothered with that shit.

3101
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:08,960
So you operate on,
it's a subscription.

3102
02:22:08,961 --> 02:22:11,540
People pay by the month and you get a 
ton of shows.

3103
02:22:11,541 --> 02:22:13,400
They get the Mike Ward show.
Yeah.

3104
02:22:13,401 --> 02:22:14,060
Yeah.
Uh,

3105
02:22:14,060 --> 02:22:15,560
Mike Ward,
who was in here last week.

3106
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:16,453
Yeah.
And they get a aaron and gino doing in 

3107
02:22:18,681 --> 02:22:19,514
hot waters,
our morning show and they are just out 

3108
02:22:20,931 --> 02:22:21,764
of fucking control.
They're the one show that I watched 

3109
02:22:23,681 --> 02:22:25,290
sometimes they go like,
oh really?

3110
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:26,700
Wow.
That's,

3111
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:28,420
I wouldn't do that.
Yeah,

3112
02:22:28,430 --> 02:22:28,921
yeah,
yeah.

3113
02:22:28,921 --> 02:22:29,570
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3114
02:22:29,570 --> 02:22:31,490
They're brutal comics.
Uh,

3115
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:32,101
yeah.
Yeah.

3116
02:22:32,101 --> 02:22:34,950
The comics in uh,
in New York and then they tour around.

3117
02:22:35,350 --> 02:22:36,990
I'm really funny guys.
Then,

3118
02:22:36,991 --> 02:22:38,160
um,
so this is the,

3119
02:22:38,190 --> 02:22:40,110
this is the page with all show on it.
Yeah.

3120
02:22:40,111 --> 02:22:40,944
I,
I pilfered a bill schultz and joanne 

3121
02:22:42,871 --> 02:22:44,520
know socinski from fox news.

3122
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:47,680
They used to be on fox news,
a red eye and stuff.

3123
02:22:48,190 --> 02:22:50,060
East side.
Dave is a,

3124
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:54,720
an insane motherfucker from the old ron 
and fez show what's in hot water.

3125
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:56,880
And hot water is the morning show.
That's a.

3126
02:22:56,890 --> 02:22:58,260
Yeah,
that's aaron and gino.

3127
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:01,920
Kevin brennan,
who is just a mental patient.

3128
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:04,470
Uh,
kevin's scares me.

3129
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:06,790
He yells a lot.
I,

3130
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:09,810
I come into the studio and I just hear 
his voice booming,

3131
02:23:09,811 --> 02:23:14,670
yelling and I get an anxiety attack.
Like it's my dad yelling at mom back in,

3132
02:23:14,671 --> 02:23:16,200
in the,
in the old days a.

3133
02:23:16,670 --> 02:23:17,491
Yeah.
It was just a,

3134
02:23:17,491 --> 02:23:18,031
uh,
you know,

3135
02:23:18,031 --> 02:23:18,864
we,
we were always looking for a many shows 

3136
02:23:20,491 --> 02:23:21,324
you have on shows that fit.
I don't know how many that is available 

3137
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:26,370
to stream.
Like anytime you want.

3138
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:27,001
Yeah,
yeah.

3139
02:23:27,001 --> 02:23:29,610
Every show.
Most of the shows go out live.

3140
02:23:29,611 --> 02:23:33,590
I like the element of just a little 
danger there of,

3141
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:35,500
of being live as it goes out.

3142
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:39,300
I like that.
I don't know what it is,

3143
02:23:39,301 --> 02:23:40,134
but just knowing you could edit 
something might make you a little lazy 

3144
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:46,170
as you're doing it.
You can't stop.

3145
02:23:46,230 --> 02:23:47,063
You have to keep calling.
Jamie brought it up like it feels 

3146
02:23:48,991 --> 02:23:50,940
different and we've done shows that 
aren't live.

3147
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:52,020
Yeah.
Yeah it does.

3148
02:23:52,021 --> 02:23:53,870
If something happened with streaming at 
one point in time,

3149
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:54,773
we fucked up and we couldn't stream,
so we just edited it and put it or a 

3150
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:00,000
filmed in advance rather than put it up 
later.

3151
02:24:00,210 --> 02:24:01,950
But it was like,
is this field feels weird?

3152
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:03,750
It does.
It's because there's a net.

3153
02:24:04,050 --> 02:24:05,400
There's a net down there.
You could,

3154
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:07,050
you could leave.
If you had to take a piss,

3155
02:24:07,051 --> 02:24:07,461
you could go,
hey,

3156
02:24:07,461 --> 02:24:08,370
I gotta take a piss.
I go,

3157
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:09,480
you know,
this is,

3158
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:11,160
you're going out like,
this is it.

3159
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:11,890
Hi.
Hey,

3160
02:24:11,890 --> 02:24:13,560
here it is a.

3161
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:14,640
I like,
I like that.

3162
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:15,813
Yeah.
That's something that there's a feeling 

3163
02:24:17,011 --> 02:24:18,780
that there's people listening right now,
right?

3164
02:24:18,810 --> 02:24:20,490
Yeah.
And everything's archived.

3165
02:24:20,491 --> 02:24:25,491
So a subscribers can get a all the past 
shows from all the channels available.

3166
02:24:27,151 --> 02:24:29,340
Can they download audio as well as 
video?

3167
02:24:29,341 --> 02:24:29,970
Yeah,
yeah.

3168
02:24:29,970 --> 02:24:31,640
Audio only,
um,

3169
02:24:32,050 --> 02:24:33,150
uh,
audio and video.

3170
02:24:33,151 --> 02:24:33,720
Yeah,
it's,

3171
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:35,790
it's a,
we give a lot of options.

3172
02:24:36,150 --> 02:24:36,983
Uh,
we went with subscriber based because 

3173
02:24:40,321 --> 02:24:43,290
when I got the boot from a serious years
ago,

3174
02:24:44,130 --> 02:24:44,963
uh,
I couldn't imagine people want me to be 

3175
02:24:47,311 --> 02:24:50,100
hawking their products in the first 
place.

3176
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:51,473
Uh,
and,

3177
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:54,960
and I didn't want to be beholden to 
sponsors,

3178
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:59,310
I can't have anyone telling me what I 
can and can't say anymore,

3179
02:24:59,550 --> 02:25:00,383
just ain't going to happen.
But is there an issue trying to get 

3180
02:25:02,551 --> 02:25:03,270
people like,
uh,

3181
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:04,103
I had a friend who was on radio and they
left and went to do a podcast nana 

3182
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:08,580
subscription podcast.

3183
02:25:08,610 --> 02:25:09,750
Yeah.
And he,

3184
02:25:09,810 --> 02:25:12,420
what he was saying is,
it's really difficult to grow.

3185
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:13,313
Look,
you have to keep those people that you 

3186
02:25:14,191 --> 02:25:17,790
have to keep them happy and he,
they would do things to engage with them

3187
02:25:17,791 --> 02:25:20,160
and they would do like little events 
where they'd go to a bar,

3188
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:23,200
meet everybody and do a show from there.
He said,

3189
02:25:23,201 --> 02:25:24,034
but it's really hard to grow because 
people don't want to pay when there's 

3190
02:25:26,351 --> 02:25:28,240
all these different shows they could 
just get for free.

3191
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:29,560
Yeah,
that's a,

3192
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:30,423
that's always a challenge.
But there's also the commodity that 

3193
02:25:34,661 --> 02:25:37,180
people can't get anywhere else is 
entertaining.

3194
02:25:37,210 --> 02:25:38,043
Shows like you could have a free show 
that sucks and there's plenty of those 

3195
02:25:43,061 --> 02:25:44,590
out there.
Uh,

3196
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:49,090
but if you're good at what you do and 
you already have an audience,

3197
02:25:49,091 --> 02:25:52,870
because I say it all the time,
corola had the greatest line once he was

3198
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:54,890
being interviewed in so and said,
uh,

3199
02:25:55,180 --> 02:25:58,840
how do you,
how do you make a successful podcast?

3200
02:25:58,840 --> 02:25:59,321
He goes,
oh,

3201
02:25:59,321 --> 02:26:00,340
okay.
Rule number one,

3202
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:02,950
be famous.
And I was like,

3203
02:26:02,951 --> 02:26:03,940
yeah,
you gotta.

3204
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:07,360
So I figured if we get up and running in
a month,

3205
02:26:07,430 --> 02:26:08,450
and then keith,
uh,

3206
02:26:08,650 --> 02:26:09,483
figured it out that we could hold onto a
lot of the o and a audience that would 

3207
02:26:13,781 --> 02:26:16,450
come over and subscribe.
Get it quick,

3208
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:17,410
get up.
Yeah.

3209
02:26:17,411 --> 02:26:18,244
And that's why.
Thank god I had that studio already 

3210
02:26:19,691 --> 02:26:21,420
built in my basement.
Yeah.

3211
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:23,710
I was able to.
All we needed was the logistics of,

3212
02:26:23,711 --> 02:26:24,544
of pumping it out onto the internet in a
bigger number than I was doing at three 

3213
02:26:27,401 --> 02:26:30,130
in the morning.
Were doing some of them outside too.

3214
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:30,941
Yeah,
yeah.

3215
02:26:30,941 --> 02:26:34,450
We'd set up the camera out by the pool.
Like my first guest was dice,

3216
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:36,080
which was hilarious.
Yeah.

3217
02:26:36,081 --> 02:26:37,360
Yeah.
Dice came by,

3218
02:26:37,361 --> 02:26:42,361
we sat by the pool and then later on he 
went downstairs in my basement,

3219
02:26:42,761 --> 02:26:46,600
I that karaoke stage and he was singing 
elvis karaoke songs.

3220
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:47,433
It was hilarious.
And that's one of those voluntary like 

3221
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:54,240
dice is in my basement singing.
Elvis did that fucking awesome.

3222
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:57,100
Uh,
but yeah,

3223
02:26:57,101 --> 02:27:00,580
so,
so that model works for us and it's been

3224
02:27:00,581 --> 02:27:04,210
working,
but I'm kind of seeing a,

3225
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:07,690
you gotta keep on your toes in 
especially a technology based business.

3226
02:27:07,691 --> 02:27:09,070
We were just talking about satellite 
radio,

3227
02:27:09,071 --> 02:27:09,904
like you don't,
you just can't tell what's going to 

3228
02:27:11,021 --> 02:27:13,330
happen.
You really gotta kind of look for future

3229
02:27:13,331 --> 02:27:15,400
trends and whatnot.
And uh,

3230
02:27:15,430 --> 02:27:16,263
maybe more of a hybrid thing because 
it's a balancing act of bringing new 

3231
02:27:19,571 --> 02:27:20,404
people in and like you said,
keeping the people that are there 

3232
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:23,853
already,
but bringing new people in with some 

3233
02:27:25,121 --> 02:27:25,954
free content.
So maybe get tiered subscription thing 

3234
02:27:28,571 --> 02:27:31,030
where there is a free level with 
sponsors.

3235
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:32,890
Uh,
but then a tiered,

3236
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:38,100
a premium level with the material that 
we've already had.

3237
02:27:38,260 --> 02:27:41,560
Maybe a past shows or something or extra
content.

3238
02:27:41,770 --> 02:27:42,381
But,
so we're,

3239
02:27:42,381 --> 02:27:46,600
we're always trying to think of what 
might be a good option.

3240
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:51,130
When I first fired this thing up,
we had no fucking clue.

3241
02:27:51,370 --> 02:27:52,203
I mean this was usually,
you would kind of do some kind of a 

3242
02:27:54,701 --> 02:27:59,701
research testing or whatever,
marketing analysis of day parts and shit

3243
02:28:00,041 --> 02:28:01,990
like that.
And I just was like,

3244
02:28:02,090 --> 02:28:04,120
I could,
I could be here by 4:00

3245
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:06,280
PM.
How long is this show going to be?

3246
02:28:07,180 --> 02:28:08,920
Six.
Two hours.

3247
02:28:08,921 --> 02:28:10,270
Four to six.
I could,

3248
02:28:10,540 --> 02:28:14,260
I could go out at six and then I don't 
have to be there until 4:00

3249
02:28:14,260 --> 02:28:15,400
PM.
It's fucking easy.

3250
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:18,310
Still lets me party a monday through 
friday.

3251
02:28:18,490 --> 02:28:19,323
Fuck that.
I want the three day weekend all the 

3252
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:21,853
time for the rest of my life.
So that's what we do monday through 

3253
02:28:24,651 --> 02:28:25,484
thursday.
And then we have programming on friday 

3254
02:28:27,531 --> 02:28:30,750
in the slot that I'm supposed to begin,
uh,

3255
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:31,633
during the week.

3256
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:33,470
So it just,
I wanted,

3257
02:28:33,890 --> 02:28:38,890
I didn't want to fucking be driving 
myself like that forever.

3258
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,220
So cut back on the hours,
the days and it worked.

3259
02:28:43,221 --> 02:28:44,240
So,
you know,

3260
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:46,400
I'm very happy with that.
But again,

3261
02:28:46,401 --> 02:28:47,234
you know,
we're always assessing and seeing what 

3262
02:28:47,961 --> 02:28:51,590
we could do to kind of build it because 
it is that trade off of audience,

3263
02:28:51,860 --> 02:28:52,693
like obviously we're not going to get as
many people watching on a subscriber 

3264
02:28:55,401 --> 02:28:58,550
based than we would if it was free with 
spots,

3265
02:28:58,551 --> 02:28:59,750
but,
you know,

3266
02:28:59,751 --> 02:29:04,751
do you want to cut down on the paid 
subscribers and boost it up and then how

3267
02:29:04,911 --> 02:29:07,940
far do I,
I go with advertisers where somebody can

3268
02:29:07,941 --> 02:29:08,774
call them and fuck me over now and do I 
truly have free speech now or just free 

3269
02:29:13,011 --> 02:29:15,650
as I can be a what?
A subscriber base.

3270
02:29:15,651 --> 02:29:16,550
So,
uh,

3271
02:29:16,551 --> 02:29:18,860
it's a balancing act.
I see what you're saying.

3272
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:19,693
Look,
you don't want to totally abandoned the 

3273
02:29:20,571 --> 02:29:23,420
subscriber model because then you're at 
the mercy of subscribe,

3274
02:29:23,450 --> 02:29:24,283
have a advert of advertisers and it gets
like we have advertisers now we have a 

3275
02:29:27,981 --> 02:29:29,190
couple of them,
uh,

3276
02:29:29,270 --> 02:29:32,900
that we pop maybe two spots on a show 
and I do.

3277
02:29:32,990 --> 02:29:34,520
They're all live reads.
So I,

3278
02:29:34,530 --> 02:29:37,970
I make them fun and funny and people 
like,

3279
02:29:37,971 --> 02:29:40,670
I learned that from howard years ago 
when howard,

3280
02:29:40,671 --> 02:29:41,504
we'd go to spots before he was 
syndicated to when he had all the time 

3281
02:29:43,851 --> 02:29:44,684
in the world,
sometimes you didn't even know he was 

3282
02:29:46,731 --> 02:29:49,010
still in a commercial break.
It was just funny.

3283
02:29:49,310 --> 02:29:52,970
So I try to keep it light and fun and 
add in things.

3284
02:29:52,971 --> 02:29:55,190
Uh,
so it doesn't feel so intrusive,

3285
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:58,100
but I don't live in thai by sponsors.
It's not,

3286
02:29:58,101 --> 02:30:01,580
it's kind of supplements the subscribers
stuff.

3287
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:02,890
So,
uh,

3288
02:30:03,410 --> 02:30:05,540
that works.
And I don't know,

3289
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:10,370
maybe I'm paranoid because of my past 
that,

3290
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:11,233
uh,
that sponsors might get pissed at what 

3291
02:30:13,011 --> 02:30:13,460
I'm saying.

3292
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:14,293
But when I look at the shows,
especially the shows I've been doing in 

3293
02:30:16,191 --> 02:30:19,970
the past year or so,
they're not as harsh as they were.

3294
02:30:19,971 --> 02:30:23,570
I was really fucking angry.
Uh,

3295
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,640
like five years ago when I started this 
whole thing.

3296
02:30:25,641 --> 02:30:27,230
I can't believe it's almost five years 
already,

3297
02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:28,513
uh,
that I've been doing this a compound 

3298
02:30:29,061 --> 02:30:30,370
media.
And uh,

3299
02:30:30,890 --> 02:30:35,890
I was just pissed and the show was a 
platform of like venting and,

3300
02:30:35,990 --> 02:30:37,790
and revenge.
And like,

3301
02:30:37,791 --> 02:30:38,624
I just,
I wanted to fucking yell and be pissed 

3302
02:30:41,421 --> 02:30:45,200
about things and bang the desk about 
politics and society and,

3303
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:46,810
and uh,
it,

3304
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:51,340
it came off as very angry.
Uh,

3305
02:30:51,980 --> 02:30:55,400
and then as,
as time went on,

3306
02:30:55,401 --> 02:30:59,600
I realized like people would tell him he
got dude just be funny,

3307
02:30:59,610 --> 02:31:02,750
like just joke about shit and you don't 
have to be serious.

3308
02:31:02,751 --> 02:31:05,540
Like I thought for some reason I had to 
do almost like a political show,

3309
02:31:06,050 --> 02:31:06,883
um,
because of the fact that you had gone 

3310
02:31:08,061 --> 02:31:08,930
through so much shit.

3311
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:10,910
Yeah,
I was resentful.

3312
02:31:10,911 --> 02:31:12,320
I was pissed.
And,

3313
02:31:12,340 --> 02:31:14,090
and you know,
it's a,

3314
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:17,360
it's one of those things that really 
carried over onto the show,

3315
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:20,130
but the past couple of years,
I guess it's been,

3316
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:22,103
especially with bringing artie lange on 
board for the eight months he was with 

3317
02:31:24,541 --> 02:31:25,410
me,
uh,

3318
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:26,423
it's very difficult to get into any kind
of a commentary on society with hardy 

3319
02:31:30,091 --> 02:31:33,270
lank sitting there.
It was odd.

3320
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:34,530
It was great.
I mean,

3321
02:31:34,531 --> 02:31:35,364
you know,
the,

3322
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:37,980
the preface,
everyone gives us fucking love already.

3323
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:40,740
He's hilariously funny.
Uh,

3324
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:45,210
so quick and just a goofy knock around 
regular guy a,

3325
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:47,870
but the demon span,
the demons.

3326
02:31:47,900 --> 02:31:51,150
It was,
it was kind of rough to deal with.

3327
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:54,060
Like I said,
I'm a relaxed guy if already didn't show

3328
02:31:54,061 --> 02:31:56,230
up one day I do the show myself.
Didn't need,

3329
02:31:56,290 --> 02:31:59,590
do the show with opi for awhile.
No,

3330
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:00,433
he was a guest on the show and,
and I guess be approached him to be a 

3331
02:32:04,651 --> 02:32:06,050
cohost or something to eat.

3332
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:08,100
He said no.
Um,

3333
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:09,690
but yeah,
it was never part of the show.

3334
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:11,300
I thought he was going to be part of the
show.

3335
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:12,173
Yeah,
there was kind of a rumor going around 

3336
02:32:13,111 --> 02:32:14,610
for awhile.
Uh,

3337
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:15,473
so when he came on I was like,
it's not going to kill me if he doesn't 

3338
02:32:18,361 --> 02:32:23,190
show up for a day every so often because
I'll just do the show myself.

3339
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:24,273
Uh,
but it turned out to be a little more 

3340
02:32:26,251 --> 02:32:28,230
than that.
And there was some days that were really

3341
02:32:28,231 --> 02:32:32,250
good and other days where it was a 
little frayed around the edges and uh,

3342
02:32:32,310 --> 02:32:33,570
you know,
redundant.

3343
02:32:33,690 --> 02:32:37,020
He's got different kinds of demons.
Boza bub,

3344
02:32:37,650 --> 02:32:40,080
he's got like the main demon.
He really does,

3345
02:32:40,081 --> 02:32:43,470
man,
and it's so fucking sad to say because,

3346
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:46,830
I mean,
there's no question about the talent.

3347
02:32:46,831 --> 02:32:49,260
There he is.
He's hilarious and a great guy.

3348
02:32:49,290 --> 02:32:51,160
Great guy.
You'll always hear that.

3349
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:52,170
You always hear that.

3350
02:32:52,390 --> 02:32:54,390
I,
I remember when we hired them,

3351
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:55,253
it was a,
I was at the comedy cellar and dave 

3352
02:32:57,801 --> 02:32:59,070
attell,
can you let go?

3353
02:32:59,071 --> 02:33:02,260
So you're working with rd.
I'm like,

3354
02:33:02,261 --> 02:33:03,000
yeah.
He goes,

3355
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:03,833
well,
welcome to the wonderful world of the 

3356
02:33:04,741 --> 02:33:05,574
3:00
AM phone calls and not being able to 

3357
02:33:08,011 --> 02:33:10,320
find him like,
oh fuck,

3358
02:33:10,321 --> 02:33:11,810
what did we get ourselves into?
And,

3359
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:13,740
and that's kinda what we've got 
ourselves into.

3360
02:33:13,741 --> 02:33:14,940
But again,
I mean,

3361
02:33:14,941 --> 02:33:16,930
I had a great time.
His,

3362
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:20,520
he's one of the funniest motherfuckers,
especially on a mic like that.

3363
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:24,930
Who would think that when jackie marlin 
left the stern show,

3364
02:33:24,931 --> 02:33:28,990
they'd be able to replace them with 
somebody that was just funny as fuck.

3365
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:33,480
Have legendary shows with,
with a rod on.

3366
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:35,340
And um,
you know,

3367
02:33:35,350 --> 02:33:37,310
he,
he definitely earned a place in,

3368
02:33:37,311 --> 02:33:39,840
in broadcast history,
but we just,

3369
02:33:39,841 --> 02:33:40,674
you know,
after eight months it got a little too 

3370
02:33:41,611 --> 02:33:46,290
crazy to unpredictable and you need some
predictability.

3371
02:33:46,290 --> 02:33:47,760
What was,
what was bad about it?

3372
02:33:48,270 --> 02:33:51,720
Well,
it was the attendance issue was a little

3373
02:33:51,721 --> 02:33:53,550
odd.
I'm like a principal.

3374
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:54,301
Yeah,
yeah.

3375
02:33:54,301 --> 02:33:56,100
The attendance.
He wasn't,

3376
02:33:56,101 --> 02:33:57,730
he was tardy.
Uh,

3377
02:33:58,110 --> 02:34:00,570
and,
and there were some days he was fucking,

3378
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:02,280
just,
most days it was awesome,

3379
02:34:02,700 --> 02:34:04,710
but there were some days where,
you know,

3380
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:08,970
the heads down,
it was kind of kind of a little iffy and

3381
02:34:08,971 --> 02:34:10,140
you know,
regardless,

3382
02:34:10,141 --> 02:34:12,300
I know he knows that too.
I mean he's,

3383
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:14,220
he's,
he lives in that body,

3384
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:15,180
so,
you know,

3385
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:17,590
he knows it.
So it was a little odd.

3386
02:34:17,700 --> 02:34:19,690
Um,
and then we picked up dave landau,

3387
02:34:19,691 --> 02:34:20,524
who's a young comic out of detroit.
He filled in a couple of times when we 

3388
02:34:25,601 --> 02:34:26,434
had them as guests on the show.
And then he filled in a couple of times 

3389
02:34:27,821 --> 02:34:32,140
during a few sabbaticals that he was 
away for a week or so.

3390
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:36,940
And me and dave just hit it off.
He's got a great sense of humor.

3391
02:34:37,150 --> 02:34:39,940
He's a little twisted.
He's got a great backstory.

3392
02:34:40,210 --> 02:34:43,500
The guy was just a fucking piece of shit
for a long time.

3393
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:47,670
His stories about like,
drunk driving crashed.

3394
02:34:47,690 --> 02:34:48,523
Every car he had,
he was arrested 15 times before he was 

3395
02:34:51,251 --> 02:34:54,130
18,
like just a disaster.

3396
02:34:54,490 --> 02:34:57,850
And you look at him now.
He's got a great wife,

3397
02:34:57,851 --> 02:35:02,710
a beautiful kid.
He's a working comic and he's awesome.

3398
02:35:02,711 --> 02:35:05,770
He did.
He knows how to cohost my show.

3399
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:07,150
He,
he gets it.

3400
02:35:07,510 --> 02:35:08,343
He,
uh,

3401
02:35:08,470 --> 02:35:09,303
we don't step on each other.
He knows exactly what to throw in and 

3402
02:35:12,581 --> 02:35:15,550
when,
so a really happy with the,

3403
02:35:15,580 --> 02:35:16,660
with the tape.
Landau.

3404
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:20,020
He only did one show with them the last 
time I was in town with.

3405
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:21,280
Yeah,
he's great.

3406
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:23,160
He's a good guy,
man.

3407
02:35:23,230 --> 02:35:23,950
Dude.
Yes.

3408
02:35:23,950 --> 02:35:24,783
Smart and really decent.
Like it's so weird to see people that 

3409
02:35:28,331 --> 02:35:32,650
you didn't know when they were such fuck
ups and fucked up because like,

3410
02:35:33,070 --> 02:35:34,840
you know,
you almost want to go.

3411
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:35,491
All right,
come on,

3412
02:35:35,491 --> 02:35:38,410
we'll just drink one night.
I want to see what a disaster you are,

3413
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:39,670
you know,
uh,

3414
02:35:40,060 --> 02:35:40,600
because,
you know,

3415
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:43,790
you just don't know how fucked up people
can get a,

3416
02:35:44,050 --> 02:35:45,130
but you'd never know.
He's,

3417
02:35:45,160 --> 02:35:46,540
he's a,
he's a decent guy.

3418
02:35:47,730 --> 02:35:48,880
I like what you're doing,
man.

3419
02:35:48,881 --> 02:35:49,810
I love it.
I love that.

3420
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:52,730
Cool.
You're doing something different in you,

3421
02:35:52,790 --> 02:35:56,950
you basically,
you got put into a corner and said,

3422
02:35:56,951 --> 02:35:58,360
all right,
I'm going to figure my way out of this.

3423
02:35:58,420 --> 02:35:59,253
It was a lifeboat at first,
but it was really expanded it now and 

3424
02:36:01,580 --> 02:36:04,210
it's,
it's become a really interesting thing.

3425
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:05,323
Yeah.
And,

3426
02:36:05,430 --> 02:36:06,263
and I never expected it.
I gave it a lot of thought in between 

3427
02:36:11,651 --> 02:36:15,970
being fired and when we finally fired it
up a compound media,

3428
02:36:15,971 --> 02:36:17,860
I was like,
what do I do too?

3429
02:36:17,861 --> 02:36:18,694
Why do I go fucking buy a ranch 
somewhere in the middle of the sticks 

3430
02:36:23,111 --> 02:36:26,320
and get guns and write a manifesto or 
something or,

3431
02:36:26,350 --> 02:36:28,120
you know,
I didn't know what to do.

3432
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:29,333
Uh,
no one was knocking on my door to 

3433
02:36:30,491 --> 02:36:31,990
fucking get me a job.
So,

3434
02:36:32,450 --> 02:36:33,970
uh,
when,

3435
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:36,730
when the idea came to do this,
it was pretty much all right,

3436
02:36:36,731 --> 02:36:37,564
I want to do this.
And regardless of how many subs I guy 

3437
02:36:40,511 --> 02:36:41,344
get,
the overhead is going to be barely 

3438
02:36:42,641 --> 02:36:43,474
anything.
It's me and my basement doing a 

3439
02:36:45,130 --> 02:36:45,963
broadcast.
So,

3440
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:48,640
uh,
I wasn't really worried about the number

3441
02:36:48,641 --> 02:36:49,474
of subscribers or anything like that.
And when we launched and it was really 

3442
02:36:52,721 --> 02:36:54,460
successful,
uh,

3443
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:57,460
during the course of that year,
we started getting other shows,

3444
02:36:57,461 --> 02:36:58,500
legion of skanks,
uh,

3445
02:36:58,550 --> 02:37:01,270
the guys out there.
I'm big jay oakerson and uh,

3446
02:37:01,570 --> 02:37:03,240
steve smith and uh,
no,

3447
02:37:03,241 --> 02:37:04,300
no,
they have their own thing.

3448
02:37:04,301 --> 02:37:05,560
Louis j gomez.
Yeah.

3449
02:37:05,590 --> 02:37:06,810
They got their own thing,
um,

3450
02:37:07,130 --> 02:37:08,560
on,
on their own network.

3451
02:37:08,900 --> 02:37:09,733
Uh,
but for a while they were doing their 

3452
02:37:10,811 --> 02:37:14,200
show from my house,
which was so weird.

3453
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:15,033
It was like,
because you need their legion of skanks 

3454
02:37:17,751 --> 02:37:18,670
with them.
They have their,

3455
02:37:18,740 --> 02:37:20,480
part of their show is that live 
audience.

3456
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:21,673
So I'd have people coming into my 
backyard that I didn't know from a hole 

3457
02:37:24,201 --> 02:37:25,034
in the wall that had driven out to 
roslyn long island to sit on folding 

3458
02:37:28,611 --> 02:37:32,180
chairs in front of the guys.
And I'm walking around my basement,

3459
02:37:32,181 --> 02:37:33,320
like,
who are these?

3460
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:34,670
Like,
this is a little weird.

3461
02:37:34,671 --> 02:37:37,130
It's a little intrusive,
but it's cool.

3462
02:37:37,131 --> 02:37:37,964
But it.
And then it really started getting 

3463
02:37:39,051 --> 02:37:40,550
fucked up because during the summer 
months,

3464
02:37:40,890 --> 02:37:42,830
uh,
they all jumped in the pool.

3465
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:43,873
So now they're swimming in my pool.
Legion of skanks was in my pool and it 

3466
02:37:48,801 --> 02:37:51,140
was the weirdest,
it was cold and we'd all just,

3467
02:37:51,141 --> 02:37:52,580
you know,
have a few beers talk,

3468
02:37:52,581 --> 02:37:55,070
you get to know people.
So it wasn't that bad.

3469
02:37:55,071 --> 02:37:56,150
No one ever did anything bad.

3470
02:37:56,150 --> 02:37:58,340
They respected the house and everything,
which was very cool.

3471
02:37:58,660 --> 02:38:00,560
Um,
and then gavin was doing the show.

3472
02:38:00,561 --> 02:38:05,561
We got gavin on board from my house and 
a lot of times it was at night,

3473
02:38:05,631 --> 02:38:08,300
so I'd be upstairs on my couch watching 
tv or something.

3474
02:38:08,480 --> 02:38:09,313
He'd finish up,
come upstairs and sit on the couch and 

3475
02:38:10,761 --> 02:38:11,541
be like,
hey man,

3476
02:38:11,541 --> 02:38:12,410
what's that?
And I'm just like,

3477
02:38:12,860 --> 02:38:15,260
I just don't want to talk.
I talked all day,

3478
02:38:15,261 --> 02:38:16,610
I'm just,
I want to watch tv.

3479
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:20,570
So it became a little weird and after a 
year,

3480
02:38:21,020 --> 02:38:22,010
uh,
keith was like,

3481
02:38:22,011 --> 02:38:24,080
let's get a place in the city.
It's easier for guests.

3482
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:28,040
So we've got a place at a 35th and 
seventh right near penn station,

3483
02:38:28,570 --> 02:38:29,840
which works great.
You know,

3484
02:38:29,841 --> 02:38:32,870
I take the train and now I don't have to
fucking drive into the city a,

3485
02:38:32,980 --> 02:38:37,010
although that's another nightmare,
the transit long island railroad.

3486
02:38:37,430 --> 02:38:38,263
But,
uh,

3487
02:38:38,330 --> 02:38:39,890
it,
it just works out better that way.

3488
02:38:39,891 --> 02:38:43,920
It gets me out of the house.
It's a separation of personal life and,

3489
02:38:43,921 --> 02:38:44,700
and,
uh,

3490
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:45,610
the,
the job.

3491
02:38:45,611 --> 02:38:50,240
So it works out.
I liked my podcasts in my house too.

3492
02:38:50,570 --> 02:38:51,403
I think everybody does a little kids to 
hear him in the background screaming at 

3493
02:38:53,961 --> 02:38:54,860
each other.
Mommy,

3494
02:38:54,861 --> 02:38:55,940
she took my thing,
you know,

3495
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:58,730
because they were really little at the 
time because doing it for nine years,

3496
02:38:58,731 --> 02:39:00,260
the holy fuck.
Yeah.

3497
02:39:00,470 --> 02:39:02,270
Oh my god,
no time.

3498
02:39:02,560 --> 02:39:03,393
Yeah.
So I did it in my house and then we 

3499
02:39:04,971 --> 02:39:07,530
started doing some of them,
the ice house and then I got a,

3500
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:08,930
got a place,
got a,

3501
02:39:08,931 --> 02:39:09,950
uh,
the last one.

3502
02:39:10,020 --> 02:39:10,520
Yeah.
Yes.

3503
02:39:10,520 --> 02:39:13,250
You went to remember that.
And then as the show got bigger,

3504
02:39:13,251 --> 02:39:14,780
I just said,
let's get a big place.

3505
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:16,730
Let's.
This is insane joe.

3506
02:39:16,731 --> 02:39:17,564
I like,
I don't know how much you've shown the 

3507
02:39:19,221 --> 02:39:20,054
people on your show.

3508
02:39:20,090 --> 02:39:22,070
Do you venture out and show him 
anything?

3509
02:39:22,071 --> 02:39:24,350
Because it's,
it's insane.

3510
02:39:24,380 --> 02:39:25,213
It's a fucking airplane hangar.
This is giant and everything in every 

3511
02:39:30,891 --> 02:39:34,070
corner is cool.
Like it's all just cool.

3512
02:39:34,250 --> 02:39:39,250
There's for a,
you got weights and mats and then that,

3513
02:39:40,130 --> 02:39:43,670
that hunting thing,
that archery game.

3514
02:39:43,690 --> 02:39:44,900
A game.
No hunt.

3515
02:39:44,990 --> 02:39:46,280
It's amazing.
It's,

3516
02:39:46,281 --> 02:39:47,270
you know,
it is a game.

3517
02:39:47,271 --> 02:39:49,490
The scores like you compete against each
other.

3518
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:50,353
Yeah.
You're firing real arrows with your 

3519
02:39:51,711 --> 02:39:52,544
compound.
Bow into what does that kevlar kevlar 

3520
02:39:54,891 --> 02:39:55,670
screen.
The,

3521
02:39:55,670 --> 02:39:58,310
the tips are flat like the top of a 
water bottle.

3522
02:39:58,311 --> 02:40:00,080
So slaps it.
It doesn't penetrate.

3523
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:01,153
Yeah.
I went to a gun range a couple of times 

3524
02:40:04,131 --> 02:40:04,964
on long island that also used a video on
a screen that was made with a giant 

3525
02:40:10,851 --> 02:40:12,950
rolls of paper,
one horizontal,

3526
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:17,960
one vertical and a,
a sensor would read the light that would

3527
02:40:18,001 --> 02:40:18,834
come through when a bullet hit and uh,
that would record where you shot and 

3528
02:40:22,831 --> 02:40:23,760
accurately show that.

3529
02:40:23,910 --> 02:40:24,743
And then after too many holes got in,
all you have to do is wind the paper a 

3530
02:40:28,741 --> 02:40:32,220
little bit on each one and it,
it misaligns the holes.

3531
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:34,920
So now you got a whole new sheet of 
paper to shoot at.

3532
02:40:35,070 --> 02:40:35,960
Oh wow.
Uh,

3533
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:36,781
yeah.
And,

3534
02:40:36,781 --> 02:40:38,820
and it was,
it was very cold to be able to shoot it.

3535
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:40,480
Video targets of,
you know,

3536
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:41,800
the bad guy.
Well,

3537
02:40:41,801 --> 02:40:44,520
it sounds like really good for real life
situations for hunting.

3538
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:46,320
That thing's amazing.
Yeah.

3539
02:40:46,350 --> 02:40:46,861
You,
you,

3540
02:40:46,861 --> 02:40:50,910
you're not just looking at a bullseye,
like a typical target face.

3541
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:51,953
You're looking at the crease behind the 
shoulder where you're trying to hit the 

3542
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:55,200
heart.
By the way,

3543
02:40:55,201 --> 02:40:57,570
you nailed that one.
I like the second one.

3544
02:40:57,571 --> 02:40:58,980
You did.
It was a deer.

3545
02:40:58,981 --> 02:41:01,650
Just a video of a deer standing there 
and it's moving.

3546
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:02,513
It's not a still picture.
And you drew that back and hit it 

3547
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:07,920
exactly in the crease behind the leg.

3548
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:09,930
That was a hard shot.
Really cool.

3549
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:12,060
This fucking game is very addictive 
though.

3550
02:41:12,090 --> 02:41:14,920
You'll be out there pulling that boback 
you fuck your shoulder up,

3551
02:41:15,570 --> 02:41:20,550
pulling back 70 pounds all day long.
Gets super addictive.

3552
02:41:20,551 --> 02:41:23,010
Like think about how addictive it is to 
play video games.

3553
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:23,873
Oh yeah.
Think about competing against another 

3554
02:41:25,321 --> 02:41:27,450
bow hunter and you talking shit to each 
other.

3555
02:41:27,451 --> 02:41:30,000
Playing this game with deer walking out 
in the field.

3556
02:41:30,240 --> 02:41:32,520
It's really great practice for actual 
bowhunting.

3557
02:41:32,670 --> 02:41:33,503
Yeah.
You could tell it's very accurate to 

3558
02:41:34,711 --> 02:41:35,760
wherever that,
uh,

3559
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:39,130
wherever the bolt hit,
it's fucking right.

3560
02:41:39,131 --> 02:41:40,590
Right on the money.
Very,

3561
02:41:40,770 --> 02:41:42,830
very cool though.
This place is awesome.

3562
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:46,800
An amazing.
I can't even you,

3563
02:41:46,801 --> 02:41:47,670
you were,
you know,

3564
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:49,770
you took the ball and fucking ran with 
it,

3565
02:41:49,771 --> 02:41:51,390
man.
You really did.

3566
02:41:51,391 --> 02:41:54,420
This is amazing.
Just an amazing accomplishment.

3567
02:41:54,630 --> 02:41:56,910
Like you're not your,
the guy like,

3568
02:41:56,940 --> 02:41:57,780
like people are like,
oh,

3569
02:41:57,781 --> 02:41:58,890
you're gone on rogan's podcast.

3570
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:01,500
Oh shit.
He's the guy at you.

3571
02:42:01,510 --> 02:42:04,630
You're like ended up being the guy 
because of you guys.

3572
02:42:04,650 --> 02:42:06,150
That's great.
Awesome man.

3573
02:42:06,180 --> 02:42:10,020
Because of being a guest on o and a and 
then watch crazy compound.

3574
02:42:10,021 --> 02:42:12,420
That's absolutely where it all started.
Crazy.

3575
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:14,470
I just want it.
When I was doing that I,

3576
02:42:14,480 --> 02:42:16,170
I,
it was trial and error.

3577
02:42:16,171 --> 02:42:21,171
I would go to b and h photo in manhattan
and just buy shit and take it home,

3578
02:42:21,241 --> 02:42:22,370
hook it up and go,
ah,

3579
02:42:22,390 --> 02:42:25,320
that don't quite work.
Throw something in the closet,

3580
02:42:25,321 --> 02:42:26,154
get something else.
And slowly built up what I needed to 

3581
02:42:29,191 --> 02:42:30,024
have at work.
My goal was really to have lower thirds 

3582
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:33,863
and video over my shoulder and look into
the camera with a teleprompter so it 

3583
02:42:38,371 --> 02:42:39,204
looked like the news,
but it was done by a drunk guy who is 

3584
02:42:43,890 --> 02:42:47,250
good to go off and just sing karaoke.
Horrible language.

3585
02:42:47,430 --> 02:42:52,080
Like that to me was always funny,
like it was a parody of a real tv show.

3586
02:42:52,081 --> 02:42:52,914
I want it to look good.
Not just a grainy camera with xbox 

3587
02:42:56,191 --> 02:42:57,024
headset.
Just talking about this at the comedy 

3588
02:42:59,341 --> 02:43:00,174
store.
The other night we were watching the 

3589
02:43:00,631 --> 02:43:01,464
news,
it was on the television and we're 

3590
02:43:02,611 --> 02:43:03,444
saying how much better would the news 
being if you get a couple of us and get 

3591
02:43:06,211 --> 02:43:08,450
fucked up and start smoking weed and 
they just.

3592
02:43:08,910 --> 02:43:12,100
But the real news,
like actual real stores like oh

3593
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:14,260
shit,
look what the fuck that guy just did.

3594
02:43:14,600 --> 02:43:19,060
And then of the news is just with comics
like I've,

3595
02:43:19,061 --> 02:43:21,280
I've,
I've actually af after doing that at the

3596
02:43:21,281 --> 02:43:22,114
comedy store and watching them and 
talking to a couple of friends have 

3597
02:43:23,891 --> 02:43:24,724
actually thought about doing that.
Like having a nightly news show or a 

3598
02:43:28,331 --> 02:43:32,650
morning news show or just a show where 
one hour of the day is just like,

3599
02:43:32,651 --> 02:43:37,360
you get the ap feed,
the news feed and you've got video to go

3600
02:43:37,361 --> 02:43:42,010
with it and you do a stoned out or drunk
new show.

3601
02:43:42,040 --> 02:43:43,120
Yeah,
we,

3602
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:48,800
we have a guy michael malice that does 
kind of a daily wrap up show at 11:00

3603
02:43:49,650 --> 02:43:50,483
PM and it's hilarious because he'll put 
like the other day was talking about 

3604
02:43:54,361 --> 02:43:58,400
tucker carlson and the graphic comes up 
and it says a tucker calls it,

3605
02:43:58,410 --> 02:44:03,060
but it's a picture of um,
who the fuck was it a sean hannity?

3606
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:06,300
It was a picture of sean hannity and he 
does shit like that all the time.

3607
02:44:06,301 --> 02:44:07,410
And people like,
dude,

3608
02:44:07,411 --> 02:44:09,760
that's not tuck his wife.
No,

3609
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:12,540
I thought it was,
but he does that on purpose.

3610
02:44:12,541 --> 02:44:16,230
Like he fucks with the graphics and the 
ticker at the bottom and everything.

3611
02:44:16,231 --> 02:44:18,150
And it's really weird.
It's really funny.

3612
02:44:18,270 --> 02:44:19,960
He's a,
he's a smart guy too.

3613
02:44:19,980 --> 02:44:22,650
He's a clever,
a little shit.

3614
02:44:23,230 --> 02:44:24,180
Uh,
yeah.

3615
02:44:24,181 --> 02:44:26,080
So,
but that's shit like,

3616
02:44:26,081 --> 02:44:26,914
that is great.
We did it.

3617
02:44:26,970 --> 02:44:27,803
We did an election show during the 
presidential election a couple of years 

3618
02:44:31,590 --> 02:44:31,840
ago.

3619
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:32,673
Then gavin was on that one and we had 
all the big american flag waving in the 

3620
02:44:35,911 --> 02:44:37,560
background on the green screen and 
everything,

3621
02:44:37,561 --> 02:44:38,394
and,
and we were calling it like a sporting 

3622
02:44:39,541 --> 02:44:40,950
event.
Depalo was there,

3623
02:44:41,290 --> 02:44:42,123
uh,
and it really turned into like a 

3624
02:44:43,381 --> 02:44:45,150
football game.
You're just going,

3625
02:44:45,151 --> 02:44:46,500
oh my god,
we just got Florida.

3626
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:48,300
Oh my god.
It was so.

3627
02:44:48,301 --> 02:44:49,134
And it was.
We were all drinking and lab and it was 

3628
02:44:51,001 --> 02:44:53,100
an election coverage like the news would
do,

3629
02:44:53,101 --> 02:44:55,800
but we were just hammered and laughing 
our balls off.

3630
02:44:55,801 --> 02:44:57,830
Know what do you think happens to gavin 
now?

3631
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:01,210
A well,
no one bounces back from this.

3632
02:45:01,290 --> 02:45:03,360
That kind of shit.
It's so tough.

3633
02:45:03,390 --> 02:45:05,700
It's a different kind of shit that he's 
in right now.

3634
02:45:05,910 --> 02:45:08,790
Cult leader,
like he's in this,

3635
02:45:08,950 --> 02:45:13,180
they've,
they've got david koresh as mouse has.

3636
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:18,220
He's got the eye of sauron on him.
Just once that's on you.

3637
02:45:18,271 --> 02:45:20,790
It's very hard to shake that fucking 
thing off of you.

3638
02:45:21,220 --> 02:45:24,100
Yeah,
if anyone can do it.

3639
02:45:24,101 --> 02:45:24,934
It's gavin.
He's been really reborn a couple of 

3640
02:45:27,110 --> 02:45:31,240
times.
He was supposed to be trans thing.

3641
02:45:31,650 --> 02:45:33,360
Not really.
Ah,

3642
02:45:33,410 --> 02:45:36,700
they gave him a lot of shit for that and
he got plus this company.

3643
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:37,753
Yeah.
But that's like professional stuff 

3644
02:45:38,901 --> 02:45:42,520
that's not like show biz stuff now he's 
in this weird show.

3645
02:45:42,521 --> 02:45:43,730
Biz exile.
A

3646
02:45:44,160 --> 02:45:46,030
place.
Yeah.

3647
02:45:46,480 --> 02:45:48,840
Willie's on crtv.
Yeah.

3648
02:45:48,841 --> 02:45:50,730
That's still real.
He does a show there.

3649
02:45:50,731 --> 02:45:52,000
Yeah.
Fuck watches that.

3650
02:45:52,001 --> 02:45:53,070
I don't know.
You know,

3651
02:45:53,110 --> 02:45:53,760
I,
I,

3652
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:55,940
I see clips of him.
But um,

3653
02:45:56,520 --> 02:45:57,630
yeah,
it's raised that.

3654
02:45:57,660 --> 02:46:00,570
What is crtv?
It's another kind of an internet thing.

3655
02:46:01,310 --> 02:46:02,143
Yeah.
But more straight news kind of based a 

3656
02:46:04,770 --> 02:46:06,720
why would they have him on it?
Uh,

3657
02:46:07,060 --> 02:46:07,893
he was on there.
He got hired by them maybe a year or so 

3658
02:46:10,940 --> 02:46:10,940
ago,

3659
02:46:10,940 --> 02:46:12,410
but if they're trying to do something 
straight,

3660
02:46:12,411 --> 02:46:14,990
he's not like you at least kind of the 
goofy.

3661
02:46:15,190 --> 02:46:16,650
I think the goofy.
Yeah.

3662
02:46:16,850 --> 02:46:18,050
Aspect of it.
And then they'll have,

3663
02:46:18,051 --> 02:46:19,790
you know,
the regular straight laced guy.

3664
02:46:19,820 --> 02:46:21,230
Why don't you have them on compound 
anymore?

3665
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:24,380
Uh,
he got a better offer to go over there,

3666
02:46:24,381 --> 02:46:26,190
you know,
and I can hold anybody back here.

3667
02:46:26,220 --> 02:46:29,840
Why you don't chew.
It is weird though,

3668
02:46:29,841 --> 02:46:34,790
because you can be stricken from the 
record as they showed with Alex Jones.

3669
02:46:35,630 --> 02:46:38,420
They just,
holy fuck.

3670
02:46:38,421 --> 02:46:41,810
Did they just get rid of him?
He is a nonperson.

3671
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:45,840
They fucking took every aspect of his 
uh,

3672
02:46:45,841 --> 02:46:46,674
uh,
feed off of every bit of social media 

3673
02:46:49,011 --> 02:46:51,620
and it's obviously a coordinated effort.
Yeah.

3674
02:46:51,621 --> 02:46:52,454
Yeah.
This is not just one company that also 

3675
02:46:54,291 --> 02:46:55,124
competes with another company that all 
of a sudden they all just universally 

3676
02:46:57,441 --> 02:46:59,990
decided on their own independently.
Yeah.

3677
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,310
No,
they,

3678
02:47:00,310 --> 02:47:03,080
they coordinated that I can't stand the 
uh,

3679
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:06,080
you know,
I am an absolutist with free speech.

3680
02:47:06,081 --> 02:47:08,480
I and,
and I know the fucking line.

3681
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:11,150
It's a private company can do what they 
want.

3682
02:47:11,151 --> 02:47:13,760
Freedom of speech is about the 
government in this.

3683
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:14,931
It's like,
yeah,

3684
02:47:14,931 --> 02:47:15,764
but are you okay with that?
Are you okay with a faceless 

3685
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:20,900
corporation?
Uh,

3686
02:47:20,901 --> 02:47:21,734
deciding what you can watch and see and 
hear and who can speak based on nothing 

3687
02:47:25,761 --> 02:47:29,180
but this arbitrary ideology that comes 
out of a building.

3688
02:47:29,390 --> 02:47:30,710
Like,
I don't like that.

3689
02:47:30,711 --> 02:47:35,690
I want anyone to have the ability to 
speak about anything they want,

3690
02:47:35,691 --> 02:47:40,220
no matter how repugnant it is.
Like like meet it with a lively debate.

3691
02:47:40,340 --> 02:47:40,940
Well,
here's the.

3692
02:47:40,940 --> 02:47:44,900
Here's a perfect example.
Forget Alex Jones was talking about what

3693
02:47:44,901 --> 02:47:47,600
we talked about earlier.
Laura loomer versus louis farrakhan.

3694
02:47:47,970 --> 02:47:48,803
You where's your consistency?
You've got to explain to me how that 

3695
02:47:50,391 --> 02:47:50,840
works.

3696
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:51,673
How does that was,
is it okay for the guy on twitter to be 

3697
02:47:53,451 --> 02:47:55,400
calling jewish people?
Termites?

3698
02:47:56,120 --> 02:47:57,620
I mean that.
That is.

3699
02:47:57,710 --> 02:47:59,530
That's something you exterminate.
Yeah.

3700
02:47:59,531 --> 02:48:01,130
Yes.
It's nazi Germany type.

3701
02:48:01,180 --> 02:48:02,300
Yeah,
exactly.

3702
02:48:02,450 --> 02:48:03,350
How is that?
Okay.

3703
02:48:03,530 --> 02:48:05,360
That's okay with you,
but then,

3704
02:48:06,090 --> 02:48:07,410
I mean,
how about look,

3705
02:48:07,450 --> 02:48:08,283
it works that way on the left as well.
Like how about that guy that just got 

3706
02:48:10,521 --> 02:48:14,590
kicked off of cnn as he was talking 
about the jewish people,

3707
02:48:14,610 --> 02:48:15,443
Israel,
palestine and that he's for palestinian 

3708
02:48:17,421 --> 02:48:19,160
liberation and they were like,
fuck you,

3709
02:48:19,161 --> 02:48:19,994
you're done like this.
This decision that or the thought 

3710
02:48:24,321 --> 02:48:25,154
processes involved in decisions that 
they make is not based on rational 

3711
02:48:27,831 --> 02:48:30,710
thinking and objective reasoning.
It's so arbitrary.

3712
02:48:31,250 --> 02:48:32,083
You just don't know.
It's based on which way the culture 

3713
02:48:34,150 --> 02:48:39,150
swinging and the culture is swinging in 
a way that avoids any,

3714
02:48:40,370 --> 02:48:44,390
any possible accusations of racism.
If you think in any way,

3715
02:48:44,391 --> 02:48:46,280
shape or form,
you're going to be thought of as racist.

3716
02:48:46,430 --> 02:48:47,263
You avoid that because there's some 
people that say horrific shit about 

3717
02:48:50,091 --> 02:48:51,250
white people.
Oh yeah.

3718
02:48:51,251 --> 02:48:53,540
Yeah.
They don't get van literally calling for

3719
02:48:53,541 --> 02:48:56,270
their death and,
and yeah,

3720
02:48:56,300 --> 02:48:57,030
they don't.
The,

3721
02:48:57,030 --> 02:48:57,863
that got hired by New York times and it 
was a massive uproar because she had so 

3722
02:49:00,861 --> 02:49:03,440
many anti white things on her twitter.
Oh yeah,

3723
02:49:03,450 --> 02:49:04,251
yeah.
The uh,

3724
02:49:04,251 --> 02:49:05,450
the asian girl.
Yeah,

3725
02:49:05,510 --> 02:49:06,170
yeah,
yeah.

3726
02:49:06,170 --> 02:49:08,730
I mean,
just all that ridiculous

3727
02:49:08,730 --> 02:49:09,563
leftwing woke nonsense.
You're allowed to be completely racist 

3728
02:49:14,341 --> 02:49:15,174
against white people.
Massive generalizations against white 

3729
02:49:17,131 --> 02:49:18,530
men in particular.
Like,

3730
02:49:18,730 --> 02:49:19,200
yeah,
yeah,

3731
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:21,540
it is.
It absolutely is discrimination.

3732
02:49:21,541 --> 02:49:25,500
And it's absolutely what you're doing is
you're being prejudiced,

3733
02:49:25,530 --> 02:49:28,740
but you're being prejudice with a stamp.
You've got a stamp of approval.

3734
02:49:28,780 --> 02:49:29,400
Yeah.

3735
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:30,840
Yeah.
You're allowed to be.

3736
02:49:30,841 --> 02:49:31,674
And I love the,
the rules that are made up that are 

3737
02:49:33,451 --> 02:49:34,380
ridiculous.
It's like,

3738
02:49:34,700 --> 02:49:36,240
oh,
you're a racist.

3739
02:49:36,241 --> 02:49:39,680
I can't be a racist.
I'm this or that or that.

3740
02:49:39,690 --> 02:49:41,280
I can't be sexist.
I can't be this.

3741
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:43,500
Like who's making these fucking rules 
up?

3742
02:49:43,530 --> 02:49:46,410
Exactly.
How come I am not privy to any of them?

3743
02:49:46,411 --> 02:49:48,770
Of course I can.
I can call on any of these.

3744
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:50,013
Did.
The beautiful thing about that is that 

3745
02:49:50,931 --> 02:49:54,260
hypocrisy will eventually bite them in 
their ass and people who are rational,

3746
02:49:54,261 --> 02:49:58,070
who listened to the argument against it,
and so will you absolutely can be sexist

3747
02:49:58,071 --> 02:49:58,960
against men.
Yeah,

3748
02:49:58,990 --> 02:49:59,860
absolutely.
Ken,

3749
02:49:59,861 --> 02:50:00,694
of course,
and you are a lot of feminists are 100 

3750
02:50:02,961 --> 02:50:03,794
percent sexist against men.
There's this feminist that I follow her 

3751
02:50:06,141 --> 02:50:08,750
fucking twitter picture,
the image,

3752
02:50:08,751 --> 02:50:10,580
the big one.
The banner one says,

3753
02:50:10,581 --> 02:50:11,960
trust.
No man.

3754
02:50:13,060 --> 02:50:14,090
Okay,
well good.

3755
02:50:14,091 --> 02:50:14,924
Fucking luck.
Good luck cutting out half the 

3756
02:50:16,611 --> 02:50:18,080
population.
Don't trust them.

3757
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:19,970
How about trust?
All women?

3758
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:20,850
You're going to do that.
Well,

3759
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:22,310
great.
Congratulations.

3760
02:50:22,311 --> 02:50:26,820
Because you got about 15 to 20 percent 
and that's.

3761
02:50:26,860 --> 02:50:28,220
You're going to have to trust all of 
them.

3762
02:50:28,770 --> 02:50:29,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

3763
02:50:29,570 --> 02:50:30,590
Good luck.
You got 80,

3764
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:32,000
80,
85,

3765
02:50:32,030 --> 02:50:35,840
90 percent maybe.
Good gals got polluted.

3766
02:50:36,650 --> 02:50:38,840
Polluted population.
Just like men.

3767
02:50:39,450 --> 02:50:41,810
Population of men is a polluted 
population of women.

3768
02:50:41,990 --> 02:50:42,823
If you,
if you thought that you were going to 

3769
02:50:43,401 --> 02:50:45,380
get pure drinking water without dropping
in those,

3770
02:50:45,381 --> 02:50:47,180
uh,
purification tablets,

3771
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:49,670
you're going to get some shit in there.
Yeah,

3772
02:50:49,671 --> 02:50:51,170
you're going to get,
you're going to get sick.

3773
02:50:51,620 --> 02:50:52,221
The,
yeah,

3774
02:50:52,221 --> 02:50:53,730
that there's no,

3775
02:50:54,780 --> 02:50:55,613
there's no 100 percent on any of that.
So when we saw the whole believe all 

3776
02:50:59,521 --> 02:51:02,540
women thing that happened during the 
cabinet hearings,

3777
02:51:02,860 --> 02:51:06,620
I didn't do that bit the other night.
I did a now tell it to you off air.

3778
02:51:07,190 --> 02:51:08,370
I'll tell you something off here.
That's

3779
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:10,870
it.
It's,

3780
02:51:10,890 --> 02:51:12,070
it's,
it's crazy.

3781
02:51:12,100 --> 02:51:16,540
Like the idea that anyone would say,
believe all women is as mentally saying,

3782
02:51:16,541 --> 02:51:17,820
believed no women.
Exactly.

3783
02:51:17,830 --> 02:51:21,730
It's the same stupid thing because 
there's going to be assholes is going to

3784
02:51:21,731 --> 02:51:23,480
be pieces of shit.
Um,

3785
02:51:23,750 --> 02:51:28,750
I was saying on the show the other day,
like no one really wants equality.

3786
02:51:30,250 --> 02:51:32,140
No one.
Equality isn't good.

3787
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:33,393
The,
the fight for equality is where it's at 

3788
02:51:35,800 --> 02:51:39,250
and you never want to attain it because 
then you're not special anymore.

3789
02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:42,100
If you're fighting for equality that 
you're always a victim.

3790
02:51:42,101 --> 02:51:42,934
There's always a,
an oppressor and you're fighting that 

3791
02:51:45,070 --> 02:51:48,100
once you're equal,
you can be called a shithead.

3792
02:51:48,101 --> 02:51:51,100
You could be called stupid everything 
else.

3793
02:51:51,101 --> 02:51:51,934
You're just another face in the crowd 
with another stupid voice that probably 

3794
02:51:54,221 --> 02:51:55,390
shouldn't be heard.
Uh,

3795
02:51:55,600 --> 02:52:00,260
so no one ever really wants equality.
No matter how much they're clamoring was

3796
02:52:00,430 --> 02:52:01,263
get achieved.
You're going to find some reason why 

3797
02:52:02,531 --> 02:52:04,150
it's not right.
Why it's not valid.

3798
02:52:04,151 --> 02:52:06,190
And you can still say that you're

3799
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:08,980
being victimized by something that 
currency in it.

3800
02:52:09,280 --> 02:52:09,701
Yeah.
Yeah.

3801
02:52:09,701 --> 02:52:10,421
There is.
There's,

3802
02:52:10,421 --> 02:52:14,890
there's definitely equity and being a 
victim and not being equal yet,

3803
02:52:15,590 --> 02:52:18,200
but you're fighting.
You can say things that other people can

3804
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:19,990
say.
We see it all ties.

3805
02:52:19,991 --> 02:52:23,080
You can be completely prejudice.
You can do a lot of things.

3806
02:52:23,081 --> 02:52:24,940
You could never do if you were another 
race.

3807
02:52:24,970 --> 02:52:26,410
Yeah.
And now you see this,

3808
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:28,900
uh,
that avi naughty guy,

3809
02:52:28,901 --> 02:52:29,734
that lawyer just hilarious.
He had the whole believe all women and 

3810
02:52:33,941 --> 02:52:34,774
then like a fucking movie script spins 
around and bites him right in the ass 

3811
02:52:39,761 --> 02:52:41,350
where he's like,
I didn't do that.

3812
02:52:41,351 --> 02:52:42,184
She's lying.
It's like the fact that it happened so 

3813
02:52:45,701 --> 02:52:46,534
fast.
Like if that would have been hilarious 

3814
02:52:48,490 --> 02:52:49,323
if it happened two years from now,
but the fact that it happened right 

3815
02:52:52,091 --> 02:52:57,091
after that is just beyond hilarious.
Like the asia argento chick,

3816
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:58,300
right?

3817
02:52:58,300 --> 02:52:59,140
Yeah.
The other one,

3818
02:52:59,170 --> 02:53:02,320
the one who was accusing harvey 
weinstein of raping her.

3819
02:53:02,460 --> 02:53:06,380
Right.
And then turned out that she had been.

3820
02:53:06,390 --> 02:53:08,520
It's basically what,
what do they call it?

3821
02:53:08,540 --> 02:53:11,230
Statutory rape when you have sex with 17
year old boy,

3822
02:53:11,231 --> 02:53:12,064
which.
Yeah,

3823
02:53:12,700 --> 02:53:15,280
I don't think it is.
I don't think you think it is either,

3824
02:53:15,281 --> 02:53:18,490
but the law's the law and the fact that 
it came out,

3825
02:53:18,820 --> 02:53:23,050
it came out that bordain had paid this 
kid off there the whole time.

3826
02:53:23,051 --> 02:53:26,320
They're all just believe all women and 
like who don't believe that one.

3827
02:53:26,400 --> 02:53:27,000
Yeah.
Yeah,

3828
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:28,900
yeah.
That one we probably shouldn't believe.

3829
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:31,240
I mean this is,
this is a problem.

3830
02:53:31,241 --> 02:53:34,690
You got a real fucking problem.
And the fact that all that went down,

3831
02:53:34,930 --> 02:53:35,763
you know,
I mean it's just when these things play 

3832
02:53:38,021 --> 02:53:39,920
out like this,
it almost makes you wonder like,

3833
02:53:40,420 --> 02:53:41,260
god,
I don't,

3834
02:53:41,261 --> 02:53:44,110
I don't really believe we're living in a
simulation.

3835
02:53:44,620 --> 02:53:49,510
But if we were living in something 
that's designed to almost,

3836
02:53:50,860 --> 02:53:55,860
it instills this lack of appreciation 
for reality,

3837
02:53:57,980 --> 02:53:58,813
it seems.
It all seems so bizarre and ludicrous 

3838
02:54:01,540 --> 02:54:02,373
and it keeps people keep like when,
when the anthony wiener got in trouble 

3839
02:54:04,691 --> 02:54:07,690
for pulling his dick out,
I swear to god there was part of me that

3840
02:54:07,691 --> 02:54:09,570
was going.
This doesn't even make sense.

3841
02:54:09,800 --> 02:54:12,610
Like this is so,
so obvious.

3842
02:54:12,611 --> 02:54:15,010
It's so like right there.
Yeah.

3843
02:54:15,011 --> 02:54:16,600
Yeah.
So on the button.

3844
02:54:17,160 --> 02:54:18,910
Yeah.
Not even subtle enough.

3845
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:19,773
A lot of that stuff.
It seems like everything works out too 

3846
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:25,720
much.
Like it's scripted.

3847
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:28,540
Like during,
during trump's campaign,

3848
02:54:28,630 --> 02:54:31,450
I kept saying he's got a.
When I go,

3849
02:54:31,451 --> 02:54:33,490
this doesn't play.
If he doesn't win,

3850
02:54:33,580 --> 02:54:35,890
this isn't rocky one.
This has to be rocky too.

3851
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:36,993
He's got a fucking win.
It's not about the battle and the 

3852
02:54:38,921 --> 02:54:41,980
bravery and that he's got to win this 
for this to work.

3853
02:54:42,100 --> 02:54:44,980
To really highlight the theater of the 
absurd.

3854
02:54:45,010 --> 02:54:46,420
Right?
He's got to win.

3855
02:54:46,490 --> 02:54:47,323
Yes.
This is all fucking one spotlights in 

3856
02:54:48,911 --> 02:54:51,670
the air.
I see the theater of the absurd.

3857
02:54:51,730 --> 02:54:52,563
I mean that guy being president with his
fake hair sprayed down and orange skin 

3858
02:54:57,251 --> 02:55:00,190
with the wider on the eyes.
It all seems so fake.

3859
02:55:00,191 --> 02:55:03,380
Everything he says,
he says the way he looks like.

3860
02:55:03,381 --> 02:55:04,760
Yeah,
everything is insane.

3861
02:55:05,060 --> 02:55:05,893
I still,
every time I see him walking down the 

3862
02:55:07,971 --> 02:55:09,650
stairs at air force one,
I'm just like,

3863
02:55:09,980 --> 02:55:13,010
holy fuck.
Donald trump is the president.

3864
02:55:13,340 --> 02:55:18,340
Like what?
What kind of wacky world of really wacky

3865
02:55:18,651 --> 02:55:20,320
world,
ideally wacky.

3866
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:21,553
The other day when he was given that 
speech about elvis and it's just like 

3867
02:55:25,610 --> 02:55:27,470
people telling me,
I looked like elvis.

3868
02:55:27,980 --> 02:55:30,200
That's what people have told me.
If I wasn't blonde,

3869
02:55:30,380 --> 02:55:32,980
I looked like elvis and and it's like 
no,

3870
02:55:33,050 --> 02:55:36,500
no one told you that a little bit like 
elvis.

3871
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:37,393
No one ever told you that.
Maybe your belly right when elvis was 

3872
02:55:41,241 --> 02:55:44,270
sitting on the ball for the last time,
but that's about it.

3873
02:55:44,480 --> 02:55:48,500
How about when that reporter confronted 
him with the two of them together?

3874
02:55:51,060 --> 02:55:53,150
Well,
when I look at that picture,

3875
02:55:53,180 --> 02:55:55,070
if he was to me,
a leg leg,

3876
02:55:55,071 --> 02:55:57,700
the king maybe.
Oh my god.

3877
02:55:57,900 --> 02:56:01,490
A little bit about the upper right hand 
corner one.

3878
02:56:01,491 --> 02:56:06,491
Have you.
Have you ever seen anyone do that?

3879
02:56:09,200 --> 02:56:11,510
Fat was my favorite.
Fat elvis.

3880
02:56:13,150 --> 02:56:16,040
Too much baby.
Of course.

3881
02:56:16,041 --> 02:56:16,874
A thousand times now.
Have you ever seen someone so committed 

3882
02:56:20,871 --> 02:56:23,810
to a comb over for so many years?
Like so committed.

3883
02:56:23,940 --> 02:56:26,210
It's not just a coma.
I don't know what it is.

3884
02:56:26,760 --> 02:56:27,593
It's a contraption walking up the stairs
of air force one where the wind's 

3885
02:56:31,401 --> 02:56:32,234
blowing wind behind.
You see the whole back of his head is 

3886
02:56:33,981 --> 02:56:36,350
bald.
Like where's the hair coming from?

3887
02:56:36,380 --> 02:56:37,213
It was like a fucking vader's head 
without the helmet is kind of looked 

3888
02:56:39,981 --> 02:56:41,990
like that weird.
Like what's going on?

3889
02:56:42,230 --> 02:56:45,210
You never know where it's starting and 
where it ends at,

3890
02:56:45,320 --> 02:56:46,790
how long it is.

3891
02:56:46,790 --> 02:56:48,020
It's like,
look at that.

3892
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:50,260
Oh my god.
That's just a picture.

3893
02:56:50,390 --> 02:56:53,320
The video is more disturbing because you
see the flops.

3894
02:56:53,650 --> 02:56:54,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

3895
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:55,760
Chaos.
Well,

3896
02:56:55,761 --> 02:56:56,660
how about,
you know,

3897
02:56:57,050 --> 02:56:57,883
he didn't want to go out there for the 
4th of July memorial because he didn't 

3898
02:57:01,251 --> 02:57:03,220
want to get his hair with his hair wet 
in the rain.

3899
02:57:03,250 --> 02:57:04,250
That was a.
Yeah,

3900
02:57:04,251 --> 02:57:05,084
that's what they were saying.
I don't know that it's such a weird 

3901
02:57:08,871 --> 02:57:11,780
thing.
Like he was September 11th.

3902
02:57:11,781 --> 02:57:12,614
That's what it was.
The president of nine slash 11 was a 

3903
02:57:14,451 --> 02:57:19,451
veteran's memorial or veteran's day.
Isn't it odd that the president is a guy

3904
02:57:21,771 --> 02:57:26,510
that's so like insecure than ever for 
decades.

3905
02:57:26,511 --> 02:57:31,040
He has to fucking do a,
a fucking dairy queen ice cream.

3906
02:57:31,041 --> 02:57:34,010
Fucking move on his head every day.
So he's fat.

3907
02:57:34,130 --> 02:57:34,963
Like if your.
The thing is like if you really 

3908
02:57:36,261 --> 02:57:41,000
concerned so much about your looks or 
why are you fat while you're at it?

3909
02:57:41,450 --> 02:57:44,270
I don't think he thinks he's fat.
I think it's like one of those guys that

3910
02:57:44,271 --> 02:57:48,590
you talked about having a body 
dysmorphia body dysmorphia.

3911
02:57:48,591 --> 02:57:50,870
They just,
he looks in the mirror and sees elvis,

3912
02:57:50,871 --> 02:57:53,960
like young leather clad elvis.
Yeah.

3913
02:57:53,961 --> 02:57:55,330
He's got this weird thing.
You know,

3914
02:57:55,400 --> 02:57:58,640
where he doesn't believe in exercise 
because he feels like the body is like a

3915
02:57:58,641 --> 02:58:01,700
battery and if you put any energy and

3916
02:58:02,330 --> 02:58:03,900
where is it out?
Well,

3917
02:58:03,901 --> 02:58:06,070
the motherfucker is up at all hours.
The,

3918
02:58:06,290 --> 02:58:09,600
uh,
during the campaign for the midterms,

3919
02:58:09,780 --> 02:58:14,430
he was doing three rallies a day flying 
all over the country and he never seemed

3920
02:58:14,431 --> 02:58:17,490
to be like he was falling asleep or 
losing energy.

3921
02:58:17,491 --> 02:58:19,470
So I don't know what he's doing.
Well,

3922
02:58:19,570 --> 02:58:21,960
you know about all that he says I get 
exercise.

3923
02:58:21,961 --> 02:58:22,890
I mean,
I walk,

3924
02:58:23,400 --> 02:58:25,500
I this,
I that trump's nobody wants that.

3925
02:58:25,501 --> 02:58:28,380
During the oval office.
I run over to a building next door.

3926
02:58:28,440 --> 02:58:33,440
I get more exercise than people think.
I run over to a field basing my exercise

3927
02:58:35,471 --> 02:58:38,160
is incredible.
He's on allegedly,

3928
02:58:38,190 --> 02:58:41,040
according to one reporter,
he's on diet pills and that he's been on

3929
02:58:41,041 --> 02:58:44,070
diet pills forever.
And then there's a prescription that,

3930
02:58:44,350 --> 02:58:45,040
I mean,
he,

3931
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:45,873
he actually even cited the exact dwayne 
reed pharmacy where he was supposed to 

3932
02:58:49,891 --> 02:58:52,320
take this for a little while and he 
wound up taking it for years.

3933
02:58:52,540 --> 02:58:57,060
I was taking some form of amphetamines,
which in this day and age,

3934
02:58:57,790 --> 02:59:02,730
if you would be fucking stunned if you 
found out how many journalists,

3935
02:59:02,910 --> 02:59:05,970
how many people who are writers,
how many people that are professionals,

3936
02:59:06,090 --> 02:59:09,780
how many people that work were on 
adderall that I'm in.

3937
02:59:09,810 --> 02:59:11,700
I mean,
I live in an area where there's a lot of

3938
02:59:11,701 --> 02:59:12,534
people that have money and they work 
real hard and because of the fact that 

3939
02:59:15,271 --> 02:59:16,104
they need energy,
I know a shitload of people that are 

3940
02:59:18,601 --> 02:59:19,700
taken adderall.
Yeah.

3941
02:59:19,800 --> 02:59:23,400
Folks that are in hollywood,
folks that are in finance,

3942
02:59:23,401 --> 02:59:24,520
all sorts of different.
Yeah,

3943
02:59:24,740 --> 02:59:26,450
I know quite a few also.
Yeah,

3944
02:59:26,451 --> 02:59:27,330
they,
it's everywhere,

3945
02:59:27,331 --> 02:59:29,130
man.
And it is such a,

3946
02:59:30,060 --> 02:59:30,893
you know,
the difference between methamphetamines 

3947
02:59:33,090 --> 02:59:33,923
and amphetamines.
The difference between math and what 

3948
02:59:36,091 --> 02:59:40,350
you're getting when you get adderall is 
so god damn close.

3949
02:59:41,150 --> 02:59:42,650
So close.
But math,

3950
02:59:42,660 --> 02:59:45,030
it's crazy that you take that you're 
fucking,

3951
02:59:45,060 --> 02:59:45,810
you're a meth head.

3952
02:59:45,810 --> 02:59:48,060
The only difference is how quick it hits
you.

3953
02:59:48,260 --> 02:59:49,093
It's literally the only difference.
And then the dosage that you get is 

3954
02:59:51,661 --> 02:59:54,360
obviously regulated if you get adderall.
Right,

3955
02:59:54,361 --> 02:59:55,470
right.
I don't know.

3956
02:59:55,471 --> 02:59:56,101
I,
uh,

3957
02:59:56,101 --> 02:59:57,670
I'm not,
I'm not a pill guy.

3958
02:59:57,671 --> 02:59:59,180
I never have been.
What do you got here,

3959
02:59:59,200 --> 03:00:00,033
jamie?
We pull it up.

3960
03:00:00,210 --> 03:00:03,010
It says here about being on a treadmill.
Awesome.

3961
03:00:03,710 --> 03:00:04,543
I was on a treadmill for the first time 
actually in quite a while and it was a 

3962
03:00:07,410 --> 03:00:09,780
very steep angle and I was there for a 
very long time.

3963
03:00:09,810 --> 03:00:12,150
He said they were surprised and they 
said,

3964
03:00:12,151 --> 03:00:13,140
well,
you could stop now.

3965
03:00:13,141 --> 03:00:14,820
That's amazing.
I said,

3966
03:00:14,821 --> 03:00:17,970
I can go much longer than this if you 
want me to hate trump.

3967
03:00:18,060 --> 03:00:20,220
I got to fucking right now,
buddy.

3968
03:00:20,610 --> 03:00:21,443
I got a challenge.
How about you joined the sober october 

3969
03:00:23,281 --> 03:00:25,090
fitness challenge next year,
man,

3970
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:26,610
hop on.
We'll put that strap on.

3971
03:00:26,611 --> 03:00:28,350
You will see what's up.
See what I'm saying?

3972
03:00:28,670 --> 03:00:32,850
Who's amazed?
A lot of mickey mantle gene.

3973
03:00:32,970 --> 03:00:33,803
Everything is over the top with trump.
Trump d dieted successfully before had 

3974
03:00:39,361 --> 03:00:41,910
been more of a believer in diet because 
I'm strong,

3975
03:00:41,911 --> 03:00:42,744
you know,
I've always been more of a believer in 

3976
03:00:44,371 --> 03:00:46,860
diet cause I'm strong.
You know,

3977
03:00:47,270 --> 03:00:51,060
I hit the ball far.
I mean I'm strong physically.

3978
03:00:51,061 --> 03:00:52,770
He said,
that is so hilarious.

3979
03:00:53,130 --> 03:00:54,880
Will you imagined wrestling him how?
Wiki?

3980
03:00:55,010 --> 03:00:57,600
Westfield.
Just a bag of jello.

3981
03:00:57,930 --> 03:00:59,530
Just wrap up body and

3982
03:01:00,250 --> 03:01:01,083
it's all gushy.
The bones are barely held together by a 

3983
03:01:04,511 --> 03:01:07,210
thread and I can.
What are you talking about?

3984
03:01:07,230 --> 03:01:08,063
Your ball far strung.
I mean when he said that he would beat 

3985
03:01:12,281 --> 03:01:13,720
up joe barden.
That was my.

3986
03:01:14,200 --> 03:01:17,260
That was like a peak ludicrousness yeah.
Yeah.

3987
03:01:17,300 --> 03:01:18,133
Was like,
what you're going to beat up to joe 

3988
03:01:19,511 --> 03:01:22,270
biden would go down fast and hard.
That's what he said.

3989
03:01:22,271 --> 03:01:23,104
Do it.
The fact that they're talking like that 

3990
03:01:25,190 --> 03:01:26,560
again.
Absurd.

3991
03:01:26,950 --> 03:01:31,090
It's so fucking funny that bull and 
biden has said the same thing.

3992
03:01:31,091 --> 03:01:33,280
Like he kick his ass.
He's a blake.

3993
03:01:33,430 --> 03:01:37,030
When did the truman and dewey trade 
barbs like that?

3994
03:01:37,031 --> 03:01:38,800
Back in the day is.
What is he saying?

3995
03:01:38,830 --> 03:01:41,500
Nixon and kennedy.
I did make a mistake,

3996
03:01:41,510 --> 03:01:44,950
but they asked me what I like to debate 
this gentleman.

3997
03:01:45,550 --> 03:01:46,091
I said,
no.

3998
03:01:46,091 --> 03:01:47,110
I said,
if we're in high school,

3999
03:01:47,111 --> 03:01:52,111
I've taken behind the gym and beat the 
hell out of them mean well,

4000
03:01:53,320 --> 03:01:54,010
I don't believe that.

4001
03:01:54,010 --> 03:01:56,560
I think trump would kick his ass.
I really do.

4002
03:01:57,160 --> 03:01:59,560
Trump is meaner and I think biden would 
make a mistake,

4003
03:01:59,780 --> 03:02:00,613
yet trump better be able to.
He would swing any would slip and he 

4004
03:02:03,671 --> 03:02:04,504
would fall and he'd fuck is nea and 
trump would kick him in the face like a 

4005
03:02:06,911 --> 03:02:08,740
soccer ball.
He would get lucky,

4006
03:02:08,780 --> 03:02:09,613
he would walk away and biden would be 
holding this teeth and blood coming out 

4007
03:02:12,131 --> 03:02:14,200
of his mouth and he'd be like,
I told you in the best,

4008
03:02:14,230 --> 03:02:16,210
the best ever.
And he'd get away with it.

4009
03:02:16,660 --> 03:02:20,470
It gets away with a lot of things and 
there'll be a lot of people want to kick

4010
03:02:20,471 --> 03:02:23,200
trump's ass and get back at them,
but it would never manifested,

4011
03:02:23,220 --> 03:02:25,960
so would never come to play.
Just like what's going on now.

4012
03:02:26,100 --> 03:02:28,780
It's like where people thought stormy 
daniels going to take them down.

4013
03:02:28,950 --> 03:02:32,050
And then it turns out stormy daniels 
beat some checkup on a porn set.

4014
03:02:32,050 --> 03:02:34,660
And,
and now she's after menotti also because

4015
03:02:34,661 --> 03:02:35,320
he,
uh,

4016
03:02:35,320 --> 03:02:36,153
apparently isn't giving her an 
accounting of where all the money that 

4017
03:02:38,860 --> 03:02:43,860
she raised a online was going to.
And he apparently filed.

4018
03:02:44,111 --> 03:02:48,490
She said he filed that lawsuit against 
trump against her wishes.

4019
03:02:48,700 --> 03:02:49,533
She didn't want it done and now she,
she's not getting an accounting of the 

4020
03:02:52,181 --> 03:02:53,290
money.
It's hilarious.

4021
03:02:53,650 --> 03:02:57,190
Defamation that she lost and now she has
to pay his legal,

4022
03:02:57,191 --> 03:03:00,110
his legal fees.
So this novel,

4023
03:03:00,130 --> 03:03:03,190
naughty guy's hilarious.
He wants to run for president.

4024
03:03:03,191 --> 03:03:06,550
Just another dummy in the mix.
Another dummy.

4025
03:03:06,700 --> 03:03:07,533
Listen to these.
He's another guy chain himself to a 

4026
03:03:08,921 --> 03:03:10,090
building.
It's the same thing.

4027
03:03:10,091 --> 03:03:11,820
It's the same bull horn,
right?

4028
03:03:11,830 --> 03:03:12,663
He just wants attention.
I had actually talked to guys in 

4029
03:03:15,431 --> 03:03:16,810
hollywood.
It works in hollywood.

4030
03:03:16,811 --> 03:03:17,644
He's like a high level guy.
He's got a respectable job and he's 

4031
03:03:19,841 --> 03:03:21,220
like,
we need a guideline like that.

4032
03:03:21,220 --> 03:03:23,320
Have an audi guy on our side.
It doesn't talk any shit.

4033
03:03:23,400 --> 03:03:24,233
Why doesn't take any shit?
A guy who could call trump out on his 

4034
03:03:26,501 --> 03:03:29,470
bullshit and I'm like,
what are you talking about man?

4035
03:03:29,580 --> 03:03:31,810
Like what are you talking about?
This guy,

4036
03:03:31,811 --> 03:03:32,644
this lawyer,
this guy's the guy you think you need 

4037
03:03:34,511 --> 03:03:36,370
running the country.
Are you serious?

4038
03:03:36,760 --> 03:03:37,593
It's a disaster.
They wanted to believe that he was the 

4039
03:03:39,521 --> 03:03:40,240
guy,
right?

4040
03:03:40,240 --> 03:03:42,310
It fit the narrative like,
yes,

4041
03:03:42,311 --> 03:03:44,980
we need a guy like that.
We need a good guy like trump.

4042
03:03:45,160 --> 03:03:48,460
You know keith olbermann is.
This is what all these people are a good

4043
03:03:48,461 --> 03:03:50,350
guy.
Who's gonna kill him.

4044
03:03:50,351 --> 03:03:52,660
You fat.
Fuck you fucking liar.

4045
03:03:52,780 --> 03:03:57,780
You pizza shit with trump.
Trump has nothing to lose is what it is.

4046
03:03:58,400 --> 03:03:59,233
Like trump could say anything and he 
does because where they're going to do 

4047
03:04:02,780 --> 03:04:03,440
well,
they're going to do.

4048
03:04:03,440 --> 03:04:05,730
He's one of the things about diet pills.
They're,

4049
03:04:05,750 --> 03:04:09,050
they're putting about amphetamines and 
they were reading down in this article,

4050
03:04:09,110 --> 03:04:13,790
all of the side effects of the bonds of 
grand juror,

4051
03:04:13,940 --> 03:04:16,940
elevated sense of your place in the 
world.

4052
03:04:17,140 --> 03:04:22,140
Like all the is the president and on top
elevated sense of the president.

4053
03:04:22,581 --> 03:04:23,790
Wow.
That is great.

4054
03:04:23,850 --> 03:04:26,630
I'm the president of the world.
I think he thinks he is,

4055
03:04:26,631 --> 03:04:28,190
but he is.
He's.

4056
03:04:28,210 --> 03:04:30,260
He's fucking.
But it'd be visa president,

4057
03:04:30,261 --> 03:04:32,110
United States.
You're basically a pretty much president

4058
03:04:32,111 --> 03:04:32,841
of the world.
Yeah.

4059
03:04:32,841 --> 03:04:36,650
Yeah.
At least if there's a number one through

4060
03:04:36,651 --> 03:04:38,120
10,
your number one.

4061
03:04:38,180 --> 03:04:38,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

4062
03:04:38,750 --> 03:04:39,583
Alright.
Who's next?

4063
03:04:39,950 --> 03:04:41,870
Who's number two?
That is.

4064
03:04:42,050 --> 03:04:47,050
That's number two.
Is donald fucking trump all day.

4065
03:04:47,930 --> 03:04:50,360
One of my favorite hillary quilts is 
really recently.

4066
03:04:50,361 --> 03:04:52,790
She was,
she said I would like to be president.

4067
03:04:52,910 --> 03:04:54,000
That's what she said.
Oh yeah,

4068
03:04:54,001 --> 03:04:55,370
yeah.
I'd like to be president.

4069
03:04:55,910 --> 03:04:59,720
You should never be president then 
because that's not what the job is.

4070
03:04:59,820 --> 03:05:02,120
That job's not some shit you put on your
resume.

4071
03:05:02,180 --> 03:05:02,900
Right?
Right.

4072
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:04,850
To be president.
Like a cookie.

4073
03:05:05,270 --> 03:05:05,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

4074
03:05:05,810 --> 03:05:08,090
That's what it comes off as,
like to be the queen.

4075
03:05:08,600 --> 03:05:09,680
I was like that.
I would like,

4076
03:05:09,681 --> 03:05:13,400
if you kiss my ass,
I would suck my toes.

4077
03:05:13,880 --> 03:05:18,880
What would you would like it trump.
That's why trump comes off as like a,

4078
03:05:19,280 --> 03:05:22,670
just a bad stand up when he does those 
rallies and everything.

4079
03:05:22,880 --> 03:05:25,370
Like you can tell when he's squinting at
the prompter.

4080
03:05:25,660 --> 03:05:26,493
And he was like,
we as americans must blah blah blah 

4081
03:05:27,801 --> 03:05:28,634
blah.
And then you see his eyes open and he's 

4082
03:05:29,670 --> 03:05:32,360
like,
so let me tell you if he's all prompter.

4083
03:05:32,361 --> 03:05:34,010
And that's when I go,
oh,

4084
03:05:34,011 --> 03:05:36,170
here it comes.
Here comes a winner.

4085
03:05:36,570 --> 03:05:37,403
And when he,
when he talks about ice and he's like 

4086
03:05:39,500 --> 03:05:42,200
the men and women of ice,
just amazing people.

4087
03:05:42,500 --> 03:05:44,600
A job that none of us want to do.
We don't want to do.

4088
03:05:44,720 --> 03:05:47,060
And then he starts the crowd.
Work this guy over here,

4089
03:05:47,061 --> 03:05:48,260
look at him.
He didn't want to do it.

4090
03:05:48,760 --> 03:05:53,240
His wife knows what he's doing.
Crowd work like fuck.

4091
03:05:53,241 --> 03:05:57,530
It's the president.
It's so fucking bizarre.

4092
03:05:57,560 --> 03:05:58,393
Do you remember that one?
Ninety minute speech that he gave this 

4093
03:06:00,620 --> 03:06:01,453
rambling nonsense that people go,
this is the day the presidency 

4094
03:06:03,411 --> 03:06:05,870
unraveled.
It was two years ago.

4095
03:06:06,250 --> 03:06:09,920
That shit was forever ago.
And he's still unraveling.

4096
03:06:09,921 --> 03:06:10,510
It's,
it's,

4097
03:06:10,510 --> 03:06:11,840
uh,
he's not even unraveling.

4098
03:06:11,841 --> 03:06:14,300
It's just who he is.
Do we go back to the,

4099
03:06:14,301 --> 03:06:15,134
you know,
this guy as a whole and what we knew to 

4100
03:06:17,841 --> 03:06:18,674
do because guaranteed in 2020,
that's going to be the pitch against 

4101
03:06:21,891 --> 03:06:22,724
trump.
We need to return to some semblance of 

4102
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:26,673
society.
It's going to be a young democratic 

4103
03:06:28,821 --> 03:06:29,654
socialist type character that says a lot
of things that the young people want to 

4104
03:06:32,421 --> 03:06:33,100
hear.

4105
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:35,660
And then it's like a completely anti 
racist,

4106
03:06:35,661 --> 03:06:38,270
anti homophobic trans rights,
all that stuff.

4107
03:06:38,660 --> 03:06:39,493
That's what I think.
Someone who can hold it together and 

4108
03:06:42,591 --> 03:06:45,830
someone doesn't have a good fucking box 
above in the closet.

4109
03:06:46,790 --> 03:06:49,250
That's getting tougher and tougher to 
find these days.

4110
03:06:49,280 --> 03:06:50,113
Man,
there is some shit just fucking 

4111
03:06:52,280 --> 03:06:54,750
graveyards falling out of people's 
closets.

4112
03:06:54,790 --> 03:06:58,650
It's people that want to be in power 
that all have these fucking skeletons.

4113
03:06:59,540 --> 03:07:00,373
What's the weird things?
Is these people that want to be in 

4114
03:07:02,611 --> 03:07:03,840
power?
Yeah,

4115
03:07:04,650 --> 03:07:06,720
I think it's hilarious.
Like you look at the.

4116
03:07:06,721 --> 03:07:07,554
I'm a politician like you just described
at a rally or a speech and behind them 

4117
03:07:11,851 --> 03:07:14,790
is just,
it's so well choreographed,

4118
03:07:15,060 --> 03:07:19,320
like every nationality is represented 
and you know,

4119
03:07:19,321 --> 03:07:23,490
you just see it looks like something out
of a fucking star trek episode that hats

4120
03:07:23,491 --> 03:07:24,324
from different lands and all kinds of 
things and it's like that to me is just 

4121
03:07:28,141 --> 03:07:33,141
as fake and and potentially offensive as
just the trump background.

4122
03:07:35,100 --> 03:07:39,660
White trash is like laura dern running 
star trek or star wars.

4123
03:07:39,770 --> 03:07:42,270
Just what it's like bring it back.
Yes.

4124
03:07:42,300 --> 03:07:43,530
It's like,
oh,

4125
03:07:43,531 --> 03:07:44,670
okay.
I see what you're doing.

4126
03:07:44,720 --> 03:07:47,220
Now that laura dern is a bad actress.
She's a great actress.

4127
03:07:47,280 --> 03:07:51,690
But in that role and in this situation 
and when she's like telling the pilot to

4128
03:07:51,691 --> 03:07:54,120
shut up and listen,
stop guys.

4129
03:07:54,130 --> 03:07:57,840
A fucking straight up killer is out 
there flying as a pilot.

4130
03:07:58,210 --> 03:07:59,043
Piloting a spaceship,
getting down evil robots and want to 

4131
03:08:02,131 --> 03:08:02,964
blow up the planet.
He's really going to be intimidated by 

4132
03:08:05,280 --> 03:08:08,280
laura dern.
I remember when we first started running

4133
03:08:08,281 --> 03:08:10,350
this empathic,
shut the fuck up.

4134
03:08:10,440 --> 03:08:12,930
She's forced fed.
Just force fed.

4135
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:14,593
Yeah.

4136
03:08:16,590 --> 03:08:19,410
These,
these really obvious.

4137
03:08:19,730 --> 03:08:24,060
There's this theatrical plays at 
diversity and inclusiveness,

4138
03:08:24,430 --> 03:08:26,360
aggressiveness and you could tell that 
they,

4139
03:08:26,361 --> 03:08:29,100
like they've pushed every,
there's no authenticity to their,

4140
03:08:29,120 --> 03:08:29,953
their message.
They have to push every correct button 

4141
03:08:32,401 --> 03:08:35,520
and say all the right notes and make all
the right sounds.

4142
03:08:35,521 --> 03:08:36,270
It's.
Yeah.

4143
03:08:36,270 --> 03:08:37,680
Yeah.
It's like this thing,

4144
03:08:37,681 --> 03:08:38,090
they're,
they're,

4145
03:08:38,090 --> 03:08:42,180
they're complying.
It's a compliance thing as much as it is

4146
03:08:42,330 --> 03:08:43,163
an expression of who they are as 
individuals and have to be compliant 

4147
03:08:47,491 --> 03:08:50,070
with this new,
this new way.

4148
03:08:50,071 --> 03:08:53,430
People are thinking and behaving but,
but it's so ham handed,

4149
03:08:53,460 --> 03:08:55,590
like,
like it's really over the top.

4150
03:08:55,620 --> 03:08:58,020
It's obvious.
It's like a guy named wiener pulling his

4151
03:08:58,021 --> 03:09:00,240
dick out.
It's not too obvious.

4152
03:09:00,241 --> 03:09:01,590
It's too clunky,
too.

4153
03:09:01,591 --> 03:09:02,424
Right on the head.
You know what I heard that some of the 

4154
03:09:04,501 --> 03:09:07,060
movies that are coming out,
um,

4155
03:09:07,260 --> 03:09:10,650
I think they're doing a girl version of 
bad boys.

4156
03:09:10,910 --> 03:09:12,030
Oh,
which is like,

4157
03:09:12,240 --> 03:09:15,930
why the fuck they doing ghostbusters,
like ghost busters,

4158
03:09:15,931 --> 03:09:17,820
which was such a success.
Uh,

4159
03:09:17,840 --> 03:09:21,090
and then I saw this.
Isn't my logo kicked off a twitter?

4160
03:09:21,150 --> 03:09:21,920
Yeah.
Yeah,

4161
03:09:21,920 --> 03:09:22,840
like goofing on.
Uh,

4162
03:09:22,860 --> 03:09:24,130
what's her name there?
I'm leslie.

4163
03:09:24,160 --> 03:09:25,290
Leslie jones.
Yeah.

4164
03:09:25,470 --> 03:09:26,740
Yeah.
So I,

4165
03:09:26,741 --> 03:09:29,180
I read this the other day,
uh,

4166
03:09:29,700 --> 03:09:30,533
there's a broadway show of king kong is 
now a broadway musical and they have 

4167
03:09:35,551 --> 03:09:40,551
this amazing kind of marionette gorilla 
on the stage giant fucking thing.

4168
03:09:42,570 --> 03:09:44,990
And the girl that plays a,
an darrow,

4169
03:09:45,380 --> 03:09:46,250
uh,
and,

4170
03:09:46,290 --> 03:09:50,760
and now a new girl has been cast.
She's black now.

4171
03:09:50,761 --> 03:09:53,860
I'm like this,
the whole gist

4172
03:09:54,130 --> 03:09:57,490
of king kong is the fact that it's a 
white broad,

4173
03:09:57,790 --> 03:10:00,970
like the whole island is full of black 
chicks.

4174
03:10:01,120 --> 03:10:01,751
Whoa.
This,

4175
03:10:01,751 --> 03:10:05,290
this marionette king kong picks her up.
What's up with his face?

4176
03:10:05,440 --> 03:10:06,670
I don't know.
They had to make them,

4177
03:10:06,671 --> 03:10:07,740
you know,
almost uh,

4178
03:10:07,970 --> 03:10:08,803
you know,
the characters look in the lion king 

4179
03:10:10,480 --> 03:10:11,860
musical.
Something weird.

4180
03:10:12,070 --> 03:10:13,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

4181
03:10:13,660 --> 03:10:15,970
So is that,
that's all I'm marrying it yet.

4182
03:10:15,971 --> 03:10:18,040
It's like a fucking,
it's on cables and,

4183
03:10:18,041 --> 03:10:22,050
and shit and just people working it.
And how strange it.

4184
03:10:22,060 --> 03:10:22,893
If you,
if there's a video clip of it and you 

4185
03:10:24,311 --> 03:10:25,810
see it kind of move,
it's a.

4186
03:10:26,020 --> 03:10:28,270
It is strange.
We got to see a video,

4187
03:10:28,660 --> 03:10:31,630
but like I said,
the whole fucking thing is based on.

4188
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:33,310
It's the white chick.
Yeah,

4189
03:10:33,670 --> 03:10:34,700
like,
like it,

4190
03:10:34,780 --> 03:10:37,180
it's part of the story.
I can understand.

4191
03:10:37,181 --> 03:10:39,760
You can cast a black actress and a white
actress as part as that,

4192
03:10:39,900 --> 03:10:43,230
but when it's so integral to the story 
that this fucking got.

4193
03:10:43,240 --> 03:10:44,170
Yeah,
that's sick.

4194
03:10:44,290 --> 03:10:45,580
That's amazing.
Yeah.

4195
03:10:45,581 --> 03:10:47,650
Yeah.
It looks pretty fucking bad ass.

4196
03:10:47,651 --> 03:10:50,770
But where's this for?
What's this guy get out of their buddy?

4197
03:10:52,240 --> 03:10:53,710
Wow.
This is amazing.

4198
03:10:53,780 --> 03:10:54,613
Yeah.
Isn't that second a fucking a broadway 

4199
03:10:55,991 --> 03:10:59,500
stage?
They got all this that's going on.

4200
03:10:59,530 --> 03:11:01,490
It really is.
That really is amazing.

4201
03:11:01,510 --> 03:11:03,100
They got the teeth lit up and 
everything.

4202
03:11:03,670 --> 03:11:04,503
Yeah.
The lighting is pretty important and 

4203
03:11:06,810 --> 03:11:07,010
pretty

4204
03:11:07,010 --> 03:11:08,540
bad ass.
So this was the old one.

4205
03:11:08,570 --> 03:11:09,920
The old one used to be a blonde chick.

4206
03:11:09,980 --> 03:11:10,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

4207
03:11:10,930 --> 03:11:12,790
No,
not anymore in our hands.

4208
03:11:13,150 --> 03:11:17,760
We're going to get a black trans man.
I mean,

4209
03:11:17,770 --> 03:11:18,603
the whole gimmick is that kang has been 
on this island with black chicks and he 

4210
03:11:22,211 --> 03:11:24,370
sees her and just loses his fucking 
mind.

4211
03:11:24,420 --> 03:11:25,253
Yeah.
I have a whole bit of bike hurt it the 

4212
03:11:26,021 --> 03:11:27,460
other night.
It's the fucking brilliant.

4213
03:11:27,910 --> 03:11:30,160
It's so goddamn funny.
But it is true.

4214
03:11:30,161 --> 03:11:33,810
It's like that movie is like the most 
racist movie of all time.

4215
03:11:33,811 --> 03:11:38,811
All right.
So when,

4216
03:11:39,330 --> 03:11:43,030
when the remake came out,
I think it was Peter Jackson remake came

4217
03:11:43,031 --> 03:11:43,980
out,
um,

4218
03:11:44,020 --> 03:11:44,853
patrice went off on it and did a whole 
thing about what the movie represents 

4219
03:11:48,911 --> 03:11:49,744
and what the chicken and the gorilla 
represents an hour and it was fucking 

4220
03:11:52,631 --> 03:11:55,150
brilliant.
Only as patrice could have done it.

4221
03:11:55,550 --> 03:11:56,530
Uh,
and he,

4222
03:11:56,590 --> 03:11:57,550
you know,
he nailed it.

4223
03:11:57,700 --> 03:12:00,610
Do you know the movie frozen?
The little kids moving.

4224
03:12:00,970 --> 03:12:03,460
I never saw it.
Girl who

4225
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:04,353
can fucking turning things into ice.
There's a disney version of live does 

4226
03:12:09,601 --> 03:12:14,601
diversion that they've decided to do.
And in the live disney version there,

4227
03:12:14,971 --> 03:12:18,040
the girl is now played by a black girl,
but it's,

4228
03:12:18,160 --> 03:12:21,040
it's a blonde girl who lives in like 
Norway.

4229
03:12:21,420 --> 03:12:25,900
It doesn't make sense.
They've decided to have her be played by

4230
03:12:25,901 --> 03:12:29,200
a black girl and people went crazy.
They send all these emails in like,

4231
03:12:29,201 --> 03:12:30,900
this is outrageous,
like what are you do?

4232
03:12:30,901 --> 03:12:31,840
And it's like,
yeah,

4233
03:12:31,870 --> 03:12:34,840
but I feel like these companies,
they,

4234
03:12:34,930 --> 03:12:37,270
it's,
there's too many people involved.

4235
03:12:37,271 --> 03:12:38,830
Right.
It's not like compound media.

4236
03:12:38,831 --> 03:12:40,570
It's just the anthony kumi and making 
decisions.

4237
03:12:40,610 --> 03:12:42,910
Right.
With something like disney,

4238
03:12:43,240 --> 03:12:46,780
you have this board and you probably in 
California,

4239
03:12:46,781 --> 03:12:48,520
you have to have a certain amount of 
women on the board.

4240
03:12:48,521 --> 03:12:49,980
Right?
Imagine what that must be like.

4241
03:12:50,030 --> 03:12:52,340
You have to have equal

4242
03:12:52,340 --> 03:12:53,173
representation of everyone.
Everyone's super concerned about 

4243
03:12:55,761 --> 03:12:58,400
diversity,
like at a fundraising pitch to show.

4244
03:12:59,300 --> 03:13:00,133
And when they walked in there,
the first question they said he pitched 

4245
03:13:02,961 --> 03:13:03,471
the show.
They go,

4246
03:13:03,471 --> 03:13:05,090
okay,
where's the diversity?

4247
03:13:06,170 --> 03:13:09,350
Where's the diversity?
Like he was pitching a sitcom.

4248
03:13:10,040 --> 03:13:11,210
Where's the diversity?
It's like,

4249
03:13:12,810 --> 03:13:14,580
I'm just pitching you something funny.
A pitch.

4250
03:13:14,581 --> 03:13:16,030
You a funny program.
Yeah,

4251
03:13:16,050 --> 03:13:16,640
yeah.
Okay.

4252
03:13:16,640 --> 03:13:18,830
We need a,
we need an asian man,

4253
03:13:19,280 --> 03:13:21,320
black woman.
We needed this and that.

4254
03:13:21,350 --> 03:13:22,620
And again,
like we were talking about it,

4255
03:13:22,630 --> 03:13:25,730
it's so obvious that it becomes 
distracting.

4256
03:13:26,030 --> 03:13:26,863
Like I don't want.
I don't want to have to watch something 

4257
03:13:29,991 --> 03:13:32,690
that,
that diversity is just forced in there.

4258
03:13:32,770 --> 03:13:33,830
Right,
because you,

4259
03:13:33,831 --> 03:13:34,664
you notice it and now you're distracted 
and you can't really enjoy the things 

4260
03:13:37,280 --> 03:13:39,440
like that king kong thing,
like how do you,

4261
03:13:39,620 --> 03:13:42,180
how do they do the part where the,
the,

4262
03:13:42,181 --> 03:13:45,860
the natives on skull island,
a kong is just like ah,

4263
03:13:45,861 --> 03:13:47,300
get outta here,
but this one is like,

4264
03:13:47,301 --> 03:13:48,190
oh,
this,

4265
03:13:48,790 --> 03:13:49,623
there has to be something different and 
it's definitely the hair color and skin 

4266
03:13:53,561 --> 03:13:53,790
guy.

4267
03:13:53,790 --> 03:13:54,623
It's just what it was.
It's regardless of how horrible it is 

4268
03:13:57,531 --> 03:13:58,820
or,
or whatever past.

4269
03:13:58,821 --> 03:14:00,170
That's just the way it is.
Roll up.

4270
03:14:00,200 --> 03:14:01,520
Right and move on.
I.

4271
03:14:01,550 --> 03:14:03,770
Yeah.
Time has passed you by old man.

4272
03:14:04,580 --> 03:14:06,160
Old white dude.
Yeah.

4273
03:14:06,200 --> 03:14:08,570
Oh,
old white dude doesn't like when a black

4274
03:14:08,571 --> 03:14:12,830
woman gets her role for all black women,
all white women.

4275
03:14:13,210 --> 03:14:14,043
There are so many instances where that's
fine and no one would notice and 

4276
03:14:17,121 --> 03:14:18,140
whatever.
I don't even,

4277
03:14:18,170 --> 03:14:20,870
I don't have a problem with hamilton or 
whatever.

4278
03:14:20,871 --> 03:14:21,704
They want to cast founding fathers as 
black and hispanic dudes whatevs go at 

4279
03:14:26,121 --> 03:14:26,954
it.
But like when it's an integral part of 

4280
03:14:29,001 --> 03:14:31,360
the story,
it's most of the stories.

4281
03:14:31,400 --> 03:14:34,160
It's most of the reason why loses his 
mind.

4282
03:14:34,380 --> 03:14:36,980
He falls in love with the white chick a 
whole time.

4283
03:14:37,070 --> 03:14:39,800
He's.
He's on camera in the movie.

4284
03:14:40,380 --> 03:14:41,213
He's.
They're losing his mind because of the 

4285
03:14:42,411 --> 03:14:46,650
white chick that,
yeah,

4286
03:14:47,030 --> 03:14:47,863
just don't make a movie then just don't,
don't make the movie or don't make the 

4287
03:14:51,681 --> 03:14:52,520
play the.

4288
03:14:52,520 --> 03:14:53,353
I didn't get to make the playbook.
We're going to have a black woman of 

4289
03:14:54,891 --> 03:14:55,724
color.
I'm going to have a young woman of 

4290
03:14:56,691 --> 03:14:57,524
color.
That's my favorite criticisms is how 

4291
03:15:00,981 --> 03:15:04,850
dare to white people have this 
discussion without a person of color.

4292
03:15:04,910 --> 03:15:05,601
Well,
that's true.

4293
03:15:05,601 --> 03:15:06,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

4294
03:15:06,350 --> 03:15:09,140
We'll probably catch shit for this,
but it's from who?

4295
03:15:09,590 --> 03:15:11,450
From who?
That can go fuck themselves.

4296
03:15:12,150 --> 03:15:14,570
Who would you propose this idea?
The idea that.

4297
03:15:14,571 --> 03:15:15,291
Wait,
hold on.

4298
03:15:15,291 --> 03:15:16,760
Anthony.
Before we go any further,

4299
03:15:16,880 --> 03:15:18,650
let's bring it a person of color.
Yeah.

4300
03:15:18,651 --> 03:15:20,000
Yeah.
A person of color.

4301
03:15:20,110 --> 03:15:21,250
How should we.
We are.

4302
03:15:21,310 --> 03:15:23,410
We were too privileged people.
We shouldn't be discussing.

4303
03:15:23,540 --> 03:15:24,373
That is true.
But you can't even communicate about 

4304
03:15:25,701 --> 03:15:26,180
something.
No,

4305
03:15:26,180 --> 03:15:27,013
no you can't.
And all we hear about is how we need an 

4306
03:15:29,030 --> 03:15:29,863
open and honest discussion about race.
And then the second year try to half 

4307
03:15:32,950 --> 03:15:35,390
one,
shut up.

4308
03:15:35,450 --> 03:15:36,283
Don't talk about.
Here's one that everybody keeps 

4309
03:15:37,401 --> 03:15:39,500
ignoring.
You want to know what's racist?

4310
03:15:39,650 --> 03:15:43,490
Harvard tries really hard to keep asian 
people out.

4311
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:43,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

4312
03:15:43,930 --> 03:15:44,763
Make you get way more difficult because 
asian people are far better at school 

4313
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:49,980
than white people.

4314
03:15:50,010 --> 03:15:52,900
Just the way it is.
And they have to balance it.

4315
03:15:53,200 --> 03:15:56,890
It would be full of asians if everybody 
was,

4316
03:15:57,450 --> 03:15:59,700
uh,
got accepted for qualifications,

4317
03:16:00,060 --> 03:16:01,980
that would be asian,
harvard.

4318
03:16:02,010 --> 03:16:02,843
But it is amazing.
The people that are rallying against 

4319
03:16:04,921 --> 03:16:05,754
racial discrimination don't look at that
because that is absolute racial 

4320
03:16:08,491 --> 03:16:10,560
discrimination.
But on the other end of the spectrum,

4321
03:16:10,640 --> 03:16:11,160
right,
right.

4322
03:16:11,160 --> 03:16:14,820
You're taking these people that are,
they are a minority.

4323
03:16:14,950 --> 03:16:15,783
There are a small percentage of the 
population and they vastly outperform 

4324
03:16:18,990 --> 03:16:20,110
most other groups.
Yeah.

4325
03:16:20,140 --> 03:16:21,300
Yeah.
And because of that,

4326
03:16:21,301 --> 03:16:23,640
harvard has made it more difficult for 
them to get in.

4327
03:16:23,641 --> 03:16:24,474
And now there's a giant class action 
lawsuit against one of the most liberal 

4328
03:16:27,001 --> 03:16:31,620
and progressive institutes of higher 
learning ever racist.

4329
03:16:31,680 --> 03:16:34,830
They're fucking undeniably racist is 
racist.

4330
03:16:34,890 --> 03:16:37,620
Yeah.
It's the superior people.

4331
03:16:37,650 --> 03:16:41,460
It's absolutely based on nothing but 
someone's race,

4332
03:16:41,461 --> 03:16:43,680
ethnic background and uh,
they're,

4333
03:16:43,681 --> 03:16:44,514
they're doing it.

4334
03:16:44,620 --> 03:16:46,650
Yeah.
They're doing it for now,

4335
03:16:46,830 --> 03:16:47,663
for now.
But you don't hear about this from the 

4336
03:16:48,811 --> 03:16:49,644
social justice warriors and now no race 
baiters they want to go on about white 

4337
03:16:52,441 --> 03:16:54,790
privilege and yeah,
it,

4338
03:16:54,880 --> 03:16:56,010
it really is.
Look,

4339
03:16:56,090 --> 03:16:56,923
I,
I just like bringing shit up that I 

4340
03:16:58,411 --> 03:16:59,244
notice and if I notice that they're 
squeezing diversity into something that 

4341
03:17:02,701 --> 03:17:04,140
doesn't need it,
I,

4342
03:17:04,141 --> 03:17:07,800
I think it looks like I said distracting
and it's out of place.

4343
03:17:07,980 --> 03:17:10,470
And then other things,
like the other day I noticed,

4344
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:11,290
uh,
and,

4345
03:17:11,290 --> 03:17:13,920
and you probably shouldn't even say it,
that the,

4346
03:17:13,921 --> 03:17:14,754
a mars probe that just landed on mars 
and they showed the control room at jet 

4347
03:17:18,901 --> 03:17:21,840
propulsion laboratories and they're all 
applauding.

4348
03:17:22,590 --> 03:17:26,310
Could possibly be the least diverse room
I've ever seen in my life.

4349
03:17:26,680 --> 03:17:29,610
A bunch of white nerds.
That's all it was.

4350
03:17:29,790 --> 03:17:32,880
There were a couple of like a big women,
like,

4351
03:17:32,881 --> 03:17:34,400
like a kind of,
you know,

4352
03:17:34,860 --> 03:17:36,090
lesbians,
lesbians,

4353
03:17:36,710 --> 03:17:39,450
a couple of them in there.

4354
03:17:39,720 --> 03:17:40,553
But for the most part,
it was every nerdy guy grown up and 

4355
03:17:43,950 --> 03:17:48,950
landing a fucking spec,
a billion miles away on fucking mars.

4356
03:17:50,740 --> 03:17:55,200
It's insane because when it push comes 
to shove,

4357
03:17:55,230 --> 03:17:59,580
you need the people that can get the job
done and if it's that room of people,

4358
03:17:59,581 --> 03:18:00,414
it's that room of people.
You can't artificially diversify 

4359
03:18:04,141 --> 03:18:08,220
something just for the optic and get the
job done.

4360
03:18:08,250 --> 03:18:10,800
They had.
Everyone in that room had a reason to be

4361
03:18:10,801 --> 03:18:13,560
there and I assume it's based on 
qualifications,

4362
03:18:13,770 --> 03:18:18,770
but if you notice that or mention it,
I'm sure I'll be called a fucking racist

4363
03:18:18,931 --> 03:18:19,740
for that.
Yeah,

4364
03:18:19,740 --> 03:18:20,573
for sure.
Don't ever notice things you can't 

4365
03:18:21,880 --> 03:18:23,820
switch.
The rule is don't notice.

4366
03:18:23,821 --> 03:18:25,540
Trends.
Don't notice things.

4367
03:18:25,541 --> 03:18:28,200
I feel like that's going away though.
You really do.

4368
03:18:28,880 --> 03:18:30,540
I just,
I don't see it lasting.

4369
03:18:30,990 --> 03:18:33,320
I just,
I feel like it's a,

4370
03:18:33,321 --> 03:18:34,154
a bright wave of nonsense that's hitting
us and it's going to balance back out 

4371
03:18:38,521 --> 03:18:40,090
and rational thinking is,
can you.

4372
03:18:40,100 --> 03:18:42,210
Here's the thing,
this is one of the things that drives me

4373
03:18:42,211 --> 03:18:43,110
crazy.
It's like,

4374
03:18:43,440 --> 03:18:45,630
you know,
address your white privilege.

4375
03:18:45,631 --> 03:18:47,470
Recognize your white privilege.
No.

4376
03:18:47,530 --> 03:18:48,363
You know why

4377
03:18:48,490 --> 03:18:49,900
I'm not racist?
Okay,

4378
03:18:49,901 --> 03:18:52,750
so if I'm not racist,
you should be concentrating on racism.

4379
03:18:52,990 --> 03:18:53,823
He shouldn't be concentrating on people 
who don't experience racism because 

4380
03:18:57,071 --> 03:18:59,290
there fortunately white,
because I didn't do anything,

4381
03:18:59,380 --> 03:19:00,213
didn't do anything just by being,
but what they're doing is they're 

4382
03:19:01,751 --> 03:19:02,584
putting you in a position where you're 
always guilty and once they put you in 

4383
03:19:05,231 --> 03:19:06,064
that box,
they always can shut you up because 

4384
03:19:08,081 --> 03:19:11,500
there the logic is not very good.
So the discourse is not.

4385
03:19:11,501 --> 03:19:14,050
It's not well thought out.
It's not really nuanced.

4386
03:19:14,200 --> 03:19:15,033
So because of that,
they want to be able to just push a 

4387
03:19:16,691 --> 03:19:17,524
button and shut you off.
That button is the white privilege 

4388
03:19:19,901 --> 03:19:20,980
button.
But that's.

4389
03:19:21,010 --> 03:19:23,380
You're looking at.
You're looking at a reality.

4390
03:19:23,381 --> 03:19:24,214
Yeah.
Do white people have it easier than 

4391
03:19:24,941 --> 03:19:27,220
people who get racially discriminated 
against?

4392
03:19:27,280 --> 03:19:28,113
Yes,
but the problem is not the white people 

4393
03:19:29,021 --> 03:19:29,854
that have it easy.
The problem is the people that racially 

4394
03:19:31,271 --> 03:19:32,570
discriminate.
Yeah.

4395
03:19:32,571 --> 03:19:34,780
Yeah.
So you're looking at the wrong thing.

4396
03:19:34,870 --> 03:19:35,703
So you're finding somebody you want to 
make them a bad person just by being 

4397
03:19:39,310 --> 03:19:40,260
the.
The,

4398
03:19:40,300 --> 03:19:43,030
the thing that you've decided is the 
oppressor.

4399
03:19:43,240 --> 03:19:44,590
Yeah.
It's a racist thing.

4400
03:19:44,810 --> 03:19:45,643
Everything is the same level,
whether you have an opinion about 

4401
03:19:48,471 --> 03:19:49,304
something,
just voicing an opinion about something 

4402
03:19:51,261 --> 03:19:54,200
that involves race or sexuality or 
whatever it is,

4403
03:19:54,620 --> 03:19:58,890
and literally calling for violence 
against people of.

4404
03:19:59,360 --> 03:20:02,480
It's all in the same category when it's 
ridiculous.

4405
03:20:02,600 --> 03:20:03,433
You could have your,
your personal opinion on anything that 

4406
03:20:06,410 --> 03:20:07,970
is sensitive these days,
like I said,

4407
03:20:07,971 --> 03:20:08,804
race or sexuality or what have you.
It doesn't mean anything unless you use 

4408
03:20:14,180 --> 03:20:18,560
some kind of negativity or oppression or
something against,

4409
03:20:18,780 --> 03:20:21,290
uh,
the person because of your opinion.

4410
03:20:21,590 --> 03:20:23,120
Uh,
until you do that,

4411
03:20:23,150 --> 03:20:27,800
you just have a fucking opinion and it's
not all that dangerous.

4412
03:20:28,250 --> 03:20:30,050
Uh,
patrice used to say that too.

4413
03:20:30,051 --> 03:20:30,884
He goes,
I never met a racist in my life because 

4414
03:20:32,240 --> 03:20:33,073
I never met one,
never sat down and had someone calling 

4415
03:20:36,080 --> 03:20:38,540
the n word or anything like that.
He goes to never met one.

4416
03:20:38,580 --> 03:20:39,800
He's been in the wrong places.

4417
03:20:39,870 --> 03:20:43,040
Maybe take them to some places,
but,

4418
03:20:43,180 --> 03:20:44,013
but it's like,
let's say you have somebody that has a 

4419
03:20:46,491 --> 03:20:49,120
low opinion of,
of black people and,

4420
03:20:49,130 --> 03:20:49,963
and just go into a bar.
You sit down and there's a black dude 

4421
03:20:52,581 --> 03:20:55,430
sitting there and watching the yankee 
game or something and go,

4422
03:20:55,431 --> 03:20:56,210
uh,
uh,

4423
03:20:56,210 --> 03:20:56,990
he goes,
hey,

4424
03:20:56,990 --> 03:20:58,310
look at that.
The yankees are winning.

4425
03:20:58,980 --> 03:21:01,310
D is the guy gotta to turn around and 
go,

4426
03:21:01,311 --> 03:21:04,160
fuck you dropping bombs or is it going 
to go?

4427
03:21:04,161 --> 03:21:05,300
Yeah,
I guess so.

4428
03:21:05,420 --> 03:21:06,620
Like,
like there's,

4429
03:21:06,650 --> 03:21:09,030
there's levels of,
of that.

4430
03:21:09,050 --> 03:21:09,883
He might have an idea about it,
but until you start exercising that I 

4431
03:21:13,370 --> 03:21:15,530
don't honestly don't see a problem with 
it.

4432
03:21:15,920 --> 03:21:17,170
This piece of discrimination eight,

4433
03:21:17,310 --> 03:21:21,420
and they have discrim discriminatory 
ideas about all sorts of things.

4434
03:21:21,780 --> 03:21:22,613
It's just when you allow some but don't 
allow others when you allow 

4435
03:21:26,941 --> 03:21:30,300
discrimination against white people,
but you don't allow it against black.

4436
03:21:31,170 --> 03:21:34,140
Create resentment when you allow 
discrimination against men,

4437
03:21:34,290 --> 03:21:35,123
but don't allow it against women because
you feel like women have been 

4438
03:21:37,171 --> 03:21:38,820
victimized.
So it's our time.

4439
03:21:38,970 --> 03:21:41,550
It's our turn will know it doesn't work 
that way.

4440
03:21:41,750 --> 03:21:43,590
It doesn't work that way.
Especially when you're talking to people

4441
03:21:43,591 --> 03:21:44,424
that aren't rapists.
Call everybody a rapist and the people 

4442
03:21:47,121 --> 03:21:48,080
who aren't rapists,
you go,

4443
03:21:48,081 --> 03:21:49,070
oh,
okay.

4444
03:21:49,071 --> 03:21:50,630
So you think everybody's a rapist will 
you?

4445
03:21:50,631 --> 03:21:52,740
Will you are fucking crazy.
And then they start changing what?

4446
03:21:52,741 --> 03:21:53,360
Rape,

4447
03:21:53,360 --> 03:21:53,901
right?
Yeah.

4448
03:21:53,901 --> 03:21:54,810
Yeah.
Well that's what the,

4449
03:21:54,890 --> 03:21:57,800
that's kind of what they've done.
I mean obviously the uh,

4450
03:21:58,220 --> 03:21:59,053
like the louis ck situation,
I know that is so people are so divided 

4451
03:22:02,481 --> 03:22:03,314
on that one and my opinion is if,
if he didn't do anything or make anyone 

4452
03:22:09,711 --> 03:22:10,544
do anything against their will,
he's just a guy that has a strange 

4453
03:22:14,091 --> 03:22:15,560
proclivity,
you know,

4454
03:22:15,561 --> 03:22:16,394
he likes jerking off in front of people.
Apparently the cat's out of the bag 

4455
03:22:18,951 --> 03:22:23,660
there,
but like where those girls that upset 20

4456
03:22:23,661 --> 03:22:27,590
years ago with a that upset 20 years ago
that,

4457
03:22:27,710 --> 03:22:30,830
that now it's an issue or with a giggle 
where they let,

4458
03:22:30,831 --> 03:22:31,664
like I need to know how they were then 
because I don't give a fuck what you 

4459
03:22:34,581 --> 03:22:36,950
think now.
Like at the time,

4460
03:22:37,520 --> 03:22:38,780
what was it?
Okay.

4461
03:22:38,781 --> 03:22:39,630
Was it cool with you?
Oh,

4462
03:22:39,631 --> 03:22:43,370
did you sit there and fucking rib the 
elbow to the ribs with you girlfriend?

4463
03:22:43,371 --> 03:22:45,110
I go look at this guy jerking off in 
front of us.

4464
03:22:45,460 --> 03:22:47,720
Uh,
to me,

4465
03:22:48,110 --> 03:22:51,210
I don't care what,
what time is done because it,

4466
03:22:51,320 --> 03:22:51,951
the,
the,

4467
03:22:51,951 --> 03:22:53,480
the,
the way something looks,

4468
03:22:53,630 --> 03:22:58,630
the morality or ethics or respect that 
is expected in 2018 ain't what it was 20

4469
03:23:00,321 --> 03:23:01,154
years ago.
So you can't be held liable for 

4470
03:23:02,901 --> 03:23:03,734
something you did 20 years ago when it 
was normal or a little strange or 

4471
03:23:07,431 --> 03:23:08,750
whatever the fuck it was.
Well,

4472
03:23:08,751 --> 03:23:10,790
I think it's always been weird to beat 
off in front of people.

4473
03:23:10,850 --> 03:23:12,230
That's an odd thing to do.

4474
03:23:12,530 --> 03:23:15,470
I think about it as though he asked if 
he could write,

4475
03:23:15,620 --> 03:23:17,860
and this is something that I've brought 
up to people go,

4476
03:23:17,890 --> 03:23:18,830
you know,
when people say,

4477
03:23:18,860 --> 03:23:19,340
oh,
you know,

4478
03:23:19,340 --> 03:23:22,130
he would lock these women in the room 
and beat off to stop the.

4479
03:23:22,170 --> 03:23:23,510
If you're to,
if you get like,

4480
03:23:23,511 --> 03:23:24,344
push this,
you're saying that because that fits 

4481
03:23:26,451 --> 03:23:27,284
your narrative.
He's this abusive person who's abusing 

4482
03:23:29,781 --> 03:23:31,550
his power.
Now here's another problem with that.

4483
03:23:31,790 --> 03:23:34,130
When this was all going down,
he wasn't very famous.

4484
03:23:34,400 --> 03:23:35,600
No,
that's just a tosa.

4485
03:23:35,601 --> 03:23:37,280
What power was he abusing it?
He,

4486
03:23:37,370 --> 03:23:38,203
he was a successful comedian.
He was admired by his peers because he 

4487
03:23:41,331 --> 03:23:44,130
was really funny.
He wasn't louis c,

4488
03:23:44,131 --> 03:23:47,300
k like the superstar filling out madison
square garden,

4489
03:23:47,301 --> 03:23:49,400
louis ck.
It wasn't the same guy,

4490
03:23:49,730 --> 03:23:50,240
you know,
he,

4491
03:23:50,240 --> 03:23:51,073
he didn't even have all the hbo specials
and all the netflix specials was the 

4492
03:23:53,690 --> 03:23:54,523
same guy.
So he was just another comic that like 

4493
03:23:56,631 --> 03:23:59,030
to beat off in front of people and he 
would ask first.

4494
03:23:59,270 --> 03:24:01,400
So when you say that he,
you know,

4495
03:24:01,610 --> 03:24:03,710
forced these women and wouldn't let them
leave,

4496
03:24:03,770 --> 03:24:07,550
none of them say that.
In fact he asked and when they said no,

4497
03:24:07,640 --> 03:24:09,470
he didn't do it,
he didn't say,

4498
03:24:09,500 --> 03:24:10,730
oh,
well good.

4499
03:24:10,790 --> 03:24:13,790
You don't want me to beat off that.
Make it feel even better when I beat off

4500
03:24:14,210 --> 03:24:16,700
in front of you.
Shut the fuck up and sit down.

4501
03:24:17,090 --> 03:24:18,090
You know,
he doesn't do anything.

4502
03:24:18,380 --> 03:24:20,150
No.
He was asking which is,

4503
03:24:20,570 --> 03:24:23,480
which is so strange but weird thing.
It's not.

4504
03:24:23,540 --> 03:24:27,810
It's not in the same realm as,
as harvey weinstein's.

4505
03:24:27,811 --> 03:24:28,200
It's not

4506
03:24:28,200 --> 03:24:31,110
even fucking know.
It's not even close.

4507
03:24:31,140 --> 03:24:31,973
It's not even close,
but people don't want you to 

4508
03:24:33,391 --> 03:24:36,630
rationalize.
Don't want you to grade things.

4509
03:24:36,631 --> 03:24:37,464
They just want to talk about abuse.
All abuse gets shoveled into this one 

4510
03:24:40,921 --> 03:24:45,180
little pie chart area like this is male 
abusers,

4511
03:24:45,420 --> 03:24:48,630
and then they'll put matt lauer right 
next to bill cosby,

4512
03:24:48,720 --> 03:24:50,100
right next to louis ck.
Like,

4513
03:24:50,101 --> 03:24:51,870
well,
this seems kind of crazy.

4514
03:24:51,871 --> 03:24:54,000
And then when you say it's crazy,
like matt damon said,

4515
03:24:54,001 --> 03:24:55,800
let's,
I think we should make a distinction.

4516
03:24:56,840 --> 03:24:58,920
Oh yeah,
you can't be,

4517
03:25:01,960 --> 03:25:06,140
you become a rape apologist and say 
things like that.

4518
03:25:06,141 --> 03:25:10,130
And uh,
it's weird because it's odd because even

4519
03:25:10,131 --> 03:25:10,964
saying the word rape these days,
like a little red flag goes off in your 

4520
03:25:14,511 --> 03:25:15,170
head.
Like,

4521
03:25:15,170 --> 03:25:16,450
how did I say that?
Did I say,

4522
03:25:16,970 --> 03:25:19,150
did I say it evil?
And it was a sound.

4523
03:25:19,170 --> 03:25:20,990
Evil are salivating,
right?

4524
03:25:21,100 --> 03:25:21,933
Don't be salivating,
don't smile when you say it's very 

4525
03:25:23,721 --> 03:25:25,480
somber.
It,

4526
03:25:25,810 --> 03:25:27,320
it is strange.
It's this,

4527
03:25:27,321 --> 03:25:29,900
uh,
I use the term all the time because it's

4528
03:25:29,901 --> 03:25:34,740
the only one that really fits orwellian.
Everything is so strange now it,

4529
03:25:35,030 --> 03:25:35,863
if you read 1984 years ago,
you couldn't fathom things getting like 

4530
03:25:40,131 --> 03:25:41,900
that.
But man,

4531
03:25:41,901 --> 03:25:45,380
in some cases it's even worse than,
than expected.

4532
03:25:45,630 --> 03:25:50,000
You think there aren't an unperson you 
don't think there's an unpaid Alex Jones

4533
03:25:50,090 --> 03:25:53,630
unperson wipe them clean from the 
[inaudible] that's it.

4534
03:25:54,040 --> 03:25:54,860
Uh,
the,

4535
03:25:54,860 --> 03:25:55,850
this,
uh,

4536
03:25:56,210 --> 03:25:57,043
new speak words are twisted,
like it means the opposite of what it 

4537
03:26:01,401 --> 03:26:02,390
was supposed to me.

4538
03:26:02,450 --> 03:26:04,010
And,
and uh,

4539
03:26:04,160 --> 03:26:05,100
it,
it,

4540
03:26:05,110 --> 03:26:07,870
it's something that you never thought 
would happen to.

4541
03:26:07,940 --> 03:26:08,773
I always thought like,
we read a book like that or some other 

4542
03:26:10,490 --> 03:26:15,440
kind of this dystopian story.
You get like a,

4543
03:26:15,441 --> 03:26:16,274
a,
like an orb is supposed to be some kind 

4544
03:26:17,841 --> 03:26:21,500
of orb with the government looking at 
you and don't do that,

4545
03:26:21,501 --> 03:26:22,930
sir.
Twenty six,

4546
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:23,601
53.
Oh,

4547
03:26:23,601 --> 03:26:26,780
to sit down and then it's like,
oh fuck.

4548
03:26:26,781 --> 03:26:28,310
It was us.
Oh,

4549
03:26:28,311 --> 03:26:29,690
where the rats,
we,

4550
03:26:29,930 --> 03:26:34,930
we pick up our phone and we rat each 
other out and we're big brother.

4551
03:26:35,091 --> 03:26:40,010
Like we turned out to be the bad guy.
The collective this not the government.

4552
03:26:40,030 --> 03:26:41,300
They like,
like,

4553
03:26:41,301 --> 03:26:42,240
oh boy,
you're going to.

4554
03:26:42,890 --> 03:26:44,780
The government's got to put a tracking 
device on you.

4555
03:26:44,840 --> 03:26:45,673
Fuck that.
He comes to my house and wants to put 

4556
03:26:46,820 --> 03:26:47,660
out.
I'll shoot them.

4557
03:26:47,661 --> 03:26:48,770
I don't care.
Oh,

4558
03:26:48,950 --> 03:26:50,030
you forgot your phone.

4559
03:26:50,490 --> 03:26:51,323
Don't,
don't leave your house without your 

4560
03:26:51,981 --> 03:26:56,090
fucking tracking device,
like it's the same thing and they do use

4561
03:26:56,091 --> 03:26:56,924
those and chronic case,
everything is presented as a 

4562
03:26:59,571 --> 03:27:02,360
convenience.
When I first got easy pass,

4563
03:27:02,361 --> 03:27:03,830
it was like,
this is awesome.

4564
03:27:03,831 --> 03:27:07,040
I don't have to wait on a line at a toll
booth and throw change in or something.

4565
03:27:07,190 --> 03:27:09,170
I'm whizzing right through and then I 
see a story.

4566
03:27:09,171 --> 03:27:09,891
It's like,
oh,

4567
03:27:09,891 --> 03:27:10,724
easy pass use in a divorce case to see 
what the husband was going here or 

4568
03:27:13,270 --> 03:27:14,600
there.
And it's like,

4569
03:27:14,870 --> 03:27:16,130
oh,
that's handy.

4570
03:27:16,400 --> 03:27:17,233
That's handy.
And then you see on the insurance 

4571
03:27:18,171 --> 03:27:19,004
commercials,
it's like,

4572
03:27:19,160 --> 03:27:22,630
use the safe driver thing.
It goes in your car and it acts like a,

4573
03:27:22,800 --> 03:27:24,170
a plain black box.
And,

4574
03:27:24,240 --> 03:27:26,900
and it shows how safety driving they'll 
reduce your rates.

4575
03:27:27,140 --> 03:27:27,973
It's like,
really?

4576
03:27:28,190 --> 03:27:31,220
it's not going to be used if I'm 
speeding again into accident for them to

4577
03:27:31,221 --> 03:27:31,551
go,
yeah,

4578
03:27:31,551 --> 03:27:32,384
we're not paying your fucking thing 
because obviously we'd read that you 

4579
03:27:34,281 --> 03:27:35,850
were speeding and,
uh,

4580
03:27:35,870 --> 03:27:36,703
and,
and didn't stop or like it's all 

4581
03:27:39,320 --> 03:27:41,090
presented as a convenience.

4582
03:27:41,170 --> 03:27:43,840
Alexa,
you literally your tvs,

4583
03:27:43,960 --> 03:27:44,793
they all wrap you out.
It's alexa isn't this magic thing that 

4584
03:27:48,640 --> 03:27:49,473
everything happens internally.
That shit sends everything you say out 

4585
03:27:53,500 --> 03:27:54,333
records it somewhere and then sends 
whatever answer it's supposed to give 

4586
03:27:57,251 --> 03:27:58,084
back back to it and that's what it is.
But everything is saved and do you 

4587
03:28:02,921 --> 03:28:07,270
really know when it's listening and when
your toe you say certain things.

4588
03:28:07,360 --> 03:28:10,450
I had alexa for a little while.
I don't know why all I ever did was like

4589
03:28:10,451 --> 03:28:11,284
alexa,
whether that will tell me the weather I 

4590
03:28:12,341 --> 03:28:13,174
could have checked on my phone and then 
it started doing things like I just be 

4591
03:28:16,031 --> 03:28:19,540
watching tv and it wouldn't be like I 
don't have an answer for that.

4592
03:28:20,320 --> 03:28:20,921
Like,
yeah,

4593
03:28:20,921 --> 03:28:23,290
I don't need that shit.
I don't know what it's doing.

4594
03:28:23,350 --> 03:28:24,183
I don't know what it listening in 
dialogue from the television from maybe 

4595
03:28:26,420 --> 03:28:27,100
the tv.

4596
03:28:27,100 --> 03:28:27,933
Maybe it's just listening to every 
fucking thing I say and sending a 

4597
03:28:31,181 --> 03:28:32,014
transcript somewhere because then you 
could go to the app on your phone and 

4598
03:28:35,590 --> 03:28:39,520
every question you ever asked it is 
listed there in text.

4599
03:28:39,521 --> 03:28:41,350
Fucking form.
Swear to you.

4600
03:28:41,650 --> 03:28:44,920
Every conversation you have with that 
goddamn thing is somewhere.

4601
03:28:44,950 --> 03:28:46,880
Well,
hey dad,

4602
03:28:47,320 --> 03:28:48,850
what are you worried about?
There you go.

4603
03:28:48,910 --> 03:28:49,610
Well,
hey,

4604
03:28:49,610 --> 03:28:50,290
hey.
Hey.

4605
03:28:50,290 --> 03:28:51,990
as long as it keeps us safe.
Right?

4606
03:28:51,991 --> 03:28:54,070
Right.
Can you say about how about yeah,

4607
03:28:54,071 --> 03:28:56,680
if you're not doing anything bad,
well in 10 years,

4608
03:28:56,681 --> 03:28:58,210
will this be bad?
In five years,

4609
03:28:58,211 --> 03:29:00,460
just like shit that 20 years ago it 
wasn't bad.

4610
03:29:00,610 --> 03:29:04,720
Now it's a fucking crime.
You'll be exIled from society.

4611
03:29:04,840 --> 03:29:09,180
I don't know if what I'm saying now can 
be brought up in 10 years and you know,

4612
03:29:09,190 --> 03:29:11,740
when I play video games I say some 
pretty nasty shit,

4613
03:29:13,360 --> 03:29:14,111
but uh,
yeah,

4614
03:29:14,111 --> 03:29:17,010
I don't want to alexa or,
or my smart tv,

4615
03:29:17,040 --> 03:29:17,873
listen to every fucking thing I say and 
record transcripts of what I'm talking 

4616
03:29:21,731 --> 03:29:24,190
about and we bring it in our house.

4617
03:29:24,340 --> 03:29:27,130
No one's forcing you to put this fucking
rad.

4618
03:29:27,140 --> 03:29:30,130
Now's you.
You paid for it,

4619
03:29:30,250 --> 03:29:33,910
you spend money and you put it there and
plugged it in yourself.

4620
03:29:34,270 --> 03:29:38,650
It's amazing how we went from not 
trusting anything.

4621
03:29:38,860 --> 03:29:41,260
I remember when online shopping for a 
started and you're like,

4622
03:29:41,380 --> 03:29:44,360
I'm not putting my credit card in there 
now you're laughing.

4623
03:29:44,410 --> 03:29:45,243
What are you kidding?
You just drove through twin 20 face 

4624
03:29:47,861 --> 03:29:50,800
scanners,
license plate scanners to get here.

4625
03:29:51,170 --> 03:29:54,310
Your,
your card is being picked up by a sensor

4626
03:29:54,810 --> 03:29:57,490
so they can target,
advertise you in the mall,

4627
03:29:57,610 --> 03:30:01,630
so there's no privacy anymore and we 
love it.

4628
03:30:01,780 --> 03:30:03,730
We love that.
There's no privacy.

4629
03:30:03,880 --> 03:30:05,800
I don't want to go to the mall for 
christmas.

4630
03:30:06,070 --> 03:30:06,903
I go to amazon and now there's a lIst of
every fucking thing I buy at amazon 

4631
03:30:10,751 --> 03:30:12,910
that's being sent to everyone all over 
the place.

4632
03:30:13,330 --> 03:30:14,500
You think you've got privacy.

4633
03:30:14,680 --> 03:30:18,070
Fuck you.
You can't even move to a Montana anymore

4634
03:30:18,071 --> 03:30:21,730
in a cabin and be off the grid,
which just doesn't happen.

4635
03:30:22,180 --> 03:30:23,230
So I love jesse.
Jesse,

4636
03:30:23,360 --> 03:30:24,440
jesse.
When it does,

4637
03:30:24,690 --> 03:30:26,600
I'm off the grid.
I,

4638
03:30:26,910 --> 03:30:31,910
I'm going to Mexico and I'm off the grid
and it's like he's got a show called off

4639
03:30:32,831 --> 03:30:33,611
the grid.
It's like,

4640
03:30:33,611 --> 03:30:34,150
well,
Yeah,

4641
03:30:34,150 --> 03:30:39,150
you're on the grid guy mma,
a fighter governor.

4642
03:30:39,910 --> 03:30:41,180
He's a.
Yeah,

4643
03:30:41,181 --> 03:30:43,370
he's off The grid,
but he's constantly on the grid.

4644
03:30:43,371 --> 03:30:45,600
There's no off the grid anymore.
There's no awkward.

4645
03:30:45,720 --> 03:30:47,150
The whole world's going to be on the 
grid.

4646
03:30:47,300 --> 03:30:48,470
Yeah,
the whole world.

4647
03:30:48,500 --> 03:30:49,333
That's what they're targeting.
Expand these satellite imagery things 

4648
03:30:51,771 --> 03:30:53,330
for uh,
for um,

4649
03:30:53,440 --> 03:30:54,273
the internet doing that as well.
Where are going To have satellite 

4650
03:30:56,781 --> 03:30:58,960
internet available everywhere all over 
the world,

4651
03:30:59,190 --> 03:31:01,190
all over the world.
And everybody up to speed.

4652
03:31:01,610 --> 03:31:04,070
And I was talking about this with 
somebody else.

4653
03:31:04,070 --> 03:31:08,000
Isn't it amazing that gps has worked for
as long as it has?

4654
03:31:08,001 --> 03:31:09,320
Yeah,
flawlessly.

4655
03:31:09,321 --> 03:31:10,154
It's amazing how good it was.
Never a problem inch by inch like 

4656
03:31:12,831 --> 03:31:15,420
literally tells you turn right.
And you're right there.

4657
03:31:16,060 --> 03:31:18,440
And I think we have the dumbed down 
version,

4658
03:31:18,441 --> 03:31:22,700
like the military has that,
the premium version like sure.

4659
03:31:22,730 --> 03:31:23,480
But yeah,
by the,

4660
03:31:23,480 --> 03:31:25,390
by the inch and we have,
you know,

4661
03:31:25,400 --> 03:31:26,233
buy a couple of feet.
But it's to me it's amazing that like 

4662
03:31:30,090 --> 03:31:32,460
it's worked this long.
It never goes out.

4663
03:31:32,470 --> 03:31:33,303
like oh,
it's really had it on cd rom and my car 

4664
03:31:36,291 --> 03:31:39,770
in 1998 styling.
Yeah.

4665
03:31:39,771 --> 03:31:40,604
I had the early version of of that and 
it was a big stupid thing that had to 

4666
03:31:44,761 --> 03:31:48,260
sit on top of the roof of my car to 
catch up to catch the satellite,

4667
03:31:48,380 --> 03:31:49,213
like a disc or like some,
some weird antenna that had to go up 

4668
03:31:52,011 --> 03:31:52,844
there.

4669
03:31:53,230 --> 03:31:55,640
They used to have to have to pick up 
the,

4670
03:31:55,641 --> 03:31:56,474
uh,
the gps and the satellites aren't any 

4671
03:31:57,981 --> 03:32:00,270
different,
but the receivers are like,

4672
03:32:00,290 --> 03:32:01,123
can be a lot smaller and fucking phones 
in your fucking things up while it's in 

4673
03:32:03,771 --> 03:32:04,604
your pocket.
They're tracking you while it's in your 

4674
03:32:05,871 --> 03:32:07,040
pocket,
in your car,

4675
03:32:07,041 --> 03:32:09,260
as you're driving course,
when it's off,

4676
03:32:09,290 --> 03:32:11,900
when it's,
I don't trust any of these electronics.

4677
03:32:11,990 --> 03:32:12,823
I use them.
I'm not going to throw my fucking phone 

4678
03:32:14,001 --> 03:32:15,950
away and,
and if I do forget it,

4679
03:32:15,951 --> 03:32:20,000
there's no board horrifying feeLing than
driving away from your house and go,

4680
03:32:20,330 --> 03:32:23,000
oh fuck,
I don't have my tracking device.

4681
03:32:23,360 --> 03:32:27,140
And you will turn around and get it 
because you can't function without it.

4682
03:32:27,230 --> 03:32:29,780
It's everything to people.
Again,

4683
03:32:29,781 --> 03:32:30,614
if,
if there was that emp or whatever the 

4684
03:32:32,241 --> 03:32:35,090
fuck it is,
that just zaps the grid,

4685
03:32:35,840 --> 03:32:39,620
you would say pandemonium in no time.

4686
03:32:39,860 --> 03:32:41,330
Well,
you would see pandemonium.

4687
03:32:41,331 --> 03:32:43,760
It was just the power grid went down for
any reason.

4688
03:32:43,761 --> 03:32:46,550
If someone like a terrorist attack took 
out the power grid,

4689
03:32:46,940 --> 03:32:49,460
we need power way more than we think we 
do.

4690
03:32:49,760 --> 03:32:50,620
Oh,
absolutely.

4691
03:32:50,920 --> 03:32:53,600
You think nothing of.
We in New York,

4692
03:32:53,601 --> 03:32:56,900
we had a hurricane a few years ago,
like five or six years ago,

4693
03:32:56,901 --> 03:32:59,630
I guess it was,
and I'm the one that took out jersey and

4694
03:32:59,631 --> 03:33:01,880
long island and stuff.
And uh,

4695
03:33:02,030 --> 03:33:06,680
we went nine days without power in the 
house on long island.

4696
03:33:07,190 --> 03:33:10,040
And you could see it fraying around the 
edges,

4697
03:33:10,041 --> 03:33:11,090
man.
Society,

4698
03:33:11,091 --> 03:33:11,924
just the first couple of days you'd be 
on online at the gas station of philip 

4699
03:33:15,530 --> 03:33:18,230
jerry cans to take back to your 
generators at the house.

4700
03:33:18,440 --> 03:33:19,151
And it's like,
oh,

4701
03:33:19,151 --> 03:33:20,060
okay.
Excuse me.

4702
03:33:20,120 --> 03:33:20,830
Oh no.
Oh,

4703
03:33:20,830 --> 03:33:23,900
you were first guy had got hit by that 
seventh,

4704
03:33:23,930 --> 03:33:26,180
eighth day.
It got,

4705
03:33:26,630 --> 03:33:27,230
fuck.

4706
03:33:27,230 --> 03:33:29,780
You know,
I was standing here.

4707
03:33:29,781 --> 03:33:32,120
Go fuck yourself.
Get to the back of the line now.

4708
03:33:32,121 --> 03:33:37,121
Could you imagine if that was you trying
to get your kids medication or something

4709
03:33:38,730 --> 03:33:39,563
or food like it just goes a little 
longer and now foods getting a little 

4710
03:33:42,751 --> 03:33:46,050
scarce,
you are going to have a problem and I am

4711
03:33:46,051 --> 03:33:49,950
stunned.
It hasn't happened to any extent.

4712
03:33:49,980 --> 03:33:50,940
Really.
We saw,

4713
03:33:51,210 --> 03:33:53,400
we saw close with katrina,
I think,

4714
03:33:53,930 --> 03:33:55,680
uh,
and violence started.

4715
03:33:55,710 --> 03:33:57,750
That was,
that was a little out of hand,

4716
03:33:57,930 --> 03:34:01,110
but use app that grid give people,
they have nothing.

4717
03:34:01,590 --> 03:34:05,790
I wound up getting a giant fucking,
like a cummings generator.

4718
03:34:06,030 --> 03:34:08,910
This thing like is for backup power at 
hospitals.

4719
03:34:09,780 --> 03:34:11,370
So when the power goes out in my 
neighborhood,

4720
03:34:11,640 --> 03:34:14,730
literally my pool is running flood 
lights in the backyard.

4721
03:34:14,790 --> 03:34:18,790
Every tv's on it comes on automatically.
It just sit there as if fuel with,

4722
03:34:18,860 --> 03:34:21,090
eh,
it's a liquid propane,

4723
03:34:21,610 --> 03:34:26,280
but I have to 1000 gallon tanks buried 
in my front yard.

4724
03:34:26,820 --> 03:34:28,170
What?
So it would,

4725
03:34:28,200 --> 03:34:30,580
it would,
it would last for a long fucking time.

4726
03:34:30,590 --> 03:34:32,490
Lungs in time.
Uh,

4727
03:34:32,680 --> 03:34:34,590
uh,
depending on how much you use because,

4728
03:34:34,591 --> 03:34:35,220
uh,
the more,

4729
03:34:35,220 --> 03:34:37,050
uh,
the more draw on it,

4730
03:34:37,230 --> 03:34:38,063
the heart of the engine's got to work.
So it depends if I'm running my whole 

4731
03:34:40,861 --> 03:34:41,820
house,
I don't know,

4732
03:34:41,880 --> 03:34:42,713
it would last a few weeks and it's safe 
to that propane to be in those cans on 

4733
03:34:47,780 --> 03:34:49,150
underground?
No,

4734
03:34:49,240 --> 03:34:50,073
they're a giant tax.
They're running natural gas into my 

4735
03:34:53,460 --> 03:34:56,430
neighborhood so I might have a converted
over to natural gas.

4736
03:34:56,431 --> 03:34:59,040
But I like the fact that if the gas 
breaks too,

4737
03:34:59,400 --> 03:35:03,660
I can still at least jacka an lp truck 
somewhere and fill up my own tank.

4738
03:35:03,661 --> 03:35:05,790
You know,
crazy push came to shove,

4739
03:35:05,910 --> 03:35:10,050
but it is just every light in the house 
can be on my neighborhood's dark.

4740
03:35:10,290 --> 03:35:13,890
I'm just looking at it like an half 
fuckers that happened.

4741
03:35:14,190 --> 03:35:14,701
A.
Yeah.

4742
03:35:14,701 --> 03:35:15,810
Yeah.
A few times.

4743
03:35:15,880 --> 03:35:16,713
I'm waiting for a big one though.
Like I really want to be bad blackout 

4744
03:35:20,070 --> 03:35:20,903
just so I can dig it and know that 
you're the guy with the power that say 

4745
03:35:22,951 --> 03:35:24,780
the guy with refrigerants where the guns
come in.

4746
03:35:26,960 --> 03:35:30,750
like it really is it.
There is something a little creepy about

4747
03:35:30,751 --> 03:35:35,751
the pRospect that we are really 
delicately balanced as a society.

4748
03:35:36,360 --> 03:35:41,360
It could really fly apart.
We truSt too much that the power is just

4749
03:35:41,571 --> 03:35:42,404
going beyond thAt the water's gonna run 
that the food's going to be at the 

4750
03:35:44,491 --> 03:35:45,324
supermarket or whatever the fuck it is.
like you got a great advantage being 

4751
03:35:48,451 --> 03:35:51,170
able to hunt.
They get how many people don't know.

4752
03:35:51,300 --> 03:35:54,090
Do you know what american refugees would
look like?

4753
03:35:54,390 --> 03:35:55,223
The fat fucking mess.
Crossing some border to Canada to be 

4754
03:35:58,441 --> 03:36:01,020
saved from some cataclysm that happened 
down here.

4755
03:36:01,230 --> 03:36:02,580
What?
A bunch of fucking.

4756
03:36:02,760 --> 03:36:06,150
Just weak soft.
No nothing.

4757
03:36:06,600 --> 03:36:09,120
Every convenience they've used for 
years.

4758
03:36:09,330 --> 03:36:13,650
Just not trained in the feeding yourself
outside in the wild.

4759
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:15,780
They have no idea.
You ever skin an animal?

4760
03:36:15,960 --> 03:36:16,793
You ever kill something to eat a do?
Do you know how to get water from just 

4761
03:36:20,611 --> 03:36:21,444
the humidity in the air or there are 
things that we just don't know because 

4762
03:36:24,361 --> 03:36:25,194
we depend on technology and we trust 
that it's always going to be there 

4763
03:36:29,160 --> 03:36:30,000
because it has been.

4764
03:36:30,000 --> 03:36:30,833
I mean,
you know,

4765
03:36:31,060 --> 03:36:34,650
we get very complacent,
but that's why if it ever failed,

4766
03:36:34,710 --> 03:36:39,130
whoa,
fuck you better hunker down somewhere.

4767
03:36:39,720 --> 03:36:40,740
It's crazy.
Indeed.

4768
03:36:40,810 --> 03:36:41,643
And on that note,
do we just did like four hours on it 

4769
03:36:44,921 --> 03:36:47,110
seems like it flew right by.
Did floor.

4770
03:36:47,170 --> 03:36:48,910
That is nuts,
joe.

4771
03:36:48,911 --> 03:36:50,080
I gotta.
Thank you man.

4772
03:36:50,200 --> 03:36:52,720
Thank you.
I love being on your show for real.

4773
03:36:52,721 --> 03:36:55,390
You're the reason why this all happened.
It's crazy now.

4774
03:36:55,391 --> 03:36:57,200
People know it's fucking nuts.
I,

4775
03:36:57,201 --> 03:37:00,670
I love it.
I love always good seeing my friend very

4776
03:37:00,671 --> 03:37:01,390
much.
Cool.

4777
03:37:01,390 --> 03:37:02,590
Oh,
the gentleman.

4778
03:37:02,680 --> 03:37:03,513
Yeah.
He's got a book out permanently 

4779
03:37:04,391 --> 03:37:05,500
suspended.
Available,

4780
03:37:05,501 --> 03:37:06,334
uh,
anywhere.

4781
03:37:06,400 --> 03:37:08,740
Go to compound media.com
for all the details.

4782
03:37:08,830 --> 03:37:09,663
All right.

4783
03:37:12,380 --> 03:37:14,530
Oh yeah.
Awesome.
