1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,600
Any of this stuff and how do you know?
I mean it's a.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,850
you're talking about retroviruses.
That's an incredibly intense subject to 

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:11,430
be researching.
There's a lot involved and understanding

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:16,431
it.
So understandably people rely on folks 

5
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:20,550
like you.
We rely on someone who has done the work

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,850
and is a,
is a professor and when we hear a guy 

7
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,680
like you saying that HIV doesn't cause 
aids,

8
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:30,690
that's like,
it's very confusing.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,920
There's,
I'm sure your life is filled with 

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:35,920
controversy.
I mean,

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,270
what,
what is an average day like for you as 

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:40,270
far as like hate mail?
Do you get a lot of hate mail?

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,690
Get a lot of me,
but he does actually minority really?

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,740
There's a lot of guys saying.
She said all of a suspected something is

15
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:50,950
or can you tell me?
Can you explain me?

16
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,610
What should I do?
Should I take anti bio tugs?

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,800
I feel horrible and I give them answers.
My answers not going to tell him why I 

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,790
give these senses.
It's not just

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,310
no.
For people who don't understand your,

20
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:08,730
your argument.
I mean in a,

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,760
in a,
in a paraphrasing sort of way is that 

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:13,760
these,
it's,

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,650
it's illicit drug use,
it's like a email nitrate and crystal 

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,791
meth and that is what's destroying the 
immune systems of these people and then 

25
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,740
HIV shows up because their immune system
is diminished.

26
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:25,580
Is that a fair assessment,

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,320
diminished or not?
It is just the chance that you might be 

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,880
positive or not.
It's like with all my copd,

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,350
you know,
you can catch it or not,

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,800
but of course if you are what they used 
to be at least in first line of aids 

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,090
patients,
the gay person,

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,660
gay guys a day had hunters have in,
in,

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,670
in the gay liberation days,
hundreds of dates and so that's like 

34
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,850
Mike Michael Collection.
If you could detect or get in contact,

35
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,930
any mid contract,
whatever,

36
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:03,931
contact with lots of people,
you pick up what's available on the 

37
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,991
market [inaudible] you see,
and that's where my Kolbe collectors,

38
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,080
so they had this Michael,
but it hit all others tools.

39
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,130
They had hepatitis B bows and they had 
to immediately and so HIV is a virus is 

40
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,270
a virus,
is it?

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,020
It's one of the most harmless type of 
fibrosis would be no,

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,510
that's why we only discovered them 
really well in the lab or worked in them

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,270
in the last 10 years.

44
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,010
So how could it be possible that no one 
else believes this,

45
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,630
that the scientific community sort of 
looks down on,

46
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,040
on your,
your assessment of this and,

47
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,620
and,
and what,

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,700
what is your,
what's the argument?

49
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,210
Daddy's.
I think much politics behind it.

50
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:48,360
You see the was hunters is we used to be
called,

51
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,390
still called those who are looking for 
viruses doing something or another they,

52
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,970
they apply this to find something to get
the for,

53
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,320
to do something.
If they do something bad then they're 

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,560
important.
You know what I mean?

55
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,540
So if they,
if they are harmless,

56
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,530
they are not so important.
Same.

57
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,550
Okay.
You study your harmless is telling me 

58
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,580
what else is happening here.
So then we tried that in the sixties and

59
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:17,581
fifties.
It was popular then seventies that this 

60
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:19,330
might cause cancer.
You may have heard about this,

61
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,370
but it was cancer poke come,
but it was Kansas Coe and we tried very 

62
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,591
hard.
This is why I came to this country from 

63
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:28,591
Germany.
Yeah,

64
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:28,591
that was a hot item.
Said,

65
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:28,960
okay.
We find that

66
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,580
as an example,
I'm a human papilloma virus can turn 

67
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:34,580
into cervical cancer,
right?

68
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,011
I mean you can catch a virus,
something one type or the theory goes 

69
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:39,310
and then if you.
If left unchecked,

70
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,390
it grows into cervical cancer as an 
example.

71
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:42,920
Right?
Is that what you're talking about?

72
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,660
What they clean,
but what it really does,

73
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:49,661
it makes a word.
It's why it's called Papilloma is 

74
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:53,350
another word for word.
What to say,

75
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,090
what did.
Maybe 30 years later you get cancer when

76
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:59,250
they come in with a long lead in period,
you can already something.

77
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,540
Something is.
It doesn't.

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,570
It doesn't add up.
Why was this not slow?

79
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,750
They are not that complicated.
They infect you.

80
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:11,930
Now all they want to do is replicating 
what they produce their own.

81
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,810
They don't wait 10 or 20 years for 
something to happen.

82
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,180
There was.
Wouldn't you admit though,

83
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:17,720
if you look in.

84
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,730
I,
I watched a lot of people die in the 

85
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,750
eighties in New York and,
and a number of them were gay,

86
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,030
but from Wiki,
yes,

87
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:28,820
that was the first still lift,
the made sure,

88
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,570
sure.
But,

89
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:31,760
but here's,
here's what was interesting is that most

90
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:36,650
of them were dying from it from very 
similar symptoms if you went there,

91
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,150
in fact,
majority of aids,

92
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,770
and you can correct me where I'm wrong 
here,

93
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:42,890
but the majority of aids patients die of
starvation.

94
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,360
A,
it's very difficult for them to hold 

95
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,360
food,
to retain food.

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,550
That was really when you went to the 
wards and I did,

97
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,550
you'd see all these aids patients and 
they were terribly skinny.

98
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,890
And actually what happened was,
yes,

99
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:55,700
the virus would,
uh,

100
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,840
would destroy your immune system and 
you'd be exposed to you to get car 

101
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:00,860
pullman car,
Posey Sarcoma,

102
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:05,861
which was a big,
these rare skin cancers that only old 

103
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,410
people get an all kinds of awful 
diseases.

104
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,410
I mean,
I watched people with these terrible 

105
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:11,410
rashes.
They didn't know what.

106
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:11,480
You're not a doctor.
I'm not a doctor at all.

107
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,740
I'm just an actor,
man.

108
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:13,650
I don't know.
I know nothing.

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
I was just,
Oh yeah,

110
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:15,770
yeah.
Well,

111
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:18,120
I've read a lot of innovation over.
You said you went to.

112
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Yeah,
I've read a lot about it and correct me 

113
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:23,720
by the way.
I'm a layman so,

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,810
but,
but I,

115
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,460
I'm,
I'm just,

116
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,820
I'm going to get to a question.
It's not a,

117
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,120
it's not a point of view,
it's a question,

118
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,710
but I'm.
One of the things that,

119
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,740
that,
that there was clearly in their 

120
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:35,740
bloodstream,
when you get tested for what they'd call

121
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,000
HIV,
they're not seeing the virus.

122
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:43,001
What you get tested for and what shows 
up on your test is antibodies to the 

123
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:43,001
virus.
Right?

124
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,050
Very important point.
Right?

125
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,300
You know,
it's just as opposite as you could get 

126
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,660
other files antibody against it.
Neutralizing and stopping.

127
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:51,530
And Kenny.
Exactly.

128
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,830
That is a vaccine that is nature's and 
men's.

129
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,190
Mankind's only protection against 
violence is a vaccine

130
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,760
for yourself or induced by somebody.
However though,

131
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,030
yes,
the body mounts a defense with 

132
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,030
antibiotics.
What,

133
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,420
what the theory,
and I,

134
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,520
and I'll just add to this what the 
theory was that what happens is it's 

135
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,701
such an onslaught on your immune system.
The immune system eventually gives up 

136
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:17,540
and cannot produce enough antibodies.
Your immune system gets killed.

137
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,480
Along comes David Ho with you and I know
you know the name Dr.

138
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,820
That's right.
And Yeah Man of the year times man was 

139
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,350
also middle of the year,
but the devil's in the 30 to a Nazi.

140
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,180
But,
but,

141
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,960
but,
but,

142
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,460
but,
but having said that doctor,

143
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,520
there are a lot of people that took 
protease inhibitors and I know him and 

144
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,950
by the way,
when they were dying,

145
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,830
they sold all their stuff because they 
were going to be gone in a month.

146
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,130
And Lo and behold,
proteosome inhibitor is keep people 

147
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:48,130
alive.

148
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,090
I mean I've seen this.
So the question becomes if protease 

149
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,081
inhibitors,
which by the way now you still have to 

150
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:56,081
use to have to take,
as you know,

151
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,750
a bunch of pills.
Now it's down to four or five pills a 

152
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,061
day.
There are a lot of people living with 

153
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:04,151
HIV that the argument goes and I,
at least from what I've seen would have 

154
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:07,850
been dead and now are living very normal
lives and how do you explain that?

155
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,270
That's what they obviously play,
but look at the people who don't take 

156
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,350
these tugs.
World Health Organization,

157
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,380
the Centers for disease control say $35,
million of them at least on this planet.

158
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,530
Probably even more.
This is 30 percent of the African in 

159
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:26,530
America.
We have a million.

160
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,060
These million,
that million in American HIV positive 

161
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,800
was there in 85 is still here.
Why didn't they die?

162
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:34,640
Or they did that though.

163
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,610
A lot of people died in the ACF.
Still a million.

164
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,320
He the numbers the same as it 
originally.

165
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,760
Any million Americans.
Yes,

166
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:46,310
there would be certain years later it 
wouldn't be the same rule yet,

167
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,340
but there will be replaced in part.
Well isn't that because people were 

168
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,840
catching it more and more.
I mean you,

169
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:52,440
you.
In other words,

170
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,460
you had it already in in 85 when it 
bites mission 1 million were positive.

171
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,020
Now still a million and of the 30 or $40
million who never get to live exactly 

172
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,070
like they did before.
Take Africa,

173
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,340
Africa is it 30 percent are positive and
the continent would die out.

174
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,590
Remember that.
Guess what happened?

175
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,800
It was poor or 500 million Africans in 
the eighties when it ended up the ads,

176
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:24,500
when they first detected in the guess 
how many we have now,

177
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,220
like Africans,
I dunno,

178
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,050
1 billion still.
One third of them are HIV positive.

179
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,400
They almost tripled.
That is the largest population explosion

180
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:36,740
in the history.
The history of mankind,

181
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,970
despite each oem there of died away and 
that's what they still see in the New 

182
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,970
York Times on the journalists.
They don't want to hear about it that 

183
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:48,970
you say they're doubling and tripling.
You see,

184
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,560
if you look for populations,
it's not the same article.

185
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,220
Occasionally they may get a little note,
so protease inhibitors do not

186
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,120
work or they they are a fake drug or 
what do they do that's positive?

187
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,770
That's helping these people improve 
their health conditions.

188
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,810
Anything.
Nothing name possibly.

189
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,970
It gets them into a new lifestyle.
I think.

190
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:13,971
You don't feel like having 10 days or 
five dates when you're on protease 

191
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,560
inhibitors.
Many of them show up and feel so it.

192
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,070
I Dunno how it balances off.
What about if you look at some of the 

193
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,040
pictures now?
They con admitted in the Congo,

194
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,800
in the San Francisco Chronicle.
It was.

195
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:30,801
I have several references here.
Should get them out and show me they 

196
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:33,330
they age very quickly.
They have liver disease,

197
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,390
they have heart disease,
kidney disease and the side effects or 

198
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:38,910
what are toxic side effects is a 
euphemism.

199
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,330
That's the only effective deaths.
HIV positive,

200
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,510
not no trucks.
Anything you want to do is fine,

201
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,250
but.
But the the.

202
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,320
We have to go back for a second.
The fact remains that in the eighties 

203
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,131
and nineties I knew a lot of people,
a lot of gay men who were dying and I 

204
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:59,080
watched them die very specifically.
They were dying with,

205
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:00,700
with,
with blue splotches.

206
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,260
They were dying because they couldn't 
hold down food.

207
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,180
They were dying.
No,

208
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,190
very slow.
Ammonia ammonia a great deal in the 

209
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,190
money.
I watched this W,

210
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,390
we all saw it,
and what happened was all of us said,

211
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:15,391
wait a minute,
this is something crazy is going on 

212
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:15,391
here.
You could see it.

213
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:16,990
It was just droves of walking dead in in
New York.

214
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:21,991
It was such a tragic thing.
You don't see that anymore in the gay 

215
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:25,441
community,
and all of them that I know are taking 

216
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,910
these drugs that seem to be wonder drugs
because what they've done is kept people

217
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:32,080
alive and healthy and muscular and 
vibrant.

218
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,600
You just don't.
In the gay community,

219
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,600
the AIDS HIV is no longer a death 
sentence.

220
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:38,860
In fact,
HIV is,

221
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,960
isn't even something they talk about as 
much.

222
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,100
And,
and so the fact remains that you don't 

223
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,610
have an epidemic of death in the gay 
community as you did in 85,

224
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,930
91,
92.

225
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,630
And until David who came along with 
protease inhibitors.

226
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,180
So you,
something happened there.

227
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,710
Something had to have happened there.
I mean,

228
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,750
don't,
wouldn't you agree?

229
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:03,751
I mean,
you don't see people with Kaposi's 

230
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:03,751
sarcoma.
Hospital wars are not full of people who

231
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:05,030
can't hold food down and dying in 
ammonia,

232
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,380
uh,
who are HIV positive,

233
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,160
right?
So,

234
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,480
so how do we explain that?

235
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,800
It was at least according to the records
that I found in the light up yourself.

236
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,230
Mike callen for example,
you may know that,

237
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,690
sure,
that's my dad's name,

238
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:24,691
but it's a different Michael Gannon,
he says 1500 dates and with two or three

239
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:30,211
or four nights sometimes with nitride 
inhalants and Philomena and cocaine and 

240
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,580
all of these talks up when you can,
if you burn the candle on so many ends 

241
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,160
that he was gone in five or 10 years 
later.

242
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,430
That's what gets them sick.
Now,

243
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,460
at least many of them know,
at least suspect that nitrite inhalants,

244
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,340
the poppers causing cap,
Posey and wearing them out.

245
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,620
That is known

246
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,080
poppers.
So poppers are what caused Kaposi 

247
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Sarcoma.
Vague,

248
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,600
vague.
Many number of studies have directly 

249
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:02,890
shown.
The coalition is a carcinogen.

250
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,920
It's a nighttime is in an isolating 
ancient that goes through the blood and 

251
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,590
causes the.
Essentially it's a skin blood cancer.

252
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,360
Brian,
where you're with your friends,

253
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:15,500
drug users?
No,

254
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,710
not all of them.
I mean the ones who know,

255
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,690
a lot of them were just theater guys.
In fact,

256
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:22,780
in fact a lot of them were theater guys 
who were just gay.

257
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,460
I mean there are a lot of examples of 
people who were not drug users.

258
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,030
I mean,
my God,

259
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,031
there are a lot of children that 
database because they got it from their 

260
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:35,071
parents or from blood transfusions.
They've new boil in the eighties,

261
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:40,201
there were all of them.
The kids have junkie mothers who had 

262
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:44,720
lost intuit's in junkies maybe,
but the fact of the matter is they 

263
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:44,720
weren't using drugs.

264
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:44,720
They,
they,

265
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,810
I guess the blood was passed onto them,
right?

266
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,750
Virus.
He ate the question of act now.

267
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:54,751
Act is what they gave them initially.
That was what they gave them when they 

268
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:56,470
first started.
80 seven now act correctly,

269
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:01,530
me if I'm wrong,
was a cancer medication that was deemed 

270
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,630
to be too dangerous.
Who?

271
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:07,710
They used it for chemotherapy and they 
stopped using it because it was killing 

272
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,350
people.
Like in the cancer.

273
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,840
They still use it somewhat.
Also for chemotherapy.

274
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,260
It's not different from any other 
chemotherapy,

275
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,190
but it's a very,
very brutal one.

276
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,020
The old potent,
they're all brutal.

277
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,500
They're designed to be pulled.
They're designed to kill human cells.

278
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,370
Yeah,
because it's a retrovirus.

279
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,340
Retrovirus.
Human Cells,

280
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,470
human cells,
chemotherapy,

281
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,210
cancer cooks.
He signed to kill human cells and that's

282
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:36,211
what they give him.
They give him less and less so they tie 

283
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:37,600
act on the idea though,
behind killing,

284
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,820
killing human cells,
especially in new cells.

285
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,050
The idea that because the cancer,
because these are retroviruses,

286
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:49,051
retrovirus is defined as something that 
creates its own rna that copies the DNA 

287
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:49,420
of the cell.
It's invading,

288
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:50,620
right?
So in other words,

289
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,170
it mimics.
It creates a clone of itself.

290
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,720
It's actually someone you any,
any,

291
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,910
any viruses do that,
but isn't that what a retroviruses.

292
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,690
Isn't that how you would define a there 
to convert it to a Dni in back to one?

293
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Exactly,
but that it creates almost a clone of 

294
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:08,760
itself.
So when you create a medicine that kills

295
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,100
the virus,
you're also gonna.

296
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,160
You're also creating a medicine that's 
going to kill the actual classes that 

297
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,160
resemble computer viruses and computer 
viruses in biological viruses.

298
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:21,670
At a certain point in time,
when you look at that,

299
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,130
the fact that it copies the host.
Yeah.

300
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,580
What the fuck is that?
That's an invasion of code.

301
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,240
It's amazing.
Viruses,

302
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,810
a terrifying,
terrifying,

303
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:36,811
but what we've learned a lot,
I'd seems from these different viruses 

304
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:36,880
and how they react,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

305
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:38,800
I know you don't believe in protease 
inhibitors,

306
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:41,710
but literature like I believe that your 
work,

307
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,450
but I do deliver and they screw up your 
metabolism.

308
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,410
They're not quite as toxic as act or the
DNA chain terminator,

309
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,890
but now

310
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,260
all of the treatments,
antiviral treatments or cocktails of DNA

311
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,420
chain,
terminator and protease inhibitors,

312
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,030
so you get many ways.
So Dr.

313
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,120
if somebody had HIV and guess what?
The people who take those eventually die

314
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:10,910
form and it's not so rare they die 10,
20 years later,

315
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,100
the doses so that they won't die 
immediately.

316
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:15,770
I think that would be bad even for the 
farmer,

317
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,610
but isn't.
Isn't that better than isn't dying 20 

318
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,801
years later,
better than dying six months later as 

319
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:23,801
HIV did that,
that would be better,

320
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:25,100
but it's not.
Was Not HIV.

321
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,350
There are millions with HIV,
you have nothing.

322
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,690
They exploding in Africa,
the population,

323
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,980
there are million Americans is still 
around half million.

324
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,070
Still around no treatment.
That's the only way to go.

325
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,600
Most Americans that are HIV positive,
I believe or are getting treatment here.

326
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,930
I mean the ones that I know,
I know only three,

327
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,160
but I know they're getting that.

328
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,880
That's not a lot,
but I do know three.

329
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,930
Your HIV positive.
One is a woman in her sixties.

330
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,730
They will be in that.
Cool.

331
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,300
They will get.
Guess what they usually die from?

332
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,700
These guys are longterm treatment.
Toxicity.

333
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,990
Will it die from pneumonia,
from lung disease,

334
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,590
kidney disease and heart disease though,
and then they get dementia.

335
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,620
They get the chemo plane.
If you have these chain terminators 

336
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,220
working your mitochondria,
you become more and more senile.

337
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,880
Very early.
It is described now in the San Francisco

338
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:19,400
Chronicle just a week ago.
They have this AIDS institute.

339
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,050
They're there for the first time.
Let it,

340
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:24,410
so maybe it's that talks to his.
Everything is.

341
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:29,411
There's no question.
There's no question that drugs caused 

342
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:29,411
these drugs are caused.
That was.

343
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:32,840
That was ignoring half of these eight 
patients,

344
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,920
so-called HIV AIDS patients or HIV 
patients are dying from all of the.

345
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:41,360
We have a huge list of so called AIDS 
defining diseases.

346
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,400
Twenty seven.
That's not enough.

347
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,710
With those talks you cause heart 
disease,

348
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,300
lung disease,
pneumonia,

349
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,520
kidney disease.
That's what they die from.

350
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,130
Over half of a death certificate.
Now,

351
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,830
when did I.
These used to die.

352
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,210
They used to die from it very quickly 
and I saw it by the droves.

353
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,470
Look,
the the theater community in New York 

354
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,470
for example,
there is a disconnect.

355
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,710
There's something wrong if they were 
dying by the droves and all the sudden 

356
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,540
they got on these protease inhibitors 
and the whole community became healthy.

357
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,780
So you're saying it was like a placebo 
effect for the entire community or the 

358
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,430
whole community changed its life?
Stage to life.

359
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,670
Is that what happened to the truck cues?
The recreational drug use went down 

360
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,140
somewhat.
I don't know where it's now,

361
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,960
but it was word of mouth that this was 
probably part of the department.

362
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,000
I mean,
Michael Calendar,

363
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,480
these guys guided themselves.
They say this lifestyle is untenable.

364
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,280
It's unquestionable.
I mean,

365
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,430
there's no question that it is a part of
the problem.

366
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:49,740
Everybody who does like hardcore drugs 
like that,

367
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,900
it fucks your body.
Shadow it.

368
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,110
Hardcore drugs also create promiscuity.
When you're doing math,

369
00:17:55,111 --> 00:18:00,111
you're fucking.
You're a guy without the guys doing 

370
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:00,111
what's going on.
Nothing.

371
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:03,940
I'm just saying it's nothing new.
Three billion years old.

372
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,320
You can when you see.
Have you ever seen me have sex?

373
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:12,321
It's new.
It looks very original approach to 

374
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:16,520
select interpretive dance because I 
subscribed to on it and I applied there.

375
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,470
Their sex swings and drinks.
That chocolate shake.

376
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,340
He goes nutty.
Dude.

377
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:21,760
I had that.
Had that hemp proteins.

378
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:22,710
Awesome.
Oh my God.

379
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:24,950
That chocolate.
It's amazing.

380
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,280
Amazing.
That's really,

381
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:26,760
really good.

382
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,430
So,
so what happened to these people?

383
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,930
There's,
there's gotta be an explanation.

384
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,150
These people are sick.
They take the protease inhibitors,

385
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,260
the.
They're healthy,

386
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:42,261
they live.
But you're saying protease inhibitors 

387
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:44,061
actually are toxic and very bad for the 
body to change terminators,

388
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,960
right?
So how are they getting better?

389
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,290
They don't get better.
Where's the evidence that they get 

390
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,261
better?
You don't get worse as much as they did 

391
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:57,261
before.
It's fast.

392
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,440
Did it before.
I don't know it.

393
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,690
They acknowledged it.
They never cured anybody with these 

394
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:03,690
folks.
Never any cure.

395
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,020
It's not cure.
It's exactly like diabetes.

396
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,660
You control,
you control the viral load.

397
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,200
And what they do is that it used to be 
in the viral load would be huge.

398
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,120
And when you take the,
the,

399
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,720
the,
uh,

400
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,250
the proteus neighbors,
et Cetera,

401
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,430
the cocktail,
it reduces the viral load to two levels 

402
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,470
where your immune system does not have 
to work to get rid of it.

403
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,090
It,
it.

404
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,860
Because what it does,
it creates a teflon sort of coding right

405
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:31,950
on the helper t cell and the virus 
cannot latch on.

406
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,550
Now what happens according to what I 
read in scientific American,

407
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,820
is the virus eventually starts to 
disguise itself and the cell no longer 

408
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:45,030
puts that teflon coating on and it can 
finally latch on.

409
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,370
But I,
you know,

410
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,880
this is what I read.
You have a different,

411
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,280
what have you been in?
Your name is pine.

412
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,910
Yes.
Yes.

413
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,050
So actor Brian,
not Dr.

414
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,260
No.
You'll record those tapes on the 

415
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,260
establishment very well.
Yes.

416
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,000
But the reality is,
you said yourself 10,

417
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,130
15 minutes ago.
What you find in AIDS patients,

418
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,630
even those dying from it is not the only
antibody against it.

419
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,370
Dividable slowed is a new term in the 
new invention of the establishment to 

420
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,280
make it sound horrible.
What isn't probably what you can even be

421
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,140
found.
It cannot be found.

422
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,160
So what they use is they is the so 
called preliminary chain reaction if you

423
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:21,430
heard about that.
Okay.

424
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,880
Molly's is the inventor of it lifts down
here.

425
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,830
Not far from the.
Also questions,

426
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,020
HIV,
AIDS lobby.

427
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,800
Nobody's there also.
Does acid

428
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,880
do just a little bit too?
Yes.

429
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,440
Yes.
Okay.

430
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,700
Molly's is not your mainstream everage 
scientists like to meet that dude.

431
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,500
He's a free.
You can get him up here.

432
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,630
Come up here is in Newport beach.
Dr.

433
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,630
How did you come up with,
how did you arrive at this conclusion?

434
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,020
Uh,
as,

435
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,570
as,
as a molecular biologist,

436
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:55,750
somebody who deals with chemistry and 
how it reacts in the body.

437
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,790
What was the,
what was the turning point for you?

438
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,690
You know,
you have all this science,

439
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:06,691
all these scientists saying one thing.
You came along and said another and 

440
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:07,600
continue to say another,
you know,

441
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,760
what was it?
What was the,

442
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,000
what was the,
where was the Eureka moment for you?

443
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,960
Where as soon as I sell the papers from 
Gallo published,

444
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,190
I knew that was,
that he was politics.

445
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,430
Well,
Gallo was painted as a really nefarious 

446
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:26,430
character and a couple of things I've 
seen,

447
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,270
but I mean the evidence was already in 
debt.

448
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,120
All he felt was antibodies,
not virus.

449
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,070
Yeah.
For you guys have a gala was at decided,

450
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:34,330
is that nih?
Correct me if I'm wrong,

451
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,140
besides an ai to actually isolated what 
you would call the aids virus.

452
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:42,080
The acquired immune immunity deficiency 
virus as he named the.

453
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:43,690
Yeah,
a syndrome I guess.

454
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:44,410
Yeah.
So,

455
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,350
so anyway,
so that was.

456
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:47,440
Well,
it's not to be found.

457
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,710
He had a hell of a time finding it.
You may remember the scandal that he 

458
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,930
didn't find it,
so he took credit for it when the French

459
00:21:55,931 --> 00:22:00,931
actually isolated it.
So if you have violence with the high 

460
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:04,411
note and killing people,
all you need is picking needle and you 

461
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:08,461
have to.
This biosis can only hurt you if they 

462
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:13,200
are biochemically active candidates.
Elton now there in large numbers when 

463
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,130
they are latent,
neutralized by antibody,

464
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,500
no action,
nothing happens biochemically.

465
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,450
That was my starting point.

466
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,660
That is the situation after you 
neutralize the virus,

467
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,000
if that were a cause of disease,
all of us vaccinated to polio would limp

468
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,200
it out and have.
Well no,

469
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:31,740
because polio is a dead virus.
No,

470
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:36,741
no.
They're all the same doll debt unless 

471
00:22:36,741 --> 00:22:36,741
the.
Until they get to a sale,

472
00:22:36,741 --> 00:22:41,230
so that neutralized viruses.
We all have herpes.

473
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:43,630
We all have measles,
mumps.

474
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:46,360
We have often hepatitis.
Once it's over,

475
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,970
it's over.
Sometimes it comes back.

476
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,460
That's very rare.
That's why we all sitting around king.

477
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,390
Otherwise the microbes would have all 
killed time ago.

478
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,550
Sure.
And here we see HIV.

479
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,140
It was a new virus.
We tried well,

480
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,100
but isn't the,
oh,

481
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,980
that's almost the argument with HIV,
what would happen was your,

482
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,200
because we're always exposed to 
pathogens and different viral viral 

483
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,660
viruses.
Your immune system is always working to 

484
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:12,660
fight those things and does a very good 
job of it.

485
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,740
You get the immunity immunity,
uh,

486
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:19,741
acquired a deficiency syndrome.
You get a virus that attacks directly 

487
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:23,620
the immune system.
Now that's why you be young.

488
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:27,910
Men were getting very rare cancers that 
only old men get from the Mediterranean.

489
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,150
Why young men were getting pneumonia.
Yeah,

490
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,180
why young men were getting pneumonia,
why young men were getting a meningitis 

491
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,950
of the brain is weird.
Those young men who are getting it,

492
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,980
we're doing dozens of talks at once.
You can even delete the cdcs 

493
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,370
self-reported gate,
let's scope analysis.

494
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,640
They deport dozens of talks and there is
not one in any of these statistics that 

495
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:55,190
they published faithfully until 84.
When the vowels came.

496
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,480
Of course,
we changed overnight.

497
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,870
It was from Republican to Democrat or 
calculate to Protestant.

498
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,290
No more mention it.
There wasn't one in any of these 

499
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,410
statistics,
not even one who didn't do any thoughts.

500
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:11,490
They all went in and Michael Calvin and 
all these guys who are into business or 

501
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,680
law,
it's in all of course.

502
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,980
I'm the publisher of term then in New 
York,

503
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:23,090
so when you're blaming then you're a 
computing across maternity or you're 

504
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,960
contributing.
I don't mind.

505
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,340
No,
but he doesn't want to offend dates.

506
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,150
You're attributing the mortality rate 
that the.

507
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,340
The high mortality of,
of,

508
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:34,920
of,
of,

509
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:40,550
of death that for people who are HIV 
positive to actually the amount of drugs

510
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:46,101
they do.
Yes and not the only and only six and 

511
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:50,680
not the violence,
no sex advice column is acuity and 

512
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,310
everything is.
How is it possible.

513
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,440
It wasn't possible to do.
I have so many dates because we didn't 

514
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,501
have those trucks like in the Olympics 
we played the records or into bicycling 

515
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:01,920
with talks.
The same thing in the bedrooms to talks.

516
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:06,930
We know the way the route 5,200
years ago now you can buy them on the 

517
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,740
straight Viagara when you can work with 
phentermine and cocaine,

518
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,900
but icon all combined and you've got a 
connection here.

519
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,820
Ornette,
none of this podcast.

520
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That's the party that needed.
You're a doctor.

521
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:22,460
If I,
if I,

522
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,470
so if I have HIV,
but it really does make sense that gay 

523
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:33,801
dudes with party that hard though,
if you think about the fact there's no 

524
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:33,801
chicks down there was slow down to fond 
and get knocked out,

525
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,810
but man,
it's just crazy bro.

526
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,020
Cocks and holes who just blow it off as 
many times a day as you can and doing 

527
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,650
whatever drugs you're friends have.
Well they did.

528
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:44,220
Do,
you know,

529
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:49,221
they did do a study on the average HIV 
positive guy in the eighties and he did 

530
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:51,250
have literally a hundred and 50 
partners.

531
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,550
Like think about,
you know,

532
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,940
when you were a young man,
just one weekend in Vegas.

533
00:25:56,941 --> 00:26:00,630
What it would do for your body.
Now imagine if you lived on Santa Monica

534
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,690
Boulevard and you were 36 and you would 
just do a meth every night.

535
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,850
Cloud,
you know the like,

536
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,230
really,
please don't say plowed.

537
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,350
It would devastate your fucking t cell 
size.

538
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,430
God,
I wish I was gay.

539
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,320
He says,
okay,

540
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,040
now.
Okay.

541
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,670
Here's the big question though.
Of course,

542
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:25,671
obviously.
How is it possible that every other 

543
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:25,671
scientists,
not every other.

544
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:25,671
There's a few others that believe in 
you.

545
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,550
A question.
The things that we might kary mullis for

546
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,490
independence and there's a few open.
Many of them cannot.

547
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,140
Is that what are the what the case is?
It's just an unbelievably controversial 

548
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,140
opinion.
You can't say it.

549
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,270
Look at,
I have.

550
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,610
I have no more catches students.
I never get a count in 15,

551
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:49,750
20 years.
Since I questioned each job.

552
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,100
I had everything.
I had a lab full of graduate students.

553
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:55,050
I got every kind I was supplied.
Boy,

554
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,620
I got California scientists of the year 
down here in Los Angeles and everything 

555
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,880
it.
I was literally the blue white boy until

556
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,510
I question HIV.
All of these connections were going,

557
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,340
wow,
I'm,

558
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:09,420
I'm

559
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,720
so.
You are the example of someone who is 

560
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:14,720
punished for thinking outside of the 
box.

561
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,550
I'm vague,
but let me ask you,

562
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,340
have you.
Do you have.

563
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:22,341
Do you have peer reviewed research,
peer reviewed primary research to 

564
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:26,481
support your theory because you're 
dealing with a lot of research on the 

565
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:30,231
other side and a lot of money was put 
into it by a number of independent 

566
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,110
organizations that looked at the data.

567
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,180
Okay.
Let's go to just show you this last 

568
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,180
paper,
but anyway,

569
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,180
I have it in the back.
Kim?

570
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,180
Yes.
Oh,

571
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,040
because that.
Isn't that the big question for a 

572
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,040
scientist?
What is your.

573
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,040
You want to go grab it,
grab it.

574
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,940
Don't grab it.
Sure.

575
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,540
Bring it over.
No big deal.

576
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,080
How many.
But I mean this was the last one and 

577
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,541
this was the most difficult to get 
published because it can't,

578
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,860
it can't be healthy.
Being a gay dude.

579
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,900
Just thinking about what it's like to be
a dude and think about no one there to 

580
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,260
stop the fun and it just must be.
Can you imagine a day?

581
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,450
Your body must be just trying to like 
find zinc,

582
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,440
you know,
and he goes,

583
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:14,800
I didn't get a 24 hour fitness right now
and I can see six gorgeous guys.

584
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,190
I could bang it out and not even look on
their face and let him it like that.

585
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,480
You said you can go to burke woman's a 
bunch of girls there.

586
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,290
You can just bang.
I'd be like for free.

587
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,570
I'm married.
I can't do that.

588
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:31,110
So yes.
I mean initially I published in in the 

589
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,260
best of the channels.
It was in science,

590
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:37,290
the first debate in the science,
which is the most popular American 

591
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:37,290
children.
Yes,

592
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,670
and then I published in the proceedings 
of the National Academy of Sciences.

593
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,320
I was when I was still considered as 
part of the club and then I became 

594
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,810
execute excommunicate and then it 
becomes very difficult.

595
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,490
Peer Peer Review means only the 
establishment prevails.

596
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,890
That is censorship by the mainstream.
Lost everything in that is mainstream,

597
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:04,350
but it exclude everything that 
challenges their own investments and 

598
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,820
their own piece.
But that's a little unfair to scientists

599
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:11,821
who are really diligently working on 
trying to find a cure for a lot of 

600
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:11,821
diseases.
I mean there are a lot of,

601
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,780
as you know,
I'm sure and you know them.

602
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:19,050
There are a lot of.
There are a lot of scientists who are 

603
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:19,270
independent thinkers who who want to 
make a difference like yourself,

604
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,660
and it seems to me that more of those 
voices would have,

605
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,020
would have made themselves heard in in 
the,

606
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,510
I guess it's now 25 years that the aids 
virus has been in,

607
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,490
in,
in the news.

608
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,650
Yeah,
so,

609
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,040
so,
so if that's the case,

610
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,320
that's where I'm confused in the other,
the other disconnect,

611
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:42,930
the county's Taiwan.
Same letter to the Los Angeles Times

612
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,450
or something.
You get this new really concerned.

613
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,750
Can you publish the letter now?
He wanted to get a dialogue.

614
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,180
You will not get anything published.
Nothing.

615
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,870
It's complete censorship because they 
don't believe because they believe the 

616
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,771
science has already been settled.
Whereas in part by the there are several

617
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,390
journalist who interviewed me in the 
past on this.

618
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:10,110
They did it once and not again even go 
Jonah's channel and they hold one story 

619
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:13,270
and then there were no longer invited to
conferences.

620
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,810
The quality center called the Centers 
for disease control or have vouchers at 

621
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:22,951
the Nih,
Nia ard into institute for Allergy 

622
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:22,951
Infectious.
No more answers.

623
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,850
How many are excluded?
There are a lot of gay people.

624
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:29,851
I think though,
if they were sitting here would have a 

625
00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:29,851
very strong argument for you to say,
so listen,

626
00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:31,950
I was dying.
I was 85 pounds.

627
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,290
I'm now 170 pounds after obviously his.

628
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,620
His answer would be when they're taking 
the protease inhibitors are also weren't

629
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:43,621
doing meth.
That's his answer in part and one would 

630
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:45,550
have to see those cases.
They're not so many happy faces on this,

631
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,770
on these trucks.
I don't know.

632
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,810
They're toxic.
There's.

633
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,550
I've read that there they have nasty 
side effects.

634
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:54,010
They cause you to carry lumps.
Side effect.

635
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,880
That is the only effect you get.
You taking a post,

636
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,880
so how is it?
Here's the question,

637
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,210
side effects.
They didn't.

638
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,370
Most of them get it.
Now when they have a low t cell level,

639
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,470
they are asymptomatic.
They have no disease,

640
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:12,010
and then they start taking these clocks 
and on average six years later,

641
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,130
they're dead on average.
That's the statistic.

642
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Let us show you the guys like Magic 
Johnson who is gaining weight all the 

643
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,440
time and says,
I'm taking my medications.

644
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:22,690
When you ask or anybody asked what he 
takes,

645
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,340
he never hear an answer.

646
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,440
My medications,
it's probably b vitamin C or whatever it

647
00:31:28,441 --> 00:31:30,040
is,
but I don't know what it is.

648
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:33,640
So if somebody has HIV comes to you and 
they said I have HIV,

649
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,940
am I going to die?
You say what up?

650
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,270
Don't take the first thing.
Don't take antibiotics.

651
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:44,310
That's eats by prescription.
That's exactly what you get from these 

652
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,890
trucks.
What is what it is you.

653
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,290
You kill your t cells.
You caused cancer.

654
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,200
You'll kill your liver and your kidneys,
your heart,

655
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:53,840
your brain,
your.

656
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,340
Fortunately they become retarded when 
they don't notice it anymore than the 

657
00:31:59,340 --> 00:31:59,520
smile in the camera.
We are fine.

658
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,640
So,
so here's the question.

659
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:05,641
How many people,
how many scientists working on how many 

660
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:08,380
scientists are working on curing HIV?
Watch how many scientists are working in

661
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,290
the field on HIV and AIDS?
20,000,

662
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:15,420
$20,000.
How do they not understand what you're 

663
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,140
saying and how do they not see what 
you're saying?

664
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,260
How is it not being discovered all?
Let's stay with them.

665
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,800
How do they not understand what they are
saying for 20 years?

666
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:28,801
They're developing a vaccine.
Is the vaccine mater hard vaccine 

667
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:31,780
though,
or is not the vaccine that we need?

668
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:37,590
It's.
It's vaccinating against something that 

669
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:37,590
doesn't cause aids.
That's one answer,

670
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,990
but they don't live here that they 
remember it.

671
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Shannon is a British country doctor who 
invented vaccination in 17.

672
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:47,150
90 three.
Not In 1973.

673
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,740
17,
93,

674
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,920
four 60 pounds that he got from 
somewhere.

675
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,280
He developed the.
The pox vaccine is still called pocs 

676
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,010
because is the cow.
It worked.

677
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:02,660
The extracted from the cow and 
successfully protecting people against.

678
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,680
Oh,
now we have sog.

679
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,800
No,
long.

680
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:08,890
Long dead was Edward Jenner.
Okay.

681
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,560
Do you recall is still generic 
vaccination in 17,

682
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:17,570
93.
I think he saw the milkmaids that they 

683
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,961
weren't.
They were exposed to cowpox and I said 

684
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:19,961
maybe if I.

685
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:24,320
and that's what I.
and here we have the scientists the 

686
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,651
most.
It's the most advanced and most 

687
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:29,530
sophisticated and by far the most 
expensive scientific establishment that 

688
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,151
has ever lived on this planet.
The American scientists to get 10 to 

689
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:37,901
$20,000,000,000
a year to research it and they keep 

690
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:37,901
saying,
oh,

691
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:38,650
we need a vaccine.
All we do is actively,

692
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,740
Edward Jenner did for 60 pounds in once.
He's 200 years ago.

693
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,980
Now they're missing out with a 25 years.
What do they have?

694
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,610
Ent.
So nothing they on a white coat,

695
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,200
but viruses are very different,
right?

696
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,720
We're not so small.
Parks being a.

697
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,420
do you have to,
as you said,

698
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,880
SARC and all.
We have against virtually all viruses,

699
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:01,970
we have vaccines and we have a perfect 
one against HIV.

700
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,760
That's what the test measures.
There's antibody Novos.

701
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,640
Exactly.
We do because it works so well.

702
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,940
That's why Gallo,
the nation's leading aids researcher had

703
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:15,941
to steal it from France because he 
couldn't get it out of people who have 

704
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:18,350
the virus,
but they don't ask those questions.

705
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,970
That's what are the.
What are the.

706
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,940
What was the French discovery?
Because Gallo stole the franchise 

707
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,630
franchise research and took credit for 
it.

708
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,810
What were.
What were the French scientists say that

709
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:33,260
they were the ones who actually isolated
the HIV virus?

710
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,800
You would have never heard of him 
without colonial US propaganda behind 

711
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,760
it.
They said it could be every biology set.

712
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:45,970
Oh,
my virus could cause cancer or have 

713
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,200
published me.
I'm famous and I get money and I'm 

714
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,310
promising something horrible if you 
don't follow me.

715
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,580
So that's what they all did.
The gala was one of the most successful 

716
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,361
one.
He was just at the right time when the 

717
00:34:58,361 --> 00:34:59,150
AIDS epidemic came up.
I have device vaccines coming soon,

718
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,310
coming soon.
Here I am.

719
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,040
While his colleague in France got the 
Nobel prize,

720
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:08,120
but he didn't because they call them.
So is that how it works?

721
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,570
Like he invents.
He starts working on some sort of a cure

722
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:16,571
and then funds role in.
It starts up a business of working to 

723
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:17,420
develop a vaccine grants,
you know when you work,

724
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:22,421
how much,
how much money is involved in something 

725
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:22,421
like that.
Just millions and millions.

726
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,680
It's an annual budget.
Over $10,000,000,000.

727
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:27,920
We have a team of people working a bit 
over 10 billion for $8,000.

728
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,070
It's almost as much as because it gave 
you.

729
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,840
What you're saying is it's an industry 
and there's no way to stop this industry

730
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:40,841
with the truth that these are not 
willing to look at the truth because 

731
00:35:40,841 --> 00:35:42,390
there's a massive amount of money that's
being spent perpetrating a lie.

732
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,450
That's what you're saying.
When did journalist or any scientists 

733
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,080
really speaks up and sweat this year in 
income DC?

734
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,830
Immediately.
Olga Kay,

735
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,590
molly's junkie,
crazy guy,

736
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:57,610
disbursed Nazi.
What have you mastered it so they have 

737
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,830
immediately.
This is kind of pulling it out.

738
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,180
It did have an epidemic.
I mean,

739
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,600
we did have an AIDS epidemic.

740
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,350
I remember you saying that it coincides 
with drug.

741
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,310
People are still.
You remember the crack epidemic,

742
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,320
man,
remember that very distinct thing that 

743
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,880
happened when crack your whole.
We've had epidemics,

744
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:19,060
but the whole youth,
the large large scale use of 

745
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,500
recreational drugs was known in America 
after Vietnam.

746
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,020
Then he came back somewhat more open to 
the rest of the world as before known 

747
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,790
familiarized with drugs from Vietnam and
evolution by losing the war,

748
00:36:34,581 --> 00:36:37,780
whatever it was,
and then all of a sudden tuck it.

749
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,750
Tuck epidemic picked up or the did 
stated the yellow submarine.

750
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:42,950
Did it?
Everybody liked it,

751
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,650
but yeah,
that was.

752
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,980
That was the place for it.
It was coming in the seventies,

753
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,040
in the eighties,
and all of a sudden we have aids.

754
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,950
It's all talked related.
It.

755
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,870
What if it were a sexually transmitted 
disease?

756
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:03,220
We have four and a half million 
heterosexually produced babies in this 

757
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:09,390
conduct to Duesberg.
If you can just try to talk into the 

758
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:09,390
microphone.
Oh,

759
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:09,390
sorry.
There's tone.

760
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,550
There's.
There's lots of heterosexual sex.

761
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,270
What does the virus have?

762
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,730
I'll tell him.
I'll tell you there's an answer.

763
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:18,780
There's an answer.
Because in Africa it was a.

764
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:22,390
It was a heterosexual disease in the 
United States and Europe.

765
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:27,490
Europe had never happened.
Now if there's a lecture about it and 

766
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:27,810
see what,
they couldn't figure it out.

767
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:30,290
What was it was their secondary 
infection was a poor healthcare.

768
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,190
Why in the world we're straight men in 
Africa,

769
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:36,300
getting it by the drugs and the the,
the cases for straight men in the United

770
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,300
States are vanishing.
Unless you're talking about gay men and 

771
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,300
intravenous drug use.
So what I'm saying,

772
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,790
here's what they found.
Colleagues,

773
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,870
executive trucks,
not with six and not with,

774
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,110
well,
here's what I read and maybe you can 

775
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,110
help me with this.
What?

776
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,110
What?
Juan Enriquez,

777
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,730
who was a venture capitalists who invest
in different kinds of medical technology

778
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:54,990
and deals with all this stuff.
He said,

779
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,170
what they found was there was a genetic.

780
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,920
There was a genetic variation in all 
people of northern European extraction 

781
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,971
who had survived the black plague.
That particular genetic variation makes 

782
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:11,931
you very resistant to the HIV virus.
The only way a straight man gets HIV is 

783
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:16,971
if it's pushed into his bloodstream with
a needle or through anal sex or 

784
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,320
something like that,
or blood transfusion,

785
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,710
having regular vaginal sex with a woman,
and in fact even gay men who were having

786
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,730
doing the actual fucking doing the 
actual sex as opposed to getting it were

787
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:33,750
the ones that survived the epidemic.
So there is no question that that,

788
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,710
that however,
in Africa,

789
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,770
in Subsaharan Africa,
they did not go through the bubonic 

790
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,870
plagues that that we did in Europe.
They did not develop that variation in 

791
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:48,331
their genes and that's why they.
That variation is missing in their 

792
00:38:48,331 --> 00:38:51,841
genetic structure.
That's why they get aids and that's why 

793
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:51,841
the and that was the.

794
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,980
Any genetic explanation like that is a 
taco suspicious.

795
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,790
Oh,
come ditching.

796
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,470
The genes are different between 
homosexuals and heterosexuals.

797
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,310
That is not.
Yeah.

798
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:09,350
They would have.
If it's different genes are having 

799
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,831
different sex.
Dr Duesberg I'm sorry to keep reminding 

800
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:12,831
you of tuck cells.
Could you talk into the microphone?

801
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:17,810
We really want to hear you complaining.
So the any of the genetic argument says 

802
00:39:18,411 --> 00:39:23,411
it is very suspicious that in a 
population to homosexuals would have 

803
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:24,860
changed it.
A different sections.

804
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,060
We have a that that's not what he's 
saying.

805
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:32,061
What he's saying is that there are 
certain certain people that got it 

806
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:33,320
through heterosexual means like they,
they,

807
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:38,190
they didn't have this genetic variation.
It doesn't mean that in America there is

808
00:39:38,191 --> 00:39:42,450
no job and no way in the whole planet 
even know heterosexual.

809
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:47,510
It's everyday deputy Dick didn't want 
and scared everybody is going to split 

810
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:52,161
into heterosexual.
All of a sudden even mainstream 

811
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:55,551
conservative,
the public in whatever it is we're 

812
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:58,341
interested in.
Even the John Wayne talk to regular 

813
00:39:58,341 --> 00:39:58,620
about it.
You have to do something.

814
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,760
Otherwise.
Our Kit's going to come on with eight.

815
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,810
Yes and nothing ever happened and is 
sexy as or excuse as they used to be.

816
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,700
They produce.

817
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,040
They produce four to $5 million babies a
year and none of them get a no,

818
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:14,980
but the data wasn't.
Yeah,

819
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,480
all to the one I was saying,
one of the ICS.

820
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,660
The explanation for mainstream science 
would be the reason gay men get aids is 

821
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:21,940
because there's something called high 
risk,

822
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:25,990
low risk behavior when you have 
unprotected anal sex with another man.

823
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,360
You are.
You are.

824
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:27,600
Yeah.

825
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:34,360
You are those capital areas.
There are micro tears and the semen that

826
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:39,361
carries the virus can actually push it 
into the bloodstream that that would be 

827
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:40,210
why?
That would be like anal sex.

828
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,330
It's more,
but wait a minute from nowadays,

829
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,690
since you get porno movies,
you can get it on your laptop.

830
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:52,370
The girls,
maybe you can get your hands on your 

831
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,060
lap.
Come on.

832
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,080
It's a serious discussion.
Is very serious,

833
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,460
but you see the girls getting into any 
code.

834
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,780
That's true.
Some of them make a profession out of 

835
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,020
it.
Some of these to pawn stars.

836
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,490
That's what I call my favorite poets,
and you're saying they don't get no 

837
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,620
nowhere.
They'll put.

838
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,470
That's another prediction of the NIH 
failed.

839
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,170
All the prostitutes will be the first 
one you hear.

840
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:26,440
What did you hear?
The new laws that just got passed?

841
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:31,441
Measure b passed last I heard he saying 
no more.

842
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,010
No more porn.
We're not going

843
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,530
to call her and is going to have to 
start doing in Nevada.

844
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,020
One,
what they're doing is they're saying you

845
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:41,300
have to wear condoms.
Dental dams,

846
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,360
a dental dams to world men and women.
Men Dental dams during even worse is 

847
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,191
that there's even something in there 
that says that if you're a husband and 

848
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:54,521
wife and you just want to broadcast sex 
on a Webcam to our economy in your own 

849
00:41:54,521 --> 00:41:58,301
house,
you have to have a permit that costs 

850
00:41:58,301 --> 00:41:58,301
like 8,000.
Like a lot of money.

851
00:41:58,301 --> 00:41:59,440
They did it.
Yep.

852
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,130
Did it.
The population did it.

853
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,930
It's not the government.
We voted that in.

854
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,960
That's shame on us.
They also voted that genetically 

855
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,500
modified foods thing in it that get 
voted in and I'm a fan of that person.

856
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,990
What is it that doesn't have to be 
labeled?

857
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,260
Yeah.
I'm a fan of genetically modified foods 

858
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:17,260
because.
Right,

859
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:17,260
but why are you a fan of them?
Not being late,

860
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:17,510
but yeah,
that's crazy.

861
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:22,040
How is it that is the domain to label 
everything.

862
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,320
You should always be transparent and it 
costs no more money.

863
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,950
It's a money thing.
It's a monsanto.

864
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,560
They,
they're,

865
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,230
they're buying it out.
Those sons of bitches.

866
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:35,200
So Dr Duesberg how many,
how many people like on a.

867
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,400
When you have these conversations and 
you,

868
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:39,890
you,
you talk about this connection.

869
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,510
How many people think you're crazy?

870
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,900
Yeah,
I,

871
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,140
I'm not so sure that so many.
A sure that I'm crazy.

872
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,460
They just don't want to.
Once,

873
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,020
just too hot a topic.
20.

874
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,320
Face it.
I see.

875
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:55,440
They don't see if you,
my colleagues,

876
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:59,260
my former friend Jay Levy or held or 
found,

877
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,840
she was notified,
but Gallo,

878
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:04,080
we were close friends.
We met several times a year.

879
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,020
Conferences and trying foods and what 
have you.

880
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,290
What?
Deep cannot talk about it with me.

881
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,200
They realize they have no good answers.
They have.

882
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,540
They would have known published it.
I would be finished.

883
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,930
I would not just be excommunicated 
politically,

884
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,590
not get students.
They would pull from your home in,

885
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,560
in,
in lighting,

886
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:27,561
in a scientific paper.
That would be my the end of my song and 

887
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:27,561
say,
look,

888
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,790
your dispute status,
or you can't answer it,

889
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,580
but they can't.
That's the topic.

890
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,930
That's why it goes on and on.

891
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,450
They have no answers why they can't make
a vaccine.

892
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,510
They have no answers.
Why the girls heterosexuals don't get 

893
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,030
it.
They have no answers why they can't find

894
00:43:42,031 --> 00:43:47,031
the bibles and you're dying from it.
That is a complete paradox in biology,

895
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,510
in chemistry,
in fact in science.

896
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,900
How can you get a fatal consequence 
foreman nondetectable cause that is 

897
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,440
absolutely electric,
isn't not cancer that serve my God.

898
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,660
You look at the second sale,
you'll see a lot.

899
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,780
That's what I'm doing now.
You have 60,

900
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,820
60,
70 chromosomes in there where there 

901
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,970
should be 46 mm.
There is a big cost there.

902
00:44:11,971 --> 00:44:14,500
You can see they make protein and on an 
Ehr it's a difference.

903
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,300
You talk a little bit about cancer since
you work on it.

904
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,710
Well,
I want to stick to this so

905
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:25,710
they they see more than that.
Hardly any scientist wants to have a 

906
00:44:26,021 --> 00:44:29,080
name in a field.
Is naive.

907
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,850
Romantic as I was at and say,
okay,

908
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,250
we have to go the other way.
This doesn't end up.

909
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,620
They have made their career.
They have.

910
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,320
They put a professor,
they get their merit increases.

911
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:45,321
They consult companies or owned 
companies and they have to tell the 

912
00:44:45,321 --> 00:44:47,610
postdocs and students in their company 
so we on the wrong paths.

913
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:51,390
We have started all over that.
Hardly anybody is able to make that.

914
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,210
The wives would beat them up or the kids
would say,

915
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:55,710
where's the money?
They lose.

916
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:58,740
They would lose their jobs or their 
investments.

917
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,160
They piss away the investments.
If this is true,

918
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:04,410
how is it that you're the only one who's
talking about this?

919
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,320
You're not the only one,
but I'm.

920
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,140
I'm as a friend,
good friend of mine,

921
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,040
a publisher from New York.
Have you been a scientist?

922
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,850
Also a hobby.
He was editor of nature biotechnology.

923
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,070
He wrote this book about me.
How do you unpack how to add butter,

924
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,110
your own pet here?

925
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,910
When we know,
I mean he meant it when he said this,

926
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,960
he explained it how it happened just for
being caught an ethical scientists to 

927
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:36,340
say what the,
what the science tells me.

928
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,510
Have you debated any other scientists 
about the subject of times in the 

929
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,420
beginning,
even in the journal Science,

930
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,560
there is a debate between me and Carlo 
Plattner and timid and it's called 

931
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,450
equality policy form.
I,

932
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:55,710
I,
my part was called HIV is not causing 

933
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:55,710
aids.
There's,

934
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,120
it was.
And then he could answer to each other.

935
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,360
Ones that don't.
Then they hold one more editorial about 

936
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:02,490
it and then they don't want to write 
about it anymore.

937
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,880
So that's the only time you've ever sat 
down with another scientist and had a 

938
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:07,880
form.
Well,

939
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,590
no,
it's not the only table.

940
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:13,610
There were several other occasions here.
But what do they say to you?

941
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,600
What is their response and what's wrong 
with their response?

942
00:46:16,601 --> 00:46:20,150
So what is their response to your 
arguments that it's all drug related and

943
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:21,240
then the,
these,

944
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:22,740
uh,
having a,

945
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:27,741
a,
something that we can only detect it in 

946
00:46:27,741 --> 00:46:28,350
the form of an antibody and saying that 
that's what's killing you is ridiculous.

947
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:33,351
It doesn't work.
It is a Duisburg doesn't know indirect 

948
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:35,610
mechanisms in individ causes and 
cofactors.

949
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:40,910
And once I'm gone,
they don't mention the cofactors 

950
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:40,910
anymore.
They named me factors like drugs.

951
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,990
What drugs,
lifestyle choice,

952
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,010
lack of sleep.

953
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,980
Dr.
There are a lot of doctors who are 

954
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,140
medical doctors that you go to when you 
have HIV and you take your drugs and 

955
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,851
they're in the trenches.
They'd been there a long time and they 

956
00:46:57,851 --> 00:47:00,581
are,
they are involved in prescribing you a 

957
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:04,481
certain amount of medication to keep 
quote unquote your viral load to a 

958
00:47:04,481 --> 00:47:07,451
manageable level.
These are people in the trenches that 

959
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:11,440
watched people die and are now keeping 
people alive with those drugs.

960
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:16,400
So I'm just curious as to all those 
doctors that are doing that in Africa,

961
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,800
in Europe and the United States in East 
Asia,

962
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,230
etc.
W w,

963
00:47:20,231 --> 00:47:22,850
w,
and I know there's a lot of money there,

964
00:47:22,851 --> 00:47:27,851
but they are doing that work.
It seems to me that if it Wasn't 

965
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:31,150
Working,
if they hadn't seen direct results,

966
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,240
and I'm talking about non drug users,
they hadn't seen direct results say in 

967
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,871
africa With heterosexual men when they 
were dying and now they are die.

968
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,040
It seems to me a lot of people would 
say,

969
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:47,041
hey guys,
people are still dying at the same rate 

970
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:47,800
or whatever it regardless of lIfestyle 
change,

971
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,630
people stick to their lifestyle.
For the most part,

972
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,160
no.
In America is the minimal amount of 

973
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,011
eight cases like 30,000,
40 $0 a year and guess who they are to 

974
00:47:58,011 --> 00:48:02,140
certain male homosexual sin asserta 
junkies and that is because of a virus.

975
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,880
It's a small.
It's not by the toes.

976
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,520
As you say.
It's a very small population.

977
00:48:08,521 --> 00:48:10,950
It's always the same list groups and 
they get these talks,

978
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:16,250
so if you are a little scientist other 
than the doctor prescribing pills and 

979
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,491
doing what all other doctors do and 
following what they call standard of 

980
00:48:20,491 --> 00:48:21,760
care.
If you violate and say,

981
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,980
I don't prescribe anything,
they come and so you sometimes you,

982
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,030
so anyway,
so they could skype,

983
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:32,510
but what you need to prove that these 
trucks are doing things in animals or in

984
00:48:33,361 --> 00:48:37,020
humans,
you need to do a controlled study,

985
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,020
totally controlled study.
You have to have,

986
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,370
let's say here and I identify with hiv 
positive men,

987
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:46,710
gay or heterosexual,
whatever they are,

988
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,690
and they have another,
another hunted,

989
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,900
matched same age,
same lifestyle,

990
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,910
maybe soldiers with the us army.

991
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,160
You have to have two and they are not 
treated and then we'll see who is doing 

992
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,210
better.
Then you'll find out,

993
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,010
but when you use three talks and this 
truck and that truck and that countertop

994
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,680
on top of them and don't comply and sold
them down the toilet,

995
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,600
all of these stories are very well 
known.

996
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,090
You can only guess and they say,
okay,

997
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:14,640
my truck works.
It costs a thousand dollars a month.

998
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:17,880
Very good business.
It's lasting three or four or five years

999
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:22,881
until they're dead.
That's what the drug companies lovell 

1000
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:22,881
longer than that.
I mean,

1001
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:25,310
people are on average about five years,
but they don't tell you that inhibitors,

1002
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,350
untuck,
I know people are living now.

1003
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:33,570
Your.
They always know somebody like magic 

1004
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,901
johnson.
He's gaining weight and I saw a lot of 

1005
00:49:35,901 --> 00:49:38,211
people die in six months.
Seven months is in the eighties and 

1006
00:49:38,211 --> 00:49:38,211
nineties night I've never seen that.

1007
00:49:38,211 --> 00:49:41,560
Even now they do,
but only when they faithfully take those

1008
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,830
plugs,
but they often say they do and then they

1009
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:46,250
don't have a microphone,
so it's a.

1010
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,430
It is in order to prove what you're 
saying and what they tell you,

1011
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,920
all their trucks works.
They love to sell those stocks.

1012
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,740
It's real good business and thousand 
dollar month.

1013
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:01,070
That's what for the rest of your life.
That's exactly what our companies love 

1014
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,140
best.
It's like chemotherapy.

1015
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:07,141
it's also a thousand dollars a month 
except it doesn't use the last that 

1016
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:08,670
long,
but what you need in order to pull if it

1017
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:11,820
works and have a hell of a time within 
cancer,

1018
00:50:11,821 --> 00:50:14,340
they've never done it done.
It was eight.

1019
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,420
They did it once in 87 and the 
consequences,

1020
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,810
the results were very devastating to 
people on set.

1021
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:27,230
A 10,
20 percent of them were dying while 

1022
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:27,880
they're treating them and they only get 
easy,

1023
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,310
wasn't it?

1024
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:32,270
Wasn't effective what it is.
They say that's what the admit now,

1025
00:50:32,271 --> 00:50:35,910
but for years they this audio,
you're a denialist you.

1026
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,080
That's one of the words they use.
I remember when they see they was always

1027
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:44,081
like,
you took it and you just hoped that it 

1028
00:50:44,081 --> 00:50:44,300
kept you alive a little longer than they
give.

1029
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,020
These companies are toy treatments,
blood transfusions.

1030
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:53,021
Many of them because their bone marrow 
was gone from act look really good.

1031
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:57,020
then two years later they're gone.
Yup,

1032
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:02,150
but it takes a while to develop,
but we're asking your doctor,

1033
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:09,310
show me a tItle,
scientific study where you have treated 

1034
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,370
and untreated and show me that the 
treated ones live longer,

1035
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,180
even one day longer.
I would like to see why.

1036
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,720
I think there's a lot of evidence to 
that,

1037
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:22,721
but I don't have days none.
There is no such study except the oil 

1038
00:51:22,721 --> 00:51:26,771
you to act,
which you already pushed aside a little 

1039
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:27,680
bit because you heard it the first time 
you do.

1040
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,980
You have much improved,
easy,

1041
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:34,050
tina.
What did act is still terminating dna 

1042
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,371
synthesis.
You use less now because you don't want 

1043
00:51:36,371 --> 00:51:36,371
to die during the trial,

1044
00:51:36,371 --> 00:51:37,190
so you're.
But you're.

1045
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:40,520
You're explaining it as if it's like a 
conspiracy,

1046
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:43,700
like they all are aware of it and 
they're poisoning them less to keep them

1047
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:48,701
around longer,
but they know they're selling the 

1048
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:48,701
poison.

1049
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:48,710
Don't know whether they all totally 
aware of it.

1050
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:53,770
How is it someone has to be aware of it 
consciously lower the dose to keep 

1051
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:53,770
people alive longer,
right?

1052
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,790
Yeah.
I don't know.

1053
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:57,950
How conscious do you hear it from all 
sides?

1054
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:58,850
You believe it.
You know,

1055
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,070
I,
I,

1056
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:04,150
I think there were a lot of good 
soldiers in sterling.

1057
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,300
He could have said,
look,

1058
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,950
let's stop this.
We go home.

1059
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:12,490
So it takes awhile to change your mind.
They took 1945 and another 10 million.

1060
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:19,130
What?
so you think that all these scientists 

1061
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,040
are aware of this issue,
that all these people who are working in

1062
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:23,140
the hiv aids field or in denial or do 
you think it

1063
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,540
denied?
I don't like to use these words.

1064
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,770
They're not that clear headed that they 
will be in denial.

1065
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:32,430
They have heard it so many times.
Each job so terrible.

1066
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:36,420
Even act and tuck designed to kill human
cells.

1067
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,650
It's a picnic compared to hiv to do with
you,

1068
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,500
but then you ask them,
what about the 30 percent of africans 

1069
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,060
who are said to be hiv positive or 40 or
whatever high percentage.

1070
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,210
Why on data?
Well,

1071
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,450
it's a different strain comes to the 
story that you had played for high 

1072
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:58,851
founded years ago and whatever this put 
sheet of buying something or what have 

1073
00:52:59,311 --> 00:53:04,311
you done.
They might tell you that they are dying 

1074
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:04,311
And now they're not because of the 
drugs.

1075
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:06,520
That's what they would tell you.
They don't have that many talks enough.

1076
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:12,350
Not even.
Not even bill gates and burst webcam 

1077
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:16,770
could have pleaded so many people in 
makeup and make him wait.

1078
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,310
They have now from 450 to one point 2 
billion.

1079
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,220
That's pretty good for a wireless.
Hmm.

1080
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,990
South africa's population is growing,

1081
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:35,220
exploding going is actually putting it 
very mildly from 450 to over.

1082
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:41,150
The only other explanation is there 
making super aids and they're going 

1083
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:43,290
bring it over here and it does.
It doesn't kill them.

1084
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,750
A different strain.
They found it's the same test stop.

1085
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,620
You're doing lies.
It's a super.

1086
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:52,320
Aids is going to kill us,
but not them in the africans.

1087
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:57,640
Is there a similarity to you between the
what your research with cancer and with 

1088
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:57,960
aids?

1089
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,270
Yeah,
sure it is.

1090
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,280
It came from the same starting point.
When I mentioned briefly when I first 

1091
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,751
came,
the hot thing intensity search was to 

1092
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:11,871
find cancer biosis and that's what it 
came you trying to find the house and 

1093
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:15,160
the houses were the top of the basic.
Sure.

1094
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:20,570
Cancer was a retrovirus.
I remember reading that got did two 

1095
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:23,000
miles was the most popular.
That's where I came in studying that 

1096
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:28,700
because it wasn't killing cells.
Unlike most viruses like polio and soap 

1097
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,780
and flew into measles,
mumps,

1098
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,600
fifth kills assemblies.
These replIcates that,

1099
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,110
they killed the cells and replicate in a
dying cells and then kill more,

1100
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,940
but let's have a strategy.
They essentially move into it,

1101
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:48,810
like you're engrossed would move into 
you and they stay.

1102
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,370
They stay part of the senate and 
essentially tax it a little bit inside,

1103
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,180
but very little there.
So mooches.

1104
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:58,750
Yeah,
so muchin past luci cells,

1105
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,390
they don't seriously did.
Don't do much.

1106
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,930
They did.
Then they are neutralized by antibody.

1107
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,520
You cannot even find it valuable when 
you look hard enough.

1108
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:10,700
Like with the methods we use no viral 
load.

1109
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:15,740
All this bullshit work expressions for 
finding a needle in a haystack that they

1110
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,620
don't do anything in any sales and 
they're ubiquitous.

1111
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:21,470
You find them in cows,
you find them in docs,

1112
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,410
you find him and find him in whites.
You find in monkeys what kills you with,

1113
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:30,411
uh,
with cancer and what cancer is a very 

1114
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,420
serious different business.
Then you have one sale,

1115
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,560
one not thousands or millions infected 
one that changes its chromosome.

1116
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,160
That is possibly the solid of a casino.
Chinos,

1117
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,210
some excellent.
And normally we have 46.

1118
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,340
All of our sales,
46.

1119
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,440
Then they behave when the pope comes,
work with and the controls work with 

1120
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,940
into building years of turning up of 
life.

1121
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:59,210
They've worked pretty well.
Now you change one out and make a new 

1122
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:00,750
species and it screws up all of these 
controls.

1123
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,800
It's a very different set attributable.
Presto call on or lung cancer has 60,

1124
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:10,410
70,
80 chromosomes instead of 46.

1125
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,750
All controlled health.
Or do you.

1126
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,790
Do you believe in chemotherapy?
Yeah.

1127
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:22,800
Yes.
About it there you'll have side effects.

1128
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:26,140
That's a good word for side effects.
It detects cancer,

1129
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,800
but for sure the cap tax you too because
there's no chemotherapy that can tell 

1130
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,600
the dna of species or from a cancer cell
that just came out of your own.

1131
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,450
Distinguish,
cannot distinguish,

1132
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:46,050
so the only edge you have and 
chemotherapies that the cancer is 

1133
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:50,310
relentlessly coin and in adults,
many of your cells are not going or it's

1134
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:52,700
just staying equilibrium.

1135
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,710
You don't code anymore.
You don't work.

1136
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,670
Oh,
I'm sorry.

1137
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,320
My chairman of my accent.
Talk.

1138
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:03,010
Gaining insights.
Replicate.

1139
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,070
Yeah.
replicated.

1140
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:07,420
so those.
That's what the chemotherapy works on,

1141
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,470
on replicating sense and the little edge
we have is your heart.

1142
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,440
Your brain,
your lungs,

1143
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:19,441
even they don't call in adults.
they replace things here and then the 

1144
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,560
plot,
the skin,

1145
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,560
the gods,
they call everyday like casey and that's

1146
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:28,561
where you see the effects of 
chemotherapy first to become immune 

1147
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:28,561
deficient.
They lose hail,

1148
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:32,920
they lose weight as exactly as the guys 
you describe when they take act in these

1149
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:37,930
trucks,
they cannot keep their food anymore 

1150
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:38,360
because the intestines or school.
What is your.

1151
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:43,380
What are your thoughts on the new age?
Ideas of what keeping the body alkaline 

1152
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,860
to avoid.
Cancers are bullshit.

1153
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,790
I doubt it will work.
You know,

1154
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:52,810
you don't believe in like iot is 
antioxidants,

1155
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:55,290
first of all.

1156
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,750
That's good stuff.
No,

1157
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,560
I mean,
but it doesn't work.

1158
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:02,860
Me keeping the body alkaline.
That doesn't really follow all the rules

1159
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:07,710
that my grandmother gave me come home 
early and to sleep well and it's.

1160
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,280
It could dive then you're doing all you 
can do to what you do.

1161
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,200
Eat meat and stuff and.
Yeah,

1162
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,750
but I,
I eat less than I used to.

1163
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,780
You don't need as much not pick.
I don't know why.

1164
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,100
Maybe that's sort of terrifying as much.
Yeah.

1165
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:31,900
Knowing as much as you know about 
viruses or is it terrifying like being a

1166
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:34,210
person,
like thinking about your body constantly

1167
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:38,050
at war with all these different invading
armies that are trying to kill it.

1168
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,150
That's what these viruses are 
essentially,

1169
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,500
but we have emerged out of a ocean of 
microbes and viruses,

1170
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,960
but syp at hip because we have an immune
system that is totally equipped to go to

1171
00:58:50,771 --> 00:58:55,150
war to to keep them down for 300 years,
80 years.

1172
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:58,960
That shit starts falling apart.
Who dies from an infectious disease it's

1173
00:58:58,961 --> 00:58:59,380
in,
in,

1174
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:01,360
in,
in this society is hardly anything.

1175
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,840
The last serious infectious disease 
epidemic was flu in 1988 at a time when 

1176
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:11,110
we didn't have vaccines yet.
We didn't know dna and rna and proteins.

1177
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:13,990
Yet we didn't even know dietary 
vaccines.

1178
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:19,170
Vaccines have been the most amazing 
invention that now after world war two 

1179
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,860
when there isn't any polio.

1180
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,980
Polio had a little deep theory of 
whooping cough,

1181
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:30,830
pertussis and measles.
In fact,

1182
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:35,890
one of the things that is always under 
underlooked when you read history is 

1183
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:36,080
that most people you read about in 
history,

1184
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:38,240
including presidents,
kings,

1185
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:41,810
peasants,
and ability all lost at least one child.

1186
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:47,410
That was a huge part oF of the of the 
character of our ancestors are very 

1187
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:52,751
recent ancestors.
They had all lost at least one child 

1188
00:59:52,751 --> 00:59:52,751
child,
and if you have children,

1189
00:59:52,751 --> 00:59:57,731
you know how,
how epic and how tragic that would be 

1190
00:59:57,731 --> 00:59:59,180
and how unthinkable it would be.
All,

1191
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:00,200
all,
all.

1192
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:04,040
most of our presidents are the people 
that were the elite,

1193
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:07,190
the most wealthiest of it touched 
everyone.

1194
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:10,870
It touches everyone and that's something
that we.

1195
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,190
We are very lucky to not have to lIve 
through.

1196
01:00:13,191 --> 01:00:15,260
For most of us,
we have answers.

1197
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,590
We hAve answers for those pathogens,
answers for those viruses,

1198
01:00:18,591 --> 01:00:20,020
answers for those epidemics.

1199
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:25,350
Biochemistry didn't have biochemistry.
They didn't know what he takes to 

1200
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:29,801
maintain an optimal immune system.
Even even if you eat so called junk 

1201
01:00:29,871 --> 01:00:31,520
food.
Now in burger king,

1202
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:35,030
get salad leaf there with some tomato 
slice.

1203
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,030
It may not be there,
but we didn't know it costs.

1204
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:40,980
Garvey didn't know vitamin c deficiency 
that queen victoria,

1205
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:43,040
I had a lot of booths and schnapps in 
eight,

1206
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:48,050
seven except poor coast,
but it didn't have a banana or half a 

1207
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:48,050
year.
That's right.

1208
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:53,410
That's right.
So that post why the mortality and the 

1209
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,360
susceptibility to infectious diseases 
was much higher.

1210
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:59,970
The old days when you didn't have any 
antibiotics of course,

1211
01:00:59,971 --> 01:01:04,540
and you didn't have any anesthesia.
Anesthesia made.

1212
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,960
We've made great inroads and you give a 
lot of credence as we've talked to you 

1213
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,430
give.
It's very interesting to hear you talk 

1214
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,430
because you're so mean.
You're very.

1215
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:16,610
You give a great deal of credit to a lot
of mainstream science.

1216
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:21,950
Where you deviate is in one area which 
is this like a he listening to you speak

1217
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:26,770
about the effective nature of a 
chemotherapy on a virus on,

1218
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,310
on,
on,

1219
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:32,340
on cancer for example.
Where you veer off is very specific and 

1220
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,550
that is in the question of does hiv 
causes aids?

1221
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:39,551
So I listened to you and you're so lucid
and you're so scientific is trying to 

1222
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:41,440
say you're crazy without being.
No,

1223
01:01:41,441 --> 01:01:41,900
no,
no,

1224
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:42,560
I'm not.
No,

1225
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:43,940
I'm not.
What I'm saying is that what's what's,

1226
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:49,060
what's interesting to me is that you're,
you clearly are a scientist who is 

1227
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,180
immersed himself in the traditional 
notion of,

1228
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,210
of,
of peer reviewed study,

1229
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,990
of,
of,

1230
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:58,991
of double blind study.
Changed the way you look at this 

1231
01:01:58,991 --> 01:01:59,330
argument for not yet.
Not yet.

1232
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,400
Probably not.
Because I'm not a scientist.

1233
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:06,401
I don't have.
I have somebody on the other side here 

1234
01:02:06,401 --> 01:02:06,401
sitting here.
I don't know anything.

1235
01:02:06,401 --> 01:02:06,401
I just read stuff.
I don't.

1236
01:02:06,401 --> 01:02:11,020
What do I know?
I don't even know what he's talking 

1237
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:11,020
about.
I just,

1238
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:11,020
I can parent.
Well,

1239
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:11,160
your articles are you.
Do you know?

1240
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:14,990
I buy my own experience where I did with
my own eyes.

1241
01:02:14,991 --> 01:02:16,810
See young men die,
uh,

1242
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:20,070
a lot by the droves.
I saw them die and

1243
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,700
then I saw them get better.
But not many of those young men.

1244
01:02:23,701 --> 01:02:28,701
We didn't really get to this.
How many of those young men were not 

1245
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:28,701
doing drugs?
How many of them?

1246
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:30,480
I don't know.
I don't know if you had a gas.

1247
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,600
Any of them.
A lot of men that I knew who died who 

1248
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,080
were dancers and who we're targeting.
We're not necessarily drug addicts,

1249
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:38,610
but they partied.
We partied a lot.

1250
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,160
Yeah.
Having having said that,

1251
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:45,060
having said that,
when even those drug addicts even.

1252
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:45,510
I mean,
look,

1253
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:47,460
the gay community still does a lot of 
drugs.

1254
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:48,920
They do a lot of math.
They do a lot.

1255
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:54,350
They do a lot of stuff.
There's no question that you can ask 

1256
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:56,391
anybody,
but the fact of the matter is even with 

1257
01:02:56,391 --> 01:02:56,391
that drug use,
if you go to the abbey,

1258
01:02:56,391 --> 01:02:58,320
if you go to these places on in west 
hollywood,

1259
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:01,620
they're not dying by the drugs the way 
they were in the eighties and nineties.

1260
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:06,650
That's where I have a disconnect.
That's where I have trouble buying your 

1261
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,070
theory because it's my own now.
You have to be careful by the way,

1262
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:13,071
deducing from your own experience and I 
know that because you're going to have 

1263
01:03:13,071 --> 01:03:13,980
to start doing more gay research.
That's right.

1264
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:15,930
By limited,
it's very limited.

1265
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:20,931
Some leather pants,
but that strikes me is where you're 

1266
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:23,400
getting a lot of resistance because you 
are.

1267
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:26,580
You are clearly a mainstream scientists 
and a lot of ways you just.

1268
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:31,610
You just happened to have this,
this theory on it and it's interesting 

1269
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:31,610
to me.
It's actually,

1270
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:34,200
it's very interesting to me that you are
just interesting.

1271
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:34,910
I don't know enough.

1272
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,910
Qc meet coldly,
collect the seesaw.

1273
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:41,280
Me,
my arguments are completely conservative

1274
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:42,180
arguments.
They say,

1275
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:43,420
oh,
he's a deacon.

1276
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,670
Crazy guy.
I'm presenting them with a hundred years

1277
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:50,210
of science,
so our loads,

1278
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:55,220
if you like I say,
show me one microbe or one virus that 

1279
01:03:55,291 --> 01:04:00,291
causes a fatal disease.
When it's neutralized by antibody and 

1280
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:01,770
you see it making dna and rna and 
potent.

1281
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:07,490
That doesn't work.
you know there's no effect in biology or

1282
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,960
in chemistry without the cost.

1283
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,650
I'm sure this is going to be a very 
controversial podcast.

1284
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:16,350
We're going to get people far smarter 
than us that are going to want.

1285
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:21,370
I don't disagree with you.
Would you be willing to come back again 

1286
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:22,500
and have another scientist in here and 
talk about it and have a little debate?

1287
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:27,830
Good.
You dirty bitches in the scientific 

1288
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:27,830
community.
A challenge has been raised.

1289
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:27,830
It's been raised,
man.

1290
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:27,830
I,
I,

1291
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:28,600
I'm,
you know,

1292
01:04:28,601 --> 01:04:33,601
I'm going to ask her.
I can tell you that Joe Bryan was very 

1293
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:33,660
excited to come here because he was 
like,

1294
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,180
this guy can't be right and he gets 
very,

1295
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,490
you know,
very passionate about his ideas,

1296
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:41,730
but he's befuddled right now.
You've got him befuddled.

1297
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,830
I am the funnel and the funnel because 
you're so,

1298
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:45,960
you're so,
you're,

1299
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:50,961
so.
You give so much credit to mainstream 

1300
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:50,961
science.
You get so much credit to medicines that

1301
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:51,950
actually,
uh,

1302
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,230
I mean,
you're talking about viruses,

1303
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,400
vaccines.
You're talking about chemotherapy both 

1304
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,400
secretly hoping you'd be more obviously 
crazy.

1305
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,160
That's right.
And by the way,

1306
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:06,161
you're very likable.
I could wear the uniform where the 

1307
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,340
together that's,
that's even worse for your career.

1308
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:16,210
Then the aids thing,
you just made the nazi salute.

1309
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,340
He actually it to him.
He flipped off Peter Sellers.

1310
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:26,020
I'm still going to stick to my guns and 
I still do that and I'm still gonna say 

1311
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,870
that I believe that hiv causes aids.
You know what I believe?

1312
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,680
I believe I'm too stupid to understand 
this argument to unread too.

1313
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,300
I'm going to go with the vast majority.
Joe.

1314
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,180
You know what I just thought of when he 
first got here,

1315
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:38,770
we were talking about castles in 
Germany.

1316
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:41,350
I want to go to Germany and see the 
castles and stuff like that,

1317
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,240
and then I just noticed that the,
the,

1318
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:47,170
the nazis holding a white castle tee 
shirt.

1319
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,640
You just work that in because we weren't
talking about castles in Germany.

1320
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:55,600
I was talking to the doctor earlier or 
try to work with it and planted it.

1321
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:57,850
It's just.
So you mentioned the white castle.

1322
01:05:57,851 --> 01:05:59,940
That's his new thing.
Fuck,

1323
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,190
how dare you.
Do you ever come to standup comedy?

1324
01:06:03,191 --> 01:06:05,960
Do you ever watch any standup?
Dr.

1325
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,420
Vickery vanity,
but I love it.

1326
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,070
There's not a lot of stand up to come 
out of Germany.

1327
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,430
They're fairly linear people.
They make good cars though.

1328
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,440
Yeah,
make the shit out of some cars.

1329
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:19,820
It will invite you to a shelter.
So some good headway in munich and in 

1330
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,350
paleo.
Wouldn't eat it on stage here.

1331
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,300
You bring that bitch to the comedy store
watching meat hooks.

1332
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,020
You ever hear christina leah here?
Here.

1333
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:35,130
Chris is german guy where he talks about
how I've never seen kristalina do call 

1334
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:39,100
it,
talks about how scary like a german guy 

1335
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:39,100
threatens you.
It's like,

1336
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:39,100
you know,
what are you to do,

1337
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:39,100
bro?

1338
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,690
You're going to have,
and I have already pushed until my 

1339
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:44,970
friend has this whole amazing thing,
right?

1340
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:49,630
They just show up and I have already.
I would threaten you,

1341
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,330
but I have already pushed into my 
friend.

1342
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,560
That guy's dies.
Yeah.

1343
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:56,290
How did the germans get to be such a 
calculating,

1344
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:01,820
not wanting to say emotionless,
but controlled people have done happen.

1345
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,780
The most disciplined people in the world
here are.

1346
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:07,540
They know all of that.
If you look at that,

1347
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:09,010
whoa,
yeah.

1348
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:14,011
Lots of underneath it fucks up with the 
more god that shit get away from the 

1349
01:07:14,011 --> 01:07:17,780
theory goes.
That theory goes that the germans were 

1350
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:20,790
very,
very civilized people and a very 

1351
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:21,730
suppressive.
They're very oppressive,

1352
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:23,980
oppressed,
and suppressed.

1353
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:27,550
Manners,
protocol behavior.

1354
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:31,450
A delineation of authority is very 
important and and all that.

1355
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:35,560
Keeping all of your animal in check was 
what?

1356
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,340
What?
When,

1357
01:07:36,341 --> 01:07:38,260
when chaos struck,
it just went.

1358
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,320
They went crazy and light was so 
possible to manipulate in that way.

1359
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,910
That's why it's dangerous to control 
people,

1360
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:49,030
United States government and stop trying
to control people.

1361
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:54,031
You're creating nazi Germany.
Germany was a great to the notion of a 

1362
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:56,810
totalitarian regime to totalitarian,
meaning control over it.

1363
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,840
The total person,
not only in their body,

1364
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,180
but their mind.
That was a.

1365
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,720
That was a fascist nazi notion,
wasn't it?

1366
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:09,721
That was an idea behind that,
and they're the ones who invented 

1367
01:08:09,721 --> 01:08:10,720
crystal meth way.
Give that shit.

1368
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,740
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

1369
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:16,040
they use

1370
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,580
it on.
That's how the kamikaze is.

1371
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,840
They talked him into slamming the 
fucking planes and boats and shit.

1372
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:23,660
They were left out of their head.
All these japanese.

1373
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:26,660
I don't think so.
Oh yeah.

1374
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:28,130
Look,
I don't disagree with you.

1375
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:31,220
I've been wrong earlier.
I bet you're wrong now to excuse me,

1376
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:32,090
sir.
I've never been wrong.

1377
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,140
He shut you down,
dude.

1378
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:33,890
about cancer

1379
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,590
in the.
In there,

1380
01:08:38,591 --> 01:08:39,330
but it was in there.

1381
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:45,410
Yeah.
Well that's really popular with 

1382
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:45,410
soldiers,
amphetamines and steroids too.

1383
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:45,410
I mean,
look,

1384
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,320
if you want them to have some people out
there killing for you,

1385
01:08:47,321 --> 01:08:51,420
you want them hopped up on pills and on 
roids you do drugs

1386
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,580
now.
I can't get them.

1387
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,550
Shows you how things have changed.
In the seventies,

1388
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:07,730
eighties,
when I was fairly popular and the 

1389
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:07,730
students were much,
much more open.

1390
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:12,290
Students sit tight.
Tight disc.

1391
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,310
That's the only cocaine.
Avocado.

1392
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:19,430
The students.
Did you ever do acid?

1393
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,500
Do you ever try out?
What about weed?

1394
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:27,730
Who did that?
I tried a couple of data and didn't do 

1395
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:30,480
much good for me,
but a cocaine is like Texas.

1396
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:36,100
A lot of fun.
Shit.

1397
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:39,030
If it was lines,
not dejected,

1398
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:44,210
but the way you just said that to it was
lines not injected.

1399
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,390
Like who the fuck is injecting?
Who?

1400
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,530
I want to know how hard.
so german it was lance.

1401
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:57,510
We didn't inject you party hard.
Have enough.

1402
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,700
Let's see.
I asked a student to get me some food.

1403
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,980
I think too.
They would call a campus project.

1404
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,050
Yes.
They would go on a tight budget.

1405
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:08,800
Why not even got to speak with samsung 
now?

1406
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:12,380
Still teaching what?
What happened?

1407
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:13,760
Limited.

1408
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:19,310
No.
Captured student came to me or did they 

1409
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:19,760
told him this year,
then we'll wait for 15 years.

1410
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,560
No cans.
It's.

1411
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,250
I'm surprised that I'm still at a great 
price for your point of view,

1412
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,520
mike.
I mean I really sacrificed a lot of 

1413
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,731
status.
I was told you I was one of the blue 

1414
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:35,920
white boys in the days I was close to a 
nova for finding out the structure of 

1415
01:10:35,991 --> 01:10:38,210
the retrovirus,
the chines of retrovirus.

1416
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,850
That was me pulling the switch.
Chines chines nucleic acid,

1417
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,830
the size of it.
I realized that the potential.

1418
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:47,120
Wow.
Yeah,

1419
01:10:47,121 --> 01:10:51,170
so I was very popular in a fountain 
uncle gene in one of them and so that.

1420
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,710
Why didn't you keep your mouth shut 
about?

1421
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,100
Yes.
He.

1422
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:57,560
That's jesus.
That's crazy though.

1423
01:10:57,561 --> 01:10:59,180
I know it is.
I'm just being.

1424
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:04,190
I'm just follow orders.
I said somehow you have that feeling.

1425
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:09,890
We have done it before following orders 
or just do what's politically correct,

1426
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:15,070
but it was because you couldn't find the
hiv virus that we couldn't actually 

1427
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:15,070
isolated.

1428
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,230
Is that what it was that caused you to 
know?

1429
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:18,810
It was very clear that under those 
conditions,

1430
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:23,820
that virus neutralizing antibody doing 
whatever it's supposed to do,

1431
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:26,610
10 years after infection,
what does that mean?

1432
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:31,820
If I was turns to crank in 24 hours,
if you get infected by flu or herpes 

1433
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,420
syphilis or mums or anything at any 
party,

1434
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:41,690
well if nothing happens in a week,
every doctor will tell you you got away 

1435
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:44,110
even swiped through texts three to seven
days,

1436
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,810
but here you're saying,
okay,

1437
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:48,810
you had some wild party.
Ten yeArs later you have diarrhea.

1438
01:11:48,811 --> 01:11:52,770
It relates to fighting disease.
That's the idea.

1439
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:55,500
The idea is a virus incubates for a long
period of time like syphilis,

1440
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:57,780
syphilis does.
It shows stone.

1441
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,620
They have a very low iq,
extremely low,

1442
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:06,650
but does manifest itself as a source and
then it comes back to incubate and then 

1443
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:10,470
it attacks the brain and this white 
comes pick why?

1444
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,960
When they treated it with mercury,
it's iatrogenic doctor induced disease,

1445
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:21,650
they give you mercury and the and the 
standard of care was one km of mercury,

1446
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:25,800
the equivalent of act around the turn of
the century,

1447
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,710
a day for a year to kill your syphilis.
Yeah,

1448
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:34,730
by that time your align niche,
you got lots of people were most sugars 

1449
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:38,100
crazy.
By the way,

1450
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:44,780
the word german,
it's a german or if they were very close

1451
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:53,330
for a long time until the hurricane did 
very well.

1452
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,730
I think they were together.
Yeah.

1453
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:58,680
So anyway,
that's.

1454
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:00,840
That's the tertIary syphilis.
It's gone.

1455
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:05,250
You don't hear a word about it.
It will say a penicillin to.

1456
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:07,980
It's pretty effective.
You all not penicillin.

1457
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:12,981
Penicillin was.
Syphilis was around for millions of 

1458
01:13:12,981 --> 01:13:16,670
years.
People didn't get tertiary syphilis 

1459
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:18,771
surface.
No venereal disease can really kill you 

1460
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:20,550
or else we wouldn't be around the 70.
Created super pussy though.

1461
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:22,590
That's where things got out of hand.
No syphilis though.

1462
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,060
History,
I mean I've read a lot of history.

1463
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:27,630
So this was a big player in was 
tuberculosis.

1464
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,400
You weren't dying from it.
Yeah,

1465
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,570
already did.
Well,

1466
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:35,940
maybe when the doctor came in between 
mercury and arsenic,

1467
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,020
then sooner or later you are gone.
You never wear a condom.

1468
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:45,021
So what are you saying?
They were sick and they went to the 

1469
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:45,021
doctor and the doctor gave him something
to killed them,

1470
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:49,110
but because they were probably recovered
as you're saying,

1471
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:54,140
you'll of course,
so syphilis is something that you 

1472
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:54,140
recovered from.
Of course.

1473
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:54,960
I mean syphilis is millions of years 
old.

1474
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,840
Millions.
It's like a step sold.

1475
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:01,110
It hurts a couple of weeks and then it's
your annual rejected,

1476
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:02,630
your immune system rejecting.
What about.

1477
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:04,980
What about chlamydia and gonorrhea?
Same thing.

1478
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,560
Well,
I don't know so well about chlamydia.

1479
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:11,510
Chlamydia for women can actually be 
sterilizing or.

1480
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:11,930
Yeah,

1481
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:14,380
but it's not killing.
You know,

1482
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:19,381
a lot of times your body fights off.
Sooner or later you find them all so 

1483
01:14:19,381 --> 01:14:20,680
dirty trick that you get diseases from 
sex.

1484
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:24,000
That is the dirtiest when my kolbe 
shoes,

1485
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:29,010
everything they get,
but they have not been all that 

1486
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:29,010
successful.
We exploding.

1487
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:29,160
Yeah.
Yeah,

1488
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,100
that's true.
That's true.

1489
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:32,010
We keep,
we think loud.

1490
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,210
The civil case,
a dirty trick.

1491
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:36,520
Nature plays on you.
They will sit and wait in there.

1492
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:39,190
Actually joke.
Japanese created math by the way.

1493
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,060
Kamikaze.
Yeah,

1494
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:42,640
you're right about that.
Joe.

1495
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,430
Kamikaze used.
I still don't believe it there.

1496
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:44,900
I said,
yeah,

1497
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:45,910
well,
the,

1498
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:46,480
uh,
the,

1499
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:48,520
yeah,
the germans in creative japanese created

1500
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,290
the,
the talked the kamikazes into it,

1501
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:51,410
but the germans used it,
right?

1502
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:53,650
Yeah.
They were all working together.

1503
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,550
The japanese,
uh,

1504
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:02,330
in those days,
that whole fucking kamikaze king is one 

1505
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:04,270
of the nuttiest things that warfare has 
ever seen.

1506
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:08,670
Just dudes flying planes mapped out of 
their mind into boats.

1507
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:12,270
Ooh,
it's a,

1508
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:17,280
it's hard for people to listen to this 
and not think that it's almost 

1509
01:15:18,131 --> 01:15:23,131
impossible to be true.
There could be some sort of a gigantic 

1510
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:23,170
scandal on this,
uh,

1511
01:15:23,171 --> 01:15:26,950
this larger level and it's all just 
about pocketing money.

1512
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:32,120
How,
by how many of the people that are 

1513
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,511
involved in it do you think are actually
aware that there's no real connection 

1514
01:15:33,511 --> 01:15:34,960
between hiv and aids?
Is there a percentage of the people?

1515
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:37,610
Dave wouldn't see this radically see 
the,

1516
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:42,550
you call up with this as a scientist 
with biosil biologist you,

1517
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,180
it's hard to deny your own field is 
says,

1518
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:49,900
it's like the old man's still.
It's not easy to,

1519
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:54,410
to burn it out and to change it.
Very few scientists are,

1520
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:58,280
uh,
on the record to question their own work

1521
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,010
and particularly when it's such a big 
investment.

1522
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:05,610
They did the a d eight squeeze searches 
still favored anyway.

1523
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:08,930
They get all the money.
They want to get the investment papers.

1524
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,880
They have companies.
They never had it so good.

1525
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:15,450
Never they would be.
And as long as they can.

1526
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:16,730
When you asked him,
oh,

1527
01:16:16,731 --> 01:16:17,990
I used to ask them,
they always say,

1528
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:22,991
well,
I'm not an expert on what gay lifestyle 

1529
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:22,991
is.
I'm not an expert on epidemiology.

1530
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:28,030
I don't know why this was so slow.
My field is just look at the potain or 

1531
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:31,100
look at this talk,
but very compartmentalized.

1532
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,820
I noticed that that's an excuse of day 
to day.

1533
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:37,160
Could easily do it,
but they don't want to.

1534
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,260
They don't want to look at the side.
They say,

1535
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,430
well,
in my niche,

1536
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,290
I'm good.
I'm accepted.

1537
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:43,360
I'm guessing.

1538
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:47,280
Are there social consequences to 
questioning as a lifestyle shoe?

1539
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,820
You wouldn't be better.
Believe it.

1540
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:50,560
I.
Most of my friends,

1541
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:54,710
Chile is one of them in san francisco.
Auto co-discovered,

1542
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:57,670
gallo,
montane a tiny bit talks to me,

1543
01:16:57,671 --> 01:17:00,580
but they.
I'm not invited to meetings anymore.

1544
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,690
I have not gotten any nih.
Not one in 20 years.

1545
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:07,720
That's usually the test of the 
experimental scientist.

1546
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:12,320
I got every con I wanted for 20 years.
I came in 64 for 20 years.

1547
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:16,840
I had every cut I got.
I got the best deal,

1548
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:21,910
the head,
and it's called an outstanding science 

1549
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,540
scientists reward,
which was seven years unquestioned.

1550
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,280
What I did was I used it for that.
I said,

1551
01:17:28,281 --> 01:17:32,630
since I'm supposed to do a whiskey work,
I said,

1552
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:34,300
look at this was hiv.
That's something,

1553
01:17:34,301 --> 01:17:35,480
oh,
we won't get anywhere,

1554
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:41,260
and I thought they would hug me and say,
so you have done if you only use it for 

1555
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,100
the way,
but it the opposite was the case.

1556
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,520
Then I couldn't make me this paper here.
This is a rebirth of one that was 

1557
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:54,161
published before two years before.
Aids to me is it's so politically and 

1558
01:17:54,531 --> 01:17:58,190
socially charged as opposed to any other
disease because of the fact that it's so

1559
01:17:58,191 --> 01:18:01,430
predominantly affects the gay community 
gets part of it,

1560
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:04,820
but not all.
It's all from the scientists.

1561
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,520
They weren't they.
They were on the wrong track with 

1562
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,900
viruses and I was one of them.
We tried cancer.

1563
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,960
That would have been the big thing.
If he had found boluses as costs of 

1564
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,720
cancer,
we couldn't vaccinate in the deep cancer

1565
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:21,260
would have been possibly under control 
or even eliminated.

1566
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:22,690
That failed.
No,

1567
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:27,700
he all these luminaries a bishop and 
varmus and baltimore donnelly take few 

1568
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:33,611
blocks down here.
They had all nobel prizes for that 

1569
01:18:33,611 --> 01:18:36,040
already or temin with all my dissipated 
in science and they had no,

1570
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:36,710
we would.

1571
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:37,610
They say,
okay,

1572
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:40,880
my bios is not so important as I would 
like it to be.

1573
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:46,180
I finally had some.
I didn't get clinical relevance with 

1574
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:50,290
cancer,
but now with eight I finally am 

1575
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:50,290
clinically.
We have vowels.

1576
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:52,550
That's really bad and In reality that's 
what they like.

1577
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,090
They know the important and now he had 
these 10,000

1578
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:59,780
plus each aids researchers in these labs
working for 20,

1579
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,270
25 years.
Will it have you ever heard?

1580
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:05,690
Which is most definitely bio's see New 
York times.

1581
01:19:05,691 --> 01:19:08,830
It also the deadly wells each.
Hold on,

1582
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:14,240
let me put one more point and basically 
they're working with it for 20 years.

1583
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:16,220
They have no vaccine because they could 
make one.

1584
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:21,280
Yeah.
We talked about that early and not one 

1585
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,330
of ever came down with aids from the 
state levels.

1586
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,900
Neither of them will take.
No,

1587
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,350
maybe none of they have earned my.
Put mass.

1588
01:19:30,351 --> 01:19:33,830
Produce It for biochemical studies to 
make vaccine,

1589
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:38,980
you'll have to mass produce virus and 
then you take the proteins out and 

1590
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:41,420
vaccinate and for the test do you have 
to make antibody against seat?

1591
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:43,610
You need tons of files.
Not one,

1592
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:47,240
not a technician or the collaborator of 
these 10,000

1593
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:51,680
researchers that daily work with it have
gotten violence from.

1594
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:53,610
From the,
from the one they call.

1595
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,370
Isn't that odd?

1596
01:19:55,950 --> 01:20:00,950
It's odd,
but that could just be attributed to 

1597
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,450
being very careful with a deadly virus.
Onesie outfits.

1598
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:07,290
I mean extremely careful.
We have about thousand doctors,

1599
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:08,360
doctors

1600
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,340
per year getting hepatitis infections 
from patients.

1601
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:16,370
Do you think they're bringing their 
patients know that you're leaving out 

1602
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:21,510
something that's important though?
You're leaving out something if they 

1603
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,600
don't get it from working in tons of 
violence.

1604
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,610
Remember that's very important that.
No,

1605
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:25,030
that is very,
very.

1606
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,210
That's very interesting actually,
but.

1607
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:26,700
But,
but let me,

1608
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:31,701
let me just say one thing that I think 
we're leaving out a great deal of the 

1609
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:35,001
momentum for aids research and the 
reason so much money is devoted to age 

1610
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:40,290
research was because there was such an 
epidemic in the eighties,

1611
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:43,080
nineties with gay men who were dying and
they were.

1612
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,770
They literally,
I mean it,

1613
01:20:44,771 --> 01:20:47,080
it brought gay people out of the closet.
It,

1614
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,940
it organized gay gay people to say,
listen,

1615
01:20:50,941 --> 01:20:54,240
we're dying.
Nobody cares about us unless we get into

1616
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:59,241
the streets.
Unless we really created a strong lobby 

1617
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:01,920
for research for this disease.
We're not going to be here anymore.

1618
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,100
And if you talk to a lot of people,
Michael Collins,

1619
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,690
one of the people who spearheaded this,
they said,

1620
01:21:06,691 --> 01:21:09,330
we have nothing to lose.
We're dying.

1621
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,080
We're dying.

1622
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:12,070
He's actually addressed this already 
though.

1623
01:21:12,071 --> 01:21:14,590
He said that this is because of illicit 
drug use.

1624
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,710
I mean,
he's bringing something that people were

1625
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:20,320
not doing drugs or something.
That's actually a fact,

1626
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:25,650
the massive amount of drugs that were 
being used and he's correlating it to 

1627
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:27,070
the group of people that were using them
who got sick.

1628
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:29,880
I'm saying a lot of people say that they
were.

1629
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,030
Yeah,
that's what he's saying.

1630
01:21:31,031 --> 01:21:32,260
And they were.
So now we have a.

1631
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,600
We have a problem.
So who's right?

1632
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,790
Not everybody in the streets in the 
eighties,

1633
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,800
nineties who were,
who were fighting and organizing and 

1634
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,160
putting all their time into this.
We're doing drugs.

1635
01:21:42,161 --> 01:21:42,400
Who are here?

1636
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,780
No.
Okay.

1637
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:46,590
But he's saying,
and he's saying even today,

1638
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,190
that the people that are testing 
positive for drugs,

1639
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:54,300
they are junkies and drug testing,
positive for hiv.

1640
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:59,360
Are junkies and drug users primarily 
deal in America?

1641
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,240
What'd you say?
What'd you say?

1642
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:01,530
Children are.
Unless you're a child,

1643
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:05,700
unless you're a child from his mother to
a black children can get a feel.

1644
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:07,560
He actually got into a blood sugar 
transact.

1645
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,810
What about hemophilia to get it through 
blood transfusions,

1646
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:16,120
hemophilia.
Where are the eight cases among 

1647
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:16,800
hemophilia?
I don't know.

1648
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:21,820
I mean,
I'm just saying is that ever happened 

1649
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:24,350
where the head read ahead of fuel and 
particularly it went up tenfold after 

1650
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:29,610
they gave him act and they got eight.
Well that makes sense.

1651
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:35,270
The lifespan was increasing until 87 and
then he talked.

1652
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:41,070
So you're saying that in showing that 
they had the rush,

1653
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:46,130
the antibody,
that the body was successfully fighting 

1654
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:48,600
off of it though,
but even though they show this antibody,

1655
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:52,560
that was an excuse to introduce act into
the system to combat this thing.

1656
01:22:52,561 --> 01:22:55,640
It was creating this antibody body die 
and then the body dies,

1657
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,900
but a lot of people were getting a lot 
of hemophiliacs.

1658
01:22:57,901 --> 01:23:02,901
People were getting weird diseases,
which is why they got tested in the 

1659
01:23:02,901 --> 01:23:06,201
first place.
It wasn't like people were getting 

1660
01:23:06,201 --> 01:23:06,201
tested because of blood

1661
01:23:06,201 --> 01:23:07,690
transfusions all the time,
but,

1662
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:12,691
but,
but there are a lot of people that were 

1663
01:23:12,691 --> 01:23:12,691
that I knew that all of a sudden we're 
getting.

1664
01:23:12,691 --> 01:23:12,910
My buddy,
he got a.

1665
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:17,080
He got a huge blue thing.
He was rollerblading and he was this big

1666
01:23:17,081 --> 01:23:20,230
strapping guy who didn't do drugs.
He just had gay sex.

1667
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:23,170
He did not do drugs.
He was a personal trainer and he,

1668
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:28,440
my buddy will stand there and he had a.
He got a huge blue thing and all of a 

1669
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,370
sudden I went,
that's okay.

1670
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:33,040
That's good.
What about guys that don't do drugs

1671
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:35,600
and got aids?
What would happen with his.

1672
01:23:35,601 --> 01:23:36,410
Like his story.

1673
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:38,430
We are.
That's

1674
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,480
well,
he's telling you about one.

1675
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:42,680
What I.
My buddy died.

1676
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,760
Get maybe some.
There may be something to get on 

1677
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:47,760
medication than die.
No,

1678
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:47,760
no,
no,

1679
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,300
no.
You could guide before medication and he

1680
01:23:49,301 --> 01:23:52,400
died slowly and he died without any.
There was no azt.

1681
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:55,030
No nothing.
He fridays he didn't work.

1682
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,800
Then the second he tries to act and then
he died.

1683
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:04,810
Still sort of like makes his case will 
act is known to kill people.

1684
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:09,811
I mean they stopped using it for a 
reason to act is a terrible drug damage 

1685
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,200
alive today if he had protease 
inhibitors because.

1686
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:16,260
Because,
because a lot of the people that I saw 

1687
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:16,360
who were dying,
who stuck it out and not take act.

1688
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:17,080
Maybe you're right.

1689
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:22,170
Aids was killing people who didn't look.
Listen man.

1690
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:27,470
I'm sorry.
I watched too many people die with my 

1691
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:27,570
own eyes.
You can tell me you keep saying that,

1692
01:24:27,571 --> 01:24:30,960
but let me.
That act is what caused people to die.

1693
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:32,070
Saying that what I'm saying,

1694
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:33,480
what do you.
Are you.

1695
01:24:33,481 --> 01:24:38,481
Are you completely confident in saying 
that you understand that person's 

1696
01:24:38,481 --> 01:24:42,471
lifestyle 100 percent and you know they 
weren't doing something that you 

1697
01:24:42,471 --> 01:24:43,610
might've known about completely about.
Well,

1698
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,630
that's what I'm saying.

1699
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:50,530
Most people will tell you who lived 
through this in and doctors who are 

1700
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:54,341
involved in this will say what got these
guys sick was obviously something they 

1701
01:24:54,501 --> 01:24:59,330
caught through either gay sex through 
intravenous drug use and by the way they

1702
01:24:59,331 --> 01:25:03,830
died in a very similar way of things 
like wasting disease and pneumonia,

1703
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,440
karposi sarcoma,
terrible sores,

1704
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:09,200
all that stuff.
They were dying that way.

1705
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:15,640
Right,
but you see the issue in that like when 

1706
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,540
if someone goes and they find you when 
you're sick and then they start treating

1707
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:19,160
you when you're sick.
The the.

1708
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:24,180
The issue with that is how many people 
are hiv positive or tests for the 

1709
01:25:24,381 --> 01:25:28,610
antibody but have nothing wrong with 
them and then do no drugs.

1710
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,870
Take no,
no medication and live healthy lives and

1711
01:25:32,871 --> 01:25:36,500
then eventually get tested again and 
don't show the antibody.

1712
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:37,850
They don't show their body's fighting 
enough.

1713
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:39,440
How.
How often does that happen?

1714
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:41,730
It does happen.
there were a couple,

1715
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:46,910
for example,
there were 50 cases per year in us long 

1716
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:50,031
before hiv came and it went up to 
thousands of in the act days and so in 

1717
01:25:51,871 --> 01:25:54,050
the.
In the case when the poppers,

1718
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:59,420
poppers meaning email,
nitrates or nitrites and nitrates and 

1719
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,160
that apparently is unbelievably 
devastating to the immune system.

1720
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:02,940
It's media genic

1721
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,300
jenny.
Yeah,

1722
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:07,210
and I think.
Can I.

1723
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,440
Can I just be clear on what you're 
saying?

1724
01:26:08,441 --> 01:26:12,220
Actually you might also be saying that 
if you get the hiv virus,

1725
01:26:12,221 --> 01:26:15,340
which you can catch now,
you have it in your system.

1726
01:26:15,341 --> 01:26:20,341
If you're also doing things that are 
weakening your immune system like 

1727
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:23,881
poppers and things that's going to.
That's going to compromise your immune 

1728
01:26:23,881 --> 01:26:28,771
system to the point where you're going 
to get all these were where I suppose 

1729
01:26:28,771 --> 01:26:32,470
the hiv virus is going to create a 
situation where you're going to.

1730
01:26:32,471 --> 01:26:35,860
It will further erode your immune system
and you'll get these other diseases that

1731
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:36,150
you might

1732
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,140
daddy's.
Again,

1733
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:42,170
something that would be verY testable,
but see the cdc a not a straight or not 

1734
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:47,650
own little.
They never report pneumonias or kaposi 

1735
01:26:49,051 --> 01:26:53,210
sarcoma of hiv feep people as pneumonia 
psychosis.

1736
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:58,480
They can't do.
You have an eight statistic when you're 

1737
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,370
hiv positive,
then they report these diseases in the 

1738
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:03,870
tdc,
in engagement or in junkies that are not

1739
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,720
antibody positive,
are not even in the same journal.

1740
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:11,100
A lot of people never hear about it gets
lumped into the aids deaths.

1741
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,230
That's what they do.
That's a political decision.

1742
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:16,260
Of course,
it take hold diseases and politically.

1743
01:27:16,261 --> 01:27:19,530
how can you have a common cause for 
dementia?

1744
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:21,120
Weight loss,
fever,

1745
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,010
pneumonia,
kaposi sarcoma,

1746
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,570
dIarrhea,
leukemia,

1747
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,910
and whatever.
Wasting disease.

1748
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:32,210
It's 27 altogether from one cost for 
anything in the first place.

1749
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,560
Lumping them all altogether is nothing 
but a money grab.

1750
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,450
Did it's a mistake?
well,

1751
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:41,480
I mean money.
It's much more ego tHan money In 

1752
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:41,480
scientists.
Really?

1753
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,330
Oh yeah.
I didn't want to be famous and they want

1754
01:27:42,331 --> 01:27:44,400
to be in the history books and the 
textbooks.

1755
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:49,440
They discoVered something.
Gallo would sell his mother for a nobel 

1756
01:27:49,711 --> 01:27:50,100
prize,

1757
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:53,510
but a lot of people died.
A lot of people died of aids.

1758
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:58,540
A lot of people died.
Act only came about after people were 

1759
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:02,921
dying,
but the people that were dying were 

1760
01:28:02,921 --> 01:28:04,790
doing drugs.
That's what he's saying and I don't know

1761
01:28:04,791 --> 01:28:06,680
if you're right.
I wish I knew.

1762
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:11,681
I wish I knew what you know.
How many people out there didn't do any 

1763
01:28:11,681 --> 01:28:12,950
drugs?
Lived a normal healthy lifestyle.

1764
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,860
Word gay had sex with the wrong dude.
Boom.

1765
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,050
Died of aids.
That's what we had always heard.

1766
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:22,930
That was the story behind aids was never
the drug use until I read spin magazines

1767
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:25,490
article in [inaudible] 93.
I had never even heard it brought up.

1768
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:28,010
When I read that article about when you 
were talking about,

1769
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:28,880
I was like,
this is crazy.

1770
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:31,670
Because I had just taken my first hiv 
test.

1771
01:28:31,671 --> 01:28:35,960
I already got a health insurance and I'd
take my first hiv test and I was fucking

1772
01:28:35,961 --> 01:28:38,210
shitting me.
I took a lot of our.

1773
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,340
God,
I was terrified.

1774
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:42,620
I thought it was going to die of aids,
you know,

1775
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:44,750
I wasn't.
Dare you sir.

1776
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:46,190
That's why I.
Dave porn stars.

1777
01:28:46,191 --> 01:28:47,740
It's never done any.
Yeah,

1778
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:49,580
I've never done any.
Yeah you do.

1779
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:51,280
But they do talk about hiring high risk,

1780
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:56,280
low risk behavior and you can get the.
You can get the hiv virus from Ohio.

1781
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,720
What?
Quote unquote high risk behavior,

1782
01:28:58,721 --> 01:29:00,520
right?
Versus low risk behavior.

1783
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:02,040
How do

1784
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,740
you catch the aids virus?
It's very difficult,

1785
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:08,270
but how would you catch it saying it 
doesn't exist.

1786
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,190
No.
Aids virus.

1787
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,520
So how do you say?
How do you catch something?

1788
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:17,610
He kept saying you don't.
You don't believe there is something 

1789
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:17,720
called the hiv virus.
You said the aids virus does exist?

1790
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,250
Yeah,
but not the aids virus virus.

1791
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:22,800
There's no what you just said.
No,

1792
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:25,460
I'm sorry.
Hiv causes your immune system.

1793
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:28,490
You did not hear him say you said aids 
virus.

1794
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,800
What I meant is hiv,
which is,

1795
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:33,080
which can be construed as the aids virus
because hey,

1796
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:36,770
it's just me and acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome.

1797
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:40,430
In other words,
when you can be hiv positive,

1798
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,140
you don't have full blown aids until 
you're,

1799
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,530
you've got all kinds of stuff going on 
with obviously,

1800
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:46,340
but so,
so the,

1801
01:29:46,341 --> 01:29:49,250
the hiv virus,
how do,

1802
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:52,280
since we can test for the antibodies,
and by the way,

1803
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:57,460
a lot of people who test for the 
antibodies are what we were talking 

1804
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:57,860
about intravenous drug users,
gay men,

1805
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:03,370
uh,
and then of course in africa to 

1806
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:03,370
heterosexual disease.
Why?

1807
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:03,620
How,
how does that happen?

1808
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:06,990
How did they get that virus in the.
Why don't most straight?

1809
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:12,050
There's little known about it,
but I mean the best way to transmitted 

1810
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:14,220
is actually transfusions.
It's very difficult.

1811
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:17,490
It is,
it takes on average from the literature.

1812
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:22,820
Hemophiliacs for example,
coupled within without on the average 

1813
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:26,960
thousand unprotected contacts to convert
positive to a negative thousand.

1814
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:30,750
Wow.
That cannot be a normal way of

1815
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:36,150
keisha.
I had to say this is a very eyeopening 

1816
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:36,150
discussion.
Yeah.

1817
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:36,150
I mean,
I have to say that you,

1818
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:41,080
you know,
one thing for 25 years as we have and 

1819
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:41,160
then you come along,
you're,

1820
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,220
you're raising questions that are,
that are very,

1821
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,680
that are very interested too stupid to 
answer those questions.

1822
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:48,380
So this is the problem we're going to 
have to.

1823
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:48,970
No,
no,

1824
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:55,240
no.
I wouldn't say just uninformed to 

1825
01:30:55,861 --> 01:30:58,680
recognize that the fact that this is 
such a touchy subject,

1826
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:01,170
we're going to have to try to find some 
scientists willing to do this,

1827
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:06,320
but meanwhile we have to make sure we 
don't get trolled and some crazy desk 

1828
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,540
squad fan his way in as a fake scientist
guy.

1829
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:15,980
Yeah.
We're going to have to probably reach 

1830
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:15,980
people up and you can.
Yeah,

1831
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,100
we're probably going to have to try to 
reach out and contact someone and figure

1832
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:18,270
out what,
what the hell.

1833
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:22,080
I don't think that's the same.
What about dr drew?

1834
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:23,130
I.
Well I tried dr.

1835
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:23,790
Drew,
man.

1836
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:25,950
I brought this up to dr drew about eight
years ago.

1837
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:31,220
I've been following your work for a long
time and I brought it up to dr drew a 

1838
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:31,580
long time ago and like the last time I 
was on loveline,

1839
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:36,590
I don't even know how long ago that was,
but he dismissed it immediately without 

1840
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:38,310
even considering it and then looked at 
your,

1841
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:43,550
your,
your website for about five minutes and 

1842
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:43,550
said something was wrong there.

1843
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:43,950
And then,
uh,

1844
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:49,030
you know,
but I suspect he might be full of shit 

1845
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,030
becaUSe he's full of shit about 
marijuana.

1846
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:51,570
He's always talking about marijuana 
being unbelievably addictive,

1847
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,270
addictive syndromes.
We find it to connect to the marijuana.

1848
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:59,510
That's just not true.
The people that show anY addiction to 

1849
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:02,601
marijuana either they're unusual cases,
extremely unusual or it's a 

1850
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:05,140
psychological addiction much like 
gambling or masturbating or anything.

1851
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:08,500
So for him to,
as a doctor to spout that,

1852
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,310
you know,
most doctors study,

1853
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,510
they're very orthodox.
The medical staff,

1854
01:32:13,511 --> 01:32:14,620
by the way.
I like dr drew.

1855
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:16,180
He's a great guy.
Don't get me wrong.

1856
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:17,430
I just think the,
you know,

1857
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:20,290
people get an idea in their head and 
they rock with it.

1858
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:22,510
And his idea is that sobriety is the 
only way to go,

1859
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,230
but as,
as a,

1860
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:28,231
as a doctor and as a surgeon,
when you start talking about nutrition 

1861
01:32:28,231 --> 01:32:28,231
to your colleagues and they don't know 
what the fuck they're talking about,

1862
01:32:28,231 --> 01:32:28,780
it's taboo.

1863
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:31,210
It's a orthodoxy is of,
correct me if I'm wrong,

1864
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:33,400
is forced on you in the medical 
establishment.

1865
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,420
Well,
not only that,

1866
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:39,421
the amount of nutrition information that
they're given during medical school is 

1867
01:32:39,421 --> 01:32:39,830
so minimal and constantly changing.
Yeah,

1868
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:45,160
no,
there's constant studies that are going 

1869
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:45,160
on.
I remember,

1870
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,270
you know when,
when people have a certain amount of 

1871
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:51,640
knowledge in their field and they don't 
keep up and the time goes by 10,

1872
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:56,650
20 years,
like you might as well be the average 

1873
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:56,650
person on the street like you,
you know,

1874
01:32:56,650 --> 01:33:01,141
shit from 20 years ago things have 
changed radically the way it is.

1875
01:33:01,901 --> 01:33:06,901
If you look at the ufc in [inaudible] 93
and look at what people knew then and 

1876
01:33:06,901 --> 01:33:09,720
they look at what people know today,
day out now it's like,

1877
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:14,980
well,
I love watching it just because it's so 

1878
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:14,980
nostalgic,
but it's.

1879
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,150
It's an unbelievable example of how 
things have gotten super,

1880
01:33:16,151 --> 01:33:17,050
super complicated.

1881
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:17,980
super,
super quickly.

1882
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:23,190
duck duesberg.
Did you know that Colorado and 

1883
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:24,100
Washington state made marijuana legal?
That's about time.

1884
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:25,330
Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah.

1885
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,020
They stepped up yesterday.
Oregon fucked up Though.

1886
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:30,960
Oregon.
So sad for you.

1887
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:32,410
Portland.
How dare you?

1888
01:33:32,411 --> 01:33:37,411
I dare you let that happen because 
Oregon is filled with a lot of white 

1889
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:38,200
gangsters out.
Chill son and type dudes out there.

1890
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:39,680
Oh boy.
So they never like.

1891
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:41,750
They're not down with these fucking 
hippies work.

1892
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:42,790
Go to work.
Hippie.

1893
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:46,960
I'm just kidding.
But Oregon didn't pass it,

1894
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:50,540
but Colorado did is legal I guess.
Huh?

1895
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:53,200
Medical marijuana passed in 
Massachusetts.

1896
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:58,770
Well,
what is the federal government going to 

1897
01:33:58,770 --> 01:33:58,770
do?
They can it exactly.

1898
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:02,040
Well,
they're not going to shut down the 

1899
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:02,040
medical marijuana programs.
The dea might occasionally bus people,

1900
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:06,331
encourage people to not do it.
Threatened landlords and stuff like 

1901
01:34:06,331 --> 01:34:06,331
that.
but it's really just essentially to keep

1902
01:34:06,331 --> 01:34:10,981
their business open with the da has been
been down to doing is they re these 

1903
01:34:11,051 --> 01:34:13,210
medical marijuana dispensary,
they take all their weed,

1904
01:34:13,211 --> 01:34:18,211
they take all their cash,
they say they're going to process the 

1905
01:34:18,211 --> 01:34:18,211
information and then they never do 
anything.

1906
01:34:18,211 --> 01:34:22,590
So they basically just go in and crank 
everybody the gangsta cash they go in 

1907
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:26,500
with strapped with machine guns and ddh 
agathy step on people's necks.

1908
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:28,450
I mean it's fucked up.
It's a jacking.

1909
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:33,660
They go in there,
they take all the weedy tickle them and 

1910
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:33,760
they can by federal law they can't 
prosecute,

1911
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:37,450
but yet they just sort of hold that case
up and they don't do anything about it.

1912
01:34:37,451 --> 01:34:42,451
And occasionally people get prosecuted 
when they find out that they're doing 

1913
01:34:42,451 --> 01:34:43,000
something like this is a lot of dudes 
who got into the weed business that used

1914
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:44,950
to be in the illegal business,
you know?

1915
01:34:44,951 --> 01:34:47,590
And so they're doing shit shady and guys
get busted,

1916
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:50,080
you know,
selling mass quantity taxes on it.

1917
01:34:50,081 --> 01:34:55,081
But with the real problem is you got a 
bunch of guys in the dea that would 

1918
01:34:55,081 --> 01:34:58,141
probably like to go bust scumbags and 
probably like to actually make a dent in

1919
01:34:58,701 --> 01:35:03,701
their community and they're in a 
situation where something is law and 

1920
01:35:03,701 --> 01:35:03,701
here's the law.

1921
01:35:03,701 --> 01:35:04,810
The law is they're doing something.
They have to go do it.

1922
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:07,970
They have to do something.
It's like until you change the law,

1923
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:13,030
you have law enforcement officers.
They're going to be wanting to enforce 

1924
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:13,280
the law period.
It's a simple written thing.

1925
01:35:13,281 --> 01:35:15,980
It's written down.
Most laws are stupid as fuck.

1926
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:21,010
But the we agree on them on them.
And that's their job comes prostitution.

1927
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,480
Sure they do.
They hate,

1928
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:28,130
they hate having to give people speeding
tickets to sit there with a laser gun.

1929
01:35:28,131 --> 01:35:29,870
That's not what they signed up to be a 
cop for.

1930
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:34,990
But it's part of the job.
But we have to do is make it so that 

1931
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:35,180
it's not part of the fucking job and 
give them,

1932
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:40,650
you know,
it's like the difference between going 

1933
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:42,791
to a medical marijuana dispensary and 
stepping on some kid's neck who's a 

1934
01:35:42,791 --> 01:35:46,241
college student who just got in because 
he was high and took the job and going 

1935
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:47,750
to a meth lab is a very different 
experience.

1936
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:48,350
You know,
you,

1937
01:35:48,351 --> 01:35:53,351
you drive out into the middle of fucking
palmdale and you see a warehouse with 

1938
01:35:53,351 --> 01:35:55,580
smoke coming out of it and you all storm
the building from email.

1939
01:35:55,581 --> 01:35:57,920
You might go into a bomb man.
You might go into,

1940
01:35:57,921 --> 01:36:02,921
somebody might drop some biker gangs,
hopefully machine guns out of their head

1941
01:36:03,771 --> 01:36:05,870
making shitty decisions being up for a 
week.

1942
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,850
Yeah,
it's dangerous as fuck.

1943
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:12,940
Whereas they can go to a medical 
marijuana dispensary and just walk in 

1944
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:12,940
and,
you know,

1945
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:15,350
go take everybody's money and take your 
business and scare the shit out of them.

1946
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:20,500
It's not the da's fault,
the dea or a bunch of guys that are 

1947
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,920
fucking dea agents,
which if you're going to have like a 

1948
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,340
regular society,
you got to recognize what's dangerous.

1949
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:27,710
And the regular site,
but a healthy society,

1950
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:30,290
you've got to realize what's actually 
dangerous and what's not.

1951
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,480
I'm not saying things should be illegal.

1952
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:35,150
I'm not saying you should go to jail for
doing anything,

1953
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:39,770
but I'm saying there should be certain 
consequences for knowingly and willfully

1954
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:44,980
pushing addictive and dangerous drugs on
people like math.

1955
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:50,140
There should be a social consequence for
it and that's where something like the 

1956
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:52,670
dea should come into play to restrict 
shit like that district.

1957
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,430
When you get that shit into communities,
it poisons people.

1958
01:36:55,431 --> 01:37:00,431
It infects just like a disease.
There should be massive amounts of 

1959
01:37:00,621 --> 01:37:03,350
resources spent trying to stop that from
happening.

1960
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:05,030
I don't know exactly how you should do 
it,

1961
01:37:05,031 --> 01:37:09,260
but having a dea is not a bad thing.
Having an agency,

1962
01:37:09,261 --> 01:37:10,880
just like we were talking about,
the fish and game,

1963
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:14,630
they regulate the wildlife and they do a
great job.

1964
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:19,870
There could be a way of regulating the 
effect of dangerous substances on the 

1965
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:24,241
american population because right now 
they're dealing with this whole bath 

1966
01:37:24,241 --> 01:37:27,131
salt issue man,
which is a real problem because they're 

1967
01:37:27,131 --> 01:37:27,131
just taking a drug.
You got to go to the bathroom,

1968
01:37:27,131 --> 01:37:27,131
sir.

1969
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,010
You wanted to work,
going to get an article.

1970
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:36,370
The bath salts thing is they're taking 
drugs and they just change one molecule 

1971
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:41,740
and they can say not for human 
consumption and sell it over the 

1972
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:41,740
counter.
Everywhere you're.

1973
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:43,500
There's an outlet that's not illegal.
They can't.

1974
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:46,460
They can't even do anything about that.
So they have to pass drugs for those and

1975
01:37:46,461 --> 01:37:51,461
then they just keep changing what the 
drug is instead of calling it bath 

1976
01:37:51,461 --> 01:37:51,890
salts,
fucking garage sand call called whatever

1977
01:37:51,891 --> 01:37:56,891
the fuck you want.
As long as You say it's not for human 

1978
01:37:56,891 --> 01:37:56,891
consumption,
you know,

1979
01:37:56,891 --> 01:37:57,410
lawn fertilizer,
decoration,

1980
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:02,420
make some shit up.
You could sell it all day long and 

1981
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:04,950
people figure out that it's there for 
you to smoke and get high and it's just 

1982
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:05,100
like a meth with something changed on 
share.

1983
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:10,250
So having a dea is not a bad idea.
Having drugs like marijuana to be 

1984
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:11,480
illegal is the bad idea.

1985
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,230
It's a bad idea.
yeah.

1986
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:18,510
Fucking government is.
The problem is there's too many people 

1987
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:22,460
and trying to manage 300 million people.
Ridiculous and trying to manage it by 

1988
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:27,210
having government nanny groups that 
stopped you from doing a bunch of shit.

1989
01:38:27,211 --> 01:38:32,211
That doesn't hurt anybody.
Well now you're just going to ruin the 

1990
01:38:32,211 --> 01:38:34,791
listening to you about anything because 
I don't want to listen to you about 

1991
01:38:34,791 --> 01:38:34,791
that.
You know,

1992
01:38:34,791 --> 01:38:38,211
the marijuana argument is one of the 
main reasons why people have a distrust 

1993
01:38:38,211 --> 01:38:41,031
of cops.
It's not about crime stopping or 

1994
01:38:41,031 --> 01:38:41,670
anything else.
It's like the idea that I could be doing

1995
01:38:41,671 --> 01:38:46,671
something that I love doing and I got to
look out for cops because if I get 

1996
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:47,040
busted doing something I love doing.
That hurts nolan.

1997
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:50,850
I might wind up spending the night in a 
cage somewhere with a bunch of criminals

1998
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:55,810
can get you can get fall down drunk at a
bar and,

1999
01:38:55,811 --> 01:38:57,360
and,
and that somehow.

2000
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:02,780
Exactly.
You can throw up into a garbage barrel 

2001
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:03,420
like many of us have done,
you know,

2002
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:07,420
just a bunch of wind literally poisoned 
by and people.

2003
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,480
People applaud it.
Dude,

2004
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:11,070
I got so fucked up.
I threw up in the curb.

2005
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:14,280
You,
it's so bad for you.

2006
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:19,281
It's so stupid and it's everywhere and 
nobody's complaining and there's all 

2007
01:39:19,281 --> 01:39:22,380
these stupid people working so hard keep
marijuana illegal,

2008
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,780
but we need to do is find jobs for those
fucking people.

2009
01:39:24,781 --> 01:39:29,781
That's what we need to do.
We need to have a compassIonate way of 

2010
01:39:29,781 --> 01:39:32,871
looking at drug legalization and one of 
the ways is looking at the people that 

2011
01:39:32,871 --> 01:39:36,501
are making a living from drug 
illegalizing drugs being illegal and go 

2012
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:42,171
after those people with positivity and 
figure out a way to where they can make 

2013
01:39:42,171 --> 01:39:45,771
a better living to transfer the people 
in the dea that are responsible for 

2014
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,740
going after marijuana and find fucking 
better use for them.

2015
01:39:49,970 --> 01:39:54,970
Actually put them in in some sort of a 
positive function in the community 

2016
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:57,660
instead of being monetary vampires.
That's what they're doing there.

2017
01:39:57,670 --> 01:40:02,670
They're jumping in and stealing money 
and then suck it into their system and 

2018
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:05,040
nobody can ever get it back and there's 
no case and nothing ever happens.

2019
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:10,700
It's not sense.
That's just like a gang stealing your 

2020
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:13,821
stash.
That's all that is and that it does 

2021
01:40:13,821 --> 01:40:13,821
affect a government's credibility.
Of course it does.

2022
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:18,890
It does when it's marijuana,
because you can't act like it's 1950 

2023
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:19,350
anymore.
It's 2012.

2024
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:24,351
Everybody can get on their phone and 
they can google something and five 

2025
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:24,640
minutes and read all the bullet in my,
you know,

2026
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:27,360
they might called schizophrenia in the 
who,

2027
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:30,960
who's taken it and go and schizophrenia.
It might be a schizophrenia.

2028
01:40:30,961 --> 01:40:35,961
I also smoked weed.
You know what you're doing and you're 

2029
01:40:35,961 --> 01:40:37,290
giVing 10 people fake weed and 10 people
real weed.

2030
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:42,470
What are you talking about?
Even with all the pressure to make 

2031
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:42,470
marijuana,
you know,

2032
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:45,360
to make it a dangerous substance.
They still can't find shit,

2033
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:50,900
but yet it's illegal there.
This is an embarrassment as a human 

2034
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:54,741
race.
I think that the elections are showing 

2035
01:40:54,741 --> 01:40:54,741
that,
right?

2036
01:40:54,741 --> 01:40:56,860
It's too fucking states out of 50 and 
one had failed.

2037
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:02,200
It was on the ballot.
Momentum is moving forward in that 

2038
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:02,200
direction.
It is.

2039
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,000
It has to be hard to justify.
Like I always say,

2040
01:41:04,001 --> 01:41:09,001
I'm not even a big weed smoker.
It's just hard to justify how you make 

2041
01:41:09,001 --> 01:41:10,450
alcoholic alcohol illegal.
I'm a big way.

2042
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:15,840
I like the way.
That's the problem also is that people 

2043
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,850
getting uneducated views on weed.
People think potheads lazy.

2044
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:20,410
It was because there's two different 
kinds of effects.

2045
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:25,590
There's the endeca effect,
which is just like sleepy couchy affair 

2046
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:25,590
because I don't like that.

2047
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:26,980
I go with the sativa.
Look,

2048
01:41:26,990 --> 01:41:31,990
if it was only in the weed,
I would still smoke it every now and 

2049
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:35,161
then when you wanted to chill,
have a nice meal hanging out with my 

2050
01:41:35,161 --> 01:41:35,161
lady,
my lady I said,

2051
01:41:35,161 --> 01:41:37,490
or like a black man.
No irony whatsoever.

2052
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:39,670
Hang on lady.
My special lady.

2053
01:41:39,671 --> 01:41:42,790
You know what I'm saying,
but I much prefer sativa.

2054
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:47,791
Sativa is what you have before you have 
an interesting conversation or I have 

2055
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:51,781
energy on that stuff.
It's a different effect and it's not a 

2056
01:41:51,781 --> 01:41:54,241
lazy effect and the reason why people 
don't know is because we're in a 

2057
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:58,410
terrible situation where we have a bunch
of uneducated or uninformed people that 

2058
01:41:58,410 --> 01:42:03,121
are dictating policy.
They're looking at things in the wrong 

2059
01:42:03,121 --> 01:42:03,121
way.
These things are tools.

2060
01:42:03,121 --> 01:42:04,690
All these things are tools are there to 
help us.

2061
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:09,990
We deserve help us.
They finally figured that out in two 

2062
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:09,990
states,
Colorado,

2063
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,380
which has always been ahead of the curve
and Washington state,

2064
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:12,340
which is seattle,
was.

2065
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:17,460
I did the more theater this weekend.
I seriously think about where we're 

2066
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:18,070
going to move for at least part of the 
year.

2067
01:42:18,071 --> 01:42:22,060
Colorado man and wife.
The wife has family from there.

2068
01:42:22,061 --> 01:42:27,061
I used to live.
I'll move back to Colorado in a 

2069
01:42:27,061 --> 01:42:27,061
heartbeat when the shit hits the fan.
Redbands.

2070
01:42:27,061 --> 01:42:28,240
ready?
You're ready to move to Colorado.

2071
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:30,190
He's ready.
He's ready.

2072
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:36,240
Dr duesberg,
would you be our scientific advisory in 

2073
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,371
Colorado?
Post post apocalypse because when the 

2074
01:42:38,371 --> 01:42:40,240
scientist on,
we'll go get some cocaine and smoke some

2075
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:42,990
weed burger,
be in his underwear,

2076
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:46,780
fucking shooting guns off the roof.
Crazy german.

2077
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,170
My.
Hey,

2078
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,950
listen,
doses gluten.

2079
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:56,140
There's.
It's very unfortunate that your story 

2080
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:58,891
is,
is a fascinating one and you know brian 

2081
01:42:58,891 --> 01:43:01,561
and I have really struggled with this.
We've had this conversation without you 

2082
01:43:01,561 --> 01:43:05,101
here many times and neither one of us 
really qualified to have it.

2083
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,400
So to to have you here and to talk about
this crazy subject.

2084
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:13,530
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of 
people that are responding to this in a 

2085
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:14,570
bunch of very different ways.
Yeah.

2086
01:43:14,810 --> 01:43:16,240
Yeah.
There's people listening now.

2087
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:19,220
No,
we don't want them to call.

2088
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,650
They would get crazy and just yell out 
or have gardened,

2089
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:26,630
butthole and hangups when.
Well,

2090
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:30,850
there's for sure a lot of twitter people
will react on twitter.

2091
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:33,430
Are you on twitter?
I'll sometimes look at it.

2092
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:35,830
You do you have an account?
What is it?

2093
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,740
I don't even know.
I don't.

2094
01:43:37,950 --> 01:43:39,100
Oh,
you just read people's.

2095
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:40,840
What's we need to start you at twitter 
account.

2096
01:43:40,841 --> 01:43:42,380
Were you done with that?
Fine.

2097
01:43:42,490 --> 01:43:43,690
Brian.
See if he could find them on twitter.

2098
01:43:43,691 --> 01:43:44,520
Name.
There you go.

2099
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:45,270
What,
what,

2100
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:49,150
what's your uh,
website duesberg do you e s,

2101
01:43:49,151 --> 01:43:50,920
b e r g.org,
right?

2102
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:52,350
Correct.
Com.com.

2103
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,170
Dot com.
Did you used to be.org?

2104
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:58,960
This one org for the academy?
Yeah.

2105
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:03,550
And um,
if people want to read more about this,

2106
01:44:03,551 --> 01:44:06,400
is that the best resource resource to 
speak on?

2107
01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:09,780
Duesberg duisburg on aids.
The book websIte.

2108
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:10,720
Oh,
it's a website.

2109
01:44:10,721 --> 01:44:15,721
Duesberg on aids.com.
Is there a book that you've written 

2110
01:44:15,721 --> 01:44:18,550
about it and I wanted to bring you a 
copy.

2111
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:23,640
She's inventing the aids virus and is 
that available on amazon?

2112
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:26,970
All that for me.
I signed it for you.

2113
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:28,460
You know,
you're a very brave man.

2114
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:29,840
Uh,
I don't know if you're right.

2115
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:31,610
I said,
it sounds like you are,

2116
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:36,760
but I'm too stupid.
And if we had a guy here was equally 

2117
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:36,760
bright,
who opposed you,

2118
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:37,590
I would be baffled and stuck in the 
middle.

2119
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,810
We'd both be like,
well,

2120
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:39,620
I don't,
you know,

2121
01:44:39,621 --> 01:44:40,040
it's,
it's,

2122
01:44:40,041 --> 01:44:42,900
uh,
but it's what you've done in this belief

2123
01:44:42,901 --> 01:44:44,450
and that you're right,
is a very,

2124
01:44:44,451 --> 01:44:47,990
a very brave thing and it's,
it's an interesting story and it's,

2125
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:53,100
I've never really quite understood the 
whole academic process and what's 

2126
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:53,610
involved and only like,
you know,

2127
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:55,660
looked at it from the outside.
So to,

2128
01:44:55,661 --> 01:45:00,661
uh,
to hear you describing what it's been 

2129
01:45:00,661 --> 01:45:02,711
like trying to,
trying to make an argument for this and 

2130
01:45:02,711 --> 01:45:04,490
being treated in what seems to be an 
unscientific way.

2131
01:45:04,491 --> 01:45:07,130
It seems to be a biased and,
and,

2132
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:08,440
and really,
uh,

2133
01:45:08,441 --> 01:45:12,530
uh,
in a way that's actually damaging to the

2134
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:16,130
distribution of information because you,
there should be,

2135
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:18,920
if you are a respected scientist,
which you are,

2136
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:21,740
there should be some concerted effort to
prove you wrong.

2137
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:23,180
There should be some,
like,

2138
01:45:23,181 --> 01:45:25,520
it seems like you've made enough waves 
with your book.

2139
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:30,550
You're,
you're in a prestigious enough position 

2140
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:30,550
at the university of California,
berkeley,

2141
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:33,970
that you should be considered and at 
least refuted by the people that 

2142
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:35,030
continue.
Instead of doing that,

2143
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:36,170
they've decided to ignore you.

2144
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:41,820
Yeah.
Judy's underhanded things like 

2145
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:43,490
underhanded tongues,
like a misconduct investigation,

2146
01:45:43,491 --> 01:45:45,530
which is pretty heavy.
So when did they do that?

2147
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:48,230
It was a one and a half years ago until 
they hear about the cocaine.

2148
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:53,231
You're doing coke with students that I 
think that's a podcast well,

2149
01:45:54,621 --> 01:45:58,810
st in to sink your ship.
If the statue of limitation expired.

2150
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,210
Yeah,
those were hippies.

2151
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:05,340
Man.
You've got old days back when it wasn't 

2152
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:05,340
even illegal.
Boy,

2153
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:09,250
was there a time.
Do you remember the time when cocaine 

2154
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:09,250
wasn't illegal?
Remember that?

2155
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:10,810
When was that?
Was that the seventies now?

2156
01:46:10,811 --> 01:46:11,780
I was,
it was illegal.

2157
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:12,930
It was,
it,

2158
01:46:12,931 --> 01:46:16,700
it was before,
I think in the forties or thirties.

2159
01:46:16,701 --> 01:46:18,800
Twenties in the first part of the last 
century.

2160
01:46:18,801 --> 01:46:19,660
It was legal.
Yeah,

2161
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:24,670
because you took a coke coca cola.
In fact he took a.

2162
01:46:26,001 --> 01:46:27,680
You get a buzz off coke.
Yeah.

2163
01:46:27,681 --> 01:46:30,620
That was the old days.
Cocaine in coding,

2164
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:34,220
whIch is a date assuming that by your 
meat can cuff,

2165
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:36,950
was made illegal in 19.
Oh seven.

2166
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:38,540
Damn.
They figured out.

2167
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:40,840
Coke is bad for you in 19.
oh seven.

2168
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,230
You take it once and you're like,
oh,

2169
01:46:42,231 --> 01:46:45,480
this can't be good in the world is you 
don't do anything.

2170
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:47,630
You just sit in her room.
Yeah.

2171
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:49,880
The us government.
Uh,

2172
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,370
the

2173
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,060
first effort from the us government to 
control cocaine was the inclusion of the

2174
01:46:54,061 --> 01:46:57,570
pure food and drug act effective January
1st 19.

2175
01:46:57,571 --> 01:46:57,990
Oh,
seven.

2176
01:46:57,991 --> 01:47:01,200
Which required the labeling of products 
to disclose the contents,

2177
01:47:01,201 --> 01:47:02,520
including alcohol,
morphine,

2178
01:47:02,521 --> 01:47:03,690
opium,
cocaine,

2179
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,470
heroin,
alpha or beta.

2180
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,050
So what it essentially is saying that,
oh,

2181
01:47:08,051 --> 01:47:09,120
cannabis,
much different things,

2182
01:47:09,121 --> 01:47:13,590
but there was no labeling back then.
So that was the first effort.

2183
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:15,600
So it wasn't necessarily that they are 
making it illegal,

2184
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:20,720
but they let you know.
So the comprehensive drug abuse 

2185
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,590
prevention and control act passed.
And in 1970,

2186
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:26,740
that's when a cocaine saturday only.
Yeah,

2187
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:30,840
they regulated and taxed opiate and 
heroin in 1915.

2188
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:34,570
But it wasn't until 1970.
So what's You're saying is true that the

2189
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:39,090
after the post Vietnam war,
those people from that era fourth,

2190
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,940
that's when the real drug problem 
started in America.

2191
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,740
And in nineTeen 70,
that's when,

2192
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:45,860
that's when they cracked down on all the
psychedelics.

2193
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:49,790
That's when you know mushrooms and acid 
and everything else became law,

2194
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:54,800
which is incredible.
Can you think that all those years 

2195
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,961
before that,
even though marijuana has been illegal 

2196
01:47:56,961 --> 01:47:57,060
since the thirties asset and mushrooms 
and all that shit,

2197
01:47:57,090 --> 01:48:02,090
they were illegal until 19 crazy.
No other music was so good,

2198
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:03,930
man.
No wonder,

2199
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:09,370
no wonder the beatles were as lonely 
dude.

2200
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:14,580
They were in tune.
You can't make the doors with the white 

2201
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:16,560
album.
Crazy album man door songs like,

2202
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,630
father,
i'M going to kill you.

2203
01:48:18,631 --> 01:48:20,350
You,
you're not going to make that.

2204
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:23,460
And I'll say it also ensures you die.
At 27,

2205
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,070
every one of them.
Oh yeah,

2206
01:48:26,071 --> 01:48:27,810
they fucked hendrix.
Joplin,

2207
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:30,450
jim morrison.
Certainly not good for you,

2208
01:48:30,451 --> 01:48:33,220
but neither is aids.
They died of aids essentially.

2209
01:48:33,221 --> 01:48:35,500

2210
01:48:35,501 --> 01:48:38,390
It's ready man.

Thank you very much sir.

2214
01:48:42,811 --> 01:48:47,450
It's been a pleasure having you on.
Fascinating and enlightening and uh,

2215
01:48:47,451 --> 01:48:49,460
you,
you opened a lot of people's eyes and,

2216
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,390
and confuse the shit out of a lot of 
others.

2217
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:56,450
So I'm sure we're going to.

response from a legitimate scientist is 
willing to sit down next to a zombie 

2219
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:04,671
puppet and a mannequin victims and we'll
try to put this together and,

2220
01:49:04,801 --> 01:49:09,801
uh,
and bring you back and hopefully we can 

2221
01:49:09,801 --> 01:49:09,801
shed some light on this.
This is very,

2222
01:49:09,801 --> 01:49:09,801
