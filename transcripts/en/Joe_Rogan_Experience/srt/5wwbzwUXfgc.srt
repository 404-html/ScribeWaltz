1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,713
Nope.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,730
Well,
Joe Rogan experience.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,020
She's my favorite.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,000
Mr Antonopoulos now you prefer
to not go buy bitcoin Jesus.

5
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,390
Is that correct? I do. I don't
like the end date of that story.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,750
It doesn't turn out so
good for it comes back.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,530
Well that's one version because the
problem with the Jesus story, right?

8
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:31,350
He comes back and then you don't
hear from him again. I quit him.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,730
What the fuck happened there?

10
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:37,350
The guy comes back from the dead after
three days and then nothing. You know,

11
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:40,650
I even,
so the tortured to death part for,

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,340
for poking a steak at the big bad bear
of the Roman Empire is a bad enough story

13
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:51,480
as it is. I don't want to emulate any
part of that. Thank you. I agree with you.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,700
Also the misuse of magic.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,710
I mean to have like all that power and
to just like work on wine. You know,

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,430
I'm turning water into wine and
walking on water and stuff like that.

17
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:05,200
Like it seems like some other
things could have been done. Oh,

18
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,370
perhaps combining those two,
walking on wine,

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,270
they go like converting the
entire Sea of Galilee into wine.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,370
I would have been a Shitty, awesome. Uh,

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,070
that would have been rude as fuck to all
those fish that live in there though.

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,060
It's just marinate them. It can be thrown
off to the grill right away by gas.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,960
Delicious.
They didn't have refrigeration back then.

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,520
We're getting way off topic way early.
For those of you who don't know,

25
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:32,890
Mister Antonopoulos is
an expert in Bitcoin,

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,990
in digital currencies,
in what is most likely going to be,

27
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,710
in my opinion,
the future of economics.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,400
I really do believe that this is not just,

29
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,740
I think what we're seeing
right now is not just a trend.

30
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,770
I think what we're seeing right now is
the beginnings of what will eventually be

31
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:56,901
a realization of what
I think people don't,

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,120
people don't need this third party system.
They don't need banks. They don't need,

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,073
well we need is,

34
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,160
we need to figure out some sort of a
way to exchange goods and services with

35
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:12,161
each other and to keep track of like what
things costs and right now we're doing

36
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:14,180
it with money and right now
we're doing it with money.

37
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:18,440
That's like somehow or another being
controlled by the World Bank being

38
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:21,080
controlled by the national
or the Federal Reserve.

39
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,360
And most people agree that that sucks,
that, that that system is not a,

40
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,320
it's not a fair or
equitable system and uh,

41
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,580
you're working very hard to try to alert
people about bitcoin and spread the

42
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:37,300
word. And I think you're
doing a pretty good job of it.

43
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,840
I think that the word
is getting out there.

44
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,020
I don't think I really need
to do much. Uh, that's,

45
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:45,950
that's the wonderful thing about marketing
or trying to talk about something

46
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:49,730
that's actually useful. Like if I
was selling hydraulic fracturing,

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,420
I'd have to really try hard to persuade
people that it's not fucking up the

48
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:57,050
environment.
But with bitcoin it's really useful money.

49
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,980
It can solve a lot of problems.
All I have to do

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,840
is introduce the concept and young
people, you know, the idea, hey,

51
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,580
we're going to put money on
the Internet. What, what?

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,730
Of course we're going to put money
on the Internet. Makes perfect sense.

53
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,940
And we're going to make it cold bowl and
it's going to work without borders and

54
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,820
it's going to be instantaneous.
Well, uh, of course, you know,

55
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,000
how come we haven't done that yet?
Um,

56
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,310
and so it's an easy idea to sell.

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,461
Well the system,

58
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:27,461
if for folks who haven't heard your
earlier podcasts that we did and they not

59
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:30,200
familiar with what bitcoin is,

60
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,970
just give them a brief description
of how the bitcoin system works.

61
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,880
So at a very basic level,
bitcoin is internet money.

62
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:42,550
It's money that you can send like an
email. It's like Skype for money. Um,

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,400
you can create an account if you like.
It's kind of like an account,

64
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,940
but it's basically an application that
you download onto your phone or your

65
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:53,820
desktop.
And once you do that,

66
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:56,780
you have a bitcoin address and you can
send and receive bitcoin and it's a car

67
00:03:56,781 --> 00:04:00,870
and currency works like a foreign
currency and you can convert dollars to

68
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:03,200
bitcoin and bitcoin to dollars impact.
But the,

69
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,810
the really cool thing is that you can
send bitcoin to anybody else in the world

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,770
in a matter of seconds
for almost no fees at all.

71
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:11,970
And if you do have to pay a fee,

72
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:15,780
it's like usually something like a third
of a penny and it has nothing to do

73
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:18,660
with how much you're sending
and in a few seconds cheaply,

74
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:21,600
securely all around the world,
instantaneous money. So it,

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,720
it takes money from a technology of
the 50s and it drags it into the 21st

76
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,100
century kicking and screaming.

77
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,630
It would just so we can get past this,
um,

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,800
just explain how it's created
and explain like how it's,

79
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,500
how it's controlled,
like how the,

80
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:45,501
the number of bitcoins is generated and
how this is not something that can be

81
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:50,220
fucked with the same way money is fuck
with today where they can just print

82
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:54,180
money and cause debt and
create a lot of problems.

83
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,403
Explain that.

84
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,990
So bitcoin is a decentralized peer to
peer network of money and that's a lot of

85
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:04,890
fancy words, but I'll relate it to
things that people are familiar with,

86
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:08,520
especially for younger generation and
things like bit torrent or Napster or

87
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:12,720
things like that where you run a piece
of software in your computer and that's

88
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:16,470
simultaneously using resources but
also sharing resources for others.

89
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,130
And the network is made up of everybody
running a bit of software on the

90
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:22,530
computer and coming together
in a collaborative way.

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,840
A bitcoin is money done that way.

92
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,870
So everybody runs some software and
the collaboration of everybody on the

93
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:35,481
network to run this software to secure
and verify all of the transactions that

94
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:37,134
is happening,

95
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,670
that also produces the currency and the
currency is produced at a predictable

96
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:42,840
rate.
So every 10 minutes,

97
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,620
25 bitcoin are created and the created
on the network by the network and they're

98
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,100
created through this,
uh,

99
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,320
kind of like a competition that
happens online with computing.

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,850
Power will go into too of that detail.
But the point is every toy,

101
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,070
every 10 minutes,
25 new bitcoin are created.

102
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:04,850
And then that happens for about four
years and then after four years,

103
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,820
the rate of new bitcoin is caught by half.

104
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:10,850
So when first started it was
50 bitcoins every 10 minutes.

105
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,320
Now it's 25 in the year 2016 it's
going to drop to 12 and a half.

106
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:19,060
Then it's going to go to six and a
quarter and it keeps reducing by half and

107
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,080
till eventually no more
bitcoin are created.

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,820
And if you do the math and you add up the
years and you keep dividing by two you

109
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:30,821
end up with about 21 million bitcoin and
most of them will be done in the first

110
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:33,554
decade.

111
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,860
But then that lasts small
percentage takes a very long time.

112
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,900
The last one is in the year 2141 if
you just project out by that point,

113
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:46,130
of course the world has changed,

114
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:50,180
but if you just run that equation
and so 21 million Bitcoin,

115
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,100
that's all you can ever have.
And the,

116
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,370
the interesting thing about that is
that it changes people's behavior.

117
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,220
If you know how much money is going to
exist in the system, you, you value,

118
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:02,750
it's differently. Like right now, if the
Federal Reserve had a meeting on Friday,

119
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,270
no one in the world except for the people
on the Federal Reserve Committee. No.

120
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,620
What's going to happen with money is
the Monday after you have no visibility.

121
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,310
They might say we're not going to print
another trillion dollars and all of the

122
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:20,300
money you have in your pocket
is now worth, you know, a
10th of a percentage less.

123
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,560
Or they might say we're not gonna print
anything next year and suddenly your

124
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:27,280
valley eat the value for money is
going to change. But with Bitcoin,

125
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,100
I can tell you exactly how much bitcoin
is going to be around two decades.

126
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,960
No. Now since you got
involved with good point,

127
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,660
what if any,

128
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,520
change in perception have you
seen in the public? Like the, the,

129
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:46,840
the initial idea of Bitcoin for a lot
of people was like, wait a minute,

130
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,350
what are you guys can't do? You
have digital. Like people like, hmm,

131
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,370
but now you're seeing more and more
people use it. Tiger direct uses it.

132
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:57,510
You could buy computers from them.
Does Dell use it now as well? Well,

133
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,280
Dell and more importantly,

134
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:02,520
the most recent announcement to about a
month and a half or two months ago was

135
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,300
paypal.
Paypal is now going full bitcoin.

136
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,890
They're going to offer a bitcoin
as a payment mechanism for paypal.

137
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,460
That's pretty intense,
which is a pretty huge,

138
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:13,110
as I did not expect that
was going to happen. I was,

139
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,520
I was thinking maybe in a year or two it
happened a lot faster than I expected.

140
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:21,630
That's pretty intense. That's paypal
and square of course. What is square?

141
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,960
The square is the little thing you stick
on top of an iPhone to swipe a card

142
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:29,130
with and they have square market. They've
been doing bitcoin now for six months.

143
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,230
Wow. And that's expanding. So in terms of
retail shopping, it's moving pretty well.

144
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,990
But you know, as you probably remember
from our previous discussions,

145
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:39,840
retail shopping isn't where
I think it's really powerful,

146
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,090
but it's great to see these advancements.
Um,

147
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,440
a lot of interesting things are happening.
The perception is also shifting. Uh,

148
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,150
at first, um, you know,

149
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:53,151
bitcoin was so obscure that the only
people who talk about it worth a complete

150
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:57,240
lunatic fringe likes the,
the nerds, the people.

151
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,990
No one understands that the party and in
any case they don't really talk to us.

152
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:05,700
So, um, so that's the, there was the
lunatic fringe. Now we've upgraded a,

153
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,910
now people think that bitcoin
is all about a drug dealers,

154
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:11,370
terrorists and pornographer.
So we're making some progress here.

155
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,310
How does that happen?
Well, you know, I mean,

156
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
what do you think the
media is going to focus on?

157
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:19,740
Do you think they're going to focus on
the fact that most bitcoin is charitable

158
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,710
giving donations and tipping
something you experienced too with,

159
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,100
with the donations to, um, uh,

160
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,610
to the address you showed to the
last show? A lot of that's going on,

161
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:34,611
but then also what's going on is things
like Silk Road and the media really

162
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:37,740
loves that kind of story.
You're not going to say, well,

163
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,670
people are raising charitable
donations on the Internet. No,

164
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,260
they're going to say people are buying
cocaine on the internets and that's a

165
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:44,310
much better headline.

166
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,730
So we went from completely obscure to
mostly negative press and now you're

167
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:54,630
beginning to see people say, yeah, you
know, there's more to it than that.

168
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,070
And I think the public perception is
gradually changing because primarily they

169
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:02,640
hear about it more and more in,
in a better context.

170
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,760
Yeah. We, we wound up sending thousands
of dollars to Justin wren who is a,

171
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,880
he's got this charity that it does,
um,

172
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,440
finding for the forgotten and it's
all about the pygmies in the Congo.

173
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,240
He lives in the Congo most of the year.
And, uh, all that came from bitcoin.

174
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:24,560
I just took the money from, from
bitcoin. I doubled it, you know, I,

175
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,570
whatever the people sent in from the,

176
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,530
the donations from the address that we
posted on the website and the web show,

177
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,010
uh, I took that and a
whatever they came up with,

178
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:37,970
I added the exact same amount and
we sent it to Justin. So I mean,

179
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,330
that money from bitcoin
donations want to deal, uh,

180
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,920
with a water issues that they have,
uh, digging wells, all sorts of things.

181
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:49,100
And he's going to be on the podcast
next week. So he'll explain to us,

182
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:51,210
but that's Bitcoin in action,
right?

183
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,250
Yeah. I, I've already done two or
three fundraisers with bitcoin.

184
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,610
There's a couple of favorite charities
that I support in a number of ways and I

185
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:04,050
found that the fact that it makes
it so easy for people to give and so

186
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:07,020
instantaneous and it's a way for them
to demonstrate why they love this

187
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:10,330
technology. A lot of people
will do it. So, um, and,

188
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,830
and a lot of people have been bugging
me to get you to take bitcoin on the

189
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:18,831
stores and take bitcoin on
various activities or maybe
even put a tip jar up for

190
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:22,770
your new comedy show. I heard,
I actually saw a trailer of that

191
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,660
comedy central would have to ask Tom
Comedy central to do that because a,

192
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,220
I did it through them,
this latest one. But yeah,

193
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,750
I'd be interested in
doing something like that.

194
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,130
I'm just right now I'm just super busy.
That's,

195
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,660
and it stops me from getting
a fully involved with this,

196
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:41,040
but I'm always fascinated and I love
watching other people adopt it as well.

197
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:45,080
Like a shooter. Jennings just had
a big ad online where he was, uh,

198
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,180
taking bitcoin for all of his new cds
and he was selling them old ones as well,

199
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,290
selling them all through bitcoin.

200
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,980
Yeah.
I've been to shoot her about

201
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,610
doing some, uh, some other
activities with bitcoin too,

202
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,960
so we'll see where that goes. Yeah.
Shooter loves it. He, you know,

203
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:01,730
he thinks bit coins a future and you know,

204
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:05,030
he didn't even know how to post the
other day were just talking about people

205
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:06,830
saying that Bitcoin,
you know,

206
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,070
hold onto your like people have this
idea of hold on your bitcoin and one day

207
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:13,340
you'll Cashman for $1 million
and he's like, no, hold on.

208
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:17,120
Your bitcoin and one day you'll
have bitcoin. Like you are needed.

209
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,650
You won't need the million dollars.
It won't, won't be valid. Like, well,

210
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,230
it'll be valid me.
I'm sure money's not going to go away,

211
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,270
but it'll also be just as valid.
And you know what you saying about paypal?

212
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:30,200
We're starting to see that.

213
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah, I think so. And, uh, you know,

214
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:35,360
you've got to think also about many
countries in the world where their own

215
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:38,280
currency is, is really bad. And, uh,

216
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,250
this represents a global currency
that may end up being more stable,

217
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,200
more valuable than their own currency.

218
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,520
So is it going to be more valuable
and more stable than the U s dollar?

219
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,590
Probably not for you know, at the
best case, decades if then if ever,

220
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,440
but there's 193 currencies out there.

221
00:12:57,441 --> 00:13:02,441
Can it be more stable and more valuable
in the 30 of those probably is today and

222
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,210
50 of those within a few years.

223
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:09,560
So you're basically seeing this
revolution in international currencies.

224
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:13,250
We're not going to displace
the most successful currency
that the world has ever

225
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:18,140
seen over at night with something that at
five years old is a toddler technology.

226
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,370
Um,

227
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,880
but we can offer opportunities around
the world where their own currencies are

228
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,510
really,
really poor and,

229
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,300
and not very good for transnational
and cross border transactions at all.

230
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,920
Now what has been going on as far as like
the shift, cause I know that there's,

231
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,360
there's been a lot of volatility issues
where the price has gone up and down.

232
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:41,110
Things have moved around a lot.
Like has that in any way stabilized?

233
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,580
Um,
it's stabilized.

234
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:48,581
If by stabilize we could say that it's
gone down quite a bit and then it's kind

235
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:54,341
of stuck to around the three 50 to
$400 US dollar level for a while now.

236
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,550
Um, but you know, it, it depends
on what you do with bitcoin really.

237
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:04,760
There's, the volatility really affects
you if you're looking for an investment,

238
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,960
especially if you're day trading.

239
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:10,520
Bitcoin wishes about the stupidest thing
you can do because it behaves like a

240
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
penny stock on steroids,
right?

241
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:16,540
So a lot of people get into bitcoin
because they hear about the price and they

242
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,810
get this idea that this is a get
rich quick scheme, which it's not.

243
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,880
And they try their hand at day trading
with disastrous consequences because

244
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:30,881
you're talking about a very volatile
market with exchanges that are not

245
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:35,150
regulated and in various
countries around the world,

246
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:39,110
which have very little liquidity and
some pretty big professional traders who

247
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:44,111
are like sharks in the water were like
playing the market quite effectively and

248
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,360
taking all the newbies for a ride.
And so that's not,

249
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,050
I don't think that's a
valuable activity in bitcoin.

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,760
I think if you use it to
as a payments network,

251
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,410
accept bitcoin then converted to your
national car and see to restrict your

252
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,880
exposure.
So for example,

253
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,030
a Sasol tee shirt for $10 I'll price it
at a $10 I'll get $10 worth of bitcoin

254
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,860
and I'll convert it to $10 right away.

255
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,540
Now if next week the price
changes, doesn't matter. I've
already sold a tee shirt,

256
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,000
I've already got dollars in return,
I'm good.

257
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,540
I've opened up a completely new payment
channel without any of the risk. So,

258
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:26,120
so you can kind of get around that and,
and find ways to use it.

259
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,080
I don't really, you know, for some people
bitcoin can be a longterm investment,

260
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,030
but it's really dumb to day trade.
It's,

261
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,730
and that's where you get exposed
to most of that price volatility.

262
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,870
Isn't that an issue though of you're
selling things and cause of your selling

263
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,220
things online?

264
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,340
Like would you sell it like say if you're
selling mugs mug you have in front of

265
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:49,930
you, you're, you were selling
them for, you know, $10 American,

266
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,980
what would you,
$10 worth of Bitcoin?

267
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,690
Is that how you would factor it in?

268
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,700
Yeah, so let's say, um, today bitcoin is,

269
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,090
I actually don't know what the price
is right now, but I can look it up.

270
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:06,470
And so I can say what is
$10 worth in in Bitcoin?

271
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,140
And once I do that calculation,

272
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:13,700
I can figure out what the price
is and I can price the, um,

273
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,310
the sale. So for example,
I would say receive,

274
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,360
I would pick an amount in dollars,
say $10.

275
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:25,361
So $10 at the moment is 0.026 bitcoin or
26 point 18 millibitcoins thousands of

276
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,380
a big c.

277
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,780
I would just so the customer wouldn't
see this and the website will do this

278
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:38,930
automatically. So I'd put my mug
up, you'd click it, we say, okay,

279
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,180
$10 you put it in your cart,
you say checkout,

280
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,350
and it would just present
you with a QR code like this.

281
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,040
Now this is actually asking for
10 US dollars worth 26 millibits.

282
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,880
So if you tried to click
on this with your wallet,

283
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,240
it's going to tell you to pay the amount
of $10 10 US dollars equivalent in

284
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,600
bitcoin.

285
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,830
So the store does the
calculation automatically and
then when the bitcoin comes

286
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:04,664
in,

287
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,820
it gets bundled and at the end of the
day it gets converted to dollars or

288
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,310
sooner. If you have a lot of volume
and so you don't see any fluctuation,

289
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,730
price goes up, price goes down. It doesn't
matter cause you price it, you earn it,

290
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,743
you convert it.

291
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,230
Now when you do that though,
like if you were,

292
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,740
if you're a person that has
bitcoin and you're buying things,

293
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,510
you would wait until it's worth more
before you bought something, right? Yes.

294
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,410
So you wait until your bitcoins more
valuable or I'm thinking about buying

295
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:34,981
something,

296
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:39,000
but I want to hold on until big like that
seems to be a bit of an issue, right?

297
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,230
Yeah.
That's called a deflationary effect,

298
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:44,860
which means that if you have a currency
that is deflating where the value of the

299
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:49,510
currency is increasing over time, then
people will tend to hoard that currency,

300
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:54,030
hold onto it and not spend it right away
because they hope that it's going to be

301
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,800
worth more in the future. Um,
now in the case of Bitcoin,

302
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,670
we've had periods where
it's climbed in value,

303
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:03,730
so the hoarding instant gets strong.
We've had periods where it drops in value,

304
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:06,690
so people want to get rid of it.
All currencies have that.

305
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:09,120
Bitcoin has it a bit more of the
moment because it's volatile.

306
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,550
The hoarding is instinct.
You know,

307
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,800
it's funny because in the US we call it
the hoarding instinct in Asia that what

308
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,250
they call this savings,

309
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,560
which is an inconceivable
concept to most Americans,

310
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:26,570
like the saving grace for example in
Asia exceeds 20% in some countries and in

311
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:31,350
the u s it's a negative
0.2% or something like that.

312
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,130
So actually people increase their
debt every month instead of saving.

313
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,320
So it's also a cultural thing.

314
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,330
I think hoarding is seen
as a bad thing in a very,

315
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,290
very strong consumer society where you're
supposed to take care of the paycheck

316
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,530
and converted directly into plastic crap
from China as quickly as possible and

317
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:56,640
not keep pending all of it for the
future that that makes for a really good

318
00:18:56,641 --> 00:19:00,000
black Friday. Right? That's
the attitude. So if you,

319
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,610
if you don't spend that seen
as a bad thing, I'll tell you,

320
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:06,180
once I started using Bitcoin,
I ended up saving more money.

321
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,120
I did become more frugal
with my purchases,

322
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,260
but honestly when I saw something
that was priced correctly and I wanted

323
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,150
something to buy,
I'd buy it.

324
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:18,240
I wouldn't wait another week for the
price to go up or down and start because

325
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:21,610
then again, at that point you're
back to j day trading. Right?

326
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,020
Well since it's gone with paypal,
you could pretty much buy,

327
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,390
there's a lot of things you can buy.
I mean,

328
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:31,050
I wouldn't say everything but many things.
When you go to buy things online,

329
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:35,610
do you view that paypal option at
checkout? Yeah, and to paypal vendors.

330
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:37,500
We'll turn off the bitcoin option yet,

331
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,140
but they will have the option to turn it
on overtime. As paypal rolls this out,

332
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,480
they just started it as a trial basis.
It's probably going to take, you know,

333
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,370
six months to a year before they role
as how it fully and then it's sounding

334
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:50,491
good,

335
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:54,540
mean 19 countries or have any paypal's
serves and the merchants will have to go

336
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,510
and turn it on. But you know, it
gives them another sales channel.

337
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:02,511
So the other nice thing about that
is that if you have a web store,

338
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,760
pay pal integration usually comes with it.

339
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,160
So turning on in your
paypal merchant account,

340
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,070
the bitcoin option makes your existing
web store bitcoin capable without you

341
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,770
having to change any of the code.
And that's a pretty big deal.

342
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,920
That is a very big deal. You surfing
totally unrelated over there? No,

343
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,570
I was trying to recover
my a big coin wallet.

344
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,470
We were talking about that
before the show. So he,

345
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,370
he got a new phone and his bitcoin wall
and for whatever reason didn't transfer.

346
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,140
Yeah. I mean I backed up all like,
you know, you get your phone,

347
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:38,650
you back up all your programs and
stuff before I sent, you know,

348
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:43,050
I sold my old phone and uh, didn't even
think about it. Redownloaded all my,

349
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,020
my apps on media automatically open
it up and it's like, oh, you know,

350
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,190
sign up or

351
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,480
use an existing user and try to put in,
there's an,

352
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,740
it's really hard to figure out.

353
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:56,350
That's why I was just trying to do is
going online and try to reset my password.

354
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:00,580
They won't let you reset your password
ever cause they don't keep passwords on

355
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:04,690
the websites. So it looks like I might've
just pretty much lost my wallet. Right.

356
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,240
It depends. I think, um, if you use the
application that we installed last time,

357
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:13,270
which was blockchain in full,
that created a web account,

358
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,660
the wet with it and if you put
your email address in there,

359
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,660
you can reset it fairly effectively so
you can send them a support message and

360
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,300
they can probably recover your wallet.
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

361
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:26,100
That's what I was doing just now where
I found out the email address I used,

362
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,250
but now I have to like fill out this
questionnaire with my Skype name and stuff

363
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:33,950
like that. It looks like they might want
to even interview me to see him. It's,

364
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,300
it's actually going to take a few days
and the reason it's going to take a few

365
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,410
days,

366
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,200
and I used to advise that company from a
security perspective is because what we

367
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:45,970
would do is we'd have hackers who
compromise people's GML account.

368
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,250
They found the fact
that they signed up for,

369
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,300
for bitcoin wallet and they'd use the
fact that they use our email address,

370
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:56,830
they trawl and find their wallets name
and a bunch of other information and then

371
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,860
they'd go to this website, tried to do
a reset and try to steal their money.

372
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,320
So we make it a bit harder.

373
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,650
You have to get a confirmation
through email, um,

374
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,790
so that people can't easily social
engineer and fish for your account.

375
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,590
But it seems like it's possible,

376
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:14,050
which is good to hear because
that's absolutely possible.

377
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,500
You should be able to recover your funds
and then all you have to do is then

378
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,390
connect the application
back to the website.

379
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,950
And that's the advantage of this hybrid
model where your wallet is on your phone

380
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,490
and you have complete control. The
website doesn't have access to it at all,

381
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,720
but it stores and encrypted backup online
so that as you see if you lose your

382
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:35,050
phone or, or drop your phone
in the toilet. Right, exactly.

383
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,860
If you have like $1 million with a bit
coin and your phone and it falls into the

384
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:40,270
toilet, that's yeah, that would be bad.

385
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:43,990
You shouldn't keep that much money on
your phone anyway. Uh, just like, I mean,

386
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:48,991
you have to treat your phone wallet
the same way you treat your wallet,

387
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,480
which is,
I don't carry my entire net worth in here.

388
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:56,230
I have a bit of petty cash in
here and the rest of my bitcoin,

389
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,590
I'm just like the rest of my us dollars.
I keep offline.

390
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:00,880
I keep it in another location.

391
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,800
One of them Floyd Mayweather type
ballers flex to walk around with a big

392
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,760
briefcase full of bitcoin. Well then you
can do some pretty cool demonstrations.

393
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,960
Uh, there's this investor in
Argentina who gathered a bunch of his,

394
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:16,210
his investment friends at a,

395
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,170
at a golf outing and set
them down at a table. Six,

396
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,820
six people who had, um, you know,

397
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,610
just some of them had just met with the
other people and had never done bitcoin

398
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:29,680
before. And he said, Hey, let
me show you how bitcoin works.

399
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,310
Download this application to your phone.
So they all did that and he said, okay,

400
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,240
well we're going to do is we're going to,

401
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:37,990
I'm going to send you some money
and we play hot potato. So you, you,

402
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,890
you receive it,

403
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,860
you wait and you send it to the person
next to you and then the person next to

404
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:44,440
you and then the person next
to you and I call it great.

405
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:46,240
We're going to move some bitcoin

406
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,570
around,
see how this works.

407
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,350
So since the first batch and the first
person looks at their phone and they just

408
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:52,910
received the quarter of a million dollars,

409
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,780
what a quarter of $1 million sent in a
matter of seconds for a third of a penny.

410
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,870
And then they're like, they're hand
shaking and they just swipe across,

411
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:04,790
send it to the next person,
quarter million dollars,

412
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,310
quarter million dollars
six times around the table.

413
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,470
Now you've done one and a half million
dollars worth of wire transfers for total

414
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:16,940
cost of less than 10 cents.
And it's back at the original owner.

415
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,680
And,

416
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,680
and the purpose of this demonstration
was there is no payment system on the

417
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:26,680
planet that could do what we just did.
Yeah.

418
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,150
But in the future you're going to get
screwed. Like the IRS. It's like, Hey,

419
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:33,440
it says here, you've shared a half million
dollars, we need half a million of,

420
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,550
you know. Well, yeah, that depends.

421
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,990
I mean like what's the IRS his take on
it and now there's some unique take on

422
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:46,220
what bitcoin actually is. They're not
treating him as if it's the regular money,

423
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,700
they're treating it for taxation purposes.

424
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:52,370
The way that we treat
a tradable commodity,

425
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,680
which means that if you buy bitcoin and
the price goes up and you sell bitcoin

426
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,020
and you make a game,
you have to pay capital gains tax.

427
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,110
And if you earn bitcoin by
selling products and services,

428
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:04,430
then you have to pay income tax.

429
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,140
Which to me is a very reasonable and
sensible way to treat it. So for example,

430
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:13,220
if I do a Gig and Europe and
I charge my clients in euros,

431
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,140
I'm going to pay income
tax on those years.

432
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,530
But if I hold those heroes for three
months and then I sell them, um,

433
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,440
and the price has gone up,
in the meantime,

434
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:24,770
I'm going to pay capital gains on the
difference between the price I bought them

435
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:26,270
or in the math and the price of solar.

436
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,510
So it works in exactly the same way at
the IRS doesn't go around really tracking

437
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:36,140
everybody's bank account, doing the psalms
and checking against your tax return.

438
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:37,310
That's not how it works.

439
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:42,311
The way it works is you make the
burden is on you to make an honest,

440
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:45,380
truthful and complete return.
And when you make an honest,

441
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:48,890
truthful and complete return, quite
honestly, they don't check it.

442
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,030
If they have reason to suspect where
they randomly sample that they do

443
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:56,720
statistical analysis and they,
they see the things don't add up,

444
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,640
then they're going to come and say,
okay, you said x, prove it right.

445
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,940
And they sh they flipped the burden
and now you have to show that this is

446
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:07,850
exactly what happened. Well,
they treat bitcoin the same way.

447
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,070
I make an honest,

448
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,300
truthful and complete tax return
to the best of my ability.

449
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:18,350
And I calculate my income based on
my invoices and things like that,

450
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:22,040
which I receive in Bitcoin and I calculate
my capital gains and I pay my taxes.

451
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:22,490
I mean,

452
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,490
it's really not complicated for me
and it's not complicated for the IRS.

453
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,510
And if they come audit me,
they're going to ask me, you know,

454
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,070
show us where this bitcoin came from.
A were wet and I can show up.

455
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,280
Is there any way,
I don't know if this is even possible,

456
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:42,281
but is there any way to simplify what
dollars to bitcoin actually stands for?

457
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,040
Because when you say

458
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,960
that one bitcoin is,
you know,

459
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,290
x amount of US dollars or
$1 is Baba, you know, in,

460
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,230
in digital points of Bitcoin,
that conversion is confusing to people.

461
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,180
Oh yeah. It's, it's, it's
really confusing. Yeah. That,
and I think that's an issue.

462
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,810
Yes. Sorry, that's an issue
with some folks when you know,

463
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:07,350
you talk about like getting involved
in bitcoin and they see the numbers and

464
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:12,300
they see the differentiation.
It's, it's problematic.

465
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:16,380
It gets, it gets in their head, they're
like, oh, what is it? How much is 0.1

466
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,750
it's, it's hard. It's hard enough to
go to Italy, order an espresso, right?

467
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,770
And pay 1,500 Lira.
And in your head,

468
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:29,220
you're trying to figure out how
much is 1,500 Lira and dollars.

469
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,860
That's already confusing enough for
most people because it involves the,

470
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,300
you know, higher order mathematics
of division, which, you know,

471
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,570
I can't do it in my head. I use a
calculator and when it comes to Bitcoin,

472
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:46,200
it's worse because when we
use bitcoin as the units,

473
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:48,570
because it's worth a lot more than $1,

474
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,510
all of the denominations
end up being fractions.

475
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,500
So at 0.026 for example,
is $10.

476
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,340
And that's even worse because most
people can't do fractional mathematics,

477
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:01,330
save their life.
Um,

478
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,220
so one solution to that is
to switch the unit of value.

479
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:08,580
So instead of talking about Bitcoin,
you talk about the middle of bits.

480
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,840
So it's easier to say it's
26 millibits 26. Okay,

481
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:16,470
26 for a t shirt. I can understand
that. That makes a lot of sense.

482
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,980
And when Bitcoin was at
about a thousand dollars,

483
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:21,570
then a middle a bit was a dollar.

484
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:25,470
So it was a lot easier cause then it
would have been 10 millibits for a $10 tee

485
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:28,890
shirt. And that makes a lot of sense.
Other people who've proposed bits,

486
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,560
which takes you more to
the Italian lira side,

487
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,280
which is a hundred
thousandth of a bitcoin.

488
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,360
And so at that point you're looking at,
you know,

489
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,780
5,000 or 10,000 for a t shirt. Um, so it,

490
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,840
it feels more like where you have bigger
numbers for smaller things like Italian

491
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:49,410
money,

492
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,410
but still better to do 5,000 bits,

493
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,060
which is a fraction of
a bitcoin for a coffee.

494
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,360
Then tried to do 0.0013 no
one can do that kind of math.

495
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,500
So really it's about what units do you
use for everyday conversation? Yeah,

496
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:10,410
no one can and no one wants to,
no one wants to be done.

497
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,430
We want like a dollar is
of this. Yes. You know,

498
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:16,660
I mean that's what people want.

499
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,560
I have the following simple rule of thumb,
which is that in any currency,

500
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:23,650
if you want to make it easy for people
and you can pick the currency units you

501
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:27,760
want, then a uh, a meal, a simple meal,

502
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:30,010
a sandwich,
a fast food meal,

503
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,040
a cup of coffee and a pastry should cost
between one and 100 of your units of

504
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:39,730
currency. Pick whatever units makes
it fall into the one to 100 range.

505
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,800
People are comfortable. The idea
of spending, you know, 10, 50, 60,

506
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,340
15 for a meal, a coffee, a pastry,

507
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,140
they're not comfortable with fractions.

508
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:52,810
They're not comfortable with
a very high numbers either.

509
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:56,770
Like spending 5,000 for a coffee
doesn't make sense, but you know,

510
00:29:56,771 --> 00:30:00,340
spending 25 of your units for a coffee.
That makes sense.

511
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,680
So that's my rule of thumb
between one and a hundred.

512
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,030
Pick the unit that makes it fall in that
range. You why when bitcoin was created,

513
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:09,010
was it established that way?

514
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:13,420
Where one bitcoin to be such a large
amount of dollars? Well, it wasn't a,

515
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,430
here's the thing, when it
was just that, first of all,

516
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,910
for the first year and a half of bitcoin
had no dollar price at all because no

517
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,240
one was,

518
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,560
there was no market where it was being
actively traded so that you could

519
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:29,860
establish a price point.
The price of the moment,

520
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:34,861
say $350 comes from the fact that recently
someone was willing to give someone

521
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:40,150
$350 for their bitcoin. So
it's a market based system. Uh,

522
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:42,220
when Bitcoin was launched,
uh,

523
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:46,390
you could buy a thousand bitcoin or
even 10,000 bitcoin for a dollar.

524
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:52,810
Damn right? Yes. Should have bought
some nice clean fuck. So we have,

525
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,760
we have a, one of the most famous things
as the pizza event, and this was when a,

526
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,870
in the first year and a half when nobody
really had a price for, for Bitcoin,

527
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,270
a user called Laszlo,
uh,

528
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,900
online suggested buying pizza for bitcoin.

529
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,210
And this was like crazy talk.
Like,

530
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,530
I want to find a way to use my
bitcoin to buy something I want.

531
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:17,110
And there were no markets. That was
no one who was taking it. He said,

532
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:18,010
I want to buy pizza,

533
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,640
so I'm going to give bitcoin to someone
who's going to order pizza with a credit

534
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:24,910
card online and have it delivered
to my, to my, to my house.

535
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,740
I believe we talked about this on a
$10,000 pizza now or something like that.

536
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,440
It was a 10,000 bitcoin pizza.
Oh Jesus.

537
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,960
That's a three point $5 million pizza.

538
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:38,200
He bought two of them that
$7 million for two pizzas.

539
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,140
So the point is the
price has varied a lot.

540
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,910
Bitcoin used to be fractions of
a penny and now it's 350 bucks,

541
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,450
so we don't know where
the price is going in.

542
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:54,451
The creator couldn't know what's the
creator and those who are participating in

543
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:58,480
the early days thought was, it's probably
going to be worth very little now,

544
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,440
but over time if people adopt it
because there's a limited quantity,

545
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:03,880
it's value is going to go up.

546
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,300
So we're going to need to have
more units to break it down into,

547
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,960
so we can start talking about tens
of bitcoins and hundreds of bitcoins.

548
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:15,610
Then we'll talk about bitcoins, then we'll
talk about tenths, thousands, millions,

549
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,840
and it goes down to a hundred millions.
The smallest unit is called a Satoshi.

550
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:21,400
It's a hundred millions of a bitcoin,

551
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,040
eight decimal places.
That seems ridiculous.

552
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,500
It's a pennies. I hate
pennies. I don't know.

553
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,550
I don't even really like
Nicole's fucking nickel.

554
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,850
Everything should be dimes or nothing
by quarter.

555
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,240
And this is the difference between the
digital currency because this doesn't

556
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:44,090
have value right now.
So you don't use it in conversation.

557
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,410
If it did have value in the future.
So if it was worth a quarter, right,

558
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,970
then you'd use that and Toshi and
I'll give you a cup of coffee. Yes.

559
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,100
And if right,

560
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,720
at which point I'm a bitcoin
will be worth a lot of money.

561
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,810
Now you were just in New Zealand.

562
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,900
I did a tour of Australia and New Zealand,
a series of talks about bitcoin.

563
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,090
A is also a conference.

564
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:11,510
They're called bitcoin south
and New Zealand in Queenstown.

565
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,230
Now when you fly over there, you paying
for your airline tickets with bitcoin.

566
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:20,510
Um, to indirectly, yes. Into that.

567
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,300
First of all,
when I was flying to New Zealand's,

568
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,270
my cost was covered by
the conference organizer.

569
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,710
The conference organizer was paying
both me and for all of the expenses in

570
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,240
Bitcoin, all of the suppliers, the
entire conference was paid for.

571
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:37,500
And bitcoin where they can
pay directly in bitcoin.

572
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,360
They pay in bitcoin where they can,
they sell it,

573
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:44,950
get New Zealand dollars and they
pay New Zealand dollars. Um,

574
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,800
I also got sponsored to do a
couple of talks in Australia.

575
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,570
I got paid in Bitcoin for that.

576
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,290
When you were, oh, when you
were over in New Zealand,

577
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:57,291
did you look into the Kim Dotcom situation
and are you a m s you're smiling,

578
00:33:58,351 --> 00:34:01,230
so you must be well aware of what's
going on with him over there.

579
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,290
I think, I mean, Kim Dotcom is, is,

580
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,820
is such a really great personality.
I mean he's,

581
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:12,350
he's larger than life. Um, and he,

582
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:17,410
he just has this tendency to poke a
stick in the eye of governments and he,

583
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:22,670
he often gets away with it
because governments tend to
overreact and break their

584
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:27,440
own laws going after him, which is
hilarious, right? Because they, they,

585
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:32,030
they ran through just rough shod over
their own judicial system to confiscate

586
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:32,864
his servers.

587
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,250
And then he fought them in court and
he won because they lost in court.

588
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:40,730
They had to return his servers
to him after three heres a,

589
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,940
because they had to illegally confiscated
them and Kimdotcom who was allegedly a

590
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,230
accused of copyright infringement,

591
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,500
they raided his house with about a hundred
paramilitary to style police officers

592
00:34:55,971 --> 00:35:00,860
in the peaceful island of New Zealand
for God's sake and helicopters and

593
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:04,820
rappelling down from helicopters in the
middle of the night to serve a warrant

594
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:08,900
for copyright infringement. So I
mean, if that doesn't say overreach,

595
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,850
it's ridiculous.
That's clear that they're trying to say

596
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:17,500
some sort of a message and not just
send a message, but to scare him.

597
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,760
They're trying to bully him.

598
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:23,790
They're trying to write and bully anybody
else that would be brazen enough to

599
00:35:23,981 --> 00:35:24,730
have similar

600
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,910
existence. And this wasn't a
New Zealand operation alone.

601
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,610
This was in conjunction with the FBI
and other organizations from around the

602
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:36,290
world. And it was a massive overreach
and they broke their own laws to do it.

603
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,470
And he turned around and robbed it and
rub their face in it because they'd

604
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:45,440
broken the law. They ended up
being the criminals first. So yeah,

605
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,020
I don't know where the states
prosecution is going on that,

606
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,050
but as with many cases like this,

607
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,660
there's a lot of up front,
you know,

608
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:57,210
big talk about how
they're bringing it down,

609
00:35:57,211 --> 00:36:00,270
this great criminal and then all of the
charges fall apart when they tried to

610
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:01,170
present them in court.

611
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,720
Yeah. And there's, they're confiscating
all of his money to, right. Well,

612
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:07,420
they're trying to who
they have, I mean, he's a,

613
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:10,330
he's actually said that
he's broke now. He's, uh,

614
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:15,350
in some precarious situation because he
spent over $10 million in legal fees and

615
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,860
he, he actually generated some insane
amount of money since they released him.

616
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,760
We see in January, like $40 million with
him. I mean, he's a moneymaking machine.

617
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:27,580
The dude knows how to make
money. Right. But his, uh,

618
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:32,581
that whole mega upload
website and all that stuff,

619
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,120
because it's all that's all in
some serious trouble right now.

620
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,680
Yes, it is. Um, so yeah, I,

621
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,790
he obviously has nothing to do with,
with Bitcoin,

622
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,650
just just to be clear in case that's why.

623
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,960
Well,
why wanted to bring that up that you know,

624
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:55,730
here's a guy who maybe could possibly
benefit from moving as money,

625
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,250
at least a big chunk
of it in the big coin.

626
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,150
Well,

627
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,530
I mean if what he's doing is in fact
legal and if what the government is doing

628
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:08,670
is in fact a bullying him
outside the parameters of law,

629
00:37:08,671 --> 00:37:11,940
then that might be a perfectly
justified stance. I mean,

630
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:14,780
I wouldn't recommend using pick
coin for criminal activities.

631
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,890
I don't think that's a
good advice for anyone.

632
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,930
Well, how legal noble of
you it, I wouldn't recommend

633
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,230
I, I don't, I don't think it's
right to, to sit here and encourage,

634
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,080
you know, illegal acts. But you know,

635
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:36,081
to talk about copyright infringements a
resulting in a helicopter raid and arms

636
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,650
military rate on someone's house in
the middle of the night. I think,

637
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,490
I think we have to really question
where is the justice in that time.

638
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,250
What exactly is going on with that case?

639
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:52,410
Well Copyright Infringement for folks
who are not completely informed on what,

640
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,670
what the whole upload situation is,
what w with kim.com [inaudible] website.

641
00:37:57,671 --> 00:38:02,671
What he was accused of essentially is
that people would upload illegal downloads

642
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,880
of movies,
of songs and things along those lines.

643
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,740
So he wasn't even doing
copywriting Fritchman himself,

644
00:38:09,741 --> 00:38:12,380
he was facilitating it
allegedly for others,

645
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,560
which is even once that removed from
a crime that is a civil crime against

646
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:18,944
property.

647
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,130
And I mean really talk about
an overreaction if that's
the standard of justice.

648
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,670
I have to ask.
Um,

649
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,720
what kind of armed helicopter response
should descend on Aig for fucking over a

650
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:37,120
million homeowners and stealing billions
of dollars during the mortgage crisis,

651
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,980
right?
How many,

652
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:43,360
how many helicopters should go down on
that case where you have actual victim?

653
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,400
So this is the real issue here,

654
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,110
which is that there are crimes
that result in mega victims.

655
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Millions of people put out of their homes
losing a generation's worth of savings

656
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,310
and no one goes to jail.

657
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,900
Yeah,
that's a huge point.

658
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:03,580
It's a monster point and there's
a sanctioned fevery in that sense.

659
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,960
Did you get to see the, the thing
that came out today, uh, in Iraq,

660
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,480
that there's 50,000 ghost troops.

661
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,100
There's 50,000 troops that are receiving
checks that are human beings that don't

662
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:19,330
even exist. Yeah. They don't even exist.
And they're, they're getting checks.

663
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:24,030
Hello? Yeah. War has always been the
most profitable racket available.

664
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,650
Yeah. I mean, there's plenty of, uh,

665
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,370
instances of people where
they're obviously doing
something that's illegal and

666
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:34,780
getting away with it.

667
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:39,870
And somehow or another it becomes okay
because it's sanctioned or because it

668
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:44,980
falls into some sort of a,
an area where you're,

669
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,650
you're not allowed to look
into it and like, like this.

670
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:52,450
But the mega upload situation
is very fascinating to me
because I've always been,

671
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,320
I've always been of the opinion when it
comes to digital downloads and things

672
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,630
like movies and songs,

673
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:05,290
that it is a completely new area.

674
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,750
And all our laws,

675
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,500
like our piracy laws and property laws,
they,

676
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:16,030
they're very vague when it comes to
digital copies because digital copies,

677
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,370
like people,
you can call it piracy all day.

678
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:23,050
I had Paul Stanley from kiss on and
he kept insisting that it's stealing,

679
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:27,850
that it's stealing and my take on it
is it's only stealing if the person who

680
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:29,890
originally had it doesn't have it anymore.
Right.

681
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,390
If I take care of Muffin, you don't
have any muffin to eat. Exactly.

682
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:36,360
If I take your song, you still have
that song and so does everybody else.

683
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:41,380
Exactly. So it becomes an issue
of what is the song, what it,

684
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,500
what is it, where does
it go? It's not stolen.

685
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:50,740
Someone may have illegal illegally copied
it and put it up so that other people

686
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:55,490
can take it down and then it becomes
sort of almost like a matter of ethics.

687
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:59,150
Like if you appreciate the artist
and you want to support the artists,

688
00:40:59,151 --> 00:41:00,890
there should be some way you can do that.

689
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,920
And I also have always said that if
someone can't afford to buy your songs,

690
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,130
like if they're a fan of your band,
but they have no money but they can,

691
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,960
they can download your, your music and
then one day pay to see you in concert.

692
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,360
Like you gained a fan,
right?

693
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:22,280
Or you that fan stayed
supporting you with? They did,

694
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,710
but they didn't have money to
buy your shit in the first place.

695
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,600
They would not have purchased it.

696
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,460
But now they have it and they
get to enjoy it and they're,

697
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,560
it's one more person to tell other.
And

698
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,040
I think statistics have shown that like
artists are making the majority of their

699
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:45,290
money now, like music artists through
live performances because this,

700
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,310
well, let, let's look at historically
what happened with music piracy.

701
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,560
Music piracy at a time when music was
incredibly expensive and inconvenient to

702
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:55,640
get was thriving.

703
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,290
And what stopped the vast majority
of music piracy was not crackdowns.

704
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,230
It wasn't lawsuits.

705
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,100
It was the availability of things like
apple iTunes that made music easy and

706
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:09,170
convenient and accessible to people.

707
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,380
And then the range of music that people
started consuming expanded massively.

708
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,630
So from an artistic perspective,

709
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,620
music is now thriving from a
money perspective. However,

710
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,040
a lot of that profit is
being concentrated in apple.

711
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,680
Here's the thing though, and I hate
to drag us back and you know this my,

712
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,600
my thing I'll,

713
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,760
I'll find a way to introduce but coin to
tie everything in and the way everyone

714
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,210
around me.

715
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:40,210
But one of the things I think that is
magical about bitcoin is because it allows

716
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:41,510
micro payments.

717
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:46,511
You can pay five pennies and you can
pay five pennies in such a way that the

718
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:49,760
person receiving the five
pennies still gets five pennies.

719
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:53,090
It doesn't get chewed up in fees and
transaction costs and things like that.

720
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,010
And you can do that instantaneously.

721
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,400
It offers on the Internet a completely
new business model for content and

722
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,610
artistic creation.

723
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,850
So this means that artists can now
sell a listen of a song rather than,

724
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,410
you know, the eternal perpetual
rights of reproduction of a song,

725
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:13,700
which is very expensive,

726
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:18,910
a single listen for a penny for a 10th
of a penny and actually do that without

727
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:24,530
most of that money going to apple or
visa or some of the intermediaries,

728
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:25,880
but go directly to the artist.

729
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,960
We're already seeing that artists are
beginning to use bitcoin to make a direct

730
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:33,770
connection between themselves and the
consumer gets most of the money come to

731
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:35,510
them instead of the intermediaries.

732
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,840
And it creates a new funding
model for content creators.

733
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,880
And this also applies to news and media
and bloggers and people who write and

734
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:47,090
make music and make youtube
videos for a living.

735
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:52,450
So until now it was really difficult
to earn money on the Internet.

736
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,320
And the reason for that is because you
are delivering a very small amount of

737
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:01,880
value to each one of your consumers,

738
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,540
but there was no payment mechanism by
which they could pay you for a very small

739
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:09,860
amount of money. They can only pay
you for $5 or more. And there's very,

740
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,400
it's very hard to bundle.
So as a result,

741
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,500
you end up doing two things.

742
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:20,000
You either sell the consumer themselves
by taking all their private information

743
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,380
and turning them into a profile and
selling the crap out of that to marketing

744
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:25,214
companies.

745
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:30,310
Or You cram advertising down
their eyeballs until they
hate what they're seeing.

746
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,130
And now we have a third

747
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,130
way, which is they actually pay
for the content they consume.

748
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,530
And that's revolutionary.
I mean it really is.

749
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:40,020
You could do some amazing things
with music and publishing.

750
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,260
It's incredibly difficult to get people
to pay for anything online though.

751
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,700
I mean that's always been the rub. The
rub is that the Internet is so available.

752
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,570
There's so much. Yeah, there's the,

753
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:54,090
it's essentially just this open ocean
of content that anybody coming along

754
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:58,010
saying, I want you to pay to read
my blog. Fuck off. You know, I've,

755
00:44:58,011 --> 00:45:00,600
I've seen that before. I've
seen people say, you know, the,

756
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:03,300
you have to pay to read their blog and
when he got to be out of your fucking

757
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:05,130
mind,
no one's going to pay to read your blog.

758
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:10,430
People have a actually sent me links to
websites that have paid subscription,

759
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:14,640
like a link. Like on Twitter. It's
like really like kind of a scam.

760
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:18,810
Like they're sending me a link so that
hoping I retweet it and I'll click the

761
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:23,250
link and then they'll say to read more,
you know, subscribe. I'm like, fuck you.

762
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,140
Well,
how much does it cost to subscribe though?

763
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,260
Like five bucks or something like
that or something along those lines.

764
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:32,640
What if it was a penny Isaac,
he wanted to hear most. Okay.

765
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:34,830
If it's music you want to hear,
yes.

766
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,980
If it's a movie you want to
watch a documentary and watch,

767
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:43,370
but for a lot of things it's just people
are going to find if you find something

768
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:47,220
similar that's free, you're just
going to go towards that and if so,

769
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:51,210
if there's something like like reading
something like reading someone's blog,

770
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,690
that's a perfect example.
Most blogs are free.

771
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,270
The vast majority of blogs are free.

772
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,780
That's how people read them in the first
place because it doesn't cost me any

773
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:05,760
step that you take even a one click
Amazon step where it's so simple.

774
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,840
Amazon one click is just the most simple
thing of all time. I love it. I like it.

775
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:12,120
Bang, you hit that button.
It's on its way to you.

776
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,160
They already have your address in there.
It's just super easy to get even that,

777
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,180
like people like,

778
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:22,890
why do I have to pay for this when
I can just go to his blog and,

779
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,910
and, and read it for free or her blog
and read it for free. Why would I,

780
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:31,440
why would I give you money for
something that is available for free?

781
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,260
So when you get something like,

782
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,890
like a blog or a newspaper
online or a website, it's,

783
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,300
it's kind of already been clearly
established that that's a free service.

784
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,760
I think to a certain extent it has been.

785
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:50,150
The reason is that previously you were
representing the cost of production and

786
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:54,440
then with the Internet, the cost
of production fell to zero, right?

787
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,570
The value of what you're
delivering is a bit more than zero,

788
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,950
but it's not high enough to
charge a credit card or to
differentiate it from all

789
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:03,570
the other free things that are out there.

790
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:08,310
And there's no payment mechanisms that
fills that gap between zero and $5. Right?

791
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,020
So your cost dropped to zero,

792
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,090
your minimum charges $5 and
there's nothing in between. And,

793
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:19,140
and that means that a lot of things that
may be worth a dollar or 25 cents or 75

794
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,150
cents and people would actually pay
because you can only charge five or zero,

795
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,840
you end up going for zero.
And you say that because of bank fees.

796
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,040
That's why you can only charge

797
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,960
because yes, absolutely.
Because credit card,

798
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:36,160
minimum transactions online cannot go
below five and the inconvenience and the

799
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:38,890
information, the identity information
you provide and all of that.

800
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:43,570
So we haven't explored
that range of zero to $5.

801
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,180
And so if I could say for example,

802
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:51,210
right now the New York Times wants me to
pay 10 bucks a month to read more than

803
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:56,110
10 articles. But then if I want
to read the Washington Post,

804
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:59,380
I have to pay another 10 bucks a month
to read more than 10 of their articles.

805
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,860
And The Los Angeles Times has
experimented with something the same.

806
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:08,370
What if I could put down $2 a month
and read 25 articles from all of the

807
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:15,490
newspapers that I want to and just
put that into my browser and say,

808
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,060
I went to to allocate $2 a
month to newspaper articles.

809
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,820
I'm going to give them a
penny or half a penny each.

810
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:26,470
I'm going to read 25 50 a hundred
articles from all of the newspapers.

811
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,700
Now they're generating an actual revenue
stream and it may seem tiny when I'm

812
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:33,430
paying just a, you know, a
fraction of a penny per article.

813
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,440
You multiply that by a million consumers
and you got some real money coming in

814
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,820
more than they're making
with these pay walls,

815
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,670
so you start exploring that range
between zero and five four zero and $10 I

816
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:49,930
would pay for quality news
content without Todd futzing.

817
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:55,230
We know people will pay for things that
are free FBN proofs that apple iTunes

818
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:58,840
proves that when I can
go out and torn to song,

819
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,860
but it's more convenient for me to pay
a dollar 99 and just buy it to high

820
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:03,694
quality.

821
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:08,290
If you deliver high quality content and
you lower the barrier for paying enough

822
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,250
people will pay for high quality content.
And what we,

823
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:16,350
we can do with bitcoin is lower that
barrier enough that a whole range of

824
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:21,730
content that you could never charge for
before that was forced to free because

825
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:26,731
there's no intermediate step can now
make the artist and the creator income

826
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,440
directly without intermediaries,
without them taking a giant cut.

827
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:31,570
I think that's pretty exciting.

828
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,790
It is exciting.
Is there a way,

829
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,510
I was thinking this like you
remember the old days of dos and the,

830
00:49:38,511 --> 00:49:43,511
the early versions of windows like with
the command line prompt and you know,

831
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:48,130
people who knew how to use and people did
and it was very prohibitive for people

832
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:50,270
who are uneducated and code.
Um,

833
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:55,450
and then came along the
modern graphic user interface.

834
00:49:55,810 --> 00:50:00,340
And essentially what you're doing is
you're hiding all of that secret shit

835
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:03,010
behind it and you're creating
something that's much more simplistic.

836
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:07,900
Is there a way to do that with Bitcoin
to take away all these weird fucking

837
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:12,901
numbers and Zeros and ones and point
this point that and break it down to

838
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:19,711
something or would it have to be
stabilized first where the the actual,

839
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,310
the,

840
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:26,310
the price of Bitcoin or the value of
bitcoin would be stabilized to the point

841
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:28,220
where something like
that would be applicable?

842
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,740
I think you,
you nailed it.

843
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:35,770
We are in the dos days of digital money
and a lot of things need to change.

844
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,470
So what you have here, three things
that are happening simultaneously.

845
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,770
One is the evolution of the user
interface and user experience.

846
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,020
The other one is user adoption.

847
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:48,680
How many people are using it and how
many new people are using it every day.

848
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,060
And the third one is the price volatility
and those three are tied together.

849
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,430
You can't really get one before the other.

850
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,990
You can't really design beautiful user
interfaces if you have no users and no

851
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:00,860
value in the money,

852
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:05,510
you can't get users if you have no
beautiful interfaces and the money's too

853
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:09,830
volatile and the money won't become more
stable until you have more users using

854
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:10,790
easier interfaces.

855
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:15,791
So all three of these move together and
all you need to get to that is time.

856
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,240
So over time, if you look at
bitcoin today versus Bitcoin,

857
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:24,980
five years ago we had enormous progress
on the user end faces enormous progress

858
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,320
on the adoption and enormous
progress on the stability. And if,

859
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,920
and if you send say,
well it's a five year old now,

860
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,370
what will bitcoin look
like five years from now?

861
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,970
I think you're going to see bitcoin
addresses are going to disappear.

862
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,900
Just like Ip addresses.
We don't see them on the Internet anymore.

863
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,530
The user interfaces of Qr codes and
barcodes are going to disappear.

864
00:51:45,531 --> 00:51:49,610
We're already seeing protocols that allow
you to do tap to pay and swipe to pay

865
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:52,760
like apple pay with bitcoin quite easily.

866
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,910
And that certainly
happened. Yes, absolutely.

867
00:51:55,911 --> 00:52:00,020
You can do NFC as it's called near
field communications, like apple pay,

868
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:03,210
you can do tap to pay with Bitcoin,
but here's what you can't do with apple.

869
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:07,890
The account with Bitcoin, I can do
top to pay between two phones. Ah.

870
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:12,910
Like I could say t pay you with
bitcoin and with two phones.

871
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,480
Now do I need to do without
you being a merchant, right.

872
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,170
Cheetah cell service to do that
or can the phones communicator,

873
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,120
they can communicate
with each other offline.

874
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,970
So you can be on the fucking North Pole,
right,

875
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,560
with no self service and you could
swap big corn right back and forth.

876
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,890
You Playing Ping Pong?
Yes,

877
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:31,330
and all I'm doing is the same thing
I'm doing by scanning a barcode on it.

878
00:52:31,331 --> 00:52:34,820
I'm using the NFC protocol
to do it. So, so you can,

879
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
you can see how this technology is going
to get smoother and easier to use as we

880
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:45,020
have more adoption and at the same time
the price stabilized it and all three of

881
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:46,520
those metrics if you like,

882
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:49,610
we'll move in parallel and
they'll gradually gets easier.

883
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,280
I remember a time of the
Internet with Ip addresses.

884
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:54,800
I remember a time with
Dawson Unix command line.

885
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,570
I remember a time when sending an email
if you need it to have those skills and

886
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,820
you know, you just watch that
progression of the technology.

887
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,520
The most important thing is not
only will these things happen,

888
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:08,840
but the companies that build these things
are building billion dollar industries.

889
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:12,590
So the company that figured out how to
find things on the internet became Google.

890
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:17,060
Some company's going to figure out
how to make bitcoin easier to use for

891
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:17,571
addresses.

892
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:21,260
Some company's going to find out how to
make bitcoin easier to use for retail,

893
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,600
for music payments, for social media, uh,

894
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,520
for international remittances.

895
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,030
And each one of those companies is
going to build $1 billion industry.

896
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,740
Yet it seems like that is really the
next step. Figuring out a way to do it.

897
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,170
Do you remember the IRC chat
clients? You know, like,

898
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,180
that's like Uber Geek Shit Man. You know,
I used to use those when I was in the,

899
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:43,320
my quick playing days.

900
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:48,150
We'd all meet on IRC channels and we
all compete completely dorks. Yeah,

901
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:50,560
that little thing that
would do that rolling sound.

902
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:57,830
I mean there's things like that where
only the Uber geeks adopt them and they

903
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:03,670
just stay that way. Like IRC chat clients
still to this day, you bring up Iris,

904
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,340
there's people that are on IRC right now.

905
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:10,370
The entire bitcoin development happens
in collaboration over IRC and those are

906
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,180
recent for that because it's
global, it's open, it's transparent,

907
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,890
it's free and it's scalable and so no one
has built a better chat, which it yet.

908
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:25,170
Yeah, so my, my, yeah, there really
hasn't been, I mean a Google hangout,

909
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,960
those things did,

910
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,870
I mean they were trying to come up with
something along those lines. Right.

911
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:31,960
But it didn't really take off.

912
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:37,340
Is that still around that
Google plus and sort of kind of,

913
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:41,370
I mean it, it, it is, but I don't think,
I don't know anyone that really uses it.

914
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:44,910
It's hiding behind all the other Google
products because it's now used as the

915
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:49,770
main account and profile page. I have a
friend who's fucking, she works at Google,

916
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:52,720
she's an exec,
Google and you bring it up and she's a,

917
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:56,850
she'll millions of people use Google
hang out and millions of people are on

918
00:54:56,851 --> 00:55:00,690
Google pross right now just cause they
force you to sign up every time you go to

919
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:02,700
youtube and shit like that.
Exactly.

920
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:07,530
In that way it's very similar to Sirius
satellite radio subscription numbers.

921
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:11,110
Cause you know how when you
buy a new car it comes with a,

922
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:16,260
a car radio that has serious on it
and you're subscribed for 90 days.

923
00:55:16,261 --> 00:55:20,040
Like we added 50,000 new subscribers.
Right.

924
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:22,620
But how many of them were giving
you any fucking money at all?

925
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,700
Like how many of them are just getting
their subscription as a 90 day free trial

926
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:29,400
from, you know, buying
a Chevy or whatever.

927
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,010
It's even worse than that because
then they say we've got millions of

928
00:55:32,011 --> 00:55:35,010
subscribers on Google plus we'll,
you're a billion user company.

929
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:39,230
So that means only one in a
thousand is using it. Yeah.

930
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,310
I don't even think it's that many.
I mean,

931
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:45,030
I go on Google plus every now
and then and it's like a fucking,

932
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,560
it's like one of those buildings that
they build in China where no one actually

933
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:51,090
moves into them.
You ever see those?

934
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:54,930
A lot of the empty mega cities that ghost
towns. That's what Google plus is like.

935
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:56,010
I mean,
maybe I'm wrong,

936
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:59,760
maybe I'm just tapping into the wrong
Google plus communities and I'm just

937
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:04,410
missing a whole vein of interaction
that's an incredibly enriching and amazing

938
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:09,000
and magical. But I'm
not seeing it now. No.

939
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,400
But everyone's trying to come
up with something like the IRC,

940
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:19,250
like something that some or any
other social media platform. Any,

941
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:24,260
any other place where people can
communicate and make easy and make it less

942
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:29,290
forbidding. And I think there's
something about IRC they'll like,

943
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:32,980
to some people it's like,
it's just too fucking crazy,

944
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,800
the new, uh, where they take like,

945
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,660
at least with apple and Mac or they
now have like chat on your phone. Like,

946
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:42,430
now if you get a phone call,

947
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:47,050
it will ring on your computer and I will
ring on your phone and you can always

948
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:47,930
rings on your,
yeah,

949
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,490
you can set it up now with the Yosemite
or whatever the new operating system is.

950
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:54,100
That's annoying. It is. It isn't mine.

951
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:57,040
But it's great when your phone's dead
and you just want to like answer a phone

952
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,810
call real quick on, you know,
you could like, Hey, what's up?

953
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:01,820
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
So if your phone is dead, your,

954
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,480
your computer will ring.

955
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,600
Peter will ring or your iPad will ring
and you could set it up for anything.

956
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,340
But the thing I use the most is
the chat now is on all of them.

957
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:15,940
So you can, uh, I can
like chat on my computer,

958
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:19,680
like IRC and be like sending you
files and videos and stuff like that.

959
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,220
It as a text message.
Yeah.

960
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:25,180
And you'll get as a text message and
then I'll just go onto my bad thing also

961
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:26,620
with that is, uh, you know,

962
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:29,800
you go to work and then you leave your
iPad open and your girlfriend can see

963
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:30,830
every single thing you

964
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:34,610
who is your girlfriend?
What about anybody or your mom,

965
00:57:34,611 --> 00:57:38,570
your mom sr six Sr Dick
Pics. Yeah, exactly. Now,

966
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:39,770
if that's the case,

967
00:57:39,771 --> 00:57:43,250
like can you use your computer to make
phone calls if there's an internet

968
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,850
connection, but there's no,
there's no cellular connection.

969
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,460
Slowly and certain

970
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:54,910
t-mobile does where you can be on your
phone at your house on Wifi and then

971
00:57:56,361 --> 00:58:00,080
leave your house and it will
just jump to sell your service.

972
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,110
So you're not using your minutes when
you're at your house, but then, uh,

973
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,170
it goes right to your self service
right when you leave your house.

974
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,520
So it's handing off from
Wifi to LTE or whatever you,

975
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,690
right.
That's amazing that they can do that.

976
00:58:12,691 --> 00:58:16,400
Because you remember how it used to
drop off when you switch tower? Yeah.

977
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,920
So does that on, on, on
some networks really? Yeah.

978
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,690
So like as you're driving on the highway,

979
00:58:21,691 --> 00:58:25,320
it's still disconnects when you and you
have signals just switching from tower

980
00:58:25,321 --> 00:58:27,020
to tower. Yeah, a handoff. Uh,

981
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,120
technology is still pretty
shitty and a lot of cities,

982
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:35,150
that's crazy that they can use that
technology to go from your cellular

983
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:37,560
connection to your Internet
connection's seamlessly,

984
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,330
but they can't figure that out yet.

985
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:40,110
All right.

986
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:43,920
Google voice does that for a number of
customers and that it's a product they've

987
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:48,510
never really advertised. I've been a
Google voice customer now for six years.

988
00:58:48,511 --> 00:58:49,500
It's a free service.

989
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:53,550
I have a phone number that's Google
rings my cell phone and brings my desktop

990
00:58:53,551 --> 00:58:57,330
rings every device on Nare. I can forward
it to all kinds of interesting things.

991
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:02,040
Here's what happened there.
You took a telephone call,

992
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:07,340
which used to be a network and you turned
it into a content types that rides on

993
00:59:07,471 --> 00:59:10,680
top of the intranet. So now it
can ride on any network, right?

994
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:14,190
So you separate the
medium from the message,

995
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:18,570
you separate the content type from the
thing that's running on top of it and now

996
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:19,680
you can take that same thing,

997
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:22,490
a telephone call and do it
independent of telephone networks.

998
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:23,500
It can be on the landline,

999
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:28,250
cellular Wifi or any Internet
connection anywhere you have TCP IP.

1000
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,770
And the argument I'd be making about
bitcoin recently has been this the w we're

1001
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:36,800
just doing that for money for
the first time. So up to now,

1002
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:41,801
money has had networks and the type of
money you use and how you use it and what

1003
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:43,970
it can do depends on the network.

1004
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,140
So if you want to do consumer to business,
you can use visa,

1005
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:52,010
mastercard or American Express is going
to come with a certain specific fee.

1006
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:53,660
It's going to work only in some countries.

1007
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:55,400
You can only move a
certain amount of money.

1008
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:58,760
If you want to move money between banks,
you're going to use swift,

1009
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,020
the worldwide interbank fun transfer.

1010
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:06,260
If you want to move money between
checking accounts, you can use a ACH,

1011
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:09,530
the clearinghouse here in the u s so
that's how you move money between checking

1012
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:10,364
accounts.

1013
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:14,660
If you want to move money
between one of these things,

1014
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:16,220
then it gets complicated.

1015
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,700
So like if you want to move
using a visa card to a consumer,

1016
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:23,690
you can't really do it. You'll have to
use a check and things get really hairy.

1017
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,780
So you have these islands,
uh,

1018
01:00:26,781 --> 01:00:31,781
networks that can support small
payments only or large payments only.

1019
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,800
They can do fast money or slow money
that can do a government money,

1020
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:39,830
business money or consumer
money and none of them mix.

1021
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:44,720
So you can't switch between them.
Well bitcoin does small and large,

1022
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:48,920
fast and slow government and consumer.
And it spans all of these networks.

1023
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:53,921
Exactly like the Internet took
photography and moved it across all of the

1024
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:58,630
networks, took video and now there's no
difference between cinema, TV, you know,

1025
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,020
all of these different formats and took
telephone calls and move them outside of

1026
01:01:03,021 --> 01:01:03,854
their own network.

1027
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:09,040
Now we're doing that to money as a
pretty weird thing because when you turn

1028
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:10,760
money into a form of communication,

1029
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:15,380
it on shackles it from all of these
restrictions you can now do any amount.

1030
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:20,420
It's most country you can send money to
a person and not have any intermediary.

1031
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,900
You not have any third party.

1032
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:27,230
That third party has got to
get pretty fucking nervous.

1033
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:32,860
And what has been the reaction as far
as like banks or propaganda or any

1034
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:38,831
negative and negative reaction from
the powers of be about this possible

1035
01:01:39,381 --> 01:01:40,214
technology?

1036
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:45,230
Um, for the most part it kind of depends
on what kind of bank we're talking about

1037
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:46,880
because there are
different types of banks.

1038
01:01:46,881 --> 01:01:50,900
Like there are banks that are
primarily focused on consumer services,

1039
01:01:50,901 --> 01:01:54,560
checking savings, payment systems. Um,

1040
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,590
then there are banks that are mostly
about playing the market, right?

1041
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,030
Some of the big six banks,
they,

1042
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:04,240
they've actually pulled out of doing
consumer checking a city for example,

1043
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:06,860
recently pulled out of
12 different countries.

1044
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,700
No longer do consumer banking at
all. Uh, it's too complicated,

1045
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:15,540
has too many people involved who
cause problems. Whereas if you do,

1046
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,360
what is it? Well, no,

1047
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:21,120
I mean it's not a very profitable
business because you have to deal with

1048
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:24,600
customers and they're fickle. But
instead, if you're only customers,

1049
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:26,670
the Federal Reserve and
they give you free money,

1050
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:32,150
why on earth would you do consumer check?
Right? It's not profitable. So, um,

1051
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,680
some banks will look at bitcoin
and either think it's a threat,

1052
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:40,290
but most likely at this point
still think it's a joke.

1053
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:45,410
Like they can't possibly imagine any way
that this little experiment could ever

1054
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:48,420
threaten serious banking.
Right?

1055
01:02:48,421 --> 01:02:51,930
So now they're looking at like little
kids trading marbles or something, right?

1056
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:53,730
It's what I called the,
um,

1057
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,060
the idea that a lemonade stand
is going to threaten Walmart.

1058
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,400
That's what it appears to be to them.

1059
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:02,290
Then you've got banks that
deal with consumer checking.

1060
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,940
I've talked to a lot of banks that
look at this and say, for example,

1061
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:10,941
I talked to a bank in Brazil and they
have about 80 million people who have very

1062
01:03:12,931 --> 01:03:14,010
little access to banking.

1063
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,490
And the reason they have very little
access to banking is because the nearest

1064
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:22,491
bank branch to their location is a
hundred miles up river on a canoe,

1065
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,740
right? In the Amazon Basin,
it's opposite of bitcoin. It's,

1066
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,160
it's one of the most sparsely
populated countries in the world.

1067
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:34,440
So Brazil is an enormous country.

1068
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,760
It's a third of the continent
of South America. And,

1069
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,880
and some of the places are really,
really furry remote.

1070
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,070
But even though the bank branch is
a hundred miles downriver by canoe,

1071
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,530
does a cell phone tower in
the business and the Bush,

1072
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,740
there's a cell phone tower in
the middle of nowhere. Why?

1073
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:56,460
Because you can air lift it in,
you can plant it,

1074
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:01,520
you can put a microwave link that goes
2030 a hundred miles and you can power it

1075
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:06,540
with solar. So they've actually planted
cell phone towers. Now if you could.

1076
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,060
So they look at bitcoin and they think,
you know what?

1077
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,410
The villages have a cell phone tower
and they already have a Nokia 1000 that

1078
01:04:13,411 --> 01:04:17,160
does text messaging. Can I use bitcoin
to turn that into a bank terminal?

1079
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,360
Now I can get 80 million new customers
and give them banking that they've never

1080
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:24,330
had before. So some banks
are thinking that way, right?

1081
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:28,350
Banks in South Africa and
Brazil, in India, in China,

1082
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:29,820
in Indonesia,

1083
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:33,750
in places where you have very
sparse remote populations.

1084
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:38,040
And then there's other banks
here in the u s the smaller ones,

1085
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,410
they can't compete on marketing.

1086
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:45,000
They can compete on market size and
economies of scale and they can compete on

1087
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:47,340
buying politicians faster
than the big banks.

1088
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,330
So they need a secret weapon and they
look a bit coin and they think, well,

1089
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:54,930
you know what? This is a settlement
and clearing house network.

1090
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,450
And there's these companies
that do settlements,

1091
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,960
the charge of 3% could we
take them out of business?

1092
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:05,100
Could we disinter mediate them?
So they look, there's all of these

1093
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:11,550
companies that are private but effectively
have monopoly positions that do all

1094
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:16,320
of the clearing. The only banks know about
them. The depository trust corporation,

1095
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:21,730
Clearinghouse Corporation, which
basically clears all equity settlement.

1096
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:24,370
So when you buy stocks
on the stock market,

1097
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,460
you buy the stock in three days later,

1098
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,910
that goes through a batch
process that clears that stock,

1099
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,710
exchanges the money and gives
you ownership. That's run
by a company called DTCC.

1100
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,980
That company charges a lot of money
to do something very slowly and

1101
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:41,740
inefficiently. And the banks
look at that and say, Hey,

1102
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:46,060
could we use big point to take DTCC
out of business to take swift out of

1103
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:49,390
business to build our
own networks that are,

1104
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:54,280
that don't have a middleman because to us,
the bank is a third party,

1105
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:58,300
but to a bank, there's another third
party. Right. And they can take them out.

1106
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:01,010
That's fascinating.
So in a sense,

1107
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:06,230
what these banks can use in s and even
the people in in Brazil that are setting

1108
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:11,231
up these towers can use bitcoin for is
it's almost like a ability to send an

1109
01:06:13,131 --> 01:06:15,590
exchange money without
using the money itself.

1110
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:19,970
They do it through bitcoin and then that
money can be transferred back and forth

1111
01:06:19,971 --> 01:06:24,650
from bitcoin to money or to whatever
their local currency is. Or not.

1112
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,930
Either that or use the
underlying technology.

1113
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:31,860
For bitcoin to build their
own parallel networks.

1114
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,650
So just like for example,
in the first few years,

1115
01:06:34,651 --> 01:06:37,710
the big phone companies with terrified
of the Internet and things like Skype

1116
01:06:37,711 --> 01:06:41,730
because it threatened that long distance
market. The smaller companies that were,

1117
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,580
didn't really have a lot of
revenue from long distance,

1118
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:49,890
saw this as an opportunity to link
together calling cards and long distance

1119
01:06:49,891 --> 01:06:54,660
offers and things like that and run
back bound backbones over TCP IP to cut

1120
01:06:54,661 --> 01:06:55,350
their costs.

1121
01:06:55,350 --> 01:07:00,350
So here they had a more
efficient transportation
network for transporting voice

1122
01:07:00,511 --> 01:07:03,840
data, so now they could
compete against at and t.

1123
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:08,010
So even though the big companies
see may see it as a threat,

1124
01:07:08,011 --> 01:07:10,950
the smaller companies see it as a
weapon they can use in competition.

1125
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,120
It's fascinating.

1126
01:07:12,121 --> 01:07:16,140
Then when you have companies that are
worried about their businesses becoming

1127
01:07:16,141 --> 01:07:16,974
obsolete,

1128
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:21,600
when technology renders almost
anything that's not up to snuff,

1129
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:24,660
obsolete. Do you remember when
they used to have calling cards?

1130
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:27,000
They used to get a calling card,
used to have

1131
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:30,680
punching the number when you would go
somewhere and you would use there the the

1132
01:07:30,681 --> 01:07:32,770
local payphone,
and that's how you used,

1133
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,370
nobody has a fucking calling card anymore,
is

1134
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:36,780
anybody,
what is it?

1135
01:07:36,781 --> 01:07:40,550
Even one 10th of 1% of the population
that uses one of those fucking thing.

1136
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,520
The US, yes, but in the Philippines
and Indonesia and Africa,

1137
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:49,490
there's a lot of calling cards because
the main phone companies still maintained

1138
01:07:49,491 --> 01:07:50,011
monopolies,

1139
01:07:50,011 --> 01:07:54,960
but gradually the Internet has
been breaking down those barriers.

1140
01:07:54,961 --> 01:07:58,590
And Brian's ring, even calling cards
obsolete. Here's the interesting thing.

1141
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,330
The companies that are submerged in
their existing technology paradigm,

1142
01:08:03,331 --> 01:08:05,970
they're submerged in this
technology that's becoming obsolete.

1143
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,260
They're blind to it.

1144
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:12,290
They cannot possibly imagine a time
when this enormous edifice that they've

1145
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:15,150
built,
we'll come collapsing.

1146
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:20,710
Kodak could not imagine the fact that
film photography would become obsolete

1147
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,620
because of phones,
because of phones.

1148
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:29,920
And the funny thing is it wasn't a smart
move by Fujifilm or Nikon or one of

1149
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:33,140
their existing competitors.

1150
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:37,490
One day they were king of
the hill and I hear later,

1151
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,960
a little company from Finland
they'd never heard of,

1152
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:46,460
became the largest camera manufacturer
in the world's Nokia and started putting

1153
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:50,090
out more cameras than any camera
manufacturer in the world in a year.

1154
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:55,670
That was a transition in 1995 and
Kodak's suddenly got competition from a

1155
01:08:55,671 --> 01:09:00,350
completely unexpected thing. And what did
they do? They ridiculed it. They said,

1156
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:03,170
well, that grainy, they're shaky.

1157
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,680
You'll never get a real quality
camera photo out of that.

1158
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:11,780
People will still love their
crisp, clear, 24 exposures of film.

1159
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:16,070
There's artistic value to it's blah,
blah, blah. And three years later,

1160
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:20,360
the facing bankruptcy. Now that's
incredible. After that happened,

1161
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,480
they went bankrupt. They went by
some other, I mean three years,

1162
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,380
three years after the ascendancy of
Nokia that they were facing bankruptcy.

1163
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:27,921
And eventually,

1164
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:32,570
despite all of their efforts to go digital
and all of that crashed and burned.

1165
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,680
It's amazing. And, and this has
happened throughout history.

1166
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,150
The companies that are best positioned,

1167
01:09:38,151 --> 01:09:41,540
like you would think the Kodak could do
digital photography better than anybody

1168
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:43,820
else. I mean, they understood
photography. They had the brand,

1169
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:47,390
they had the market recognition.
Photographers loved them.

1170
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,120
So why couldn't they make
a play in this space?

1171
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,970
And history shows us
that the companies can't,

1172
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:56,630
they can't turn around fast enough.
They, they underestimate the risk.

1173
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,140
They overestimate the value
of the old technology.

1174
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,770
And we see this again and again.
Remember, you know, tower records.

1175
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:09,070
MP3S are never going to replace vinyl
because vinyl has this depth and richness

1176
01:10:09,441 --> 01:10:14,420
of sound. And people will always go
for quality over this cheap, metallic,

1177
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:18,020
crappy digital music.
We'll buy by tower records

1178
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:25,070
and, and, and this happens, it
post a video blockbuster video.

1179
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:26,690
And if you go further back,
you know,

1180
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:31,691
it's like people will not drive these
internal combustion horseless carriages

1181
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:37,430
because they're dangerous. They're
noisy, they're smelly, the roads,

1182
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:41,390
there's no roads, there's no gasoline.
Only crazy people would use them.

1183
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,790
Trust in the horse.
It's always worked for you.

1184
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:45,650
It's worked for thousands of years.

1185
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:51,100
And the interesting thing is even though
the companies that made horse buggies

1186
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:56,410
had all of the manufacturing to make
buggies and could see a radically just

1187
01:10:57,771 --> 01:11:00,800
pivot slightly stick an
internal combustion engine,

1188
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:03,320
they already had all of the
relationships with them.

1189
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:05,690
We'll makers with the spring makers with,

1190
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:09,720
they understood how to
build vehicle worthy row,

1191
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,260
roadworthy vehicles.

1192
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,400
All of them went out to business except
for one Studebaker was the only after

1193
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,810
less than two decades,

1194
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:24,110
Studebaker was the only us horse buggy
manufacturer that survive the transition

1195
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,750
into the automobile.
Are there,

1196
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,760
I wonder if it's possible at this point
in time for bank manufacturers if,

1197
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:38,410
I mean, you know, people who are
creating banks, you know, people,

1198
01:11:38,411 --> 01:11:42,830
Citibank and Bank of America
to to look at all that. It's,

1199
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:44,770
is it possible to look at all that,

1200
01:11:44,771 --> 01:11:48,610
that history and see that
you've got something coming up.

1201
01:11:48,611 --> 01:11:50,200
Just like the Nokia Camera,

1202
01:11:50,201 --> 01:11:53,920
you've got something coming up like it
might take a few years to, to settle in,

1203
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:57,970
but once people realize that you can do
pretty much anything right now you can't.

1204
01:11:57,971 --> 01:12:01,870
But once you can start
buying cars and went homes,

1205
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:05,720
vacations, paying for all these
things with Bitcoin, how much of it,

1206
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:09,520
how much money are people
going to want to put in banks?

1207
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:13,180
How much are they going to want to deal
with the idea of these third parties?

1208
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,410
And if that starts to happen,
how about the fucking Federal Reserve?

1209
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,150
That's where things get really squirrely.

1210
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:21,880
Cause Ryan is that Weirdo
fucking institution,

1211
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,650
that Jekyll Island fucking
strange institution that
we've been relying on for so

1212
01:12:26,651 --> 01:12:27,484
long.

1213
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:32,880
Well, um, to your first
point is the people who are,

1214
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:37,881
or who involved in the presence day model
of banking's a three to five business

1215
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:42,060
days to clear your check, the
fees, the banking hours, the slow,

1216
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:45,690
obsolete and inefficient.
They're never going to change that.

1217
01:12:45,691 --> 01:12:49,770
And the reason that they're, they're
going to take that all the way to Boston.

1218
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:54,780
And the reason for that is because they
can't possibly see a world where the

1219
01:12:55,111 --> 01:12:59,850
alternative really does win.
And it won't happen gradually.

1220
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:01,290
It won't be like, oh well, you know,

1221
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:04,710
Bitcoin is getting closer or digital
cards to getting closer to taking our

1222
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:06,690
business.
Maybe we should now start changing things.

1223
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,660
It happens like with most technologies,

1224
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:14,220
nothing happens for a while and the
interest builds up and then one day

1225
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,190
something clicks,
something changes.

1226
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,640
And the entire industry
flips. You know, for Kodak,

1227
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:23,010
this happened in about a year and a half.

1228
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:28,370
So the first camera phone came out and
you across the mega pixel barrier and

1229
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:33,240
boom, the entire industry flipped and
nobody bought film anymore. And so,

1230
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,940
and especially with banking,

1231
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:40,200
the crazy thing is that there's 4 billion
people out there who have never had

1232
01:13:40,201 --> 01:13:44,100
banking. And that's great because they
don't ever have to experience that mass.

1233
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:48,560
They can go directly to a digital currency
just like they never had landlines.

1234
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,760
They went directly to cellular telephony.

1235
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:56,100
And so you see this leapfrogging of
technology now as to the Federal Reserve.

1236
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:59,910
And most people don't even know what,
this isn't how it works.

1237
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:04,380
You know the Federal Reserve Bank,
it's the name is on the dollar bill.

1238
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,710
So it's a government organization rights.
It's a government institution.

1239
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:08,970
No it's not.

1240
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,720
It's a private company run by the banks
that has the right to create money out

1241
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,084
of nothing.

1242
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:21,150
And then so vat to the u s government
in exchange for debt and if that doesn't

1243
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:25,720
sound crazy to you,
I mean what does that,

1244
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:30,721
that is insanity and that organization
has the ability to pre create an infinite

1245
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:37,051
amount of money set the interest rates
between bank lending and is completely

1246
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:41,980
independent of government control and
that was considered a good thing because

1247
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:45,520
government manipulated money.
Now money manipulates government.

1248
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,670
That's incredible, isn't
it? It's incredible.

1249
01:14:49,671 --> 01:14:52,460
They're allowed to use the word federal.
I'm going to,

1250
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:54,890
I'm going to start calling
my comedy federal comedy.

1251
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,680
It's a government approved comedy, but
it's not. It's federal comedy, right?

1252
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:01,761
This is a,

1253
01:15:01,761 --> 01:15:06,761
this is a federal podcast like what the
fuck is federal is supposed to mean the

1254
01:15:06,771 --> 01:15:09,620
federal government. That's what
everybody automatically assumes,

1255
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:10,820
right?
The,

1256
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:14,940
the time in which the Federal Reserve
was created is a very strange time in the

1257
01:15:14,941 --> 01:15:15,930
history of this country.

1258
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:20,160
All of this is an experiment that's less
than a hundred years old and I think in

1259
01:15:20,161 --> 01:15:25,000
retrospect will appear to most people
to be a failed experiments that was done

1260
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:26,460
may no sense from the very beginning,

1261
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,670
well to hustle. Let me, and
that's really what it is.

1262
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:33,671
It's a money grab on a large scale and
incredibly large scale that includes the

1263
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:38,810
politicians that were involved
and allowing it to form
the people that are alive,

1264
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:43,870
that are allowing it to
continue the amount of money
that's being exchanged over

1265
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:48,080
between these banks.
The amount of influence these banks have,

1266
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:51,860
the decisions that have been made
directly because of the influence of these

1267
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:55,520
banks that have not benefited the
American people in any way, shape or form.

1268
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:59,990
All those things. When that's taken
into consideration in history,

1269
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,870
we're going to look back and
go, well, these were mad times,

1270
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:04,130
these were crazy people.

1271
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:08,210
And, and the thing is there's
this illusion of stability.

1272
01:16:08,211 --> 01:16:10,880
There's the solution that
because the system is so big,

1273
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,810
it can't possibly be fragile,
but the truth is exactly the opposite.

1274
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:17,570
It has become incredibly fragile.

1275
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:21,230
It is extremely overextended and
extremely fragile. And you see the,

1276
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,800
the Federal Reserve at the moment has
been pumping money into the economy like

1277
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:29,240
crazy for five years. And as they do
that, you get diminishing returns.

1278
01:16:29,241 --> 01:16:32,170
So every here they put the same
amount of money in and they,

1279
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:33,560
they move the economy,

1280
01:16:33,561 --> 01:16:37,280
they move the stock market a bit less
and then they put more money in and it

1281
01:16:37,281 --> 01:16:41,540
moves a bit lesson until they're
putting money in just to keep it stable.

1282
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:46,640
Now I've seen that pattern before.
I mean that looks like a cocaine habit

1283
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,910
right
in the first year,

1284
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:54,200
right?

1285
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,610
The coke addict is snorting a lot of
free Federal Reserve money and the stock

1286
01:16:58,611 --> 01:17:03,380
market's getting really high end
deeds. Bye Bye here. Five it takes a,

1287
01:17:03,381 --> 01:17:07,130
it takes a big fat line of Federal
Reserve money just just to keep the stock

1288
01:17:07,131 --> 01:17:10,580
market from crashing in the morning.
And then one day,

1289
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:15,200
which happens in mid October,
the Federal Reserve turned off

1290
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:18,380
the tap a month ago.

1291
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:22,850
Federal Reserve stopped giving
out free money to the banks.

1292
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,580
We haven't seen the effect that
will have in the stock market,

1293
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:29,560
but if you follow your
cocaine addict analysis, um,

1294
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:34,790
right now that addict is Jonesing for
a hit and is really, really cranky.

1295
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,010
So it means that things could happen.

1296
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:37,531
Yeah,

1297
01:17:37,531 --> 01:17:42,390
there are about seven to eight months
away from suck and trucker dicks and

1298
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:46,350
that's really what's going
on. I mean, they're about,
they're about that far away,

1299
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:51,660
but the amount of power that the bank has,
that's the federal bank,

1300
01:17:51,661 --> 01:17:52,441
the World Bank,

1301
01:17:52,441 --> 01:17:57,441
the amount of power all of them have
is really incredible and it should have

1302
01:17:58,471 --> 01:17:59,850
never taken place.
I mean,

1303
01:17:59,851 --> 01:18:03,110
the power is always supposed
to been something that was you.

1304
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,330
You're supposed to have the people
who choose a representative.

1305
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:11,160
The representative looks after the
will of the people. The people talk,

1306
01:18:11,161 --> 01:18:12,060
they have discourse.

1307
01:18:12,061 --> 01:18:16,320
There's debates and discussions and we'd
take into account social welfare and

1308
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:19,230
education and all these things that you
would like your money to be distributed

1309
01:18:19,231 --> 01:18:20,064
to.

1310
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:24,330
And instead what you
have is the money itself.

1311
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:29,640
Having this massive amount of power
and the people who print the money,

1312
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:35,010
having this massive amount of power
and generating, printing the money,

1313
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:40,350
but generating incredible sums of money
because the fact they print the money,

1314
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,540
which is when you see these fuckers,

1315
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:46,560
these Wall Street fuckers that are
living in these Hampton, these,

1316
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:50,070
they have these houses in the
Hamptons that are, I mean they're not,

1317
01:18:50,071 --> 01:18:52,670
they don't even look real.
If you ever seen some of those guys that,

1318
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:56,610
let me think of these. A thousand
fucking acres are hundreds of acres,

1319
01:18:56,611 --> 01:19:01,410
giant fucking palatial compounds and
you find a, what does this guy do? Oh,

1320
01:19:01,411 --> 01:19:03,330
he's just moving numbers or,
no,

1321
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,980
you got to realize, show that
they're not rich by world standards.

1322
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:10,520
They're not rich. The Pie, the
people who are really rich,

1323
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:16,210
they own islands and countries and they
don't even mingle with these little

1324
01:19:18,351 --> 01:19:21,800
small time bankers. It
here's, here's the thing.

1325
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,620
Sometime in the 20th century,
the,

1326
01:19:24,621 --> 01:19:28,850
this idea of governments being able to
print unlimited money was considered the

1327
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,290
scientific approach to money.

1328
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:34,400
That if somehow we could control things
a bit better in terms of tweaking

1329
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:37,910
interest rates and pouncing,
unemployment and inflation,

1330
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:43,060
we could use the scientific method in
terms of monetary policy because gold was

1331
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:46,730
too inefficient and you had to ship it
across the waters and big barges and

1332
01:19:46,731 --> 01:19:51,200
things like that. Yeah. If we could
use a scientific method for economics,

1333
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:56,090
we would see prosperity and we would see
growth and things like that. Instead,

1334
01:19:56,091 --> 01:20:00,800
what happens, governments had the
ability to print on limited money.

1335
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,860
So now they could go to
war without raising taxes.

1336
01:20:03,861 --> 01:20:07,500
And what they did is they went to war
again and again and again and again and

1337
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:08,310
again.

1338
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:12,660
And a lot of the money in the 20th
century was pumped directly into war,

1339
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,300
a war on scale with it.
Never happened before.

1340
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:18,420
And spending four on a scale
that had never happened before.

1341
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:22,760
And now you end up with economies
like the US. The U S is addicted tour.

1342
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:27,570
We've been at war continuously since 1930,
38,

1343
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:31,980
uh, pretty much continuously in
dozens and dozens of countries.

1344
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:37,050
And it is the machine that creates
stimulus. So anytime the economy starts,

1345
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,050
you know, we can in a bit,
we start another war and,

1346
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:44,670
and we get another enormous
amount of stimulus money. In fact,

1347
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:49,671
we saw recently the third quarter and
fourth quarter results for GDP are

1348
01:20:51,421 --> 01:20:56,421
presumably a bit better in the u s and
that happened to coincide with a massive

1349
01:20:57,031 --> 01:20:59,790
influx of money to fight isis.
You know,

1350
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:02,730
the latest bogey men,
by the way,

1351
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:07,740
Isis is the same organization we
funded against acid just a year ago.

1352
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:12,810
So ally enemy,
very quick transition.

1353
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,620
And now all of this money
going into fighting a new
enemy on a new battle front.

1354
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,530
But none of that money is going to
improve schools, roads, healthcare,

1355
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:25,680
or are the things in this country,
all of the government gets to print money.

1356
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,280
They use it for war every
time throughout history.

1357
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:34,550
And so the fact that governments were
freed from sound monetary policy and we're

1358
01:21:35,611 --> 01:21:40,050
given the ability to print infant as
money has ended up being a scourge on

1359
01:21:40,051 --> 01:21:40,621
humanity.

1360
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:45,390
It's ended up creating whore just for
profit because you don't need to tax

1361
01:21:45,391 --> 01:21:48,840
people to go to war and now you
don't need to conscript people.

1362
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:53,130
You can make it just the only employment
opportunity that exists in some states

1363
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:56,530
and Bingo,
you've got remote controlled,

1364
01:21:56,550 --> 01:22:01,320
highly profitable war that doesn't affect
the vast majority of the population

1365
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:05,940
and that has become the new
form of economic activity.

1366
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:12,590
That's one of the reasons why I think
that the same reason why states can't be

1367
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:15,420
trusted with religion,

1368
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:19,050
then you need separation of church and
state because when they take religion,

1369
01:22:19,051 --> 01:22:24,051
they use it as a form of power to beat
down people for the very same reason.

1370
01:22:24,241 --> 01:22:26,760
You need separation of state and money.

1371
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:29,280
When states and money became one,

1372
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:33,780
only bad things have happened and we
need to go back to some of the earlier

1373
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:34,111
times.

1374
01:22:34,111 --> 01:22:38,250
In fact that that's a weird thing about
bitcoin is this tremendously futuristic

1375
01:22:38,251 --> 01:22:41,520
technology one that neither
star trek or star wars, no,

1376
01:22:41,521 --> 01:22:45,900
the Jetsons predicted like all of
these truly disruptive technologies.

1377
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,090
It wasn't even imagined in Scifi,

1378
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:53,040
but its origins and its basis is actually
pretty conservative and traditional.

1379
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:58,041
It's the idea of money by the people
and for the people without it being

1380
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:00,030
nationalized.
State money.

1381
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,870
Ben Franklin as one of
the founding partners, a,

1382
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,190
our founding fathers

1383
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,630
was a printer, right? His main
business outside of, you know,

1384
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:13,420
being a rough solutionary and one
of the founding fathers was he,

1385
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:15,580
he ran a print shop,
he printed stuff.

1386
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:19,870
He run a whole empire of print shops
all across the, the United States.

1387
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:25,090
And one of the things he printed was money
because at the time money was made by

1388
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:28,930
banks and by states. So it wasn't
made by the federal government.

1389
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:31,960
The federal government
didn't have one money, right?

1390
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:36,280
Every state had its own and
Virginia money that was, you know,

1391
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:39,700
you have some money. That was main
money. That was Rhode Island money,

1392
01:23:39,701 --> 01:23:43,510
those New York money. Uh, and there
was also corporate money being printed,

1393
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,860
printed by companies.

1394
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:49,870
And that was one of the main reasons
that the British crown was pissed off was

1395
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:54,871
because all of these little free state
money printing operations where we're

1396
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:58,990
sucking taxes out of,
out of her queens money.

1397
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,540
Big Part of why the war started.
Right.

1398
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:05,260
And Ben Franklin was was the
original peer to peer money printer.

1399
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:07,930
Now bitcoin is doing,

1400
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:12,931
that's again only in a digital form and
governments tell us that can't possibly

1401
01:24:13,601 --> 01:24:16,240
work. What I would say the
evidence is the opposite. In fact,

1402
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:18,220
that worked pretty well for many,

1403
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:22,390
many centuries and this current model
is less than a hundred years old and has

1404
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:25,930
resulted in perpetual war
and terrible inflation,

1405
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:30,160
unemployment and depression. That
model can't work well. That model,

1406
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:31,450
not only can it not work,

1407
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:36,460
the people that are a part of that
model actively campaign against it,

1408
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:40,300
I mean everybody that runs for president
talks about how they want to stop war.

1409
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:43,420
We're going to pull out of Afghanistan,
we're going to close down Guantanamo Bay,

1410
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:46,570
we're going to do this and do that
and we're going to bring back peace.

1411
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:50,910
But meanwhile, the very machine that
puts them in place is a machine that's,

1412
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:56,050
that relies on more and needs war and
it's one of those things where you have a

1413
01:24:56,051 --> 01:25:01,051
path that is so deeply carved into the
ground that it's almost impossible if you

1414
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:06,640
traveling next to it, not the slide
into it. It becomes just this, this,

1415
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:10,840
there's money, it gets generated.
This is a way to get that money.

1416
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,310
This is a way to figuring out a way
to put it all together. And it just,

1417
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:16,090
it's a pattern.

1418
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:20,020
It's a pattern that's repeated itself
over and over and over again to the point

1419
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:24,700
where something disruptive has to be
introduced into the system. Excuse me,

1420
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:27,850
in order to stop that pattern
and create something new.

1421
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,740
And we begin to see that
because in the past, um,

1422
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:36,670
even the very communications of political
campaigns and elections were channeled

1423
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:40,660
through a few very narrow in our
channels like TV, right? And radio.

1424
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:45,670
And those gave the gatekeepers hell of
a lot of power because if they didn't

1425
01:25:45,671 --> 01:25:48,790
like political candidate,
they could just silence them.

1426
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:52,690
What the Internet did,
not successfully yet,

1427
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:57,370
but what it started doing is changing
that equation and allowing candidates who

1428
01:25:57,371 --> 01:26:01,660
otherwise wouldn't have a voice
to have a voice. You know.

1429
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:04,240
So for example, uh, the,

1430
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:09,320
the RNC broke their own rules at the
convention in order to keep Ron Paul from

1431
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:12,530
speaking back in 2008.
Right?

1432
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:14,900
But they couldn't stop him from speaking.

1433
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:19,790
And raising a lot of advocates
and followers on the Internet.

1434
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,850
They could keep him off TV,
they could keep him out of the debates,

1435
01:26:22,851 --> 01:26:25,490
they could keep him out of the
convention by breaking their own rules,

1436
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:27,080
but they couldn't keep
him off the Internet.

1437
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:31,580
And so the Internet allowed candidates
communicate directly with our

1438
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:32,450
constituents.

1439
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:37,940
Well now with Internet money you have
the ability to those constituents to fund

1440
01:26:37,941 --> 01:26:42,500
the campaigns directly and I guarantee
you it's going to be a tiny, tiny,

1441
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:43,850
tiny amount.
At first,

1442
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:48,970
just like initially internet
communications were negligible,

1443
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:52,610
trivial compared to TV spend.
Right.

1444
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:55,280
And then a couple of candidates
started changing that.

1445
01:26:55,281 --> 01:26:59,120
Howard Dean started running an Internet
based campaign from Paul Run an Internet

1446
01:26:59,121 --> 01:27:03,590
based campaign and even Obama himself
eventually ended up using the Internet to,

1447
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:06,440
to run his own campaign.
And your,

1448
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:10,910
and suddenly the Internet had influence
in communications. They're going to see,

1449
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:15,560
start seeing some politicians taking
bitcoin and other digital currencies for

1450
01:27:15,561 --> 01:27:18,350
the campaign finance. And at first
we're going to laugh at it, right?

1451
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:19,460
It's going to be ridiculous.

1452
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:23,360
It's going to be like a lemonade stand
taken on Walmart and then give it a

1453
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:28,361
decade and you could see a significant
shift in the source of money for campaign

1454
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:31,870
contributions. I think that's, you know,

1455
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:35,270
kind of interesting what could happen
there if you shift both the power of

1456
01:27:35,271 --> 01:27:38,930
communication and the power of
fundraising for elections to the people.

1457
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:39,931
Well,
I am,

1458
01:27:39,931 --> 01:27:43,560
whenever you have new
variables that people started
adopting and they get thrown

1459
01:27:43,561 --> 01:27:47,250
into the system and become a part of
the system and then become commonplace,

1460
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,640
it shakes things up. I mean, just
like the camera's that Nokia created,

1461
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:52,410
just like the Internet itself,

1462
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:57,560
essentially 1990 what fourish
people started adopting it.

1463
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,150
Let me, when was like, what was that?

1464
01:28:00,151 --> 01:28:03,970
Back then it was compuserve and AOL,
right?

1465
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,370
Just a few companies

1466
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:09,300
and Netscape fall.
It's by Yahoo and Altavista,

1467
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,740
which started creating
things that were interesting

1468
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:13,240
and 20 that's 20 years.

1469
01:28:13,241 --> 01:28:18,241
It's a blink of blink in time in the
world has changed so incredibly much so

1470
01:28:20,231 --> 01:28:24,320
much different than 1994 when it
comes to access to information. It's,

1471
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:28,180
it's impossible for
someone who is grown up.

1472
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:32,020
You talked to a 20 year old kid today and
explain to them what it was like to be

1473
01:28:32,021 --> 01:28:35,890
a 20 year old kid in 1985
and they'll laugh at you.

1474
01:28:35,891 --> 01:28:39,940
They can't see the world. How
could they, how could they write?

1475
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:42,580
When I tried to explain what it
was like for me to be 20 I'm like,

1476
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,280
I was like a monkey.

1477
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:48,850
I was like some dummy
with books like that was,

1478
01:28:48,851 --> 01:28:52,750
that was where you got your information
from books and from like things that you

1479
01:28:52,751 --> 01:28:57,430
would see on television that were on
television. Like you couldn't stop them,

1480
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:02,100
you couldn't rewind them, you
couldn't DVR them. Like the idea,

1481
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,070
the access to information did.

1482
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:09,080
The idea of information has shifted
so radically to Google on your phone.

1483
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:14,010
I mean that is,
that's so Jetsons.

1484
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:17,400
It's so beyond anything
anybody comprehended

1485
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,410
but Jetsons never imagined that.

1486
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:22,140
That's the interesting thing about it
is that if you look at some of these

1487
01:29:22,141 --> 01:29:23,430
disruptive technologies,

1488
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:27,990
things like the Jetsons and star Trek
and star wars and things like that,

1489
01:29:27,991 --> 01:29:32,490
they anticipate the current technology
and they just extrapolates linearly and

1490
01:29:32,491 --> 01:29:35,340
if, if the person is really a
visionary who comes up with it,

1491
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:40,020
sometimes they take a slight twist
and amplify one side of it and create

1492
01:29:40,021 --> 01:29:43,440
something exciting and then
they miss the simple things.

1493
01:29:43,441 --> 01:29:48,270
They miss the really obvious things. Like
they figured out mobile communicators,

1494
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:51,600
but they didn't figure
out email or social media.

1495
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,560
I was talking to someone who is saying
they wrote a book on the Jetsons,

1496
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:59,470
Jeffrey Tucker from Liberty Dot. Me.
He was, he was saying the, you know,

1497
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:03,120
one of the fascinating thing about the
Jetsons is that they would have flying

1498
01:30:03,121 --> 01:30:07,500
cars and pneumatic choose and
robots and all of these things,

1499
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:11,100
but when the kid took a note from
school back to his parents who would be

1500
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:13,660
written on paper,
yeah,

1501
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:19,400
they couldn't imagine email. Where is,
it seems obvious to us now. It was,

1502
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:23,220
it wasn't simply a continuation
of the past. It didn't have,

1503
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:27,690
it was completely new. And all of
the really interesting technologies,

1504
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,840
the ones that don't just take what you
have now and extrapolate that they break

1505
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:35,820
that mold completely and you
see like look at Star Trek,

1506
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:39,960
right? They just gave up on
money. They just gave up.

1507
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:44,160
They just don't talk about it at all.
There is no money in star trek. So true.

1508
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:47,880
They just fighting so much. What are the
Clinton's are looking for? Like crystals,

1509
01:30:47,881 --> 01:30:52,110
right? Well, I mean there's energy there.
There's all kinds of things, but you know,

1510
01:30:52,111 --> 01:30:56,550
they kind of gloss over money entirely
and that's because money's a different

1511
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:59,720
difficult technology to
imagine where it's going. And,

1512
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:03,150
and the same thing in a lot of Saifai,
you know,

1513
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:04,950
you don't see social media,

1514
01:31:04,951 --> 01:31:08,280
you don't see email and you certainly
don't see digital money as much.

1515
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:12,510
Or if people see digital money,
it's effectively apple pay, right?

1516
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:17,490
You have a thing and you'd go bloop
and it pays in galactic credits.

1517
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:22,690
But that's not very imaginative. That's
just our current money on a phone, right?

1518
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:25,800
Yeah, they're just using
placeholders. Right.

1519
01:31:26,370 --> 01:31:30,960
But the truly interesting technologies
start happening when you break that mold

1520
01:31:30,961 --> 01:31:33,430
and you create forms of money
that didn't exist before and,

1521
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,840
and ways to use money
that didn't exist before.

1522
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,720
So the ability,
for example,

1523
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:42,680
one of the really revolutionary
things about bitcoin that I,

1524
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:46,230
I find fascinating is the ability
for machines to own money.

1525
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:51,680
So up to now only people can own
money or through legal fiction,

1526
01:31:52,141 --> 01:31:54,720
it's like corporations,
groups of people can own money,

1527
01:31:55,680 --> 01:32:00,160
but machines cannot own, operate and
exchange money on their own. Software

1528
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:04,000
systems cannot own money on their own.

1529
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:07,180
They have to have a human
paying for things, right?

1530
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,070
So think about this concept which has
been discussed a lot in the bitcoin

1531
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:15,370
community called a distributed
autonomous corporation or decentralized

1532
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:20,030
autonomous corporation or
organization, Dao Dac. Um,

1533
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:26,250
imagine a software agent that is able
to maintain a bitcoin balance and uses

1534
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:31,300
that to pay for its own hosting on say,

1535
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:35,980
a web service. So you, so it
rents its own computer power.

1536
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:40,860
So you essentially empower the, the
software company, you, your servers,

1537
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:42,470
you write software,
right?

1538
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:47,200
So that it can manipulate
a bitcoin account and then
use that bitcoin account to

1539
01:32:47,201 --> 01:32:51,280
buy hosting to copy copies
of itself onto that hosting.

1540
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:56,020
Isn't that one then [inaudible] itself
is an autopay similar. Hang on a second.

1541
01:32:56,021 --> 01:32:58,330
Now imagine taking that a step further.

1542
01:32:58,630 --> 01:33:03,280
Now imagine if that software system
could create two varieties of itself,

1543
01:33:03,281 --> 01:33:06,950
like by making a small change
and one virus of the software,

1544
01:33:06,951 --> 01:33:11,110
it gets hosted here in one fair gets
hosted there and say it does an activity

1545
01:33:11,111 --> 01:33:11,590
like it,

1546
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:16,590
it creates content on blogs by
aggregating news and sells advertising for

1547
01:33:16,871 --> 01:33:21,130
Bitcoin. And if this one's successful,
it buys more hosting for itself.

1548
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:24,850
And if this one isn't successful,
it shrinks the amount of hosting.

1549
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:28,750
So now you've got almost a fitness
function, evolutionary effect going on.

1550
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:33,160
So now the most successful versions of
the software grow in size and fund more

1551
01:33:33,161 --> 01:33:37,630
of themselves now could go
out on craigslist and hire
some software developers

1552
01:33:37,631 --> 01:33:38,740
to make it software better.

1553
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:44,290
You've essentially got an autonomous agent
that's acting with money to propagate

1554
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:47,590
its own existence. That's
never happened before. And,

1555
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:52,420
and I don't know what you could do with
that. Uh, probably some very weird,

1556
01:33:52,421 --> 01:33:55,720
some very bad,
some very good things all mixed together,

1557
01:33:56,110 --> 01:34:01,110
but it opens a door to something that is
completely crazy Saifai level and when

1558
01:34:02,111 --> 01:34:04,360
you take that and you connect it to,

1559
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:09,220
I'm sure you've been paying attention to
the Ilan Musk statements that he's made

1560
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,160
recently about artificial
technology that it's a,

1561
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:17,340
you're summoning the demon and he believes
that within five years he ordinarily,

1562
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:22,270
I would read things like that and goes
some crazy futurist guys written really

1563
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:25,270
not, doesn't have his finger on the
pulse of the actual technology itself,

1564
01:34:25,271 --> 01:34:29,950
but when you got a guy like Elon Musk
who obviously is a fucking super genius

1565
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,980
and he starts saying things like that
you might take into consideration, hey,

1566
01:34:32,981 --> 01:34:36,460
maybe this guy is thinking
about some possibilities,

1567
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:40,630
some variables than other people are
just trying to ignore because we ignore a

1568
01:34:40,631 --> 01:34:44,440
lot of variables automatically. We ignore
the variable that we're going to die.

1569
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:48,310
We like to ignore that one. We sort of
know it exists, but we try to put it away.

1570
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:53,410
We ignore the variable that the earth
itself doesn't have a very long life.

1571
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,470
I mean in terms of cosmic viability,

1572
01:34:56,471 --> 01:34:59,080
it's like we gotta like
go another billion years.

1573
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,120
We can't support life anymore because
the sun's going to be too hot.

1574
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:05,270
It'll fucking eventually supernova
the whole year. You mean there's,

1575
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:09,050
there's only certain amount of time
for everything right now when you're

1576
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:14,051
creating intelligent life forms and you
are in creating essentially some sort of

1577
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:22,120
autonomous physical thing that is
going to be able to think for itself,

1578
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:27,140
you're going to have some sort of
thing that can mimic thinking or or,

1579
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:30,800
or actually has the ability to think,
propagate ideas,

1580
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,920
push forth its own agenda and do that on
its own and has bitcoin as money it can

1581
01:35:37,581 --> 01:35:42,530
think and it has a bank account and it
could think how to generate income and it

1582
01:35:42,531 --> 01:35:46,400
could think of what it could do with
that income to ensure that it keeps its

1583
01:35:46,401 --> 01:35:48,400
existence.
Well,

1584
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:52,410
there are ways you can think about
it and you know, for the time being,

1585
01:35:52,411 --> 01:35:56,490
the amount of action such an entity
could take in the physical world is very

1586
01:35:56,491 --> 01:36:00,000
limited. It needs people
to act as it's Asian. So,

1587
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:03,900
so some of the applications, you can put
it to a really interesting, for example,

1588
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:09,200
you can create a distributed charity
organization that has charitable members

1589
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:11,100
and built an endowment fund.

1590
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:16,580
And then can you use a vote among its
members to execute charitable action.

1591
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:22,130
So you can essentially have a corporation
that is programmable where it doesn't

1592
01:36:22,621 --> 01:36:24,690
depend on what a board of directors does,

1593
01:36:24,691 --> 01:36:29,691
but instead it has a code basis and all
of the shareholders get to vote directly

1594
01:36:29,821 --> 01:36:32,820
on what that does. And all
of the members say, oh,

1595
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:36,000
there was an earthquake in
this place in the world.

1596
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:41,750
75% of the members voted to send
part of the endowment for charitable

1597
01:36:42,511 --> 01:36:43,410
contributions.

1598
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:47,520
And now you have a charitable organization
that acts directly in the interest of

1599
01:36:47,521 --> 01:36:51,180
its members and contributors
without any influenced by a board.

1600
01:36:52,230 --> 01:36:55,430
That's kind of an interesting
concept. You can do some very, um,

1601
01:36:55,890 --> 01:37:00,890
you can use transparency
and accountability and
governance in interesting ways.

1602
01:37:00,901 --> 01:37:01,734
If you do that.

1603
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:05,250
There's a whole section of development
here called Bitcoin two dot.

1604
01:37:05,251 --> 01:37:08,850
O and the two dot Oh version of bitcoin.

1605
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:13,950
And I hate the term two. Dot. Oh.
Because you know, it's so overused.

1606
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:17,140
Web Two. Dot. O was social
media. It was kind of a, uh,

1607
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:21,780
a deviation from the standard pattern
of making publications centric sites to

1608
01:37:21,781 --> 01:37:23,260
making people centric sites.

1609
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:28,770
So bitcoin to Dodo is moving from
currency centric applications to contract

1610
01:37:30,121 --> 01:37:33,990
centric applications where instead
of running a currency on the network,

1611
01:37:33,991 --> 01:37:38,991
what you're running as a contract is
basically a piece of code that can execute

1612
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:44,810
contracts such as an agreement between
two people to buy and sell a house.

1613
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:49,470
And you can now take that and run
that as a contract on the network.

1614
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,670
And it can handle not just the payment
but also the registration of title,

1615
01:37:53,671 --> 01:37:56,970
the escrow,
things like you can have a contract.

1616
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,600
Here's one other application
as a company called Air Lock,

1617
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:04,770
which makes a digital
lock for airbnb locations,

1618
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,100
brand new company based on the
Bitcoin to doto technology.

1619
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:13,280
And the idea here is that you put a
digital lock on the door and when you sign

1620
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:19,590
the contract to rent an
airbnb location or something,

1621
01:38:19,591 --> 01:38:21,120
the tax like Airbnb,

1622
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:26,390
you send a payment of bitcoin and the
payment itself authorizes the pair to

1623
01:38:27,481 --> 01:38:28,590
unlock the door.

1624
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:33,740
So the same bitcoin keys you use to make
the payment now authorize you to open

1625
01:38:34,441 --> 01:38:39,000
the door to that property so you can
go and enjoy your stay for as long as

1626
01:38:39,001 --> 01:38:39,834
you've paid.

1627
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:45,380
So you've combined a smart currency with
a smart contract and a smart assets,

1628
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:51,000
which is the door lock.
So now you can open anything.

1629
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:56,430
Another company has built a fluid
dispenser, so it's a fluid dispense,

1630
01:38:56,431 --> 01:39:01,431
a where for a fixed price you can buy
certain number of gallons of something and

1631
01:39:01,531 --> 01:39:05,160
then dispense them simply by sending
a bitcoin payments to that pump.

1632
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:09,480
Essentially it can imagine this
for a gas pump, a water pump,

1633
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:14,340
hydrogen pump, you know, whatever you
want. And the thing that you can pump oil,

1634
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:19,260
high fructose corn syrup,
coffee whenever,

1635
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,910
and it's regulated by the amount
of Bitcoin that you've spent. Yeah.

1636
01:39:21,911 --> 01:39:26,040
So there's a ratio of
milliliters, leaders, gallons,

1637
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:28,380
fluid ounces or whatever
you want the unit to be,

1638
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:33,030
and a price for that particular
substance in that particular volume.

1639
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,800
And you pay for the volume and you,

1640
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:39,600
you then put a cop or car or
buckets underneath and dispense.

1641
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:43,410
Have any gas stations adopted bitcoin
yet? No. That would be fascinating.

1642
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:46,800
But you can see where the
possibilities go. Oh, finally,

1643
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:52,410
there's,
there's this concept of smart property,

1644
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:57,120
which I think we touched on it
before now. Uh, in June of this gear,

1645
01:39:57,121 --> 01:39:59,040
I sold my car for Bitcoin.

1646
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:04,650
And that in itself was a very
instructive, um, transaction.

1647
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:06,930
Because if you want to sell a car,

1648
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:11,970
you have a couple of really big
risk areas. If you're the buyer,

1649
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:15,840
you're going to a transaction with a
whole bundle of cash with you, right?

1650
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:18,030
And that means you can get robbed.

1651
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:21,000
And so it's pretty dangerous
when you're buying a car.

1652
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:23,610
You don't just randomly pick up an ad,
a Goto,

1653
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:27,870
a remote parking lot with
a bundle of cash. That's,
that's how people get killed,

1654
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:31,520
right? If you're a seller, if you don't,

1655
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:34,860
if you receive cash, you've got
to make sure it's not counterfeit.

1656
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,020
And most people can't tell the difference.

1657
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:41,580
So there's a big risk that you're
gonna receive a bunch of money,

1658
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,400
but that money isn't going to be real.
You give your car away,

1659
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:47,880
you have fake money,
you're in trouble now. Um,

1660
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:52,710
or if instead of taking cash, you want
to take a check, that check could bounce.

1661
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:56,950
If it's a bank draft, it could be forged.
If it's a money order, it could be faked.

1662
01:40:56,951 --> 01:41:01,951
So what you now need to do is arrange
to meet the car buyer near bank branch.

1663
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:07,150
Go in with the car buyer,
have them deposit the check or bank draft,

1664
01:41:07,151 --> 01:41:10,270
have the bank validated,
have the bank confirmed the amount.

1665
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:13,570
Now you can only do this between
nine and four 13 the afternoon,

1666
01:41:13,571 --> 01:41:14,560
Monday to Friday,

1667
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:20,830
I sold my car to 11:00 PM on a Wednesday
night and I sold it to someone who

1668
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:25,720
wasn't in the same state as I was buying
the car on behalf on behalf of his

1669
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:28,900
brother, who was a student in
the state where I was California.

1670
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:33,760
I meet the brother,
they do a test ride. Um,

1671
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:36,310
they call up their brother and say,
yeah, I really want to buy this.

1672
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:39,160
Can you send the bitcoin?
I send them the bitcoin address.

1673
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,110
We're in a parking lot in
the middle of the night.

1674
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:44,020
They're not worried I'm going to rob them
cause they don't have any cash on them.

1675
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:47,160
I'm not worried they're going to cheat
me because I'm going to see a bitcoin

1676
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:50,890
payment. So easy peasy,
really late at night.

1677
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:56,680
The brother does the transfer of
bitcoin. I told him, okay, wait here,

1678
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:01,090
I'm going to go grab a sandwich.
I'm going to be back in about 45 minutes.

1679
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:05,650
Once the bitcoin transaction is confirmed,
fully and settled can be reversed.

1680
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:10,510
Nothing. I'll be back 45 minutes
later, sandwich done back.

1681
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:15,430
I give them title and key and they
drive away. Transaction was safe.

1682
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:20,380
It had happened outside of banking hours.
Now here's the twist.

1683
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:21,590
Bitcoin to Dodo.

1684
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:26,840
You know a lot of cars today
have digital ignition systems,

1685
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,480
electronic ignition systems,

1686
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:32,140
so your key isn't just a metal key.

1687
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:37,620
It's also a radio transmitter that has
a special chip inside it to identify

1688
01:42:37,991 --> 01:42:42,580
itself to your car. So if you just
break the lock with a screwdriver,

1689
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:45,520
you're not going to start the car because
the electronic ignition system is not

1690
01:42:45,521 --> 01:42:48,310
going to recognize your key and
it's going to say no, sorry. Right?

1691
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,800
So the key itself is a digital key.

1692
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,950
Imagine if you could do the following.

1693
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:59,370
If I make a transaction
that transfers money,

1694
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:05,560
bitcoin to the owner of the car and the
owner of the car in the same transaction

1695
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,920
transfers a digital token back to me,

1696
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:12,060
and that digital token unlocks the car.
So now I,

1697
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:16,150
I execute the transaction.
The owner receives bitcoin.

1698
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:20,560
I received the digital token, I get
into the car, I pushed the start button.

1699
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:24,640
And because it can recognize that I have
that digital token, the car says, Oh,

1700
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:29,290
you're my new owner. Welcome. I
strive away from getting hacked.

1701
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:34,120
Well, that's the beauty of it. The
security isn't in the phone, right?

1702
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,820
That's what the bitcoin network does.

1703
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:39,490
It offers completely
decentralized security.

1704
01:43:39,491 --> 01:43:44,110
So in order for the Bitcoin to be
received by the owner and the token to be

1705
01:43:44,111 --> 01:43:47,890
transferred to me, that transaction has
to be verified by the bitcoin network.

1706
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,110
And that bitcoin network puts an enormous
amount of computation behind it to

1707
01:43:51,111 --> 01:43:52,040
make sure it's secure.

1708
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,950
Who's running that network?
All of the participants.

1709
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,660
So like right now when you did this car
thing, yes. How long ago did you does,

1710
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:04,910
this was in June. Um, you said to take
about 45 minutes for everything to,

1711
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:09,560
it took 45 minutes to settle. I saw
the transaction, instant seconds,

1712
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:10,670
right seconds.

1713
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,820
And then I needed to make sure
that it couldn't be reversed.

1714
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:14,870
So this is like for example,

1715
01:44:14,871 --> 01:44:17,420
when you deposit a check that
your balance updates immediately,

1716
01:44:17,421 --> 01:44:20,900
but it takes three to five days to settle.
In bitcoin,

1717
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:25,580
it takes six confirmations, which is
60 minutes of on average. In my case,

1718
01:44:25,581 --> 01:44:29,810
it took about 45 it was run.
Network is running a bit fast that day.

1719
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:35,330
So when that happens you say everyone on
the network that you're talking about,

1720
01:44:35,331 --> 01:44:38,170
all the people that are mining bitcoin,
all the people that are mining

1721
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:42,330
bitcoin or participating in securing it
and everybody else in the network also

1722
01:44:42,331 --> 01:44:43,560
independently fireflies it.

1723
01:44:43,561 --> 01:44:48,561
So after 60 minutes everyone on the
global bitcoin network knew that that

1724
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:50,790
bitcoin for the car was now mine

1725
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:54,880
and that is done. How like what
is the, the actual process,

1726
01:44:54,881 --> 01:44:59,050
what is it that goes through?
So you, you get the Bitcoin,

1727
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:03,730
it goes onto your phone,
then it gets verified. What's
happening? How's it getting

1728
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:09,290
the network verifies is it verifies that
bitcoin was transferred to an address

1729
01:45:09,961 --> 01:45:14,850
that I control and in that transaction
does a signature by the original owner

1730
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:19,830
and that signature transfers an existing
chain of bitcoin and the network

1731
01:45:19,831 --> 01:45:24,831
verifies that the bitcoin that they're
transferring to me exists and has not

1732
01:45:25,291 --> 01:45:28,740
been spent and has already
been recognized by the network.

1733
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:31,560
So it's basically building
a backwards chain.

1734
01:45:31,770 --> 01:45:36,480
My bitcoin exists because it was properly
signed from a piece of bitcoin that

1735
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:39,240
the person who sent it to me existed,

1736
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,580
which was properly signed
by the previous owner,

1737
01:45:41,581 --> 01:45:43,280
which was properly signed
by the previous owner,

1738
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:44,910
which was probably signed
by the previous owner.

1739
01:45:44,911 --> 01:45:48,840
You go back in time back to the point
where that bitcoin was mined for the first

1740
01:45:48,841 --> 01:45:52,050
time and because the network
validates that entire chain,

1741
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,540
once it's validated it,

1742
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:59,600
now I can spend it because I can sign it
over to someone else and they can trust

1743
01:45:59,851 --> 01:46:01,020
that that bitcoin is good.

1744
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:05,620
Wow. And, and it's some complex
math, but you know, here's the point.

1745
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:10,000
If I tried to explain to you how
a webpage lows on your browser,

1746
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:15,810
I would have to spend 20
minutes describing the border
gateway protocol routing

1747
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:21,870
algorithms a takes the TCP Ip packets
at your browser sentence uses the Ip

1748
01:46:22,781 --> 01:46:25,810
address to recognize the global route,

1749
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:30,400
also known as an autonomous system and
based on the subnets of that autonomous

1750
01:46:30,401 --> 01:46:35,290
system sends that packet to the nearest
routing system where a routing table

1751
01:46:35,291 --> 01:46:36,550
routes it to the next router,

1752
01:46:36,551 --> 01:46:40,150
etc. Until it arrives at the web
server that the points being,

1753
01:46:40,330 --> 01:46:42,550
you don't see any of that.
Not only that,

1754
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,460
I would still not get it and I would
just nod and pretend to understand what

1755
01:46:45,461 --> 01:46:50,130
you're saying. Like a dog, you're showing
card tricks too. It's the between using

1756
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,650
the technology and understanding
exactly how it works.

1757
01:46:52,651 --> 01:46:55,710
The truth is most people don't
even know how to grow a cucumber,

1758
01:46:55,711 --> 01:46:58,150
let alone how web server work.

1759
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,910
Well,
even if they know how to grow cucumber,

1760
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:04,470
they probably have no idea what is going
on inside the cucumber that's turning a

1761
01:47:04,471 --> 01:47:06,270
seed into a piece of vegetable.

1762
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:09,610
But you can still lead it and you can
still use a web browser and you can still

1763
01:47:09,611 --> 01:47:10,421
know the simple rule,

1764
01:47:10,421 --> 01:47:14,350
which is this after six confirmations
of my bitcoin transaction,

1765
01:47:14,351 --> 01:47:17,820
I can trust that I've got that
money in my, in my account done.

1766
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:21,580
So at that point I can give
the key over even better.

1767
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:24,640
If you take that to the Bitcoin
to dot Oh smart property,

1768
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:29,940
my car can recognize that it has a new
owner after six confirmation that the car

1769
01:47:30,311 --> 01:47:34,150
itself can independently calculate.
And say this transaction,

1770
01:47:34,151 --> 01:47:39,151
the transferred my title as a car to
a new owner has had six confirmations.

1771
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:43,420
Therefore I have a new owner and
if that owner shows up with a key,

1772
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:46,600
I will drive them away.
I will start my engine for them.

1773
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:48,640
And now the property itself,

1774
01:47:48,641 --> 01:47:52,930
the asset is smart enough to
track its owners through a chain.

1775
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:56,650
And that means it's,
it's much,

1776
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:59,130
much harder to steal that car.
Is this

1777
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:03,530
thing that the car owner or
the car dealers are creators
of the cars would have

1778
01:48:03,531 --> 01:48:05,690
to implement their own operating system?
Where would,

1779
01:48:05,691 --> 01:48:10,670
would this be using the same big coin
operating system inside the actual car for

1780
01:48:10,671 --> 01:48:14,210
it to recognize you wouldn't be,
yeah. You would be using the blog.

1781
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:18,850
You would replace the part where
the car recognizes a specific key.

1782
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:20,870
Hang on a second.
Yeah.

1783
01:48:20,871 --> 01:48:23,840
I have a little key that when I get in
my car knows you've got this kind of,

1784
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:28,820
this key actually has an RFID chip or
some other challenge response mechanism in

1785
01:48:28,821 --> 01:48:28,941
it.

1786
01:48:28,941 --> 01:48:33,941
So instead of the ignition
system interrogating this key,

1787
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:38,000
the ignition system would interrogate
an ownership record on the bitcoin

1788
01:48:38,001 --> 01:48:41,320
blockchain. When you, when
you see something like apple
pay with the thumbprint,

1789
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:43,370
print security and stuff like that,

1790
01:48:43,371 --> 01:48:47,850
do you see in the future of bitcoin
adopting some of those kind of McQueen can

1791
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:51,140
to NFC already so it can already
do the same thing as apple pay?

1792
01:48:51,170 --> 01:48:52,280
The big differences,

1793
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:56,090
you're not putting 300 million credit
cards into the ownership of a single

1794
01:48:56,091 --> 01:48:59,510
company that Jennifer
Lawrence is the picture.

1795
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:06,370
Right? Right. Yeah, so so
exactly. I mean that's,

1796
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,940
that represents a systemic risk and
that risk has nothing to do with whether

1797
01:49:09,941 --> 01:49:11,710
apple is good at what they do or not.

1798
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:15,190
It has to do with the fact that
credit cards are broken by design.

1799
01:49:15,191 --> 01:49:20,191
The fact that the number on a credit card
that you give to every merchant allows

1800
01:49:20,411 --> 01:49:23,860
them to go back into your account or
anybody who grabs that can go back into

1801
01:49:23,861 --> 01:49:25,840
your account.
That's a broken design.

1802
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:29,650
Essentially what you're doing is think
of your credit card as a password and

1803
01:49:29,651 --> 01:49:32,860
you're telling the password to everyone.
When you buy something,

1804
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:36,790
you giving people a key. Yeah,
exactly. A key to your house. Right.

1805
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:40,240
Whereas bitcoin is fundamentally different
because when you sign the transaction,

1806
01:49:40,241 --> 01:49:43,760
if they they can't change that transaction
and all they can do is take that

1807
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:47,980
amount for that payment.
Well that was one of the issue of banking

1808
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,270
online or doing anything online
was a huge deal just a decade ago.

1809
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:54,540
Like anybody would talk about buying.

1810
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:58,780
Like I used to buy things online in the
early two thousands and people would

1811
01:49:58,781 --> 01:50:01,450
look at me like I was crazy.
I got buy a tee shirt online,

1812
01:50:01,451 --> 01:50:03,220
use your credit card online.

1813
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:07,900
But because it depends on a centralized
model of trust where you have to trust

1814
01:50:07,901 --> 01:50:11,020
each intermediary in the chain.
That's one of the magic things here,

1815
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:15,430
which is that on a credit
card, if I transmit my credit
card from here to there,

1816
01:50:15,431 --> 01:50:16,600
that has to be encrypted,

1817
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:21,630
then that system transmits
it to a merchant processing
system is that connection

1818
01:50:22,271 --> 01:50:23,230
has to be encrypted.

1819
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,280
Then the mulch and pro serve transmits
it to the originating bank that has to be

1820
01:50:27,281 --> 01:50:28,000
encrypted.

1821
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,830
Everybody keeps a copy of that credit
card number on a database that has to be

1822
01:50:32,831 --> 01:50:37,210
encrypted surrounded by firewalls and
monitor it 24 seven because otherwise

1823
01:50:37,211 --> 01:50:40,720
target home depot, Jpmorgan Chase,
you know, again and again and again,

1824
01:50:40,721 --> 01:50:44,140
we see these hacks.
When I transmit a bitcoin transaction,

1825
01:50:44,141 --> 01:50:47,870
there's nothing secrets in it.
I can transmit it over unencrypted Wifi,

1826
01:50:47,871 --> 01:50:50,560
I can send it over Bluetooth,
I can play it as a music tone.

1827
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:55,360
I can send it to as a series of Skype
Smiley's that's my latest example.

1828
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:59,950
I can encode a bitcoin transaction is
15 emoticons and Skype and send it.

1829
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:03,910
It doesn't want any one cause
it's you just send it as a song.

1830
01:51:03,911 --> 01:51:07,840
Like you could send someone $1 million
in bitcoin through a song. Yes.

1831
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:13,020
So that send them pink Floyd's money and
have bitcoin $1 million in bitcoin and

1832
01:51:13,741 --> 01:51:18,250
coded. It's just a message. The
message itself can't be stolen.

1833
01:51:18,251 --> 01:51:20,650
So,
so that's the beauty of it.

1834
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:24,070
Now there's a protocol
for phones called Chirp,

1835
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,280
which converts data into a sound.

1836
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:31,870
And you can go into a store that supports
Chirp and there are implementations of

1837
01:51:31,871 --> 01:51:36,040
Bitcoin for Chirp where you go up to the
merchant and you press a button on your

1838
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:39,850
bitcoin wallet and it goes,
and that's your payment.

1839
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:44,710
That should always go to do doom,
doom, doom, doom, doom, doom,

1840
01:51:44,711 --> 01:51:49,520
doom instead of a cat sound. Hey,
well, yeah, it's a little modem. It's,

1841
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:54,400
it's like a modem, right? You remember
the old modem? Oh yeah. Screeching. Yeah,

1842
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:59,410
exactly. So 1414 14.4 bought.
I have one of those bitches.

1843
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:01,140
Well,

1844
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:06,140
schools sending money where you don't
need to encrypt the money means that you

1845
01:52:07,061 --> 01:52:09,010
can transmit it over anything.
So you've got,

1846
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,310
you've opened up all of the communication
media. When the merchant receives it,

1847
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:14,980
they don't need to protect it because
if they have a bunch of bitcoin

1848
01:52:14,981 --> 01:52:16,540
transactions on the database,

1849
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:20,110
those are the same bitcoin transactions
that are on the public ledger.

1850
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:23,110
I don't need to go to the march.
I could look them up on the public ledger.

1851
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:25,060
There's nothing secret about them.

1852
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:28,210
Everybody knows what they are and
so you don't have to hide them.

1853
01:52:28,211 --> 01:52:30,040
They can't be forged,
they can't be stolen.

1854
01:52:30,041 --> 01:52:34,870
There's no information by the consumer
transmitted that that actually becomes,

1855
01:52:35,110 --> 01:52:39,310
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, I may
be thinking about this incorrectly,

1856
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:44,470
but if someone sends you like say like
you know that u two album that got

1857
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:46,010
stuffed

1858
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,630
into everybody's Iphone,
if somebody sends you an album,

1859
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:53,150
those songs themselves,

1860
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:58,330
you can have those songs have the actual
value of the song embedded as bitcoin.

1861
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:05,120
Like it could be a thing that you have
and instead of it being something you can

1862
01:53:05,121 --> 01:53:08,330
copy, money has content, but
you what I'm saying? Yes.

1863
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:12,680
If it's completely embedded and
intertwined, if they're symbiotic,

1864
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:15,260
if this is,
it's something that cannot be copied.

1865
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:20,360
Like you can't take like say the big
issue with digital downloads is that you

1866
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:23,210
make an album and someone rips your album,

1867
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:25,820
puts it online and anybody
can make an infinite copies.

1868
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:31,030
But if it's digital money incorporated
into the actual song itself and that

1869
01:53:31,761 --> 01:53:33,500
cannot be done, well, no, you should.

1870
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:38,240
Individual one would be something that
is unique and unto itself is that,

1871
01:53:38,241 --> 01:53:39,200
does that make any sense?

1872
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:40,481
Possibly.

1873
01:53:40,481 --> 01:53:45,010
Although you could probably just strip
out the music and then copy just the

1874
01:53:45,011 --> 01:53:48,340
music sound. That's like DRM,
right? Yeah, exactly. It's like DRM.

1875
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:53,340
Soso Diarra it's not really useful for
Drm, right? Um, but it, but it is, uh,

1876
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:58,240
but you can now embed money as a
content type. So people who say,

1877
01:53:58,241 --> 01:54:02,440
you know, we're going to stop bitcoin
transactions from being transmitted.

1878
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:06,380
A bitcoin transaction is 250
bytes of information. Um,

1879
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,880
Skype has a 128 Smiley emoticons.

1880
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:14,590
That means I can confer to
bitcoin transaction to 16
smileys and as long as you

1881
01:54:14,591 --> 01:54:17,770
have the same code on the other end
to convert them back to a bitcoin

1882
01:54:17,771 --> 01:54:20,740
transaction and you have
access to a bitcoin network,

1883
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:25,180
I can send you as a 15 Smiley's. You can
take them, turn them into transaction,

1884
01:54:25,210 --> 01:54:28,210
put them on the network,
and that transaction will go through.

1885
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:31,030
So it's a kind could be living,
it's a code.

1886
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:35,290
I could be living in the most oppressive
country in the world and as long as I

1887
01:54:35,291 --> 01:54:40,291
can transmit 15 Smiley's across my border
or a s or 24 words in English or some

1888
01:54:44,471 --> 01:54:49,471
pixels in a picture or a
slight modification of the
red coloration of the Mona

1889
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:54,850
Lisa in a Jpeg,
I can transmit money.

1890
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:59,440
Whoa.
Porn can be money.

1891
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:03,820
Any information can be any information.

1892
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:07,660
You can put a song in a picture,
you can put a picture in a song,

1893
01:55:07,661 --> 01:55:10,440
you can put a video in a, did
you see what I mean? So now,

1894
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:15,550
so now money is one more
type of information that can
be transmitted across any

1895
01:55:15,551 --> 01:55:19,330
communication medium if that can
support the transmission of information.

1896
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:23,080
Cause I was an issue that we were having
with uploading things to iTunes and

1897
01:55:23,081 --> 01:55:27,250
including the image of the actual
pot, the podcast image itself. Right.

1898
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,540
We have an issue with that.

1899
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:32,840
Yeah. Order MP three players didn't
understand extra information. Right?

1900
01:55:33,250 --> 01:55:36,950
They didn't understand the, the digital
and information on the photograph of the,

1901
01:55:36,951 --> 01:55:38,020
you know, the, the cover or

1902
01:55:38,260 --> 01:55:40,960
cover art. Right. Which is a
matter of simply being able,

1903
01:55:41,170 --> 01:55:45,510
having the rights in coding and decoding
the two ends of the transaction. But,

1904
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:49,860
um, yeah. Here, here's
another really cool one.

1905
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:55,670
You can now create a bitcoin wallet as
represented by either 12 or 24 words from

1906
01:55:58,711 --> 01:56:02,160
an an English dictionary
specific dictionary. It has,

1907
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:04,170
I don't remember how many words it has.

1908
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:07,620
I think it's like several thousand words,

1909
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:13,280
specific dictionary of words where each
word has a specific number and without

1910
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:15,060
dictionary.
If you have that dictionary,

1911
01:56:15,061 --> 01:56:17,610
which you can download as a
pdf and it's exists online,

1912
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:21,060
12 words create a bitcoin wallet.

1913
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:24,420
So it's not just a matter of
transmitting a single transaction.

1914
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:27,540
You can transfer the entire
contents of your wallet or backups,

1915
01:56:27,541 --> 01:56:31,710
your Wallet as 12 English
words. So now, potato,

1916
01:56:31,711 --> 01:56:36,510
asparagus, army, caravan, door, carpet,

1917
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,910
screwdriver,
lemon.

1918
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,920
FICUS is a wallet.

1919
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:48,060
And if I say those 12 words to
someone who knows that it's a wallet,

1920
01:56:48,061 --> 01:56:50,730
they can take that to recreate
not just one transaction,

1921
01:56:50,731 --> 01:56:53,100
but all of the transaction,
all of the addresses,

1922
01:56:53,101 --> 01:56:55,410
all of the money that's in that wallet.

1923
01:56:55,680 --> 01:57:00,680
I can transfer the entire account or
millions of accounts on the same system in

1924
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:05,730
12 words. That's fucking insane.
Can I put those 12 words?

1925
01:57:06,450 --> 01:57:09,150
I could spray paint them on the wall.
I could put them on a poster.

1926
01:57:09,151 --> 01:57:09,981
I could transmit them.

1927
01:57:09,981 --> 01:57:12,450
Now obviously that's a secret
you don't want to tell everybody,

1928
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:18,020
but I could just simply send you a
book and then send you a series of

1929
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:22,350
coordinates, you know, page 35
second word, first paragraph,

1930
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:25,050
and now you have a bitcoin
wallet to the form of a book.

1931
01:57:25,630 --> 01:57:26,210
It's incredible.

1932
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:29,890
You could send me a photograph like
you could be on vacation and send me a

1933
01:57:29,891 --> 01:57:33,370
photograph and the bitcoin
money could be embedded in that.

1934
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:38,170
The information of that photograph being
sent to someone else's phone in just a

1935
01:57:38,171 --> 01:57:43,120
slight hue variation in the
red coloration of a photo. Yes,

1936
01:57:43,390 --> 01:57:46,910
that's a more, any of the colors. You
could just modify a couple of the pixels.

1937
01:57:46,930 --> 01:57:49,000
You can do that with anything.
Now if you have that code,

1938
01:57:49,001 --> 01:57:51,520
it's just like Morse code.
It's called steganography.

1939
01:57:51,521 --> 01:57:54,880
It's its secret writing
within some other form.

1940
01:57:54,881 --> 01:57:58,950
And it's been done for Ashley for a
very long time. For centuries. Well,

1941
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,900
that was an issue with a,

1942
01:58:00,970 --> 01:58:05,110
supposedly with Osama bin Laden and
how they were transferring information

1943
01:58:05,111 --> 01:58:08,730
online through, we're doing it through
jpegs. Right. Wasn't that like a,

1944
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:12,130
one of the big ways to do or yes.
Among others.

1945
01:58:12,131 --> 01:58:14,140
I think they use it actually
the first people to do

1946
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:18,220
do this war Franciscan monks who,
who would write, uh, you know,

1947
01:58:18,221 --> 01:58:22,510
copies of the Bible and that they'd
write it so that the first letter of each

1948
01:58:22,511 --> 01:58:25,060
sentence vertically
spelled something else.

1949
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:29,730
So they put a hidden message within
the Bible. Right. So it goes,

1950
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:31,880
it goes back a bit further than us.

1951
01:58:31,881 --> 01:58:35,550
Some I've been loud as some part of
what the Da Vinci Code is based on.

1952
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,050
I got a secret writing as is
another dart. Well, I mean,

1953
01:58:40,051 --> 01:58:42,100
that's essentially how they got

1954
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:46,600
away with transferring information during
the World War One and World War II era.

1955
01:58:46,601 --> 01:58:49,360
Right. When they were like Dee Dee
Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee, they had a,

1956
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:52,210
they had a deep code.
A lot of what they're morse code was,

1957
01:58:52,211 --> 01:58:55,660
would they were actually saying,
yeah,

1958
01:58:55,661 --> 01:59:00,640
all that I knew. But for whatever
reason, this has blown me away.

1959
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:05,670
This idea of taking information and
betting it in either a song or photograph

1960
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:11,650
and that becoming a bitcoin transaction.
Yeah, that's freaking me out.

1961
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:16,270
And you could put it anywhere. You could
put a bitcoin transaction into anything.

1962
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:18,040
Um,
so for example,

1963
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:21,520
imagine if you have an oppressive
government and they're trying to block all

1964
01:59:21,521 --> 01:59:23,010
external internet.
How about the Keisha?

1965
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,690
And imagine if you don't,
is there,

1966
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:30,040
is there a fucking government that isn't
oppressive anymore? Okay? You know,

1967
01:59:30,041 --> 01:59:32,290
I mean, everyone's, imagine
an oppressive government.

1968
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:35,590
Imagine one that's completely banned,
all Internet rights,

1969
01:59:35,610 --> 01:59:39,750
and you've shut down the internet and
you want to do bitcoin transactions in

1970
01:59:39,751 --> 01:59:42,780
that country. You're really
motivated, right to you. You,

1971
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:46,920
you want to buy spray cans to spray
your revolutionary message on the wall.

1972
01:59:46,921 --> 01:59:50,340
That's, let's use an a
nonviolence example. Okay? Um,

1973
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:54,510
so now what you can do is as long as
you have a country next door that has a

1974
01:59:54,511 --> 01:59:58,410
shortwave receiver with someone
willing to put messages on the Bitcoin

1975
01:59:58,411 --> 01:59:59,100
blockchain,

1976
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:03,450
you could transmit a bitcoin transaction
over short wave with like morse,

1977
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:06,840
with a radio, and you could
do it in a matter of seconds.

1978
02:00:06,841 --> 02:00:09,960
So you could make your entire
transmission in 25 seconds.

1979
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:11,610
So now you start going into,

1980
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:15,240
they did this in France
during the Nazi occupation,

1981
02:00:15,241 --> 02:00:19,830
the allies drop tens of thousands of
shortwave radios with parachutes to the

1982
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:24,630
participant resistance, the French
resistance and the participants would

1983
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:31,080
go out into the middle of
the woods, hookup there,
radio antenna to a rail line,

1984
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:35,040
a railroad line, a long piece of
steel that acts as an antenna,

1985
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:39,030
burst the short wave transmission and
transmit for a few minutes, disconnect,

1986
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:40,170
disappearance of the woods.

1987
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:43,200
And there's no way you can find
them or stop them or do that.

1988
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:47,640
Then I could do that with money.
Wow.

1989
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:52,590
That is fucking wild.
That's a boy.

1990
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:55,610
That's something I never
even took into consideration.

1991
02:00:55,611 --> 02:00:59,750
And that's something once money starts
being adopted by more and more companies

1992
02:00:59,751 --> 02:01:02,630
and more and more people started using
it for more and more transactions,

1993
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,720
that's something that could
be real paradigm shifting.

1994
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:08,890
There's a,
I mean that's the,

1995
02:01:09,010 --> 02:01:13,630
this is the idea of the rabbit hole.
You know,

1996
02:01:13,640 --> 02:01:14,980
bitcoins is,

1997
02:01:14,981 --> 02:01:19,210
at first it strikes you as something
very simplistic gets a series of digital

1998
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:20,720
information.

1999
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:23,580
It's some numbers and you send them
and you and you make a transaction.

2000
02:01:23,610 --> 02:01:28,200
So it's money as email. Okay, fine. But
then if you go deeper and you see the,

2001
02:01:28,201 --> 02:01:30,610
the way it's structured
without knowing intermediaries,

2002
02:01:30,611 --> 02:01:32,680
the way it works is a
decentralized network.

2003
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:36,100
The way it turns money into information,
the more you think about it,

2004
02:01:36,101 --> 02:01:37,480
the more you go down the rabbit hole,

2005
02:01:37,481 --> 02:01:42,481
the more you realize that structures and
constraints that exist today are wiped

2006
02:01:43,281 --> 02:01:47,810
away or blown away by this thing
and it opens up these possibilities.

2007
02:01:48,410 --> 02:01:51,080
And the really interesting ones
are the ones we can't imagine.

2008
02:01:51,081 --> 02:01:55,430
The ones that are not an extension of
what we do today but are completely novel

2009
02:01:55,431 --> 02:01:56,440
have never happened.

2010
02:01:56,470 --> 02:02:00,770
But in the sense that it parallels the
Internet itself in that regard. Right,

2011
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:04,370
and that's the main argument I'm trying
to make that this is not money for the

2012
02:02:04,371 --> 02:02:07,640
Internet. This is the
internet of money. Whoa.

2013
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:11,840
It is a platform on top of which
you can build applications.

2014
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:15,320
Currency is just the first APP.
There will be more apps,

2015
02:02:15,321 --> 02:02:19,640
there'll be stock ops and fallen
gaps and a smart property apps.

2016
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:23,520
Okay, so to use the internet as an
analogy, like what year are we in?

2017
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:25,950
We in the 1995 of the Internet,

2018
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:28,620
I I, my estimate has been
consistent over the last year.

2019
02:02:28,621 --> 02:02:33,390
I've been talking about this being the
1992 to 1994 period they have to face is

2020
02:02:33,391 --> 02:02:34,440
a pretty rough,

2021
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:39,810
the major paradigm shifting companies
and innovations haven't happened yet.

2022
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,450
The web hasn't happened where the,

2023
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:45,090
we're still on Ip addresses
is that of DNS names.

2024
02:02:45,690 --> 02:02:50,340
That's why the Bitcoin is
restful interface hasn't
been developed yet. Right.

2025
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:54,090
It's gnarly. It's weird.
It's esoteric, it's Geeky.

2026
02:02:54,091 --> 02:02:58,050
Most people haven't heard about it.
The big money hasn't come in,

2027
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:01,320
but all of the technology
potential is already there.

2028
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:04,410
And the adoption has
already reached technology,

2029
02:03:04,411 --> 02:03:08,520
critical mass meaning that uh,
someone said recently at the conference,

2030
02:03:08,521 --> 02:03:11,070
we're not the early adopters
where the lunatic fringe,

2031
02:03:11,071 --> 02:03:12,480
the early adopters come later.

2032
02:03:16,030 --> 02:03:17,630
I got to turn higher primary

2033
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:21,600
Dotcom, Bitcoin, I'm writing
a note cause he's a paypal.

2034
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:26,520
You may be able to, you might be able
to just do it by turning on paypal now,

2035
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:29,700
um, I don't know if their Beta
program is, is ready for that,

2036
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,630
but it's not that the Falcon Bard is sons
of bitches and I'm going to get on on

2037
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:36,660
in as well kept on it to start drilling.

2038
02:03:36,750 --> 02:03:39,420
I can't do anything about comedy
central about my new special,

2039
02:03:39,421 --> 02:03:42,270
but those things I can do something,

2040
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:47,060
I dunno man. You have, you,
you have as a content creator,

2041
02:03:47,061 --> 02:03:51,650
I think you'll find that a publishers
are open to new exciting and it's,

2042
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:53,660
I'm out their ideas,

2043
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,960
I think you have the opportunity to go
chat with some of them and say, Hey,

2044
02:03:56,961 --> 02:04:00,500
you don't want to try something new.
I've definitely have a chat to them.

2045
02:04:00,501 --> 02:04:01,350
And then they get,
oh,

2046
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:06,170
there's that fucking pothead cage fighting
commentator idiot who's covered in

2047
02:04:06,171 --> 02:04:09,320
tattoos. Let's just not listen to him and
keep making millions. Get out of here,

2048
02:04:09,321 --> 02:04:12,170
kid.
They're not going to listen to me.

2049
02:04:12,350 --> 02:04:17,350
That's certainly a familiar sentiment
for me because I felt that before you can

2050
02:04:17,421 --> 02:04:21,350
now pump gas for bitcoin in the rocky
mountains. Powerful rocky mountains.

2051
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:23,990
Where is this that's happening?
Uh,

2052
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:30,960
it's the Colorado in Greeley, Colorado,
of course called the cosmic market.

2053
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:32,670
Well, you know, it's interesting. Greeley,

2054
02:04:32,671 --> 02:04:36,960
Colorado is one of those
towns that doesn't want
marijuana there. Those fucking,

2055
02:04:37,730 --> 02:04:38,130
there's

2056
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:42,470
one of the towns is trying
to keep marijuana out. See
how well, you know, the,

2057
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:46,380
they're worried that it's going to be a
bunch of hooligans and Ne'er do wells.

2058
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:51,420
Meanwhile, that has changed
Colorado in a goddamn traumatic way.

2059
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:55,860
It was beautiful being back there and
seeing all the businesses that are

2060
02:04:55,861 --> 02:05:00,480
spawning out of this, this legalized
marijuana movement. And again,

2061
02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:04,860
it's another, it's another example of
what happens when you give people freedom.

2062
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:09,720
You know, can you buy pot with
bitcoin? Goddamn revolutionary. Really?

2063
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:13,360
Oh absolutely. Cause la speed, we'd
use bit coin, you know, I don't know.

2064
02:05:13,390 --> 02:05:17,100
She needs to get on that shit.
You could buy gas cards also a coin,

2065
02:05:17,101 --> 02:05:21,310
fuel.com you can buy any
kind of gas cards. Yeah.

2066
02:05:21,350 --> 02:05:25,010
Any kind of gas card with bitcoin.
Look at the, did you know about this?

2067
02:05:25,011 --> 02:05:30,011
So the real question now is can you buy
x with bitcoin directly or can you buy x

2068
02:05:30,781 --> 02:05:33,090
with Bitcoin?
Fire an intermediary.

2069
02:05:33,091 --> 02:05:36,330
That's the only difference cause you can
pretty much buy anything with bitcoin.

2070
02:05:36,331 --> 02:05:38,760
Now the question is how
many conversions do you do?

2071
02:05:38,970 --> 02:05:43,970
Do you need to convert bitcoin into a
currency or a gift card or a report point

2072
02:05:44,491 --> 02:05:48,900
miles or something else? Cysto or
some kind of customer loyalty program?

2073
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:52,830
Or does someone else buy the product
for you and you'll give them bitcoin and

2074
02:05:52,831 --> 02:05:56,190
intermediary? Or can you give
bitcoin to the merchant directly?

2075
02:05:56,191 --> 02:06:00,350
So there's all of these shades, right?
But in terms of Kenyan by x with Bitcoin,

2076
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:04,200
the answer is yes, there's an escort
for bitcoin time still not open yet.

2077
02:06:04,201 --> 02:06:07,140
Escort for bitcoin daughter trying
to figure it out. Meanwhile,

2078
02:06:07,141 --> 02:06:11,520
those are some digital bitches
are very shady. There's, you know,

2079
02:06:11,521 --> 02:06:13,080
those are undercover cops
because they're like,

2080
02:06:13,081 --> 02:06:14,790
why would they go through
the exter? Like, Hey,

2081
02:06:14,791 --> 02:06:18,480
we're going to make it only bitcoin
guy trying to crash gamergate. I Dunno.

2082
02:06:18,910 --> 02:06:21,990
This is the, there'll be the
first digital STDs that you get.

2083
02:06:22,470 --> 02:06:25,380
We'll get into your bitcoin wallet.
Fuck it all up.

2084
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:31,830
I think it's amazing. I mean,
since you started coming on here,

2085
02:06:31,831 --> 02:06:34,770
which was a over a year ago,
the very first appearance,

2086
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:39,510
we've seen quite a shift in
the accessibility of bitcoin.

2087
02:06:39,690 --> 02:06:44,160
The ability to buy things with bitcoin.
The, the people, uh, accepting Bitcoin,

2088
02:06:44,161 --> 02:06:48,630
the acceptibility and the discussion of
Bitcoin is escalated. It's, it's elevated.

2089
02:06:48,631 --> 02:06:50,610
I think that discussion is less about,

2090
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:55,560
I think there's less ignorance and
less just blatant misrepresentation.

2091
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:56,370
So a here,

2092
02:06:56,370 --> 02:06:59,520
regardless having these discussions and
people were asking questions like, well,

2093
02:06:59,521 --> 02:07:04,380
why cans touching a Komodo? Just come
in and take all the bitcoin and um,

2094
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:09,560
you know, won't this only be used by
terrorists and pornographers? My people.

2095
02:07:09,870 --> 02:07:13,420
And you know, that was the, that was the
conversation. Now we've elevated a bear.

2096
02:07:13,421 --> 02:07:18,421
So the funny thing is that people are are
beginning to recognize that they can't

2097
02:07:18,511 --> 02:07:20,910
simply dismiss bitcoin out of hand.

2098
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:24,990
So what they do is they tried to split
hairs that like, yeah, well you know,

2099
02:07:24,991 --> 02:07:29,300
the technology of the blockchain
is really fascinating, but bitcoin,

2100
02:07:29,310 --> 02:07:32,490
the currency will obvious obviously fail.
So they're splitting hairs.

2101
02:07:32,491 --> 02:07:36,070
Now give him another year, we're
going to come around. Of course, those

2102
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,490
of us who have been in this for a while
on the stand that the technology and the

2103
02:07:39,491 --> 02:07:42,640
currency,
our goal like hand in hand,

2104
02:07:42,641 --> 02:07:46,640
you can't have a successful technology
without a valuable currency and vice a

2105
02:07:46,641 --> 02:07:47,380
versa,

2106
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:52,300
but you're beginning to see the naysayers
tried to split hairs because they can

2107
02:07:52,301 --> 02:07:56,020
no longer say there's nothing there. They
can no longer say this is just a joke.

2108
02:07:56,021 --> 02:08:00,250
Because many,
many very smart,

2109
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:04,690
intelligent, well educated, well
informed people are saying, hang on,

2110
02:08:04,990 --> 02:08:09,610
this isn't a joke. There is something
interesting about this technology.

2111
02:08:09,611 --> 02:08:14,611
There's something disruptive about this
technology and we're looking into it's

2112
02:08:14,701 --> 02:08:17,310
seriously and after you see a bunch of,
you know,

2113
02:08:17,710 --> 02:08:20,440
we shouldn't do appeal by authority,
this should stand on its own.

2114
02:08:20,441 --> 02:08:23,680
It either is or it isn't,
but the truth is that in our culture,

2115
02:08:23,681 --> 02:08:26,950
we do appeal by authority.
When paypal comes along and says,

2116
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:30,700
there's something here and we're
going to invest in at overstock, Dell,

2117
02:08:30,701 --> 02:08:34,210
tiger direct, you know,
one after the other.

2118
02:08:34,230 --> 02:08:38,360
These companies turn around
your, you say, well, you know,

2119
02:08:38,410 --> 02:08:41,890
these are not dumb people. These are
not people who don't understand money.

2120
02:08:41,891 --> 02:08:44,080
These are not the lunatic fringe anymore.

2121
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:47,500
They're the early adopters and
the conversation has changed.

2122
02:08:47,890 --> 02:08:52,060
Do you remember when we did our first
show? Apple banned bitcoin applications?

2123
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:57,040
Yes. They reverted that four
months ago. Five months ago.

2124
02:08:57,250 --> 02:09:01,510
They had to change their stance and now
there are dozens of bitcoin wallets.

2125
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:03,930
I predicted that they would switch their,
predict that,

2126
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:07,660
but I've read that the reason why they
did was because there was some fuckery

2127
02:09:07,661 --> 02:09:12,100
involved in the actual coding
of the software itself and
that they weren't being

2128
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:16,800
entirely accurate about what the software
was capable of doing. Oh, there was a,

2129
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:21,460
I mean when they were being very
difficult about bitcoin applications,

2130
02:09:21,461 --> 02:09:23,080
a lot of the bitcoin applications,

2131
02:09:23,081 --> 02:09:25,690
we're kind of trying to find
loopholes here and there.

2132
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:30,990
One of the funniest I saw was that apple
had a whole different set of rules.

2133
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:35,140
If you have a co op,
so if you have a co op,

2134
02:09:35,141 --> 02:09:39,400
you can distribute software to your club
members without putting it through the

2135
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:40,900
apple iTunes store.

2136
02:09:41,230 --> 02:09:44,770
So someone set up a bitcoin wallet
that's you sign up by email to become a

2137
02:09:44,771 --> 02:09:48,000
member of the co op and they
said the APP by email, right?

2138
02:09:48,001 --> 02:09:50,440
So people were doing all kinds
of shenanigans like that.

2139
02:09:50,441 --> 02:09:53,260
But really the real reason for this,

2140
02:09:53,261 --> 02:09:58,090
and we said that six months ago was apple
was going to launch apple pay and they

2141
02:09:58,091 --> 02:10:03,091
didn't need a whole bunch of insurgent
little Weirdo applications earnings,

2142
02:10:04,991 --> 02:10:08,590
their announcement.
So until the last moment they resisted,

2143
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:11,320
they wanted to keep control over payments,

2144
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:16,030
both in store payments where they make
a very healthy 30% cots on every APP and

2145
02:10:16,031 --> 02:10:17,500
every in store purchase.

2146
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:21,400
And they wanted to introduce their
own payments and wallet technology.

2147
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:23,170
And so they did that.

2148
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:28,030
So now apple has created compuserve
and we still have the intranet.

2149
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:31,120
Now we can play on a level playing field.
Let's see who wins.

2150
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:35,900
I have my bets on the Internet. Not you
serve of money. That's what I propel.

2151
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:38,030
That's what apple pay does,
right?

2152
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:42,920
They have a number of 300 million
credit cards subscribers who have the

2153
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:48,020
steroidal curated walled
garden controlled experience.

2154
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:52,760
And then there's bitcoin. The works
internationally that is wide open.

2155
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:57,140
That doesn't do all of that. I have
my credit cards on my, my wallet.

2156
02:10:57,141 --> 02:11:00,980
I used it the other day for my first time.
This is the apple pay apple pay thing.

2157
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:03,710
Jamie,
can you get some whiskey and ice?

2158
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:07,360
I'm trying to do something with my voice
here. Put it in the microwave. Hello. No,

2159
02:11:07,450 --> 02:11:12,170
no, I don't want, I want it cold. That's
why I fuck put it in the microwave. Yeah,

2160
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:15,440
it's good for your throat. Warm
Melt. The ice. Who are you?

2161
02:11:16,430 --> 02:11:20,660
So when you, when you use this, did
it, did it do anything? It was just,

2162
02:11:20,661 --> 02:11:23,810
you just kind of swiped it
over the thing and it just,

2163
02:11:23,811 --> 02:11:26,900
you only certain vendors that works on
you can't, you can't do it everywhere,

2164
02:11:26,901 --> 02:11:27,170
right?

2165
02:11:27,170 --> 02:11:31,050
It's any of the credit card machines
where you usually swipe your own card. Uh,

2166
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:34,190
most of the newer ones
have a little symbol on it.

2167
02:11:34,191 --> 02:11:39,191
That means it has the little Wifi as
this remote control Nis or whatever it's

2168
02:11:39,261 --> 02:11:43,640
called, right? That's NFC as
pay waste system or tap and pay.

2169
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:48,020
Now here's the interesting thing.
Apple launched apple pay and Google,

2170
02:11:48,021 --> 02:11:49,280
which has Google wallet,

2171
02:11:49,550 --> 02:11:53,570
had seen very few subscribers and
as soon as apple pay launched,

2172
02:11:53,630 --> 02:11:56,840
Google subscriber numbers shot through
the roof because you can do the same

2173
02:11:56,841 --> 02:12:01,841
thing on android and I'm really banking
on that effect because apple will will

2174
02:12:02,001 --> 02:12:04,220
make people familiar with mobile wallets,

2175
02:12:04,221 --> 02:12:06,740
the idea of tap and pay with their thing,

2176
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:09,620
but they still have many
of the same problems.

2177
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:12,860
Apple has all of these credit
cards that have vulnerable,

2178
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:17,270
they track all of your purchases and
everything you do and they're going to

2179
02:12:17,271 --> 02:12:20,960
impose restrictions on what the things
you can pay and what merchants you can

2180
02:12:20,961 --> 02:12:24,050
pay and you've still got all of
the old players, visa, mastercard,

2181
02:12:24,051 --> 02:12:27,980
American Express, all of the problematic
payment networks that are restrictive.

2182
02:12:28,130 --> 02:12:32,570
They have $5 minimums.
They're very expensive for
merchants. You can have fraud,

2183
02:12:32,690 --> 02:12:33,530
all of these things,

2184
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:39,280
but what they're doing is
they're familiarizing people
with PE and NFC and we

2185
02:12:39,501 --> 02:12:41,030
can do that with bitcoin too.

2186
02:12:41,090 --> 02:12:46,090
Only we can give them the full experience
from micropayments to cross border

2187
02:12:46,191 --> 02:12:49,920
transactions to countries they've
never heard of to you know,

2188
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:52,520
the full bitcoin experience.
I see what you say.

2189
02:12:52,521 --> 02:12:56,900
It's compuserve versus the
intranet or compuserve and AOL.

2190
02:12:56,901 --> 02:12:58,940
Internet's golf people. Anybody
who wants do you want some of this?

2191
02:13:01,370 --> 02:13:06,370
Got People used to the idea of email in
a safe kind of curated environment like

2192
02:13:08,571 --> 02:13:13,010
a sandbox and once they did what they
really wanted was the full internet email

2193
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:16,820
because the open technology
innovates faster.

2194
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:22,240
It has broader scale is less fragile
and it has more participation.

2195
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:24,620
And so same thing applies to bitcoin.

2196
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:29,860
Do you think iPhone is going to be the
platform of choice for the four to 6

2197
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:36,040
billion unbanked people in Indonesia
and the Philippines in Subsaharan Africa

2198
02:13:36,601 --> 02:13:38,700
and South Africa and Latin America?
Hell No.

2199
02:13:38,850 --> 02:13:41,970
It's going to be android with bitcoin.
It's not going to be apple pay.

2200
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:47,340
And that's fine because apple pay has a
role to play and will familiarize people

2201
02:13:47,341 --> 02:13:50,940
with this technology and get people
to start thinking of money as a purely

2202
02:13:50,941 --> 02:13:51,900
digital thing.

2203
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:57,170
And then we come along and we deploy
bitcoin on $20 android phones and saturate

2204
02:13:57,901 --> 02:14:02,370
the rest of the world. Um, and give them
that experience and it was such passion.

2205
02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:04,920
I say that with passion,
right? The rest of the world.

2206
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:10,670
But 5 billion people having international
banking for the first time in history

2207
02:14:11,530 --> 02:14:14,250
I in that gives me shivers a it is,
it is.

2208
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:17,250
That is the most revolutionary
aspect of this technology.

2209
02:14:17,251 --> 02:14:21,960
It's not making like right now,
instead of swiping my card,

2210
02:14:22,290 --> 02:14:23,910
I can wave my phone.

2211
02:14:24,270 --> 02:14:29,040
I've saved 150 calories in my
consumer spending experience.

2212
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:31,620
That's bullshit.
That doesn't do anything for anyone.

2213
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:35,670
But you allow someone who's never
done banking before to send money

2214
02:14:35,671 --> 02:14:39,060
internationally to get loans from anywhere
in the world to start a company and

2215
02:14:39,061 --> 02:14:43,830
sell a product anywhere in the world.
And to do that for 4 billion people,

2216
02:14:44,070 --> 02:14:48,690
5 billion people, 6 billion people,
that stuff changes the world.

2217
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:51,660
It's not going to be
about shopping. No, no.

2218
02:14:51,661 --> 02:14:56,661
It's going to be about getting rid of
the existing sis system that many people

2219
02:14:57,331 --> 02:15:01,620
find, but they don't have an existing
system. Pressive but I mean in, in this,

2220
02:15:01,730 --> 02:15:04,620
you know, and in the third world
you're talking about in the,

2221
02:15:04,621 --> 02:15:07,620
in the second and third wall, so
this, according to the World Bank,

2222
02:15:07,621 --> 02:15:10,230
there's two and a half billion
people who are unbanked.

2223
02:15:10,231 --> 02:15:13,790
That means they have no banking
facilities whatsoever. No money.

2224
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:17,940
They can't deposit stones. No,
not true. They live in a cash.

2225
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:21,990
They live in cash and barter based
societies. They do have money.

2226
02:15:21,991 --> 02:15:26,850
They exchange labor products and services
with each other all the time. Eggs,

2227
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:31,260
chickens, beans, farming, carrying
water, whatever it may be,

2228
02:15:31,290 --> 02:15:35,310
post apocalyptic type money and they
have an enormous productive potential.

2229
02:15:35,580 --> 02:15:39,360
But barter makes it very difficult
to trade. Barter. If you,

2230
02:15:39,361 --> 02:15:43,380
if the other person wants chickens
and you have a goat, yeah,

2231
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:45,150
you got to give a lot of fucking chicken.

2232
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:47,070
You've got to find
someone who wants a goat.

2233
02:15:47,190 --> 02:15:51,810
And so and so what that does is that you
have a very high friction economy and

2234
02:15:51,811 --> 02:15:54,480
it reduces everybody's
productivity to do anything.

2235
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:58,110
You have to walk 10 20 miles to transact.

2236
02:15:58,470 --> 02:16:02,910
Now these people have productive capacity
and that's the two and a half billion.

2237
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:07,860
Then there's another three and a
half billion people who have banking,

2238
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:12,780
but it's very basic banking, which means
it's uh, in their own currency only.

2239
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:17,040
No international markets, no credits,
all liquidity, no credit history,

2240
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,440
no ability to wire money.
And their,

2241
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:23,070
their nearest bank branch
is usually fairly far away.

2242
02:16:23,071 --> 02:16:27,300
So they primarily use it for savings.
They don't use it to do, you know,

2243
02:16:27,301 --> 02:16:30,700
point of sale, visa swiping,
debit cards and things like that.

2244
02:16:32,350 --> 02:16:35,890
And together these two constituencies,

2245
02:16:35,891 --> 02:16:40,810
these two populations, many of them have
cell phones, they have text messaging,

2246
02:16:40,811 --> 02:16:41,560
cell phones.

2247
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:46,560
So you bring together those
two technologies and you
can create essentially a

2248
02:16:46,841 --> 02:16:49,570
revolution and financial,
um,

2249
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:54,750
economic inclusion in international trade
and productivity where instead of now

2250
02:16:55,691 --> 02:17:00,130
walking 15 miles the market, you can
do a transaction on your cell phone.

2251
02:17:00,290 --> 02:17:03,470
Well, especially since all that money
is interchangeable international.

2252
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:05,990
Yes, it's all, yes, it's all the same.

2253
02:17:06,050 --> 02:17:10,440
This happened in Kenya and Kenya
in 2001 at local phone companies,

2254
02:17:10,441 --> 02:17:11,120
safari calm,

2255
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:15,710
one of the telcos in that space created
a program where people could exchange

2256
02:17:15,711 --> 02:17:18,960
cell phone minutes with
each other. And so, um,

2257
02:17:19,010 --> 02:17:23,300
that system initially started
being used informally as money.

2258
02:17:23,330 --> 02:17:26,360
So people would be like, give me eggs,
I'll give you two cell phone minutes.

2259
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:28,100
Because it was equivalent to money.

2260
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:30,770
People couldn't afford
to have a bank account,

2261
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:32,900
but they could afford to
have a cell phone contract.

2262
02:17:32,901 --> 02:17:36,410
This is how messed up the banking
system is. It around the world.

2263
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:40,760
And so they would exchange
minutes for products and services.

2264
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:44,400
Eventually the phone company a couple
of years later recognize that they call

2265
02:17:44,401 --> 02:17:46,520
this thing empaysah for mobile peso,

2266
02:17:46,550 --> 02:17:50,240
which is the currency of Kenya
and they started broadening it to,

2267
02:17:50,330 --> 02:17:52,910
it now spends three or four
countries in the region.

2268
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:58,600
Here's what happened 11 years later and
Pesa is 40% of the GDP of Kenya for 0%

2269
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:06,340
40 and this is not GDP that got
converted from Paysa to Empaysah.

2270
02:18:07,490 --> 02:18:12,490
Most of this is completely new economic
activity that previously existed does

2271
02:18:12,681 --> 02:18:14,660
gray markets,
barter markets,

2272
02:18:14,661 --> 02:18:19,310
cash only societies and was inefficient
and slow so it actually generated growth

2273
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:23,180
and economic activity in this country.
We've seen this happen in one country.

2274
02:18:23,390 --> 02:18:25,460
You can't transfer and
pace outside the country.

2275
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:30,700
You can't use it for a mitten says it's
specific to one currency and it's still

2276
02:18:30,771 --> 02:18:34,370
heavily taxed and manipulated.
Now imagine what we could do with bitcoin.

2277
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:38,930
No, a few months back there
was some controversy online
and you made a statement

2278
02:18:38,931 --> 02:18:43,240
that you were resigning from
some sort of organization. Yeah.

2279
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:44,480
What was that all about?

2280
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:46,111
Well,
there's,

2281
02:18:46,111 --> 02:18:49,560
there's an organization which is kind
of like a membership association called

2282
02:18:49,561 --> 02:18:52,860
the Bitcoin Foundation and it sounds so,

2283
02:18:52,861 --> 02:18:56,880
a lot of people that this organization
has some kind of role or authority.

2284
02:18:56,881 --> 02:19:00,370
They really don't. It's just a
member association. Right. Um,

2285
02:19:00,690 --> 02:19:05,430
they don't control bitcoin. They don't
have any role to play in the code.

2286
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:10,950
Uh, they do collect money from members
and they use that money to pay some of the

2287
02:19:10,951 --> 02:19:14,880
main developers so that they can focus
full time on bitcoin. Like a foundation,

2288
02:19:14,910 --> 02:19:18,810
for example, a Mozilla that makes
Firefox, they have foundation,

2289
02:19:18,811 --> 02:19:22,500
they pay a lot of developers. Linux,
the operating system has a foundation,

2290
02:19:22,501 --> 02:19:27,500
pays a lot of developers. So
it's kind of like that. Um,

2291
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:30,050
but they don't have any
control over anything.

2292
02:19:30,051 --> 02:19:32,150
They just collect member Jews
and they do some law being,

2293
02:19:32,151 --> 02:19:34,340
they do some public relations,
they pay some developers.

2294
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:39,350
I had some problems with the transparency
and the way the organization was being

2295
02:19:39,351 --> 02:19:40,880
run.
I,

2296
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:45,980
I participated in the early days
in the election process. Uh,

2297
02:19:45,981 --> 02:19:46,970
I helped with that.

2298
02:19:46,971 --> 02:19:50,630
I was one of the people moderating
the debates between Ferris candidates,

2299
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:53,250
was hoping to see some reform,

2300
02:19:53,251 --> 02:19:57,470
some of the original members and some
of the charter and the rules were such

2301
02:19:57,471 --> 02:20:02,420
that it was highly, highly compromised
from the beginning. And for example,

2302
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:06,830
uh, one of the founding members
is mark was Mark Carr Palace,

2303
02:20:06,831 --> 02:20:09,680
the guy who owns and crashed Mt.
Gox.

2304
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:14,930
He was one of the founders and the
bigger the big fat face, right?

2305
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:20,140
So when you have like two or three of
the directors in that facing massive

2306
02:20:20,511 --> 02:20:23,630
lawsuits were indictments or still alive,

2307
02:20:25,070 --> 02:20:30,070
it seems like some didn't like a lot of
money vanished with hundreds of billions

2308
02:20:30,830 --> 02:20:34,970
of dollars and he's like running around
buying noodles at a market. Right.

2309
02:20:34,971 --> 02:20:38,450
He can go anywhere he wants. I'll put
that down to the fact that Japan has very,

2310
02:20:38,451 --> 02:20:43,000
very effective gun control. Oh, does
that, the reason why I, you know,

2311
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:46,290
I mean I'm a pacifist side.
I would like to thank the,

2312
02:20:46,291 --> 02:20:50,300
what should happen to him is we should
have a full and proper accounting of what

2313
02:20:50,301 --> 02:20:54,230
happens and then he should
pay the appropriate price
through the judicial system.

2314
02:20:54,260 --> 02:20:56,990
Well that's impossible though. I mean,
the amount of money that you would have,

2315
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,870
I mean he would have to generate
some ungodly, never. No,

2316
02:20:59,871 --> 02:21:02,540
people are never going to get
paid back for the money they lost.

2317
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:06,910
But at least you could see at
first truth then just form,

2318
02:21:06,911 --> 02:21:10,430
you need the truth first. Like let's at
least find out what actually happened.

2319
02:21:10,431 --> 02:21:14,180
People need to know that somehow or
another for folks who don't understand the

2320
02:21:14,181 --> 02:21:17,930
situation or are not aware
of it. Mt. Gox was about,

2321
02:21:18,580 --> 02:21:23,390
so it was an exchange. It would buy and
sell bitcoins for us. Dollar is cheap,

2322
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:26,420
Japanese yen and euros.
And it was the first exchange.

2323
02:21:26,421 --> 02:21:29,780
So it was the first place where you could
trade your bitcoins for something else.

2324
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:34,760
But it was originally, it was established
from a website that was about magic,

2325
02:21:34,761 --> 02:21:36,920
the gathering, right?
Correct. It was for trading,

2326
02:21:36,921 --> 02:21:39,770
playing cards because they ha they
already had the market based trading

2327
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:44,240
mechanism, so they just converted it to
Bitcoin, which was a very smart move,

2328
02:21:44,241 --> 02:21:49,040
but it wasn't up to the, to the
job. Um, what is it a scenario,

2329
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:50,150
sorry to interrupt you,
but it was,

2330
02:21:50,151 --> 02:21:54,140
it was a scenario where the landscape
had changed so quickly. Yes. So,

2331
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:58,670
so radically that they couldn't keep up
and they couldn't possibly have foreseen

2332
02:21:58,671 --> 02:22:02,300
it when they started trading trading
bitcoin and then it just got out of hand,

2333
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:03,920
uh, among other things. Yes.

2334
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:07,490
So how responsible would a person
be in that sort of scenario? Well,

2335
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:09,230
there's more than gross
incompetence there.

2336
02:22:09,231 --> 02:22:13,370
And I for a long time thought it was
just an incredible amount of incompetence

2337
02:22:13,371 --> 02:22:17,450
and lack of due diligence. Oh, so
now there's, there's evidence. Well,

2338
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:19,310
there's the classic evidence where,

2339
02:22:19,311 --> 02:22:24,311
and mistaken certain problems caused money
to be lost and then instead of coming

2340
02:22:24,471 --> 02:22:25,650
clean about that,

2341
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:31,100
but we know now knows that car Pellis
continued to run the operation where he

2342
02:22:31,201 --> 02:22:35,370
would pain old customers out from the
money coming in from new customers.

2343
02:22:35,371 --> 02:22:37,170
That's the definition of a Ponzi scheme.

2344
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:40,470
And most Ponzi schemes don't
start because someone says,

2345
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:41,700
let me run a Ponzi scheme.

2346
02:22:41,701 --> 02:22:44,340
They start because they start
trading customer's money,

2347
02:22:44,610 --> 02:22:48,030
they lose too much and they don't want
to admit that they lost the money,

2348
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:51,780
so they start using the new customer's
money to pay off the old customers.

2349
02:22:51,960 --> 02:22:53,100
The lies get bigger,

2350
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:57,270
the numbers get bigger until one day
the lies and the numbers get too big to

2351
02:22:57,271 --> 02:23:01,260
hide at all comes out in the open and
collapses. That's exactly what happened.

2352
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:05,940
The lesson to learn from Mt Gox is when
you have a decentralized secure solution

2353
02:23:05,941 --> 02:23:09,150
like bitcoin and you give all
of the keys to one person,

2354
02:23:10,050 --> 02:23:13,980
what happens is exactly what has happened
for the last several thousand years of

2355
02:23:13,981 --> 02:23:16,230
history.
That person takes the money in rugs.

2356
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:16,531
Yeah.

2357
02:23:16,531 --> 02:23:20,340
You've said on the podcast previously
that you think it's probably a good thing

2358
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:24,810
that this crashed and it's a good lesson
for the rest of the bitcoin community.

2359
02:23:24,850 --> 02:23:28,750
It's a very painful lesson. I wish
people had been able to learn it. I mean,

2360
02:23:29,350 --> 02:23:32,650
a lot of people were blowing the whistle
long before a collapse and saying,

2361
02:23:32,651 --> 02:23:35,410
including myself saying,
do not put your money in this system.

2362
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:40,060
And in many ways highlights the positive
attributes at bitcoin shared peer to

2363
02:23:40,061 --> 02:23:41,700
peer,
the way it's being done right now.

2364
02:23:41,870 --> 02:23:43,520
Awesome. So you know, the expression,

2365
02:23:43,521 --> 02:23:46,190
possession is nine tenths
of the law in Bitcoin.

2366
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:49,370
Possession is 10 tenths of the law.
If you have the keys, it's your money.

2367
02:23:49,371 --> 02:23:51,350
If you don't have the keys,
it's not your money.

2368
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:55,310
And people did not control the keys.
It's Gox.

2369
02:23:55,311 --> 02:23:58,400
They gave them to cart palace anyway,
so people get assessed.

2370
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:02,360
Just to wrap this up, I
resigned from that, uh,

2371
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:07,280
association saying I wanted to,
I tried to make it,

2372
02:24:07,460 --> 02:24:09,650
you know,
I don't want to make a big deal out of it.

2373
02:24:09,651 --> 02:24:11,860
I just say I disagree with the
way this is being managed. Then.

2374
02:24:11,861 --> 02:24:15,080
I like the transparency. It hasn't
been reformed enough. I'm out.

2375
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:18,310
It was turned into a very big news story.
Um,

2376
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:21,590
I'm hoping that nothing bad
happens within the foundation,

2377
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:25,310
but I still have concerns that
because of a lack of transparency,

2378
02:24:25,610 --> 02:24:30,170
because of a lack of reform that could
be opportunities there for shenanigans.

2379
02:24:30,290 --> 02:24:33,960
When is the best resource besides
listening to you on podcasts,

2380
02:24:33,961 --> 02:24:38,961
which is excellent for people to research
bitcoin to find out where they could

2381
02:24:40,220 --> 02:24:44,180
get more information, where they given,
assimilate into maybe a community,

2382
02:24:44,181 --> 02:24:46,790
a message board where
they can exchange ideas.

2383
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:51,720
So there's, there's a couple of really
good, uh, sites where you can go on CE.

2384
02:24:51,790 --> 02:24:56,760
Uh, Lauren thinks about bitcoin.
bitcoin.org is one of those,

2385
02:24:57,090 --> 02:25:01,410
uh, it has information about how to get
into bitcoin. What it is that's run a,

2386
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:04,980
again by an Association of users
is a nonprofit style thing.

2387
02:25:04,981 --> 02:25:07,980
It's one of the things that bitcoin
foundation does relatively well,

2388
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:11,490
and you can find information
about bitcoin there. Um,

2389
02:25:11,550 --> 02:25:16,440
there's various online communities and
massive community on Facebook. I'm really,

2390
02:25:16,441 --> 02:25:21,000
really, I'm very excited about
the meetup community meetup.com,

2391
02:25:21,390 --> 02:25:26,290
uh, local grassroots, uh, meetups all
around the world. So when I go speaking,

2392
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:30,730
like I went to Australia, I went to
the Sydney meetup group and I said,

2393
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:34,870
tell all your members, let's have a
meetup. I'll come talk about bitcoin.

2394
02:25:34,990 --> 02:25:39,460
And they gathered, they sold out
250 seats in a room like instantly.

2395
02:25:39,670 --> 02:25:41,350
So these things didn't exist a year ago.

2396
02:25:41,350 --> 02:25:45,280
The wall where there weren't enough
bitcoin in one place to get together.

2397
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:48,580
Now there are in hundreds
of places around the world.

2398
02:25:48,581 --> 02:25:53,581
So meetup.com go and meet people who
are into bitcoin and learn about it.

2399
02:25:53,591 --> 02:25:56,980
They're also meetups for bitcoin
developers to learn how to do software

2400
02:25:56,981 --> 02:26:01,820
development. And I started one of those
in San Francisco with the second, uh,

2401
02:26:01,830 --> 02:26:05,560
of that type and one of
the most successful and now
has more than 600 members I

2402
02:26:05,561 --> 02:26:10,150
believe. And I'm going to do a very
brief but shameless plug. How dare you?

2403
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:13,420
Um,
on December 27th or Riley media,

2404
02:26:13,421 --> 02:26:16,810
which is a software and
development publisher,

2405
02:26:16,811 --> 02:26:20,680
technical publisher is publishing my book.
It's called mastering bit coin.

2406
02:26:21,010 --> 02:26:24,480
And it's a book for software
developers to learn how to use bitcoin.

2407
02:26:24,490 --> 02:26:27,130
I spent a year and a half working
on that and just finished.

2408
02:26:27,131 --> 02:26:29,980
I got an email this morning
that final copy went to print,

2409
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:34,150
so I'm actually going to be a
book book or it's a book as well.

2410
02:26:34,390 --> 02:26:38,650
It's a digital book. It's a
print book cover. I, I'm, I'm,

2411
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:40,600
I should be a,

2412
02:26:40,601 --> 02:26:45,601
I'm trying to get Morgan
Freeman to read the [inaudible].

2413
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:50,470
I'll read it with my weird Greek British
accents. You're going to read it, right?

2414
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:53,290
I don't know. I don't know if this
is going to be an audio. It's,

2415
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:56,100
it's a technical book.
It's got cold segments in it.

2416
02:26:56,470 --> 02:26:59,290
It's not exactly geared to
be an audio book, but, okay.

2417
02:26:59,291 --> 02:27:03,910
We'll see ebook print. Um, it's
also on an open source license.

2418
02:27:03,911 --> 02:27:07,690
I'm a huge believer in open source. I use
the creative Commons licensing system,

2419
02:27:07,691 --> 02:27:11,680
so it's creative Commons with attribution
share, like it's available online.

2420
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:15,820
The entire book was developed online with
contributions from hundreds of people

2421
02:27:15,821 --> 02:27:20,290
who corrected things in the book.
All of the editing process was public.

2422
02:27:20,530 --> 02:27:24,580
You can download it for free.
It's for free or is there, no,

2423
02:27:24,581 --> 02:27:28,690
it's published by a mainstream software
and technical publisher with a lot of

2424
02:27:28,691 --> 02:27:32,420
clout who are taking it to a mainstream
audience because we needed that to this

2425
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:36,460
space and that's coming out in
print, Amazon, Barnes and noble,

2426
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:40,990
[inaudible] Dot Com and every other
book publisher and book distributor out

2427
02:27:40,991 --> 02:27:43,090
there. We'll have a copy of
this book. You can buy it.

2428
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:46,720
It's 30 to 35 bucks retail,

2429
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:51,780
approximately 28 I think on Amazon you
can buy an Ebook for about $25 and but

2430
02:27:54,641 --> 02:27:59,140
it's also available for free online
as a pdf or as that source code.

2431
02:27:59,190 --> 02:28:00,770
Kind of crazy.
You're,

2432
02:28:00,771 --> 02:28:03,580
you're selling it and you're giving
it away at the same time. Yes,

2433
02:28:03,610 --> 02:28:07,930
and I will tell you that has many
have discovered in this space.

2434
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:13,390
Open source content does
not diminish retail sales.

2435
02:28:13,391 --> 02:28:16,750
In fact, it grows them. Really? Yes.

2436
02:28:16,780 --> 02:28:18,700
The people who can't
afford to buy the book,

2437
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:22,520
we'll buy it to put it on their bookshelf
and have paper reference to put it on

2438
02:28:22,521 --> 02:28:26,630
their kindle than a nicely
formatted convenient way.
It's easy. It's convenient.

2439
02:28:26,631 --> 02:28:28,370
One Click.
If there is value,

2440
02:28:28,371 --> 02:28:32,090
people will pay for
convenience and packaging and,

2441
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:36,740
and just kind of the quality of,
of printed colored paper.

2442
02:28:36,980 --> 02:28:38,820
Honestly, they will. Um,

2443
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:42,740
that's why you're drinking a bottle of
water when you can get free water from

2444
02:28:42,741 --> 02:28:46,030
the tap because the government
fluoride in black helicopters,

2445
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:50,090
but people pay for quality
and packaging and convenience.

2446
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:54,320
And so at the same time, people who
couldn't afford to buy the book,

2447
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:59,930
uh, we'll download it and use it as
a resource to learn these skills.

2448
02:28:59,931 --> 02:29:02,870
And to me that's the most important
thing because if you want to invest in

2449
02:29:02,871 --> 02:29:06,110
Bitcoin is you don't invest in the
currency. You invest in the skills.

2450
02:29:06,230 --> 02:29:10,520
This is like learning how
to make a website in 2000
is like learning how to make

2451
02:29:10,521 --> 02:29:15,480
an Ios app in 2005. This is a
skill that will give you a job and,

2452
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:19,250
and so that's killed. It'll give you
a job. Yeah. Like what kind of job?

2453
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:23,630
We're hiring thousands of people in this
industry in order to do the software

2454
02:29:23,631 --> 02:29:24,464
development.

2455
02:29:24,650 --> 02:29:28,120
What kind of software development and
we're talking about there are now, um,

2456
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:32,230
some 800 startups being tracked by,
um,

2457
02:29:32,330 --> 02:29:33,680
I think it's called venture scan,

2458
02:29:33,681 --> 02:29:37,730
which is a company that tracks funded
venture capital funded startups.

2459
02:29:37,970 --> 02:29:41,810
There are more than 800 companies in
the space doing startups around Bitcoin,

2460
02:29:41,811 --> 02:29:46,730
building applications, user interfaces,
new financial services, exchanges,

2461
02:29:46,731 --> 02:29:49,790
wallets, you name it,
someone's building something.

2462
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:54,820
This is a new industry blossoming
and creating thousands of jobs.

2463
02:29:55,310 --> 02:29:55,760
And,

2464
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:00,760
and this industry is now hiring thousands
of people in the u s especially with

2465
02:30:01,281 --> 02:30:05,720
skills around software development,
accounting, finance, um,

2466
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:10,770
marketing, public relations,
operations management,

2467
02:30:10,970 --> 02:30:15,560
the entire spectrum of things
you need in a startup. Wow.

2468
02:30:15,650 --> 02:30:20,570
And so this book that you wrote has a lot
of coding and coding instruction in it.

2469
02:30:20,660 --> 02:30:24,990
So the first two chapters
are accessible to anyone. Um,

2470
02:30:25,640 --> 02:30:30,110
they explain how bitcoin works at
a level that someone who is not,

2471
02:30:30,111 --> 02:30:34,100
who is a bit technical but not a program.
I can understand.

2472
02:30:34,250 --> 02:30:39,250
The other eight chapters are how bitcoin
works in detail for a programmer to get

2473
02:30:40,820 --> 02:30:44,600
a complete soup to nuts overview
of how the entire system,

2474
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:46,010
not just bitcoin,

2475
02:30:46,011 --> 02:30:49,160
but the blockchain technology and all of
the other currencies that are based on

2476
02:30:49,161 --> 02:30:52,100
that model, how it works,
how to write software to it,

2477
02:30:52,101 --> 02:30:55,100
how all the data structures work,
how have the protocols work,

2478
02:30:55,580 --> 02:30:59,260
and to get a complete
understanding of it. Uh, so,

2479
02:30:59,330 --> 02:31:01,880
so it's really for programmers.
So you,

2480
02:31:01,881 --> 02:31:06,180
and you've immersed yourself in this
over the period of x amount of years.

2481
02:31:06,181 --> 02:31:08,650
How many years? Three years.
Three years. And what,

2482
02:31:08,660 --> 02:31:12,740
what knowledge base of coding did
you have before you got into it?

2483
02:31:13,250 --> 02:31:17,660
I started coding when I was 10 years old,
so I'm not a professional programmer.

2484
02:31:17,740 --> 02:31:22,330
I'm, I'm, I'm passionate
amateur if you like. I,

2485
02:31:22,470 --> 02:31:24,510
I've been paid a few
times for writing code,

2486
02:31:24,511 --> 02:31:29,460
but I'm not as productive and disciplined
as a professional coder who only does

2487
02:31:29,461 --> 02:31:32,280
coding. Um, I code for fun.

2488
02:31:32,710 --> 02:31:37,110
I code because I'm fascinated by it.
And when I started this,

2489
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:40,330
I knew quite a lot about coding,
um,

2490
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:45,300
and a bit about bitcoin. And I
started writing a book, honestly,

2491
02:31:46,110 --> 02:31:49,320
the best way to teach yourself at
technologies to try to teach it to someone

2492
02:31:49,321 --> 02:31:54,290
else. And I learned more about Bitcoin
by writing the book. And you know,

2493
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:55,740
when I started,
I knew a bit.

2494
02:31:56,130 --> 02:32:01,130
Now I know a lot more because I had to
find ways to explain this technology in

2495
02:32:01,651 --> 02:32:02,484
simple terms.

2496
02:32:02,490 --> 02:32:02,730
You know,

2497
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:06,870
that's so fascinating that you say that
because that's a truism that is a often

2498
02:32:06,871 --> 02:32:09,300
expressed in martial arts.
You know,

2499
02:32:09,390 --> 02:32:13,950
one of the ways that I got really good
at martial arts is I taught from the time

2500
02:32:13,951 --> 02:32:17,940
I was 15 years old, I taught,
I taught at Boston University,

2501
02:32:17,941 --> 02:32:19,650
I taught at my own school.
I was,

2502
02:32:19,950 --> 02:32:23,340
I used to teach all of the private
lessons at mines. And because of that,

2503
02:32:23,341 --> 02:32:28,140
my technique got very clean and
sharp. Right. And I, I think that,

2504
02:32:28,141 --> 02:32:31,230
that I've often thought about doing
that with, even with standup comedy,

2505
02:32:31,231 --> 02:32:34,230
although I don't think you
really can teach standup comedy,

2506
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:38,880
you can kind of exchange
information and go over the, the,

2507
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:43,410
the facts of it or the, the, the,
the, the building blocks of it.

2508
02:32:43,740 --> 02:32:46,740
So I find that really amazing that
you say that about coding as well.

2509
02:32:47,100 --> 02:32:50,810
It seems to be chipped Prov
right? Um, not really. Well,

2510
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:55,350
you can teach these people to never do it
again. Okay. I fucking, I needed a genre.

2511
02:32:55,370 --> 02:33:00,090
Well, I would sign up. Um,
yeah, it applies to coding.

2512
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:04,260
It applies to book writing. Applies
to, this applies to public speaking.

2513
02:33:04,710 --> 02:33:08,850
I'm learning how to be a pilot
now. Um, so I love flying planes.

2514
02:33:08,851 --> 02:33:13,740
So it's one of the things I'm really
into and as soon as I'm complete with my

2515
02:33:13,741 --> 02:33:15,810
training,
it should be in the next month or so,

2516
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:20,340
I'm going to start the next stage to
become an instructor because if I want to

2517
02:33:20,341 --> 02:33:23,850
get really good at that, I need to start
teaching other people how to do it.

2518
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:28,530
It's a truism cross. If you want
to learn something, well teach it.

2519
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:32,730
And maybe at first it's
hard because you in,

2520
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:34,530
in teaching it,
you realize how,

2521
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:37,900
how much you need to learn in
order to be more crisp and to,

2522
02:33:38,490 --> 02:33:42,210
to be able to create explanations
that are simple to understand.

2523
02:33:42,510 --> 02:33:45,920
You first have to understand
it in depth yourself. Yes.

2524
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:48,300
But it focuses you and so that's,

2525
02:33:48,330 --> 02:33:52,650
that was part of how I wrote
the book was I, I understood it,

2526
02:33:52,651 --> 02:33:57,480
but I understood it at a relatively
superficial level just to use it in trying

2527
02:33:57,481 --> 02:34:01,490
to explain it, I had to learn. It's
a lot deeper. That's, that is so

2528
02:34:01,550 --> 02:34:06,550
true and so interesting about knowledge
about information is that a lot of

2529
02:34:06,681 --> 02:34:10,100
people develop a cursory or a
working knowledge of something.

2530
02:34:10,370 --> 02:34:14,030
But in order to really explain it,
you have to have a full foundation.

2531
02:34:14,031 --> 02:34:18,190
You have to have, you know, every,
you have to have the, the blocks,

2532
02:34:18,191 --> 02:34:19,090
the structure,

2533
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:22,930
you have to have the whole thing in order
to explain what a house is, you know,

2534
02:34:22,931 --> 02:34:26,560
and then that's, that's a, that's a
really amazing thing about information.

2535
02:34:27,790 --> 02:34:28,271
It just,

2536
02:34:28,271 --> 02:34:33,271
it really fascinates me how the mind
works and how just absorbing information

2537
02:34:35,861 --> 02:34:39,930
and the depth of bap absorption. Like
there's some people that I could talk to,

2538
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:44,500
I'm sure that no bitcoin but don't know
bit coin like you and I could have a

2539
02:34:44,501 --> 02:34:47,860
conversation with them and come away
with some misconceptions. Perhaps,

2540
02:34:48,130 --> 02:34:49,960
but then talking and talking to you,

2541
02:34:49,961 --> 02:34:53,080
especially since you teach it so much
and me and essentially what you're doing

2542
02:34:53,081 --> 02:34:55,540
when you do podcasts is
you're teaching us what,

2543
02:34:55,600 --> 02:35:00,520
what the potential or the future
applications for Bitcoin can be.

2544
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:02,050
And in doing so,
you know,

2545
02:35:02,051 --> 02:35:05,860
I get a much deeper sense of what it is
because you're so used to teaching it.

2546
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:07,430
Yeah, and I, I have to say,

2547
02:35:07,431 --> 02:35:11,090
you've got to realize there was a lot
of people who know bit coin a hell of a

2548
02:35:11,091 --> 02:35:14,210
lot better than I do and know
how to apply it to the fuck.

2549
02:35:14,211 --> 02:35:17,260
Are these people well there,
there must be Weirdos. No,

2550
02:35:17,310 --> 02:35:22,040
they're all the technical geniuses who
spend most of the time making the bitcoin

2551
02:35:22,041 --> 02:35:24,410
code better and building
applications around it.

2552
02:35:25,160 --> 02:35:30,160
I'm not a professional coder and I
don't spend most of my time doing that.

2553
02:35:31,310 --> 02:35:33,780
It's important to realize what they do is,

2554
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:38,960
is orders of magnitude deeper than
what I do and understand about bitcoin.

2555
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:42,530
But I have one skills.
Yes, I have one skill.

2556
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:46,700
I think that skill is necessary
and valuable and this is what I do.

2557
02:35:46,701 --> 02:35:47,660
I took my skill,

2558
02:35:47,661 --> 02:35:52,661
which is explaining and teaching and
public speaking and applied it to bitcoin.

2559
02:35:53,870 --> 02:35:56,230
And I'm not the most knowledgeable.
I'm not,

2560
02:35:56,250 --> 02:35:59,780
not even close to being the
most knowledgeable. Bless.
And what are you missing?

2561
02:36:00,650 --> 02:36:05,140
What are you missing a lot of
blogs? Well, first of all, um,

2562
02:36:05,210 --> 02:36:10,130
the focus on on code and developing,
I mean, I don't write code,

2563
02:36:10,210 --> 02:36:13,670
you know, 24 hours a day. I
don't write code all the time.

2564
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:17,950
They write code all the
time. The Algorithms, um,

2565
02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:20,210
issues of scalability and optimization,

2566
02:36:20,211 --> 02:36:25,211
understanding the really subtle technical
nuances of the protocol and developing

2567
02:36:26,241 --> 02:36:29,900
a consensus protocol. Those
are really subtle. I mean,

2568
02:36:30,110 --> 02:36:34,220
you can find tiny,
tiny bugs in Bitcoin,

2569
02:36:34,490 --> 02:36:38,150
which under certain conditions,
if you're right to transaction,

2570
02:36:38,151 --> 02:36:42,440
was certain script operators that can
cause this to happen and that to happen.

2571
02:36:42,710 --> 02:36:46,460
And you've got people who are way out
ahead who are finding these things,

2572
02:36:46,461 --> 02:36:47,294
figuring out,
oh,

2573
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:52,280
here's some things that could go wrong
in a transaction and here's some code

2574
02:36:52,281 --> 02:36:56,540
that ensures that we check
for that from now on. I mean,

2575
02:36:56,570 --> 02:37:00,080
I don't have that depth. I can
understand what they're talking about.

2576
02:37:00,110 --> 02:37:03,440
But I wouldn't have figured that out by
myself because I don't spend the time

2577
02:37:03,441 --> 02:37:04,820
analyzing the code like they do.

2578
02:37:05,510 --> 02:37:08,210
It's one of the weird things about
being a human being. It's just,

2579
02:37:08,211 --> 02:37:13,211
it's so cool that there are
so many different people
and that the spectrum is so

2580
02:37:13,251 --> 02:37:16,010
broad that there are some just

2581
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:21,200
very bizarre people that are just sitting
in front of a computer just banging

2582
02:37:21,201 --> 02:37:26,201
out numbers since staring at lines of
code and those are super important.

2583
02:37:26,690 --> 02:37:29,420
If those people weren't here, we wouldn't
be doing this, wouldn't be doing this.

2584
02:37:29,421 --> 02:37:32,720
There's no question about it. The
online, can I do no online, right?

2585
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:36,050
What I do by comparison
is a is an afterthought.

2586
02:37:36,051 --> 02:37:39,980
It's a layer that only happens because
other people did this work at first.

2587
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:44,930
That's what what really amazes
me about working in this space.

2588
02:37:44,931 --> 02:37:49,760
Over the last three years, I have
met some of the sharpest, smartest,

2589
02:37:49,761 --> 02:37:50,930
most intelligent,

2590
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:55,960
most incredibly complicated
thinkers in terms of coding,

2591
02:37:56,031 --> 02:37:59,870
technology, databases,
protocols, finance, economics,

2592
02:37:59,871 --> 02:38:01,040
monetary policy.

2593
02:38:01,310 --> 02:38:06,310
Some of the best thinkers of
our generation have fixated
on this little project

2594
02:38:08,570 --> 02:38:12,050
and are doing things that are incredible,
and I meet these people and I say,

2595
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:16,550
there's a reason why when smart
people figure out what this is,

2596
02:38:16,670 --> 02:38:20,900
they get fixated. They get really,
really obsessed about this technology.

2597
02:38:20,901 --> 02:38:22,490
So you go from skeptic.

2598
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:26,720
My first reaction when I came
across bitcoin was nerd money,

2599
02:38:26,721 --> 02:38:30,830
like just completely ignored it.
Six months later, I read the paper,

2600
02:38:31,670 --> 02:38:33,860
light bulbs start going off
in my head. I'm like, Oh,

2601
02:38:33,861 --> 02:38:38,630
distributed control system security model.
This is not just the currency. Wait,

2602
02:38:38,631 --> 02:38:41,150
hang on a second.
This is contents.

2603
02:38:41,151 --> 02:38:44,780
Now it has these implications and you
just go straight down the rabbit hole.

2604
02:38:45,890 --> 02:38:47,840
I went down that rabbit hole so far.

2605
02:38:47,841 --> 02:38:52,841
Four months later I had lost more than
20 pounds because I was spending 18 hours

2606
02:38:53,721 --> 02:38:57,680
a day reading everything I could
about it. Writing Code, communicating.

2607
02:38:57,681 --> 02:39:02,120
I forgot to eat. This has happened
to me three or four times in my life.

2608
02:39:03,630 --> 02:39:07,460
That is a particular personality quirk.
I call it.

2609
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:11,540
I call it the state of Fugue fugue.

2610
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:14,390
Feg FEG you,
he,

2611
02:39:14,391 --> 02:39:19,190
it's this association with reality and
you can go all the way pathological and

2612
02:39:19,191 --> 02:39:21,850
just run into serious
trouble. Um, I did it.

2613
02:39:21,851 --> 02:39:24,710
It's on a relatively heavy
basis for most people,

2614
02:39:24,711 --> 02:39:29,240
but still survivable my first
computer when I got my first computer.

2615
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:33,860
It just, it's completely transformed
my life. It's, it's opened up,

2616
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:39,020
um, a space of imagination
that I didn't know existed.

2617
02:39:39,050 --> 02:39:42,530
And I started programming and I realize
what you could do with programming.

2618
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:47,720
And my mind is a 10 year old just went,
so what year was this?

2619
02:39:48,110 --> 02:39:52,010
This was a 1982.
So you got in way early.

2620
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:56,000
It was one of the first,
uh, like before the Atari,

2621
02:39:56,001 --> 02:39:58,250
like this was a ZX 81.

2622
02:39:58,260 --> 02:40:02,840
Sinclair microcomputer from Britain.
You connected it to your TV,

2623
02:40:02,841 --> 02:40:06,020
but you could program this thing and
you could write basic software and you

2624
02:40:06,021 --> 02:40:09,860
could even write to assembly code on it.
And within six months,

2625
02:40:09,980 --> 02:40:13,690
by the time I was 11, I was writing
assembly code on this thing and,

2626
02:40:13,800 --> 02:40:16,080
and I didn't even understand
the mathematics behind it.

2627
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,940
I learned those
mathematics in high school,

2628
02:40:17,941 --> 02:40:21,900
but I already was practicing that stuff.

2629
02:40:22,140 --> 02:40:27,140
When I got my first modem and I connected
to bulletin board systems and Los

2630
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:30,030
Angeles, in fact from Greece
over long distance phone calls.

2631
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:33,190
My family was not happy
about that phone bill. Um,

2632
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:36,840
and I communicated with geeks on
another continent for the first time.

2633
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:39,010
It blew my mind.
I,

2634
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:44,120
I opened the door to an entire reality
that was impossible for a Greek teen to,

2635
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:48,750
to experience. And when I got my
first Internet connection again,

2636
02:40:49,710 --> 02:40:52,920
bitcoin is would like one of those events.
And when I first started,

2637
02:40:52,921 --> 02:40:57,400
I dismissed it. But when I, when I took a
slightly deeper glimpse and I saw where,

2638
02:40:57,450 --> 02:41:02,160
what it was straight down the rabbit hole,
forgot to eat for four months,

2639
02:41:03,390 --> 02:41:07,800
lost a ton of weight, just became
completely obsessed completely.

2640
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,530
I mean,
you know,

2641
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:15,270
you go out for dinner with your friends
and you bring up bitcoin in every single

2642
02:41:15,271 --> 02:41:19,410
conversation and before long you're
not invited to dinner anymore.

2643
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:24,630
Um, but after that I managed
to find a more healthy balance.

2644
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:29,280
Um, I'm still absolutely
fascinated about this technology.

2645
02:41:29,281 --> 02:41:32,070
I don't forget to eat anymore.
I'm still fascinated by as technology.

2646
02:41:32,071 --> 02:41:37,071
And every day I learned something that
opens up even more the possibilities.

2647
02:41:38,380 --> 02:41:41,760
And, and now I'm not longer thinking,
well, can we do in two years?

2648
02:41:41,761 --> 02:41:46,710
And now I'm thinking this is still going
to be changing things two decades from

2649
02:41:46,711 --> 02:41:51,390
now, three decades from now. Wow.
Well listen dude, I was like,

2650
02:41:51,391 --> 02:41:52,350
you are very important,

2651
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:58,380
really crazy fucks that will not eat
for months at a time and lose 18 pounds

2652
02:41:59,230 --> 02:42:02,860
because you find the viability and
the potential in something like this,

2653
02:42:03,370 --> 02:42:04,270
it's very important.

2654
02:42:04,750 --> 02:42:08,590
The world didn't change because
someone who was already an established

2655
02:42:09,230 --> 02:42:13,270
researcher in an established space
made a tiny incremental change.

2656
02:42:13,690 --> 02:42:18,690
The world has changed numerous times
because someone from the lunatic fringe

2657
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:23,950
refuse to accept that their idea was
stupid and crazy and would never work and

2658
02:42:23,951 --> 02:42:28,510
persevered regardless and end
adopt changing an entire industry.

2659
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:33,670
When Einstein was a patent worker in the
Australian patent office or Swiss paths,

2660
02:42:33,671 --> 02:42:35,650
that office, I don't remember even, um,

2661
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:39,220
he wasn't part of the physics community.

2662
02:42:39,340 --> 02:42:44,140
He was the lunatic fringe. And he came
up with an idea that was ridiculed,

2663
02:42:44,820 --> 02:42:48,580
uh, for a good decade before
anybody figured out that
there was something there,

2664
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:52,480
right? Um, and we see the same
thing in history again and again.

2665
02:42:52,780 --> 02:42:56,650
We rewrite and whitewash the
history of innovation to say,

2666
02:42:56,950 --> 02:43:00,310
and then Ford created the
car and everyone went,

2667
02:43:00,640 --> 02:43:04,660
good job forward. We'll all
buy model t's. No, they didn't.

2668
02:43:04,661 --> 02:43:08,890
What they said was, you car
enthusiasts, you're insane.

2669
02:43:09,160 --> 02:43:13,300
This is crazy. It's, it's noisy.
It will destroy our roads.

2670
02:43:13,301 --> 02:43:14,290
It will never work.

2671
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:19,480
When Edison discovered and created all
of these wonderful things around the

2672
02:43:19,481 --> 02:43:22,300
electricity, people didn't
say, that's amazing.

2673
02:43:22,301 --> 02:43:24,910
Let's all electrify
everything the media said.

2674
02:43:25,060 --> 02:43:27,880
Anybody who puts electricity in
their house will burn it down.

2675
02:43:28,060 --> 02:43:32,560
And only the rich and crazy would dabble
in this technology and it will soon go

2676
02:43:32,561 --> 02:43:34,090
away and pass as a fad.

2677
02:43:34,330 --> 02:43:38,080
And why don't you use traditional
good working kerosene?

2678
02:43:39,730 --> 02:43:40,910
Well,
that's what he said about everything.

2679
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:44,680
If that's what they said about
everything, it takes the, it takes.

2680
02:43:44,681 --> 02:43:49,681
The people who refuse to accept
the vision they're seeing is crazy.

2681
02:43:50,230 --> 02:43:53,440
Now, Carl Sagan said something
very important. He says, yes,

2682
02:43:53,441 --> 02:43:56,770
they laughed at Christopher Columbus.
Yes, they laughed at Edison,

2683
02:43:57,400 --> 02:44:00,940
but they also laughed at Bozo the clown.
You have to,

2684
02:44:01,720 --> 02:44:03,860
you have to be fairly
confident that there's,

2685
02:44:03,900 --> 02:44:07,930
there's a there there because you
might end up just being bozo the clown,

2686
02:44:07,931 --> 02:44:12,160
in which case they're right to be laughing
at you. It's a matter of subtlety.

2687
02:44:12,220 --> 02:44:13,960
I think there's a there there and I'm,

2688
02:44:13,961 --> 02:44:18,961
every day I meet more
astonishingly intelligent
people who have fallen down the

2689
02:44:20,141 --> 02:44:24,070
same rabbit hole as me in exactly the
same way and have come out of the other

2690
02:44:24,071 --> 02:44:28,780
side transformed and have decided to
dedicate their life or part of their

2691
02:44:28,781 --> 02:44:31,990
career, or at least the focus,
their energy, their passion,

2692
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:37,020
their work to seeing how far we can take
this little experiment because we all

2693
02:44:38,351 --> 02:44:42,460
realize the simple equation underneath
it. Well, there could be nine wrong,

2694
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:49,330
I lose some money and some
of my time if I'm right,

2695
02:44:49,870 --> 02:44:53,830
we're going to change the world.
It's a simple as that,

2696
02:44:54,310 --> 02:44:57,820
and if I'm wrong, nobody gets
hurt. The people who got into this,

2697
02:44:58,120 --> 02:45:01,930
they understand the risks. This is
fringey stuff. This is out. There you go.

2698
02:45:01,931 --> 02:45:04,750
Invest all of your retirement
savings in Bitcoin, you're an idiot.

2699
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:07,780
You're going to lose a lot of money.
That's not how you do it,

2700
02:45:08,620 --> 02:45:10,360
but the people investing their blood,
sweat,

2701
02:45:10,361 --> 02:45:14,680
tears and knowledge and passion and
enthusiasm into this. If they lose,

2702
02:45:15,070 --> 02:45:18,610
they've had a fun ride. I'm
enjoying this, but if they're right,

2703
02:45:19,420 --> 02:45:20,253
we're changing the world.

2704
02:45:20,690 --> 02:45:24,620
Well, I don't the question of
whether or not there's a there there.

2705
02:45:24,680 --> 02:45:28,340
I don't think that's a valid question.
There's unquestionably there, there.

2706
02:45:28,760 --> 02:45:29,593
It's already there.

2707
02:45:29,610 --> 02:45:34,170
We can say that now. A year ago it was
really hard to even make that argument.

2708
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:37,290
Well, now you can say it. Now you
can say it. Now you've got paypal,

2709
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:40,110
Nike by Dell Computer.
If you can use bitcoin,

2710
02:45:40,290 --> 02:45:44,130
you send off and then you get a laptop
and then your online with this laptop.

2711
02:45:44,131 --> 02:45:47,940
You've got this laptop from bitcoin.
There's a there there, that's a there.

2712
02:45:48,010 --> 02:45:51,000
It doesn't matter how many
Phd's in economics, right?

2713
02:45:51,001 --> 02:45:55,150
Very long papers telling me it's not
money. If I get a laptop in the mail,

2714
02:45:55,390 --> 02:45:56,040
it's money.

2715
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:58,140
It's a there. Yeah, there's
no question about it.

2716
02:45:58,141 --> 02:46:03,141
If you use bitcoin to get an escort and
the escort soon as that website is up

2717
02:46:03,361 --> 02:46:07,290
and available right now,
it's not to me and refresh all day.

2718
02:46:07,510 --> 02:46:09,150
When that website comes online,

2719
02:46:09,370 --> 02:46:14,370
Brian will be one of your biggest
evangelists come on right now.

2720
02:46:14,451 --> 02:46:16,310
I'm sure you look at Brian
like, ah, this is crazy.

2721
02:46:16,311 --> 02:46:18,490
Fuck that Joe hangs out with you.

2722
02:46:18,491 --> 02:46:23,120
We'll have a new found respect for him
and his ability to spread the knowledge

2723
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:28,240
and power of Bitcoin once these escorts
sites go up because then things will

2724
02:46:28,791 --> 02:46:31,850
change. Like rub maps,
40% of all rub maps.

2725
02:46:31,851 --> 02:46:36,350
Customers go to rub maps because of
Brian because they found out about Brian.

2726
02:46:36,490 --> 02:46:39,760
I have a serious point to make about
that and I don't want to minimize what

2727
02:46:39,761 --> 02:46:44,350
you're saying. Please do. I
wouldn't, I would never imagine.

2728
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:45,753
Um,

2729
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:51,310
the ability to control your money
in a way that is entirely personal.

2730
02:46:51,370 --> 02:46:53,560
The fact that you can
memorize a bit coin address,

2731
02:46:53,561 --> 02:46:55,120
the fact that you can control that money.

2732
02:46:55,121 --> 02:46:59,980
The fact that no one can take it from
you in that industry is an incredibly

2733
02:46:59,981 --> 02:47:04,981
empowering process because it would
actually allow the women who are in that

2734
02:47:05,320 --> 02:47:10,320
industry to get the value of what
they're doing instead of being exploited

2735
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:14,230
mostly by men and mostly through violence.

2736
02:47:14,470 --> 02:47:19,470
So surprisingly enough you can make
a very strong argument that the,

2737
02:47:21,740 --> 02:47:26,740
the self determination and control
aspect of bitcoin has a very significant

2738
02:47:27,821 --> 02:47:29,620
empowering effect in that space.

2739
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:33,970
You can't get robbed at knife point from
money that's sitting on your wallets

2740
02:47:33,971 --> 02:47:38,050
with a pin number or that's being
transferred to an a service that you don't

2741
02:47:38,051 --> 02:47:41,500
have access to and your
pimp can't steal your money.

2742
02:47:41,620 --> 02:47:44,710
It's a very good point. It's a
very good point. And you know,

2743
02:47:45,700 --> 02:47:50,700
not getting deep down into the rabbit
hole of social norms and why laws exist in

2744
02:47:51,371 --> 02:47:55,420
the first place in what is and not
empowering to any person takes on any job.

2745
02:47:55,730 --> 02:47:59,530
And it's our societal constructs that
make it illegal in the first place.

2746
02:47:59,531 --> 02:48:01,360
Manage a woman should be able
to do whatever she wants,

2747
02:48:01,630 --> 02:48:06,370
including giving massages or kicking men
in the balls for money. I mean, there's,

2748
02:48:06,371 --> 02:48:08,440
there's women that do
that. I mean, there's a,

2749
02:48:08,441 --> 02:48:12,100
there's a valid fucking job
to that. There's, there's a,

2750
02:48:12,101 --> 02:48:16,780
an occupation trick. They, there's,
there's not just one of them. I mean,

2751
02:48:16,781 --> 02:48:20,350
there's thousands of them all across
the country. Maybe even more than that.

2752
02:48:20,351 --> 02:48:22,930
I mean, I don't know how many dominatrix
there are, but I've met a bunch of them.

2753
02:48:23,220 --> 02:48:25,070
Well, you'll like this story. Um,

2754
02:48:25,170 --> 02:48:29,130
the idea of money is not an idea
that just exists in humans. In fact,

2755
02:48:29,460 --> 02:48:33,810
money exists in every culture
and is created by every culture,

2756
02:48:33,900 --> 02:48:35,310
even by children.

2757
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:39,060
Toddlers creates money spontaneously as
a cultural expression when they don't

2758
02:48:39,061 --> 02:48:39,841
know what money is.

2759
02:48:39,841 --> 02:48:44,190
They'll trade rubber bands and wooden
blocks and things like that. But in fact,

2760
02:48:44,191 --> 02:48:48,390
it's an idea that even goes beyond humans.
You can teach primates what money is.

2761
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:53,040
You can teach them the idea that abstract
token can be exchanged for value. So,

2762
02:48:53,041 --> 02:48:55,510
for example, they've done
studies where they teach, she's

2763
02:48:55,530 --> 02:49:00,160
in my act 2009 talking monkey's in space
had a whole bit about chimps. Shannon's,

2764
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:02,020
they'd touch chimps,
manned orangutans.

2765
02:49:02,021 --> 02:49:04,080
The first thing they did
is they emailed Trump.

2766
02:49:04,110 --> 02:49:08,190
Chimps took the mail chimp's
money and fucked him. Right? So

2767
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:10,950
is that two most traded?
Well,

2768
02:49:10,951 --> 02:49:14,610
I would say the three most traded
commodities in the world, our food,

2769
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:17,220
sex and recreational narcotics,

2770
02:49:17,221 --> 02:49:20,370
they have been the three most traded
commodities in the world since the

2771
02:49:20,371 --> 02:49:21,300
beginning of time.

2772
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:26,280
The accusation is that Bitcoin is used
to buy drugs or by sex is a ridiculous

2773
02:49:26,281 --> 02:49:30,150
accusation on its face. If it
couldn't be used to buy those things,

2774
02:49:30,210 --> 02:49:32,480
arguably it's not money because,

2775
02:49:32,720 --> 02:49:36,450
and the thing that cannot be used to
buy the three most traded commodities in

2776
02:49:36,451 --> 02:49:37,350
the world is not money.

2777
02:49:37,620 --> 02:49:42,180
The point is that money represents the
buying habits of the population using it.

2778
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:45,510
If you wanted to see
mainstream values in Bitcoin,

2779
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:49,570
wait until bitcoin becomes mainstream and
then you will see mainstream values in

2780
02:49:49,571 --> 02:49:52,500
bitcoin. It's as simple as that, you know?

2781
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:56,670
Well, it's about personal freedom
when it comes to any form of pleasure.

2782
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:57,720
When people enjoy,

2783
02:49:57,721 --> 02:50:01,230
whether it's the pleasure of having
someone cook your meal for you,

2784
02:50:01,650 --> 02:50:04,710
the pleasure of having someone
give you a back rub. I mean,

2785
02:50:04,810 --> 02:50:09,720
all those things are legal because
it's a, it's a skill. These are,

2786
02:50:09,721 --> 02:50:12,930
these are, these are services
that people provide to people.

2787
02:50:13,140 --> 02:50:18,140
We just have this weird idea of deciding
what is and isn't acceptable as far as

2788
02:50:18,151 --> 02:50:22,320
a service. And as far as I'm
concerned, everything should be legal.

2789
02:50:22,350 --> 02:50:26,850
If it's not harming someone,
if, if sex is legal free,

2790
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:29,040
if it's legal for a woman,

2791
02:50:29,041 --> 02:50:33,510
and it should be for a woman to go
into any bar and choose a man that she

2792
02:50:33,511 --> 02:50:37,200
decides to have sex with, asked the guy
you want to fuck, and the guy goes, yeah,

2793
02:50:37,201 --> 02:50:40,050
and then she takes him home and has
sex with them. That's totally illegal.

2794
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:42,990
But if money's exchanged,
somehow, that woman is a criminal.

2795
02:50:43,590 --> 02:50:45,650
That we live in a crazy world we live in.

2796
02:50:45,690 --> 02:50:48,990
We were insane and we're
only insane because of these,

2797
02:50:49,290 --> 02:50:53,760
these echoes of the puritanical values
of the dip shits there were dressed up

2798
02:50:53,761 --> 02:50:57,060
like pilgrims and got on fucking wraps
and floated over here from Europe.

2799
02:50:57,130 --> 02:50:57,580
It's,
it's,

2800
02:50:57,580 --> 02:51:01,890
it's an even crazier idea to say that
you're going to control social interaction

2801
02:51:01,891 --> 02:51:06,420
and behavior, not by controlling the
act or by making the act illegal,

2802
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:09,960
but by making the transaction
of money itself illegal.

2803
02:51:10,040 --> 02:51:14,880
It's controlling the money is a very
dangerous road down which if we go,

2804
02:51:15,060 --> 02:51:18,990
people will use it to control all kinds
of other behaviors that perhaps they

2805
02:51:18,991 --> 02:51:21,900
shouldn't, that they're
lies. Totalitarianism.

2806
02:51:22,350 --> 02:51:27,350
Here's the points in the fact that
bitcoin can be used for these kinds of

2807
02:51:27,541 --> 02:51:30,810
activities is not something
special about bitcoin.

2808
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:32,880
All money can be used for
these kinds of activities.

2809
02:51:32,970 --> 02:51:36,900
What is special about Bitcoin is that you
can remove violence from the equation.

2810
02:51:36,901 --> 02:51:37,734
In many ways.

2811
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:42,360
The reason people buy drugs online is
because you can't get stabbed over TCP IP.

2812
02:51:42,810 --> 02:51:47,250
And that is a very callous
and throw away quip to make.

2813
02:51:47,730 --> 02:51:51,360
But it is true fundamentally if you
remove violence from the equation,

2814
02:51:51,390 --> 02:51:52,650
that increases the value.

2815
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:56,670
And so that's why people use this money.

2816
02:51:56,671 --> 02:52:01,620
That's what's special about bitcoin is
that it allows individuals to retain

2817
02:52:01,621 --> 02:52:06,100
control and it removes the possibility
of violence. I think a that's a good

2818
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:09,640
feature. It's a huge feature.
Listen man, we're out of time.

2819
02:52:09,641 --> 02:52:12,100
Thank you once again for illuminating us.

2820
02:52:12,101 --> 02:52:16,030
And you know it's funny you said the
first time you came on they will,

2821
02:52:16,090 --> 02:52:19,990
you'll be on in three months or four
months and things have changed so much and

2822
02:52:19,991 --> 02:52:23,920
I keep saying at what point in time
is it going to not change, but this,

2823
02:52:23,921 --> 02:52:26,860
it changed more in this
one than the last one.

2824
02:52:26,890 --> 02:52:30,910
So come back in a few months again
and we'll figure out what the fuck is

2825
02:52:30,911 --> 02:52:35,710
happening then. I Dunno what you foresee
taking place on the horizon, but I'm,

2826
02:52:35,711 --> 02:52:40,330
I'm in March, 2015
okay. Jurgen experience.

2827
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:43,750
Let's do it round for,
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in,

2828
02:52:43,751 --> 02:52:48,520
I'm full in on Bitcoin, I believe in
it. So to shooter Jennings, so fuck it.

2829
02:52:48,580 --> 02:52:53,110
So does tiger direct and Dell
computers and paypal and Brian is still

2830
02:52:53,111 --> 02:52:57,190
unconvinced. But once that fucking
escort site is up, he's in, uh,

2831
02:52:57,260 --> 02:53:01,420
a n t o n o p on Twitter.

2832
02:53:01,421 --> 02:53:06,070
That's um, that sign a. N t.

2833
02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:09,250
O. N. O. P. That's very confusing.

2834
02:53:09,450 --> 02:53:13,180
It's my first initial and my last name.
Well, you part of your land. Yeah.

2835
02:53:13,181 --> 02:53:15,790
That's all I could fit. There's
a lot you got along. That's true.

2836
02:53:15,791 --> 02:53:17,510
Because you don't want that.
You use that ad sign.

2837
02:53:17,511 --> 02:53:21,010
It eats up a lot of your 140
characters. Thank you very much, sir.

2838
02:53:21,910 --> 02:53:25,240
Brilliant talking to you. Oh, we always
enjoy it very much. So. All right.

2839
02:53:25,241 --> 02:53:30,160
We'll be back tomorrow. You fucks. So
enjoy. Go get yourself some bitcoin and a,

2840
02:53:30,170 --> 02:53:31,630
be cool to each other.
See you soon.

2841
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:37,510
Okay.
