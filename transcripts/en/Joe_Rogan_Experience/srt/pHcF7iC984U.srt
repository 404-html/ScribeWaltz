00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,790
Wait Baby Jesus on a pogo stick.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,500
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience.
This is a late night episode,

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,260
is brought to you by Squarespace.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,670
Squarespace is the all in one platform
that makes it fast and easy for you to

5
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:22,410
create your own professional website
and not like a bullshit professional

6
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:26,850
website, but like a really dope website.
I say dope. I'm almost 50. How about that?

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,290
I'm 46. I say dope. I don't give
a fuck. Say it cause I mean it.

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,660
They make dope websites.
Uh,

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,320
Squarespace has beautiful designs for
you to start with and all the style

10
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,500
options you need to create a unique
website for you and or your business.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,080
I know you probably like,
there's no way I can do this.

12
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,340
This is too fucking complicated.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,460
It's as easy as sending an email with
a picture in it. If you can do that,

14
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,830
if you can attach things,
if you can drag and drop,

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,790
it's very simple stuff and they offer 24,
seven support.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,560
You can make your own business and
you can start an online store with

17
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:01,890
Squarespace in a wicked easy fashion.

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,040
Squarespace also even has a logo creator.

19
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:10,041
You can create a clean customs simple
logo designed for yourself in minutes,

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,770
Buti fullness all by yourself.

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,690
Each design automatically includes a
unique mobile experience that matches the

22
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:22,230
overall style of your website. So if you
make a website website on Squarespace,

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,970
you can look at it on your iPhone.
You can look at it on a kindle device,

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,490
you can look at it on a laptop,

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,780
you can look at it on your
fucking android phone. You get me?

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,540
You understand what I'm saying?
Mac, PC, whatever, whatever.

30
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,500
A better web starts with your website,

31
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:53,670
but that's ridiculous because the
web is pretty fucking awesome. Ready?

Joe rogan.squarespace.com
enter in the code where Joe,

34
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,040
we're also brought to you by stamps.com
and with stamps.com is a way to avoid a

35
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,150
lot of the nonsense that goes along with
sending shit through the mail. Like,

36
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:11,850
let's say you start your own
website with Squarespace.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,180
You start selling shit at a Squarespace,
then you've got to send it. Oh,

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,710
good googly Mowgli son.

39
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:20,880
You do not want to have to
go to the fucking post office
and wait in line with a

40
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:24,120
bunch of other people that don't
want to be waiting in line and up.

41
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,710
Poor person behind the counter.

42
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:28,410
It's got to measure all
your shit and package it up.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,630
You can get rid of all those steps and
handle it all completely from your home

44
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:38,520
while drunk and naked and it's totally
legal and you do it through your

45
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:41,160
computer. You stamps.com you
don't have to get drunk and naked.

46
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,050
It's just a suggestion and I don't know,

47
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,780
like how you deal with things when
you're naked or when you're drunk.

48
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,040
You might make poor choices,

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,830
so you might not want to use
stamps.com when you're drunk and naked,

50
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,430
but if you're sober in your home, you can
do, we'll do whatever the fuck you want.

51
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:54,264
What am I your dad?

52
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,960
My point is that you can print official
us postage right there from your home

53
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,481
computer.

54
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:06,130
Slap that shit on a box and weigh it with
the digital scale that they provide as

55
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,910
a part of this delicious $110 package,

56
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,880
which includes up to 55
bucks of free postage.

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,670
Squarespace is an awesome way to start
a website and stamps.com is an awesome

58
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:22,900
way to sell shit. I like that they go
hand in hand. Do you see how I rock shit.

59
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,960
Amy Schumer craziness.

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,530
stamps.com has been used by
Brian red band for a long time.

61
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:34,030
If you buy one of his cool kittycat tee
shirts that he designs and makes himself,

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,540
those are all sent through stamps.com uh,

63
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,770
it's also how Christina Palicki and Tom
Segura when they send your mom's house

64
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:45,190
stuff, they use stamps.com too.

71
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,520
We're almost home where
at the homestretch.

72
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,300
We're also brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com that's o n n I t,

73
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,220
a human optimization website.

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,910
And that name was only created because
there's no other way to describe it.

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,740
It seems a little douchey and pretentious.
We're about human optimization, but uh,

76
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:26,920
that's really what we're about. So there's
no other way to say it unfortunately.

77
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,000
Uh,

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,090
it sounds good until you're talking to
someone who's skeptical and then looking

79
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,930
at you like, what bitch the fuck you're
talking about human optimization website.

80
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:38,080
What, what kind of nonsense?
Strength and conditioning equipment.

81
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,220
That's what I'm talking about,
bitch.

82
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,540
We still kettlebells and on it both
regular kettlebells and artistic ones,

83
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,430
we have these primal bells, which
are all the great apes, gorillas,

84
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,640
orangutans, chimpanzees and little howler
monkeys. And we also made Zombie Bells.

85
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,150
This is the most recent one.

86
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,370
All these were done by a guy named Steven
Shubin jr bad ass artist created these

87
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,740
awesome things and then we made them
out of metal and they are all three d

88
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:09,010
balanced. So although you know, they
look cool and everything like that.

89
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,770
We also wanted to make sure they're
completely, totally functional.

90
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,900
I use the 70 of course the gorilla because
I'm a fucking manly man and I've got

91
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:20,860
no time for your bullshit. And if you're
preparing for the Zombie Apocalypse, um,

92
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,520
what better way than prepare
with a fucking metal Zombie
head and they will last

93
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:25,060
you forever.

94
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,930
Like literally after the apocalypse
comes and the aliens land and they try to

95
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:29,980
decipher our culture,

96
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,130
they'll find a few fucking Zombie heads
and gorilla gorilla heads and you're

97
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:38,410
like, what the fuck are these people
into? They will never figure it out.

98
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,370
Mark my words, they would never
fucking figure it out. They were like,

99
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,770
they worship the gods of the
monkeys. No, you'd dummies.

100
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,870
We worked out with them on a.com o.

101
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:51,871
N n I t use the Codeword Rogan and
you will save 10% off any and all

102
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:56,080
supplements. That's o. N. N.
I. T. The code word is Rogan.

103
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:58,520
Amy Schumer is here.
Why fuck

104
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,443
around

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,740
the Joe Rogan experience.

106
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,590
Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

107
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,860
Amy Schumer. Hello. Can we
start every show that you're on?

108
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:19,270
Like that was a little song. Powerful Amy
Schumer Song. I would love it. Thank you.

109
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,600
So [inaudible] on stage that
way. Why not? You could do it.

110
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,080
You could demand that people have
riders. Yeah. Why do people have riders?

111
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,290
You know, I put a lot of weird shit in
there, like white m and m's and fucking,

112
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,700
I heard I have the cheapest.

113
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:33,210
The Guy I've been on the road was that
I have the cheapest writers ever seen it

114
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:36,180
as Lilly. Yes. Cheapest. Like
what's your rider? What do you do?

115
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,060
You will you require,

116
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,650
it's like honestly,

117
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,240
vegetables and fruit for a smoothie
with some Greek yogurt. It's just like,

118
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:47,830
he's like, yeah. And their wine, which
I tell him to hide from me unless I ask,

119
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,610
what about a Pale white sneakers?
I should do that. Cleaning hip hop.

120
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,890
I need a hip hop vibe.

121
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:58,160
I've gotten nothing where there's some
artists that do demand things like that.

122
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,950
They demand like, uh, every time
I go to one of these places,

123
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,720
I always asked the guys backstage like,

124
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,140
what's the craziest Shit you've ever seen?
Yeah,

125
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:08,000
because a lot of these dudes that are
like working in these comedy clubs or

126
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:11,150
these, especially these theaters that
have seen like rock and roll bands coming

127
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,490
through. Right. You always want
to know like what? Come on man.

128
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:14,660
What's the craziest Shit you've seen?

129
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,590
Just rock and roll coke stories for
the most part it's what everybody has.

130
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,110
I mean I wouldn't repeat the stories can,

131
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,320
wouldn't want to get anybody in trouble,

132
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,410
but they're mostly just coke
and naked people stories.

133
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,270
Funniest one I ever heard was Tj Miller.
That comics,

134
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,060
he asked for either an actual or a picture
of opinion in the green and so like

135
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,780
sometimes the promoter has to like
draw the picture of opinion. I'm like,

136
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:42,140
that's awesome. I wish I've, I've
gotten nothing exciting on there.

137
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,240
But until recently there was some mistake.

138
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:47,630
We're told drivers not to look at me or
not to talk to me like something was in

139
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:50,420
there and in December I heard
that and I go, oh my God,

140
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:52,850
that's not supposed to be there.
Please take that out. And they haven't,

141
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,600
I just found out they didn't.
So it's cause I'm always like,

142
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:01,250
why is there such horrible tension in
this on this ride? And then they're like,

143
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,220
they're like, and I'll talk
to them, they're like, oh,
you know what says some nuts.

144
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,540
And I'm like, oh my God, that's so
embarrassing. Like me being like, no,

145
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,680
don't talk to me.

146
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,570
I've had that in my rider accidentally
as well. Not even accidentally.

147
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,080
Like it was a conversation that
somebody must have had someone like you

148
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:20,110
shouldn't talk to him. It's like,
what are you talking about? Like that.

149
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,983
That's ridiculous.

150
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,943
Yeah.

151
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,600
I used to be really pained by small talk
actually like on the road because you

152
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:28,170
have so many little interactions.
But,

153
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,370
but Colin Quinn like really
turned me on to small talk.

154
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,960
He goes so hard and the small talk
that like people go the other way.

155
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:39,830
Like he just like an art form to him.
He won one driver at a time.

156
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,960
One person who works at a hotel,
like he just,

157
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:44,870
he'll small talk you to death and it,
and it really has,

158
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,470
it really has like sorta
changed the road for me. Okay.

159
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,160
I've had some great drivers. I had
some really, really hilarious dues.

160
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,010
I had a dude in New Orleans that grew
up in New Orleans and it had no idea how

161
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,230
New Orleans was in relationships
I've ever been in. Yeah. And,

162
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,180
and in comparison to
the rest of the country,

163
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,790
like there's certain things you just
get away with a New Orleans like walking

164
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:07,500
down the street with an open beer. Like he
was, the cops pulled him over, he was a,

165
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,950
and he was only like, you know, a
couple hours outside of New Orleans.

166
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,740
He said he drove a couple hours
and he's out there with a beer,

167
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,603
like sitting there,

168
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:19,080
a bias car drinking this beer and the
cop pulls over and the cop starts asking

169
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:22,770
him questions and while the cops talk and
tell him he puts the one beer down and

170
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,360
cracks open. Another one, oh my God.

171
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,460
And like nothing starts drinking the
second beer. And the cop was like,

172
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:32,070
are you out of your fucking
mind? Like what are you
doing? He goes, wait a minute,

173
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,730
the car goes, where are you from? And the
guy goes New Orleans and he's like, oh,

174
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,810
okay, listen, you can't do
that here. Right. You can't
do that anywhere else. Yeah.

175
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,330
You live in a crazy place.

176
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,660
Such a cultural, I love it there. That's
my, that's also my favorite place.

177
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:48,920
But I've seen, I've seen the worst stuff.
They're the worst, the worst violence,

178
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,580
the combination of everything bad.
And I went to college in Baltimore,

179
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,690
like e not a coincidence that
they filmed the wire there. Uh,

180
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,250
but in New Orleans,

181
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:02,390
I was like 17 I was her and a volleyball
tournament and I was in a hog and Nas

182
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,830
and I saw these two guys
straight from the by you.

183
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,030
And they were talking,

184
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,000
they were both like hitting on this
girl and they didn't know that it was a

185
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:14,980
hooker and they didn't know that it was a
guy, you know, and it was, I was like 17.

186
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,340
I was like, Ooh, that's dark.

187
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:19,430
And they were both like celebrating
that this hot girl was talking to them.

188
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:23,360
And I was like, oh, one of them is about
to catch a deck. That's hilarious. Yeah.

189
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,980
That happened. I love
that city. It's like,

190
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,080
yeah. A friend of mine wants to California
and my friend Eddie were in, um,

191
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,110
we were right by the comedy store,
you know that hotel by the comedy store,

192
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,740
that ramp that's going up. Yeah.
And this woman was driving up the,

193
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:39,520
up the hill and my friend Eddie was like,
to that check is so fucking hot.

194
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,990
Oh my God, look how hot
that girl is. Yeah. And uh,

195
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,030
she was a transvestite who
had a transsexual that had
done a piece on the man

196
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:52,050
show with us. And I said, oh, I know her.
And I'm like, she's a, he. He's like,

197
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,290
no fucking way. I go, well, not anymore.
She's not. Yeah, she used to be,

198
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,950
I guess she's still kind of is because
she has a penis till. Yeah. What was it?

199
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,620
A transsexual.
A transvestite.

200
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,790
Transsexual is someone who
has gotten their sex change.

201
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,140
Transvestite is someone who's
dressed, dressed as a woman. You know,

202
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:13,620
you could be a cross dresser too. Yeah,
he's kind of weird when you defined,

203
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,840
you know like what they are like what did,
what did,

204
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,810
what does a person who dresses
like a wall? Norton fuck them.

205
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,180
But I mean not even if they,

206
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,900
I mean not even like a sexual thing cause
if it address like I think you can be

207
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:28,590
a transvestite and be completely uh,
heterosexual

208
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,970
like Eddie Izzard I think just
cross dresses or he did anyway,

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,660
but doesn't like it very straight I think.

210
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,890
I don't know. You know, I, I don't
know why he did that, but it worked.

211
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,730
Whatever it is, stop. And it's obvious
that he's got talent outside of that,

212
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,130
but whatever it is, he worked. He um,

213
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,010
he did an amazing thing once
where he ran around Europe.

214
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,140
Did you ever see that documentary?
No.

215
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,390
My respect for him shot through
the roof. See, that annoyed me.

216
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:57,280
I don't even know anything about it,
but him doing that,

217
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,930
like it makes me feel lazy
and right away I'm like,

218
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,620
you don't have to see it to
understand what he did. Um,

219
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,970
because it was incredibly impressive.
It was, I guess it was on the UK,

220
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,270
on TV and it didn't get on TV in America.
You've got to watch on the Internet,

221
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,520
but he ran like every day
run a marathon and yeah,

222
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,770
he ran all around Europe.
It's the saying what he did was insane.

223
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,450
It also does is act like an Arabic.

224
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,820
He does is acting like a bunch
of different languages. Yeah,

225
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:22,760
he's a bad motherfucker.

226
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,490
Tell him whatever he does it and he's
a bad motherfucker. That guy's amazing.

227
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,700
He ran around the fucking, I mean he's
not an athlete. This is the thing.

228
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:35,290
He didn't do it when he was in shape. He
did it when he was fat. He just did it.

229
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,330
He just forced his body to do it.

230
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:40,840
He finished a 1,100 mile
marathon around Britain

231
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,230
and that's exactly so right away. You
like just respect that cause, right?

232
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,861
Oh my God.

233
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:50,410
Are you running from what you're trying
to escape from and maybe that's my

234
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:54,370
defense mechanism. No, I don't think he's
doing escaping or running from anything.

235
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:57,490
He did it all for charity and he was,
he had a goal.

236
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,320
You set this goal in his mind and he just
decided to try to complete this goal.

237
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,670
What was the traffic charity?
Jamie, does it say sports?

238
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,260
Eddie is finishing. I don't know.
I don't know. He looks great.

239
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,940
That might just be a website that
sponsored it. There was some,

240
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:16,360
some aspect of it was
a related to charity.

241
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,580
How his body transformed
during the time he did it.

242
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,910
He ran a hot shit and fucking miles,

243
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,710
but like he had the most
horrendous blisters on his feet.

244
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,730
I mean his skin was torn apart on his
feet just because his body was just so

245
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,680
unused to this.

246
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,970
I mean that's something you could try
just trying to build up to running a

247
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:38,770
marathon. Just a marathon. A,

248
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,360
that's how fucking serious
physical undertaking 26
mile right now. I'd be like,

249
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,980
whatever the charity, I couldn't do it.
This guy did a hundred of them. I mean,

250
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,510
Jesus Christ, it means how many
[inaudible], how many did he run?

251
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,360
30 or something like that. 43 marathons.
They didn't even put it on TV and all.

252
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,430
We're all of them. A standard marathon
rate of 26 miles. Is that what it is?

253
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,600
That's a marathon. 26 miles.
Yeah. That's incredible.

254
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,590
Is that the youtube video
or like a website? No, there
is a youtube video of it.

255
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:11,890
You could watch the whole thing every
step of the way and there was parts of it

256
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:14,380
where he was running really,
really, really, really slow,

257
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,000
but he did not fucking quit. It's
incredible. Like you, you know,

258
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,850
you just look at this guy pushing himself.
His knees are falling apart,

259
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:24,790
it's feats falling apart and he just
gets up there and he just fucking keeps

260
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,630
running. I just think I can't, I can't
help it. I'm like, what's he running from?

261
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,290
But why is he running from something
if he's trying to accomplish something,

262
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,420
accomplish something.
Right.

263
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,180
Like you don't want to date anybody
that shows up at the gym at 6:00 AM like

264
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:45,181
come on crazy motivated and wanting
to take care of yourself is one thing.

265
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,040
But then I think something that insane.

266
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,010
I mean if it's the raise money
for charity, like why don't you do

267
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,440
stand up and they'll put
that on TV in America.

268
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,840
You got a goal,
set a goal to see if he could pull it off.

269
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,800
I think we have to agree to disagree
cause like I don't think it's cool and I

270
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:05,150
like him and like I think he's
really funny and so I, I feel bad.

271
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,530
No look you've got a point,
you've got a point.

272
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,680
I mean why not just ask people to donate
the money or donate the money yourself

273
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:12,190
or you've got a point.
I mean,

274
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,310
but not like, I mean of course
then why even have a fundraiser?

275
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,430
But I'm just saying to do
that. Ah, I don't know.

276
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:23,060
I know zero about it except what you've
just told me. But, but it right away.

277
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:23,810
That's what I think.

278
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,960
Well, so here's the, here's another
optimistic way of looking at it,

279
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:31,700
or positive way of looking at it.
He's also on top of what he's doing.

280
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:34,710
He's inspiring people because what he did,

281
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:36,550
it's skin is an incredible accomplishment.
Yeah.

282
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,680
Running 1100 miles or whatever
the fucking room hire you to do.

283
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,520
What did you inspire me?
Do anything inspire that feeling in me.

284
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,950
I wanted to fucking,
I don't even know what the charity is.

285
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,900
You just thought like,
well,

286
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,900
you just appreciate humans like doing
amazing shit and I just don't like, yeah.

287
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,990
Every year. The marathon. No,

288
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:59,030
but I really like going down to the
marathon in New York and like rooting.

289
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,890
So like, everyone's so excited to like
really emotional, but I'm like, you know,

290
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,080
do you give a shit about the Olympics
when the Olympics come around? I,

291
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,880
I not the Winter Olympics, I just cannot
give a shit about the winter Olympics.

292
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:13,510
But I liked the, I liked gymnastics.
I get into some, some Olympics.

293
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,810
You know, what's the biggest tragedy
in all sports? Is that the Olympics?

294
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,760
That they don't pay the athletes.
Oh,

295
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:22,950
I thought it was like duping
amounts of money. No, the those are,

296
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,880
those are professional athletes.
You know,

297
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:28,120
the idea that they're amateur
athletes is fucking preposterous.

298
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,570
The amount of revenue that gets generated
by their athletic performance as

299
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,890
fucking staggering. Wait,
because it's so much. Yes.

300
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,530
It's an incredible amount of
money. All of them, right.

301
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,760
It's an incredible amount of money
that the Olympics itself generates.

302
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,730
The Olympics itself.
When people are watching the Olympics,

303
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:49,720
there's fucking millions of
people around the world. Untold,

304
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:51,340
millions watching at the same time,

305
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,390
and the advertising revenue
revenue is stupendous. I mean,

306
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,830
they must make unbelievable
amounts of money, right?

307
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,240
It costs a lot of money to put it on.
It's not a free event,

308
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:05,260
but the amount of profit that is
generated by the Olympics must be fucking

309
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:09,280
phenomenal. Yeah. It's an excellent
opportunity for young athletes. You know,

310
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:13,420
it'd be more excellent. Pay Him
Bitch, give them some fucking money.

311
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,300
He's not a little money either.
I'll a shit ton of money

312
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,690
they have.

313
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,420
They throw away their entire childhoods
and then like one of them makes a lot of

314
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:23,960
money and like there's like a dozen
girls never getting their period.

315
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,500
There should be something you
could watch them for a week.

316
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,960
There should be some sort of scale,
you know,

317
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:32,560
where a certain amount of accomplishment
leads to a certain amount of revenue.

318
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,150
Yeah.

319
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,740
Yeah. Cause that's the thing, when
you're younger you're like, Oh,

320
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,600
if you make it to the Olympics,
you're just rich.

321
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:39,850
Like I thought it was like hunger
games and you were like a victor.

322
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:44,290
You just like when so much money. Right.
But really it's like why even ballerinas?

323
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,730
I'm like,
oh my God.

324
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,560
Only like a handful of you make it where
you can make a bunch of money still

325
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:52,200
you're just beating your body to,
to a pulp.

326
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,730
But then a lot of them like never
even get there and make no money.

327
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,580
A lot of them. Right? Like
what's the number? I don't, um,

328
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,453
I don't know.

329
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,140
I talked to a ballerina last season
of my show and she said like,

330
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:11,550
if you're starring in a ballet,
if you're like the New York Ballerina,

331
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,120
you make like I think under 500 a year

332
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,630
and that's the best ballerina.
But this,

333
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,120
I dunno how much scrolling do Olympic
athletes actually make some money.

334
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,250
Okay. It does say they do. This
is the, the actual numbers,

335
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,140
the Olympic Committee awards,

336
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:34,250
cash prizes to Olympians who
when a metal $25,000 for a gold,

337
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,850
$15,000 for silver and
$10,000 for a bronze,

338
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,920
but the money is considered earn income
abroad and subject to Irx taxation.

339
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:47,210
So when you win an Olympic gold
medal, you went $25,000 which is, hey,

340
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,320
so depressing. That's an, that's a,
you know, hey, that's a good wage.

341
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,320
If you're,
I'm a fucking burger.

342
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,430
That's horrible.
It's an unbelievable that you,

343
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,470
that you're like the person
that they're like, okay,

344
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:05,250
now like Nike or somebody wants
to, exactly. You'll get sponsored.

345
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,570
You'll be sponsored by
several different companies.

346
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:09,370
You'll make some money off of that.
And you know,

347
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,350
maybe you'll be able to
do seminars and shit.

348
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,560
25 you get the gold. I talked
to a model fuckers. I was like,

349
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:17,030
what am models make like are they just,

350
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,200
but the ones at the very top of the
game of course are making tons of money,

351
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:26,201
but like really beautiful chicks that
are working models make around that.

352
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,380
Like they make like maybe 50 grand a year

353
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,580
from what I've heard.

354
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,240
My Buddy's dating this
chick who is a model

355
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,360
and he calls me at all in quotes.
She's, she's like a real model,

356
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,730
doesn't advertise in campaigns and she
makes some touch to make $6,000 a day,

357
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:49,360
$15,000 in a day.
She's made as much as $25,000 in a day.

358
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,800
Just posing. She's not
famous. She's young. Yeah,

359
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,120
just stupid amounts of money.

360
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,990
Um, I think it varies is
what I'm trying to say.

361
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,590
But even like trying on a big campaign,
I think it varies,

362
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,060
but I know only like three models.
But they, they work and they,

363
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,760
they've gotten a campaign here.
There they are on the runway.

364
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,280
And it sounds like once
it's like a corporate,

365
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:13,680
like once in a while they'll make a,
they'll have a pretty good pay day,

366
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:17,070
but it's not consistent
and it's not that much.

367
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,260
It didn't sound like that
much to me for being hungry

368
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,490
on some of them isn't it?
It's just they can do it naturally.

369
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,170
Like some of them don't
have to struggle as much

370
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,300
like weight loss, body shape, that
ectomorphic body shape. Like the,

371
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,740
honestly I've only talked to three models
because it's not fun to be around that,

372
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,420
but uh, but they, um, even if they're
like naturally pretty thin, they still,

373
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:43,220
before doing that stuff
had to do liquid stuff and,

374
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,040
and uh, what's the thing where you
shoot salient in your, in your,

375
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,830
in your butthole, she'd
salient. Oh, that thing.

376
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:54,850
What do you are you're
talking about an enema? Oh,

377
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:58,240
I thought it was like a treatment or
something you do before you make me do

378
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:02,970
before the show. This place
seems that clean. That's
clean it. Trust me. It's just,

379
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,280
it looks rustic. Oh, I love doing his
punk ass, but he's always giving me

380
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,433
weird,

381
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,460
pulled through the same issue.
You're ready?

382
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,640
What did,
what the fuck is it about anybody?

383
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,470
Like why would anybody get really hung
up on the idea of incredibly skinny

384
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:33,220
people were in their clothes? I
don't know, but it looks good.

385
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,620
But what I've heard is
that it's like a hanger.

386
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,280
That's the idea that you want them
almost built like a hangar. Well,

387
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:42,270
I just had a fitting
today and it was like, um,

388
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,190
with someone who knew what they were
doing, which I haven't had that much of,

389
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,940
you know,

390
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,750
and she told me that it's all about
proportion because like a lot of people,

391
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:52,510
they think that I'm like actually
bigger than I am. Like people,

392
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,540
I'm a size six and people and what that
means like bigger than a four smaller

393
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,950
entity anyway. But um, but
then they've been like,

394
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,250
there's some websites or whatever
cause you can like be like,

395
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:09,680
what's her bra size or what's her
size and come back and be like, yeah,

396
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,240
I think there's like websites that say
I'm like a 12 or something, but whatever.

397
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,480
But anyway,
it's all about proportion and not,

398
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:19,780
and not really about how big
or small somebody actually is,

399
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,630
but these models that do the best
that the clothes look the best.

400
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,560
It is like a hanger.

401
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:27,610
They're like basically frail up
here and it looks but close look,

402
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,200
all clothes look dope on them,

403
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:31,990
but there's only like a very small
amount of of checks that you can,

404
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,720
you can work with.

405
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,720
I think there's also a very different
feeling that a woman has when she looks at

406
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:42,070
another woman than a man has when he
looks at a woman as far as like what looks

407
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:45,820
good and what doesn't look good.
Girls do that.

408
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,390
Girls think look good.

409
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,780
They'll dress or certain things
that they'll buy purses and shit,

410
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:55,060
especially to impress,

411
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,020
impress a guy with a purse,
but women are like real.

412
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,290
Some of them are like really into
purses to impress each other.

413
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,790
I like shoes, purses,
jewelry. I know nothing.

414
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,560
I don't have that. Like I'm
missing that. I'm just like,

415
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,310
no. I think I can be like, oh,
that girl like looks great,

416
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:19,180
but I don't even aspire to try
it because it seems so out of my,

417
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,550
out of my range. Um, but I can
look at a girl and be like, wow,

418
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:26,730
she's beautiful, but I'm
not like, oh, like, let me,

419
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,810
I wonder what she looks like naked.
You know,

420
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:31,360
obviously because I'm
not attracted to girls.

421
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:35,800
I sound like I'm like defending myself.
But, um, but it's so weird to me,

422
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,890
but I understand it cause I feel
like when someone's really thin,

423
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,260
like all the things that
we want to do naturally,

424
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:45,800
like eat and fuck and everything,
we like celebrate people that

425
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,120
are able to abstain the most from
that. Like, like, like, Oh God,

426
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,830
she really knows how to starve
herself. Or, um, like, yeah,

427
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:56,600
like she's just,

428
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,250
we sort of like celebrate people
just keeping themselves from biology.

429
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,320
That's a big one for women to write. The,
the ability to abstain. It's very, um,

430
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,140
it's like, uh, it's a badge of
courage or something. It's like, no,

431
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,220
I can't add a verbal, nothing
wrong. Well, why should you?

432
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,240
It's out of my wheelhouse. Good idea
that we're supposed to, it's so crazy.

433
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:20,030
The only problem with women is of course
if there's so many guys that are pieces

434
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:24,950
of shit and the men are more dangerous
in there physically in the pieces of shit

435
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:26,010
that you run into.
Yeah.

436
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,420
Whereas women are more dangerous maybe
financially in the pieces of shit that

437
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:32,630
you run into. What do you mean? Well,
you know, if a guy gets fucked over,

438
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:35,560
usually guys get fucked
over in a financial way. Um,

439
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,370
like divorces or they get
set up like I've seen it,

440
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,520
I've seen guys get set up
and it's very disturbing

441
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,310
guy with any money. Like I seriously
have never even dated. Yeah.

442
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,470
Guy I've met, um, I, I've, I've met
guys where I watched them go down,

443
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,140
like saw it happening.
They were not attractive.

444
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,990
They were uncomfortable with women and
they had all of a sudden this really hot

445
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:59,991
girl with them who likes slowly but
surely stocks are way in this position and

446
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,240
then bales with a of

447
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,520
cash. Then how like isn't the
transparent, don't these guys that are 80,

448
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:08,410
aren't they?
Why aren't they curious?

449
00:25:08,411 --> 00:25:13,300
Like why this beautiful Kate Upton
look alike like is in love with them?

450
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,170
I'm suspicious of any guys better looking
than me that wants to sleep with me.

451
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,900
I'm like, what? Why? Like
what do you think I can show
you. I'm not gay. I'm Shim,

452
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,720
don't you? But don't you wonder? And
I know a lot of, I know not a lot,

453
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:28,930
but I know a handful of women that had
guys take their money because I think

454
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:33,460
women aren't to happen even
more susceptible to like
just wanting that love and

455
00:25:33,461 --> 00:25:36,610
being like, sure. Joint checking.
I'll buy a house in our name.

456
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,470
Well, I don't think it's
mutually exclusive. I mean,

457
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:42,550
you can get ripped off no matter
what your sex is. Sexual preference.

458
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:45,400
I'm sure gay guys rib each other off
and gay women rip each other. Right.

459
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:47,950
As a matter of fact, I
know they do. I'm so like,

460
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,930
I know a gay woman who has to pay alimony.

461
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,230
My great grandma was a bootlegger
and she was always, yeah.

462
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,480
Her liquor store is still on 54th
street Schumer's liquors. Wow.

463
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,120
But she for street wear, um,
uh, in between park and Lex or,

464
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:04,290
or a male isn't like, yeah, it's
right across from monkey bar.

465
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,300
That is fucking awesome. What a
great story. But she um, she was,

466
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,730
she was just pounding it into
my head like that. Cause she,

467
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:14,670
I think her husband tried to steal money
from her, but she like put it away.

468
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:15,990
She's always like,
save your money.

469
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:21,320
Good for her. Yeah. You know,
it can happen. I mean you
get with the wrong person,

470
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:24,440
the wrong guy, the wrong girl,
whatever. That can definitely happen.

471
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:29,240
But I think that happens more with men.

472
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,320
Men tend to be the ones who have more
money in the relationships. I don't know.

473
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:35,360
I'm not saying that women do, they
make 70, I don't know what it is,

474
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,420
but whatever it is, I'm not saying
that women can't make money on,

475
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:41,090
don't jump down my throat. I'm
just, no, I'm not saying you,

476
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:44,010
I'm saying people out there on the
Internet. I wish that, I wish that

477
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,210
I've ever dated a guy. And then you think
[inaudible] steel. Yeah. I'm, I make,

478
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,840
I make a good amount of money now, you
know, and like, so it's weird like, yeah,

479
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:53,700
because guys are just like,
and I'm like,

480
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,040
Oh yes. Pass to. First of all,

481
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:04,041
I cannot pretend to be
interested in basketball and any,

482
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,660
I like going to games, but I can't, like,

483
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:09,450
I don't ever want to be like
wearing a jersey and being like,

484
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,830
I just don't want to do that athlete.
Do you know,

485
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,180
I still haven't been with a black guy.
Isn't that pathetic? Maybe I'm scared.

486
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:22,170
I'll be under the Detroit. You'll
be dancing. You'll, you'll change.

487
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:28,110
Start wearing beads. I'll wear a
Jersey is addressed. Big Hoop earrings.

488
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,550
Hardcore. We want to VH one reality
show. Like fighting with other chicks.

489
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,620
You'll, you'll be fine. I don't think
so. Change your personality entirely.

490
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,510
I had one encounter with a huge
deck and I talked about, um,

491
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,150
my last special I tapped out. I
was like, no way. Well, maybe,

492
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:56,100
I mean,
how many ways are there to use it go like

493
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,340
really big?
Like what are you supposed to do?

494
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,890
You just have to like stretch.
Yeah. I was like, I'm not,

495
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,570
we're not gonna have a life together.
I'm not going to power through this.

496
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,260
Or you change your shape.
How about stretches out?

497
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:15,910
Just like when a woman has her breasts?

498
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,790
No, regular plus super athletes.
Probably constantly horny. Oh my God,

499
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,090
no. Are the, our athletes is
known as being oh yeah, for sure.

500
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,840
I would imagine.

501
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,750
I'm never in a relationship where it's
like I have the same sexual appetite is

502
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:37,381
the guy I'm dating.

503
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:42,120
It's either like they are like wanting
it too much or it's me wanting it too

504
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:46,210
much. Like it's, I've never
really had it even out of you.

505
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,270
Yeah. Yeah. Where it's been like
that's good. That's encouraging.

506
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,360
It definitely happens. It's hard.
Think it's way harder for a check.

507
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,910
I mean I'm just guessing. I
think so. Cause it's what?

508
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,890
I don't know if like if your girl is like,
no,

509
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:08,880
not tonight. Does it like
hurt your feelings? Are you
like what's wrong with me?

510
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:13,700
Or you're just like, uh, no he
doesn't want to or whatever.

511
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,690
But also you've been,
you know,

512
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,490
if you're with somebody for
a long time it's different.

513
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:20,890
I don't think there's any reason why,
you know,

514
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,860
two people can't figure out that they're
not sexually compatible and if you

515
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,520
start dating each other and you'd get
to a point where you're like spending a

516
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:33,070
lot of time together and then
you hit those, that thing.

517
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,360
Whoa,
okay.

518
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,300
We're figuring out what's important here
because there's a bunch of shit that's

519
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:41,980
important here.
The big important one is caring about each

520
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,140
other and having a good time together.
That's the number one, right?

521
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,303
That's number one.

522
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,370
But number two is you like to fuck each
other and if you don't put it at number

523
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:55,060
two, what are you putting in? Number two?
Yeah. What is there? What's number two?

524
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,980
Financial security mean? What?
Is it a coexisting interest? No,

525
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:03,850
I have almost nothing co
interest with my wife.

526
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,050
There's not one thing that she likes up
a few TV shows and some art things and

527
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:09,970
some but her off her hobbies,

528
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,700
like things that she enjoys to just her
things and then you know, we, we hang out,

529
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,321
we have fun together.

530
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:19,120
Like you don't have to have the
same mutual desires or the same,

531
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:21,220
you can not have to be
into the same sports.

532
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:25,600
Like I've actually heard guys say that
they would never date a girl that doesn't

533
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:28,810
watch sports because the last thing
you want is her complaining when you're

534
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:31,840
watching sports. Fuck that. She doesn't
watch sports. I don't want to date him.

535
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:36,170
Yeah, I haven't seen on the, on my show
tomorrow night about that. Oh really?

536
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,640
I'm not trying to work
it in. It's called, um,

537
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,600
Chica can hang and I just want to
tell you about it, but it's, yeah,

538
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:44,960
it's guys sitting around, they're
like, I just want to go like, oh,

539
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,010
she'd like a lantern jaw and like really?

540
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,970
Like she does my fantasy picks and then
you realize they're just describing

541
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,600
dude's like, it's just, but I mean I know,

542
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,460
I know girls that are are real
into sports but, and I'm not,

543
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,710
but the difference is I'm, I don't,
I don't care about sports at all,

544
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,360
but I'm not like,

545
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,920
and I don't want you to like I'm busy
and I'm psyched to do my thing and I have

546
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:15,000
my interests and like please do you,

547
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,420
I saw a tweet once where girls are the
girls who were into football get bigger

548
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:20,254
diamonds,

549
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,960
Twitter pictures and like
a bunch of people like
retweeted it and I think it was

550
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:28,960
like a girl, like a sexy football
outfit on or something. You know,

551
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,510
that's so awful.
And I feel like that's like the image of,

552
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,990
that's like what girls see and
even I've been going cause um,

553
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,890
the NBA is like a big part of this
movie then I'm going to do okay.

554
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,020
Oh Shit.
What did I say?

555
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,150
Amy Gets on Black Dick
Photo first time shit.

556
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:47,940
I don't even know if I was on outstanding.
Oh, don't say it didn't happen.

557
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,590
But anyway,
nobody remembers on the Internet.

558
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,360
But anyway, like you
know, seeing these, uh,

559
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,590
just seeing the way women are represented
on TV, like all these real housewives,

560
00:31:57,591 --> 00:32:01,940
like no one's doing. Even if they're
like, oh, we had like this luncheon for,

561
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,310
for charity, like good, whatever.

562
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,900
The thing that's getting edited and what
we're seeing is you guys being monsters

563
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:11,990
and like this is these shows. This
is what girls are seeing. Like,

564
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,170
I don't have any, I know jewelry, like,
I don't know the girls that I'm close to,

565
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,890
no one cares about a handbag.
No one, no one gives a shit.

566
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:22,040
But that's not the girls that you see
on television. They're all comics.

567
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,830
They're all like, oh, see

568
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,830
they're all Rachel Feinstein,
Nikki Glaser.

569
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:31,380
Oh yeah. You're all a bunch of artists.
You're all trying to be comedians. If you,

570
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,060
if her comic like all of a sudden became
incredibly obsessed with keeping like

571
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:38,310
an upstanding or attractive appearance,

572
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,440
that would immediately preclude a
lot of the comedy. Yeah. You know,

573
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:46,670
because you weren't, you
wouldn't be relaxed at all.
You'd be like such a, you're,

574
00:32:46,671 --> 00:32:49,190
you're inciting like a a look,

575
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,540
a way of someone looking at you
like look at Harvard there pag. Mm.

576
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,730
What did that dress probably
costs a lot of money.

577
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,890
Leave the people care about
that stuff and it's not,

578
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:01,030
I think I'm better than that.
It's honestly insane to me. It's,

579
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:06,230
it's insane to me that anybody would
put value on like just that it's so

580
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:11,320
transparent. Like look, this is expensive.
Like I just, I think that's so cool.

581
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,830
Totally right.
But let's play devil's advocate.

582
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,240
What if you are just really
into beautifully crafted things,

583
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,000
whether it's a watch
or whether it's a car,

584
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:26,001
whether it's a purse isn't impossible
that it couldn't that I see that a lot of

585
00:33:26,191 --> 00:33:27,600
people,
I believe you're right,

586
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:30,720
a lot of people there watching that
stuff and they're looking at different

587
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:33,510
people that have different
things and they want to show off.

588
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,050
They want to show everybody that they've
got the purse that costs x or the shoes

589
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:40,190
that cost. Why are all my God look at
the size of the rock she's got, right?

590
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,030
There's certainly people
that won't do that,

591
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,020
but isn't it possible that there's
other people that could just enjoy a

592
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:48,710
beautiful purse or enjoy a beautiful home?

593
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,830
I also haven't,
I haven't like seen that.

594
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:54,410
I don't know anyone with really
expensive stuff. So if someone was like,

595
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:56,000
look at this,
watch it costs 20 grand,

596
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,970
like I've never seen that and maybe
I'd be like, wow, that's amazing.

597
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,190
I'm about comfort. And like
I like traveling, you know,
I like, my bed is expensive.

598
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:07,970
Like I like, you know, things that
sort of lend themselves to experience,

599
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:11,810
but I haven't seen, but you know what, if
you have so much money and you're like,

600
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,870
oh I want to get this beautiful
thing. I understand that. But I,

601
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,950
I do know a lot of dudes that are like
posting pictures of their possessions.

602
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:23,780
They got Instagram. Yeah. And I'm
like, yeah, it makes it like, oh,

603
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:27,350
come on. Like you don't have to do that.
Well that's the, some dudes have to,

604
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,040
but why, what is it, what does that mean?
Well, they don't have to, of course,

605
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:35,420
I don't think it's rappers. It's like
rappers are like, I got this, you know,

606
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:40,310
and the obviously I actually love hip hop,
but that was the lyric. I just want to,

607
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,600
I've got this like I don't,
that's obviously not what
they say, but it's, you know,

608
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,470
it's like a lot of it is like about

609
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,300
about how much your passions
showing your shit off,

610
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:52,860
going on to dub magazine
cover with six cars. And Yeah,

611
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,140
of course that's part of that culture.
So I think that's what,

612
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,490
that's where that comes from. It's
like, it's like attached to you,

613
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:00,040
you just ego and just like alpha.

614
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:05,260
Well it's also a culture that's rebounding
from periods of extreme slow like

615
00:35:05,261 --> 00:35:09,070
slavery, extreme poverty. Like there's
generation after generation of,

616
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:13,150
of negative things. The
racism, the riots, the, the,

617
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:16,000
the civil rights movement.
Like all those things are so recent.

618
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,020
It's hard for us to even wrap our heads.
Oh, it's so recent. It's humiliating.

619
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,620
We're so white to, no, we
don't, we don't feel it.

620
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,910
But I have friends that are half black,
half white. I have friends that are black.

621
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:30,370
I've, I've seen the differences
in how people react to them.

622
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,850
And it's fascinating to watch.
Yeah. You know, like big,

623
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:38,110
dark black dudes gets treated with fear
everywhere they go. It's hilarious. I

624
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,770
that that really is upsetting.
I,

625
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,970
I never really paid that much attention
to it cause like a couple of my best

626
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:46,980
friends growing up were black now.
There were no,

627
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,610
they were black and like I never really
thought about it until like going on

628
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:55,310
auditions because the sign in sheet would
be like for the whatever Susan and I

629
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,490
sign in and then it's like drug dealer
and then it's just like these black guys

630
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,490
are coming in, they're like
signing in. And I'm like, oh man.

631
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:06,030
Like this is just what, what a
society has done. They're like,

632
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,700
this is how we see you. Like these
guys were great actors. It's like, hmm,

633
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,390
someone's got to play the drug dealer.
Wouldn't you want to be a great actor?

634
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,180
You want it to be some real drug
dealer with the fuck you trying to say.

635
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:21,590
You liberal bitch. No. We had this
last season on the show we had a guy,

636
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:22,390
he was a mugger.
Yeah.

637
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,670
And the,

638
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,820
and in the scene it was called skip
therapy and it's a really funny scene.

639
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:29,510
It's like, um, and Kyle done again,
the common cause in it and uh,

640
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,040
and this guy like steals my bag and we
needed it to be a stunt guy. And so, but,

641
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:38,120
but I forgot that. So the guy who
came, he was as great stunt guys names.

642
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:41,450
Actually Muhammad Ali was actually,
it wasn't him, but that's his name.

643
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:46,130
And he came and I was like, I was like, we
cast this black guy as the mugger. Like,

644
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:47,990
are you serious? They were like, no. Like,

645
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:50,180
he's like really great at marsh
lords and stunts and stuff.

646
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,380
The best is when you have a,

647
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,090
a white mug or that doesn't look like
a mugger at all. Yeah. And you're like,

648
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,160
Oh God,
I hate when shows do that.

649
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,180
I felt like there's some shows are,
they're like,

650
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:00,430
the guy steals the purse and you're like,
oh my God,

651
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,440
never has this guy been run before.

652
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,960
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah.

653
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,870
I don't think we could ever even wrap
our heads around what it would be like to

654
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:11,270
be discriminated against solely basic,
you know,

655
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,270
just completely based on the way you
look and to have it feel like that's

656
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,080
insurmountable. And then once you do make
it and you, you know, but you get big.

657
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,390
I could see all the,

658
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,160
the braggadocious behavior
being like exuberant, exuberant.

659
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,730
That's not a word. I made it up
because it sounds good though.

660
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,460
Jubilant exuberant people.
People look at it.

661
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,860
Me, I like just getting onstage, you
know, just like my first, whatever,

662
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,450
like 10 years, I feel like it was
like, it's like, ah, this bitch.

663
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,760
Like I look like I'm
going to be a dumb bitch.

664
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,733
I know.

665
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,690
Like, oh crazy. You do not
look dumb. I look like I'm
going to be a dumb bitch. Yes,

666
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:55,580
I do. You saying dumb bitch meaning
just a woman or you like dumb white.

667
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,580
You think you'd look them?
I think I look like I've,

668
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,350
like if I saw me in like
a mall, I'd be like, Eh.

669
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,360
Oh my God.
That's so funny.

670
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,510
I mean like, well you people have
known who you are for so long,

671
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,250
but do you like how did people like

672
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:21,660
I look like a meathead for sure. Yeah.
I just like past you. I'd be like,

673
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,840
but I have a lot of meathead tendencies.
It's like it's a rational,

674
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:26,740
a prejudiced to think of me as a,

675
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,810
I mean I'm fucking cage fighting
commentator for God's sake and I am a dumb

676
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:35,440
bitch and I'm a dumb bitch too. I
consider myself a silly bitch. But

677
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,570
I mean there's,

678
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,620
but the problem is that we have this idea
that everyone is so different and then

679
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:43,480
these people that are so
different can't be friends.

680
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:47,190
Like I have friends who don't work
on ever. I mean Brian is my friend.

681
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,940
Brian is like just started working out.

682
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:52,840
I feel like for years he just started
working out and smokes cigarettes

683
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:57,520
constantly. It's totally unhealthy. I
mean just stops. Like he's not like,

684
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,130
well my point is like I'm not like a,

685
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,770
it's not like I can't hang out with
other people that don't fucking live.

686
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,060
Would you like to watch fighting? Like,
I don't, my friends are all different

687
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,660
that, I mean like I know you're in shape
and whatever, but that's not, well,

688
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:12,140
but I mean I've also spoken to you,

689
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,730
but I don't know if I
just like walk past you.

690
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,950
I don't, I think it's just, it's
easy to pigeonhole people. Yeah.

691
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:20,040
And I think there's a lot of us that are
a combination of things and that's the

692
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:23,280
people who have been most fascinating to
me when I meet someone and I think that

693
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:26,490
they're, you know, I prejudge for
whatever reason and think, oh,

694
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,690
this person's probably this.

695
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:30,360
And then it turns out that they're like
a combination of things that I've never

696
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,820
even met before. Yeah.
Those are the greatest.

697
00:39:32,821 --> 00:39:36,060
When you meet someone that doesn't fall
in any category. Yeah. And you get to go,

698
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,130
oh,
I have misconceptions.

699
00:39:38,131 --> 00:39:41,700
And then like this person is just a
unique individual completely on their own

700
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:43,380
little trip and cool to see.

701
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,650
And then the APP that runs in your
database and now your spectrum sort of

702
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,090
broadens a little bit your ideas.

703
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,730
That's one of the things that I think
one of the reasons why people get in like

704
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,800
so many shit relationships because
their spectrum is like super narrow.

705
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,660
They've only had like a narrow band of
people and the type of experiences have

706
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:03,330
been like really similar and
negative over and over again.

707
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,960
But other than it just being a
specific like type, you know,

708
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,000
socioeconomic,
that kind of stuff.

709
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,840
Don't you think it's just like those
patterns that were set up just real early

710
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:15,700
on just from your young shit?

711
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,340
It definitely can be for sure.

712
00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:21,210
You also get it from your
parents I think plus and minus.

713
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,110
I think some people see their parents
involved and like really negative

714
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:29,640
relationships and they completely changed
their gears and they just reject it

715
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,850
like from the jump and then they don't
take any shit from anybody that all

716
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:37,010
anybody fucking turn them into
a doormat. Totally. Either or.

717
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,880
It's either or sometimes.

718
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,920
Yeah. Yeah. I do that. I do the, um,

719
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,340
I do the former. Yeah, of course.
That's where your calm, oh my God,

720
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,510
you can't give me the love I need and
you're a narcissist. I'm like, come here,

721
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,240
come here. I'm like, yeah, comics.

722
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,900
That's part of the whole reason why I
became comics is because we had a whole,

723
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,270
yeah,

724
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:02,200
who were trying to shove some funny in
their stuff up that hole and anybody who

725
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:05,770
doesn't have that whole guess what?
You're not funny.

726
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,070
Yeah. I just get you just get a
Harris fact that you did that.

727
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,560
Yeah. I think it was only 46 to give
them more credit than he's doing.

728
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,950
I mean anybody can do 46 oh my
God. Yeah. I think you can't,

729
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,810
you can't be a comic
unless you're on balance,

730
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,810
but I think somewhere along
the line you can be balanced.

731
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:30,040
At least I like to believe so that you
can balance it out. Yeah, you can. Right.

732
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:32,170
The ship just got to
figure out like what is,

733
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,380
what are your like as far as like your
psychological needs and how do you meet

734
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:41,270
those? How do you, how do you maintain a
good psychological existence? Like, yeah.

735
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:45,200
I feel like I'm getting healthier. Yeah.
I hope I feel like that because yeah,

736
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,060
you're more successful so
you're more relaxed too.

737
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:48,430
That's got a benefit you a bit.

738
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,110
Um, I'm, I am more relaxed but
I don't, but it's just, yeah,

739
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:56,560
I'm just like less stressed by some
things but I am having like sort of more

740
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:59,880
pressure on me. But I think it's
just like showbiz pressure. Yeah.

741
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,100
I think it's just like taking a step
back and keeping the people close to you

742
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:06,160
that will tell you like that was
stupid or like you like dog shit.

743
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,540
Just people who keep it real. So
I have like people I trust. Um,

744
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,290
and you keep it real

745
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,770
for yourself too. I mean you can tell
you you're constantly questioning things.

746
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:16,910
And do you worry about that though?

747
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,260
Because that is an issue
with a lot of people.

748
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,250
People worry about becoming famous and
awesome going cuckoo cause we've kind of

749
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:22,710
seen it Nina.

750
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,700
Yeah, definitely. I
I've I I do worry about,

751
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:30,780
cause I you get so like
every day I feel like you,

752
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,880
somebody like slaps you in the face.
I,

753
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:36,600
the way I started going out on the road
was on the last comic standing tour and

754
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:39,150
we have to do meet and
greets after every show.

755
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,820
And sometimes it was like an
arena would be like 3000 people,

756
00:42:41,821 --> 00:42:44,520
however many you would wait
and they voted for some people.

757
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:47,760
So some would come over to me and be
like, my husband likes you, but I know.

758
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:52,560
So I just like got used to and it was
like 40 cities or something and I just got

759
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:56,610
used like this defense. It's just
like built into me now. So I'm like,

760
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,880
I've been like trying to break down,
forget it. My childhood insecurities,

761
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:02,640
like what happened is the first
times I went out on the road,

762
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:07,980
so I'm afraid of my defense has got so
built up that I had to really like break

763
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:11,880
them down so that I could
sort of let the right ones in.

764
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,410
But I am afraid that my defense is,

765
00:43:13,411 --> 00:43:16,230
we'll get too strong because you'll see
like really famous people that are like,

766
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,490
your idols are comics you love and you
meet them and they're so disappointing

767
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,640
because there's so withholding
and it's like you're like, yeah,

768
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:26,850
it's probably because they've been
wronged by so many interactions,

769
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,920
but you still can't
let that happen to you.

770
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,050
And so that is something that I am aware
of and I don't want to let happen to me

771
00:43:34,051 --> 00:43:37,200
because I am, I am like,
you know, afraid of,

772
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,800
of somebody saying something or like
hurting. You're trying to take too much.

773
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,600
And you know what I think about
it with Louis, Louis C K when I,

774
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,660
when I first was interacting with him,

775
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,410
he was like kind of
standoffish with me and uh,

776
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:57,750
and he should have been because I'm sure,
I'm sure I wanted something from him.

777
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,450
You know,
just being a newer comic,

778
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,990
you see someone and you know what the
clubs like, they like, there's like,

779
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:07,530
you just have this urgency as a comic,
like, and you don't know what to do.

780
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:11,280
And like no one can tell you this
is what you do to be a better comic.

781
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,410
This is what you do to get work.
Even if they tell you,

782
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,780
just get on stage as much as possible,
you really can't hear it.

783
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,590
So Louie being so like sort of
guard with me, he should have been.

784
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:22,710
And now like we've a very nice rapport
and it's always good to see him.

785
00:44:22,711 --> 00:44:26,580
And we talk and I, and I kind of like
resented him a little bit for being,

786
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,070
being cold to me at first,
but I'm like, I'm like,

787
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:32,370
he should have been because I'm sure
I even know what I wanted from him,

788
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:35,400
but I'm sure I wanted something
from him so I get it. But,

789
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,480
but also like you were saying before on
the air, like just, you know, somebody,

790
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,780
people will project stuff onto you if
they have like an interaction that's less

791
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:45,210
than satisfactory,
but it's not about you.

792
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:49,170
Like you can't change
anybody feels about you. So,

793
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:51,780
but whenever my long rant,
my point is just like,

794
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,130
I'm trying not to become an asshole and
to give people the benefit of the doubt,

795
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:59,010
at least like I'll go into
every interaction like hi.

796
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,960
And then if they say something to me that
shuts me down, then that's, you know,

797
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,880
I at least I went into it open.
Right.

798
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,850
I feel what you're saying.

799
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,950
And I think that that concern
is a good thing to have.

800
00:45:11,951 --> 00:45:16,570
And it's cool that you're thinking like
that because we all need to learn from

801
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:19,740
the people that we've seen that
have disappointed us. Yeah. Yeah.

802
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,100
People that we've seen that,
you know,

803
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:24,790
just for whatever reason someone became
a prep because of camp famous. Yeah.

804
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,640
That's how I've been to a lot of
comedians. I've seen it, I've seen it.

805
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,640
And they stopped being funny too.
There's another weird thing that happens.

806
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:34,870
They get a little too famous, too
much adulation, too much. You know,

807
00:45:34,871 --> 00:45:36,930
they have a sitcom or something
like that and then, okay.

808
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,800
Or they want, they want credit for like
their new art. They're doing like, look,

809
00:45:41,801 --> 00:45:43,300
I know I was funny at one point,

810
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:47,500
but now I play the standing base
and like if you want to come see me,

811
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,010
that's what you're going to get. And
it's like, who does that? Well, I'm not,

812
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:56,330
I mean like it's not the standing base,
but I'm just saying, I think, cause I,

813
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,300
I even will have those impulses. Like,
I don't want to be funny right now just,

814
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:05,290
and you know, but you're like,
but then I'm like, bitch,
that's how people know you.

815
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:10,330
But wait, why don't you need a
podcast? That's what you need.

816
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,080
You always say that to me. Humor. You
need a God damn podcast because you can,

817
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,840
first of all, you really good at it.
You're very smart, very articulate.

818
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,420
You'd be fats and fascinating
and breaking things down,

819
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,500
but all those misconceptions would go
away. If people got to listen to you talk,

820
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,040
then you wouldn't worry about if people
knew you because you would have put it

821
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:29,860
out there. So many times there
would be like real clear,

822
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,990
but I'm not that worried about
if people know me. Right. But,

823
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,930
well, okay, I see your point. But you're
not really worried that people know you,

824
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:41,990
but your interactions,

825
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,240
like you're worried about
your interactions with people.

826
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,260
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

827
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,300
Okay. You just want to make sure
that they're as good as possible.

828
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,720
I want to like know that I did my
best and that I was open having a nice

829
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:58,370
interaction and, and, and making
small talk and whatever. Um,

830
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,910
uh, I don't, I don't know.

831
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,290
We know we're talking about like you,

832
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:05,550
you were saying you worry
about getting detached,

833
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:08,730
you worry about becoming one of those
people that's kind of, it gets goofy. Yes.

834
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,300
Running the podcast. Do you
like grounded? Oh, 100%.

835
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,510
Cause you get feedback all the time.
You're constantly get updated and check.

836
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:17,240
So you kind of,

837
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,630
I don't, but, but what, what, what's
the feedback good for? I mean,

838
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:22,130
and I'm on Twitter.
I'm sorry.

839
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:26,300
I know I'm on Twitter and I do think
you're right though. But, but then I like,

840
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,740
I don't think it's good to reinforce
pause. I'm negative feedback.

841
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:31,960
Like someone will, you
know, right. You know,

842
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:34,750
like you're disgusting and
then you look and it's like,

843
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,020
oh they write to famous people all day.
You just block them.

844
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,970
You don't have to wait. You
just block them. I just like,

845
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:42,520
I would never reward like that.

846
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,510
Well you don't, that's the
one to you about, I mean,

847
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:48,530
sometimes people will have valid opinions
about what you're doing stand up or

848
00:47:48,531 --> 00:47:51,920
whether it's a podcast or whether it's
like the fucking upright tube or whatever

849
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:55,200
you do. Everybody, whatever.

850
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:00,110
It is every really funny everybody has,
you know, they're going to have opinions.

851
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,070
You're going to have opinions
and everything you do. Yeah.

852
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:06,290
Some sometimes having a those opinions,
like if,

853
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,320
if they're mostly swinging
to the right side, yeah.

854
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,760
They're mostly swing to the good side.

855
00:48:10,761 --> 00:48:13,490
It gives you sort of a frequency
that you're, you, you know,

856
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:15,830
that they appreciate it.
You can do like tapped into this thing.

857
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:19,730
Like people love the Amy
Schumer show, boom, inside
Amy Schumer on comedy central.

858
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:24,110
Now Amy has a blog, you know, hey, watch
Amy do videos. I'm going to go do laundry.

859
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,930
You know, like you, you're,

860
00:48:26,931 --> 00:48:31,710
you tap into your tap into,
uh, a certain vibe when you,

861
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:33,320
you get a certain amount of feedback.

862
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:38,280
Yeah. I, and I feel like
as a comic, you know,

863
00:48:38,281 --> 00:48:41,610
there's that urge to communicate,
which I have.

864
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,760
But then there's also,
I think also as a girl,

865
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,410
as a bunch six and I and I talk like very
openly and then some of that feedback

866
00:48:49,411 --> 00:48:53,370
it makes you like, oh, should I not be
sharing this much of myself because,

867
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,050
but then you're like, I'm like, no,

868
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:59,550
I've made a decision like I'm gonna
live my life this way and try and make

869
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:02,490
people laugh and maybe feel better.
Right.

870
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:06,840
But then like that sometimes that's met
with where you're like, is it worth it?

871
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:09,090
Cause this is so hard sometimes and,

872
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,790
and I'm not just like scared of
somebody saying something mean to me.

873
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:15,820
Like it's also people not respecting your
boundaries and, and it is, you know, it,

874
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,600
it's, it's like a struggle
and it is like, you know, I,

875
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:24,601
I do have to like kind of work and
be aware of not becoming like real

876
00:49:25,231 --> 00:49:26,064
standoffish.

877
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,521
Well you're,

878
00:49:27,521 --> 00:49:32,521
you're not really capable of filtering
who knows you once you become famous.

879
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,860
And that's a big difference between that
and just being an ordinary person going

880
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:41,890
about your day, especially an
ordinary woman going about your day.

881
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,760
Because so many men,
like with women,

882
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,840
take on an aggressive approach.
It's almost like it's,

883
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:52,060
it's almost commonplace,
right?

884
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,970
The guy just aggressively comes
up to girls and hits on them.

885
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,120
Women are just as aggressive,
I find sometimes,

886
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:01,750
but it doesn't come with the physical
threat. Oh, this feels like with a man,

887
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,450
right? Like if a chick's aggressive
with me, I'm always like, oh, okay,

888
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:08,240
it's a crazy bitch. I gotta
get Outta here. Yeah. But I
don't, I'll go, oh my God,

889
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,180
that what if she follows me into my car.

890
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:15,070
That is true. There is, there is
the added fun bonus of like, Oh,

891
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:16,390
this guy might try it.

892
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,430
I try to rape you. Yeah. I mean,

893
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:22,450
that's less fearful when you're a man.
I mean,

894
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:24,040
you're always could worry about
someone doing something to you.

895
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,920
Be honest with you. It's a real
bummer to know that you could be

896
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,600
sexually assaulted. I couldn't
even, I mean I can imagine,
but I couldn't, you know,

897
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:35,500
it's like I couldn't imagine.
I also couldn't imagine being pregnant.

898
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,800
It was a lot of things I could pretend
to imagine, but I really can't imagine.

899
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,760
I can't imagine not
drinking for nine months.

900
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,070
That's my Eddie Izzard marathon.
I'm like,

901
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:53,570
I have a couple of people drank
while they were pregnant for a year.

902
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,100
Some of the greatest people that were
ever created were created by people who

903
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,350
always says that she drank
through all four pregnancies.

904
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:04,460
What things you're allowed
to have a little wine.

905
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:08,990
I think like a small glass of wine is
actually good for your body and it relaxes

906
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:12,500
you and then I would be like,

907
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,910
if he wants to give a fuck,

908
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,740
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

909
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,890
I bet you're not fun when the black
athletes, when you're doing that show

910
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:33,110
escort,
you'll have twins before you even know

911
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,210
if a year from now he come back
and I'm like, you've got twins.

912
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,860
I've got little half black babies.

913
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,900
Like the crazy thing is all
I did was check him off.

914
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,330
He came over and like to to the next
thing. I know I was pregnant. I mean,

915
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,060
I don't want kids. I take you to
court for alimony. They fucking right.

916
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,470
You don't need any money. They ran
through the lines in your crotch like,

917
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,010
like fire ants

918
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:06,050
move. They swim, they swim on land.

919
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:10,940
The fucking flopping around it. Yeah.
You're flopping around like those fish,

920
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:14,960
those snake fish that come out with those
snakehead fish that come out of water

921
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:18,890
and they walk on the land until they
find some new water or solar from the

922
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,100
Little Mermaid. No, a real fish. God
dammit. If you've ever seen that.

923
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:22,934
I saw the movie

924
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,810
is going to be three D so I was like so
psyched when they gave us the glasses,

925
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:32,630
I was like, what? It was like one of
the best surprises in my whole life.

926
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,860
I used to have Paranas allegedly.
Yeah. I had a bunch of them.

927
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,510
I used to feed them goldfish
allegedly. This is all fiction. Yes.

928
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,430
Many decades ago
when it was legal.

929
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,290
Yeah. The, that you could send
them into if you are an asshole,

930
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:54,380
you could put them in a lake somewhere
and they'd go in the non native waters

931
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:55,430
and they would wreck havoc.

932
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,100
And that's happened to a bunch
of different fish species.

933
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,820
Think this snake head was one of them.
Actually. Uh, if it's not the state kid,

934
00:53:01,821 --> 00:53:05,060
it's different fish.
There's a walking fish is that it

935
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,350
invades in New York City
people through them.

936
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:14,620
Some people through these fish in the
pond that's in central park as cause they

937
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:15,704
thought it was funny.

938
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,450
And so now these things are living in
the pond and just destroying everything.

939
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:25,000
When I was there, I saw some
fish, some big giant fish attack,

940
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,440
something else in the water just to speak,
froth of water.

941
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,630
And then whatever it
happened, you know, happened.

942
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:33,650
It was like probably there's a
pond in central park, you know,

943
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,860
got a big pond in that water.
There's some crazy ass fish.

944
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,670
So this is, yeah, Monster Fish
in central park. Does it attack,

945
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,710
attack anything or can you just
see it? Oh, that's it right there.

946
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:51,540
He barely could see it. Yeah,
that's a snake. Snakehead fish.

947
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,780
Those things. He ducks, they'll
eat anything. Oh my God. They're,

948
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,660
they're like super hardy to like you.
Once you get them in an ecosystem,

949
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:04,230
you have to essentially kill everything
in that lake to get them all out.

950
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:09,000
What did they do? They just traffic, eat
everything and then become cannibals.

951
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,450
It says, if you see this
fish, it's like this,

952
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:17,550
see a terrifying fish with teeth and
central park. Kill it immediately.

953
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,063
It's too late.

954
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,670
The problem is these things are just
shooting out eggs and sperm and breeding

955
00:54:23,671 --> 00:54:27,150
like crazy. This is like Predator,
like remember that movie Predator?

956
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,420
Like if Predator landed and just
started killing all the people,

957
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,950
that's what it's like for that thing.

958
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,330
Like that thing going into the pond
in central park. It's like, Woo,

959
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,530
let the party begin.
Such a bummer is there's a lion's.

960
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,210
A lion just got led into the fucking zebra
cage. The zoo. That's what it's like.

961
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:42,961
Oh.
I was like,

962
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:46,260
that happened or could happen and
that's what's happening with this fish.

963
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,520
It's just that's what it's like.

964
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,330
A Super Predator just got introduced
until this humble ecosystem.

965
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,220
We're about to film on that you might
watch murder behind you fish murder.

966
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,353
But the um,

967
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,920
the fish is like the worst thing you
could ever see for a creationist.

968
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:08,580
The fish walking on the ground
and walking to the next pond.

969
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,090
Cause if you're a creationist
and you see that you go away.

970
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,270
I mean don't creationists do that
all day looking at everything? Yes,

971
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,710
with denial. But this is one of
the most preposterous things ever.

972
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:24,810
Have you ever seen? You've never
seen one of these things walk? No,

973
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:28,450
I'm so grossed out and come here.

974
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,950
I leave upset because of the videos.
There's a documented from the Congo.

975
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,170
He got fucked by the horse that show that

976
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,890
outcome.
This is nothing nearly as disturbing.

977
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:45,720
But there's a video in the Congo where
I think it's prehistoric fish eaten by

978
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:48,150
dinosaur bird.
That's what it says.

979
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:53,210
There's this crazy bird called a shoe
bill and the shoe bill is like five feet

980
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:56,880
tall with an enormous beak.

981
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,870
It's beak is like a giant hatchet.
Yeah. It's beaches like he's,

982
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,710
it's beak rather is literally like
an ax on its face. It's huge beak.

983
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,730
And this bird is something
out of another era.

984
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,620
Like they used to be birds like that,

985
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:14,220
that like seven feet tall that lived
in North America and they don't fly.

986
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,970
They just sort of run around and
attack things and the predatory birds.

987
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:21,700
And why is it a bird like a penguin?
Penguins don't fly. You look,

988
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,980
we're birds were birds.
Bitch do not fuck

989
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,490
with us.

990
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,570
Did you see that dinosaur three d movie
that's available right now on Netflix?

991
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:32,320
I did not say, oh it's really good.
It's my first time. No it's not.

992
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,020
It's not animated and there
aren't that many dinosaurs in it,

993
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:39,340
but it's really worth it. Yeah.
This is not the dinosaur movie.

994
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,890
Donald Sutherland,
that's the dad.

995
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,970
He narrates it and it's like,
it's really good.

996
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,010
I obviously am psyched by three days.

997
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,690
Oh, so it's, it's a recreation of
like what they looked like. Yeah.

998
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,770
And they like got her
and dress her hairstyle.

999
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:58,350
Yeah. And it ends like spoiler
with a big, it's not a pterodactyl,

1000
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,490
but it kinda looks like an ostrich.

1001
00:56:59,491 --> 00:57:03,930
Like it just looks like some sort of
like prehistoric sort of evolving bird.

1002
00:57:03,931 --> 00:57:06,480
That's like so awesome.
She just another good example of birth,

1003
00:57:06,481 --> 00:57:10,680
it doesn't really fly. Right. They don't
fly. They don't do shit to fuck you up.

1004
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:14,370
They'll kick the shit out of you.
They fuck you did. I saw that video.

1005
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,740
We try to fuck people. I don't, I think
I've talked about this in here before.

1006
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:22,060
I remember being real traumatized by
seeing a guy laying there blindfolded and

1007
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:24,390
he doesn't know what's fucking
him and it's an ostrich.

1008
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:30,490
Well, that's not me. Never saw that. No.
Who would buy the times that happened,

1009
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:32,860
I'd already given up.
I'm watching people get fucked by animals.

1010
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,640
There was a certain time that Joe,
I'll tell you right now, I've done,

1011
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:40,120
it was a certain time a few years
back where if you said, hey,

1012
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:42,810
here's the link of guys getting
fucked by an ostrich egg in on it,

1013
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:46,430
I would click it, but not today.
Today I'd be like, again, whatever.

1014
00:57:46,431 --> 00:57:49,990
I want to call your bluff
so bad you wouldn't call my
bluff because honestly you

1015
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:50,561
don't know where it is.

1016
00:57:50,561 --> 00:57:54,940
I don't know if it was
something absolutely fantastic
where no one had ever seen

1017
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,190
anything like it before.
Yeah. Then I'll click on it,

1018
00:57:57,191 --> 00:58:01,210
but I don't watch some dude
get fucked by animal done pass.

1019
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,550
D u m the done.

1020
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:06,920
Don't even try it.

1021
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,770
You something like that starts up fucking
pinwheel and your head starts spinning

1022
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:15,160
around. I have this guy here, we get to
that point. What did he start out as?

1023
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:17,650
He used to be a baby one time.
What did his parents do to him?

1024
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:21,930
Actually that's me watching any porn.
Well that's a problem.

1025
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,830
I mean I'll power through it,
but still,

1026
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,370
well I always looking at it and go out
and yeah, I'm going to fix them now. Yeah.

1027
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:33,290
Two lessees with some Dick. God
has a plan. Yeah, you can't, um,

1028
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,760
you can't fix them unfortunately.
But that is exactly how you should feel.

1029
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:40,510
If you're a sort of a humane person.
Thank you. See them and you go, oh,

1030
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:44,950
this poor people. Probably the victim. You
don't call them them. These poor people.

1031
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:49,650
Yeah. These, can Paul call them these
poor people, those people, you know, um,

1032
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,870
uh, for money. Give a fuck for money.

1033
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:56,250
It's a weird thing that everybody
watches that, but nobody, uh,

1034
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,800
nobody admits to it.

1035
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,160
I will admit to the don't like to admit
to porn on it. That really watching it.

1036
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:07,580
Yeah. I don't know anyone in my life that
doesn't, that doesn't watch porn. Wow.

1037
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:11,090
Are you hanging out with different people
than me? Really? Well, I don't know.

1038
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:15,820
It's a single dude who doesn't
watch porn girls, you know,

1039
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,360
a lot of girls watch porn. All my friends
watch porn. Friends are all freaks.

1040
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,980
But you know, know when I
was younger I was like, I

1041
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,280
was, I did not like porn, like at
all. I remember I had a boyfriend,

1042
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:28,190
I was like 23 or four, and I was
like, I thought it was like cheating.

1043
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,610
And then I grew up and then you're
like, oh wait, this is awesome.

1044
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,970
For a lot of guys,
23 is when that's the age cutoff.

1045
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,250
So they don't get to
that new mature woman.

1046
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:42,170
They just find another girls
and your porn. Oh, no, I really,

1047
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:45,890
I know, I really like it. I have friends
that are like that though. Let me get,

1048
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,390
the one girl gets to like 23 they
completely lose interest and they move on.

1049
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,000
Again,
they're called Comedians,

1050
00:59:56,001 --> 01:00:00,140
but I think that grill comedians are
probably just completely different animal.

1051
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,270
I guess if I had to guess.
I don't know.

1052
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:12,290
I don't even think so. I don't think so.
I don't think I'm any wilder or crazier.

1053
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:15,190
I think I'm probably like pretty boring.
But I,

1054
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,150
you know like having sex,
like,

1055
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,800
yeah, there's nothing wrong with
saying that on the radio or a podcast.

1056
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:25,610
I don't know why. It's like, so why is
that a thing? I mean it's everybody.

1057
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:28,760
It feels good. Like why is it,
it's okay to say you like massages.

1058
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:33,180
People always ask me like in, you
know, like local press, they were like,

1059
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:35,130
why do you talk about sex so much?
I'm like,

1060
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,900
it's the most interesting thing
we do is people I think like,

1061
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:44,700
why wouldn't I want to talk about, I think
it's like really funny. Why? You know?

1062
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:47,130
And it's not that I think.

1063
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,240
I think I'm probably having a like pretty
mundane sex compared to everybody else.

1064
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,870
I'm pretty basic but just like that,

1065
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,940
just hearing a girl like mention it just
kind of makes people like why I don't,

1066
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:04,920
this is just judging by
doing like local press,

1067
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,241
right?

1068
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:08,930
Well you got to think about different
peoples look the jobs they have and the

1069
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,680
amount of restraint that's required to
keep a job at an office where you're not

1070
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:15,780
allowed to talk about anything
freaky for like eight hours a day.

1071
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,830
I haven't had like an
office even before stand up.

1072
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:22,430
I was just like bartending like are
you should fear but you're a woman,

1073
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,180
you're a comic,
you know your,

1074
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,340
your perceptions like why they
would be upset at you for,

1075
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:32,600
for talking about sex or
liking sex because to them
it's like a mindblower like

1076
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:36,180
she talks about sex all the time.
She just talks about like,

1077
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:38,180
but it's not that I'm like,
oh my God,

1078
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,130
I can't believe there's not
something in my body right now.

1079
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:44,930
I feel like I have a totally normal
sexual appetite. Totally normal.

1080
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:47,300
I think I probably watched
porn like twice a week.

1081
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,080
The controversy is just talking about it,
talking about a sexual appetite at all.

1082
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,100
That's the controversy.

1083
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:56,510
I think even I just, you know, did some,

1084
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:00,220
some shows on NPR and like they're,
they,

1085
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:04,820
they've never experienced penetration
before. Like Sara Silverman,

1086
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:08,720
when she did the ted talk
and they completely censored
or they pulled it down.

1087
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:13,020
But that was about like a
kid being retarded. Right.

1088
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:16,250
The Ted talk was,
I thought it was her act.

1089
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:20,080
I thought it was like the joke and I'm, I
don't remember what the, let's find out.

1090
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,960
We should find out since we're
talking about it. Sarah Silverman.

1091
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:25,710
Ted taught called, yeah, I don't think
it was sexual. I think it was. Okay.

1092
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:30,670
She's so sexual.
I don't think of Syrah is super sexual.

1093
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,690
Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Her
Act. It's very sexual. It's very dirty.

1094
01:02:34,691 --> 01:02:37,140
It's hilarious. She's hilarious. Right?

1095
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:41,380
Ted Versus Sarah Silverman
fight turns really retarded.

1096
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,680
Okay. Uh, known for her shock and insult.

1097
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:51,910
Humor was invited to give a Ted talk.
She subsequently trashed Ted Organizer,

1098
01:02:51,911 --> 01:02:54,040
Chris Andrew Anderson,
who tweeted,

1099
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,130
I know I shouldn't say this
about one of my own speakers,

1100
01:02:57,131 --> 01:03:01,510
but I thought Sarah Silverman was God
awful. He wrote that and he's a bitch.

1101
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,080
I'm real.

1102
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:07,080
The problem was that Silverman kept
using the word retarded to fight Sarah

1103
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:09,940
Palin's recent rant about the word.

1104
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:13,630
The whole talk flew
right over the ted crowd.

1105
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:18,310
So wow. That is hilarious.
Anderson deleted his tweet,

1106
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:21,940
but silver men hit back today with
our own saying that Kudos to Ted,

1107
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:24,070
Chris for moving Ted,

1108
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:29,200
an unsafe for making Ted and
unsafe haven for all your,

1109
01:03:29,201 --> 01:03:33,400
a barnacle of mediocrity. Bill
Gates, asshole. That's awesome.

1110
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,740
Oh my God. She crushed him. Yeah.

1111
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:39,720
You're a barnacle of mediocrity
on Bill Gates' ass hole.

1112
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:44,980
So good. Oh my God. That is beautiful.
That's Shakespeare. Oh my God.

1113
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:45,940
That's so funny.
Yeah.

1114
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:50,500
And then Steve Case weighted in AOL
founder Steve Case waded into the fight to

1115
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:54,280
defend Anderson. He tweeted,
shame on you to Silverman adding.

1116
01:03:54,281 --> 01:03:58,690
The sad thing is you're not
that funny. Uh, you lose,

1117
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,070
you lose this. We're staying
in that stupid. It's sadness.
Shame on you. You lose.

1118
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,440
Unless you bring silly,
right? There you is.

1119
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,810
Like if you say something to me and I say,
shame on you,

1120
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:12,220
shame on you Amy Schumer or how dare
you, Amy Schumer. That's, I'm joking.

1121
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:16,060
This guy is shame on you for real.
So when you say shame on you for real,

1122
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,490
you're out, you lose, you're
out of the game's over.

1123
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:22,480
The sad thing is you're not
that funny. Oh No. What? Okay.

1124
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,230
You explained to me the whole Barnacle
on Bill Gates asshole line then.

1125
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,440
Cause that shit is hilarious.
Line the fuck Outta here.

1126
01:04:29,441 --> 01:04:33,910
You know why that's not funny?
And Silverman's response was,

1127
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,990
you should be nicer to the last
person on earth with an AOL account.

1128
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,710
She got him to boom bitch,
the fight.

1129
01:04:44,711 --> 01:04:47,590
But she's Silverman in case continued.
But you get the picture. Oh,

1130
01:04:47,591 --> 01:04:49,800
that's beautiful. And good for her. Well,

1131
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:54,280
that happened when they went after
salon.com went after Patton Oswald and he

1132
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:55,610
crushed them.
Uh,

1133
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,150
it's just so arbitrary.
There's just no,

1134
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,420
you have no control over what somebody
picks up on what happens like that.

1135
01:05:01,421 --> 01:05:04,390
I mean, of course if you go on some rant
when you're like saying racist shit,

1136
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:07,800
like that's ridiculous. But, but for
comics it's just, sorry, it's just,

1137
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:11,290
it's just a slow news day and
they're like, this was a problem.

1138
01:05:11,291 --> 01:05:14,050
People just like choose
Norton. Um, after I,

1139
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,770
people were getting really mad at me
about a joke I made about Steevo the sheen

1140
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:18,160
roast

1141
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,610
and Norton, he, uh, he like
stood up for me and was like,

1142
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,660
you're selective outrage.
Steevo or the go died.

1143
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:30,100
The joke was saying that I, that we
all wish that. Yeah, that was a joke.

1144
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:33,880
They made the same joke
about, uh, about Jeraldo with,

1145
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:36,850
with Anthony Jeselnik but it's a comic.

1146
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:40,920
You're allowed to do that comics that was
on the road. Oh, I know. He's a comic.

1147
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:45,460
Well, listen, I'm, I'm with
you. It's one of those things,

1148
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,880
but hey,
with comedy,

1149
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:52,000
it's always who's going to be the first
person to make the hike? You know?

1150
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:56,630
And a lot of times I honestly didn't think
it was going to be like, you does it,

1151
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:58,930
it's like,
it's like good to get an extra impact.

1152
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,810
I honestly didn't think that was
going to be that big of a yikes. Wow.

1153
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,820
I wasn't going for would.
I would definitely,

1154
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:06,280
I wasn't going for the
headline on buzzfeed. I swear.

1155
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:07,710
I would definitely think it would be a,
yeah,

1156
01:06:07,711 --> 01:06:11,050
like I don't know what the
fuck you were thinking, man.

1157
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:16,140
I realize where I was really surprised
because it wasn't a big deal in the room.

1158
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:19,120
It was like we're all hitting hard,
right?

1159
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:21,160
Like I just didn't even think
that was going to be a big deal.

1160
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,720
I just think that's comics.

1161
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:27,610
I'm used to sitting around with those
guys at the cellar and it's fun.

1162
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:30,310
It's,
it's how we communicate.

1163
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:36,170
Tell you half of these guys who
were my best friends grew up, but I,

1164
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:38,710
I'm ready with so many insults for them.

1165
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,760
If one of the mocks back
wearing his stupid jacket,

1166
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:47,290
Norton is awesome with that too.
Oh,

1167
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:53,250
Norton has crushed me so many times and
talked about this funny story where he

1168
01:06:54,731 --> 01:06:55,420
was a,

1169
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:59,140
he had a slice of pizza and Louis C K
saw him on the street and just slapped a

1170
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,240
slice of pizza to the ground.
Called him a faggot

1171
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,890
and he starts laughing when he's
telling the story. I was a juicy pizza.

1172
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:10,190
Pizza too is a nice one.

1173
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:14,950
You couldn't do that to
another person that you know,

1174
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,290
they wouldn't appreciate that.

1175
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:19,570
The humor in the inappropriateness
makes us so happy.

1176
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,730
The other night we were
just playing Keith Robinson.

1177
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,890
When he got eliminated from star search,

1178
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:27,160
we were playing it over and over again
in front of him and by the way, don't,

1179
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:31,120
don't think that you can come to
Amy Schumer's slapper pizza down.

1180
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,140
That's not what we're saying. You have
to be a comedian. You know each other.

1181
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:38,980
You still have a good friend,
but that's so funny.

1182
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:46,150
Did you see a special roadwork
or it's awesome you can get it,

1183
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,660
but it still happy that he's doing
well again. His show looks dope.

1184
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,470
He's fucking hilarious.
Fucking hilarious.

1185
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,630
I don't think there is a funniest guy
alive, but he's one of my favorites,

1186
01:07:55,631 --> 01:07:56,800
that's for sure.
But he,

1187
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:00,460
I was sitting at the table with my rounds
of venture female comics and we were

1188
01:08:00,461 --> 01:08:04,820
all like eating dessert. It was like a
really like sad moment. He just walks up.

1189
01:08:04,821 --> 01:08:07,090
We're like, hey Dave. He's like,
oh, what are you guys having?

1190
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:11,150
No boyfriend olive mode
like

1191
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:17,260
that.
Like Tier Mizu saddest.

1192
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:21,940
Uh Oh, that's so funny.
It's just like, oh boy,

1193
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:24,380
Rick,
hey Dave.

1194
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:28,550
He didn't even see us till he turned and
then just boom fired at us and Canada

1195
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:32,300
just right off the cuff.
Boom.

1196
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:35,080
He's definitely one of the best
joke writers out there. Yeah. Yeah.

1197
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:39,150
He's got so much of his act as jokey
joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, joke.

1198
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,690
You know. So funny. Yeah. He's
hilarious. That skanks for the memories.

1199
01:08:43,691 --> 01:08:48,220
One of my favorite cds ever. So
good. Yeah, it's, it's a nice time.

1200
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,250
Big Comedy Fan. Yeah. Lot of
good comics out there now.

1201
01:08:51,251 --> 01:08:54,700
It's just totally different experience
than it was 20 years ago I think.

1202
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:57,520
I think a lot of it is probably
because of the Internet,

1203
01:08:57,790 --> 01:09:00,910
like more people have an avenue and
this is more demand for common and

1204
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,590
I think just staying at some
comedy condos on the road,

1205
01:09:04,591 --> 01:09:07,980
they'll have like VHS is of old specials.
Yeah.

1206
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:12,550
And a lot of them are pretty shitty. Like,
it'll be like kind of topical and, and,

1207
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,840
and there is that like off the cuff,
like that movie punchline,

1208
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,900
how ahead Sally fields
coming out at the end.

1209
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:21,570
Kind of just like winging it and
like it working out as a comic,

1210
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:25,530
that just set up a whole,
I think wave of people being like,

1211
01:09:25,531 --> 01:09:30,050
maybe I'm amazing at comedy and I don't
know it was, that movie was so bad. Oh,

1212
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,350
the standup of that movie was so,
it was so,

1213
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,120
so obviously not real
stand up. It was like, oh,

1214
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:39,650
they were faking it and the audience
reaction was fake. You can't do that.

1215
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,210
It doesn't work with standup.

1216
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:46,420
Like you can fake being a fucking union
boss and screaming at the fucking people

1217
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:50,000
in the yard. Yeah. But if there's
an artificial feeling to that,

1218
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:55,100
it's not nearly as offensive as the
artificial feeling of watching Tom Hanks

1219
01:09:55,130 --> 01:10:00,020
kill it with nonsense. I was sober at
all. Like, oh, just you're just talking.

1220
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:04,010
You could, yeah. You could see like he
probably could be a comic. He ain't,

1221
01:10:04,011 --> 01:10:08,240
he had good delivery, good setups.
Who's the, who's doing the prior movie?

1222
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:12,300
I Dunno if they cast going to play
right your prior yet. But I was like,

1223
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,620
wasn't it going to be Eddie Griffin
at one point in time? I Dunno,

1224
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:19,580
but I hope it's a comic. It has to be. Uh,
I don't know. I would have to be, I mean,

1225
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:22,260
I would think it would have to,
but even then it's not going to work.

1226
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:26,810
One guy pulled it off ever. What?
Dustin Hoffman, Dustin Hoffman.

1227
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:31,460
You ever see Lenny? No, it's fucking
brilliant. Yeah, it's fucking brilliant.

1228
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:34,050
Yeah. It's fucking, he
like get ready for it.

1229
01:10:34,051 --> 01:10:36,950
But everything did he go on the road are,
and that's a really good question.

1230
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:37,970
I don't know what he did,

1231
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,930
but what he did do when he did the movie
is get Lenny Bruce Down to a fucking t.

1232
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:43,430
Yeah.
It incredible.

1233
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,070
I mean it was one of the best performances
of his career and very few people

1234
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:47,090
know about it.
Yeah.

1235
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:50,780
And very people outside of standups
even know who Lenny Bruce was.

1236
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:54,970
Lenny Bruce or like bill Hicks collects
more, more people know who bill Hicks is.

1237
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,710
Yeah. But Lenny Bruce is just
sort of a name, you know,

1238
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:02,120
I could fucking Sid Caesar, you
know what I mean? All those names.

1239
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:06,530
You don't really ever see the word.
Yeah. Red Buttons. Oh, that guy. Yeah,

1240
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:11,540
I've heard of him. We don't sit around
unless you're like a real cool. Yeah,

1241
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:14,010
I like it. That's something I like
to do on the road is going record

1242
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,800
stores and listen to whatever comedy
albums they had. That's really fun.

1243
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,540
It like, well, first of all
it's like sad that I'm like,

1244
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:25,410
and then I'll do this today when I'm in a
city. Like there's a sadness to it, but,

1245
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:29,220
but that, that sort, and it also keeps
me up because I, I feel bad. Like,

1246
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:32,760
why is that sad? Um, I just think,

1247
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:36,960
I think being stand up such like an
isolating life and so, but I like,

1248
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:39,270
we'll be like,
I'm looking forward to like,

1249
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:41,880
my couple of things I like to do
in cities. I don't know. I think,

1250
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:45,360
I think everything about being a standup,
it's like sad. [inaudible] I think so.

1251
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:50,380
Do you go on the road with other
friends? Um, well I have, um,

1252
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,170
I have Mark Norman,
who's Hilarious,

1253
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:57,171
opens for me or I have my friend Bridget
Everett actually now she like closes

1254
01:11:57,241 --> 01:12:02,070
for me. She's, she's hilarious. She's
a cabaret singer. But she gets naked.

1255
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:06,970
Yeah. No one can follow
her. What does she do? She,

1256
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:10,980
she does Montreal. She does. Um, she
does like, she'll do like the nasty show,

1257
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:14,730
but she'll like have to close it because
she's, it's not stand up. She's a,

1258
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,320
she's a singer.
She's like an amazing singer.

1259
01:12:16,321 --> 01:12:18,160
But she the one who does
with Hannibal Burress show.

1260
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:22,830
She just did Hannibal show with
method man. It's Burress. Yeah.

1261
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:28,740
Keep your hair. I wish, I bet you guys
were fighting together. But yeah, bridges.

1262
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,820
I've seen her. I saw her, he
showed me a video. She's a killer.

1263
01:12:32,821 --> 01:12:36,360
So at first I just like want people
to see her. She does. She's the only,

1264
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,630
like I do stand up on my show
and I'll do like an interview.

1265
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:42,180
And the only time I don't do an
interview as if she's performing,

1266
01:12:42,181 --> 01:12:45,690
she's in a band with ad rock. She's
like such a bad ass, but I was like,

1267
01:12:45,691 --> 01:12:49,890
I just need people to see her,
Bridget Everett. And uh, so,

1268
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:53,130
so she came on the road with me and
I was like, man, she's such a closer.

1269
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:55,530
But then I was like,
I still want her to come out with me.

1270
01:12:55,531 --> 01:12:58,470
So I just like would do an hour and
then I'd be like, that's the show.

1271
01:12:58,471 --> 01:13:01,680
And I have a special guest and
I have her come out because she,

1272
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:05,250
I feel like she changes people's lives
with how these actions is a performer.

1273
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:11,000
You laughed so hard and it just, I dunno,
just like changes and there's, yeah.

1274
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:16,290
Oh my God, that's awesome. And you
buddies in real life likes to go out

1275
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,813
with my friends,

1276
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:24,510
but don't you just have one person open
for you or you can get like, Oh okay,

1277
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,490
that's nice. I've done three before.
I've done three. That'd be really fun.

1278
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:32,280
We just, we got to get on a
bus this time. And it was fun.

1279
01:13:32,281 --> 01:13:35,850
Cause my Mark Norman has been opening
for me and he's, he's hilarious. Like,

1280
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:37,230
but Bridget,
what she does,

1281
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:41,630
she goes out into the crowd like
it's such a physical thing, but um,

1282
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,810
she sits on dudes labs. She,
she'll motor boat. Anybody.

1283
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:49,950
She air her,
her act is so killer.

1284
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,840
Um, but it's been, but it's been
like so cool because um, yeah,

1285
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:57,060
mark started opening for me like four
or five years ago. So the answer's yes.

1286
01:13:57,061 --> 01:14:01,050
You like to go on the road with your
friends as they make it less sad because

1287
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:04,480
you're all just having a good time
together. Yeah, totally. Totally. Yeah.

1288
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:08,830
That doesn't erase the 10 years
with a long time ago early,

1289
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,070
I took a pay cut way
early to do that because

1290
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,670
it's just too, yeah. And I would even get
grief by, they would say, well, you know,

1291
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:18,490
across you this much to fathers first now
and that much to hire him and you know,

1292
01:14:18,491 --> 01:14:20,950
you're making this much less
because I'm like, so what?

1293
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:25,580
Well, no, I got, I got my sister
traveling with me and my brother in law.

1294
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:27,230
Like we have a camp,

1295
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:30,320
we have a little camp and that's why
the road has been really sweet lately.

1296
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,650
That's nice. It's fun. That's
definitely a good thing. Yeah. It also,

1297
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:36,810
I find like I feel funnier when I'm
hanging out with all my friends cause we

1298
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:37,910
were all laughing at each other.
Right.

1299
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,460
And it keeps you down or you're
not going to be like, yeah.

1300
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:42,720
You get what I'm doing.
Um,

1301
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,910
Orlando on Thursday with
Joey Diaz nights or Friday.

1302
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,910
Actually this Friday we leave
Thursday. But what's the, what's the,

1303
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,670
it's going to be some theater, but we're
just going to have so much fun. Yeah.

1304
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,231
I mean it's like,

1305
01:14:54,231 --> 01:14:58,130
I can't imagine not having fun hanging
out with Diaz all day and we're going to

1306
01:14:58,131 --> 01:15:02,510
have a great time. So I feel that all
day. So the road is like home, you know,

1307
01:15:02,511 --> 01:15:04,520
cause Joey's family and
we've been together.

1308
01:15:04,521 --> 01:15:06,950
We've been friends for
fucking forever now.

1309
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,460
Longevity.
Yeah.

1310
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,910
Joey will go to the gym and tell me
about it's fucking Jujitsu class.

1311
01:15:13,911 --> 01:15:17,780
Joey's going. Did you just do now
really kettlebell swings and shit? No,

1312
01:15:17,781 --> 01:15:22,190
he's just doing try and be healthy. Yeah.
Do a little exercise. That's awesome.

1313
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,140
Yeah. He's uh, he's the most fun.

1314
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,600
Yeah.
We have fun on the road.

1315
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:29,800
The first time I did Orlando mark when
Mark Open for me and we stayed at this

1316
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:34,270
hotel and it had a water slide.
Yeah. I was like Oh my God. And,

1317
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:37,360
and it made me go do that club again
cause I was like well they've got that

1318
01:15:37,361 --> 01:15:38,440
waterside at that hotel

1319
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:38,931
dude.

1320
01:15:38,931 --> 01:15:42,750
Waterslide there was a place in Phoenix
we used to do the Tempe Improv that her

1321
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,830
water slide.
It was fucking awesome.

1322
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:48,610
Yes. In comics, you know you're
getting, you're like, Oh God,

1323
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:50,440
that club was super weird.
But the hotels good.

1324
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:52,870
Like they do a free hour of drinks during,
okay.

1325
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:58,180
You know what else has a water slide
is the hard rock in Florida at Florida,

1326
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,170
Hollywood, Florida that me and Tate,
my friend Tate, we went that way.

1327
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,430
We had to like a couple hours to kill
before our flight and we found out about

1328
01:16:05,431 --> 01:16:08,320
the water slide. The inner tube. Fuck Yo,

1329
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,370
we wire slide if like two hours
before we had to leave. Oh yeah.

1330
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,950
It was so much fun.
There were tunnels and shit.

1331
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,200
You go shooting out the bottom
of the tunnel. Yeah. Good.

1332
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:20,230
We were there the second time we went
back and there was a family and I guess

1333
01:16:20,231 --> 01:16:24,250
they were Muslim. They were
wearing burkinis. Oh my God.

1334
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:29,350
Do you know this? That's real. Yeah. They
were all, all the girls were in Burkina.

1335
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:34,180
It just, yeah, a bikini, but
it's a burka. Okay. Waterproof.

1336
01:16:34,181 --> 01:16:38,440
So that face is covered or their
whole bodies covered. It was there,

1337
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:42,960
their eyes were out or their fees and
everything else was covered. Jamie,

1338
01:16:42,961 --> 01:16:47,620
pull up Burkini, Jesus Christ.
See this. That can't be real.

1339
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:51,870
Yeah. And I was like, man, I want
that. Like why can't she just crying?

1340
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,830
I would have gotten on the
waterside 10 more times and that,

1341
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:58,120
that really literally freaks me out.
The chick look, so first of all,

1342
01:16:58,121 --> 01:17:01,060
the chick does not look like the people
that were at the water park with us,

1343
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,440
but that freaks me. [inaudible]
name is like, Kelly, come on,

1344
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:10,160
let's get this same Burkini.
That insane.

1345
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,780
It's just,
it's insane that they look so happy,

1346
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:17,090
but you're being cute.

1347
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,910
But it's that culture,

1348
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:25,690
like it forces that that's one of the
most insane things in 2014 that's it.

1349
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:31,220
I mean, isn't that just fear?
I guess it's also a pattern.

1350
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:36,220
It's a religious pattern. That religious
pattern, one of the left POW POW, pow.

1351
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:39,180
The one of the right now all know

1352
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,630
Jesus creating,
fixing that poor girl.

1353
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:49,520
I went to Dubai once, her standup and
it was a real bummer. It's a bummer.

1354
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,090
It's a bummer seeing people and you know
they don't think it's a bummer cause

1355
01:17:53,091 --> 01:17:55,010
they're used to it.
It's a bummer for you though.

1356
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:57,740
If you have freedom to dress however
you want and you see something like that

1357
01:17:57,741 --> 01:18:00,320
and you just go, what's
going on? Why don't we,

1358
01:18:00,321 --> 01:18:03,770
the women like how come the men can wear
shorts and you could wear whatever the

1359
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:07,100
fuck you want. Like the lion.
Can they though? I don't know.

1360
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:11,990
I mean a lot love the men were religious
garbs as well. There could do what ever.

1361
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,720
Whatever they want. Let ever, even some
of the comics I was working with was like,

1362
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:17,870
some of them could say things
and some of them couldn't.

1363
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:22,040
I feel terrible whenever I
see any form of suppression.

1364
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:27,150
So when I see that that was the worst
thing was seeing the way that they dealt

1365
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:29,900
with like the Filipino waitstaff,
just the people,

1366
01:18:29,901 --> 01:18:31,310
because it's such a caste system there.

1367
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:36,340
It's like forget about the women being
that shield that it was like that was,

1368
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:40,520
that was a bummer.
Well have you ever seen,

1369
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,840
there was pieces that were done on some
unscrupulous employees or employers

1370
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,910
rather that we're taking these
people from other countries.

1371
01:18:49,911 --> 01:18:51,860
They were getting them from like a,

1372
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:55,970
a guy who'd be like a wrangler and he
would go to these other countries and tell

1373
01:18:55,971 --> 01:18:58,730
these people that they were going to
get a lot of money and tell these people

1374
01:18:58,731 --> 01:18:59,960
that all these good things
are going to happen.

1375
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:04,700
And then he would bring them over here
to start working for these companies and

1376
01:19:04,701 --> 01:19:07,490
then they would take their
passports away and leave them.

1377
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:10,680
These like subhuman conditions
is horrible conditions.

1378
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:14,990
Sleeping like head to toe in a room with
22 dirt floors and holes in the ground

1379
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:18,500
to shit in like vice did a piece on them
and you're like, this is incredible.

1380
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:20,830
I mean,
it's not all establishments there,

1381
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:25,830
but the fact that it does happen and
that the way it's set up, you know the,

1382
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,740
I don't know who's responsible.

1383
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:30,470
I don't know if it's the people at the
top where the people at the bottom that

1384
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:31,340
are hiring these people,

1385
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:34,610
like who's made the decision to
force these people in this situation,

1386
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:36,950
take their passports away.
I don't know who made those decisions,

1387
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,040
but that's all the awful,

1388
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:44,050
but like honestly today I asked
for a decaf and like the chick,

1389
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,970
I know there was caffeine in
that. You're being funny. Yeah,

1390
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:51,350
there you go.
I just like it makes it,

1391
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:55,190
when I'd hear things like that I think
of like, what's The dumbest thing today?

1392
01:19:55,460 --> 01:20:00,050
Twice I thought was
important. Oh, I see. Like I,

1393
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:04,040
you know the things that I'll be
like, ah, this is, this is foam.

1394
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:09,030
You called this foam Barista in
traffic on Santa again and you're like,

1395
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:13,410
I'm Monica Boulevard is bullshit.
Man. Didn't say it was going to rain.

1396
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,820
And then you're like, oh, you had to sleep
head to toe with people that don't pay.

1397
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:20,880
Then you haven't seen your family
in 10 years. The stop light is down.

1398
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:23,910
We have to figure out this
intersection on our own. When I called,

1399
01:20:23,911 --> 01:20:25,530
they said they had my size.

1400
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:30,490
It really makes me feel like a monster.
Well,

1401
01:20:30,491 --> 01:20:35,400
it's terrible when you really stop and
consider how uneven the playing field is

1402
01:20:35,401 --> 01:20:39,240
from, from birth, from birth, death in
this, in this world that we live in.

1403
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,730
Like you can get the
most awesome spot ever.

1404
01:20:41,731 --> 01:20:45,240
Like Amy Schumer and
be born in a nice city.

1405
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:52,680
Nothing.
Dirt floors wasn't born to a rape camp.

1406
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:58,220
You weren't born to some people in
India that's sold you to some government

1407
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:02,550
because they need your money
that they're going to send back.

1408
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:06,810
So you're working in some kitchen
somewhere. Some other country,

1409
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,090
they have your passport,
you can never get home.

1410
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:12,570
She's fucking crimes complaining about
having to learn how to make signature

1411
01:21:12,571 --> 01:21:15,870
cocktails while I bartended. You know,
that's a real issue of the passport thing.

1412
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,330
They, they take their passports
and they can't go back,

1413
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:22,710
which is just dark as fuck. That
is really dark. I mean, that's,

1414
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:26,520
that's slavery. That's essentially like
you're not, I mean, there's no dogs,

1415
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:28,710
there's no gates,
there's no guys with guns.

1416
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:35,670
They let you send your saddest
amount of money home apparently.

1417
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,310
But who knows. I mean, who knows
if that money even gets there.

1418
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:41,610
If you can't communicate with your
friends back home or your family back home

1419
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:43,350
and how are you communicating
with them if you're not,

1420
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:47,280
if you are communicating with them and
it's free and uncensored, you'd be saying,

1421
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:50,310
get me the fuck outta here. They have
been, they're holding me hostage.

1422
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:52,620
Like just the people that get taken.

1423
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:56,310
But there's also that's going on
where they didn't take their passport,

1424
01:21:56,311 --> 01:22:00,190
but it's the only way that they can send
money home. And it's voluntary, but no,

1425
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:04,020
no doubt.
There's a bunch of different variables.

1426
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:08,130
There's a bunch of different variables
when it comes to people that live,

1427
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:08,371
you know,

1428
01:22:08,371 --> 01:22:13,371
if you are born in a third world country
or really poor village are really poor

1429
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:16,500
neighborhood somewhere,
it's a fucking huge handicap.

1430
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:20,550
Starting from there is incredibly
difficult. I have a friend,

1431
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:24,600
his name is Justin Wren and uh,
he's been on the podcast before.

1432
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:28,950
He used to be a UFC fighter and
then he went to the Congo and, um,

1433
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:33,630
met these pygmies and he's become obsessed
with helping them and saving them.

1434
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:34,800
So he,
uh,

1435
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:39,270
he takes donations and he goes over
there and builds wells for them and helps

1436
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:44,190
them and doers all sorts of personal
tragedies with them. He's gotten sick.

1437
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:46,750
He's got some horrible
like Dang gay fever.

1438
01:22:46,751 --> 01:22:49,950
He almost died when he was over
there. I mean, like really horrible,

1439
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:53,190
horrible shit to just to go over there
and try to help these people just because

1440
01:22:53,191 --> 01:22:56,570
he was over there and he just recognize
he had this feeling like, oh my God, like,

1441
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:00,660
these people are so unhealthy and I
can help. Like I know I can help them.

1442
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,410
So he just felt incredibly compelled to
make that like his life's mission to try

1443
01:23:05,411 --> 01:23:07,720
to help these people.
So really, um, there's,

1444
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:10,570
there's some right now that's the pictures
of him with all these pygmy people

1445
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,750
and so unbelievably touching story.
He's like the sweetest guy ever.

1446
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,890
He was a fighter, fought in
the UFC. He's a very tough guy.

1447
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:21,710
He was on the ultimate
fighter. And, uh, you know,

1448
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:25,050
he's going through all this shit like
bullshit depression and you know,

1449
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,600
alcoholism and you know,
all the problems that a,

1450
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:33,400
a lot of people go through in this life
and found a new purpose when he went

1451
01:23:33,401 --> 01:23:36,580
over and met these people. You
feel susceptible to that. Yeah,

1452
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:38,860
you can get definitely get
susceptible. What, which part?

1453
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:42,900
I mean you personally like I could see
you getting real into a specific cause

1454
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,700
but now that you would like your families.
Well I would definitely,

1455
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,810
I absolutely could see myself
getting into a certain cause,

1456
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:49,990
something along those lines,

1457
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:54,520
but I just don't have the time to
dedicate to go over to the Congo and I

1458
01:23:54,521 --> 01:23:56,980
appreciate and respect that he does,
you know,

1459
01:23:56,981 --> 01:24:00,730
and I donate and I think that
donating to anything is a good cause.

1460
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:03,100
Donate to anything where you can,
you know,

1461
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:05,860
change people's lives like directly.

1462
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:10,600
I think that's a good thing for you to do
with your time. I think no matter what,

1463
01:24:10,601 --> 01:24:15,601
if you can find something in life that
enhances your perspective on the world

1464
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,420
because you've done something positive,
that's a good thing.

1465
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,060
I think that's really what I got out of
what he did the most is that it really

1466
01:24:22,061 --> 01:24:24,310
truly enhanced his
perspective of the world.

1467
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:28,720
He became like this really happy guy with
like a real mission and he sees like a

1468
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:33,190
tangible result and all the care and
helped an aid that he gives these people.

1469
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:37,800
It's just cool as fuck cause it's
so selfless and it's so, it's,

1470
01:24:37,801 --> 01:24:39,640
it's beautiful in that regard.
You know,

1471
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,140
I think anytime we see something
like that, it elevates all of us as,

1472
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,470
as a species.
You know,

1473
01:24:44,471 --> 01:24:47,380
I mean anytime you see someone who is so
selfless like that does something like

1474
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:51,670
super, super positive. It just, it
elevates us as a species. You know,

1475
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:57,630
that and that guy's just a awesome
example of what a human beings capable of.

1476
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:00,003
It's cool.

1477
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:04,390
And it's also fascinating thing that this
guy was like in the dumps and his life

1478
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:06,160
was terrible until he started doing this.

1479
01:25:06,161 --> 01:25:09,610
And now he's like this really driven
happy person. He showed us pictures,

1480
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:14,590
he's smiling and loves those people so
much. Why was his life in the dumps? Just,

1481
01:25:14,591 --> 01:25:18,220
you know, hard time. First of all, being
a fighter's unbelievably difficult,

1482
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:22,660
very strenuous, very nerve wracking.
They're always nervous. They're always,

1483
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:26,620
you know, forcing themselves
to get into unbelievable shape.

1484
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,440
You're constantly disciplined because
you're doing strength and conditioning

1485
01:25:29,441 --> 01:25:30,070
work.

1486
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:33,370
Then you go into a spar later that night
and then you wake up in the morning,

1487
01:25:33,371 --> 01:25:36,490
you gonna hit Mitts and then later that
night you're going to lift weights and

1488
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:39,460
then the next day you're going to wrestle
and then at nighttime you're going to

1489
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:42,610
kick box and then it's, it never ends.
It just keeps going and keeps going.

1490
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:45,850
There's never enough fucking
hurdles to jump over.

1491
01:25:45,851 --> 01:25:49,090
There's never enough kettle bells to
lift is never enough myths to punch.

1492
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:53,740
There's never enough bodies
to spar with. You keep going,
going, going, going, going,

1493
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:56,740
going, going, and you red line
your body in a lot of ways.

1494
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:59,740
And a lot of guys get depressed just
from that, just from overtraining.

1495
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:02,110
That gets sick a lot.
They're exhausted,

1496
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,890
but if you don't put
yourself through that,

1497
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:08,270
then you get your ass kicked
and that's even worse. Yeah,

1498
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:12,020
it's a lot of shit involved. And being a
fighter. We think being a comic is hard.

1499
01:26:12,021 --> 01:26:15,080
It's a choke. No, I mean
the, I don't know any,

1500
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:20,060
I don't know any UFC fighters,
but even just what wrestlers go through,

1501
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:23,990
I'm just like, man, that's
unbelievably hard for your body too,

1502
01:26:23,991 --> 01:26:27,890
because what they're doing, car accident
all over and over and over again,

1503
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:31,190
over and over and over again.
I felt like that

1504
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:37,310
actually in Orlando. Well, you
know, there's a lot of 'em for sure.

1505
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:41,630
There's a lot of bad feelings that come
from bombing and it's not good for you

1506
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:45,500
and it's, it's damaging. The
issue about sports though,

1507
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,550
or wrestling or anything along those
lines is that it sort of breaks your body

1508
01:26:49,551 --> 01:26:54,551
down and then you got to live the last
third of your life or half of your life

1509
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:58,430
with a body that's essentially wrecked
from the first half isn't the same as

1510
01:26:58,431 --> 01:27:03,040
ballerinas. Some of them, you know, I
don't know if all of them get fucked up.

1511
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:07,460
They all get fucked up. I don't know.
Like what is the thing that goes wrong?

1512
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:12,500
What goes wrong? Oh, like
you're just murdering your body.

1513
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:17,330
Like just the arthritis that sets in
and standing on your toes. If you don't,

1514
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,150
if you don't actually ever get injured,
which they all do,

1515
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,280
it's still just so hard on your body.

1516
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:25,880
Like you can't like walk as long
as he would. You know what I heard?

1517
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:30,410
I heard they just fuck a lot and
they blame the injuries on ballet.

1518
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,630
Endless Ballerina.

1519
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:39,840
I heard they just get a lot of ballet
Dick like Baryshnikov Dick talk like

1520
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:44,490
crazy. The guy from that movie
blocks all of those girls.

1521
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:48,380
The Guy, the director guy, he's always the
guy. He makes it, he's aloof with them.

1522
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:51,560
He plays games.
He fucked the other girls to remember.

1523
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:55,460
I remember he was like really mean
and he got them really insecure.

1524
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:57,860
He pulls him in clothes.
Then he pushes him away.

1525
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:01,190
He plays those creepy creepy games.
Yeah, I guess you're right. That guy did.

1526
01:28:01,191 --> 01:28:04,430
Fuck everybody.
If he's a heterosexual,

1527
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,100
he's around all these insecure
women and he has a power over them.

1528
01:28:07,101 --> 01:28:10,460
Like he gets it. He's the director.
That dude just bang and left and right.

1529
01:28:10,461 --> 01:28:12,770
That dirty bastard. He's
horrible. He's a terrible person.

1530
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:15,140
Might as well be drugging them.
My opinion,

1531
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:19,910
it seems like what guys should do guys
become comics to, to hook up with girls.

1532
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:22,430
It's stupid just,
well the one guy in ballet,

1533
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:25,760
well I don't know if guys become
comics to hook up with girls,

1534
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:30,590
but they definitely become funny to make
girls laugh at them and then along the

1535
01:28:30,591 --> 01:28:35,510
way they look at their career options and
usually their burger fork and form and

1536
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,250
standup looks incredibly attractive.

1537
01:28:37,251 --> 01:28:40,850
And then along the way they realize from
doing shows that you could hook up with

1538
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:44,450
girls. Yeah. I think very few
comics get into comedy going,

1539
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:46,580
I'm going to be really funny
so I can hook up with girls.

1540
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:50,300
I think it's sort of a
consequence of like, you know,

1541
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:54,860
they just realized as they were
after they started. Oh yeah,

1542
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:58,470
I'm friends with her. Yeah, I guess they,

1543
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:01,880
they just make it sound like that was
a part of why they got into it. Well,

1544
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:04,270
I think it's probably part of what
makes him funny for sure. Yeah.

1545
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:09,180
It was probably one of the only times I
was ever funny before I was a comedian

1546
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:13,420
was like talking to girls, you know, we're
trying, you're trying to impress him.

1547
01:29:13,421 --> 01:29:16,470
It's probably one of the only times I
was ever funny like making fun of things

1548
01:29:16,471 --> 01:29:21,120
are mocking things and it was that
or locker room stuff with my friends.

1549
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:24,750
There's a lot of that. A lot of like,
oh, just like me. Well I, you know,

1550
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:28,210
I came from a weird place
because I came from a PR, like a,

1551
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:32,550
I was a martial arts instructor.
I know it was a competitor and I did.

1552
01:29:32,551 --> 01:29:35,130
That was like the main
focus in my life growing up,

1553
01:29:35,131 --> 01:29:38,820
so I didn't have a normal
upbringing in that sense.

1554
01:29:38,821 --> 01:29:41,670
It was very abnormal.
There was no partying,

1555
01:29:41,671 --> 01:29:45,450
there was no very little drinking
or any of that. You know,

1556
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,900
had a couple of girlfriends that tolerated
me for small periods of time and then

1557
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:52,040
they'd eventually just get
tired of me being crazy girls.

1558
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:56,890
Just like going to your like
martial arts shows like, yeah.

1559
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,660
I don't think I ever brought one to a
fight and actual fight. Too much pressure.

1560
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,080
Yeah. I wouldn't want to watch him sit
there in the audience watching me and me

1561
01:30:07,081 --> 01:30:08,190
thinking about them watching me.

1562
01:30:08,191 --> 01:30:11,380
Like my sister came to see me fight
once and I remember it to be in a wreck.

1563
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:14,260
It's one thing I really appreciated
about my parents. They never,

1564
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:18,750
they never like for, they never said, I am
going to your fight. Like you know they,

1565
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:22,440
they would say, do you want us to go
this fuck that. I'm like, no, don't go.

1566
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,300
Oh really? No. I don't want,

1567
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:28,740
I don't want them to see
me hurting anybody and be
upset at me and I didn't want

1568
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:33,720
to see anybody hurting me and them being
upset and then the idea that I could

1569
01:30:33,721 --> 01:30:36,270
get hurt in front of my mother,
it was like extra pressure.

1570
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,050
The idea that I would lose in front of
my mother. That was also extra pressure.

1571
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:45,030
Like it's a very solitary
pursuit. Martial arts. Yes.

1572
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:47,610
They've seen me do stand up a bunch
of times. It could be a complete, no,

1573
01:30:47,611 --> 01:30:51,630
not at all. Totally different thing, you
know, because the stand up, it's just fun.

1574
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:55,400
You know? It's, it was bad
at the beginning when I
wasn't very good, you know,

1575
01:30:55,440 --> 01:31:00,120
I'd be like, fuck man, I'm bombing. So my
parents, but uh, once I got good it was,

1576
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:03,570
um, it was pretty easy to have him
there. It's fun. It's fun to have them.

1577
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:06,660
They're fighting was a totally
different thing though. It's just more,

1578
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:10,200
more creepy. It's just too many
things to manage, you know,

1579
01:31:10,201 --> 01:31:13,340
you're more inside your head.
So I wasn't really fun.

1580
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:18,160
I was rarely funny with girls even,
let's just rarely funny. Yeah.

1581
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,450
I wasn't funny at all until I decided to
become a comedian. I was more of like a,

1582
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:27,270
a questioning person than funny.
But you seem like,

1583
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,250
I think it would be
funny just by accident.

1584
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,990
Like didn't you just make people laugh?
Well,

1585
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:33,990
that's what happened was the reason I
got talked into doing stand up in the

1586
01:31:33,991 --> 01:31:37,710
first place was guys in the locker room.
I would be doing impressions of, uh,

1587
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:38,491
each other.

1588
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:41,580
Like I'd be doing impressions
of my instructor having
sex with one of students,

1589
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:47,790
uh, or other friends. You know,
I would make fun of things,

1590
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:51,900
but it was really rare, you know?
But every now and then I would do,

1591
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:54,930
it wasn't like something I did every day,
but when you did it, everybody was like,

1592
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:58,100
every now and then I would, I would
wait until they were good. You know,

1593
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,180
I'd have something,
I had to have some something

1594
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:05,110
actually funny. Yeah. I wasn't
like, it was a very quiet thing.

1595
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:05,840
Like Marshall,

1596
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,710
everybody was very friendly and
everybody would go into the locker room.

1597
01:32:08,711 --> 01:32:10,570
What's up, what's up with it? But
we knew what we're going to do.

1598
01:32:10,571 --> 01:32:13,600
We're going to go out there and we're
going to kick each other and punch each

1599
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:13,721
other.

1600
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:17,680
It was a very nerve wracking thing to
be like very close with people that beat

1601
01:32:17,681 --> 01:32:19,410
you up.
But like

1602
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:22,600
I know that that fighting
is totally different.

1603
01:32:22,601 --> 01:32:27,550
But I do see a lot of parallels with,
with stand up with that because it's like,

1604
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:30,940
yeah, these are the people you're most
threatened by. You feel the closest too.

1605
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:35,360
In a way. Yeah. Yeah. These are, there's,
there's some similarities for sure.

1606
01:32:35,361 --> 01:32:36,730
I think there's some,
yeah.

1607
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:41,710
Thinking about just, and even
like, I like watching, um, uh,

1608
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:46,150
I always liked rap battles.
I mean, growing up I just
like was interested in them.

1609
01:32:46,151 --> 01:32:47,240
I still like them and then,

1610
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,990
and I never made the connection
that those were kind of like,

1611
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:53,830
roasts are like hanging out with
comics to me, but it's like, of course,

1612
01:32:53,831 --> 01:32:58,720
like even the Wu Tang album
[inaudible] um, at the beginning of a,

1613
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:03,100
of method man of, uh, that song. It's like
they're just trashing each other saying,

1614
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,390
right, what they're going to do. And
I'm like, and I loved, I loved that,

1615
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:08,860
that growing up.
And then I'm like,

1616
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,710
I never even made that connection
until really recently. Oh yeah.

1617
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,390
Well, battle rap is all about, you know,

1618
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,470
coming out on top and everybody would
come up with the most vicious scathing

1619
01:33:19,471 --> 01:33:24,090
shit. And I'd say about a dude's
mother. Yeah. And make it rhyme.

1620
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:27,030
But how many times you've seen
battle rap that ends in fisticuffs?

1621
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:30,360
There's a bunch of those videos online.
Right.

1622
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:33,990
It always looks like they're about
to some fair are, you know, they're,

1623
01:33:33,991 --> 01:33:37,860
they're saying some really nasty shit to
each other. Yeah. Yeah. In a way. Yeah.

1624
01:33:37,861 --> 01:33:40,170
I think that's probably a lot
like stand up, but stand up.

1625
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,920
It's rare that we go head to head with
each other like that. Like that's doesn't,

1626
01:33:43,921 --> 01:33:47,250
it's only a roast where that
kind of happens and even then,

1627
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,920
but then can't respond for awhile.

1628
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:54,310
Yeah. But even if it's not like,
but even I know you, you and I,

1629
01:33:54,311 --> 01:33:58,360
both of heckler people put videos of us
when dealing with hecklers online and

1630
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,910
that feels like you're fighting training.

1631
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:05,860
Like I think that stuff
plays a part in just in,

1632
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:08,140
just like your defense mechanisms,
how you're set up,

1633
01:34:08,141 --> 01:34:11,020
how you've been preparing
for these moments you didn't
even know you're going to

1634
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:11,863
have

1635
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:12,821
sort of,

1636
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:16,810
it's also you recognize you have to
handle something in real time and you have

1637
01:34:16,811 --> 01:34:19,610
to also be completely in the moment
while you're handling it. Yeah.

1638
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:22,630
Because if you, you're, you're
directing a moment. Yeah.

1639
01:34:22,631 --> 01:34:24,970
Work x amount of people in the audience.

1640
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,660
They all paid to see you and some shit's
going down in real time if they need to

1641
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:29,400
control.

1642
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:32,470
And sometimes you'll slip and you'll
say something awkward or you just say

1643
01:34:32,471 --> 01:34:36,610
something that's just like
forced or stupid or too
much. And the crowd was like,

1644
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:40,360
Whoa, Amy, he's just a drunk.

1645
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:45,400
I mean I've had some people swear that
things were planted just cause people are

1646
01:34:45,401 --> 01:34:49,140
so ridiculous. Right? I had a guy, God
damn, and I can't remember where I feel,

1647
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:50,590
I want to say it was Milwaukee,

1648
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:54,520
but there was a guy that was so drunk
that he came up to the side of the stage

1649
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:58,130
and he was literally falling
over and he reached up his hand,

1650
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:02,390
like to shake my hand and then like was
like blacking out. And I caught his hand.

1651
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:03,530
I was holding onto his wrist.

1652
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:07,480
I was literally keeping this guy standing
like he was that fucked up. Right.

1653
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:10,160
And the audience was how little I'm like,
this is,

1654
01:35:10,161 --> 01:35:13,670
I've never had to hold a guy up.
Like how fucked up is this guy?

1655
01:35:13,671 --> 01:35:18,600
Like he stumbled out of his chair, came
like lunging towards the, uh, the, the,

1656
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:21,920
the stage to the point where I was
wondering if he was handicapped.

1657
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:24,860
I was wondering if you had like an
issue with his muscles or something,

1658
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:26,960
some physical issue.
And that's really hard.

1659
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:29,480
That's what it's the hardest to deal
with somebody. Like if you're like, wait,

1660
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:34,430
this guy might have had something wrong
with them. Like top of being fucked up.

1661
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:37,610
Yeah. But the fucked up thing,
there's a video of it somewhere.

1662
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:40,160
I have a video of me
holding this guy up by,

1663
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:43,430
so it was like to show that it really
is real. Love it. They're like,

1664
01:35:43,431 --> 01:35:46,520
cause it's like this real moment.
They're like, well, so ridiculous.

1665
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:50,090
But I mean those moments like
Amy Schumer's responsible for,

1666
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:54,130
you're responsible for, you know, in
real time it, here's the guy. Like he's,

1667
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:55,280
he's standing there.

1668
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:02,530
Are you going back to your seat? If You
pee your pants, we're going to nuts. Yeah.

1669
01:36:02,531 --> 01:36:05,270
Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. Amy Schumer
is going to pee while this guy,

1670
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:09,280
but I want to sit
back.

1671
01:36:09,281 --> 01:36:12,340
Man represents the world.
He's the roots of your tree.

1672
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:16,050
Well you are right now.

1673
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:19,840
Maybe the trunk is guys ever survived.

1674
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:26,200
We're going to learn something
just by watching you take,

1675
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:30,650
you need to sit the fuck down across
legging and just close your eyes and think

1676
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:33,350
about the seventh grade cause there's
no way making up those stairs.

1677
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:37,760
Clearly you've made some mistakes.
Let's go back.

1678
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,830
Let's go back to grammar school.

1679
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:45,720
Let's go to seventh grade
feeling good.

1680
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:49,370
Two years you get to be 14 that's
when your brother got some sex.

1681
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:53,330
Are you really trying to walk?
Why are you doing that?

1682
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:55,730
Get on your knees and your hands and crawl

1683
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,250
because you don't have the
mentality of a Zubin right now.

1684
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:05,590
That's why your mind doesn't
want to do that like a baby.

1685
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,433
You'd be fine.

1686
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,500
That's that guy.

1687
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:18,520
This was his buddy who's with him.
Are you with you?

1688
01:37:18,910 --> 01:37:23,210
Is that your friend whose weight?
Then you folks have sensible,

1689
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:26,330
fairly sober. This is men.
Traveling Solo was amazing.

1690
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:32,570
Nope,
I don't drink that much to stay alive.

1691
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:38,090
Do you have any idea that I was
grabbing him and holding on questions

1692
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:47,750
and then there's that happening over there

1693
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:51,890
and he's going to look up

1694
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:59,511
when you love.

1695
01:37:59,511 --> 01:38:04,511
Do you see that guys as he
slowly makes it to that toilet.

1696
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:08,730
Okay. There's those moments, man,

1697
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:11,560
we need to put your forehead
on the white porcelain.

1698
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:15,260
You pee and you're like,

1699
01:38:15,610 --> 01:38:18,190
I gotta fix so many things about my life

1700
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:27,340
staring into the abyss of that white
porcelain just comes back to the answers.

1701
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:31,280
I think that's probably the end of it.
Somebody is fucked up though.

1702
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:40,183
Is He?

1703
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,750
Okay. That's probably what
he was thinking about.

1704
01:38:47,751 --> 01:38:49,130
Why he's doing it too much pressure.

1705
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,420
Just always looking for data.

1706
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,560
I completely forgot about that dude.

1707
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:04,160
I totally forgot about that whole
exchange about how long it went on,

1708
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:07,880
but the guy was so drunk
that I was holding him up
and he didn't even look up at

1709
01:39:07,881 --> 01:39:09,530
me.
He was so drunk.

1710
01:39:09,531 --> 01:39:12,560
He was just like letting me hold him up
and he was just sort of looking around

1711
01:39:12,561 --> 01:39:14,750
at the crowd trying to figure out why

1712
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,350
when you were like, where's the
security of this venue? Like, who's Sir?

1713
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:22,860
Oh, no, no, no. They handled
it right away. Like you
could see right here, while,

1714
01:39:22,861 --> 01:39:25,440
while this guy is a stumbling,
this guy comes over,

1715
01:39:25,441 --> 01:39:28,350
the security comes over and
grabs him and they cart them off.

1716
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:31,350
And then I started talking about that.
Guys like the roots of your tree.

1717
01:39:31,351 --> 01:39:35,970
He represents life. Let him hold you up.
And the guy walked the, the dude towards,

1718
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:38,430
uh, towards the back of the
room and then they might,

1719
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:41,250
you talked him through it like,
yeah. Well I had to, I mean, you,

1720
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:43,440
I had to talk about it.
It was just so ridiculous.

1721
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,860
I'd never seen a guy that
drunk. He was, I mean, he was,

1722
01:39:46,861 --> 01:39:50,280
and there was no way he was talking.
He could barely move his body. Right.

1723
01:39:50,281 --> 01:39:53,160
He was just making noises with his mouth.
It didn't represent words.

1724
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,170
You could see that he was
trying to speak English,

1725
01:39:55,171 --> 01:39:59,370
but he was so drunk he couldn't talk
at all. Yeah. This guy's a victim.

1726
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:03,450
Start wondering. You start wondering
what happened, how'd it go wrong?

1727
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:06,830
Right. That's what I was to me too.
And then sometimes like, you know,

1728
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:10,890
if people like keep keep firing at
me, I'm like, don't cause I will,

1729
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,600
I will pinpoint what happened.

1730
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:18,630
It's not good for either one of us.
Know the crowds. Like even if you win,

1731
01:40:18,650 --> 01:40:21,200
you're gonna feel bad later. It's
going to be like, oh did I go too far?

1732
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:22,760
You learned that lesson,

1733
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,800
you know, you learn that
lesson. Then you're like,

1734
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:28,880
I know if I say one more thing I will
regret it for the rest of my life. So,

1735
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:32,160
well then sometimes it's funny when
you go too far and you go, all right,

1736
01:40:32,161 --> 01:40:36,930
I went too far. Yeah,
sorry everybody. Yeah,

1737
01:40:36,931 --> 01:40:41,130
it's all like, do you, if you actually get
angry, that's the debt. That's the thing.

1738
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,690
If you actually get angry,

1739
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:45,270
but I yeah,
cause nobody wants to see that.

1740
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:47,970
But I learned from when I was opening
for Norton and the tell on the road,

1741
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,310
because people would yell shit
at them and they wouldn't,

1742
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:52,770
they wouldn't fire back. It was
never like they were being attacked.

1743
01:40:52,771 --> 01:40:54,010
They would just diffuse.

1744
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,630
So I try to do that now.
But then if somebody keeps coming,

1745
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,540
but then I've also seen if somebody keeps
coming at them, they will go to town.

1746
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:01,771
Yeah.

1747
01:41:01,771 --> 01:41:06,771
There's a difference between someone
having fun and someone that's like fucking

1748
01:41:06,871 --> 01:41:09,570
it all up. You know, at the
risk of encouraging this,

1749
01:41:09,571 --> 01:41:11,610
cause I'm not encouraging this,
but when I was in New York,

1750
01:41:11,611 --> 01:41:13,170
discouraged when I was in New York,

1751
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:17,580
this guy yelled out something that was
fucking hilarious. It was uh, I was uh,

1752
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:19,980
I was talking about the most,

1753
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,920
it was trying to figure out who the most
famous woman in the world was setting

1754
01:41:22,921 --> 01:41:25,470
up this bit and the guy goes,
your mom

1755
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:33,680
just for childish.
I'm 12 reasons I started laughing.

1756
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:38,410
It was just the perfect timing.
Cause it's like, first of all,

1757
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:41,630
that is not true. Your mom is not the
most famous woman, but it doesn't matter

1758
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:47,010
who makes a big best cheeseburgers.
Maybe your mom got me,

1759
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,060
who suck the most.
Dick, probably your mom.

1760
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,210
Like somewhere along the line,

1761
01:41:53,211 --> 01:41:56,420
throughout history there's gotta be a
woman who is sucked the most Dick's ever.

1762
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:59,780
There's a world record holder.
They probably don't keep it officially.

1763
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:02,990
It's not a video. It's
probably done. I'll probably,

1764
01:42:02,991 --> 01:42:06,140
it's on a cave somewhere
carved into the rocks.

1765
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:08,870
It was probably an old record
that nobody ever even clean,

1766
01:42:08,871 --> 01:42:11,360
close to touching with little dick.
Chalk marks

1767
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:15,080
your kettle bells and be like,
wow,

1768
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:18,570
what was going on with this society when
a prisoner is calculating how many days?

1769
01:42:18,571 --> 01:42:20,930
So they get out till they get released.

1770
01:42:20,931 --> 01:42:25,410
They makes those fives on the wall for
straight ones and the one across you go

1771
01:42:25,411 --> 01:42:27,480
over to her,
her a door of death.

1772
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:32,870
And it's just all these dex endless dex
in the cave and write by the cave door.

1773
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:37,380
Brighton. How many dicks you
sucks so hard to get. You know,

1774
01:42:37,381 --> 01:42:39,180
if you have a limps tough
to get some buffalo,

1775
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:43,970
you've got to do what you gotta do.
Oh, but I'm at my point is, yeah,

1776
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:47,910
just that's your mom. I mean, I've
never had somebody heckle that. Good.

1777
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:52,800
Yeah, that's, that's a good hackle. But
it was only in the moment. It was good.

1778
01:42:52,801 --> 01:42:53,970
It was another moment.
It could be

1779
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:57,690
bad, you know, at all.
Anything out it shows. Yeah.

1780
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:00,700
Don't it worked that time.

1781
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:06,280
Then let's talk, I love talking to the
crowd, but did you ever do a Q and a?

1782
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,590
You know what you should do?
There's a thing

1783
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:13,070
they're doing in an la, it's a
podcast called Thunderpussy. Yeah.

1784
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:16,420
And Thunderpussy is you don't go
on stage with any material at all.

1785
01:43:16,421 --> 01:43:21,270
Zero material and the audience
yells out suggestions. No,

1786
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:25,540
it's red band, red band.
And um, Jeremiah, Jeremiah,

1787
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:30,340
Jeremiah walked in, sorry, Jeremiah, I
spaced on his name. Jeremiah Watkins,

1788
01:43:30,341 --> 01:43:31,180
very funny young kid.

1789
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:36,220
And he and Brian have this podcast where
they have guys go up there and they do

1790
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:38,680
that. They do everything
is completely off the cuff.

1791
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:39,760
You do everything with the audience,

1792
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:43,680
but isn't it better to do
the stuff that you know work

1793
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:49,740
sometimes,
but as an artistic exercise,

1794
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:53,660
it's a great exercise in because you
come up with bits and then they become

1795
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:54,494
actual beds.

1796
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:57,560
You come up with bits when someone yells
out something and you have a suggestion

1797
01:43:57,561 --> 01:44:01,070
and then you try to work
it out like several times.

1798
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:06,110
Several Times I've come up with actual
real bits from that that have become real

1799
01:44:06,111 --> 01:44:06,560
bits.

1800
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,560
I try to like make myself do at least a
couple of new things and every night on

1801
01:44:12,171 --> 01:44:16,730
stage. That's good. Yeah.
But I mean it's, it's hard.

1802
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:19,310
It's definitely hard. Like they
can sense it. They're like,

1803
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:22,610
that's one of the things that's amazing
about this I this Thunderpussy ideas

1804
01:44:22,611 --> 01:44:27,140
because you're doing an hour and
yeah, well me, I did an hour,

1805
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:31,310
I did an hour, one hour once
in an hour, 10 another time.

1806
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:34,910
How much time did you get out of that
in the long run for or 10 minutes of the

1807
01:44:34,911 --> 01:44:39,720
two sets. Yeah. That's amazing. Two
sets is 10 whole minutes. So you know,

1808
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:41,810
a lot of it gets tossed out.
A lot of it's in the moment.

1809
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:45,220
A lot of it is not applicable
or maybe it is someday.

1810
01:44:45,230 --> 01:44:49,220
Once I hashed it out and was
here in Scotland, Edinburgh,

1811
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,710
people that do that,
they say like, you know,

1812
01:44:51,711 --> 01:44:54,710
you're there for like a month and you
have to do a different hour every night.

1813
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:58,370
That's what some comics say
that they go and they do that.

1814
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:03,260
You get so much time out of, it didn't
merit or is it Melbourne? One of those.

1815
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:08,290
The Marin has a fantastic story about
going over to some festival in bombing

1816
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:11,250
horrifically. That's probably
Melbourne. I think it's a male.

1817
01:45:11,251 --> 01:45:12,620
It was a great story though.

1818
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:15,920
That's a really good at telling it cause
he's like really early on in his career

1819
01:45:15,921 --> 01:45:19,130
and just the whole thing was just wrong.

1820
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:21,730
You know the wrong vibe thing where it's,

1821
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:26,120
you get caught up in the wrong and
if you start off a week following,

1822
01:45:26,150 --> 01:45:28,850
totally brings up so
many feelings right away.

1823
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:32,840
Never recover that feeling when you
start off Thursday night eating shit on

1824
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:35,450
stage in your head,
you're like,

1825
01:45:35,451 --> 01:45:38,410
how am I even still standing here
when all the bloods and my head,

1826
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:40,280
you can't even believe they're
gonna let you go up on Friday.

1827
01:45:40,281 --> 01:45:42,560
But it's just because they couldn't find
a substitute for you and you're like,

1828
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:44,160
oh my God,
here we go again.

1829
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:47,810
Seeing spots like it's such a bad feeling.

1830
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:52,400
I had two sets of this one
place in Connecticut. The
first that I had was great.

1831
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:56,240
It was really fun. It was easy.
It was fun. The second set I had,

1832
01:45:56,300 --> 01:46:01,220
it was awful. I was
terrible. I just bombed. No,

1833
01:46:01,221 --> 01:46:03,770
it wasn't even hard for it.
It was like some Bar Gig in Connecticut,

1834
01:46:03,771 --> 01:46:06,140
but it was just early on in
my career and it was just,

1835
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:09,800
I had another one after
that that went well,

1836
01:46:09,801 --> 01:46:14,330
but the everyone gave me the stink.
I stink.

1837
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:19,420
I couldn't believe that I did well
this time compared to the last time.

1838
01:46:19,731 --> 01:46:22,490
They want to keep bringing up the last
time, even though I had a good set,

1839
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:25,550
they kept wanting to bring up the last
time when I ate shit up there. I'm like,

1840
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:29,420
I know I didn't do it on purpose,
feeling it.

1841
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:33,580
I bombed so bad. I don't think
I ever told us here. But um,

1842
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:37,280
at the Schomburg Improv,
which they call the Chicago Improv,

1843
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:40,600
I know where that place,
it's an hour away from Chicago already.

1844
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:43,610
Miles from Chicago was an hour
if you're lucky. But anyway,

1845
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:48,670
I went there and I was opening for
Tammy and I went out there and I'm like,

1846
01:46:48,711 --> 01:46:50,100
I did.
And I was used to,

1847
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,630
I was like in the middle doing last comic.

1848
01:46:51,631 --> 01:46:54,600
So I've been dealing with all paid
audiences. So I was like, I was like,

1849
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:56,380
I think I'm a killer now.
And I went up,

1850
01:46:57,010 --> 01:47:02,010
I mean bomb it like 20
minutes of just zero,

1851
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:05,700
like where I was, like I almost said,
is this thing on? Like it was that bad.

1852
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:07,980
And so it's my,
it was my second night and I'm just,

1853
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:13,020
I'm like 10 minutes into my 20 and I'm
dying and Tammy comes on stage and takes

1854
01:47:13,861 --> 01:47:17,760
the mic out of my hand and
I'm like, Whoa, you know,

1855
01:47:17,761 --> 01:47:20,840
and I'm always like ready to say
something. Like I'm a wise that I had,

1856
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:24,750
I couldn't believe it. She goes,
Amy, um, and she's like, everyone,

1857
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:28,470
I'm really sorry but there's
been a bomb threat. And I'm like,

1858
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:31,590
this is what she says when
someone's bombing like this bitch,

1859
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:34,050
I cannot believe this. But
there was, it's in a strip mall,

1860
01:47:34,051 --> 01:47:35,190
there was a bomb threat in the mall,

1861
01:47:35,191 --> 01:47:37,620
so we all to evacuate and she
wanted to be the ones to tell them.

1862
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:42,330
And so we're all like, ah. And I was
like, fucking thank God, you know,

1863
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:47,160
this divider or all filing out together
and I'm filing out with the crowd.

1864
01:47:47,161 --> 01:47:50,820
And they're all talking about
like how horrible I was.

1865
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,150
And then just night after night,
just taking it to the chin,

1866
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:56,970
just going out there and just eating it.

1867
01:47:57,750 --> 01:48:02,640
So awful bomb threat while
you're bombing is never,

1868
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:07,110
never good though.
I don't know if I have an APP on my phone,

1869
01:48:07,111 --> 01:48:11,600
like calling a friend, like just
buffalo in five minutes. Okay.

1870
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:16,370
What was wrong?
It was me.

1871
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:18,930
I wasn't comic.

1872
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:24,920
Just I think bombing so many times that
you just don't care and then once you

1873
01:48:26,431 --> 01:48:30,690
don't care. Yeah, because they're
not worried. They trust you.

1874
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:33,930
And cause I think my jokes were funny.
It wasn't that my material,

1875
01:48:33,931 --> 01:48:37,080
I got that much better. You're just
nervous up there. I was just like,

1876
01:48:37,081 --> 01:48:41,280
is this okay? Is this okay? Is this funny?
Oh that wasn't funny. Okay. Like quick,

1877
01:48:41,281 --> 01:48:43,740
let me get to this other
thing. Is this fun? You know,

1878
01:48:43,741 --> 01:48:47,760
just tap dancing through my set.
And then, and then it was like, oh,

1879
01:48:47,761 --> 01:48:48,810
that made you upset.

1880
01:48:48,811 --> 01:48:52,650
Well let me say this thing that's 10
times worse than that last thing you got

1881
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:56,190
mad at and I don't care. And then, yeah,

1882
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:59,340
just and then just being
totally unapologetic. Yeah.

1883
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:04,360
Now it's more difficult as
a woman to do stand up. No,

1884
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:08,400
I've had a very sweet path like I,

1885
01:49:08,401 --> 01:49:12,120
and I think I've worked really hard
and I think, I dunno what the quote is,

1886
01:49:12,121 --> 01:49:17,121
but like opportunity plus
preparation equals something.

1887
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:22,130
Okay. Thanks. Um, I don't know, but
it's like I have worked really hard but,

1888
01:49:22,650 --> 01:49:26,130
but I, um, I think it's annoying.
I think it's harder to be a woman.

1889
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:30,780
I think being a chick sucks and I wouldn't
wish it on anybody really. For Real.

1890
01:49:30,781 --> 01:49:34,050
Yes. Really? Yes. It's awful. It's awful.

1891
01:49:34,051 --> 01:49:36,270
But everything,

1892
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:40,140
you're like born with this invisible
calendar counting down to your last

1893
01:49:40,141 --> 01:49:42,270
fuckable day. You're, you're,

1894
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:46,770
you're valued by your
appearance above all else,

1895
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:47,793
but at the same

1896
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:52,390
you bake less. You're, you're
taught that there's no,

1897
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,930
there's no ceiling to what you can
do. No limit. And then you learn. Yes,

1898
01:49:55,931 --> 01:50:00,931
there is and society wants only a specific
thing from you and even though your

1899
01:50:01,421 --> 01:50:02,550
program to different ones,
right.

1900
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:07,920
But aren't you lucky breaks that that's
always going to be the case. Right.

1901
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:10,630
But aren't you proof positive that
there is no ceiling and that you've,

1902
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:13,890
you can be successful with hard work and
talent. I mean that's what you've done,

1903
01:50:13,891 --> 01:50:16,770
right. I think you're way more
talented than a lot of men.

1904
01:50:16,771 --> 01:50:19,530
I know way more successful as well,

1905
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:25,230
but the people that have seen those men
and me perform would still tell me that

1906
01:50:25,511 --> 01:50:27,840
I was their favorite female
comedian they've ever seen.

1907
01:50:28,110 --> 01:50:31,110
Ah.
Like it's a handicap like you would say.

1908
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:35,060
Would you say that like you're my favorite
black comedian I've ever seen. It's,

1909
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:38,580
I think it's really weird.
Yeah. Well fuck them for that.

1910
01:50:38,581 --> 01:50:42,900
But I've said that before. She's one of
the funniest girls ever. All time. Yeah.

1911
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:47,550
Well, you know like Roseanne Barr
was on and um, I went like super,

1912
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:51,750
super conscious to not say that she's
one of the funniest women of all time.

1913
01:50:51,751 --> 01:50:54,570
Cause I think she's one of the great ones.
Yeah. I think if you had to pick like,

1914
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:59,520
you know, like a top 50 greatest comedian
list ever. Roseanne Barr in my opinion,

1915
01:50:59,521 --> 01:51:03,140
is like, she's a real, she
was a real pioneer. Yeah.

1916
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:06,750
Because she had a very specific
unique style. When she came out,

1917
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:10,920
she was hard hitting and aggressive and
she didn't give a fuck if you liked her.

1918
01:51:10,921 --> 01:51:14,790
She wasn't trying to look pretty
shad. Ah, you know, she just,

1919
01:51:15,090 --> 01:51:18,510
and she shoved it down your throat just
knowing it was good and well written

1920
01:51:18,511 --> 01:51:22,890
stuff and performance
delivery. So yeah, I, I made,

1921
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:25,110
I could see how that would be annoying.

1922
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:29,920
Like just numbers.
Like how many,

1923
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:33,310
how many female comics are headlining
theaters on the road. Right.

1924
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:37,360
How many of them are in
successful relationships?

1925
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,320
How many of them?
Yeah,

1926
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:41,610
you've seen a Palicki. That's it. Yeah.

1927
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:47,670
They sort of broke the rule. The boss.
I mean I'm Voss and Bonnie. Yeah.

1928
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:51,040
You know, there's like, there's
a couple of exceptions, you know,

1929
01:51:51,041 --> 01:51:54,220
statistically it's not
looking good for the Laneys.

1930
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:58,070
Awesome. Bonnie's hilarious too. Cause
Bonnie's a smart one and bosses the,

1931
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:01,590
you know, the, the, the, the guy who
was constantly the button box there,

1932
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:05,490
he's the butt of the jokes, like
all of their podcasts, you know,

1933
01:52:05,491 --> 01:52:07,700
it's like Shim her shitting
all over how dummy.

1934
01:52:07,870 --> 01:52:11,020
Yeah. But then it's like,
you know, it's like I,

1935
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:14,920
I am successful as a comic right now.
But then it's like,

1936
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:19,390
but then there's also a price to
be paid for that, for being a girl

1937
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:23,430
anyway. Okay. But is it with everybody
or is it with idiots, you know,

1938
01:52:23,431 --> 01:52:27,090
and isn't the price that you pay when
you're rowing idiots? No, I mean,

1939
01:52:27,091 --> 01:52:28,920
good people, nice people. I think.

1940
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:33,930
I think it's, most people
still want a kind of, I think,

1941
01:52:33,931 --> 01:52:38,790
I think some people are grateful
for for the female comics that they,

1942
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:42,510
they love love. Like, like
I was grateful for the,

1943
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:45,710
my favorite comics where
we're girls growing up and,

1944
01:52:45,711 --> 01:52:49,250
and those comedic actresses and
I was really grateful for them.

1945
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:51,620
And so I still,

1946
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:55,640
and I hope that people will feel
that way about me one day, but,

1947
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:59,210
um,
what the fuck am I talking about?

1948
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:02,000
I'm just talking about the differences
when we were just discussing the

1949
01:53:02,001 --> 01:53:05,720
differences between men and female comics
and how few female comics there are

1950
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:06,351
and about,

1951
01:53:06,351 --> 01:53:09,950
when you look at the number of females
that are headlining theaters and that

1952
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:11,600
they were always your biggest influences.

1953
01:53:11,601 --> 01:53:14,660
And you're always big fans of these female
comedians. That's what you're saying.

1954
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:19,310
Good listener. I'm very
fascinated by the subject because,

1955
01:53:19,311 --> 01:53:20,240
um,
you know,

1956
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:24,410
I had a conversation once with Judy gold
about an interview that I did where we

1957
01:53:24,411 --> 01:53:28,480
were, we were talking about,
she's so funny. She's very
funny. She's an animal too.

1958
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:33,230
She, she fucking, she's a killer.
She's so good. Uh, but she's also,

1959
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:37,730
you know, smart quick. If you fuck
with her, she'll kill you. You know,

1960
01:53:37,731 --> 01:53:42,650
she knows how to just shut things down
like especially a heckler shuts them down.

1961
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:45,950
Oh, I remember it. I was gonna say,
um, well please do it. Say it then.

1962
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:46,760
Oh,
sorry.

1963
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:51,200
But I think a lot of people are probably
pretty relieved when Judy and I leave

1964
01:53:51,201 --> 01:53:52,034
the room.

1965
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:55,070
Wow. That's, come on. No
one who's worth a fuck.

1966
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:56,750
Yeah. I, no, I think you're right.

1967
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:01,550
And the people I'm close to and the people
that I love and that I care about are,

1968
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:03,170
you know, are in our, into it.

1969
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:08,380
But I think still there's a lot of work
to be done in the world with like the

1970
01:54:08,691 --> 01:54:11,150
perception of what we want from,
from women

1971
01:54:11,590 --> 01:54:14,750
maybe. Um, I, I see what
you're saying. Um, I, I, I'm,

1972
01:54:14,770 --> 01:54:17,470
I'm sure I would see it from a
completely different perspective.

1973
01:54:17,471 --> 01:54:20,200
If I was you and I lived your experiences.

1974
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:24,790
My experience though with friends and
people that I care about is, you know,

1975
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:26,620
I don't always agree with Jerry Seinfeld,

1976
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:29,860
but one thing that Jerry Seinfeld
said that I really do agree with,

1977
01:54:29,861 --> 01:54:33,650
there's someone was talking
about diversity and comedy
and he was like, look, I,

1978
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:37,390
this is all I speak. It's funny, I
just, I want to know what's funny.

1979
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:41,050
Like what I think is our people are
funny if they're men, if they're women,

1980
01:54:41,051 --> 01:54:43,510
if they're black, if they're
white, he goes, I just like funny.

1981
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:47,020
And that's true because Chris rock
is one of his best friends. Um,

1982
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:51,670
w w was the dude who used to host,
um, MTV half hour comedy hour.

1983
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:55,550
Mario Joiner is a guy who's been
a good friend forever. Yeah. Yeah.

1984
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:56,820
But I think he's,

1985
01:54:56,850 --> 01:55:00,930
I think that the conversation was with
Collin Quinn when he was talking about

1986
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:03,360
why he had no women or,

1987
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:07,560
or black people on the first season of
his writing and in cars with comedians

1988
01:55:07,561 --> 01:55:12,420
and, and it's like funny as funny,
but are you looking for, what's fun?

1989
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:17,110
Are you, I don't think
of, um, you know, it.

1990
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:19,950
Do you have your hand on the
pulse of who's it, who's stand up?

1991
01:55:19,951 --> 01:55:23,820
Are you going down to
watch Jerry Seinfeld?

1992
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:26,670
I'm saying that in
general. Like, you know,

1993
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:29,070
you know what's fun and
I think that's true.

1994
01:55:29,071 --> 01:55:31,560
What's funny is funny and like I don't,
I don't,

1995
01:55:31,561 --> 01:55:33,890
I would never specify like this
is my favorite female comic.

1996
01:55:33,891 --> 01:55:37,000
It was my favorite black comic.
Like that's insane to me. Um,

1997
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:41,550
but I think people what they are
looking for, if they're like,

1998
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:44,640
I'm going to Google, um, comedians,

1999
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:49,350
uh, they're good there. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Is that what it's called?

2000
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:52,900
Yes. That's what it is. It's a talk
show, but I don't think so. He does it.

2001
01:55:52,930 --> 01:55:56,920
He interviews people like Larry David,
Eddie Izzard.

2002
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:59,940
Was it him and talking on Stern
about college? Well, it's, he,

2003
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:03,100
he interviews people that he thinks
are interesting. That's all it is.

2004
01:56:03,101 --> 01:56:07,450
I mean he just gets like David Letterman
goes for a drive and his Volvo. Yeah.

2005
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:11,810
And then the second season he had
Sarah on, he had, he had, you know,

2006
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:15,080
he had women on, cause Colin was like,
you're gonna get a lot of shit for this.

2007
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:17,270
But that's not why he did it. Yeah. No,

2008
01:56:17,390 --> 01:56:20,060
I think that's what he's saying when
he said the interview, he's like,

2009
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:23,810
I don't care. Yeah. He goes, all I care
about. It's funny. I think you're right.

2010
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:28,100
That I think I'm like that. You don't
think he's like that? No, I don't know.

2011
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:31,730
I have no idea. I have no idea.
But what I'm saying is, um,

2012
01:56:32,210 --> 01:56:35,930
I think that that's what he
was talking about was Collin.

2013
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:38,150
I'm telling him like you need,
you can't just,

2014
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:39,680
no,
it was actually an interview.

2015
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:43,970
It was an interview where you asking him
in an interview and Sterns, here it is.

2016
01:56:44,330 --> 01:56:45,780
This guy here,
I'll play it.

2017
01:56:46,030 --> 01:56:50,720
Mostly the, the guests are mostly white
males of 22 episodes that get into that.

2018
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:51,803
No.

2019
01:56:54,010 --> 01:56:56,080
Look over here. Peter,
what are you saying?

2020
01:56:59,950 --> 01:57:01,750
What's going on here?

2021
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:08,070
Oh, this really pisses me off,
but God had really pisses me off.

2022
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:09,900
That's okay.
I'm go ahead.

2023
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:13,380
But you made a comment on the Tina Fey
episode that I thought was interesting

2024
01:57:13,381 --> 01:57:15,120
that I'd like to get your
thoughts on a little bit more.

2025
01:57:15,121 --> 01:57:17,120
You said you were talking
to her that the end,

2026
01:57:17,121 --> 01:57:20,070
you said something about
the female comedians.

2027
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:23,370
It's a struggle for them to balance
their feminine projections with their

2028
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:27,370
comedic gold and its context of comedy,
not gender diverse.

2029
01:57:27,371 --> 01:57:29,250
I just want to know what
you meant by that. Well,

2030
01:57:29,251 --> 01:57:34,200
I'm was kind of curious what it's like
to be a woman in comedy as opposed to a

2031
01:57:34,201 --> 01:57:37,050
man. There was a little bit of a
difference and I thought that might be an

2032
01:57:37,051 --> 01:57:41,160
interesting thing to discuss from her
perspective. She saw successful at it,

2033
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:43,200
and I'm just wondering
how she looked at it,

2034
01:57:43,201 --> 01:57:47,760
if she even thought about it and she kind
of gave me the answer, which is, yeah,

2035
01:57:47,761 --> 01:57:49,770
you do have to think about that,
but you know,

2036
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:52,230
it's just another thing to
think about. Okay. All right.

2037
01:57:52,730 --> 01:57:54,430
Yeah. Hold on. A lot

2038
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:57,580
of things about the communities of cars
in the beginning and the first 10 I did,

2039
01:57:57,581 --> 01:58:01,600
I think we're all white males and
people writing all about that, which I,

2040
01:58:01,630 --> 01:58:05,080
part of the reason why people had tweeted
at me when I said I'm interviewing

2041
01:58:05,081 --> 01:58:07,870
with Jerry Seinfeld is okay, ask him about
their agenda. Their diversity on there.

2042
01:58:07,871 --> 01:58:12,020
Yeah. I mean it's, people think it's,
it's the census or something. I mean,

2043
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:17,770
we represent the, the actual
pie chart of, of, of America.

2044
01:58:17,771 --> 01:58:21,520
Who Cares? It's just funny,
you know? Funny is the, is the,

2045
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:25,720
is the world that I live in. You're
funny. I'm interested. You're not funny.

2046
01:58:25,721 --> 01:58:30,721
I'm not interested and I have no interest
in gender or race or anything like

2047
01:58:31,121 --> 01:58:35,080
that, but everyone else gets kind
of with their little calculating,

2048
01:58:35,230 --> 01:58:38,610
is this the exact right mix? You know? Uh,

2049
01:58:38,890 --> 01:58:43,300
I think that's a,
to me it's anti comedy.

2050
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:46,840
It's the anti comedy. It's,
it's more about, you know,

2051
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:51,550
PC nonsense. Okay. Then are you
making us laugh or not? Right, right.

2052
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:56,220
He definitely also talked about that.
What he just sat on stern and,

2053
01:58:56,370 --> 01:58:58,600
but in reference Collins saying
that he was going to get,

2054
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:02,170
get a bunch a bunch of shit about that.
Oh, so he's talked about it a few times.

2055
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:06,550
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but I think, um, uh,

2056
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:10,240
I don't know. I mean you
disagree with them? No,

2057
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:15,340
I think I'm not going to disagree with
the statement. What's funny is funny. I,

2058
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:18,880
I think what somebody thinks is fine.
I don't think you should just have a,

2059
01:59:18,881 --> 01:59:21,290
a woman or a,
um,

2060
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:25,870
a person who's not white on to
not make people upset. Right.

2061
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:30,610
I don't think that's, um, you
know, I have my own feelings about,

2062
01:59:31,570 --> 01:59:36,310
um, like I have my stuff,
my old stuff would,

2063
01:59:36,311 --> 01:59:40,960
that triggers for me is going
back to when I was young,

2064
01:59:40,990 --> 01:59:44,570
like really young in school and,
and,

2065
01:59:44,630 --> 01:59:47,050
and being funny and having,
but,

2066
01:59:47,051 --> 01:59:52,051
but knowing and getting a reaction from
people like just try to be like nice and

2067
01:59:53,411 --> 01:59:57,730
pretty like, that's what we want from
you. Like be a girl. Like shut up.

2068
01:59:57,910 --> 02:00:02,680
The boys are talking, we're
funny. And knowing I was funnier.

2069
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:04,481
Wait a minute.

2070
02:00:04,481 --> 02:00:08,470
Why does that him saying that he doesn't
believe in anything but funny trigger

2071
02:00:08,471 --> 02:00:09,304
that in you?

2072
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:14,580
Because I don't believe that
that he's aware are looking.

2073
02:00:14,891 --> 02:00:18,760
I think,
I think that um,

2074
02:00:19,930 --> 02:00:24,930
I think that maybe he would be more likely
to dismiss someone or not really pay

2075
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:29,620
that much attention to um,

2076
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:36,610
to something other than what he's
used to thinking is, is funny.

2077
02:00:36,611 --> 02:00:38,830
Like it like it being like a white,

2078
02:00:39,290 --> 02:00:42,490
if your favorite comedians that people
you want to have on the first season of

2079
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:43,473
your show,

2080
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:48,810
your first 10 episodes are all one
type then then that's your type.

2081
02:00:52,031 --> 02:00:54,550
And I don't think that you can say
what I don't think you can say.

2082
02:00:54,551 --> 02:00:57,400
What's funny is funny because
there are plenty of comedians.

2083
02:00:57,401 --> 02:01:02,200
I go up there and kill and
I'm like nothing, you know,

2084
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:05,350
and like Chris Rock, I think I said this
on here last time, but he told me like,

2085
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:09,010
I was like, how was, how was his sat? And
he'll be like, he killed. I'm like, yeah,

2086
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:11,380
but how was it? And he's
like, no, respect the kill.

2087
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:16,730
And like I was just talking about this
with Wanda Sykes. She was like, yes,

2088
02:01:16,731 --> 02:01:21,070
sometimes you can't. And I'm like,
yeah, sometimes you can't. So it's like,

2089
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:25,960
okay, what's funny is funny. What? What
makes what makes a room full of people,

2090
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:31,150
you know? Tears laughing. You can say,
well that's, they're laughing. It's funny.

2091
02:01:31,870 --> 02:01:35,620
But to you it's not. It's not funny,
but it's not up to you. But I'm,

2092
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:39,010
I can't tell you what's funny and what's
not like I don't think anyone can say

2093
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:40,610
funny is funny actually

2094
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,710
because it's subjective.
It's subjective. Right?

2095
02:01:42,711 --> 02:01:44,780
But you say what's funny to
you and that is what's funny.

2096
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:48,590
I mean when you're saying to him is
his who he chose to having a show.

2097
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:49,790
I totally understand that,

2098
02:01:49,791 --> 02:01:54,590
but I don't understand why you connected
to your personal feelings on people

2099
02:01:54,591 --> 02:01:59,591
saying that we weren't saying that you
weren't funny and you were a girl and

2100
02:01:59,811 --> 02:02:02,680
that you were actually fun. It
wasn't fun. They were saying, well,

2101
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:04,010
they wanted you to be quiet.

2102
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:07,640
They wanted you to be quiet and they
wanted the guys to be talking and you were

2103
02:02:07,641 --> 02:02:12,550
funnier than the God. As a person with
a personality was like dismissed. Like,

2104
02:02:12,551 --> 02:02:15,500
you're right, we will come get
the girls like when we need them.

2105
02:02:15,530 --> 02:02:19,850
I understand you from you
personally, but him. Why does that,

2106
02:02:19,851 --> 02:02:24,851
his statement had zero to do with gender
or race wasn't a gender or race because

2107
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:30,620
he was saying very clearly he doesn't
care. As long as you're funny,

2108
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:33,730
that's what he shares. You can make
a statement. What's funny is funny.

2109
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:37,280
I mean like that's so
easy to say like you just,

2110
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:41,420
that's such a like, I don't care. You
can just say, I don't care what's,

2111
02:02:41,421 --> 02:02:45,260
what's funny is funny. So you're
accusing him of being dishonest. No,

2112
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:49,900
I think that that is absolutely what
he means is I'm so confused. I don't,

2113
02:02:49,901 --> 02:02:52,390
I love you. I don't want to get into
an argument with you about that.

2114
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,570
We're in an argument. Okay, good. I
want, I want you to understand too,

2115
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:02,440
what I'm saying is I believe
that he believes what he's
saying and I hear saying

2116
02:03:03,651 --> 02:03:07,850
he discriminates in some way because of
his choices and that his choices should

2117
02:03:07,851 --> 02:03:11,480
reflect a broader range
of human beings just to,

2118
02:03:11,530 --> 02:03:16,130
I don't think I would never use like
the word should with what Jerry Seinfeld

2119
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:20,720
should be watching. So tell me
how his choices bring up in you,

2120
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:25,100
this idea that you personally
discriminated against.

2121
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:30,130
Because I think to say what's
funny is funny is like,

2122
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:33,980
I don't think that's true.
Um,

2123
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:38,450
because because comedy is so subjective,
like somebody gets to him. Right?

2124
02:03:38,451 --> 02:03:42,680
But wait, let me, let me
work through this. Um, but,

2125
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:47,390
but that's the thing. What's
funny is funny to me. It's like,

2126
02:03:48,290 --> 02:03:52,160
um, so, but, but he didn't,
I don't think he said that.

2127
02:03:52,161 --> 02:03:56,120
I think he said what's funny is funny,
not what appeals interested.

2128
02:03:56,830 --> 02:04:00,380
He said the language I speak is funny.
All I'm interested in is if you're funny.

2129
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,810
That's what he said.
Right? So saying that,

2130
02:04:02,811 --> 02:04:07,190
but then also choosing
10 white male comics, um,

2131
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:11,810
for the first season of his
show. He's saying like, sorry,

2132
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:14,980
if you guys were funnier,
um,

2133
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:17,390
other races and weight and women,

2134
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:21,290
then you would have been on the first
season of my show. And I'm saying,

2135
02:04:21,291 --> 02:04:23,870
I don't think that he's seen,

2136
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:29,000
I don't think that he's as open
to seeing people other than that,

2137
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:30,380
that prototype.

2138
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:35,920
And that is what connects me
to my childhood stuff because

2139
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:39,990
people are used to,

2140
02:04:39,991 --> 02:04:43,020
this is who I'm used to being
funny people who look like this,

2141
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:47,360
people who do this. And, and so
that's, that's why I'm connecting it.

2142
02:04:47,570 --> 02:04:49,520
I understand. I understand
what you're saying. Um,

2143
02:04:49,521 --> 02:04:54,470
I think you're adding a lot of extra
stuff to what he's saying and I think

2144
02:04:54,471 --> 02:04:58,640
you're also not taking into consideration
the idea that this is his individual

2145
02:04:58,940 --> 02:04:59,773
creation,

2146
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:03,890
this idea of a web show and that he has
probably dozens and dozens of friends.

2147
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:08,060
If he's doing 10 episodes and he has
dozens of the greatest comedians in the

2148
02:05:08,061 --> 02:05:13,040
world, I don't think that it should
be up to him to diversify his,

2149
02:05:13,041 --> 02:05:17,720
his cast. So then what he said is
essentially, I'm interested in,

2150
02:05:17,810 --> 02:05:20,810
are people funny? If you're funny,
that's what I'm interested in. To him.

2151
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:24,440
That's a true statement.
It may be very well suggest subjective.

2152
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:27,200
You might think that some of those
people are not funny, whereas you know,

2153
02:05:27,230 --> 02:05:30,920
there's people that think that a
perfect example is Gilbert Godfried.

2154
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:34,390
This people that think
that Gilbert Godfrey's the
funniest dude to ever walk for

2155
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:36,610
case.
Not every comedian I know.

2156
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:39,750
No, no, no. What I'm saying is every
comedian, okay, you can say, well,

2157
02:05:39,751 --> 02:05:43,200
this guy's hilarious. And then someone
else will say, and I don't like it. When,

2158
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:46,860
when I would never say any comedians.
Not Funny. Like you could just know, oh,

2159
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:51,400
he's not funny. It's like, no, you
don't think he's funny. Exactly.

2160
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:54,340
It's like everything else.
Music, it's like movies.

2161
02:05:54,341 --> 02:05:56,110
It's like anything else I don't want,

2162
02:05:56,170 --> 02:06:00,940
I don't think Seinfeld should have done
anything different and I don't, um,

2163
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:05,560
I don't, I don't think that he should have
to, I think he wants to make the show.

2164
02:06:05,570 --> 02:06:07,630
He should make it with the
people you want. Just like the,

2165
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:10,570
like girls that show got a bunch of
shit for just having white people on,

2166
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:15,310
like let them make the show that
they want. Right. But I'm allowed to,

2167
02:06:15,490 --> 02:06:20,490
that's allowed to trigger something in
me that I can feel like his choice to not

2168
02:06:20,711 --> 02:06:22,570
do that.
Even though he's every right.

2169
02:06:22,571 --> 02:06:24,460
And I think you should make
the show you want to make.

2170
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:28,650
That does trigger something
in me. I don't, it's not that.

2171
02:06:29,890 --> 02:06:31,690
Do you feel it's fair?
Does it make sense,

2172
02:06:31,691 --> 02:06:35,660
objective when you analyze your
feelings inside of you? No. No,

2173
02:06:36,690 --> 02:06:39,390
you don't validate them.
You don't try to justify them there.

2174
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:43,550
I understand that I have a
right to my feelings about it.

2175
02:06:43,790 --> 02:06:45,970
I don't think they're right or wrong.
Okay.

2176
02:06:46,190 --> 02:06:50,300
And I think all day long we're
triggered by, by people or interactions.

2177
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:53,990
It's like why you yell at a a
bank teller? It's like, wait,

2178
02:06:53,991 --> 02:06:56,390
why did I tell her I don't go to a bank,
I have a businessman,

2179
02:06:58,010 --> 02:07:00,050
but do you know what I
mean? It's like, you know,

2180
02:07:00,051 --> 02:07:02,600
somebody triggers something in
you and it brings up old stuff.

2181
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:05,600
And I think Seinfeld so funny.
I really like him.

2182
02:07:05,630 --> 02:07:10,040
I see him on him at the
cellar and I, but, but um,

2183
02:07:10,070 --> 02:07:13,910
seeing that hearing I'm talking
about Alan Stern, it, it brings up,

2184
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:17,930
it does bring that up for me and I don't,
I don't think that a,

2185
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:20,860
and I understand why it doesn't
make sense to you. Well know.

2186
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:24,570
I'm not saying that doesn't make sense.
Your feelings absolutely makes sense.

2187
02:07:24,930 --> 02:07:29,730
You know, we might disagree
with whether or not it's valid,

2188
02:07:29,731 --> 02:07:31,500
but you seem to think
that it's not even valid.

2189
02:07:31,501 --> 02:07:35,170
That it's just reality and just these are
feelings that are brought up and these

2190
02:07:35,171 --> 02:07:36,310
are your feelings and you don't,

2191
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:40,050
you don't justify them or rationalize
them in any way. Just being honest.

2192
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:45,440
I think it makes perfect sense for
why that would trigger that in me.

2193
02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:48,850
Right. But as long as you don't
hold them responsible for that,

2194
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:52,420
I don't think he should do anything
different. Some people do though.

2195
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:55,660
There's a lot of, well that's good.
You have a very healthy attitude.

2196
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:56,820
I mean, I really don't, I think,

2197
02:07:56,821 --> 02:08:01,821
but I think what's saying like
what's funny is funny is it,

2198
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:06,600
I think that statement should, and maybe
you did it and I just didn't catch it,

2199
02:08:06,601 --> 02:08:09,780
but it should include what, what's
funny to me. It's funny to me because

2200
02:08:11,330 --> 02:08:15,130
it was funny. It's funny, he does implied,
you know, he's saying my interest is,

2201
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:16,300
I'm interested in what's funny.

2202
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,410
Speak with like a lot of
authority about a lot of,

2203
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:27,480
um, things. I and I, I don't know, I've
never heard him say this, but I think,

2204
02:08:27,690 --> 02:08:32,690
I think some people can act like they are
the decider of what's funny and what's

2205
02:08:34,531 --> 02:08:38,130
not. And I don't think, and
I've, you know, I've had a great,

2206
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:40,410
I've had a great reaction.

2207
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:45,210
Like I feel very lucky and like work has
paid off and people come to see me and

2208
02:08:45,211 --> 02:08:48,930
I make people laugh I think.
But um, if someone's like,

2209
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:53,580
I don't like your standup, I'm like,
sure. If they're like, you're not funny.

2210
02:08:53,581 --> 02:08:56,310
I'm like, no, that's not true.

2211
02:08:56,710 --> 02:08:59,290
Right. Okay. I get all that personal shit.

2212
02:08:59,291 --> 02:09:03,610
But I think you might be applying it
in this situation in a way that's like,

2213
02:09:03,611 --> 02:09:06,500
you're adding a bunch of stuff
to what he said. You know,

2214
02:09:06,501 --> 02:09:09,580
I really think you have to take
it. He said, well this, this,

2215
02:09:09,581 --> 02:09:13,570
the feelings like this connecting
it to him saying that, you know,

2216
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:15,710
or him being some sort of
an arbitrary of what's,

2217
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:19,780
you know what I should add into
the mix here? Your pms in no,

2218
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:24,370
no, but again, that is
something that nature creates.

2219
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:28,360
It's not my fault that
we're punished for like,

2220
02:09:28,450 --> 02:09:32,740
why are you being crazy? Like, do you
think I want to feel crazy? Am I like,

2221
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:37,510
Ooh, can I please link, bleed
once a month and feel insane?

2222
02:09:37,511 --> 02:09:41,530
Cause that's what I want. No.
And I think I might be pms.

2223
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:46,150
No, but I also, you know,

2224
02:09:46,151 --> 02:09:50,140
I've been past it that I've been working
at the comedy cellar for seven years

2225
02:09:50,141 --> 02:09:54,220
now and been a standard for 10.

2226
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:58,290
And I also, um, you know, I,

2227
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:02,050
I've interactions with,
with Seinfeld once in a while.

2228
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:06,400
And so this isn't just
me seeing the comedian,

2229
02:10:06,401 --> 02:10:09,690
Jerry Seinfeld has a television,
has a,

2230
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:14,230
a web series and you didn't use it.
I'm not just reading these headlines.

2231
02:10:14,231 --> 02:10:18,040
I also have like, you know, um,

2232
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:21,370
personal experiences with him that leads
you to believe you thinks in a certain

2233
02:10:21,371 --> 02:10:22,204
way.

2234
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:26,440
No. Just like, and you
know what these are,

2235
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:31,030
I'm sure they're unfounded.
What they charge, what they
trigger and in me, but you,

2236
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:33,230
you can't help that stuff. People
do it to me all day. I know.

2237
02:10:33,231 --> 02:10:38,060
I look like I look like somebody
you went to high school with that,

2238
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:41,770
that like was annoying or
a bitch or something. And
then, and people just don't,

2239
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:45,620
Eh, and you're like, that's not, it's
not my fault, but you're not wrong.

2240
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:51,500
You know, so, so yeah. So when I see
that video and what's funny is funny,

2241
02:10:51,501 --> 02:10:56,350
I do feel like, kind of
like he's dismissing, um,

2242
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:59,360
not by the,
not by the choice to,

2243
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:03,650
to just use white male comics in
the first season of your show. Like,

2244
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:07,580
do your thing, do whatever
you want. Of course. But, um,

2245
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:12,530
but it, you know, it does, it
does bring up feelings in me,

2246
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:14,060
which that's okay.

2247
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:18,250
Yeah. I mean, as long as you're
not blaming him and you are,

2248
02:11:18,251 --> 02:11:20,060
you just doing it as being
honest about your feelings.

2249
02:11:20,061 --> 02:11:23,360
And sometimes people trigger
feelings in people unintentionally.

2250
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:26,690
I'm not blaming him for anything. Things
are going well. Like I of course not.

2251
02:11:26,730 --> 02:11:29,150
I'm saying that it doesn't mean
that those feelings are invalid.

2252
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:31,250
If something triggers those feelings,

2253
02:11:31,251 --> 02:11:35,900
it doesn't mean that this look life
triggers shit in people. You know,

2254
02:11:36,060 --> 02:11:40,220
you watch an eagle snatch a fon
and, and fly off with it. Oh,

2255
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:44,150
you might freak out. But guess what? It's
tough shit. People don't, people will

2256
02:11:44,370 --> 02:11:47,520
collage out of me like a girl.
When I was opening for a towel,

2257
02:11:47,521 --> 02:11:49,710
she would write to me like,
I know you're having sex them.

2258
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:51,180
It was like,
ah,

2259
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:54,990
he's my friend and I opened her as
the girl that Intel was a dating.

2260
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:57,880
I don't think so. Just
tell fan. And it was like,

2261
02:11:57,881 --> 02:12:00,420
I know like she had created this
whole thing and I people reach out.

2262
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:04,010
That was made by the way under
tell fucking,

2263
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:08,900
but when people like are mad about
something like that, you know, I,

2264
02:12:08,910 --> 02:12:12,520
I would like right, like, or I would just
think like, I hope she's okay. You know,

2265
02:12:12,521 --> 02:12:14,150
like, this isn't for, you know,

2266
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:17,740
I'd hope to get hit in the head by
a fucking media how many people,

2267
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:19,920
but I'm just like,
you know,

2268
02:12:20,290 --> 02:12:24,280
people like will feel real strong about
things that make no sense or they have

2269
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:28,630
sort of no business. Um, like it does it.
Yeah. Just like, doesn't make any sense,

2270
02:12:28,631 --> 02:12:32,780
but it's like, so you feel that
way and that's okay. I think.

2271
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:34,540
I think he's obviously,

2272
02:12:34,541 --> 02:12:39,040
he's an amazing comic and made it one
of my favorite television shows ever.

2273
02:12:39,070 --> 02:12:43,960
And um, and it, it does
it and it's allowed to,

2274
02:12:44,020 --> 02:12:46,130
it's allowed to trigger
something in me that he thought,

2275
02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:50,300
I mean, you're, you're also trying to
dance around your words and be, you know,

2276
02:12:50,301 --> 02:12:52,760
very fair about all this.
It's a very tricky subject.

2277
02:12:52,761 --> 02:12:56,270
It's a bold one to sort of take on.
I worked with these people. Yeah. No,

2278
02:12:56,271 --> 02:12:58,570
I know what you're saying. I
know what you're saying. I'm,

2279
02:12:58,580 --> 02:13:01,780
and I'm glad you don't think that.
I think in that way at all. I tried.

2280
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:05,110
I think it triggers something in you
that cause you're mad that people were

2281
02:13:05,580 --> 02:13:08,140
never had a hard time. Yeah.
So what, what, what was that?

2282
02:13:08,350 --> 02:13:11,860
Because I don't think that you should
be forced to hang around with anybody

2283
02:13:11,861 --> 02:13:14,380
other than the people that you
choose to hang around with,

2284
02:13:14,381 --> 02:13:18,100
whether it's cast them on
your own television show
or whether it's put them on

2285
02:13:18,101 --> 02:13:21,400
your podcast or whether it's go
with on the road with them. Yeah,

2286
02:13:22,150 --> 02:13:23,980
it's stupid.
I don't think you should have to,

2287
02:13:23,981 --> 02:13:27,830
but I don't love that he didn't
naturally want to do that and I'm,

2288
02:13:27,831 --> 02:13:29,680
I'm allowed to feel that way naturally.

2289
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:32,000
Wanting to do something
doesn't mean I don't

2290
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:35,050
think you had enough choices
like let's say then that,

2291
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:36,480
I mean that's a different conversation,

2292
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:40,620
the whole conversation because
there's only 10 spots. I mean,

2293
02:13:40,621 --> 02:13:44,970
how many people does he love that are in
those 10 spots and why do one or two of

2294
02:13:44,971 --> 02:13:48,240
them have to be women who was on the
first season? I don't know. I don't know.

2295
02:13:49,290 --> 02:13:53,940
I have no idea. I really have only watched
two of them. I watched the one with, um,

2296
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:59,130
not Eddie Izzard. What's
homeboy? Um, Eddie,

2297
02:13:59,131 --> 02:14:04,090
the other ready, other English Eddie.
God dammit. Famous guy. Not Eddie Izzard,

2298
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:07,140
the other one. Eddie Murphy.
Of course. English guy.

2299
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:09,180
What the fuck is his name?

2300
02:14:11,690 --> 02:14:14,070
Who was that other famous English guy?

2301
02:14:14,190 --> 02:14:16,740
That fucking other comedian
that's on all the time.

2302
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:19,800
He must be one of the 10 funniest Jamie,

2303
02:14:20,050 --> 02:14:23,100
who's the other guy was on opie and
Anthony with them. Jesus fucking Christ.

2304
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:27,780
I can't believe I can't remember
his name. Oh my God. Come on.

2305
02:14:27,781 --> 02:14:31,080
He's one of the 10 funniest people alive.
Thank you Ricky.

2306
02:14:31,081 --> 02:14:35,250
Gervais' fucking Christ.
Thank you very much.

2307
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:39,860
Amy Schumer sister comes in the
clutch. I can't believe it. Sorry Rick.

2308
02:14:39,861 --> 02:14:42,070
And you're ready. Sorry. I was,

2309
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:46,120
I was so blown away by Eddie Izzard
accomplishment of running a thousand miles

2310
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:50,560
in steaming my brain. The
office? No, his, his um,

2311
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:53,130
comedians in cars getting coffee.
Is that what you're asking? Okay,

2312
02:14:53,131 --> 02:14:58,110
so he did 10 funniest Reiki. I the only
one. I saw it, I started Ricky your vase.

2313
02:14:58,111 --> 02:15:01,200
And I saw Letterman. Those are the two
that I've seen. He's had a bunch of them.

2314
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:05,400
Alec Baldwin, Larry,
Larry, David, Brian Regan.

2315
02:15:05,610 --> 02:15:08,340
He had a bunch of his friends. I mean
that's really essentially what he had.

2316
02:15:08,341 --> 02:15:11,740
He had 10 of his friends and they
happened to be all white guys. Yeah.

2317
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:16,560
I think that triggers Chris Rock was on
there too though. Was that season one?

2318
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:19,010
Season two.
Chris Rock was on season two

2319
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:23,880
and then there's Louis
C K in there and uh,

2320
02:15:24,660 --> 02:15:29,280
Sarah Silvermans in there and see
these are the, what's funny is funny,

2321
02:15:29,281 --> 02:15:31,200
the 10 Michael Richards,
Karl Rahner,

2322
02:15:31,201 --> 02:15:34,950
Mel Brooks can't argue that whenever
Collin Quinn and Mario Joiner,

2323
02:15:34,951 --> 02:15:39,870
there's a black card, by the
way, Mario joinders, you know,

2324
02:15:39,990 --> 02:15:42,420
he's a good friend of his
and hilarious comedian. Look,

2325
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:44,880
I don't think he's having
meetings and I just, he's,

2326
02:15:44,881 --> 02:15:47,580
he's putting the ball on that he thinks
is funny. Those are the people he got,

2327
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:52,520
you know, I don't know. I can
see what you're saying and I,

2328
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:57,770
but I don't think you're dealing with
somebody on my show because I thought they

2329
02:15:58,231 --> 02:16:01,850
filled like, of course some
diversity count. You know, like,

2330
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:05,880
I think everybody should be able
to do, have whatever. If you,

2331
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:10,320
if you never had girls ever on
your podcast, that's your choice.

2332
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:15,270
And I would have feelings about it and
not because you should have to have them

2333
02:16:15,271 --> 02:16:19,590
because I like, I love that you love
women and think women are funny.

2334
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:23,190
That's not how all of them though.
I like the funny ones.

2335
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:30,010
That's the men.
There are still men who

2336
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:34,240
are just like the women in the
clubs. I swear it, that's still,

2337
02:16:35,410 --> 02:16:36,580
that's still a thing.
Yeah.

2338
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,700
Well I, and I don't think that
Seinfeld even feels that way.

2339
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:42,970
I was going back to what I was saying
about Judy gold is that the conversation

2340
02:16:42,971 --> 02:16:44,140
that we had about,
um,

2341
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:47,710
this interview that I did was what I was
trying to say in the interview, was it,

2342
02:16:47,711 --> 02:16:50,260
I think it's,
it's a way more difficult proposition.

2343
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:55,420
Not saying that women can't be
funnier or better or you know,

2344
02:16:55,421 --> 02:16:58,150
more clever,
but I think that starting out,

2345
02:16:58,690 --> 02:17:02,050
there's reactions that a lot of people
have that are prejudice against women.

2346
02:17:02,051 --> 02:17:04,900
They don't necessarily have against men.
When a woman goes on stage,

2347
02:17:04,901 --> 02:17:08,710
I feel like she's a point behind
at least one, you know, right away,

2348
02:17:08,711 --> 02:17:13,630
especially if she goes on stage and she
has any sort of opinions about politics

2349
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:16,180
or sexuality or anything.
I mean,

2350
02:17:16,181 --> 02:17:21,181
a lot of times women are forced in a
lot of ways to be self deprecating at a

2351
02:17:22,001 --> 02:17:25,270
level that a man isn't just
to sort of get in the door.

2352
02:17:25,370 --> 02:17:25,581
Well,

2353
02:17:25,581 --> 02:17:29,330
a guy doesn't want to listen to you
unless he thinks he could definitely fuck

2354
02:17:29,331 --> 02:17:30,164
you.

2355
02:17:31,170 --> 02:17:32,970
There's that.
Maybe for some people.

2356
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,490
Well, I don't want to, I don't even
believe that. I don't even believe that,

2357
02:17:35,491 --> 02:17:39,390
but some guys, yeah. But, um,

2358
02:17:41,070 --> 02:17:45,630
I think, uh, I think Judy's
hilarious. I think, you know,

2359
02:17:47,130 --> 02:17:51,990
you know, I, I'm not like, I'm looking,

2360
02:17:51,991 --> 02:17:56,991
I'm looking at you and we're having this
conversation and I think like men are,

2361
02:17:59,700 --> 02:18:01,740
are all triggered by women
in general because it's like,

2362
02:18:01,741 --> 02:18:03,320
who's the woman you've known the longest?

2363
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:07,830
Your mom and when she would talk to women
in general, I think when women taught,

2364
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:12,720
yeah. When, when, when like a
woman is talking longer than
like, it can, it can just,

2365
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:13,770
yeah,

2366
02:18:13,770 --> 02:18:15,490
I think it can.
I want a man's talking longer.

2367
02:18:15,510 --> 02:18:18,630
You want to beat the shit out of him as
a completely different reaction. Really.

2368
02:18:18,930 --> 02:18:22,520
Oh, and men are talking too long. You'd
like, dude, shut the fuck up. It's uh,

2369
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:27,180
it's an uh, aggressively assaulting
on your senses sort of thing.

2370
02:18:27,181 --> 02:18:32,020
When a guy is like overbearing and
talks too much, men get angry. You know,

2371
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:34,590
men might get bored if it wasn't,
everybody gets bored.

2372
02:18:34,591 --> 02:18:36,840
If anybody has shitty social cues,

2373
02:18:37,140 --> 02:18:40,620
if they're boring and monotonous and self
obsessed and they don't understand the

2374
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:42,900
ins and the outs of a conversation,

2375
02:18:42,901 --> 02:18:46,140
the ebb and flow of two people
enjoying each other's company.

2376
02:18:46,141 --> 02:18:49,290
If one person just yapping at you like
I'm doing right now, just yapping at you.

2377
02:18:49,291 --> 02:18:52,110
I'm not even letting you talk.
No. You know what I'm saying?

2378
02:18:52,410 --> 02:18:55,980
I think you're right.
I think when you go on a stage as a woman,

2379
02:18:56,760 --> 02:19:00,180
when you start out, you have a strike
against you. Yes. More than one.

2380
02:19:00,181 --> 02:19:01,740
I think I have enjoyed that strike.

2381
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:06,770
I kind of miss it because it was
really fun to go up there and surprise

2382
02:19:07,590 --> 02:19:08,910
everybody.
It still is.

2383
02:19:09,070 --> 02:19:11,200
Right. So like your first
joke, you get off, boom,

2384
02:19:11,201 --> 02:19:14,160
they start laughing and just
feel the tension, leave the room

2385
02:19:14,310 --> 02:19:16,170
and then you're like, yeah. And Yeah.

2386
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:20,370
Then they have the other confidence
when I got eliminated from last comic

2387
02:19:20,371 --> 02:19:24,570
standing because I, I just, um, they're
bringing that show back. How dare they,

2388
02:19:24,610 --> 02:19:27,740
I know. And uh, and they mostly, uh,

2389
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:32,540
JB smooth. Oh really? Yeah.
And He owes the last ones.

2390
02:19:33,050 --> 02:19:38,030
No, Jb Smith is fucking hilarious.
I got a great story about him,

2391
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:43,040
but they showed me a clip,
one of my worst bombings ever following.

2392
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:46,670
Oh, I went on before
him. Oh God. Oh my God.

2393
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:49,580
He was supposed to go on first and
I was supposed to go on second.

2394
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:53,150
We were working together in New Jersey
and he got lost. I got lost too.

2395
02:19:53,180 --> 02:19:54,420
It was a really hard place to find.

2396
02:19:54,421 --> 02:19:58,010
There was some weird fucking
college in New Jersey. So, um,

2397
02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:00,660
the for the show was already
like 20 minutes late and they,

2398
02:20:00,690 --> 02:20:03,890
Jamie's not here and I got there late
and they said we're going to wait for him

2399
02:20:03,891 --> 02:20:05,870
to come much,
just have a seat in the rec room.

2400
02:20:05,871 --> 02:20:10,310
So I sit down on the record when I start
watching this documentary on the Malibu

2401
02:20:10,310 --> 02:20:12,800
Fires and Oh my God,

2402
02:20:12,801 --> 02:20:17,801
is it depressing people who lost their
homes and this kid was calling out for

2403
02:20:17,961 --> 02:20:18,890
their dog.

2404
02:20:18,890 --> 02:20:23,240
They were hoping their dog made it and
they're walking smoldering fucking embers

2405
02:20:23,241 --> 02:20:26,570
of their house and they're
walking around rusty. Well,

2406
02:20:26,571 --> 02:20:30,050
you rusty the calling out for a dog and
then this guy comes down and he was a

2407
02:20:30,051 --> 02:20:33,920
fireman and he didn't even lose his house.
They saved his house,

2408
02:20:33,921 --> 02:20:38,000
but his neighbors lost her
house. And this guy was, we bing,

2409
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:39,830
I mean openly weeping.

2410
02:20:39,831 --> 02:20:44,540
He was talking about how this house is
all he has and that he saved for 40 years

2411
02:20:44,541 --> 02:20:48,500
to build this house and this was his house
and he was so worried that he's going

2412
02:20:48,501 --> 02:20:52,880
to lose his house and he feels bad that
he's happy that he kept his house cause

2413
02:20:52,881 --> 02:20:57,560
his neighbors lost their house and he's
fucking crying and weeping and they go,

2414
02:20:57,770 --> 02:20:58,041
okay,

2415
02:20:58,041 --> 02:21:02,000
JB smooth is still not here so we're going
to have you go on stage so can you go

2416
02:21:02,001 --> 02:21:04,820
on stage now? And I was
like, yeah, okay, okay, yeah,

2417
02:21:04,821 --> 02:21:09,200
let me just get a water and I'll go on
stage. And I just went on stage and just,

2418
02:21:09,580 --> 02:21:14,540
I ate the shit buffet of my life and
my girlfriend was with me, you know,

2419
02:21:14,541 --> 02:21:18,170
and I tried to explain it to her why,
but she had seen me doing well before,

2420
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:20,840
but I try to explain to her like I go,
there's no,

2421
02:21:20,841 --> 02:21:23,960
I was just not going to do good.
There's no way I would do good. I just,

2422
02:21:23,961 --> 02:21:25,490
it was horrible,
horrible experience.

2423
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:30,440
So I went up there and just ate politesse
of Shit and then JB smooth shows up

2424
02:21:30,441 --> 02:21:35,441
after me and destroys just levels the
place and they were so happy to see him

2425
02:21:36,471 --> 02:21:39,920
because I was so terrible. Oh,
that's awful. And they were like,

2426
02:21:39,921 --> 02:21:43,910
he was really funny at
neck. I swear. He's funny.

2427
02:21:43,911 --> 02:21:47,030
Like I'd hear them talking when I
got off stage about how bad I was.

2428
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:50,150
Like the people that booked it, they were
like trying to say at the convention.

2429
02:21:50,151 --> 02:21:54,770
He was very funny, was really funny and
just why we bought him. And then I go,

2430
02:21:54,771 --> 02:21:57,950
I'm sorry I watched that thing on the
fires. They go, why'd you do that?

2431
02:21:58,310 --> 02:22:01,520
And I'm like, you fucking sat me in that
room with the TV that was on. I didn't,

2432
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:04,520
didn't flip the channel to that shit.
That's just was on.

2433
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:08,240
I learned a lesson though.
He's valuable.

2434
02:22:08,241 --> 02:22:11,600
What you have in your mind right
before you go on stage. Very, very,

2435
02:22:11,601 --> 02:22:12,434
very important.

2436
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:17,030
I've done it more than one times where
I've gone on stage after seeing something

2437
02:22:17,031 --> 02:22:20,030
awful. Let's just catch this
while they're introducing,

2438
02:22:20,031 --> 02:22:23,720
you read a book about the Kennedy
assassination once all day.

2439
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:26,310
Read this book all day for like 10 hours

2440
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:30,570
and then went on stage and
just eight deck. Just thomp.

2441
02:22:30,571 --> 02:22:33,600
Thomp thomp thomp thomp just
couldn't be fine. I was like,

2442
02:22:33,601 --> 02:22:36,180
take your fucking killed Kennedy.
They fucking killed Kennedy. Okay.

2443
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:38,310
The Catholic was empty.
Okay.

2444
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:41,910
There's a different in the autopsy report
for fucking rant and to anybody who to

2445
02:22:41,911 --> 02:22:42,600
listen to me.

2446
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:46,560
Now you're just listening to the eye
of the tiger watching home alone. No,

2447
02:22:46,561 --> 02:22:49,710
now I just try to be relaxed and have fun.
I try.

2448
02:22:49,711 --> 02:22:52,440
I have a bunch of different
songs that I like to listen to.

2449
02:22:52,970 --> 02:22:57,120
I like to listen to like fun music,
you know, and have my friends around,

2450
02:22:57,121 --> 02:23:01,410
but no negativity and just I got know
even if something negative happens,

2451
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:04,500
good energy. Yeah. Not Getting in there.

2452
02:23:04,501 --> 02:23:07,680
I gotta go see you giggle
all the way out of there.

2453
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:11,130
More rocks and fucking tortures
are being thrown my way.

2454
02:23:11,410 --> 02:23:14,130
He got to know what to let
in and what not to let it in.

2455
02:23:14,131 --> 02:23:16,350
Right before you go onstage.
Super important,

2456
02:23:16,590 --> 02:23:19,230
especially when people pay to see you,
you know,

2457
02:23:19,231 --> 02:23:23,220
someone's going out there to see Amy
Schumer, you can't go on stage. Yeah.

2458
02:23:23,221 --> 02:23:27,870
I tried to do the best I've
ever done every time. That's
huge. That's everything.

2459
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:31,410
I mean, that's what endears you to
fans. There's no other way around it.

2460
02:23:31,411 --> 02:23:34,050
And you remember what it was like
when you were a fan? You know,

2461
02:23:34,051 --> 02:23:37,620
Bill Burr was on the podcast and
he said it best and you know,

2462
02:23:37,621 --> 02:23:41,160
and sort of his own bill burr
type language. He goes, I
remember when I was a kid,

2463
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:44,100
I go see a band. And uh,
and he goes see him, uh,

2464
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:47,360
a year later and they fucking phone
it in and they just, they fuck,

2465
02:23:48,020 --> 02:23:51,330
I never forgot, you know, and I
just, uh, I make a deal with people.

2466
02:23:51,330 --> 02:23:54,060
I'm not going to fuck you. I'm not going
to five. No, I'm not going to fuck you.

2467
02:23:54,061 --> 02:23:58,590
I'm going to write new jokes.
I'm not going to fuck you.
I'm gonna work on. Yeah.

2468
02:23:59,220 --> 02:24:01,820
But he's a real artist, you know what
I mean? Is it really that guy? He's,

2469
02:24:01,890 --> 02:24:05,940
he's really a great comic. I mean, that's
what he's supposed to do in this life.

2470
02:24:05,941 --> 02:24:07,620
He found the perfect occupation.

2471
02:24:07,621 --> 02:24:10,410
He's fantastic at it and
he's got a real ethic for it.

2472
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:14,280
There's a gang of them right now.
There's, you know, there's guys,

2473
02:24:14,281 --> 02:24:18,060
people that people haven't heard of
like Christina Palicki and Tom Segura is

2474
02:24:18,360 --> 02:24:19,860
gaining steam.
Those guys are getting,

2475
02:24:19,861 --> 02:24:23,550
staying with their podcast is gaining
steam and then there's people that people

2476
02:24:23,551 --> 02:24:25,850
forgot about like a towel.
You know,

2477
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:29,370
I would pay to see them above
everybody else right now.

2478
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:34,380
Meet Stan hope standing up over
everybody. He's my boy. He's so funny.

2479
02:24:34,381 --> 02:24:37,020
Yeah. Well there's a bunch
of great ones right now

2480
02:24:38,670 --> 02:24:42,640
I think is like, I need to see that.
You have to see her. I need to see her.

2481
02:24:42,690 --> 02:24:46,050
Joey Diaz is my all time favorite though.
If I had to choose one comic,

2482
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:49,880
the last set that I ever got to see in
my life before the fucking great media

2483
02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:51,390
lands,
it's Diaz,

2484
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:56,940
Diaz smoking a joint on
stage talking about his balls

2485
02:25:00,030 --> 02:25:04,380
plain right down. Are you enjoying
doing your show? Is it stressful?

2486
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:09,930
It's, yeah, it's a lot of
work, but it's worth it, you
know. But it's a lot of work.

2487
02:25:09,931 --> 02:25:12,930
But the result you're,
you're enjoying the process.

2488
02:25:12,931 --> 02:25:16,080
You're enjoying the process
of making it. Yeah. Awesome.

2489
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:21,040
It's getting great reviews.
It is, it is like, yeah.

2490
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:24,010
Was like,
I'm going to make the show that I think

2491
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:27,510
is really funny and I didn't know if,
if people were going to be into it or not.

2492
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:32,200
There's a lot of darkness on your
show. Like, well, have you met me? Yes,

2493
02:25:32,290 --> 02:25:36,100
yes. Yeah. Well you're happy, dark
person. It's an unusual type of darkness.

2494
02:25:36,101 --> 02:25:40,600
It's not overwhelming. It's
not overbearing. It's the
better word. Yeah. You know,

2495
02:25:40,890 --> 02:25:44,140
it's a fun darkness and to
have fun. But I do, yeah,

2496
02:25:44,141 --> 02:25:46,540
my mind goes dark but it's
not like, yeah, I'm not like,

2497
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:50,890
do you face any resistance like subject
matter wise or like the things you want

2498
02:25:50,891 --> 02:25:55,870
to cover? No, no, I don't think so.
Not really. No. Well that's awesome.

2499
02:25:56,110 --> 02:25:59,260
Yeah. But then it's like a lot of
pressure in here cause they're like, okay,

2500
02:25:59,261 --> 02:26:00,690
the network. Like, no, no,

2501
02:26:00,691 --> 02:26:04,270
it's well they're letting us
like this season we were like,

2502
02:26:04,810 --> 02:26:08,170
we don't think you should be bleeping
the word pussy. And they were like,

2503
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:13,170
all right. We were like, woosh,
don't be a pussy or my pussy. Mm.

2504
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:18,910
Either. Whoa. Big Heavy sexual.
Hmm. Hold on. It's never my buzzy.

2505
02:26:19,210 --> 02:26:23,770
No, it is my pussy. My pussy hurts.
Yeah. That's sexual. This is,

2506
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:28,910
it depends on how you say it.
Yeah. Well that Black Dick,
damn, I'm it. Hers. Right.

2507
02:26:29,950 --> 02:26:32,440
My pussy hurts. Then it's just like, oh,

2508
02:26:32,441 --> 02:26:34,800
she's just talking about her past
and they said yes to that. Yeah.

2509
02:26:34,870 --> 02:26:37,600
It's not believed. And we
were like, what? It's awesome.

2510
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:40,540
Welcome to the Internet
and the Internet exists.

2511
02:26:40,541 --> 02:26:44,140
You can't just fucking pretend those words
aren't being bantered around like one

2512
02:26:44,141 --> 02:26:48,670
of those real cool, bad mitten birds.
Just toss and pussy around these days.

2513
02:26:49,010 --> 02:26:52,780
Different world. I know I am. Yeah.
It's a different world. Right.

2514
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:54,730
Do you know that's all self imposed?

2515
02:26:54,731 --> 02:26:58,390
All their restrictions on
language completely solved.
But I mean people, yeah,

2516
02:26:58,391 --> 02:27:00,130
they're just like scared.
They don't want to lose their job.

2517
02:27:00,131 --> 02:27:01,690
But I really appreciate them doing that.

2518
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:04,910
Well it's not, they lose their job. It's
losing advertising revenue and you're,

2519
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:08,060
the revenue they're getting from you is
you're already a controversial comedian.

2520
02:27:08,061 --> 02:27:11,660
You already tackling, you know,
dangerous subject matter or something.

2521
02:27:12,480 --> 02:27:16,900
Ah, you're throwing it out. I'm all
shit. I see what you're doing. Please.

2522
02:27:16,910 --> 02:27:20,030
Heat ain't funny. It's funny, right.
Whatever. Whatever. And then he is.

2523
02:27:21,570 --> 02:27:25,480
Um, so what about shit?
Shit. Get flies too, right?

2524
02:27:25,630 --> 02:27:27,940
What do you mean you can say bullshit,
right? You could say there's a,

2525
02:27:28,090 --> 02:27:29,890
I heard the phrase tonnage issue.

2526
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:33,250
I think you can say shit like
a couple of times. Oh yeah.

2527
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:38,320
Now if your show airs late at night,
like after a certain time, is it,

2528
02:27:38,321 --> 02:27:40,720
do they have a difference in what
they believe and what they don't?

2529
02:27:40,750 --> 02:27:42,010
Cause I know they do it stand up.

2530
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:47,350
Um, yeah, totally. You can. Yeah. If
there's a lot less bleeps after. Right.

2531
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:50,620
There's subject matter restrictions
though. Even in the unbleached one.

2532
02:27:50,830 --> 02:27:53,350
What's interesting, like they bleeped
some shit out when they aired.

2533
02:27:53,351 --> 02:27:54,910
My standup special,
my last special.

2534
02:27:55,060 --> 02:27:58,780
They bleep some shit out
of the earlier stuff. She,

2535
02:27:58,810 --> 02:28:03,280
they bleeped some shit of the earlier
stuff that they left that they edited out

2536
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:07,000
of the unedited stuff. Yeah. Like they
decided like without the bleeping,

2537
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:11,870
it's just, it's just, yeah. This gay
marriage time machine bit I have, yeah.

2538
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:17,090
Well we, what? I love that you did it. You
did an Atlanta, right? Yeah. Yeah. Why?

2539
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:19,910
Why did you choose Atlanta? I love
Atlanta. I love it. I love it too.

2540
02:28:20,030 --> 02:28:21,980
It's an awesome city.
Yeah. It's one of those

2541
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,810
cities that people don't, they
sleep on it. Sleep on Atlanta.

2542
02:28:24,811 --> 02:28:28,370
Atlanta's a great city and it's, people
are ready to go nuts. They're very,

2543
02:28:28,371 --> 02:28:32,840
it's a very diverse city too. It's a,
it's a lot of diversity in Atlanta.

2544
02:28:32,841 --> 02:28:33,830
There's a lot of,
like,

2545
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:38,480
there's a lot of alternative people as
far as like tattooed up and piercings.

2546
02:28:38,481 --> 02:28:41,480
There's a lot of like real southern
people. There's a lot of black people,

2547
02:28:41,630 --> 02:28:45,170
a lot of black, like um,
people that are professionals.

2548
02:28:45,171 --> 02:28:48,290
Like a lot of black lawyers.
You run into a lot of black more.

2549
02:28:48,291 --> 02:28:53,291
So I think you see more integration of
black and white folks like hanging out

2550
02:28:53,301 --> 02:28:54,950
and partying together.
You know,

2551
02:28:54,951 --> 02:28:57,620
I see that more in Atlanta
than I do almost anywhere.

2552
02:28:57,650 --> 02:29:01,280
And I'm sure racism still exists.
I'm not naive, but I think that I,

2553
02:29:01,370 --> 02:29:05,700
I enjoy the diversity when I go out in
Atlanta. I think it's, uh, you know,

2554
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:08,150
so much so that I've
thought about living there.

2555
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:12,440
It's a lot of nonsense in Atlanta to
Atlanta,

2556
02:29:12,450 --> 02:29:16,390
like celebrities of houses
there. It's not a bad spot. Yeah,

2557
02:29:16,510 --> 02:29:20,690
it's the same vibe there.
Like age, nothing matters.

2558
02:29:20,691 --> 02:29:22,200
Everybody's like just hanging out.
Well,

2559
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:25,010
I think whenever you have people that
are more inclined to be partying,

2560
02:29:25,011 --> 02:29:27,500
you're gonna have people that are more
inclined to be fun, you know? I mean,

2561
02:29:27,501 --> 02:29:29,480
that's just the reality of
the world that we live in.

2562
02:29:29,481 --> 02:29:33,200
And you can pretend to be noble by like
what you were talking about earlier,

2563
02:29:33,210 --> 02:29:37,700
like abstaining from sex or abstaining
from things that you enjoy. Yeah,

2564
02:29:37,701 --> 02:29:40,790
you can pretend to be knowable,
but let's get the fuck over that.

2565
02:29:40,820 --> 02:29:43,700
This is nonsense. Some
drinks and have fun. Right.

2566
02:29:43,701 --> 02:29:46,460
And who's going to be more inclined
to do that is people that are more

2567
02:29:46,461 --> 02:29:50,340
comfortable with it. You know,
I love that place. It's great.

2568
02:29:50,930 --> 02:29:54,050
The less restrictions people
have, the more I think, you know,

2569
02:29:54,051 --> 02:29:58,280
people can come to like a comfortable
state on their own without being oppressed

2570
02:29:58,460 --> 02:30:01,010
because that oppression is always
going to make people spring back.

2571
02:30:01,011 --> 02:30:03,680
And the other way, if you tell people
they can't drink, they want to drink more,

2572
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:07,580
tell people to can't fuck. They fucked
behind every goddamn closed door.

2573
02:30:07,581 --> 02:30:09,360
You can find a Catholic school.

2574
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:13,910
I dated this girl in Catholic
school when I talk about her,

2575
02:30:13,911 --> 02:30:18,420
this poor girl could not, she could
not help herself if you rolled a dick.

2576
02:30:18,570 --> 02:30:22,100
I was like a ball of yarn in front
of a kid and she was just dive on it.

2577
02:30:22,101 --> 02:30:23,300
She even know what she was doing.

2578
02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:27,860
She would dive on it like a crazy
person like she, she literally like,

2579
02:30:27,861 --> 02:30:31,220
it's unfair if a guy pulled his cock out
in front of her because for her it was

2580
02:30:31,221 --> 02:30:34,150
just like a fucking leper. Khan showed
up at the bottom of the rainbows, like,

2581
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:39,020
look, I've got the gold suppression,

2582
02:30:39,290 --> 02:30:40,970
suppression,
Catholic suppression,

2583
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,000
all that crazy human beings
don't like to be told,

2584
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:45,890
I have children and I have daughters.

2585
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:50,450
I see it very clearly when you tell
them what to do. I want to do it anyway.

2586
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:54,500
But if you rationalize with them and
have conversations with them and say,

2587
02:30:54,501 --> 02:30:55,160
listen,

2588
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:58,360
you can't do it because it's raining
outside and it gets dangerous and this is

2589
02:30:58,361 --> 02:31:01,010
electricity and electricity causes sparks,
so you can't do it.

2590
02:31:01,110 --> 02:31:04,970
Can't go outside with this.
Oh, okay. But I want to,

2591
02:31:04,971 --> 02:31:08,870
I know it looks like fun.
You got to go to bed.

2592
02:31:09,170 --> 02:31:10,010
I want to stay away,

2593
02:31:10,011 --> 02:31:12,680
but you gotta be up in eight hours
and you gotta be really tired.

2594
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:16,030
I know you want to get, but listen,
just relax. We'll read some studies.

2595
02:31:16,070 --> 02:31:19,970
I co I have these like rationalization
conversations with them to try to

2596
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:24,490
avoid that backlash that comes from being
an overbearing parent or an overbank

2597
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:27,420
teacher. Yeah. Those that
people don't like that shit.

2598
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:30,510
Nobody likes you telling them
what to do just the way it is.

2599
02:31:30,990 --> 02:31:32,940
That's why suppression
doesn't work in any form,

2600
02:31:33,090 --> 02:31:35,730
whether it's sexual suppression
or suppressed making, you know,

2601
02:31:35,731 --> 02:31:39,000
alcohol difficult to get ahold of.
People want it, they want it even more.

2602
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:41,160
Look what the fuck is going on
in Portugal. You know, they,

2603
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:46,280
they decriminalized all drugs
and they have way lower cases of,

2604
02:31:46,651 --> 02:31:48,210
um, of um, uh,

2605
02:31:48,330 --> 02:31:52,020
HIV way lower cases of addiction there,
there,

2606
02:31:52,021 --> 02:31:56,160
there all these numbers drop their society
like leveled out because there wasn't

2607
02:31:56,161 --> 02:31:59,340
this massive stigma attached
to all this stuff anymore.

2608
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:01,740
I know that last night,

2609
02:32:04,110 --> 02:32:07,000
I don't mean why not? Why
Not Porch? I just probably,

2610
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:10,050
I think if you go somewhere
in another country,

2611
02:32:10,051 --> 02:32:11,370
I mean the only ones I go for work,

2612
02:32:11,730 --> 02:32:16,710
I would at least want to
acquire a rudimentary grasp
of the language just out of

2613
02:32:16,711 --> 02:32:20,370
respect. That's tough. It's very hard.

2614
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:25,490
Spain, like you think he speaks Spanish
and they're like, well no bed actually.

2615
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:28,980
Well in France apparently, you know,
everybody like talk shit about the French.

2616
02:32:29,010 --> 02:32:32,550
But from my experience or my friends'
experiences that I've talked to them,

2617
02:32:32,551 --> 02:32:34,290
they say as long as you try,

2618
02:32:34,530 --> 02:32:37,740
as long as you like and make some
effort to communicate with them,

2619
02:32:37,741 --> 02:32:41,340
they're very polite. They don't like
as Americans, like how much is this?

2620
02:32:41,790 --> 02:32:45,210
Can I give you American money? And like
shake it in front of their face. Yeah,

2621
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:46,690
no, in span. And you're like,

2622
02:32:46,691 --> 02:32:49,550
say something in Spanish and they
would answer you in English and you're,

2623
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:52,140
Oh really? Yeah, but yeah, but

2624
02:32:53,900 --> 02:32:57,970
yeah, yeah. Sorry. They're like $20.

2625
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:05,920
Did you like Spain? I loved it. My
Buddy Chris lived there for a few years.

2626
02:33:06,620 --> 02:33:08,440
Um,
he lived in Barcelona.

2627
02:33:10,220 --> 02:33:14,450
Oh, the guy because he, he
used the Castilian Lisp and
it was just the two of us.

2628
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:20,220
You'd be like
Barcelona,

2629
02:33:23,060 --> 02:33:27,810
not of you're from Jersey over there.
They say Barcelona.

2630
02:33:28,250 --> 02:33:32,760
Yeah. Really? I mean, not
all over Spain, but if you're

2631
02:33:33,810 --> 02:33:37,490
in Barcelona they do it.
Yeah. [inaudible] Barcelona.

2632
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:40,830
It's called the Castilian
Lisp. Yeah. That's fascinating.

2633
02:33:41,070 --> 02:33:43,830
I've learned a new thing from Amy Schumer.
I had no idea that was the case.

2634
02:33:45,210 --> 02:33:50,110
Probably 30 hours total. And
that's, that's the newest thing.

2635
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:52,590
I'm sure I've learned some things
in the past. Let me review them.

2636
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:54,000
Don't get touching.
Well,

2637
02:33:54,001 --> 02:33:56,730
he said that he never learned anything
from me and he was implying and I was a

2638
02:33:56,731 --> 02:33:59,880
dumb girl.
That's what it triggered me.

2639
02:34:00,530 --> 02:34:02,770
I'm just fucking with you.

2640
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:08,940
I learned a Barcelona,
Barcelona Castilian lift.

2641
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:13,230
You're just talking to your girlfriend
and she knows you're from New Jersey and

2642
02:34:13,231 --> 02:34:15,780
all of a sudden just the two of
you and you're like, oh, Barcelona.

2643
02:34:15,781 --> 02:34:16,770
And you're like,
mmm.

2644
02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:20,320
Barcelona. Say it. Say a
bitch. You know who we are.

2645
02:34:23,110 --> 02:34:27,870
It's been, yeah, a spawn. Yeah. Like when
the next time we go to Spania, wait, what?

2646
02:34:27,871 --> 02:34:32,200
What, what you mean Spain? The fuck
are you saying you're from Trenton?

2647
02:34:33,370 --> 02:34:36,310
I, you know, I believe when
you're over there in the culture,

2648
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:39,880
you should mirror through yourself and
like we're in a hotel room and it's just

2649
02:34:39,881 --> 02:34:42,670
the two of us. A lot of annoying fucking
people out there and Amy Schumer.

2650
02:34:42,671 --> 02:34:45,370
But if it wasn't for them, we would
have less to talk about. Very true.

2651
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:47,150
We wouldn't have as much fun to comedy.

2652
02:34:47,170 --> 02:34:50,740
We have to air grievances and a
microphone in front of drunk people. Yeah,

2653
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:51,670
and well not only that,

2654
02:34:52,120 --> 02:34:55,180
there's a give and a take to the universe
and if everything was all blissful,

2655
02:34:55,181 --> 02:34:59,260
we would have literally nothing to talk
about or talk shit about on stage. Oh,

2656
02:34:59,261 --> 02:35:03,370
thank God. It's far from that. Was that
chaos? We wouldn't exist, Amy Schumer.

2657
02:35:04,300 --> 02:35:08,180
Okay. Not Exist as comedians. It'd
be known. There was no need for us.

2658
02:35:08,330 --> 02:35:11,480
If everyone achieved enlightenment, we're
a dinosaur. We just don't know it yet.

2659
02:35:11,690 --> 02:35:16,130
As soon as the fucking the, the machine
plugs in and everybody becomes one.

2660
02:35:16,131 --> 02:35:21,020
The trends in dental mind, universal
mind mesh happens due to technology.

2661
02:35:21,140 --> 02:35:24,650
We're at a business. You got to stock
up all this inside Amy Schumer money.

2662
02:35:24,651 --> 02:35:26,550
Now I can.
Okay.

2663
02:35:26,730 --> 02:35:30,580
Because once the fucking singularity
hits you and I are fucked is when's a

2664
02:35:30,581 --> 02:35:32,160
singularity and any day now,

2665
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:36,010
probably 24 39 but any day now can
happen is you get some sneakers.

2666
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:41,430
One's dude from silicone valley or one
Gao or one guy in another country is

2667
02:35:41,761 --> 02:35:42,990
going to come up with something,

2668
02:35:43,260 --> 02:35:46,770
some fucking invention that's going to
change the whole game and flip it right

2669
02:35:46,771 --> 02:35:49,470
on its head and we're all going to be
able to read each other's minds and there

2670
02:35:49,471 --> 02:35:50,304
will be no more jokes.

2671
02:35:51,430 --> 02:35:54,400
I'm more worried that I forgot
to Tivo divas on he this week.

2672
02:35:54,820 --> 02:35:58,120
I think you probably get that on demand.
We live in a new era.

2673
02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:02,500
You can get a lot on demand. A lot of
shows are shows it going on demand.

2674
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:06,610
I see what you did that diffuse with
comedy. Isn't that what we're doing?

2675
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:11,560
We're good at it. Inside Amy
Schumer sign tomorrow night. Right.

2676
02:36:12,070 --> 02:36:14,560
To seem more like an interview than
any conversation I've ever had with,

2677
02:36:14,561 --> 02:36:18,440
you know. Oh well it's usually like a
bunch of animals in here. Yeah. Well No,

2678
02:36:18,441 --> 02:36:22,490
it's just the um, the, the,
the breaking down the mindset,

2679
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:27,680
you know, like fuck process.
I love talking to you too.
Glad we do it more often.

2680
02:36:27,740 --> 02:36:29,870
Yeah, let's do it. When
are you back here again?

2681
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:34,150
I'm here in the next two weeks and then
I'm not. Okay. All right. Wow. I miss you.

2682
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:36,020
You going back to New York?
Yeah. Escaping with the money.

2683
02:36:36,500 --> 02:36:38,020
Leaving with our milk and honey.
Right.

2684
02:36:38,060 --> 02:36:41,250
Going back to your dirty city on the
other side of the wound back. The goal.

2685
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:44,840
It's not cold anymore.
You can return to your last right

2686
02:36:46,390 --> 02:36:48,860
joy. You're hedging your
bets against earthquakes,

2687
02:36:48,861 --> 02:36:51,620
but been living here a few months out of
the year. I see what you're doing. God,

2688
02:36:51,700 --> 02:36:56,360
I'm scared. Yeah. I just had my first one.
It was not fun. I think my pool's broken.

2689
02:36:56,670 --> 02:37:01,430
I know it's a crack in my
brain. Oh my God. I'm fine.
I'm rich. I think it's really,

2690
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:03,890
that's the funniest thing I've ever heard.
I think my pool's broken.

2691
02:37:05,820 --> 02:37:08,300
I don't know what kind of gas.
My antiques,

2692
02:37:10,130 --> 02:37:12,900
I noticed the crack in it the other day.
I don't think the earthquake got me.

2693
02:37:12,901 --> 02:37:16,010
These bitches,
these motherfuckers in the earthquake.

2694
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:20,510
The really crazy thing is those proport
crazy assholes that live on those hills.

2695
02:37:20,660 --> 02:37:23,990
Like when you go through Laurel and you
drive up the Canyon and he sees people

2696
02:37:23,991 --> 02:37:28,280
that are literally pee perched on on
these, these still are you going to do?

2697
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:32,530
It's crazy.
I watched one house fall apart when I was,

2698
02:37:32,790 --> 02:37:37,370
when I first moved here and wasn't a
really big earthquake. It was a small,

2699
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:41,060
you know what? Actually I want to say,
it may not have even been an earthquake.

2700
02:37:41,061 --> 02:37:45,950
It was a landslide and it
was a landslide, um, on,

2701
02:37:46,010 --> 02:37:48,920
uh, on Laurel Canyon. I
guess you're going up,

2702
02:37:48,921 --> 02:37:50,360
but if you headed towards the Improv,

2703
02:37:50,361 --> 02:37:53,150
if you're going up the valley
on the right hand side,

2704
02:37:53,151 --> 02:37:57,530
there's this house that the back of it
just came down and just crush the house

2705
02:37:57,830 --> 02:37:59,370
and it was only that house on the street.

2706
02:37:59,371 --> 02:38:03,530
So I'm pretty sure it was just a local
landslide. Just destroy this entire house,

2707
02:38:03,531 --> 02:38:07,730
pushed it off its foundation.
It happened really recently in Malibu too,

2708
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:08,040
like with,

2709
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:10,550
over the last couple of years there was
a neighborhood where these people got

2710
02:38:10,551 --> 02:38:11,490
woken up in the middle of the night.

2711
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:16,520
He's Bang Bang noises and it was their
house breaking apart and falling down the

2712
02:38:16,701 --> 02:38:17,960
hill and they escape.

2713
02:38:17,961 --> 02:38:21,650
They ran out of the house just in time
where half their house went tumbling into

2714
02:38:21,651 --> 02:38:24,470
the canyon.
How do you sleep like a baby?

2715
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:28,250
You really do like a bear,
like a hibernating bear.

2716
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:30,420
Like I barely got shot with a
tranquilizer dart. That's actually

2717
02:38:31,030 --> 02:38:34,660
because I feel like you're like,
I just, I run out of gas though.

2718
02:38:37,030 --> 02:38:40,640
I just 10 minutes on
stage, I'm just like, nope,

2719
02:38:40,750 --> 02:38:44,220
we're gonna get out of here. I'm going
to work out at midnight and then, um,

2720
02:38:44,350 --> 02:38:47,800
I'll work out for like an hour or so and
then I'll be exhausted by the time two

2721
02:38:47,801 --> 02:38:49,930
o'clock in the morning
rolls out and then I'm out.

2722
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:53,410
Yo [inaudible] how long do you sleep
when you wait hours to see paid hours

2723
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:53,950
tomorrow.

2724
02:38:53,950 --> 02:38:56,740
Got to get up a little bit early because
I got to do some ESPN type shit. Oh,

2725
02:38:56,770 --> 02:39:00,610
nice. You've got to talk
about some fights, upcoming
fights on Fox this weekend.

2726
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:04,840
I'm also, I'm a fox analyst. I don't
know if you know, I'm a sports analyst.

2727
02:39:04,930 --> 02:39:07,260
I can't, no, I, I can't believe

2728
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:11,160
like the, yeah. Why you're
like, you're beyond say,

2729
02:39:12,040 --> 02:39:14,320
um, are you sure? Oh,

2730
02:39:14,350 --> 02:39:17,890
definitely not her or Eddie Izzard
runs marathons. I'm just talking.

2731
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:20,500
It's a lot harder to run the marathons.
I wouldn't do it.

2732
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:25,610
Use your mind like, you know, like I
get tired playing chess. Like I, if I,

2733
02:39:25,611 --> 02:39:29,690
if somebody is like, oh, this stuff
with the, the plane, like I just,

2734
02:39:29,691 --> 02:39:30,770
my mind just shuts off.

2735
02:39:30,771 --> 02:39:34,610
It's just too much for me to
process and I'm just like Zzz Zzz

2736
02:39:34,780 --> 02:39:37,780
but you don't get tired
when you're working on your
show, right? I mean, you do,

2737
02:39:37,781 --> 02:39:42,510
but you're so enthusiastic about it,
right? Yeah. No. Yeah. Okay. Surely.

2738
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:45,730
Same thing. It's a completely, exactly
the same size. They get different mindset.

2739
02:39:45,790 --> 02:39:48,070
Well, it's just what do you,
you're not passionate about chess.

2740
02:39:48,071 --> 02:39:50,440
If you're playing chess, you'd be like,
Oh my God, I'm investing too much energy.

2741
02:39:50,441 --> 02:39:52,390
And there was fuck this.
But if you're working on your show,

2742
02:39:52,391 --> 02:39:55,230
trying to put a sketch, very
meticulous in series about it. Yeah.

2743
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:56,260
It's the same thing with me.

2744
02:39:56,290 --> 02:39:59,200
I'm just lucky that it was like more
than one thing that I do like, you know,

2745
02:39:59,201 --> 02:40:01,990
between the comedy and the
podcasting and the UFC stuff,

2746
02:40:01,991 --> 02:40:05,140
they're all just fun things to me. Yeah.
So it's just a bunch of fun shit to do.

2747
02:40:05,141 --> 02:40:09,090
So. And talk to my friend
Amy. That's a fun sheet.

2748
02:40:10,390 --> 02:40:13,890
Thank you. Thank you. Have Fun in Orlando.

2749
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:17,460
We're going to have a good time.
Me and mad flavor. Aka Joey Diaz.

2750
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Inside Amy Schumer is on Tuesdays at
8:00 PM 10 30 10 30 what time La Tom,

2751
02:40:23,851 --> 02:40:28,440
is it a east coast, west coast thing?
The air over twice at east coast.

2752
02:40:28,470 --> 02:40:32,910
10 30 I got the direct TV, you know,
so sometimes some of the things,

2753
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:35,370
well some of the things
air on east coast time.

2754
02:40:35,730 --> 02:40:38,700
What I'm trying to say is check your
local listings. Ladies and gentlemen,

2755
02:40:38,940 --> 02:40:39,960
inside Amy Schumer.

2756
02:40:40,380 --> 02:40:45,030
Who else is on that lineup on a Tuesday
night on comedy central? Yeah. Oh,

2757
02:40:45,031 --> 02:40:49,860
that's beautiful. Oh, what a great
wave. Oh, that's, that is the spot.

2758
02:40:49,861 --> 02:40:53,520
That's like the spot after friends used
to be on like Thursday night on NBC.

2759
02:40:54,250 --> 02:40:58,860
I'm a bunch of shitty ones. Caroline in
the city. It was terrible. Oh my God.

2760
02:40:58,861 --> 02:41:01,860
Caroline in the city. Yeah. Caroline,
the shitty they used to call it.

2761
02:41:02,910 --> 02:41:05,310
She was nice too. I can picture
that just wasn't a good show.

2762
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:07,380
It was better than the single guy though.
I remember that one.

2763
02:41:11,910 --> 02:41:16,650
Wheezes.
Don't remember.

2764
02:41:16,651 --> 02:41:20,340
I blocked it out. Really? Yeah, like
a finger bang and Catholic school.

2765
02:41:21,310 --> 02:41:24,400
You got finger banged again? No, I didn't,
but I blocked it out as if it was. That

2766
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:28,620
probably was a good show. I'm just
talking shit. I don't remember it at all.

2767
02:41:28,710 --> 02:41:33,540
Literally Tuesday night. 10 30 alright,
we're done. Thank you. You're awesome.

2786
02:42:48,280 --> 02:42:51,940
I were doing a 10:00 PM show at the
Ice House so far. It's Ari Shaffir,

2787
02:42:51,941 --> 02:42:56,410
Duncan Trussell, Tony Hinchcliffe and
me. I'm sure more people will be added.

2788
02:42:56,411 --> 02:42:59,710
10:00 PM show,
15 bucks can't go wrong in your life.

2789
02:42:59,740 --> 02:43:02,800
If you live and you love comedy,
you must go to the ice house.

2790
02:43:02,830 --> 02:43:04,930
Even if I'm not there
anybody there at one time.

2791
02:43:04,990 --> 02:43:08,020
It's the oldest comedy club in
the country. It's in Pasadena.

2792
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:11,440
It's been there since 61 all right.
Go Fuck Yourself. We'll see. Saying.
