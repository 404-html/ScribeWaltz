1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,640
When I'm driving around that corvette.
The corvette doesn't have a radio.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,980
It's one of the best teams.
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,890
You know what and have them know radio
when you drive around with no radio.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,250
D Two one live.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,710
When I was a young and I
used to deliver newspapers,

6
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:21,730
my car didn't have radio and I used to
come up with some of my best shit like

7
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,340
for like standup comedy
material with no radio.

8
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:27,250
Just drive it around doing other things
cause I had a fold newspapers up and

9
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:30,500
throw him out the window.
And when you have no radio you have,

10
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:32,980
you're forced to think. And when you
force a thank you think about shit.

11
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:34,530
When he forced to think
about shit you got,

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,330
it's like we're constantly distracted,
man.

13
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:40,840
We want to look at our phone all the time.
When I see this podcast today,

14
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:45,700
ladies and gentlemen, no laptop. I'm
trying the new thing. Jamie, Nice.

15
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:50,110
No laptop. I'm trying. And then if I got
Jamie here, if I need to Google some shit,

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,130
boom here,

17
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,160
I probably should have tweeted it's
about to start here at Twitter right now.

18
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:59,260
That might help. That might help,
but there you are. Yeah. Here I am.

19
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:02,320
Distracted, distracted.
It's important man.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,540
I mean once it in the car,

21
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,140
you spent so much time in the car and
you listened to music and just to pass

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,770
time.
Exactly with you man.

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,210
Well one thing that's good though
is a podcast and books on tape.

24
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,260
I do. I do really enjoy
doing that. I so I,

25
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,950
I think that like having the
option is probably better,

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,240
but the corvette doesn't have radio
and I just, I liked not having a radio.

27
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,710
I like sometimes just drive it around
just being alone with the thoughts here in

28
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:33,250
the rumble of the engine. You
know, if I had that engine, yes.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,850
Well your engine is pretty fucking
sweet. Sound intense, dope.

30
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,990
But it's not that corvette think sounds
well it's a different kind of thing.

31
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:43,750
But you wouldn't want to live with that
everyday either. You'd get annoyed.

32
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,690
Correct. Alright. You're fucking loud.

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,690
It'd be like living with
a crazy coked up stripper.

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,260
It's just going to say that it's like
dating stripper ban. It seems fun.

35
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,950
Every now and then it gets real.
But not just living with her,

36
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:01,951
but like she would have to drive you to
work and everyone sees you look at hey

37
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,360
and she's got tattoos on her

38
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,070
Mac and cheese loud and
she smells like calm.

39
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,760
I was like, Oh, this is fun on Saturday.

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,620
Yeah. Like listen lady, I'm almost 30
years old. I got to get my life in order.

41
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:20,560
You got to get out of my fucking life. I'm
at Starbucks, which I need you to play.

42
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,960
That's what happens when you're, when
you're young, like those things are okay,

43
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,100
but as you get older you realize like,
hmm, this is not fun. This is just,

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,010
there's a lot happening. So I think
it's fun when I'm drunk, you know?

45
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,690
Well I think it's good for like once
or twice a week and then the girl true.

46
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,050
It depends what they were talking about.
Cars for the group depends on the guy.

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,360
We are talking about cars,
we're talking about all things.

48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,030
You don't want to watch an action
movie every fucking day. Hell No.

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,900
You don't want to watch
explosions and fucking missiles.

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,310
[inaudible] you want to watch like
stepbrothers, fun, mix it up, mix it up.

51
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,040
And I love ice cream but I want every day.
That's

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,700
right.

53
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,590
Mixing it up is big and that's
what people with everything, right?

54
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,950
Everything man. We were talking about it
off the air. People get too comfortable.

55
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,320
They do never comfortable.
You know,

56
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,540
one of the things that would freak
me out lately, not freaking me out,

57
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,810
but it's been like,
I've been like wha wondering on it.

58
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,770
Like on my message board sometimes I'll
have a guest and then I'll read like

59
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,710
after the podcast that like for like,

60
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,990
it's almost like half and
half sometimes like Ha,

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,570
I had this Guy Milo Yiannopoulos,
you Annapolis, Annapolis,
uh, on the other day,

62
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,670
hilarious guys,
gay guy.

63
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,970
He's a blog or really funny blogger.

64
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:41,470
Lives in England and he was over here
from London and some people love the

65
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:46,240
podcasts on people. Fucking
hated it. Worst podcasts ever.
This was shit. Oh my God,

66
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:48,640
this was just hilarious. I love
that guy. He's so entertaining.

67
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,480
I want to drown him in a toilet bowl.
It's like you can't,

68
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,960
that's what you want though. Yeah. You
kind of, that's kind of what you want,

69
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,840
that you want to, as long as they're
talking about it, you're good.

70
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:02,500
You cannot make every, it's not possible
to make everyone happy. It does.

71
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,400
The only person who ever made
everyone happy was bill Cosby.

72
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,590
He was the only guy. I'm not, I'm
not choking. He was the only guy.

73
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,300
You're right. He didn't, but he was
the only guy that for a long time.

74
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,650
You never heard God damn bad thing. Nah,
those Jello commercials pissed me off

75
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,690
that bullshit sweater all the time.
Black blacking up.

76
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,400
He was so good as a comic and so
good as the host of a show and it's,

77
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,470
the Cosby show was so well done that
literally no one spoke ill of them and all

78
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,350
the while he's drugging
checks and ray brown

79
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,560
dude, but he might be the only guy.
There's like a few like Anthony Hopkins,

80
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,070
you know, there's a few actors, but no
one knows him. You know what I'm saying?

81
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,880
Niggas feel like we feel like we
know bill Cosby or we thought we did.

82
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:55,714
We thought we did.

83
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,100
I feel like Jay Leno was one of those
guys in what most people love Jay Leno.

84
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,430
You don't hear a bad thing about
it. Really? Oh, that's so not true.

85
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:08,110
My way off on this. Yeah, you're
so off. Yay. Let, first of all,

86
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,510
I love David Letterman might hate him.
Not just a Letterman,

87
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,390
but there was a bunch of
fans of Conan O'brian.

88
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,420
There was a whole situation where Conan
took over the tonight show and then

89
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:20,650
remember Jay Leno had a show before him
and then it became like this crazy thing

90
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:23,320
where the tonight show wasn't
doing so well. Well, yeah.

91
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,980
This is like Cosby rape and bitches.
Just before that, before that,

92
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,040
before we knew that people still
didn't like him, man. Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,390
There was certain, first of all,
shops love Jay Leno, my household.

94
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,950
What state was this again for Denver?
Colorado sounds about right. We love,

95
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:42,830
especially Lamprey,
weed being legal debt,

96
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,970
living on a farm with really
good electricity that's

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,720
being on a ranch somewhere. So
people that, a satellite dish.

98
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,640
But I think, um, uh, there was a lot
of people from the Howard Stern group,

99
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,260
like for standup comics,
Jay Leno at one point in time,

100
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,840
it was like one of the top comics in
the country, real edgy, real edgy.

101
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:08,210
When he was young, he would go
on David Letterman, be like this,

102
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,380
like super edgy guy.

103
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,160
And then for some comics it felt like
when he started hosting the tonight show,

104
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,240
he kind of became more middle America
and became more, but he did it.

105
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,780
It's like it was a calculated move
on his part. Smart move. Really.

106
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,840
It was a smart man. He's more, he's
more corporate you're saying right.

107
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,020
It kind of sold out. Oh, a hundred percent
corporate Conard percent corporate,

108
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,640
we say sold out.
I don't know,

109
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:31,790
because I think people who like what
he's doing still think what he's doing is

110
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,180
great.

111
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,130
He just found a broader market that
maybe might not appeal to like younger,

112
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:41,810
more hardcore people the way a real sharp
guy like Letterman or maybe Colin and

113
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,700
Colin has some of the best writers in
all of a late night. I love coding. Yeah.

114
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,650
Especially like when he was on in
the late night show in New York,

115
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,690
he had like I had my buddy
used to work for him,

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,560
I got to see like one of their very
first shows, you know how they have it,

117
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:57,880
like we're having this banter back and
forth because we're just talking to

118
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,490
friends just shooting the shit when it
would appear that they were doing that.

119
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,270
But behind them there was placards that
have every word they were supposed to

120
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:09,800
say. So their conversations
were fake blood. Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:14,750
They had a fake conversation so they'd be,
so I went to the zoo yesterday.

122
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,800
So someone's holding up zoo. Yup.
Yup. Right behind him. They had,

123
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:22,430
everything was rehearsed and everything
was preplanned and eventually he got

124
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:23,150
away from that.

125
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,830
And I think in the beginning they were
nervous because he was a writer and so he

126
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:30,320
really didn't have a lot of
performance experience cause he,

127
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:34,580
cause he wrote for Senate
live and Simpsons, right? Is
that correct? I believe so.

128
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,361
I don't know.

129
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:39,470
But I know he was going to be super
respected writer and a really funny guy.

130
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,780
And the thought was that he
was the guy that was like,

131
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:43,670
it was always really funny in the room,

132
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,730
like when he would meet with executives
and writers, he was like the funny guy,

133
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,520
really strong, intelligent,
funny guy. And they're like,

134
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:53,210
this guy should be a host of a fucking
show. And then they decided to, you know,

135
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:56,570
build it up and make it work.
But in the beginning they laid literally,

136
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,030
it's probably micro management
on the network side.

137
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,700
They were probably just
fucking with his show too much.

138
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,890
They didn't just allow it. They're
scared what it is. Yeah, sure.

139
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,130
They're taking a big chance
of having them there.

140
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:09,270
So it was weird that there they're coming,

141
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,930
I don't remember what my original
point was, but their conversation, oh,

142
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:14,600
this is what it was there.
The conversation was written out though.

143
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,900
So it was like the writers, what
really sharp dudes that were trying to,

144
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,710
and then they came out with all these
different characters and reoccurring

145
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,750
themes and everything that
they would use on the show.

146
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,550
And it became like a real cohesive thing.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,290
And then when he went to the tonight show,
they change the show.

148
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,740
Like all of a sudden he was doing
like the tonight show, you know,

149
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:36,650
it's like the whole thing was different.
The feel is different.

150
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,010
You got to do what got you to the dance.
Not only that,

151
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,940
when they did at Jay Leno was number one,

152
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,580
like when they had Jay Leno step out
and they put Conan O'brian in, they,

153
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,450
I think they probably,
you know,

154
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:50,480
they have these weird things where
they base it on how old people are.

155
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,520
Like if you're old as fuck,

156
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:55,170
they don't want you because all
people don't spend any money.

157
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,700
They want those 1834

158
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,840
year old men who are single. That's,
that's the, that's the real money.

159
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,570
The real money is in young dudes who
spend money on stupid shit and they

160
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:08,750
probably easily influenced by commercials.
So they didn't fucking shit. I know

161
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,620
that, I see those KFC
commercial, they fucking go.

162
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,770
But there was also this thing where the
Howard stern show was pissed at him and

163
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:20,520
Howard stern was pissed at
Jay Leno because someone,

164
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,670
whoever it was on the Jay Leno writing
staff most likely was ripping off ideas

165
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,090
from the Howard stern show.
Allegedly. I've never examined this,

166
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,290
but I remember Howard being really
pissed about it and he's not unreasonable

167
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,380
when it comes to stuff like that.

168
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:38,430
It doesn't make sense how it's
a powerful dude too. Yeah.

169
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:41,820
I think also like sometimes
writers do shit like that, man,

170
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,910
that's happened like a gang
at times with standups.

171
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,870
Writers will come to see you perform
and then they turn your bits and like a

172
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:52,680
part in a sitcom that happened
to Kevin James. I witnessed it.

173
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,580
I saw the whole thing.

174
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,990
It's happened to several guys and a
bunch of different shows and well,

175
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:00,930
you know what it is like
say if you're a writer,

176
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:05,160
you're a young kid from fucking
Cleveland and you get a Gig writing for

177
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,210
crystally his show, right? You
got to be assigning a man. Yeah.

178
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,450
You got some fucking demands and some
of these guys will come to comedy clubs

179
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,020
and they'll just pull a pill
for idea. It's a bad idea, man.

180
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,540
I mean just shitty at your
job. It does. It does,

181
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,930
but it also means you're trying to get by.
Fake it till you make it pregnant job,

182
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,720
but you can't fake it off
other people's ideas though.

183
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,540
I bet you're going to get caught up.
I agree.

184
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,510
I think a lot of them is no longevity
and they think they're not going to get

185
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:33,560
caught up. True. They think they're
just going to get away with it.

186
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,490
Just do it now and then.
I'm really good.

187
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:40,050
They just don't know it unless Joe
Rogan sees that shit or anybody now.

188
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,430
You know when I,

189
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,120
when we put out that youtube video of
them and see a thing that was a long ass

190
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:48,930
time ago. I just saw that like couple
months ago. That shit was awkward.

191
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:53,250
It's so awkward.
What'd you get on stage like?

192
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,110
Well, I was on stage before him. I
know the stories coming up. Right.

193
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,520
He actually wasn't supposed to be on.

194
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,730
He took the microphone away
from the guy who was next,

195
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,650
the guy who was next to this guy,
Kirk Fox.

196
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,970
He just debotta like give me the mic
because I brought him up as a writer

197
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,400
because Kurt used to write for,

198
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,850
for Carlos and I said there was a writer
for Carlos men steal. Yeah. And so, uh,

199
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,490
that was it. That was it. It was a
straw that broke the camel's back.

200
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,370
But then you jump up there and then
you, and then he kept saying, he goes,

201
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:23,400
I have the mic. You don't
realize dummies. I have the mic.

202
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:28,350
And you like give me a fucking mic and
you get the Mike shut that shit down once

203
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:32,610
he's still alive. He's alive. Is he
still alive? Did you have him kill? No,

204
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,560
he's alive. The UFC mafia get
to him. Is He, is he dead?

205
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,570
He's out there doing standup still.
Yeah. Yeah. I hope he's doing well.

206
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,630
I hope he's doing well. Hope he's
doing his own shit. You know,

207
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,460
the problem with those guys are,
one of the big problems is when you steal,

208
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,280
you don't learn what it to come up with.
Bit like,

209
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,350
I've got a couple of bets right now
that they're, they might die there.

210
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,600
I'm looking at them, they're like, they'll
like bad dogs. Dogs are broken hips.

211
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:04,930
I'm like this mother fucker down.
So a horse sort of broken legs. See,

212
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm trying to think if I should fix
the bit or if I was just tank it.

213
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,740
That's the battle though, right? It's
what makes you great. It's the, well,

214
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,080
it's the only way to make a bit good.

215
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,740
You gotta bring that motherfucker out
to the light of day and you got to tweak

216
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:20,290
it and roll it.
And there's some times that bit's just,

217
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,820
they just don't seem like
they're gonna make it.

218
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,230
And sometimes you gotta let them go,

219
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,330
but that's why you're
making a living as comedian.

220
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:28,780
And then Carl has been seen as like,
fuck man, we still making a living.

221
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,930
He stopped was still probably does
really well, you think? Yeah. Yeah.

222
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:33,040
I mean he's a name,
you know,

223
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:37,180
he can go to weird spot and do comedy
clubs and still probably do pretty good.

224
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,680
But the reality is, you know,
when you, when you do that,

225
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,580
when you steal,
you usually steal because you're,

226
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,810
there's different mindset for a
plagiarist than there is for someone who's

227
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,653
creative.

228
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,640
And I think the mindset of someone who's
a plagiarist is the mindset of it's all

229
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:58,630
about me, so me getting this
stuff and then I'm going to do it.

230
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,910
I'm going to be a bad motherfucker.
It's about me.

231
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,710
Whereas I think the mindset of someone
who's more creative is all about whatever

232
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:10,711
the idea is and you're just sort of
like on a train to get the idea to the

233
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,280
people. What I think if you're creative
too, you see an idea and you're like,

234
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:18,430
well you, you viewed it from a
different filter. Does that make sense?

235
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,890
I can see the will, people can see an
idea and view it from a different filter.

236
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,010
Like I think this is the funny way.
Like this angle might be funny sometimes.

237
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,520
Yeah, sometimes. I mean, it really
depends entirely on the idea,

238
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,000
but I think the big factor,
one of the big factors is ego.

239
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,040
And if you have a big ego,
it can help you and it can fuck you.

240
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,390
It can do both.

241
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,500
It can help you in the gives you like
the courage and the belief in yourself,

242
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,430
even if it doesn't make any sense to
try something that's very difficult to,

243
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:53,080
it's huge, man. That's huge. At our
first live show, the first eight,

244
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:56,800
nine minutes was me by myself.
How's that?

245
00:13:56,801 --> 00:14:01,720
Was the bit watts is sanded it off.
Who told whose idea was this?

246
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,610
Both of us. Why would you want
to do that? It went awesome, man.

247
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,690
You're talking about egos.
Egos and went great man.

248
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,400
Well People Love Dad came there to see
you, man. So he did stand up. Yeah,

249
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,560
basically. Basically like
told a story. Wow. Yeah.

250
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,250
And had this whole bit and
pieces you've done standup.

251
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,410
Your first standup was in front of a live
audience, right? It was a podcast. Yeah.

252
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,430
That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy.

253
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,740
Your first stand up Everest
on the Internet. Yeah. Whoa.
That's not what we are.

254
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:35,550
We're not releasing it though. Oh, you
haven't released it. We're not going to.

255
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,240
People want to release it last. I'll
release my, my, my standup portion,

256
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,900
but we want to make it special for
the life fans. People hate that.

257
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,360
Why would you want to do that?
They're already there.

258
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,870
It was very west special for them.
They bought,

259
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,260
probably want to hear it again and then
a bunch of other people want to hear it

260
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:52,040
too.
But yeah.

261
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,920
So come to the other live shows.
We're doing all these tours. No,

262
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:59,530
you think we should release it like
their accounts idea? We'll probably mind.

263
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,790
Yeah. Um, I was thinking
as to retard to be yours.

264
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,170
This is my only thing.

265
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,800
I honestly think it's special
for these people live there live.

266
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,450
It's already special for them.
They probably want to hear it again.

267
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,300
There's probably a lot of people that
were there that said that was a really

268
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:25,790
good time. I would love to share
that again in my, on my commute.

269
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,920
And then there's other
people that weren't there,

270
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,410
which you going to punish them
because they couldn't get to break.

271
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,220
That's what you're doing.
That's what you doing, man.

272
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,910
Recording released the house.
Unless you're thinking about,

273
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,323
oh,

274
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,300
you should release it 100% full fuck.
Do I have to do well,

275
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:50,870
you should should. It's good. If it's
good, you should release it. It's great.

276
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:52,910
Then you should definitely release it.
Why not release it?

277
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,600
Because we're doing a nationwide
tour. Good. Keep doing it.

278
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:58,170
Like you would bring more people to the,
to the actual live.

279
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,310
They're going to come anyway.
Don't worry about it. Yes. God,

280
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:04,580
what are you worried about? This 350
million people out there. You can't.

281
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,780
You you need to do is clone yourselves
and have more shows to do them in more

282
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:09,460
spots.

283
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,010
Well you don't need to worry about is
people not showing up at a spot because

284
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:16,820
they heard alive. Unless the live
podcast sucks. If you come up with a dud,

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,240
you do have that advantage, but if you
come up with a dud, you could tank it.

286
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,870
Like if for whatever reason
just goes awful. Just bombed.

287
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,050
Excuse. You know, if someone has to
roofie you or something before the show,

288
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,040
they could, you never know. You just
start talking. I'll tell you what, man,

289
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,970
we did live questions and use. Usually
we filter them. Some girl, you know,

290
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:41,210
like I've never been on stage relates
brightest. Fuck. They give them Mike,

291
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:45,380
some girls shields. Shab uh, do you
remember to me, do you remember me?

292
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,500
I propose to you four years ago
at the UFC expo and you said, yes,

293
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,130
we're the fucks my ring. I was like, what
the fuck? I'm trying to look like fuck.

294
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,620
Is that moving on? Next
question. Next question. Uh,
Brandon, what do you think of?

295
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:00,430
And it's some Ronda Rousey
question. Next question. Oh,

296
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,660
how much would Reebok next question.
Oh yeah, it was fun to mix it up, man.

297
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,560
I get that though. So you're
involved a lot of controversial shit.

298
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,120
Really tell him the truth. Oh,
you're going to be real honest. Yeah.

299
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,990
I mean, being honest. Don't
you think that's controversial?

300
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,880
I guess it is for an athlete.

301
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,360
I guess I'm supposed to be this fucking
cookie cutter and get in line and it's

302
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:25,190
just,
I don't know what,

303
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:28,460
you just have terrible PR skills
and it turns out it works.

304
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,350
It depends how you look at it. What is
PR though? It's public relations. See,

305
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:36,560
that's where they're wrong because your
public relations skills are awesome

306
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,010
because everybody knows you don't really
have a very good filter. No filter.

307
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:43,520
Your filter is like a bunch of string
in front of a river trying to keep the

308
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,420
salmon out.
It's like you need a need more than that.

309
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,170
They're going to get through
that and they go over rocks.

310
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,390
You got to have more than that,
man.

311
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:54,540
It's like a moment of pause where they
get to this training and they go, ah,

312
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,100
what am I doing here? I'm going to do,
someone asked me a question like, oh,

313
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,920
fucking don't worry about it.
You're a good guy. Yeah, sure. Try.

314
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,540
If you're a good guy,
just be yourself.

315
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,250
If you're a good guy and you're telling
the truth, I don't see why there,

316
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,850
why you wouldn't just keep doing it.

317
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:12,570
Like I was training the other day and this
guy came up to me, he goes, man, dude,

318
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:16,050
I love what you do. You know, you give me
motivation to do some outside fighting,

319
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,710
blah, blah, blah. He
goes, but, but he goes,

320
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,790
I wish I could talk about some
stuff. You'll do it, man. Oh, oh,

321
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:28,680
he wishes he could do the same kind
of, but yeah, he just goes, I wish.

322
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,590
He goes, I wish I just can't.
Like some people, well,

323
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,360
he might not be able to now and the road
for him to get to the point where he

324
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:39,980
can is long,
but people that,

325
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:44,490
people always think that they are who
they used to be. Does that make sense?

326
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,630
It's like people look at themselves like
say if you were a loser in high school

327
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:49,081
and you fuck,

328
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:52,140
there's a lot of people that are haunted
by high school for like their whole

329
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:55,800
life or certain events.
Yeah. That's why for sure.

330
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,030
But that's why being bullied
and so dangerous to some
people because if they get

331
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:03,240
really fucked with by people and
tormented by people in high school,

332
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,920
that chicken carry over to wrestle live.
It did, it devastates their confidence.

333
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:11,640
So when the early developmental period
they have it's really poor self image and

334
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:15,860
having a poor self image is fucking super
hard to get over. It was really hard.

335
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,070
Well you know I've talked about before
in this, I've basically body dysmorphia,

336
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:23,810
which is fucking crazy man cause
I'm in great shape. But it,

337
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,840
and it happened in college.

338
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:27,530
I had this girlfriend for a long
time and I had this huge event. Uh,

339
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,670
I was getting ready to trap for
all these NFL teams and I, uh,

340
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,690
the night before I was going through all
my mental stuff on how it was going to

341
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:37,650
do and I put on exactly what I was
going to wear. And it's the, you know,

342
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,320
you don't know how to
act and eat like a pro,

343
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,820
but I did it for fuck four months and I
was like feeling good. And I'm like, damn,

344
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,560
do I look like an NFL guy right now?

345
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,710
This is how an Nfl guy looks right
and that my girlfriend, I go,

346
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:53,280
what do you think? How do I look? And
she goes, look a little soft. You look,

347
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,380
it looks soft. You're the kind of
Chubby. Wow. One girl got you. Got me.

348
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,250
I was literally like,
ever since then,

349
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:05,250
man gave me a fucking with you when she,

350
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,590
did she date some bodybuilders
before you or something?

351
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,480
So dude's cut weight and eat.
I think she was just trying to be honest.

352
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:16,340
Maybe she didn't have a filter. I don't
know. Make that pitch another pill.

353
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,790
Could we see? Yes. You look down under
the car. Did you immediately for calling?

354
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,750
You saw shortly after that, very shortly.
But you were like, why be the nerd?

355
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,450
But ever since then I was
like, damn. And then fuck that.

356
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,220
Fucking my competence the next day.

357
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,790
That can do that then yeah, if you let
it, and I think it's like snake venom.

358
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,970
Like you get a little bite.
Gil will bite every now and then.

359
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,710
I think it's good for you. Good, good.

360
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,050
You got to understand what's
happening when is insulted you,

361
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,650
you got to understand, you
know, and sometimes they're
just being honest with you.

362
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,100
True.

363
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,130
And there's a time for that,
but that was not the time for that.

364
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,020
You had a fucking shows
tryouts, big games. Big,

365
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:56,591
big event.

366
00:20:56,591 --> 00:21:00,640
The next day based on my life up for
at the time is a huge event and she's

367
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:03,280
telling you soft,
tough man has a mean bitch.

368
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,380
Did you guys have fights before this?
Was She mad about something else? Uh,

369
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:10,060
I mean,
I'm sure I was a shitty boyfriend.

370
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,790
Did have another girlfriend at
the time. Yeah, I did. Okay.

371
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,750
We'll figure it out as a bad guy. Well,
I'm not a bad guy. I'm in college.

372
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,170
You're not going to get married. Yeah.
Young, dumb and full of cum. Yeah.

373
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,480
Yeah, it is. Right. That's why
that expression exists. Yeah, man.

374
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:28,960
When you say young and dumb and you never
heard young, dumb and full of calm, no.

375
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,050
Oh my God.
That's a old really up Jamie has,

376
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:36,610
that's all he's heard from me a hundred
times before. Rogue out. Yeah. Yeah, yeah,

377
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:39,970
for sure. It's not mine. I was, I think
it was around when I was in high school.

378
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,110
But you got some old school shit.
I think it's some old school shit,

379
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,800
but it's new school too because I've
heard it from people recently and someone

380
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,400
would have told me that in college
or high school. I'm like, damn,

381
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:51,210
that's aggressive man. Super. That's it.

382
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,520
But correct Jesus Christ. I know, right.

383
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,120
It's like you're just trying
to damn old air flow. Yeah.

384
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,350
But when you say that nobody goes, I don't
even understand. Everybody goes, yeah,

385
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,790
I get it. Yeah. Hundred.
Yeah, 100% that was me.

386
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,210
I was thinking about myself in high
school the other day for whatever reason.

387
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,140
You know like sometimes you have this
weird moment where you just think like,

388
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:11,850
wow,

389
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,240
what was it like to like to be like
if I had to go and do that again,

390
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:19,870
what was it really like?
What are my memories of it
and what was it really like?

391
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,320
Cause my memories of it were
all like, oh, always nervous.

392
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,740
Fucking never confident.
Always weirded out. Yeah. Yeah.

393
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,380
Trying to get away from everybody.
Always just, I was weird here.

394
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,910
That kid so weird.
I was accepted cause I like,

395
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:37,810
I fit in like the way
I looked fit athlete.

396
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,610
I didn't know anything about sports.
I don't know.

397
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:42,370
No sports and all I wanted to do
was kickbox so I wanted to do,

398
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,300
all I wanted to do was taekwondo and
kickbox one tough back then it was a,

399
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:49,440
I was so, I was such a Weirdo. It's
all I did all day. I was upset.

400
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,120
I was always insecure,
everything but that,

401
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,730
like when I did that
I was super confident.

402
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,470
Like I knew I was really good at that.

403
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:59,530
So there was like one thing I couldn't
wait to do and get the fuck away from

404
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:03,070
people. What about girls? I had a
couple of girlfriends. I did all right.

405
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:07,240
I was good looking guy. It wasn't, it
wasn't that hard of just, I wasn't like,

406
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,380
I wasn't very good socially. Not for
sure it wasn't good at it. I was like,

407
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:13,600
it wasn't really good at
that until I calmed down.

408
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,890
Like I don't think I was even that good
socially when I started doing stand up.

409
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,080
I think I got way better at it cause
I realized I need to, but I was,

410
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,000
I was like one of the things that I was
thinking when I first started doing it

411
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,020
was like, man, I wish that,

412
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,470
I wish I would just go back to competing
because in competing I didn't need

413
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:36,660
anybody's approval. I, I kinda liked it
if he didn't like me, I kind of liked it.

414
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:39,130
If there's a bunch of people cheering
against me, I was like, just wait,

415
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,310
wait to see what I do. They're like, wait
a minute. Yeah, it doesn't matter to me.

416
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:44,490
It just going to give
me some more motivation.

417
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:45,950
It's going to give some more intensity.

418
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,150
But with comedy everybody has to like
you and then you realize like you're not

419
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:54,680
that likable. Like just kidding. Yeah.
But like sometimes like things we do,

420
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,320
like things a person does,
you do to be successful,

421
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,380
but you're not thinking in
terms of like being liked.

422
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,790
Like I always wondered about like
guys who are extreme extreme winters,

423
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,380
guys like Lance Armstrong or guys like
Michael Jordan and they get reputations

424
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,180
of being not very good guys are
very nice guys or maybe greedy.

425
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:17,780
Like you always hear that about Jordan.
He doesn't selfie selfish. Selfish.

426
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,100
Yeah man.

427
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,100
Then you got to think like a guy like
that is so focused on this one thing.

428
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,590
He's so focused on winning.

429
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:32,600
You're so focused on just beating everyone
down and it's all about him and him

430
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,434
getting ahead.

431
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,140
You're so focused on that so you're
not thinking about how other people are

432
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,960
perceiving you cause you're like, fuck
them, I'm coming in a dunk on their face.

433
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:41,270
Yeah man. That's, well that's
what greatness requires.

434
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,820
That that's what I learned
through my journey of athletics.

435
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,050
The best players I've ever played with.
They weren't the friendliest,

436
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,070
oh the the the best fighters who I trained
with or best fighters that I ran with.

437
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,970
God, not the friendliest
man. Georges St Pierre.

438
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,760
Saint Pierre's is super fucking
friendly guy. He's like George George.

439
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,410
George is super friendly, super friendly.
I wouldn't say George is the most out.

440
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,070
There's a, there's always
something, George might be
the exception. George is, uh,

441
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,280
a very cerebral fighter.

442
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,900
I went say George isn't the most
outgoing guy, you know what I'm saying?

443
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,460
Like George is kind of an introverted
soul was picked on as a kid and stuff like

444
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:23,180
that. He, he's different. A
lot of the, the super winners,

445
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,670
they're just different
men and it's something,

446
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,600
maybe they are born with that or they
some event in their life happen or

447
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:32,330
something like that and they're
just these ultra winters.

448
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,760
And I could never relate to it.
I gotta be honest.

449
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,870
I wonder if being like that that's the
only way you become an ultra winter.

450
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,910
If you just think about the winning only,

451
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:45,110
you can't be this like really social
butterfly person that just goes around and

452
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,160
makes friends with everybody.

453
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,490
You gotta be some driven psycho that's
getting up at four 30 and running up

454
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:52,550
hills. Yeah, man. And then you
mix that with talent and how yeah.

455
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,840
Fucking the greatness. That's where the
greatness comes from, man. Yeah. You know,

456
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,730
I had a crazy conversation with
Bj Penn the other night. Um,

457
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,690
I just got texts out of the blue
from Bj called Bj up and a beanie.

458
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,470
Bj and I were talking about all sorts of
shit and he was talking to this friend

459
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:12,720
of his, who got his black
belt for years. You know,

460
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,610
Bj got his black belt in three and a
half years, which was crazy. Crazy.

461
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,780
So the guy, you know, and Bj talking
to in Bj goes, wow, that's amazing.

462
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:24,990
Congratulations. You must
be really talented. And he
goes, no. He goes, I'm, I was,

463
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,540
I'm addicted. He goes, I'm
addicted to Jujitsu just like
you, you were addicted to.

464
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,350
And Bj Sat. But he goes, I never thought
about it that way. And then he goes,

465
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:35,530
I realize, yeah, I was addicted. I mean,

466
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,400
that's why I got my black belt
in three and a half years.

467
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:40,550
I was addicted and we were laughing.
He was talking about how he's addicted.

468
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:44,100
So he like final fantasy.
You're playing game. I have

469
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,910
one in like eighth grade. He plays
that shit. He got no one point though.

470
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:52,250
He got addicted to that game. That's
just, again, that's how these,

471
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,150
that's how these crazy successful people
are. The, there is no one foot in,

472
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:00,900
one foot out. It's fucking all
in men and nothing else matters.

473
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,880
Nothing else matters. Yeah. That might
be my problem. Joe. You're too nice.

474
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,230
Um, but on occasionally, like I wash
our cro cop fight the other day.

475
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:13,710
You weren't very nice. No fight.
That was not nice. You know,

476
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,000
you were super aggressive in that
fight. I was, you know, it's weird, man.

477
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:21,840
It's like I watched the, uh, the,

478
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,870
the Alexander in DC fight where it's
back and forth and I used to get inspired

479
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:28,500
by those. Right. I used to,

480
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,010
I used to watch a great fight
and as soon as they ended,

481
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,620
I hit the ground running. Well,
I love to run. I would just run.

482
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,100
That's how I dealt with being
nervous and what's next for me.

483
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:41,760
I just start fucking running now.
When I see that stuff,

484
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,250
I think first about their health, I'm
like, damn, what? I hope he's okay.

485
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,030
Yeah. And I felt that change in me and I'm
like, that's, well that's not good. Yeah,

486
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,520
that's not good. That's not
good. Don't get me wrong. I
still appreciate it. Great.

487
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:58,860
Fine. I fucking love fighting.
I don't miss a fight.

488
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,380
I view it different now
instead of thinking that was
amazing fight. I think, man,

489
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:05,220
I hope they're okay.

490
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,190
Hopefully they're not too injured
and what's next after this?

491
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,990
Even if you win the belt. All right
man, what's after this? Cause I, I've,

492
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,890
I have friends who have
one belt and you know,

493
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:16,020
they're not fucking killing it these days.

494
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,160
It seems like it's one of those
things where you just have to,

495
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,960
you have to be able to put
aside any thoughts of the
damage that you're doing to

496
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:26,820
yourself.
You've got to be able to just do it.

497
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,570
And now as soon as you start taking
into consideration that damage and it

498
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:34,530
becomes, that extra factor becomes that
extra thing that you have to think about,

499
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,930
you know,
that that can fuck with.

500
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,740
And also that thing that can fuck with
greatness like we were talking about,

501
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:44,970
about greatness is like this obsession
plus talent, dedication and drive.

502
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:50,270
But then you add the variable of
fear of injury or concern or playing

503
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:54,740
conservative to avoid
injury. I agree. I think, um,

504
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,130
I was obsessed with fighting and
I think if you ask anyone who,

505
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,420
who trained with me or,
um, one of my coaches, man,

506
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,710
hardest work in the room, Shab
by far I was crazy. Crazy.

507
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,320
But then when it came time to fight,

508
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,120
you ever seen the old school robo cop?
When he's about to attacks on,

509
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:18,150
it's like calculating and it's
like fucking 70% of gun here.

510
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,240
That's how my fucking mind works,
man. I don't know what to do.

511
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,170
You know what I'm saying?
Like, uh, my last fight, I'm
sitting there and I'm like,

512
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,970
I know here you can close this. I know
he's going to kick in too much. Um,

513
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,550
and yeah, I'm thinking too, I'm too,
so rebel. I'm thinking way too much.

514
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,240
While they're probably not like that,
they're going, they're in the zone.

515
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:41,350
They're in the zone there. They're
fighters. They're going, yeah, it's tough,

516
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:42,184
man.

517
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,090
Well, it's one of the most
difficult things I think for,

518
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,240
for people to do is get in that zone to
figure out that that place that you get

519
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:57,001
to where you're just relying on all
of your training and you're just their

520
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,480
instincts. That happened to me
once, once Gabriel, Gonzaga.

521
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,930
Really only once. Only once. I don't
know why. Could not tell you why. Well,

522
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,550
I think I remember that fight.
Just everything was slow motion.

523
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:10,600
I didn't hear the crowd.

524
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,170
Everything you through I already
saw coming and it was just like,

525
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,590
it was just like this white noise.
That's a one time I've been in the zone.

526
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,000
Never gotten the zone and football
really. Maybe once, but fighting, it's a,

527
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,260
it's a fricking to get there, man
is unreal. Well, it's different.

528
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:29,560
It's like if you get in the
zone with a plain pink pawn,

529
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,900
the loss of getting in the zone, it's,
it's not dangerous to your health. Yeah.

530
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,420
I, the thing about fighting that
makes it different than anything else,

531
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,210
even more difficult than Jujitsu cause
Jujitsu's nerve wracking and when to

532
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:45,840
watch two guys going at it and
they're trying to kill each other.

533
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,710
They're nervous as fuck before that,
you know,

534
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,690
but they're not as worried about injury.
It's a different kind of injury.

535
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,110
Cause the Jujitsu injury you might get
choked, you might get your arm snapped.

536
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:58,660
It is possibly get hurt me.
You could always embarrassed,

537
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,070
right or you could land wrong.
Fuck your knee up or fuck your neck up.

538
00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:06,970
But it does happen. It is
possible. But MMA or kickboxing,

539
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,020
anything along those lines.
Moitai yeah,

540
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,000
I watched this Moy Tai knock out the other
day. Oh my God, it was fucking insane.

541
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,530
Some guy from Thailand,

542
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:18,790
I wish I knew who it was cause it was an
animated Gif that someone's sent me and

543
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:21,880
this dude hits this guy with the,
he's got them in a Thai clinch.

544
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:26,050
He hits his guys with this fucking
ridiculous knees to the body like three

545
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,060
Riddick boom, boom, boom.

546
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,710
And they go into the ropes and then
dude hits him with a flying knee that is

547
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:36,340
just the most perfectly time
flying knee snaps his head back.

548
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:40,450
His body goes limp and he just slides
against the ropes and down to the ground,

549
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:45,451
but it was just the poetry of it and
the explosiveness of it that just boom,

550
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,600
boom, boom and he flies through the
air, Bang, hits him in the flying knee,

551
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:53,590
like the fact that that
could happen to you

552
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,700
and you get in there with a guy who's
training how they mean you just like

553
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,680
hoping he doesn't know how to do that.
Yeah, well especially this day and age,

554
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:07,300
you know I was watching the last UFC,
I was watching the last UFC and that that,

555
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,400
what's this? I forget his first
name. The Rodriguez Feller.

556
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,670
I air GI here and the Northcott.
Northcott. I watch. Yeah,

557
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,420
year Rodriguez and I'm like,
what the fuck? Well you
know what the difference is?

558
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,560
The fuck is going on taekwondo,
taekwondo,

559
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,240
those guys have all the other
shit to Northcote this small.

560
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:27,250
I did some research on this kid.
Oh Yeah,

561
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,370
the smallest dad has him fucking
do all this crazy stuff. I'm like,

562
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:34,900
that's the future, man. It's
neck. And then I watched two,

563
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,230
uh, you know, I'm, I going
to say her name. I'll watch
two other guys who, you know,

564
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,980
we're kind of the same class.
They're a

565
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,761
little older than me.

566
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:45,140
I watched him fight after
watching Rodriguez in north
gut and then watching them

567
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:48,710
fight. I'm like, I'm watching.
I go, that's how I fight, man.

568
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,800
That's what it looked like.

569
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,550
Like you fucking went all throwback
Thursday in the middle of the card.

570
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:58,160
You know what I'm saying? Like these
guys are just boxing, wrestling,

571
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,720
and then you see these young guys
and it's like, fuck man. Yeah.

572
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,350
Yeah. Did you see that?
Uh, what is his name?

573
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:10,580
Macramed off the Russian dude
that fought Sean Jordan. Yes.

574
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,280
God Damn,
that guy can throw some fucking kicks.

575
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,180
You see that front leg question Mark
Hickey was hitting him with yes,

576
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:19,010
but it's more of a
taekwondo point scoring.

577
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,030
Like no one's going to be scared
of those kicks. Cool. Great.

578
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,570
Even his punches, all the slapping
you, he's moving, he's moving.

579
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,520
He's going to be in trouble when
he gets in there with a killer.

580
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,590
Maybe not that Jordan's not a killer,

581
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,030
but a guy who can deal with that
maybe and hits for heavyweight.

582
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,120
I was almost a little bit of a a point
score where it's so much footwork and I'd

583
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:42,050
touch and move, touch and move. When you
get a heavyweight and he's gonna. Okay,

584
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,910
touch, touch, judge whacked. Right.

585
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,030
It's like a heavyweight is when he get
in trouble being a lighter heavyweight

586
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,740
maybe. What is he to 40 he's not
lying. He was two 36 I think.

587
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,910
[inaudible] that'd be a lighter,

588
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:57,470
heavier anything on I considered lighter
canes to 40 and he carries a roll of

589
00:33:57,471 --> 00:34:00,260
fat on them. Now would you say
Keynes, a knockout artist? I wouldn't.

590
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,680
I wouldn't say he's a knockout artist,
but you wouldn't want to get hit by him.

591
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,360
But came guy who stands outside
and point points, moods get puts,

592
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,730
gets under hook, puts his head in
your chest and makes you do it.

593
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,710
Does work completely different fighter
mag man seems to fight like more

594
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:16,640
strategically.

595
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:21,560
Avoid damage first and then land
shots and don't drain your gas tank.

596
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,570
I agree.
Which is smart at heavyweight.

597
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,740
So he's a certain point because then you
can get a guy who's not going to play

598
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:31,430
that game. Well we'll see. We'll see
what happens to him as he moves up.

599
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,090
You know and we'll see. What am impressed
with is his technique though. I agree.

600
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:38,300
His counter punching was nasty.
He liked that question.

601
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:40,820
Mark kick does not have a lot of
power behind it. That's a fact.

602
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,790
But the fact that he throws it
like that off of his front leg,

603
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,750
like for folks who don't know
how hard that is to do, that's,

604
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,720
that requires like some crazy dexterity.
And to see that from a heavyweight,

605
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,550
it's pretty rare for the listeners.

606
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:56,090
Most people will know Donald
Cerrone for Donald throws him a lot.

607
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,670
He throws buffer a heavyweight
too. It's pretty crazy. Yeah.

608
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,380
And Well Donald doesn't throw it that
much off his front leg though. Donald Can,

609
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,200
he can certainly count. He'll use the
bag. But that guy was throwing it like,

610
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,380
like a whip office front, like
it was coming up. And then swap,

611
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:13,420
but just there wasn't much behind
it. That'd be my, the, his footwork.

612
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,160
Everything is cardio's great
counter punching dope everything.

613
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,130
But you're going to heavyweight
where they're going to make it count.

614
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,410
Sean Jordan. It's tough
as fuck man. You know,

615
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,890
he broke his rib in that first round.
Yeah, he's went back to his corn.

616
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,980
So all those broken, you never
saw it from his effort. You know,

617
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,450
he never laid back and they were put his
arm over it. Ever tried to protect it.

618
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:37,650
He uh, he had to gut it out while that
guy was staying on the outside land and

619
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:42,060
combinations. Yeah, that main main
event saved that card for sure.

620
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,690
That main event was amazing.
Those guys like sage Northcutt though.

621
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:47,490
And here's another one.
Wonderboy Thompson.

622
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:52,320
Wonderboy is the motherfucker right now.
He's a motherfucker because everybody,

623
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,250
like in the beginning it was about
taking him down and grappling with them.

624
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:59,550
But now that he's been spending so much
time with Weidman and he's learning how

625
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,280
to grapple learning,
grappling, defense correctly,

626
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,800
you're going to see more of what
you saw in the Ellenberger fight.

627
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,120
Guys that are forced to stand up with the
true and joy that you have a good time.

628
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,900
We can we finding a snake,
can we call them wonder man though?

629
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,170
He's 34 couldn't five like what the fuck
is there any way we can use that wonder

630
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:22,260
man? He can keep it. Yeah. He keeps
wheel kicking people in the head.

631
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,020
He can keep it as the only
thing coming up. I don't know.

632
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:27,600
I think you're always fighting.
He got surgery. I know.

633
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,920
Get from person a to bring him in
was named Mark Cart and Denver.

634
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,590
Nate met him through I think a church
thing, whatever, how that goes.

635
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,060
So brought him down and he's just this
bad ass in the gym but had zero grappling.

636
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,610
But standing with them
was a fucking nightmare.

637
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,920
And then Nate told George about them
and then we see Thomson up north and he

638
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:49,440
starts getting his grappling in.
And then when he got to the UFC,

639
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,420
I think he was doing well with matchups
and then he got Matt Brown, right? Yeah.

640
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,530
That's when he got in trouble. Yeah.
Matt Brown beat him up. And he also, uh,

641
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,840
was overtrained for
that fight. He said, uh,

642
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,930
he came in that fight real flat and he
knew it was in trouble even before Matt

643
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,180
Brown. He's like not taking anything
away from Matt Brown. He goes,

644
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:10,860
I just could not recover.
But yeah, he survived though.

645
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:14,190
He made it to the third
round. He's a beast man that
came down to watch for sure.

646
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:18,960
Now he's so nasty. I agree. But what
those guys can do that guys like him guys,

647
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:20,510
I got a year and code.

648
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,260
We're a sage Northcutt rather sage
Northcutt has that front leg kick that he

649
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:27,230
throws and he is very
unusual because he throws,

650
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,680
he stands orthodox and throws his front
leg side kick off his left leg and it's

651
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:35,130
a really good front leg side kick. So
you, so you've seen his previous fights,

652
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:38,670
was he seven to oh seven to nine other
previous sites for getting the UC?

653
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:41,520
I haven't seen anything besides,
I've seen a few of his fights. Okay.

654
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,190
I've been watching him for awhile. I've
been hearing about him for a while too.

655
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:49,050
Um, but what he's, what he's
got is a, uh, an unusual,

656
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,780
he's got a very high level of like
karate and kickboxing and talk window,

657
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,520
very high level of taekwondo skill,
but then also ridiculous athleticism.

658
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,290
Like he does front flips here.
That's what I see out of it.

659
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,620
Doesn't most Flint front flips and lands
on the tips of his toes and like gently

660
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,860
comes down to his heel.
It's not like a clumsy bounce.

661
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,390
It's like this effortless flip where
he knows exactly where the ground is

662
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,590
stocked as Instagram.

663
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,630
I saw him doing some crazy shit like
caring wheels and shit up sand hills.

664
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:23,760
He's a free look at this.
We have this flip.

665
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,600
I mean it looks like it's like some
moon landing shit that looks fake.

666
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,950
It looks like a model too.

667
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,570
He looks like what the fuck is going
on Paige vanzant if she was a boy,

668
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,920
those two need to procreate.
No they don't.

669
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,490
They'll be like some Uber race. Look at
how he does that. Doesn't use your mill.

670
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,790
That literally looks like someone's
got wires attached to it saying,

671
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,670
I'll give you, showed this to Eddie
Bravo and put some chem trails behind it.

672
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,050
He would be absolutely,
dude,

673
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:51,820
he's going off for an hour for Northcott
and half the class right now. I put, ah,

674
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:52,511
dude,

675
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:56,320
you don't use a student at Texas a and
m o was talking about dropping out to do

676
00:38:56,321 --> 00:39:01,210
fighting full time now man. Nah, no
way. Whoa, whoa. Because it pussy.

677
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,310
Yeah. Texting him. Johnny Manziel
who used to run that page.

678
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,920
Now it's you. Mr Northcutt. He's,
I don't think he needs any help.

679
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,400
I think it's probably better if he takes
breaks. Nest a break every now and then.

680
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:17,050
You know, I think he's Uber religious.
I don't think he cares about that.

681
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,170
That's not good. That'll build
up. Kid needs an outlet. Yeah.

682
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:22,010
Those flips won't be happening
like that after a while. Well,

683
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,180
a body like that needs to fuck.
He got a little bit,

684
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,890
I kick to be extra just like those quads.
100% don't sleep on that Dick.

685
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:35,940
Don't cut. His wrestling is good
too though. I mean, he's not like,

686
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,650
he's not like the best in the
world at anything but all together.

687
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:41,840
It's a nasty pack. He's good at
everything and his athleticism is going,

688
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,450
came so far and he's only 19 he's
going to be so much better in a month.

689
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:50,680
You know? It's a little scary being 19
and being in the UFC already is there.

690
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,280
Yeah, you can be champion with it,
but let's say he loses three in a row.

691
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,230
Well that's not what's, what's scary to
me is that he is overmatched quickly.

692
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,380
But that's what I'm saying. We don't
know. We don't know if that even can.

693
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,550
Michael McDonald, Michael McDonald,
19 years old fought Miguel Torres.

694
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,440
Dude Mcdonald before he lost he rife
favor and before he lost a Hennen,

695
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,500
Barao was a motherfucker. Motherfucker.
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

696
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:18,090
Isn't that a perfect, it's a perfect
example. He cares, but you can't do it.

697
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:20,440
This kid can do like with flips and stuff,

698
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:24,250
but Michael McDonald knocks
motherfuckers into oblivion punches.

699
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,310
Where's Michael McDonald right now?

700
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,900
When's the last time he's
heard from [inaudible]? He's
been injured for how long?

701
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,660
Two years. I think he got hurt pretty
bad. I don't know what the injury was.

702
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:34,780
I don't even know if he's,
he was up close as it fucker for awhile.

703
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,310
I'm just saying the only thing that
scares me is like if, if we, uh,

704
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,450
reference boxing. So a 19 year olds
going to have how many amateur fights?

705
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,220
Fucking 300 before they get to
turn pro. Right? This is bay.

706
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,200
We're seeing Northcott's career amateur
career right now with only seven fights.

707
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,270
What the fuck? Seven fights.
Ain't shit. Well that's,

708
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:57,910
let's say when it's three and he's a star.
Hey my man.

709
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,200
Or You went to more your star. There's,
hey bro, there's nowhere to go.

710
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,580
We have to toss you to these monsters.
There's no buildups for three years.

711
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:11,200
Trust me. You would know.
That's an interesting point.

712
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:15,730
That's what's, that's what's tough
about this sport. Like a page, right?

713
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:19,720
She's phenomenal. She looks great.
Speaks great chess skills. Cool man.

714
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:23,950
Let's build this up. She can be your
one 15 pound champ, but she's won what?

715
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:26,840
Two or three now? All right.
Well in that women's Davinci.

716
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,050
So thin we're going to throw
you some mother fuckers.

717
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,940
Well how about the motherfucker?

718
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,250
She's ranked seventh
at the top of the list

719
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,760
is a goddamn murderer straightening
yarder yawn is a murderer.

720
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,690
She's a murderer.
I mean she's the best striker.

721
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,150
Definitely top cup five best strikers
in the UFC. I'd say she Merck's chicks,

722
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,350
she Merck's him. She, she does some
horrible shit to them. Straight up. Yeah.

723
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,130
And so I think like when you look at
her, all right, before she gets into MMA,

724
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:59,270
she's a six time world Moy Thai champion.
That's her amateur background.

725
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,390
What she had to learn was
just take down defense,

726
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:05,450
defend yourself on the ground and figure
out how to get back up to your feet.

727
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,240
That's what cro cop had to
learn in pride. Yup. You know,

728
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,020
and I think when you
deal with someone like,

729
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:12,440
like Gennady Golovkin perfect example,

730
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,840
he's had like a fuck load of amateur
boxing fights. Sane man, saint amount.

731
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:21,710
You turn pro at like late twenties and
then he goes in the pros and these guys

732
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:25,640
just can't fucking compete with him
cause he's ready. He's so ready.

733
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:27,950
He says such another level.
His,

734
00:42:27,951 --> 00:42:32,720
his technique is so sharp and on top of
that he's gets just this stupid punching

735
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:35,600
power that everybody's terrified.
Now would we see triple g, the guy,

736
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:40,220
the superstar, the is now if at 19 we
said, all right, you gotta go pro, boom,

737
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,090
get it. It's a good question. It's
tough right in. But the thing it's,

738
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:46,820
it's no one's fault. That's the empathy
of the UFC. It's just where we're at.

739
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:51,800
But for someone like Paige and Northcott,
like with, with Northcott, if I sat down,

740
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:55,800
I'm like, dude, they offer you a
top 10 guy. No Man, you're good.

741
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,840
I'm telling you bro.
I called,

742
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,780
I called out fucking Brock Lesnar
after I beat fucking Gabriel Gonzaga.

743
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,990
You know what I'm saying? It's like,
dude, what I wish so and been like, Yo,

744
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,510
shop chill man. This, this isn't,

745
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,160
this isn't a fucking sprint hair.
We will got to jog on my man.

746
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:16,700
The boxing systems like super established.
Know that's what I'm saying.

747
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:19,910
It's no one's fault. So long, no one's
fault. But everybody knows how to do it.

748
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,850
Like they know,
like when a guy gets to a certain level,

749
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,740
like you know Terrence Crawford
or something like that,

750
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:29,000
like you give the guy some tests along
the way, but you realize early on, okay,

751
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:31,730
you're dealing with a really talented guy.
This is what we're going to do.

752
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,730
We're going to slowly build them up with
some tougher and tougher fighters and

753
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,990
we're going to see where he's
at and we're gonna sit down.

754
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,430
Like that's why trade trainers
like Freddie Roach are so
invaluable because they

755
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,530
sit down,
they watch as these guys are fighting the,

756
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:45,440
Oh we got to get him with a guy with
a body puncher and we need to see what

757
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:48,320
happens. She gets pressured. We're
going to give him a test in this fight.

758
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,110
And what you're trying to do is
trying to build your fighter up.

759
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,470
Whereas what happens in MMA,

760
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,390
there's no like longterm structure and
there's no amateur structure that's like

761
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,970
comparable to what boxing has.

762
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:07,360
So it's really hard for people to get
built up to the point where they come into

763
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:11,240
the pro ranks with a very
high degree of skill.

764
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:15,530
Unless they come from a different
disap Breslin. I see wrestlers,

765
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:19,280
Damien Maia, Damien Maia,
fucking smashing people.

766
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,100
I mean Tammy Meyers Jujitsu is
terrifying. But what, what was,

767
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:24,620
he was a multiple time
world Jujitsu champion.

768
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:29,060
Shot Gray Jacques Perrey same
thing. Yolana same thing. Murderer,

769
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:32,160
Moy Thai champion, six
time world. You know,

770
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,520
I mean across the board there's so
many examples. Johnny Hendricks,

771
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,160
elite wrestler, Tyron
Woodley, elite wrestler.

772
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,520
I mean you can go down the list came
Alaska Daniel Cormier, wrestlers. Yeah.

773
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,350
You look at all the champs,
Ronda Rousey, judo Olympic. Yup.

774
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,140
Look at all the chances they have this
extent of amateur back and now you get

775
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:52,000
these other guys who don't have that
background. It's such a disadvantage.

776
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,140
No one's fault. No, I'm not
pointing any fingers at all.

777
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,760
I'm saying it's an issue in
the sport where it's tough man.

778
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,970
Because I was talking with, so, uh, I
think it was Kenny Florian. I'm like, man,

779
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,030
I'd love to see Northcott get
like eight fights in the UFC,

780
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,410
Merck people and get comfortable. And
we both agreed that there's, there's,

781
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,350
that's not gonna happen. Cause
he goes, he wins for neuro.

782
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:17,400
People are crying for a tau shot and
a reason for this is because of these

783
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:21,240
freaks, these one percenters that
everyone compares everyone too.

784
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,910
And that's like a Rhonda
Rousey just comes on the scene.

785
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,800
Merck and people are John Jones.

786
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,560
You're talking about most
people aren't like that man.

787
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,910
Those are the Lebron James of our sport
there most people in the sport at the

788
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:36,420
championship level or not like
Jen's what I'm saying or run,

789
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:39,210
but they're just not there.
They don't have that mental game.

790
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:44,070
You know what I'm saying? And then again
at the extensive competition background,

791
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:48,330
before you ever get to MMA, I think
you become like a champion already.

792
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:51,510
Like there's only a few guys
like Gustafson's a good example.

793
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,430
Gustafson was a good boxer.

794
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,420
You know he was an amateur boxer I
believe before he got into MMA. Correct.

795
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,900
But how much experience did we
haven't boxing? Did he? How much?

796
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,140
How many amateur fights of, yeah, I don't
think it's extensive. I don't think,

797
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:09,030
you know, he was like, oh, but he's
obviously like a hair off the champion,

798
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,360
you know a hair off the Jon Jones
fight here off the Cormier fight.

799
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,410
He wins that fifth round with Cormier
and he's a world champion and I agree and

800
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:18,620
it's heartbreaking. It's soup that, that,

801
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:20,280
that fight was super heartbreaking for me.

802
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,360
That fight was crazy for dustbin
cause it's like he lost a John and I,

803
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:27,990
this is loses the DC. He's
just, he's that guy man.

804
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,230
Did you see the picture he posted on his
Instagram today and I saw you between

805
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,120
this almost made me tear up. I know man.
Me Too. You know I love that guy. Yeah,

806
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:40,620
he's a great guy. But I love DC to
DC too. And that was a great fight.

807
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,590
But now you've got a
motherfucker waiting. Yup. John,

808
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:45,450
John and I don't know if
you've seen his Instagram,

809
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:49,440
but this motherfucker's motivated
and lift. He was whooping,

810
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,620
everyone's asked three weeks of training.
What now you're going to take coke,

811
00:46:53,621 --> 00:46:58,180
Keno away from this motherfucker and
drugs and make them lift weights and I was

812
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:00,900
going to do a real camp. What the
fuck do you think's going to happen?

813
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,380
It's going to have a hard time cutting
weight. Nah, it's figure it out.

814
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:10,320
We'll figure it out.
What it was that he looked big,

815
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:15,120
didn't he? Jack looks like he's
getting ready for prison. Jack, Jack,

816
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,780
Jack Man. He's the best. He's the
best. As far as a light heavyweights.

817
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,760
Go for sure. I mean it's not close
though, Joe. You know what I'm saying?

818
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:28,170
Like I love DC, I fucking love DC. He
hit that guy. I love working with them.

819
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,780
I love being around them.
He is greatness at its finest.

820
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,860
And you know I have a son on the way.

821
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,550
DC is a god can point to and say
be like DC. He's a good example.

822
00:47:36,551 --> 00:47:40,060
He's a great dude. He's done it the
right way. You can't say that about John,

823
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:44,920
right? Well right now you
can't. But Johnson, she's a
young guy. He's 27 years old,

824
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:49,570
right? Not that young. But the
thing is is with, uh, with DC,

825
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:52,250
he's like, he's like, he's like the
Phil Mickelson. You what I'm saying?

826
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:55,320
He's like Phil Mickelson of
golf where it's Tom Nicholson.

827
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,030
If tiger woods isn't exactly,
if tiger woods in the round,

828
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,050
we're all fucking wearing
fill mix and shoes and shit
right now. Really? Yeah man.

829
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:03,620
But Tiger Woods is that motherfucker.

830
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,820
He was that 1% better and
just beat them every time.

831
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,560
Socks to be Phil. I know, man
suck. He's still making bank.

832
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,630
He's still making bank
and people love them.

833
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:15,940
But it's a difference
between the UFC and golf.

834
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,590
You're not making that Jon Jones my place.
You can still have a private jet.

835
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,030
You should take down number two's
doing mind Ronda. It ain't fun.

836
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,420
You Ain't sipping champagne with Dana
white on private jet and number two,

837
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,580
we're Nike Shit.

838
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,080
The disparity between number one and
number two financially is fucking enormous

839
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,380
and fighting. Yeah. Fuck
yeah. It's fucking enormous.

840
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,370
It's like there's no other place
where it's bigger, you know?

841
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,500
Uh, yeah, I mean box and you could say
that a little bit. Well not really.

842
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,500
Cause you'll get to knowing who I
think is the biggest threat to John.

843
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,880
I just hear this rumble. Oh
I disagree. I think rumble.

844
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,410
If rumble gets his conditioning together
and I think rumble had a real hard time

845
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:08,410
in that Cormier fight. Um, but the,

846
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:12,070
the rumble that you see when
you saw him fight Jimi Manoa,

847
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,610
the rumble that like you're smiling.
Why are you smiling?

848
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,530
I'm smiling because you're like,
man,

849
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:22,060
if if rumble fucking got his cardio
together Bro and fucking got taller and

850
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:25,710
longer, his not on them. I'm not saying
that you're asking for and say that, well,

851
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,890
can't help Gustafson when he fought
gossips and he took us to send out in the

852
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:34,760
first round. True with a headbutt.
But the thing is, oh no, I love,

853
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,850
don't get me wrong.
We definitely did clash heads,

854
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:40,720
but I think his head got hit too. Exactly.
What happens if John Fights rumble?

855
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,730
What happens?
John takes him down.

856
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,830
Where's his us out and break
some of the second round?

857
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:49,630
Probably so midsummer Tkos wow. That's
how good John is man. And everyone's like,

858
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:52,900
oh, shops at Jon Jones. Not
hugger. Nah Man, he's very good.

859
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,000
I don't know what to tell you. It's
better than very good. Very good.

860
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:57,690
It's not even a good description.
That description. I agree. He's,

861
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,660
he's by far the best. Like there we
have everyone and then we have John.

862
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:04,630
That's how fucking good this guy is.
That's how bad he's beaten.

863
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:07,930
People would have John and the kind
of technique that mighty mouse has.

864
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,610
Fuck kind of took me on footwork. We're
going to ask you like a rumble match.

865
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,410
Like what if to have this time off,

866
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,000
John Jones comes out and
he starts fighting like Tj
Dillashaw. I'm like God, why?

867
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,740
Oh okay. What do you think
about this Tj Dillashaw thing?

868
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:27,810
Tj Dillashaw moved camps to elevation
team elevation in Colorado and you know

869
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:33,170
Uriah is a note. Well
understandably upset. You know,

870
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,860
I knew this far weeks cause he moved
to my head coach, my old head coach.

871
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,410
Oh really? Yeah. I can't say anything.
I don't want to break the news.

872
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,900
I'm not fucking surreal. Hawaii, someone's
coming with cash. Is that what it is?

873
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:47,330
Yeah, muscle farm. Jim is his pain.
The UFC fighters now. Ooh. And so yeah,

874
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:51,680
Tj is grown there and I tell you what
it does. Do you ready for this one?

875
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:56,570
It sets up your a t j Taco
bout our fucking countdown.

876
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,000
What Reebok kits for everybody.

877
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,290
What you imagine that?

878
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,440
Do you think they would do that 100%
they were agreed they would fight each

879
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:10,340
other now even more. Wow. Yeah. They've
said previously they would be down for it.

880
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,430
So what is the muscle farm deals at?
Some dude with oil money or something.

881
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,880
I don't know what those muscle phones,
a diamond factory style or no,

882
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,170
well I think what they're going to do
is cause they can't really be in the UFC

883
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:23,300
anymore, so they came up with
this plan. We're like, all right,

884
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:24,070
we'll sponsor fighters.

885
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:28,140
So we'll get all their Instagram and
social media and we can put our brand on

886
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:32,030
them that way. Oh really? Yeah.
Because since where all came, right,

887
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:34,520
like that's pretty smart. It's
smart. It's actually pretty smart.

888
00:51:34,521 --> 00:51:36,320
I don't know how much to
pay them if it's smart,

889
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:38,090
but what makes smart to
get their social media?

890
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:41,300
Because I always thought about this
because let's say you give me whatever,

891
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:45,800
10 grand to wear a tee shirt for one night
for 30 seconds or you can swap it for

892
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:48,920
the year and all my fucking social
media training, I'm rocking your shit.

893
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,740
You can get way more coverage,
man. Well you can today too,

894
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,910
especially with a guy like Tj is super
popular or someone like Rhonda or you

895
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:59,270
know anyone who's like very
popular on social media.

896
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,810
You'll be social media savvy though.
A lot of guys aren't all,

897
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:06,800
you've got to have someone that works
with you and for you like a manager or

898
00:52:06,801 --> 00:52:09,560
something like that and knows how to do
that shit. I used to hire a photographer,

899
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:12,430
Eric Williams, beast photographer,
and he come to my train camps.

900
00:52:12,431 --> 00:52:14,960
He would take all these pictures and
send to me at night so I could post them

901
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:17,540
throughout the week. You would
post them on yourself? Yeah. Yeah.

902
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,780
Some people post all their shit
theirselves and some people,

903
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:23,510
like some athletes and even some,
uh,

904
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:28,810
like musicians you see like
posts posted by team cruise.

905
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,700
Tom Cruise has like a team that posts,
it's kind of lame though in its very lame.

906
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:37,130
Like I think it's dope that social
media allows people access to that they

907
00:52:37,131 --> 00:52:41,360
normally wouldn't have. Yeah, that's what
I talked about, the personal interaction,

908
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:43,790
like whatever. Not Saying Dick
Pics. We know what I'm saying.

909
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,580
That's what it's supposed to be all about.
It's supposed to be all about like,

910
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,360
like if you get a tweet from me, unless
it's a, if you read a tweet from me,

911
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:53,840
unless it's from a youtube video, like the
youtube videos, when they get uploaded,

912
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:55,640
they automatically generate a tweet.
Yeah.

913
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,620
But that's just the title
of the Youtube Video.

914
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:01,370
There's no opinion in that or anything
like that. If you get opinions or, Hey,

915
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:04,970
this movie was fucking awesome. I ate
at this place. It tasted great. I chill.

916
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,790
That's amazing. 100% I don't
want to let anybody else do that.

917
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,760
My manager one time, I forget
which fight it was like, oh,

918
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,050
I'll tweet live free during your fight.
Like get the fuck outta imagine.

919
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,960
What do you kind of phrasing? Oh
Shit. He was saying, no, hell no, no.

920
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,420
What I was doing a show, they wanted
to take my social media, uh, safe.

921
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,130
I wanted to

922
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,420
take over my social media. You're bat
shit crazy. I never do that. I was like,

923
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:35,060
you gotta be, you gotta be on drugs. I
didn't let my girl fucking see me. What?

924
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,800
I'm not giving the Cineo Hall was a,

925
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:40,950
at the Ice House one night and I was
talking to him. It was after a show,

926
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:45,290
you know, he did the Arsenio Hall reboot
and uh, after they did it for a while,

927
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:49,290
it didn't work. Yeah. It didn't work
out or whatever. He's having fun.

928
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,320
He doesn't give a shit. But he was like,
I can't get my fucking Facebook back.

929
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,650
He's like, they have my Facebook. And
I go, well, you can't get it back.

930
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:57,660
He's so glad to give it to them when a,

931
00:53:57,661 --> 00:54:02,010
I had to give control of my social media
fucked up. Yeah. You got to do that. Well,

932
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:06,600
Kevin Hart was talking about this, how
movies now. Uh, tell him like, hey man,

933
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:08,850
we need you to tweet out or
Instagram the movie. He's like,

934
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:12,330
that's on the contract. If you want that,
you gotta write, then that's extra money,

935
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:15,890
man. This is, this is a completely
different machine. W Well I'm,

936
00:54:15,891 --> 00:54:17,700
I'm doing the movie.
You're pay me for my talent.

937
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,280
If you want me to promote on salt,

938
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,170
my social media that I've
built myself over the years.

939
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,090
You don't have to break
this into the contract.

940
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,120
That's interesting because I would
think that if he did something that he

941
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:30,020
enjoyed, he would want
people to see it so he would,

942
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,440
so I get it 100% I get it 100% I do.

943
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:38,010
But I also think like at his level,

944
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,450
he must be making so much fucking money
that like to say I want more money to

945
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:44,640
use my social media presence,

946
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:48,210
like what the social media presence is
really just going to do is alert his fans

947
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:50,550
to some movie that he's
watching his movie. Good.

948
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,880
Sometimes you gotta be careful of
social media and this is just me, right?

949
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,880
To compare it to Kevin Hart. Tom
Notch. Shit, I'm a grain of sand.

950
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,000
But when a company comes
in, he goes, whatever,

951
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:02,160
we don't work with the fighter
and the kid. I'm like, cool,

952
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,230
well the deals with me and Brian and like,
yeah,

953
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:08,240
but we want your social media to have me
post this stuff. Listen man, Fans Smith,

954
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,460
they hate that shit a motherfucker,
man.

955
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,690
They will always want to figure out
some way to weasel in always some way.

956
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,230
I always gotta be a way to get in
you. You know what? A lot of things,

957
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:24,240
a lot of people are experiencing this,
they're getting courted by these networks.

958
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:25,980
Like there'll be a network,

959
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:30,981
like a podcast network will come to them
and want to take a piece of the action

960
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:34,440
and get in return. They would provide
them with a certain amount of commercials.

961
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,240
Like really?
They're not providing anything.

962
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,660
But what they're doing is they're
saying by saying, you know, hey,

963
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:42,960
we'll provide you with some commercials.
We'll give you some commercial revenue.

964
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,280
But by saying that,

965
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:49,670
what they're really doing is they're
trying to figure out a way where they can

966
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:52,590
make money off of what you're doing.

967
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:54,600
Where you're doing it
completely independently.

968
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,380
Like right now what you're doing is
you're taking your stuff and you're just

969
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:01,560
putting it online.
Now you got to figure out that somehow,

970
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:04,980
some way someone that's eventually going
to figure out how to advertise that.

971
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,690
So what they're doing
is they're seeing like,

972
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,430
this guy is missing out on some money.

973
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:12,090
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to move in
here and I'm going to take some of his,

974
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:13,050
I'm going to give him some money,

975
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:15,840
but I'm going to take some of his money
where it doesn't make any sense that I

976
00:56:15,841 --> 00:56:18,330
would make that money.
They're, they're like,

977
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:23,130
they're giving away 50% in some of these
cases with adjoining podcast networks,

978
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,010
the networks asking

979
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,300
for 50% and the people have done this.
It's like, what are you thinking, man?

980
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,433
It's crazy.

981
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,910
Don't give anyone 50% if you had
a radio show that makes sense,

982
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:38,000
like say if you were on a, you
know, CBS radio, whatever, just to,

983
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,160
just for a name to use, right? And you
had some sports radio show and they said,

984
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:43,980
listen, we're going to
syndicate your show. Uh,

985
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:47,480
we're going to bring your shell
across the country and well,

986
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,221
this is what we want.

987
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:51,280
We're going to get advertisers and we're
going to give you 50% of the ad revenue,

988
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,590
but you're gonna make a lot of
money. You'd be like, well, okay,

989
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:56,710
that sounds pretty good. It sounds like
a good deal, but the really they don't,

990
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,950
there's no channels that people
like automatically go to.

991
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:03,040
What people do is they get,
they download podcasts that they like,

992
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,480
whether it's radio lab or the fighter
and the kid or the Church of what's

993
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:09,970
happening now. They go to what
they like and then they get it.

994
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:15,360
Like the idea that you're just going to
tune into a dial 6:40 AM it's the ghost,

995
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:19,790
you know what I mean? Ghost morning
show, you know what I mean? Like this,

996
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:24,700
that that is like you have a distinct
location that people are accustomed to

997
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:25,750
going to,
they're going to go there.

998
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,200
It's like if you want ad space
on Santa Monica Boulevard,

999
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,810
well you know Santa Monica
Boulevard is a well traveled area.

1000
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,120
If you put up a billboard up there,
it kind of makes sense.

1001
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:37,070
You have to pay a lot of money. But if
someone says, dude, I got this billboard,

1002
00:57:37,071 --> 00:57:40,900
it's the middle of fucking desert. I want
a lot of money, I a fuck load of money.

1003
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:43,960
I want to half of what you may,
50% is billboard up.

1004
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:46,390
Can other people get to that billboard?
Yes.

1005
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,320
They just have to get in their car and
they have to drive out to the desert.

1006
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,560
And now about the money,

1007
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,020
me and Calvin had a serious
discussion because you know, with, uh,

1008
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:59,260
with the Shibori link yet, no
glory. Huh? We're trying to find it.

1009
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,480
I supposed to going with the
podcast to better we, you know,

1010
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,000
we're getting more sponsors,

1011
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,320
advertise and stuff like that and we had
a major like corporate sponsor come to

1012
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:12,220
us now.
I fancy myself when I was younger,

1013
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:16,270
a couple of these products, especially
with cheese and ketchup only, right?

1014
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:18,970
I loved a man.
I don't promote it now,

1015
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,500
but I could buy a lot of with it, you
know what I'm saying? But Kevin was like,

1016
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:27,280
absolutely not, man. He's like, I would
never tell people to buy this stuff.

1017
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,270
You can't tell people to buy that.
You can't.

1018
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,120
It's because it's the talking to
Callen and I ran some stuff by you.

1019
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:37,300
It's just like, you can't do
that man, unless you love it.

1020
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,590
Like if in and out burger came to me
and they wanted to offer a sponsorship,

1021
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:42,790
I might have to fucking say yes.

1022
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:44,770
I'll tell you right now is
the chick fil a comes to me.

1023
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,450
What chick filet to hate gay
people. Do you know that? Hey Man,

1024
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:54,310
I'm striking a chicken sandwich sandwich,
bro. Listen, they hate gay people.

1025
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:58,250
Do they? Yeah. Jamie's like,
not anymore. Not Anymore.

1026
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:03,480
Our push. It only worked on Jamie.
Jamie's you one like not anymore.

1027
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:08,190
He interrupts apart. Not
Anymore. Don't even know that.

1028
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,610
That's why. That's why. Damn. So I can't
eat chick flay anymore. That's crazy.

1029
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,490
That's why those Goddamn promos with work.
That's why those,

1030
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:19,830
they got me and Jamie says, I'll fucking
take a chicken sandwich right now. Oh,

1031
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,130
they're very rude about the gay.
They spend money to try

1032
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:26,990
to stop her marriage.
Yes. Been a big thing.

1033
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,050
You've ruined my good job. It
doesn't matter. You can still eat.

1034
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:31,310
It doesn't matter in the long run.

1035
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,590
I like gay people because
you have stupid opinions.

1036
00:59:33,591 --> 00:59:35,120
Doesn't mean you shouldn't
be allowed to make money.

1037
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:40,370
The problem is when they use no stupid
opinions seat there was super religious

1038
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,470
and that's one of the things
that religious people,

1039
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,540
they don't freak out about some
things that are in the Bible.

1040
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:49,280
I like you very rarely see religious
people protesting against tattoos,

1041
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:54,050
but in the Bible it's very clearly says
don't get tattoos. We're both fucked.

1042
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:55,510
We're both fuck all superfoods.

1043
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,490
Hilarious is there's a lot of people
that are super religious that fucking

1044
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:02,570
tattoo religious shit on their body
that's not supposed to do that.

1045
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,960
Like there's other stuff you're not
supposed to. Like if you go old testament,

1046
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:07,160
you're not supposed to be eating pork.

1047
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,380
You know you're not supposed
to be like an animal.

1048
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:11,360
A split hooves that chews its own cud.

1049
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:14,210
Like there's like we have rules like what
you're supposed to eat and what you're

1050
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:18,230
not allowed to eat and there's a lot
of people that break those rules.

1051
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:22,550
There's a bunch of rules about divorce
and his rules of out property and it's

1052
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,920
like this is the rules that people
break in the Bible all the time,

1053
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,340
but for whatever reason
with really religious folks,

1054
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:33,290
that gay rule is the rule that they want
and forced. I think they give a fuck.

1055
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,950
That's weird. It's weird. Like
my good friend Joe Rogan said,

1056
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:39,410
maybe they're worried that
Dick's tastes delicious,

1057
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,700
they're fighting off the gay for sure
that some of the gay fighting it off like

1058
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:47,870
a vampire or putting garlic around her
neck and shit. It's also, I think they,

1059
01:00:47,871 --> 01:00:50,300
they, they think of gay. This is,

1060
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:54,170
this is my amateur psychologist opinion
love to hear and I think some people

1061
01:00:54,171 --> 01:00:59,171
think of gay as being decadent and
indulgent and that this will lead to Slava

1062
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:07,990
only behavior and too much partying and
fucking and guys suck sucking each other

1063
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,270
off and come at each other.

1064
01:01:09,271 --> 01:01:14,271
And this is not conducive to a good
well-oiled society like Well Oiled Society

1065
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:17,930
needs people to be buttoned
down and conservative.

1066
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:21,650
That's why conservative people, they
tend to dress with like suits and ties.

1067
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,300
They tend to let you know, like,
look, we're going to follow, I'm,

1068
01:01:24,301 --> 01:01:28,620
I'm down with this agenda. Okay.
God, guns, country. Um, uh,

1069
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,670
I listen to country music. I got a
second amendment. They like, there's,

1070
01:01:31,671 --> 01:01:35,510
there's so cookie cutter in the way
they think that it's somewhere along the

1071
01:01:35,511 --> 01:01:39,020
line, like, God, there's so many people
that think along the same way. What is it?

1072
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,900
Well,
this is an adoption of an ideology.

1073
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:46,901
They're adopting a way to think they're
adopting this hardworking American blue

1074
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:52,010
collar or you know, uh, conservative, uh,

1075
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,010
religious God bless America.
Put your hands over your heart.

1076
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:59,270
Let's all join in and in prayer.
God bless America.

1077
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:02,390
Don't you think they're doing that so
they don't have to think for themselves?

1078
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:04,820
There's a little of that. Yeah, there's
a little of that. And there's also,

1079
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:09,850
you're subscribing to this ideology
that would most likely what you believe

1080
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:10,470
it's,

1081
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:15,470
it will most likely prevent people
from acting crazy and doing stupid shit

1082
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:19,190
because they're going to follow God's
rules. So it'd be easier to raise kids.

1083
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,370
Like it'd be easier

1084
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,220
to have a family and just
bring them to church on Sunday.

1085
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:25,440
And you say hello to the Wilsons
and everybody talks fake.

1086
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:29,250
You're all talking like your strip
club Djs. Hello Mr. Wilson. Look, Hey,

1087
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:33,750
you got a nice new sundown there,
Mr. Wilson. Jimmy, come on down. Ah,

1088
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:37,980
listen man. People are looking at it
all wrong. I mean the more gay dudes,

1089
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,320
the better more chicks for me,
man. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1090
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,490
That's what I'm saying.
Well,

1091
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:46,510
I think there's that and there's also
like this shit that I don't like.

1092
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,460
I don't like discrimination. I don't
like it. I like any discrimination.

1093
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:54,960
It drives me nuts. I agree 100% but in
both ways though too. Like I saw today,

1094
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:00,230
there was a Seattle Yoga place that will
not accept white men or white people or

1095
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:06,540
white men. I tweeted it earlier today.
Yeah, there's some Seattle. It is. Fuck,

1096
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,590
do you hate money?
I'll,

1097
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:12,790
I'll pull it up in a yoga class.
Like damn,

1098
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:14,580
there's a lot of black people in there.
Well,

1099
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:17,730
it's not that common and I don't
think, but some people, some of the,

1100
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,180
some of the black folks enjoy the
yoga. Hey mine. I'm saying in general,

1101
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:23,490
if you want to make money for
sure don't kick out white people.

1102
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,660
That's their point. I think they
wanted something that's there is,

1103
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,540
but to say that like that's, you know,
to say that white people can't come.

1104
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,640
Like you got it Tammy, you're
missing the boat, you know,

1105
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:37,380
it just doesn't seem to make any sense.
So when fucked you on your business plan,

1106
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:40,350
well no whites allowed. It's whites. Yeah.

1107
01:03:40,351 --> 01:03:42,810
It's only the one we want people of color.

1108
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:47,090
They want to exclude Caucasians in
Seattle. Yes. Kurt Cobain. Lynn,

1109
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,900
you fuck it up man. Yeah, like

1110
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:54,450
white people. Todd's
tough. Well, you know,

1111
01:03:54,451 --> 01:03:58,800
some people think that supporting
black people is not racist.

1112
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,320
That just supporting university,

1113
01:04:01,321 --> 01:04:04,950
supporting black people's not racist
because black people have been oppressed

1114
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,910
and that we,

1115
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:10,260
we are doing is you're giving them place
where they can join in a community and

1116
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:13,560
feel like they belong because they feel
ostracized from the rest of the world.

1117
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:16,950
Especially in Seattle where everybody's
white problem with that kind of thinking

1118
01:04:16,951 --> 01:04:19,860
is, it's still the same thing I was
saying. White people can't come in.

1119
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:22,950
It's like still the same thing saying
like black people can't come in that's

1120
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,860
racist towards white people.
It's just racist.

1121
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:30,280
Just make your fucking yoga place.
Just super and guidance to blacks.

1122
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,960
Make it awesome, make it awesome
to everybody and you know, and,

1123
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:36,210
and if you want more black people to do
it because you identify with those black

1124
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:37,290
people,
reach out to them.

1125
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,850
But to say that white people can't come
to your yoga class, that seems crazy.

1126
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:46,200
Why would you not like people based on
how much melanin they carry it in their

1127
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:49,830
skin or their ethnic origin of their
grandparents? It is fucking stupid.

1128
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:53,670
It's fucking stupid. So stupid. If
you're white, stupid. If you're black,

1129
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:56,400
it's stupid. It's stupid.
You're ignorant. Yeah.

1130
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:01,660
So what religions Chick-Filet
Christian fucking a,

1131
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,830
yeah, it is heartbreaking.
Yeah. Fuck you. Check.

1132
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,410
There's a bunch of
Chick-Filet stuff online.

1133
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:10,460
Like there's people that were boycotting
them and shit. That's crazy, man.

1134
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:13,170
You know how to, I had
a cousin who was, uh,

1135
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,740
basically beat to death because
he was gay. Whoa. Yeah, man.

1136
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:18,010
So it's touched for me so

1137
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,400
no more Chick-Filet for me even though
I love that fucking chicken sandwich.

1138
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,890
Yeah,
see that's fucking crazy.

1139
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:27,610
That's not because he's on a bus
and he was very like flamboyant.

1140
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:33,950
They jumped him and basically beat him
to a pulp and he went home and died

1141
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:37,800
later. Um, crazy. Right? Jeez.

1142
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:42,410
Sahmri man didn't mean to fuck up. The
flow of the podcast trees was crow timer.

1143
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:47,830
Denver Denver has on a public
transportation bus. Yeah.

1144
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,770
A bunch of dudes jumped him for
them to find out who it was. Yeah,

1145
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:54,610
they did catch up. Wow. What
happened to them? I'm not sure.

1146
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,600
I remember I was in college at the
time. My Dad telling me, I was like,

1147
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:02,170
what a fucking,
and I remember like when I was younger,

1148
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:04,780
me and my brother are pretty close to him.
Him and his brother Nathan and,

1149
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:10,040
and then then we know you do shit
and just fall out of touch by her.

1150
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,530
And my dad told me, I'm
like, what the fuck?

1151
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:15,010
I remember being mad that I couldn't
help them. It's weird, right?

1152
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:20,320
The idea that someone would want to just
hit someone because they're flamboyant

1153
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:24,280
because it, yeah, I know what the fuck
is wrong with the way they were raised.

1154
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,560
So 100% what it is.
It's the way they were raised.

1155
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:31,120
It's 100% if you were raised in a
community that didn't give a shit,

1156
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:35,140
that would be like no big
deal. Like if if, okay, let's,

1157
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:39,280
let's just say us, like all of us in
this room, like you, me and Jamie.

1158
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,740
If we had our own little community and
one of us had a kid and then other ones,

1159
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,930
another one of us had a kid and
we found out Jamie's kid is gay.

1160
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:51,010
Do you think you would want your kid to
beat up Jamie's kid? He like, would you,

1161
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:52,600
would you say you've
got to kick their ass?

1162
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:55,270
Would you promote that kind of
thinking of it never wet. No Way.

1163
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,070
It would never happen.
It wouldn't be possible.

1164
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:01,180
But when you get enough fucking idiots
in a city and you get enough really

1165
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:01,961
narrow minded,

1166
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:05,650
bigoted people that have these shitty
ideas about other people's sexual

1167
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,280
orientations or the way they
choose to wear their clothes,

1168
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:13,060
or whether they choose to be goth or
whether it's anything, whatever it is,

1169
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:15,100
if it doesn't,
it doesn't affect you.

1170
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:18,100
Is it poisoning your pool
and they killing yours,

1171
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,710
your vegetables and your garden,

1172
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:23,280
like what's going on with
your upset and you're,

1173
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,810
you're raising people
to have this fear of it.

1174
01:07:25,811 --> 01:07:28,360
And then they're interacting with other
people at school and they all have this

1175
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:31,060
fear of it and they all want to let
everybody know that they're not like that.

1176
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:34,300
And one of the best ways to let people
know that you're not like that is to

1177
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:37,790
attack. People are like that
crazy man. Think about, uh, uh,

1178
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:40,850
we had a transgender
person, I'm on our show, uh,

1179
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:45,610
Caitlin back and she was saying, Kristin
Beck, Kristin Beck did save my men,

1180
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,593
Kristen Beck.

1181
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:51,640
And she was saying she'd locked down the
road and just group of five guys came

1182
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:54,490
from behind his beat the shit out of her.
She said it happens all the time.

1183
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:57,910
Transgender, it happens all, it's the
number one concern walking down the road,

1184
01:07:57,911 --> 01:08:02,200
getting beat up
and she was a navy seal.

1185
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,910
He was a navy seal and gets her
ass. What? That's a crazy situation.

1186
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:09,340
I had to be a navy seal,
full beard,

1187
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:14,530
bad ass American killer out there,
I think.

1188
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,130
I think it proves that they're

1189
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,000
wired like that. You know what I'm
saying? Like no one chooses like, oh,

1190
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,920
I want to take all this on and
it's especially today's society.

1191
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:23,350
What y'all want to take us?

1192
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,360
I want to be gay and have people
criticize him and all this shit.

1193
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,300
Some people are certainly wired
that way. I think some are, yes,

1194
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:32,060
and I think some choose, but I think
a lot people are born that way.

1195
01:08:32,061 --> 01:08:34,370
And you know what? Here's the other
thing though. The people that do choose,

1196
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,530
that's their choice. I agree. Fun Man.
They're allowed to have that choice. Yeah.

1197
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:42,250
It's like if you want to be Debbie
now, it's cool. You know what?

1198
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,960
Whoever the fuck you want to
be. I don't give a shit. Again,

1199
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:48,620
same thing if it doesn't affect me, if it
doesn't affect me, I don't really care.

1200
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:52,130
I agree 100% the people that
do care though, they're scary.

1201
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,860
They're scary to those folks.
To folks.

1202
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:59,210
Someone that's transgender or someone
that's flamboyant or or black.

1203
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:02,450
You're in the wrong place. You're black
or white. If you're in the wrong place,

1204
01:09:02,451 --> 01:09:02,961
you're white.

1205
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:05,930
There's people that will beat the fuck
out of you because they feel like you got

1206
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:09,860
a fucking easy hand cause you were
raised white. This will just crazy, man.

1207
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:13,760
There's bad people in almost
every single demographic.

1208
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,580
You're going to find people
that for whatever reason,

1209
01:09:16,581 --> 01:09:20,870
they got to where you are in
a fucked up way. Curve Ball,

1210
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,100
not to change subjects,

1211
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:27,130
but you think fucking humans are mother
fucker watched national geographic for a

1212
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:31,700
little bit. Oh yeah. Mother
Nature is a motherfucker. Yeah,

1213
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:35,150
till another level, man. Oh
yeah. Dude, is this live?

1214
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,610
We got it. It's done now so we
can see the whole thing's done.

1215
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,580
The entire event or getting ready to
start it back up at eight o'clock Pacific

1216
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:46,220
Time. But we've worked Kelly West
coast, you can go back and watch this.

uh, Joe Schilling already fought. The
whole thing was done. Wow, that's crazy.

1219
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:57,350
It's only, it's not even eight o'clock.
Yeah, it's like a four hour event.

1220
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:02,390
But Denver, it's in Denver. That's weird.
They're only an hour. Okay, well let's,

1226
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,260

1230
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,350
Who's a current glory world champion.

1231
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:44,210
He won that fucking crazy four man
tournament. Crazy arts and 11 man.

1232
01:10:44,211 --> 01:10:47,990
Those guys, they had to fight it. Was
it three times or four times in a day?

1233
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:52,250
Three times, right? Three times
that horrible kickboxing fights.

1234
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:55,220
Just he had some rough, oh yeah, man.

1235
01:10:55,221 --> 01:11:00,221
The first one with a Simon Marcus
where it went to the fourth round,

1236
01:11:00,441 --> 01:11:02,690
they had a, they have three
rounds. They were a draw.

1237
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,980
So they went to a fourth
round and Schilling knocked
him out in the fourth round

1238
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:10,520
was fucking crazy. Ah,
that was round one. Two.

1239
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:14,100
Can we get some volume,
Jamie? I don't think, Gloria,
what do you want me to start

1240
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,510
it? This is one of the early ones
is just the whole four hour event.

1241
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:22,920
I got to figure out where. Oh, right.
Does Christ. That's a lot of key.

1242
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:26,160
Let's get a, let's get this, uh,

1243
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:31,220
this screen over here and give
us the data of who is that?

1244
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:36,150
Do that with this? I can't, I'm
using the computer for the video. Oh,

1245
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:39,070
that's right. You're going
to eight and 12 cause. Okay.

1246
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:44,250
Kevin [inaudible] strand a lot of Denver
boys on this card. Being in Denver,

1247
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:48,390
this is a tough place to fight.
Denver can be tricky when you're a,

1248
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,290
well not like Mexico City.
Mexico City is the trickiest of tricky.

1249
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,290
That's why it's going to be interesting
to see the Cain Velasquez we're doing

1250
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:58,470
reading jail. Yeah. Are they
going to do it in Brazil?

1251
01:11:58,471 --> 01:12:01,990
I don't think that that's confirmed
exactly from pretty sure it's confirmed I

1252
01:12:01,991 --> 01:12:04,320
fee. I feel like you would
know better than me. Well,

1253
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:06,150
I don't think it is honestly like it is.

1254
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:10,830
I talked to Javier Melendez how long ago?
Javier Mendez the other day.

1255
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,750
Okay. It's a couple of days
ago, man. I thought it was an,

1256
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,890
I hear Mauro run Nelo.

1257
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,520
I liked his commentary on
these two events. He's great.

1258
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,540
He's gotten so good from doing showtime
boxing during the Floyd Mayweather

1259
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:28,080
fights. He's really, really, he's
excellent. I love the showtime crew.

1260
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:33,450
This feller with the tattoo on his
back with us in Denver at grudge. J Ho.

1261
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:38,180
I liked that tattoo. That's dope.
It's American as fuck. Sawn super.

1262
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:42,130
Got a Goddamn John American flag.
Uh,

1263
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:46,020
you were talking about nature being
a motherfucker watching the, the, uh,

1264
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,320
oh my God, I have to turn it off, man.

1265
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,040
I don't do well seeing the animals
die shit. Horrible Shit Man.

1266
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:56,640
I saw this mountain coat
can chase by a snow leopard.

1267
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,740
Snow Leopard chase him all
the way down the cliff.

1268
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,560
Grabbed him by the ass
about the anus first.

1269
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:06,660
W key got away instead of dealing with
death in the fucking snow leopard full

1270
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:10,770
just jumped in the river,
died. Commit suicide, Babe.

1271
01:13:10,771 --> 01:13:15,120
Baby dare just born in this fucking
wild pack of dogs is coming.

1272
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:19,920
The mom pieces out. This baby
deer can barely stand eight done.

1273
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:23,190
It's intense.
Nature does not fuck around.

1274
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:28,380
More than half of all the Moose
and deer that, uh, get killed.

1275
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:33,150
And Canada, uh, they get killed right
after they're born by bears. Dude,

1276
01:13:33,151 --> 01:13:36,570
I was depressed as fuck coyotes,
shit like that right after they're born.

1277
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,900
You know, that's a big thing
too about grain. You know,

1278
01:13:39,901 --> 01:13:44,280
a lot of people think that they want to
live a life where they're not involved

1279
01:13:44,281 --> 01:13:47,370
in any death. And, uh, that's,
that's a noble, you know,

1280
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:49,680
you don't want to cause any
animal suffering. I get it.

1281
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:53,070
I totally understand that idea. Even
though I hunt and even though I eat meat,

1282
01:13:53,071 --> 01:13:55,170
I totally get why they feel like that.

1283
01:13:55,171 --> 01:13:59,580
But there's a reality to commercial
grain and one of the realities commercial

1284
01:13:59,581 --> 01:14:00,420
grain is, you know, those,

1285
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,150
those things that combines those
things that they turned up there,

1286
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:05,700
they cut the wheat with those
things are indiscriminate.

1287
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:09,930
They kill everything that's on the crusher
rabbits and they kill a lot of fawns

1288
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:12,430
too because Fonz, when they're
young, when they're newborn,

1289
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:14,950
what they like to do is stay put.

1290
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,250
So if there's anything common with they
do is they just stay put and they kind

1291
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:24,070
of hide and they get ground up by the
combined. It's, it's super common.

1292
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,520
Rabbits,
Rodin's ground nesting birds,

1293
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:31,420
all of them get ground up and those
things, there's almost no way,

1294
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:36,100
unless you're growing your own food
and you growing your own vegetables and

1295
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:38,440
you're there for the whole process,
you make your own compost.

1296
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:42,300
There's almost no way to leave. No
footprint. How about that Lq shot.

1297
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:45,610
You just posted it today with the
deal. That thing. I shot it with it.

1298
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:50,260
Wednesday morning. 5,000 pounds. A
thousand pounds. Enormous. A big animal.

1299
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,410
A giant animal. I'll show you another
picture that's even more crazy of it.

1300
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:58,160
What'd you hit? Shoot him with a bazooka.
Bone Arrow. Straight Bodell yeah.

1301
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:02,800
Yeah man. A lot of work went into that.
A lot of skill of the bone now. Yeah.

1302
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:05,530
The SPEC for shoot Arrow bar.
Well it's uh,

1303
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,600
it's coming from a guy who was the
different shirts that you get a look at.

1304
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,650
Huge hanging off of a, uh,
a tree. We're cleaning it.

1305
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:16,570
You kind of get a sense
of how big it really is.

1306
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:20,200
That's how he got into a truck to huge.
Yeah.

1307
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:23,860
He's probably a thousand pound animal.
It's a norm and they get bigger.

1308
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:28,120
There's some, some of the like 12, even
1400 pounds, a really enormous ones,

1309
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,340
especially at [inaudible] ranch.
And by the way,

1310
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:33,700
they're not even the biggest moose
are even bigger than them. Moose,

1311
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:37,600
her giant dude. There's Moose in the
Yukon that are 1800 pounds. Dude.

1312
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:41,380
That thing is fucking huge.
Imagine something twice as big as that.

1313
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:43,870
That's a moose in the Yukon,
literally twice as big.

1314
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,500
Then what do you guys hang it then?
You and your friend? Well first you,

1315
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,610
you back the truck to it and then they'd
put it into the back of a pickup truck

1316
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:56,610
and then we, um, took it to a cooler,
like a walk in cooler and then you,

1317
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,750
then the real work begins.
You start,

1318
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:02,020
it's when you get your hands on
ordering it and taking pieces off of it.

1319
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:05,270
And you brought it home. I
brought most of it home. Uh,

1320
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:10,150
some of it is at a butcher shop and it's
getting a turn into sausages and shit.

1321
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:13,360
And when you shoot some elk sausage,
sausage,

1322
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:17,080
high protein son might wake up in the
middle of the night with Predator dreams

1323
01:16:17,081 --> 01:16:21,970
though. When you shoot a thing like
that, how long did it take for it to die?

1324
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,120
That was pretty instant. There
was a, it was a perfect scenario.

1325
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:28,240
It was dead within a minute.
But you know,

1326
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:31,090
that's one of the things
about the discipline of, uh,

1327
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,580
of getting better at getting
better at dealing with the nerves,

1328
01:16:36,581 --> 01:16:38,020
getting better at aiming,

1329
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,500
making sure your archery skills are
on point or your rifle skills for that

1330
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:45,820
matter. Like rifle, you could injure
an animal rifle hunting too. Super,

1331
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,370
super important that you
work really hard on it.

1332
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,690
It's also just so fucking nerve wracking,
really. God, this is my thing though,

1333
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:55,540
with that fucking giant elk.
If let's say you nick it,

1334
01:16:55,541 --> 01:17:00,160
you miss or whatever and you it had
your way. It's your ass. Really? Yeah.

1335
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:04,000
You're fucked. And if it
decides to, Oh yeah, I'll slap
the shit. Oh you. Thank you.

1336
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:08,620
Well, does she the antlers? I did
see the antlers. Dude. It's a tree.

1337
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:12,620
It's Kinda trail behind a tree, bro.
I don't get it. All right, so Tom,

1338
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:14,900
if you could go behind a tree,
you could pull it off,

1339
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:19,400
but keep going around the table.
If you got stuck in an open area and some,

1340
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:22,910
for some reason he got to you
first and getting fucked up,

1341
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,980
you're getting fucked up.
It happens.

1342
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:27,380
It's not that common because
they usually scared of people.

1343
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:30,800
They try to get the fuck away from you.
What really happens is more with bears,

1344
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,980
with bears, it could really
happen for sure. And Moose right,

1345
01:17:33,981 --> 01:17:37,400
aren't Mussa gross of a shit. Well,
they're definitely aggressive if you want.

1346
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:41,080
If you wound them Rinella, Steve. No,
my friend from that show meat eater,

1347
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:46,190
he got run over by a fucking moose
on a show dude. It was crazy.

1348
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,740
Did he told me about it after
the fact that I watched on TV,

1349
01:17:48,741 --> 01:17:52,550
like the way he described it, it sounded
crazy. But then watching it you're like,

1350
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:56,480
oh my God, he shot the Moose, the Moose
went down, he thought the Moose was dead,

1351
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:01,940
came up on it and then the Moose got
up and he went, oh shit, he's alive.

1352
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:07,240
And he went to shoot him again and
the gun misfired which is so rare.

1353
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,080
It's so rare that you pull the
trigger and nothing happened.

1354
01:18:10,081 --> 01:18:14,510
So he had a re re chamber another round
and in the process who is moose comes

1355
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:18,050
behind him and sends him flying and
there was blood on him and he couldn't

1356
01:18:18,051 --> 01:18:20,690
figure it out. If it's his blood
or the moose is blood. He's like,

1357
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:22,670
he's feeling his body.
See if he's been punctured.

1358
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:27,110
And we got nailed by a big ass animal.
And for the Moose one for the Moose.

1359
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,880
The Moose get away. No, of course. No,
no, no, no. My Buddy Ryan was there.

1360
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:35,900
Ryan Callahan put a bullet into him.
What happened? We lose our, our feed.

1361
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:39,710
Yeah, let's move ahead. Anyway. Yeah.

1362
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,300
But um, so, you know,

1363
01:18:47,301 --> 01:18:52,190
just nature being dangerous.
Nature, being a ruthless.

1364
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:55,310
We're a, we're so, I'm
so insulated from it.

1365
01:18:55,311 --> 01:18:59,360
That's why people have these beautiful
ideas of what a, what animals aren't.

1366
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,210
How people fit into the food chain.

1367
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,540
We're so used to getting our dirty
work done for us. This is true.

1368
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,960
You got to bring me some time, man.
Oh, I got you. You want to come?

1369
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:13,010
I'm sending Everlast out.
Everlast uh, he totally unrelated.

1370
01:19:13,011 --> 01:19:17,850
They didn't even know that I got
back from, from a hunting and he, uh,

1371
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,710
sent me a text saying that he wants to
hunt and he wants, he wants to, you know,

1372
01:19:21,711 --> 01:19:25,430
find someone that'll take him through it.
And so, uh, I set him up with this guy,

1373
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:28,820
Brian Meadows who, uh, was, uh, my, uh,

1374
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:32,900
guide this past weekend or
one of my guides. And He, um,

1375
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,130
one of the guys that works there,

1376
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:38,220
there's like a bunch of like really good
guides that work at this one ranch and

1377
01:19:38,221 --> 01:19:43,100
uh, he's going to, uh, do like a
thing with him where he takes him out,

1378
01:19:43,101 --> 01:19:44,030
shows him how to shoot,

1379
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,660
shows them how to you in the rifle
and then they're gonna go hunt pigs.

1380
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:51,680
How long is this parable? Days?
Yeah. Well you don't like pigs.

1381
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,470
Some, a little more danger.
You know what I'm saying?

1382
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:59,180
You ever see a wild boar before? Dude,
they have wild boars on this ranch,

1383
01:19:59,181 --> 01:20:03,650
Texas tusks, no tone ranch. It's up north,
north of here, like an hour and a half.

1384
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,720
Not far at all.
They have some photos.

1385
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:10,780
I'll show you some after the show
received bills while the war's not fun.

1386
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,080
Wild boar sound like monsters.
We were,

1387
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:15,460
we were there the first
time I was ever there. Uh,

1388
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:18,580
we were passing by this
really thick, these thick, uh,

1389
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:22,260
grasses like high tall
grasses but weeds and grasses.

1390
01:20:22,261 --> 01:20:25,440
Like it was like four or five feet tall.
He couldn't see inside of it,

1391
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:26,610
but you knew there were pigs in there.

1392
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:31,940
And so we're walking down this dirt road
really slow and quiet so they don't,

1393
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:35,200
they don't even know were there and
we hear them fighting like what?

1394
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:40,400
It sounds like there's demons in
there tearing each other apart.

1395
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:42,140
They fighting for some reason why

1396
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:47,310
they're making all these crazy bore
noises. I was freaked out, dude.

1397
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,130
I was definitely freaked
out by wild boars.

1398
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,300
Did you see that movie or that
TV show? Game of Thrones? Yeah,

1399
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:57,480
the fucking king got killed by a wild
boar. Giant boy until he got them.

1400
01:20:57,481 --> 01:21:01,970
I've seen like one damn, uh, to
just got dropped another demo.

1401
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,410
We don't even know who's fighting,
who's the guy in the orange. Trump's,

1402
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:07,770
that's the Denver kid can understand
them. Train. This is over.

1403
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:15,180
Yeah. Dammit. My kids. Good little
hairy armpits though, Huh? Yeah. Yes.

1404
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:19,950
Those up, man. Let's hold. Cool. I
like that. Was his Bush look like?

1405
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,800
Probably ridiculous. See
that Dick. So you see that?

1406
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,840
You see that doctor in the ring?
They just show him with glasses.

1407
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:33,610
Check this story out. There's
bang. There's bang though.
That doctor on the left.

1408
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,040
Check this out. Oh, so he was in
trouble right now? No, not at all. Okay.

1409
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:41,250
Horrible story though. Jamie. Do
we have any more of these things?

1410
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,200
We have regular coffee, don't we?
Didn't you make regular though?

1411
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:47,400
Are you still in my system? Coffee? No. No
butter. No bullshit. Yeah. So that doctor,

1412
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:52,380
right? He goes on a family vacation
wife, three kids. She bit life,

1413
01:21:52,381 --> 01:21:56,370
three kids and fucking Subaru, outback,
whatever the hell it was. They go,

1414
01:21:56,550 --> 01:22:01,280
he's in Wyoming. They go,
don't drive. There's a flash
flood warning. He goes off.

1415
01:22:01,281 --> 01:22:06,090
Fuck it. We can get through. It drives
flash. Flood warning through this thing.

1416
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,720
Takes the car over.
Entire family dies separate home.

1417
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,300
Oh my God. Three kids. Three little
kids and the wife. Oh my God.

1418
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:19,950
I'm just full of fucking who brought
don't news first. The good news bear.

1419
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:23,250
Hey Man, I didn't know they were going
to show the fucking guy. Oh, Jesus.

1420
01:22:23,251 --> 01:22:25,860
You didn't have to tell the
whole story. It's intense, right?

1421
01:22:25,861 --> 01:22:28,910
That's pretty intense. So then, uh,
Shane car, when a bunch of us did,

1422
01:22:28,911 --> 01:22:33,270
or like a fundraiser form, ugh.
Horrible men. Natures are cruel,

1423
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:36,900
cruel bitch. Nature does not
give a fuck. We found an elk,

1424
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:40,810
the cop murked by another
elk. Dammit. Elton crime.

1425
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,540
That's rare, right? Nope. We're all
super common. They fight to the death.

1426
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:48,600
Sometimes they stab each other
with their giant antlers.

1427
01:22:48,601 --> 01:22:51,270
That's what the amateurs are
for. But occasionally, you know,

1428
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:55,510
sometimes they just get scarred up and
to get you have cuts on their head button

1429
01:22:55,511 --> 01:22:59,010
shit on TV. Maybe rams. Cause they,

1430
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:03,660
they tangle antlers like deer and
elk and Moose. They tangle antlers.

1431
01:23:03,661 --> 01:23:06,010
That's the angle antlers are for,
I'm trying to suck on those

1432
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,220
antlers. So that eight, oh, was it IGF
one or some shit people were doing.

1433
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:14,290
You want the velvet? Yeah. I want to
suck on that velvet. The velvet deer,

1434
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:19,250
velvet and elk velvet. Uh, it was like
a real hot property or one year ago.

1435
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:21,880
It was such a hot property that
what they were doing was it

1436
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:25,720
to see via the, um, the, uh,

1437
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:29,770
there were farms in Alberta where
they were growing this shit.

1438
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:34,780
They were growing elk just to use
their velvet. And then the process,

1439
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:36,400
for whatever reason,

1440
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:40,530
it became less and less
valuable to people and the, uh,

1441
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:44,110
amount that's that Stevia is super weak,
just pour a bunch and they're like,

1442
01:23:44,111 --> 01:23:47,650
it's sugar. I was like the worst Stevia.
Jamie got it from the dollar store.

1443
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,950
Dammit Jamie. But um, um,

1444
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:57,160
so this guy spent like a million dollars
investing in this elk farm thinking

1445
01:23:57,161 --> 01:24:01,770
he's just going to cash and on his
deer of else spreading shit. Yeah.

1446
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,290
From the elk and uh,
eh,

1447
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:07,630
nobody gives a five idea while
he thought it was going to be

1448
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,090
gangbuster business,
but the business dropped.

1449
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:14,200
Is this the same guy that opened up a
fucking all black yoga studio in Seattle?

1450
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:23,500
Oh, those poor fox. They're going to get
attacked and attacked online to them.

1451
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:26,710
They showed this fool's record set
three and five. That's a weird thing.

1452
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,153
Like where

1453
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:31,830
that's bang on Bang, Bang, Bang on bang.

1454
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,360
But he's that guy that um,

1455
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:37,530
this guy tough to man the guy's three
and five are they said he's tough.

1456
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:40,980
The Guy Bang Bang on
bang is the guy that um,

1457
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:47,160
what is his name?
Who did he fight?

1458
01:24:47,161 --> 01:24:50,100
He fought somebody recently on a really
good fight. I'm trying to remember,

1459
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:55,380
but he fought Raymond Daniels and Raymond
Daniels hit him with that spinning

1460
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:58,890
flying ThreeSixty side kick
to the face of it. Yeah,

1461
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:03,630
he jumped with the front leg side kick
like flying side kick and then he touches

1462
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:08,631
you with that and spins and clipped him
right on the Chin and send them to la La

1463
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:13,650
land on banks. Tough as fuck man.
The other guy I think is from La,

1464
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:18,450
I think he's a, uh, he might
be from the yard I think.

1465
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:22,640
Oh Shit. Nice knee. How much of these boys
make? Not that much money, man. Did. Why?

1466
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,970
I'm sure shilling makes good money.

1467
01:25:23,971 --> 01:25:26,640
She'll be making good money in
the light being the headliner.

1468
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:30,570
So anyone know or no, I don't know
what guessing. I'm just guessing.

1469
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:34,230
You know what I just root for for glory.
I love kickboxing.

1470
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:36,630
I've always loved kickboxing.
I love,

1471
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:39,560
I love Moitai to let's I
root for lion fight too.

1472
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:44,940
I almost what? I almost watched
every line fight every glory. Uh,

1473
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:48,160
I watch every one of these. Me
Too, man. I don't miss much.

1474
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:50,860
Especially the lion fight.
I like lion fight cause they use elbows.

1475
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,780
I like lion fight a lot of time.
There's a lot of uh,

1476
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:57,160
new guys on there and they'd
go for fucking broke man.

1477
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:01,150
They seem to get a lot of like high level
Thai guys to correct and they fly him

1478
01:26:01,151 --> 01:26:04,010
in against like an American and show
no one. You seen the wad wildfire.

1479
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,180
Jesus Christ,
he's national.

1480
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:10,690
We've said it before that tiff time bomb
man a little. She's a very good teacher.

1481
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,420
Some takedown defense.
You got one on one 15.

1482
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:16,730
She's very enjoy that
lady's reverse Joanna,

1483
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:20,240
she talked some shit about joining a
stand up. She said she was basic. Ooh,

1484
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:24,930
basic bitch. They say go, we got to
get me trying to start something.

1485
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:29,780
Oh, what do you have in diet
coke? Bitch basic bitch, bitch.

1486
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:34,640
Stupid basic bitch. What'd you got up?
Fucking blueberry muffin with your coffee,

1487
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:39,330
your basic bitch. It's her.
Anything worse to got a basic bitch.

1488
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:43,850
If you're a girl, ruthless man,
it's well being called anything,

1489
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,250
you know, but something
happened. Someone to find you.

1490
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:50,150
But having someone like limited
defining you like that define unit.

1491
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:54,710
You're limited. It's
hard. It's hard out there.

1492
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:58,310
Still worse. Yeah man. It's
worth it to have your coffee.

1493
01:26:58,311 --> 01:27:01,130
Basic pitch book for a girl though.

1494
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,400
Does a girl have to be more than basic
or she could. She'd be basic in hot.

1495
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:10,400
That's tough.
Well see the hot factory?

1496
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:15,680
Well yeah man. It's like that's, that's
nature right there. That is man nature.

1497
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:19,400
One hate on it. And h likes
that hip to waist ratio. We do.

1498
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:23,270
Nature's a big fan of Teddy's.
They're universally accepted.

1499
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:26,150
It's not like there's a place in the
world where you have perfect set of tests

1500
01:27:26,151 --> 01:27:28,040
and people go, Ugh, get those out of here.

1501
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:32,000
There's not a single country where
men don't look at juicy tits and go,

1502
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:36,500
oh yeah, check. Totally useless to sit
on it. They don't do anything for you.

1503
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:40,460
They don't increase pleasure unless
you're fucking, unless your titty fucking,

1504
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:44,360
but you see them and your brain goes,
oh yeah,

1505
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,910
it's nature.
There's bags of fat,

1506
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:51,440
bags of fat with nipples that you can
suck on and they gently put in if they

1507
01:27:51,441 --> 01:27:54,980
have weight to them and the girls riding
you and you could like hoist them up

1508
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,750
and suck on them. Like, oh,
everything gets so exciting. Why does,

1509
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,760
and they do nothing.
They did nothing.

1510
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:05,030
Nature Nature wants you to have a wife
and that's some big old titties so that

1511
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:07,400
when your kids need breast milk,
this,

1512
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:11,090
these titties or down to
produce big ass titties,

1513
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:16,160
dudes that need big hips and fat and
asses and legs that looked like they can

1514
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:21,350
run and jump. So you have kids that
inherit those traits? Yeah, man.

1515
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,900
If you see a girl with like
weird hips and her ass is flat,

1516
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:27,500
she walks with a stumble. You're like,
oh no, no, no. Immediate basic bitch.

1517
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:34,040
I call it the it beat it with your
flat feet. Flat feet, flat ass.

1518
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:37,830
Why can't you walk straight flat outside?

1519
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:41,030
There's nothing worse than a flat
ass. Yeah. I don't mind if a girl,

1520
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:42,530
a small breasts now we'll figure it out.

1521
01:28:42,531 --> 01:28:45,530
A lot of really hot girls that have small
breasts money. We'll figure that out.

1522
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:49,400
Well, it's funny you don't, man, if he
gets serious enough, I'll cover this.

1523
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,960
What'd you though? Would you want to
or would you write a hundred person

1524
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:58,190
shop sponsor. You take
that over, uh, over what?

1525
01:28:58,191 --> 01:29:01,290
What would you take though if you had
the option between a girl with a really

1526
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:02,010
nice acid,

1527
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:06,840
nice legs and small natural breasts
or a girl is pretty dejected ass.

1528
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:07,860
Pretty decent legs,

1529
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:12,861
but big fake titties ass all day because
I can fix the titties because they

1530
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:15,840
haven't, they haven't. What if she
didn't want to fix the titties?

1531
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:19,860
What if that's a deal breaker going to
have to move on? Wow. I'm just kidding.

1532
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,650
I'm not kidding.
I just said if you've seen my girl,

1533
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:29,400
she's from planet Pluto.
But the thing that's so fucked up,

1534
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:33,250
but the thing is they haven't figured
out a good way to make asks implants like

1535
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:37,650
you see a fake ass worst thing you've
ever seen. There's a difference, man.

1536
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,930
There's a difference. The the
ass thing, it's like there's an,

1537
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:42,960
there's like various factors,
right?

1538
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:47,010
The titty factor is like
the nurturing factor.

1539
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:49,860
Like that's the attraction is
that she'll be good at nurturing.

1540
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:54,630
She has breasts for, but the ass
thing is like an athletic body.

1541
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:58,110
It's like an exciting body.
Oh, I'm banks can't fucked up.

1542
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:03,210
This dude who's three and five is teeing
off bitch on form five. You Basically,

1543
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:07,830
oh yeah, he's foreign five tonight.
Five motherfucker. I liked the fact,

1544
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:10,830
oh damn. I liked the fact
he's done. Done, done, done.

1545
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:14,190
I liked the fact that they throw knees.
I do like that.

1546
01:30:14,191 --> 01:30:17,460
I'm glad they could still throw knees
and I think there are a lot of hold only

1547
01:30:17,461 --> 01:30:20,580
with one hand though. That's
it. His fights over. He's
taking it. He's done. Done.

1548
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:23,140
Yeah. Let's go ahead and call us the day.
Everybody. Wow. He's standing or not.

1549
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:26,850
We're Sni. I've ever seen Overeem.
Fujita. Yeah, there was that one.

1550
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:29,890
I thought I'd killed him over and
killed again. Overeem to share it.

1551
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:33,620
You ever see that one? Yes. To
share with the crazy dreadlocks man.

1552
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,340
He hits with a knee and that dude is like,

1553
01:30:35,341 --> 01:30:39,480
he went down like he was Danny Fajita Day.
He was in the ring. Like there it goes,

1554
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:43,110
faces in cave like you so
fucked up and that's Uber Rain.

1555
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:47,010
We're not talking about normal.
Oh No. Like, oh, I don't
know if he's going to win.

1556
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:50,740
We're talking about fucking
Japan over rain. Well, Japan,

1557
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:55,710
Japan over him. Once he hit that
like k one grom pre heavyweights.

1558
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,330
Yeah.
Fuck it.

1559
01:30:58,390 --> 01:31:03,390
Don't they dug up Nazis that
had special science just sued

1560
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:09,770
shit. Brought it into the
lab. Well, this dude, uh,

1561
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,340
four five. What is his
name? Do we know Jamie?

1562
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:18,330
Good for him, man. You know, I've seen
this dude fight before. He's good.

1563
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:22,250
That was like a big victory. That was
very impressive on bank. Took a beat.

1564
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:26,580
Is that Dr. Brooks like Irish
fear got his ear pierced? Well,

1565
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:28,860
maybe he's wiling out.
I'm sure he is.

1566
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:33,600
100 hunter were chains on his
neck to the back. Chest. Palmer.

1567
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:38,190
Hey, he's trying to make it happen. How
dare you? How dare you? How dare you,

1568
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:43,620
dude. If I was like Joe
Rogan, scrooge McDuck rich,

1569
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:47,100
I'm hiring scientists to build
fake ass is like no other.

1570
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:50,850
I don't want to fake gas though.
That's like the flat earth. Tough life.

1571
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:54,060
It's hard out there and you don't breed.

1572
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,910
Just like what happens if you know in the,
in the wild,

1573
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,070
what happens if you have unfavorable
characteristics, you get ate

1574
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:04,630
up as first. That's how it goes. Oh, but
we'll make it prevent way of the world.

1575
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:05,673
It's the way of the world.

1576
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:08,150
But how you can't prevent that with
a piece of plastic. You can wave.

1577
01:32:08,151 --> 01:32:09,280
They're going to be rented. No, no, no.

1578
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:12,700
You can give the illusion
that you preventing it, but
you know that ass is fake.

1579
01:32:12,701 --> 01:32:16,660
It's the same thing with lips. Lips, you
can't do to live. So he did the tits.

1580
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:20,500
They found a crazy loophole with
tits and it works. They snuck in,

1581
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:23,230
they snuck in with a tid implants
and everybody's like, well, hey,

1582
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:26,440
we could do it there. We could
do it everywhere. But you can't.

1583
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:30,380
It only works on women's tits. Doesn't
work on guys tits, dude, I'm not maggots.

1584
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:34,420
10 implants. Women's lips. Girls don't
want that shit. Some women's lips that a,

1585
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:39,340
I'm not mad at them. They get a couple.
We're going to talk off. Here we are.

1586
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:44,860
We really is. Nonsense. This is craziness
bro. Who is this young gentlemen here?

1587
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:48,700
I've seen him fight before. Not a full
crowd yet is this isn't the main card,

1588
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:51,050
is it? No, no. Robert Thomas Geoffery.

1589
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:55,430
If this is early in the
card is early 22 yolks.

1590
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:59,170
My boy and the ride is jacked
at 34 I think he's flourishing.

1591
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:03,310
Makes Sense though, right?
I he's flexing a hundred.

1592
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,760
Got a beautiful beard though in a Mohawk.
That's rare in flavors.

1593
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,120
Fresh off the set of 300 okay.

1594
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:13,330
I think they're going to fix it
with gene therapy. Dude, that's,

1595
01:33:13,331 --> 01:33:14,350
that's the real fix.

1596
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:17,530
This plastic they shove in your ass and
make your ass stick out isn't fooling

1597
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:21,890
anybody. The same thing with your lips
like why are your lips bigger than all the

1598
01:33:21,891 --> 01:33:25,360
surrounding tissue? That doesn't make
any sense. They fool man with the lips.

1599
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:28,660
They full may bro might be a
little bit basic. You know what?

1600
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:33,640
I might be a basic bitch.
I like lips.

1601
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:37,960
I think a girl's lips are like really
important when you're kissing a girl

1602
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:39,880
hockey over many of reasons,

1603
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:43,210
but if you're feeling like
a rubber thing under there,

1604
01:33:43,211 --> 01:33:44,470
I can't think that that would be good.

1605
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:50,050
It just looks weird to not if it's done
right. Okay. Maybe I'm, maybe I'm wrong.

1606
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,630
There's a lot of state doctors out there.
I hope so,

1607
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,430
but I think that the what what
you're seeing now is like this.

1608
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:59,500
It's the beginning.
Like when they were,

1609
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:02,710
when they thought that they could put
like feathers on people and have him jump

1610
01:34:02,711 --> 01:34:07,540
off cliffs and it didn't work out or not.
Well, eventually it became an airplane.

1611
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:08,331
Like somebody had,

1612
01:34:08,331 --> 01:34:12,670
they keep saying like trying with that
thought until they got it right and now

1613
01:34:12,671 --> 01:34:12,941
you know,

1614
01:34:12,941 --> 01:34:17,530
you get on a virgin airlines jet to Boston
and you fucking got the beautiful red

1615
01:34:17,531 --> 01:34:19,810
widget lighting.
You have yourself a champagne.

1616
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:22,330
It all started from some asshole
with a bunch of feathers.

1617
01:34:22,331 --> 01:34:25,810
You thought it could jump
off a cliff. True. It has to
start there. And right now,

1618
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,220
these girls that you're looking at with
these crazy fake lips and these plastic

1619
01:34:30,221 --> 01:34:32,500
plates in their asses,
they make their ass out.

1620
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:36,990
What they are is the dude with the
feather jumping off the cliff and they're

1621
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,540
unfortunate demise and they get tangled
up in the branches of the tree below.

1622
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:45,820
Their unfortunate demise will make
people innovate. True. I'm with you, man.

1623
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:51,020
It's fine. I hope I'm around for that.
What do we got here, Jamie? Oh Damn. This,

1624
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:54,430
this dude from Canada just landed
a beautiful knee to the body.

1625
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,010
So we're watching these
fights. Um, if you're watching

1626
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,410
these at home, you might
not even be able to, uh,

1627
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,710
there's no way you're going
to sync this up, but we'll,

1628
01:35:02,711 --> 01:35:07,550
we'll try to sync it up when once we
get to Joe Schilling, stitch him up who,

1629
01:35:07,551 --> 01:35:11,450
uh, is a little bit later on the
card. Once we get to stitch them up,

1630
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:14,720
we'll tell you exactly what time it is
and you could sync this thing up later.

1631
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,470
This fight him.
I think mcnichols arena,

1632
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,100
that's the old school man
isn't super old school.

1633
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:24,540
One of those few of these was that
team Miss Denver at all in any way?

1634
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:27,740
You know what, now?
Wow. It's weird, right?

1635
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:30,500
I go back and I feel like
I'm in a country Western man.

1636
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:35,300
Denver people are going to eight me,
but it's whatever, bro. It's true.

1637
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:38,870
It's my favorite spot. Oh,
there's some great spots in.

1638
01:35:38,871 --> 01:35:42,440
Have great family and friends, but you
could not pay me to move back there, man.

1639
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,060
I will never leave.

1640
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:49,040
My number one choice comedy
works outside of a California,

1641
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:54,320
Colorado is my number one choice,
either evergreen, evergreen, boulder,

1642
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:58,250
or Denver. He goes, my three
spots that nature. Shit. I
love the paint. Don't shit,

1643
01:35:58,251 --> 01:36:00,620
Bro. You don't like, how
would you kill some shit?

1644
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:02,540
But then I want to go
back to Marina del Rey,

1645
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:07,220
jumping my Porsche and do some weird shit.
As I've gotten older,

1646
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,470
I appreciate nature way more and more.

1647
01:36:09,471 --> 01:36:11,690
I feel like it's like
something that I just didn't,

1648
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:15,120
I didn't appreciate it enough
until I got older. Like a,

1649
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:20,140
I think when I was younger I was always
concentrating entirely on doing whatever

1650
01:36:20,751 --> 01:36:23,960
I'm trying to do, whether it's
fighting or going, getting into comedy,

1651
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,740
getting my career in line, you know,
like becoming a professional comedian.

1652
01:36:27,741 --> 01:36:29,990
And then, you know, all the
things that I've ever done.

1653
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:33,590
I've always been concentrated more on
them than anything else. More on the,

1654
01:36:33,591 --> 01:36:37,940
and then as I got older I started,
well, what brings me pleasure?

1655
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:41,240
I started thinking like, what
do, what do I enjoy being around?

1656
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:44,450
And one of the things that I enjoy
being around was beautiful nature,

1657
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,530
likes to see a mountain.
Like I remember going to, um,

1658
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:52,640
Jesus, I don't know where the fuck it
was. Like one of the first I got us,

1659
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:56,090
you know what to hear. One of the big one
was going to the aspen comedy festival,

1660
01:36:56,091 --> 01:36:59,990
man. I went to the Aspen comedy
festival, I want to say like 2002,

1661
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:02,570
I think it was like 2002. And, uh,

1662
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:07,230
I was in Aspen and I was driving with
this dude who worked for the festival and

1663
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:10,010
he was telling me how he has
elk off of his back porch.

1664
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:12,260
I didn't know elk screamed.
I did. I had no idea.

1665
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:15,860
I didn't know a goddamn thing about
grain back then. And they scream elk.

1666
01:37:15,861 --> 01:37:20,480
Bugling you never heard of elk? Bugling
I recorded some of it from my trip.

1667
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:26,300
You, this is real shit that happened this
week. Elk make it easier to kill you.

1668
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:29,210
They scream. Oh, they don't, they're
not easy to kill it, man. There,

1669
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:33,770
especially with a bow, they're hard.
But what it is is that they, um,

1670
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:38,800
they're trying to get some pussy so they
call out to women or to let them know

1671
01:37:39,681 --> 01:37:41,900
that they're the right to fuck.
And they also call it the men.

1672
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:44,870
They're ready to challenge them
and they, uh, they do battle.

1673
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:47,330
Like I'll show you some pictures
of this dead one that they found.

1674
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:48,860
It got stabbed up.

1675
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:52,660
He got murked by some other
fucking bull and they're big.

1676
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,620
These are a thousand pound animals.

1677
01:37:54,621 --> 01:37:57,130
Just like the you killed bigger
as big as the one I killed.

1678
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:00,780
Thanks fucking the one. The one that died
was bigger than the one I kept bigger.

1679
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:04,500
Who killed him? Some bad ass.
Bitch. Listen to this though.

1680
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,830
This is what it sounds like. Oh,
it sounds like a grown man yelling.

1681
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,630
Hello Sir. I'm here.
It is. Listen. No Sir.

1682
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:21,380
You hear that? That's the
guide. Trying to call them.

1683
01:38:21,381 --> 01:38:24,080
He's making like a cow call to listen
to the sound that they make when they

1684
01:38:24,081 --> 01:38:28,190
respond.
It's like a like a monster

1685
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:37,260
that, that high pitch shit. That's the
guy making the call. Now listen to them.

1686
01:38:42,190 --> 01:38:43,023
Okay.

1687
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:45,000
You hear that almost
sounds like Ortho whales.

1688
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:49,183
Okay.

1689
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:52,790
Damn.
They scream at each other like that.

1690
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:58,990
Now really loud one was the guide
right next to us with the call.

1691
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:06,140
That's one of them screaming
dad. That was an ALC.

1692
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:14,600
Oh, weird. Right. Then do you listen
to that and find out where they're at?

1693
01:39:14,601 --> 01:39:15,760
Just destroy him.
Well,

1694
01:39:15,761 --> 01:39:18,490
you got to sneak up on them when
you should know where they're at.

1695
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:23,470
He sneak up on them and then you hide
behind stuff when you make calls like a

1696
01:39:23,471 --> 01:39:28,000
cow. So they think they're going to get
some pussy fucking basic bitch elks.

1697
01:39:30,850 --> 01:39:34,000
Too easy. Become screaming too
when they come towards you.

1698
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:38,010
That's one of the most nerve
wracking parts about it. Oh yeah.

1699
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:43,100
Cause I think there'd be your hook.
Exactly. Dick out there. Like, what's up?

1700
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,000
Will they come?
They come all over themselves.

1701
01:39:45,001 --> 01:39:47,010
They piss all themselves
and come all themselves.

1702
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:50,160
They look at their whole under suicide.
When you find them in the running.

1703
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,580
Is this covered with like common pis?
They're all wet.

1704
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:57,030
They're looking for a good time. They're
just, they're partying. Fuck man.

1705
01:39:57,031 --> 01:40:01,160
You guys just, Hey, what's up?
Oh, raging boner, ted, bro.

1706
01:40:01,610 --> 01:40:06,390
It is rude. But uh, it's also
hot mountain lions fun too.

1707
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,870
When we were in Colorado, one
of the guys I was with, uh,

1708
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:15,530
told me that they had found this mountain
lion on top of this elk and they found

1709
01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:18,670
it by following the,
uh,

1710
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:22,320
the path that it took once a drag the elk.

1711
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:26,520
So what he found was like you could see
the mountain lion footprints and then he

1712
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:28,740
could see the elk footprints
and then they collide.

1713
01:40:28,741 --> 01:40:32,850
And then there's no more mountain line
footprints because the mountain lion is

1714
01:40:32,851 --> 01:40:34,500
riding the elks back.

1715
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:39,720
Can you get this 1200 pound elk in this
150 pound cat is on its back biting its

1716
01:40:41,851 --> 01:40:46,380
neck and it runs like 102 hundred
yards with this cat on its back.

1717
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:49,620
And then it piles up and
then the cat eats it.

1718
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:53,430
They catch the cat on top of this thing.
You know what man?

1719
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:56,860
I think the reason why I don't get down
with nature and mountains and stuff,

1720
01:40:56,861 --> 01:41:00,940
cause I grew up in Denver man. So I was,
I was going camping all the time. Uh,

1721
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,180
I was shooting arrows when I was
young and shit. So I'm over it man.

1722
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:08,110
I love the ocean. I can't get enough of
the ocean. Yeah, see that's it. You're,

1723
01:41:08,111 --> 01:41:12,760
you're experiencing the new nature.
So then the next, I mean the ocean is,

1724
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:17,020
I rented a place in Malibu for like
three months this last summer and uh,

1725
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,560
I would wake up every morning just
looking at that water going, wow.

1726
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:23,500
I feel like there's nothing
crazy. Love it. It's crazy.

1727
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:28,000
It's a crazy view and it's a,
it's a morphing view.

1728
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:32,560
Like in the daytime it's inviting and
it's night. At nighttime it's terrifying.

1729
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,530
Terrifying.
And that that's the only difference.

1730
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:38,950
The only difference is you can't see.
Yeah. Would you ever live in Malibu?

1731
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:45,220
I don't know if it's wise to
buy a home next to the water.

1732
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:50,020
I don't know if it's wise to spend
several million dollars for a house that's

1733
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:53,470
stuck in the sand right in
front of the lip of the ocean.

1734
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,090
You want to talk about basic bitches?

1735
01:41:55,091 --> 01:42:00,091
Like are you not paying attention to
the entirety of the human history that's

1736
01:42:00,341 --> 01:42:05,341
been recorded about the changing of the
earth's atmosphere and about how the,

1737
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:08,920
like you find cities that are underwater,

1738
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:11,960
there were like Roman cities and
shit and other underwater. Why?

1739
01:42:11,961 --> 01:42:14,760
Why are they underwater? Well, they're
underwater because there's the,

1740
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:19,350
the ocean moves expense. It's not stuck
there. It's not going to stay. Exactly.

1741
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:22,450
If you're looking for investment
2000 years from now, yeah,

1742
01:42:22,451 --> 01:42:24,940
probably don't buy a house in Malibu.
However, for when you're alive,

1743
01:42:24,941 --> 01:42:29,200
you should be fine, Joe. You know
what I'm saying? Yeah. Maybe,

1744
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:32,650
but maybe not. I can almost guarantee.
How about fun? What happened in Japan?

1745
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:37,320
That shit could happen in
Malibu in the day and Indian,

1746
01:42:37,321 --> 01:42:40,580
you need need day. I have a friend
who lives in Pacific Palisades.

1747
01:42:40,581 --> 01:42:43,240
It's got a nice sweet
spot up a hill and uh,

1748
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:45,250
I could want you to live by the water.
You've got a lot of money. He goes,

1749
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:50,230
so nominees tsunamis. I go, really?
He goes, yeah. He goes, they happen.

1750
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:53,890
He goes, they might not happen, but they
happen. And when they happen, guess what?

1751
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,581
What are you gonna hear?

1752
01:42:54,581 --> 01:42:57,580
You can hear a horn mill the night
I sleep with a sound machine.

1753
01:42:57,581 --> 01:42:59,010
I have a sound machine
next to my bed place.

1754
01:42:59,011 --> 01:43:02,170
Sounds like birds and shits or get
sleep. That's what he said. He goes,

1755
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:07,240
I'm not drowning in death. God
Damn, that's dark. I mean, fuck bro.

1756
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:11,100
I live right on. You know I
live on the marina. The way
they sold me. They're like,

1757
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:16,060
you have a tsunami comes thing. I said,
really? There? Yeah, I'll take it tilts.

1758
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:20,760
I'll take it, save all that
shit. It's going to fill up
with water. [inaudible] up,

1759
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:25,030
man. The real tsunami, the
real bad motherfuckers.

1760
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:29,860
It's going to drown it.
It's going to be all under water,

1761
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:33,580
like the idea of like 500
feet of water up and down.

1762
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:37,110
That's nothing in the history of
the world. That shit's happened.

1763
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:41,910
Thousands sometimes role.
Just how you're not a real estate fucks.

1764
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:43,870
Say I'd be like,
look,

1765
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:47,200
what you really want to do is you want
to be on top of the mountain looking down

1766
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:51,730
and you want to have a raft up there.
Yeah, man. You got to have like Noah art.

1767
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,640
I don't know if that's a reason not to
live by the beach. No beach town side.

1768
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,920
It's still awesome.
If you were like super baller,

1769
01:43:57,921 --> 01:44:01,340
like Richard Branson type character,
you really ideally want to houses.

1770
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:04,130
You want a house at the top of
the mountain. Now you want three,

1771
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:05,630
you want a house at the
top of the mountain,

1772
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:08,810
you want to fat place in the city
and then you want a spot on the wall.

1773
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:09,440
You want to do that.

1774
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,640
If you're going to be a fucking super
baller scrooge McDuck style. Yeah you,

1775
01:44:13,641 --> 01:44:15,650
but you got to have like,
you know,

1776
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:19,880
fucking Shell oil type money
if you want to do it right.

1777
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:24,630
A lot of money and having three mansions.
I'm not talking about mansions.

1778
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,640
Maybe have a condo downtown like a
dope ass penthouse. That's a good move.

1779
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:30,110
Yeah man.
I'm a,

1780
01:44:30,111 --> 01:44:34,160
I'm not a big fan of living downtown
because the God damn traffic,

1781
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:38,210
but you know, it's tough man. It's brutal.

1782
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:42,080
It's brutal to get downtown's row
ruthless. But I would never live down,

1783
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:43,520
but it's kind, Kinda dope. Like,

1784
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:47,670
like you could walk around downtown now
and it's like he's cleaning up and ls

1785
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:50,600
putting a ton of money into it. They
want it to be like the hot new hot spot.

1786
01:44:50,601 --> 01:44:52,610
So it's a good place to buy it.
They got to kill bums.

1787
01:44:53,190 --> 01:44:56,300
There's only one way they're
going to have to kill some bumps.

1788
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,100
What the fuck you sit. We're kidding
folks. We're not kidding. Well,

1789
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:03,080
I'm not going to have crappy value.
We don't have to get rid of them. No,

1790
01:45:03,081 --> 01:45:05,000
I'm just kidding. This guy, first of all,

1791
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:07,430
this dude from Canada
is a mother fucker dude.

1792
01:45:07,431 --> 01:45:12,290
The guy in the black shorts is he from
Canada? 22 two and he's bad ass man.

1793
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:15,800
This is a tough fight that other time
that the other two is taking some serious

1794
01:45:15,801 --> 01:45:20,720
body shots. Third round here.
Um, I just think that uh,

1795
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:24,110
the bump thing is, it's all
bullshit aside. You know,

1796
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,720
obviously I don't think you should
kill him, but when you look,

1797
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:27,531
you stop and look at it.

1798
01:45:27,531 --> 01:45:32,531
If it's a horrible indictment of how
flawed our current system of community is,

1799
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:37,070
that our community allows people to get
so disenfranchised, there's an entire,

1800
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:42,260
like a whole ecosystem of people
in downtown La. I get that.

1801
01:45:42,290 --> 01:45:45,620
I look at it and they make me sad when
people don't know what we're talking

1802
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:47,990
about.
Like if they'd ever seen skid row,

1803
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:49,880
like these people that are
listening to us like, oh,

1804
01:45:49,881 --> 01:45:53,240
you're being so mean about homeless
people. It's is a different thing.

1805
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,410
It's like walking dead.

1806
01:45:54,411 --> 01:45:59,411
But imagine all the zombies in one place
and they will eat your dick off for

1807
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,610
crack. It is really crazy. It's,

1808
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:05,720
it's one of the craziest things you'll
ever say that there's a ton of them in

1809
01:46:05,721 --> 01:46:09,830
Venice to man. Oh yeah. Tom In Venice.
Yeah. They get uncomfortable too.

1810
01:46:09,831 --> 01:46:14,480
And you're out those uh, Venice beach
spots when they gather and you know,

1811
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:18,190
they want money from tourists
so they start bagging. Yeah.
It's, it's rough. Well,

1812
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,030
it was a lot of crazy people.
That's really what it is.

1813
01:46:20,031 --> 01:46:24,680
It's a mental health issue that gets
thrown around a lot for everything. Right.

1814
01:46:24,681 --> 01:46:29,210
I think some of our mental health, I think
some were just like, fuck, fuck it man.

1815
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:30,080
Yep.

1816
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:35,080
I think also though saying fuck it though
is a bit of a mental health issue or

1817
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:39,140
is it just called giving up?
I think even that is mental health.

1818
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:41,930
Like don't you think it's
healthy to have good friends?

1819
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:45,170
It's healthy to be a good friend.
It's healthy to be in love.

1820
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:50,010
It's healthy to be fulfilled
by your pursuits in life,
whether it is a, you know,

1821
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:54,110
your artistic pursuits or
athletic pursuits or your
career pursuits, those are,

1822
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:58,260
that's a health issues. It's like
isn't it healthy to exercise? Right?

1823
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:01,290
That's a physical health issue actually.
He doesn't,

1824
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:03,620
he doesn't exercise well then he's nice,
right?

1825
01:47:03,870 --> 01:47:06,540
But when you talk and
consider physical health,

1826
01:47:06,541 --> 01:47:08,970
physical health is dependent upon choices.

1827
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:14,150
It's dependent upon dietary choices and
it's dependent upon choices that you

1828
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:17,700
make as far as like how much exercise
you do and that's your health.

1829
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:20,490
I think mental health is the same thing.

1830
01:47:20,670 --> 01:47:23,850
I think there's aspects of mental
health that are undeniable,

1831
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:26,220
just like these aspects of physical
health that are undeniable.

1832
01:47:26,221 --> 01:47:30,250
There's people that are born with
horrible physical diseases and, and, and,

1833
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:34,010
and there's not much they can do
it physically to overcome those.

1834
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:39,140
And there's all sorts of deformities and
all sorts of real problems that people

1835
01:47:39,211 --> 01:47:40,380
have that are physical.

1836
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,560
But then there's also people that are
just fucking overeating lazy fucks and

1837
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:49,630
they develop heart disease. Well isn't
that a physical health issue? Well,

1838
01:47:49,631 --> 01:47:53,070
it most certainly is and
have that physical health
health issue manifests itself

1839
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:57,330
through choices and decisions and your
actions and so then it becomes a mental

1840
01:47:57,331 --> 01:47:59,640
health issue as well.
So it's a physical health issue,

1841
01:47:59,641 --> 01:48:02,940
but it's also a mental health
issue because it's your
mental health that is out

1842
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:05,880
of line that allows your physical
health that gets so fucked up,

1843
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:08,850
but also sort of people's
experiences in life.

1844
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:13,110
I don't know if I take to mental a mental
health issue where they have an issue

1845
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:15,660
with their brain, you know what I'm
saying? Where it's chemically different.

1846
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:19,290
Sometimes they might not have had the
same opportunities as other people and

1847
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:22,860
just say, listen man, fuck this.
Like maybe they lost a family member.

1848
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:26,160
Maybe they lost their job and they're
thinking, oh, I'm sick of this shit man.

1849
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,630
Yeah, that's true. Some of that.

1850
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:32,660
But I think that could be considered
a mental health issue. I think t's,

1851
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:36,210
I think prom with people chalk it up.
Everything has mental health like these,

1852
01:48:36,211 --> 01:48:39,330
like these uh, shooters, these
calls or these random shooters.

1853
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,670
It's always a mental
health thing. Yes, right.

1854
01:48:41,790 --> 01:48:45,120
Oh well it's a mental thing
and that's an easy get away.

1855
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:49,320
They might just be fucked up
man. Bad people. Some things up.

1856
01:48:49,321 --> 01:48:51,360
If people are just evil, man, we could,

1857
01:48:51,361 --> 01:48:56,310
but that also is I think
could be considered a mental
health issue and I think

1858
01:48:56,311 --> 01:48:57,540
the word mental health,

1859
01:48:57,541 --> 01:49:02,541
we get thrown around like we look at
health and disease and issues like that or

1860
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:06,330
where you're not, you're not balanced
in an order. We look at it like, oh,

1861
01:49:06,331 --> 01:49:09,930
Jimmy caught gonorrhea. Well that guy's
got a disease he needs to penicillin.

1862
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:14,640
But if you're just a lazy fuck that
eats like Shit and eventually your heart

1863
01:49:14,641 --> 01:49:15,240
gives out.

1864
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:20,010
You have heart disease and
that is a physical disorder.

1865
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:24,120
It's a physical disorder that came from
you not having discipline for whatever

1866
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:27,990
reason, making poor choices so it
manifests itself in a physical condition.

1867
01:49:27,991 --> 01:49:29,670
It can also manifest itself in a,

1868
01:49:29,671 --> 01:49:34,020
in a a mental condition because you could
be at a point where we'd given up on

1869
01:49:34,021 --> 01:49:35,100
that feed.
Is that what's going on?

1870
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:39,240
I got a lot of messages just saying that
that was the prelims and the act main

1871
01:49:39,241 --> 01:49:42,600
card is going on now alive.
Oh, nice. On the West.

1872
01:49:42,601 --> 01:49:45,930
So it was just the prelims line website
and that was what it was playing.

1873
01:49:45,931 --> 01:49:49,580
So the main car supposedly is live now.
Oh,

1874
01:49:49,581 --> 01:49:51,880
so what we were when they were
saying that we were watching,

1875
01:49:51,881 --> 01:49:56,080
we were watching the prelims. Yes.
Okay. That makes sense. So, um, okay,

1876
01:49:56,081 --> 01:49:59,740
now that we have that, let's put
up the card on the, okay, cool. Um,

1877
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:05,050
but I think the word disease is an issue
and the word health is an issue because

1878
01:50:05,051 --> 01:50:09,940
it's, it's really like we categorize
things like health and disease and we,

1879
01:50:09,941 --> 01:50:13,450
we, we like, we'd get real
rigid with how we, uh,

1880
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:17,500
look at them and we look at things
like health and these people that have

1881
01:50:17,501 --> 01:50:20,770
disorders. When you have addictions,
when you have compulsion's,

1882
01:50:20,771 --> 01:50:25,771
when you have a negative behavior that
you can't help but keep continuing to

1883
01:50:25,811 --> 01:50:28,420
repeat over and over again,
self sabotaging behavior,

1884
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:32,680
that is a mental health issue.
When you have obsessive,

1885
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:36,040
like you're a stalker, you start stalking
a girl, you won't leave her alone.

1886
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:37,660
You're obsessed with her.
Check her Facebook,

1887
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:40,990
her like that's that
obsession is a disorder.

1888
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,360
Like you could call it
a mental health issue.

1889
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:47,320
You could call it as you could call it
behavioral malfunction. True. But it's,

1890
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:51,010
you're not healthy mentally and it,
so it is a mental health issue.

1891
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:56,160
Like if you go into a school and you
shoot people 100% you have a mental health

1892
01:50:56,651 --> 01:50:57,360
issue,

1893
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:02,360
100% 100% the issue is you can't be
mentally healthy and want to go and shoot

1894
01:51:03,701 --> 01:51:05,440
random people just so
people know your name.

1895
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:09,610
You can't want that if you want
that you are mentally unwell.

1896
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:13,720
And so I think when we look at
things like, oh, it's not his fault,

1897
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,100
he has a mental health disorder.
Oh that's just a cop out. Well, no,

1898
01:51:18,190 --> 01:51:21,520
he's responsible for whatever
that disorder his butt.

1899
01:51:21,521 --> 01:51:25,390
He most certainly has a disorder. Like
when someone's a rapist, the bill Cosby,

1900
01:51:25,450 --> 01:51:29,230
okay, he's got a mental health
issue. It doesn't exonerate him.

1901
01:51:29,410 --> 01:51:32,260
It doesn't say that he should be free.
And no one should,

1902
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,570
no one should prosecute him.
And you know,

1903
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:39,520
he should somehow or another be
treated instead of a locked up.

1904
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:41,920
No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

1905
01:51:41,950 --> 01:51:46,810
But you have to have a mental health
issue in order to drug women and fuck them

1906
01:51:46,811 --> 01:51:47,680
when they were unconscious.

1907
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:52,890
You have to have a total disconnect
for feeling about that woman's health,

1908
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:58,540
her safety, her, her physical
solidarity or, or, or,

1909
01:51:58,730 --> 01:52:03,490
or physical, um, uh, her, her ability to,

1910
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:08,510
to like own her own body and own
her own consciousness. Like to,

1911
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:13,060
for you to want to bypass that with a
pill so you could stick your Dick in her

1912
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:16,600
like you have to be mentally, he was
raised that way. It doesn't matter.

1913
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:18,640
It doesn't matter because you even,

1914
01:52:18,670 --> 01:52:22,210
you can be mentally raised to be
racist like we were talking before.

1915
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:26,980
Or you can be raised in a mental pattern
where you're homophobic though all

1916
01:52:26,981 --> 01:52:31,330
those are absolutely a hundred percent
possible. But at the end of the day,

1917
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:34,210
you're still mentally unwell.

1918
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:37,300
Like you're mentally unwell
because of the way you were raised,

1919
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:40,780
your mentally unwell in spite of the
way you were raised. It doesn't matter.

1920
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:42,810
You're mentally unwell.
Like,

1921
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:46,850
and I think if we look
at behavior like overall,

1922
01:52:46,851 --> 01:52:51,200
like what is conducive to a happy
experience for you and the people that you

1923
01:52:51,201 --> 01:52:51,980
encounter,

1924
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:56,270
what is conducive to you being
fulfilled in your life and having great

1925
01:52:56,271 --> 01:52:59,630
friendships and great relationships.
What is conducive to that? Well,

1926
01:52:59,631 --> 01:53:03,800
if you move towards that and he tried to
eliminate all the errors that you keep

1927
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:07,670
repeating and making and you recognize
those that's healthy, that's healthy.

1928
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:09,710
Well this is the thing
though. So if, if I,

1929
01:53:09,711 --> 01:53:13,340
if I am a of mental health issues,

1930
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:17,030
there's a lot of negative that
comes with it, right? So, so if I,

1931
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:20,930
whatever have this weird,
uh, inclination to,

1932
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:24,580
to molest boys or whatever for whatever
reason, there you will for whatever,

1933
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:27,610
whatever it is. Or to rape
girls. Yeah. Right, right.

1934
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:30,020
It's going to be tough to get help,
right?

1935
01:53:30,021 --> 01:53:32,270
Because you have this negative
connotation with that. Sure.

1936
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:35,480
So that's why it keeps going on.
Well, that's certainly a part of it.

1937
01:53:35,481 --> 01:53:38,900
And also there's not, and I'm not
promoting any of this fucking bullshit,

1938
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:42,200
but I'm just saying there's no
like safe house for them. Right?

1939
01:53:42,201 --> 01:53:43,880
Like they can't go be
like, hey man, listen,

1940
01:53:43,881 --> 01:53:47,240
I have this weird fantasy where I
fucking loved him. Less little kids,

1941
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,610
people like Wyatt. You know what
I'm saying? Like there's no,

1942
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,870
there's no outlet for
him. It's true. I mean,

1943
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:56,150
to have a fantasy where you victimized
small children is like the most taboo and

1944
01:53:56,151 --> 01:53:59,630
forbidden fantasy ever. You can't even
pee jerk off to that. But if you hadn't,

1945
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:03,520
can't even vote 10, you're super
fucked. Well, say if a guy, um,

1946
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:06,140
say if you're married,
right? And uh, you know,

1947
01:54:06,141 --> 01:54:08,120
maybe your wife puts on a few pounds,

1948
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:10,790
but you want to stay married and
you don't want to cheat on her.

1949
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:12,930
And yet she doesn't want
to have sex anymore.

1950
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:17,950
Maybe she's older and she
gets the menopause and you
just go into your garage or

1951
01:54:18,911 --> 01:54:22,090
wherever the fuck you keep your porn and
you whack going off every now and then

1952
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:24,890
just went off to stay sane.
Yeah, everything else is great,

1953
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,300
but when you're closing your eyes,

1954
01:54:26,301 --> 01:54:27,860
you're whacking off and
you're looking at porn,

1955
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:30,660
you're looking at some dirty girl
that tattoo on her lower back,

1956
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:34,280
she sucking Dick and you
just want to her sure.

1957
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:38,750
See you get, you're allowed to indulge
those fantasies. If you're a man,

1958
01:54:38,751 --> 01:54:43,751
like if you're a guy was
no chance whatsoever of a
banging some super hot porn

1959
01:54:44,741 --> 01:54:48,290
star 10 yeah. You could still jerk
off watching her. Fuck you can.

1960
01:54:48,291 --> 01:54:49,760
So that's what you like.
Yeah.

1961
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:53,570
You could still jerk off watching
someone just hold her hair and just mouth

1962
01:54:53,571 --> 01:54:56,600
fucker.
You can do that and no repercussions.

1963
01:54:56,630 --> 01:54:58,640
Like you can never have
sex with that girl ever,

1964
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:01,970
but you could jerk off to her having
sex and have no repercussions.

1965
01:55:01,971 --> 01:55:06,080
That's your taste. Right? But if your
taste is like young boys, like twinks,

1966
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:11,090
like 15 year old tanks, you, you
have nothing. Everything is illegal.

1967
01:55:11,410 --> 01:55:14,720
It doesn't even mean that you want to go
out and have sex with those young boys

1968
01:55:14,970 --> 01:55:18,800
like, or you plan on having sex with us
was like, you can't even jerk off to them.

1969
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:23,980
So what leads me to question like what
happens if in the future they figure out

1970
01:55:24,201 --> 01:55:25,370
virtual reality,

1971
01:55:25,610 --> 01:55:30,320
like they get virtual reality to
a point where it's just you can't,

1972
01:55:30,321 --> 01:55:32,450
anything goes,
anything goes in virtual reality.

1973
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:35,840
So you have these artificial
young boys that blow you.

1974
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,780
Will that be illegal because
no one's getting hurt there.

1975
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:43,530
These artificial boys are made a three
d polygons are connected together with

1976
01:55:43,531 --> 01:55:44,820
some visual

1977
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:49,110
video effects engine. It's harder
because it satisfies the urge. Right?

1978
01:55:49,111 --> 01:55:51,930
And they're not doing to
actual humans. Yeah. Right.

1979
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:56,280
But eight that urge though, you want
to cut it out of the society. Okay.

1980
01:55:56,281 --> 01:56:00,120
So what are you doing it with these
guys? All right. I'm with you.

1981
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:04,530
Them in the bank. You might
have to them in the bum. They
met him. Bumps. See Ya. I,

1982
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:08,580
I wish there was a way to just rewire
you. I mean, I wish, I mean in all,

1983
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,970
I bet a lot of people who
have all those issues,

1984
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:15,150
those real dark people who are unhappy,

1985
01:56:15,151 --> 01:56:18,980
you don't think they wish they could
be rewired. Sure. Man. Even gamblers,

1986
01:56:18,981 --> 01:56:22,540
you ever meet? I'll take some great
wine. Rambler. Few things. Yeah.

1987
01:56:23,330 --> 01:56:25,710
You know what's really
interesting, someone was
talking to me about this stuff,

1988
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:30,730
fat guy that I know and his wife was
saying that it's Kinda crazy because first

1989
01:56:32,101 --> 01:56:33,450
of all, that guy, what's
his name, halls and,

1990
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:38,070
and is the biggest 185 pounds a large
human because gigantic for one 85.

1991
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:41,880
I liked, I liked Michael Page.
Michael, he's fun to watch.

1992
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:45,600
His talents are almost wasted in that
division that he's competing against.

1993
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,380
He needs to fight like a much
higher caliber of fighter.

1994
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:52,680
He's collecting paychecks. What was I
just saying? We're just talking about, oh,

1995
01:56:52,681 --> 01:56:55,200
you have a fat friend.
Oh. And his wife was like,

1996
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:58,200
here's the difference between
being addicted to anything else.

1997
01:56:58,201 --> 01:57:02,070
Like if you're addicted to cigarettes,
you stopped smoking cigarettes and then,

1998
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:05,010
you know, he kicked the habit.
But if you're addicted to food,

1999
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:09,910
you have to eat food. It's a legit
boy. It was a very legit point.

2000
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:13,870
I thought about it. I want to,
Whoa, it's a super legit point.

2001
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:18,690
Obviously I don't have food issues. I'm
known have, um, you know, um, a real, uh,

2002
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:23,190
food addiction. But over the last
nine days, I quit eating sugar,

2003
01:57:23,730 --> 01:57:27,420
lost six pounds. Now as of
today, six fucking pounds.

2004
01:57:27,750 --> 01:57:31,430
And I'm not trying like, I'm just
eating normal. I'm doing the same.

2005
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:34,590
Doing more cardio or anything? Nope.
Same amount. Everything's the same.

2006
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:37,950
Everything's the same.
But you're getting your sugar from where?

2007
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:42,060
From the bucket name all
the mango things. Yeah.

2008
01:57:42,061 --> 01:57:46,240
I thought you were c two o c two
delicious and sweet. But it's,

2009
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:49,770
that's natural. That's just
the coconut from fruit or
whatever. Yeah. Fruits. Fine.

2010
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:53,730
I've been eating bananas every
day and I eat oranges and apples.

2011
01:57:53,731 --> 01:57:56,790
I eat a lot of fruit, but uh,
like those mangoes. So it's Chili.

2012
01:57:56,791 --> 01:58:00,090
Mangoes are so God damn good.
Heaven ain't much. I came in,

2013
01:58:00,091 --> 01:58:04,670
I felt that bad enough that you know what?
Yo Lo, fuck this. When's the last area?

2014
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:06,690
Lo? I don't know why that
came out of my mouth.

2015
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:09,000
I don't know why that came out
of my mouth. I don't even talk.

2016
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:11,100
Lights got added sugar.
That's the problem.

2017
01:58:11,101 --> 01:58:13,710
It's not just the sugar
from the dried mangoes.

2018
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:18,090
Did they put sugar and then
the chili sauce together?

2019
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:22,200
The chippy Chili Pepper together, mangoes
from heavens. When I say heaven dust,

2020
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:24,360
oh you mean sugar,
I'm fucking addicted man.

2021
01:58:24,361 --> 01:58:26,900
So I go nine days in and I
decided I'm going on a month.

2022
01:58:26,901 --> 01:58:29,790
Then I'm gonna see what happens when I
make it to a month. You know what though?

2023
01:58:29,791 --> 01:58:33,240
You're a real discipline type of dude who
can do that. You know what I'm saying?

2024
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:36,600
Like you, you stick something
in your fucking sticking to it.

2025
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,850
One thing I know about you,
I definitely do,

2026
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:41,470
but what I'm thinking is
why I'm doing this. I'm man,

2027
01:58:41,471 --> 01:58:45,220
I don't even have an issue and this
is like overwhelming my thoughts.

2028
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:46,630
Like a lot of the day,

2029
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:51,460
like where I see like a hot dog with a
nice white roll on a white bun to white

2030
01:58:51,461 --> 01:58:53,830
bread. I'm not eating that
shit. I'm not eating that.

2031
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:56,650
So I see that hot dog with
fucking Sauerkraut on it. Ooh,

2032
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,780
you ever go to home depot and they have
the hot dog cart in front of Home Depot.

2033
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:03,400
All those things are so fucking
good mother fucker to get me.

2034
01:59:03,401 --> 01:59:05,200
I'm going to have for our hammer.
I'm trying not to hammer.

2035
01:59:05,201 --> 01:59:06,430
I'm not trying to buy a hot dog too.

2036
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:10,300
I ended up walking out what
that hot dog and a Chiro.

2037
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:15,910
They get that Cheryl and I'm like, fuck
it. I'll, you know what gets me with them.

2038
01:59:15,911 --> 01:59:20,380
God Damn Churros the Charles and the
funnel cakes and Mickey mouse ears on and

2039
01:59:20,381 --> 01:59:24,070
Shit feeling like, Shit, I'm done dude.
I'm not no, no sugar for this month.

2040
01:59:24,071 --> 01:59:25,210
So I'm gonna see what happens.

2041
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:29,020
And at the end of the month I'm going
to see how I feel and what I look like.

2042
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:29,861
This is the helped me,

2043
01:59:29,861 --> 01:59:32,560
but is I'm assuming that everyone
in your household this way,

2044
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:34,880
because if they're not, you're
going to have troubles. Now,

2045
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:38,890
I used to date a girl who, uh, I
was trying to eat real healthy,

2046
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:42,820
but she literally had crazy genetic.
She would eat fast food every night.

2047
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:46,690
So I'd be like eating fucking,
you know, Broccoli and chicken.

2048
01:59:46,691 --> 01:59:49,600
She's balls deep in a 12 piece chicken
nugget. You know what I'm saying?

2049
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:54,010
It's tough, man. It is. But
when I get it in my head,

2050
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:57,280
it doesn't matter. You could
eat pizza right in front of
it. A beast with it. Well,

2051
01:59:57,281 --> 02:00:00,340
I just, I have switches.
I have like, okay,

2052
02:00:00,341 --> 02:00:04,180
now you don't do this anymore and that's
it. And once I don't do that anymore,

2053
02:00:04,181 --> 02:00:07,750
I don't do that anymore because
then if I do do it, if I give in,

2054
02:00:07,930 --> 02:00:10,360
that'll permeate itself from
the rest of my life. That'll,

2055
02:00:10,361 --> 02:00:15,040
that'll leak itself into my other
comedy leak itself into my workouts.

2056
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:17,800
It'll leak itself in everything
you do that with your social life.

2057
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,150
If someone fucked you over and you're
like your dad to me off, as soon as,

2058
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:24,550
as soon as they like,

2059
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:29,770
you will run into people that will like
either sabotage you or do a bad business

2060
02:00:30,161 --> 02:00:33,970
deal with you or try to fuck you in some
way. And you know, you can't hate him.

2061
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:38,800
I forgive him like as a person,
but I won't associate with them anymore.

2062
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:43,120
No. Yeah, there's no, yeah, no, no, no.

2063
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:47,050
You mean you'd have to like have
some insane apology with the,

2064
02:00:47,051 --> 02:00:48,880
a real explanation and then,
you know,

2065
02:00:48,881 --> 02:00:51,430
we'd probably have to work our way
back to a French or she'll slow,

2066
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:54,790
but when someone fucks you over,
I can't,

2067
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:59,140
you can't tolerate that because those
people become problems. And those people,

2068
02:00:59,141 --> 02:01:03,640
that's a pattern that like, like if
you, uh, if you have a friend and like,

2069
02:01:03,641 --> 02:01:06,850
especially like you hear about friends
going into business together and then

2070
02:01:06,851 --> 02:01:10,750
like they start a restaurant or something
and one guy fucks off with the cash

2071
02:01:10,751 --> 02:01:15,490
and they wind up fighting each other.
My stepdad and his, uh, his, um,

2072
02:01:16,090 --> 02:01:19,690
he had a business partner
and architectural firm and
they beat each other up one

2073
02:01:19,691 --> 02:01:23,710
day. Should it be each other? Like he
came home, he had a black eye and he was,

2074
02:01:23,770 --> 02:01:27,550
you know, in his forties and
I was a kid. I was like, what?
First of all, I was like,

2075
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:32,880
I was fighting back down to zero skills.
It's like this,

2076
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:34,930
like what did this
fight look like between,

2077
02:01:34,931 --> 02:01:38,860
cause I knew his basic guess Stepdad or
worse, but it's like he's a good guy.

2078
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:41,930
He's in a bad person, but I knew
the guy fought with two. I'm like,

2079
02:01:41,931 --> 02:01:45,350
that's even more ridiculous that that
guy gave you a black eye because that has

2080
02:01:45,351 --> 02:01:48,200
to be there.
It was so bad.

2081
02:01:48,230 --> 02:01:51,880
Well it was a very complicated
situation where they had uh,

2082
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:54,680
government contracts and then,
um,

2083
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:59,110
the government lost money. Um,
like there was like a d uh,

2084
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:02,720
there was a recession and during the
recession they cancel a lot of their

2085
02:02:02,721 --> 02:02:03,351
contracts.

2086
02:02:03,351 --> 02:02:07,280
And so these guys had put all this time
and work and effort into these projects

2087
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:11,270
and the projects were pulled out from
under them and all their investment was

2088
02:02:11,271 --> 02:02:14,960
done super fun. It was really
bad. And you know, they all,

2089
02:02:15,530 --> 02:02:19,160
I'm sure there was a lot of blame on
both sides and who knows what the fuck

2090
02:02:19,161 --> 02:02:22,640
happened. But it's weird when you see
someone come home, your Stepdad gets,

2091
02:02:22,650 --> 02:02:26,520
got a black eye.
What earth?

2092
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:30,680
Like if I was braiding shop,
it'd be like, for sure.

2093
02:02:30,681 --> 02:02:35,030
Keep your hands up next time for sure.
Don't let them get that close to you.

2094
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:36,890
Talk my shit to each other.

2095
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:40,820
My Dad get in a fight when I
was 12 I'm not making this up.

2096
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:45,980
W whatever fucking cars. Right.
My Dad pulls in front of him.

2097
02:02:45,981 --> 02:02:49,160
He pulls it from my dad. He gets out.
My Dad goes, you want to fucking go?

2098
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:52,730
My Dad's like, oh no, like an
old school Irish boxer. Oh No.

2099
02:02:53,790 --> 02:02:57,110
I remember being like 10 or
11 being like, ah, fuck man.

2100
02:02:57,140 --> 02:03:00,350
See the problem with that is Nick
Diaz can actually fight like that.

2101
02:03:00,380 --> 02:03:02,800
Oh my dad makes off this dude.
Yeah.

2102
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:06,140
It was about to throw them off the side
of the highway and a leather jacket.

2103
02:03:06,141 --> 02:03:09,410
Oh No, I did not fuck around
when a guy stands out like that.

2104
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:12,140
So I was doing the old school boxing.
One of two things can happen.

2105
02:03:12,290 --> 02:03:15,650
He's trying to scare you off
or he's so good with his hands.

2106
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:20,250
He's just Kinda roll actually. Like what's
up dude? You want some? Yeah, man. Yeah,

2107
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:26,030
he was weird. I'll tell
you what, for real man,

2108
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:29,180
I remember my dad get out of
the car. I'm like, God dammit.

2109
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:32,120
And then my brother gets out, kicks,
guiding the balls from behind.

2110
02:03:32,410 --> 02:03:33,880
[inaudible] was probably 12 at the time.

2111
02:03:33,890 --> 02:03:38,150
He's Christ brother kicked a grown
man in the room in the balls.

2112
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:41,120
But that's when it gets really
dangerous when that kid gets involved,

2113
02:03:41,290 --> 02:03:43,250
own father becomes like super violent.

2114
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:46,010
Little Brown was doing what was
a little crying in the back seat.

2115
02:03:46,510 --> 02:03:50,150
How old were you? Probably like
10 or 11 crying in the back seat.

2116
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:56,520
Can't be trusted if she goes down.
Our nurse on my stepdad fight but it's,

2117
02:03:56,550 --> 02:03:59,330
I'm almost getting a fight once
we got in a minor car accident,

2118
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:02,860
like a little fender bender when I was
like eight or nine years old and I was as

2119
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:06,260
young kids and saw the car and they got
out swearing and yelling and I was like,

2120
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:09,860
oh no, I was so scared.
So skin, oh so scared.

2121
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:13,850
Cause he wasn't a tough guy either.
I was told me cry. So vulnerable,

2122
02:04:14,710 --> 02:04:15,950
prominent on might have.

2123
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:18,770
I don't think so cause I don't think
it got to the point where anybody hit

2124
02:04:18,771 --> 02:04:22,250
anybody. So I probably see,
I would definitely have
cried if they hit each other.

2125
02:04:22,251 --> 02:04:25,270
Yeah, I would've been terrified.
But that's how people die. You know,

2126
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,650
that's how people wind up killing
the whole family was real man,

2127
02:04:27,651 --> 02:04:29,780
knocked the guy out. The Guy
Falls, hits his head, you go,

2128
02:04:29,781 --> 02:04:32,700
we got to get rid of the family
and they just, they mark Burg wife,

2129
02:04:32,710 --> 02:04:37,040
free butter kids. That shit happens. You
know, you run into the wrong biker gang.

2130
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:41,220
True. They're messed up and trying
to prove their hardness for sure.

2131
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,090
Shit happens.
Carbon w you know you're the wrong race.

2132
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:47,640
You know you're a black guy and there's a,
you know,

2133
02:04:47,641 --> 02:04:51,440
you have a white girlfriend maybe. Who
the fuck knows man? Yeah man. Anything.

2134
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,460
You know.
How about transgender people?

2135
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:56,430
How about a transgender person gets in
the car accident with a bunch of fucking

2136
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:59,430
amped up dudes? Oh the fuck. Yeah. I mean,

2137
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:02,430
and you're on a dirt road somewhere
in the middle of nowhere and you just

2138
02:05:02,431 --> 02:05:07,020
decided to beat this guy. The
dude, I need a gun for real man.

2139
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,740
If you need any fucking, most
people really need a gun. Oh yeah.

2140
02:05:10,790 --> 02:05:15,300
That should alarm everybody because I can
fight. Yeah. People need it done right.

2141
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:18,810
It's a weird thing out there.
You could run it to the wrong people.

2142
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:22,710
And I've had people say that to me
like you're so paranoid, you know,

2143
02:05:22,711 --> 02:05:24,270
like why do you want
to learn martial arts?

2144
02:05:24,271 --> 02:05:26,850
Like I had this conversation with
Mark Marin wants about this, you know,

2145
02:05:26,851 --> 02:05:29,310
it's like well is that really
gonna Happen? Like you're
really worried about it.

2146
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:33,270
Like I've seen it like I know bad people.

2147
02:05:33,271 --> 02:05:37,140
I've seen people do bad things to be
blessing people hit people and they didn't

2148
02:05:37,141 --> 02:05:40,400
have to, I just can't be set the
same thing. Cause I asked him,

2149
02:05:40,401 --> 02:05:41,790
I'm like why should I have a gun?
He's like,

2150
02:05:41,791 --> 02:05:44,700
cause if shit goes down you want
to be prepared man. He goes,

2151
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:46,800
I never go anywhere without a gun.
He goes,

2152
02:05:46,801 --> 02:05:49,440
cause my wife and my
kids are depending on me.

2153
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:52,380
It was the 11th that guy has a gun and
yeah I have all these findings because

2154
02:05:52,381 --> 02:05:56,010
what the fuck am I going to do? He was,
I would never let them down. And he's,

2155
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:59,520
you know, world class fighter worldclass
and he's saying this, I was like, damn,

2156
02:05:59,521 --> 02:06:02,130
I need a gun. But he's always trying
to find one off the black market.

2157
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:04,950
Why would you from when you can
get one for Rome? And he was like,

2158
02:06:04,951 --> 02:06:08,910
get the fuck out it. Yeah. Don't even say
it was a joke. It was a Joe. Yeah. Lie.

2159
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:13,650
We lie. We just lied you 100%.
You can get one. You know,

2160
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:17,550
legally. You gotta feel easier
today. Yeah. It's not hard.

2161
02:06:18,550 --> 02:06:21,990
It's not hard. Wink, wink, wink. It's
not hard to get a gun in California.

2162
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:26,580
Paperwork and shit and not hard.
Do I have to take lessons? No,

2163
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:29,740
that's what's crazy. Whose phone is
that? Is that mine or yours? I wouldn't,

2164
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:32,700
definitely not mine. Um, you,

2165
02:06:32,780 --> 02:06:36,330
you don't have to like fill out
paperwork. At least he didn't. When I did,

2166
02:06:36,331 --> 02:06:38,550
I mean for paperwork as
far as like take a test,

2167
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:42,990
just kind of give me the goddamn thing.
It's not a hard like a hunter safety.

2168
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:47,370
Like when you take a, you take a
hunter safety course, um, you could,

2169
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:51,570
you do most of that online and
then you go and take like a class.

2170
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:53,510
Is there a weight class you,
I don't want to do that.

2171
02:06:53,850 --> 02:06:57,240
I'm going to go black market.
Is there a, is there a,

2172
02:06:57,450 --> 02:07:01,110
is there a waiting period for
what? For a guy full. Yes. Yes sir.

2173
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:05,280
I don't want to, I don't hand handgun
for any kind of firearm. There's a gun.

2174
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:07,830
There's a waiting period. They
have to find off. You're crazy.

2175
02:07:07,831 --> 02:07:11,130
They have to find out if you're a felon,
it's running from the law.

2176
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:13,750
They have to find out if you're
really Brendan shop, Bro,

2177
02:07:13,790 --> 02:07:18,720
give me a goddamn gun on me, bro.
Goddamn gun. You can get a gun, man.

2178
02:07:18,721 --> 02:07:22,650
It wouldn't be any problem. But Joey Diaz
can't get a gun. Joey Diaz is a felon.

2179
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:25,980
That makes sense. Yeah. If you're a felon,
you can't get a gun that, I mean that's,

2180
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:28,300
yeah, it's tricky man. Joey Diaz. But,

2181
02:07:28,330 --> 02:07:30,990
but makes sense if you just look
at his record on paper. Yeah.

2182
02:07:30,991 --> 02:07:33,870
It's tough to sell that
guy gun. Well, it's just,

2183
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:38,410
it seems like a questionable moe. Legit.
I mean, there's a reason for the law.

2184
02:07:38,690 --> 02:07:42,610
You will, you watch his podcast even watch
that. The morning thing that he does.

2185
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:46,620
We see a hoax that's high. The
morning joint. Yeah, it's he stays.

2186
02:07:46,621 --> 02:07:50,920
He's doing peer skill. Yes. I stopped
fucking pair of scout man. Yeah.

2187
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:55,000
Yeah, I'm gay. People get super excited
about it, but the excitement waned.

2188
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:57,430
It went away and I was like, yeah,
you know, I don't like it either.

2189
02:07:57,580 --> 02:08:01,480
And then Facebook's doing video streaming,
you know? Really? Yeah. They're all,

2190
02:08:01,481 --> 02:08:05,380
that's video streaming. That's right.
For out for however long you want. Dude,

2191
02:08:05,381 --> 02:08:07,270
we should start streaming on Facebook.

2192
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:12,460
That's what people are streaming and
cut out the middleman. Youtube. Well,

2193
02:08:12,461 --> 02:08:17,110
youtube is not bad to youtube. We make
money off youtube. Make money off ads.

2194
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:20,740
They play ads. No, for
sure. Podcast. Yeah,

2195
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:24,970
you can make money off of videos.
I make money off my haters videos.

2196
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:31,100
People make mean videos about me.
I put ads on them. Type Move Tropo.

2197
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:36,130
Yeah, type move, man. Shit.

2198
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:41,410
That's fun money. Keep on
keeping on. Ultimately. I mean,

2199
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:45,850
do you get that much hate though?
Shore. Really sure. I don't see it. Oh,

2200
02:08:45,851 --> 02:08:48,800
you got to look around. I don't see why
I don't look at the four people. Well,

2201
02:08:49,070 --> 02:08:53,830
if people hate every
show that is on the air,

2202
02:08:53,831 --> 02:08:56,110
there's going to be a certain percent.
It was like we were talking about,

2203
02:08:56,950 --> 02:09:00,060
you have a guy like, like that
was talking about that Milo, God,

2204
02:09:00,061 --> 02:09:03,160
but even you or even Callen
or anyone who I love,

2205
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:06,640
there's going to be a certain percentage
of people that fucking hate them.

2206
02:09:06,641 --> 02:09:09,550
Can't stand that.
It's just everybody's not for everybody.

2207
02:09:09,550 --> 02:09:11,680
That dude went down from
those fucking leg kicks, man.

2208
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:16,190
Some big boys tattooed on the left
is throwing some nasty leg kicks,

2209
02:09:16,191 --> 02:09:20,500
a white guys getting ate up.
He's down from those legs.

2210
02:09:20,590 --> 02:09:24,790
Really big boys. When you see
like good high level kickboxing,

2211
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:30,090
it makes you realize like a lot of the
kickboxing that you see in MMA especially

2212
02:09:30,191 --> 02:09:32,530
like like doesn't this level.
It just doesn't compare like this.

2213
02:09:32,531 --> 02:09:36,190
The one you're watching here,
these guys are going well to myself.

2214
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:40,990
Oh boy wants out. Yeah, he does.
He's one of my left leg kick.

2215
02:09:41,170 --> 02:09:43,960
Yeah, for sure. Don't bend over like,
yeah. When he kicked that left leg,

2216
02:09:43,961 --> 02:09:48,430
you can see that the thunder bolt, the
pain go up into his dome. Um, yeah.

2217
02:09:48,431 --> 02:09:49,660
People hate everything,
man.

2218
02:09:49,661 --> 02:09:51,520
There's somebody out there to
hates fucking led Zeppelin.

2219
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:53,410
Somebody out there that hates Bob Seger.

2220
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:57,280
There's something out there that it wants
Billy Joel to jump into the river and

2221
02:09:57,310 --> 02:10:01,120
drowns in his own feces as,
as long as it's 60 40 you're good.

2222
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:06,070
But if everyone hates you, you might just
be fuck. Why do you think 60 40 is good?

2223
02:10:06,510 --> 02:10:11,320
I think what's probably good is
like 80 20 or 70 30 but yeah,

2224
02:10:11,321 --> 02:10:16,250
it should be on the higher end for sure.
Oh, it's just a day. 60 40 is like, hmm,

2225
02:10:16,340 --> 02:10:20,830
maybe you need to tighten up your
fucking game. Tighten it up. You suck.

2226
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:22,000
And it's also like,

2227
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:26,800
there's like a problem with doing things
like a podcast because you're talking

2228
02:10:26,801 --> 02:10:30,820
and you might have an opinion that
there's not the same as the person who's

2229
02:10:30,821 --> 02:10:33,980
listened to and they can't talk
back and it's fucking frustrating.

2230
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:37,730
I think you're talking some shit about
like maybe some music that they love or

2231
02:10:37,731 --> 02:10:40,070
some food that they love
or whatever the fuck it is,

2232
02:10:40,071 --> 02:10:42,890
and they're listening and they
get mad. Like, I'm fucking tired.

2233
02:10:42,891 --> 02:10:46,630
Listening is bullshit. You
know, you fucking idiot. You
don't know shit. You fuck.

2234
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:50,810
And it's because it's an intimate
relationship, but it's very one way true.

2235
02:10:50,811 --> 02:10:51,600
But however,

2236
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:56,000
if you listen to a
hundred Joe Rogan podcast,

2237
02:10:56,030 --> 02:10:59,750
the Joe Rogan expansion isn't 101 of
them piss you off and then you become a

2238
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:01,580
hater off that one.
Well,

2239
02:11:01,581 --> 02:11:04,580
that's not lose my fucking number
necessarily have to be the case.

2240
02:11:04,581 --> 02:11:07,700
They can be a hater from the jump, you
know? Oh, well then there's just a hater.

2241
02:11:07,701 --> 02:11:10,160
Then they're looking for any reason.
It's just always punch.

2242
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:12,750
I'll tell you why I made the smartest
thing I ever did was that podcast before.

2243
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:17,330
I got so much hate. Fucking people
hated me or standing. I get it.

2244
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:21,470
I mean, I dressed like Jay Leno and
I get a fucking part in my head.

2245
02:11:21,471 --> 02:11:24,050
You know what I'm saying? Like
I get it. Part looks good. Yeah.

2246
02:11:24,051 --> 02:11:28,280
It depends who you ask. I like it. It's
like a giant Tobey Maguire. Just depends.

2247
02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:31,610
People that hate, you know they don't,
they don't matter. Yeah, I agree.

2248
02:11:31,611 --> 02:11:32,270
They don't matter.

2249
02:11:32,270 --> 02:11:34,880
I'm just saying the best thing I ever
did was the podcasts because people are

2250
02:11:34,881 --> 02:11:37,400
like, oh, he's not that
big of a dick. Yeah.

2251
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:41,090
Well they didn't understand a lot of like
when you would say things like this is

2252
02:11:41,091 --> 02:11:43,130
just your personality,
your sense of humor.

2253
02:11:43,131 --> 02:11:47,480
Like they think this guy really
thinks he's the shit. Well yes and no.

2254
02:11:47,890 --> 02:11:52,820
Like in a way. Yeah, but in another way.
No. Like he's having fun. This is fun.

2255
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:57,520
Yeah. What is this? Kevin Hart and
the soccer player? David Beckhams,

2256
02:11:57,560 --> 02:12:00,350
this soccer player, soccer player that
they always try to sneak in on us,

2257
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:05,870
not buying it. I get
it. I get it. He's cute.

2258
02:12:06,170 --> 02:12:10,830
Whatever. Well, whatever he is, get
outta here. It's not working. Oh,

2259
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:14,510
hello. I live in America land.
The free home of the brave.

2260
02:12:14,630 --> 02:12:18,740
We don't give a fuck who the world ping
pong champion is. Okay. But soccer bro,

2261
02:12:18,741 --> 02:12:22,760
same thing. He's the captain of
England for a long time. Darts.

2262
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:24,410
Who gives a fuck sick.

2263
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:28,280
His fate was sealed when he came
home to La to play with the Mexicans.

2264
02:12:28,990 --> 02:12:33,020
It's fate was sealed. They didn't
even give a fuck about them. A few,

2265
02:12:33,021 --> 02:12:37,910
like really a few really horny girls in
their thirties came down because they

2266
02:12:37,911 --> 02:12:42,740
were like super attracted him to work.
David back didn't work as work. So No,

2267
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:45,710
I'm saying it didn't work as far as like
getting us to buying the soccer did not

2268
02:12:45,711 --> 02:12:47,750
work.
Did Not paid them like one,

2269
02:12:47,751 --> 02:12:50,630
two gillion dollars didn't work
and like seven people showed up.

2270
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:54,290
No one give a feel like this is still
soccer. David Beckham is hot ticket.

2271
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:59,340
What we need is a recognizable face. We
got them too late. We got in too late.

2272
02:12:59,341 --> 02:13:01,040
It didn't matter if he's fucking man,

2273
02:13:01,041 --> 02:13:05,420
Diego Maradona in his and he's got a dick.
It's made out of gold.

2274
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:08,180
It doesn't matter. It's
still soccer, soccer stuff.

2275
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:12,920
If that guy was playing baseball,
Holy Shit Dude. Make a rod.

2276
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:17,510
You know? I mean the, the, the damage
that guy's like a rod do. I mean he would,

2277
02:13:17,511 --> 02:13:20,920
he would make that look silly. I
agree. He would be way better. He's,

2278
02:13:20,921 --> 02:13:25,600
he's a beautiful man. Oh, a piece tattooed
up too. But he doesn't have the build.

2279
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:28,850
It doesn't have to build because in
soccer it's like not important to have

2280
02:13:28,851 --> 02:13:32,020
muscles. You look, I
feel like some bitches be

2281
02:13:32,030 --> 02:13:35,910
the ones you don't want to fuck Trump
tie. Right? Oh, you're 100% yeah.

2282
02:13:36,030 --> 02:13:39,540
What do you want those? Nah. Well those
girls who want a guy that's tight,

2283
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:43,440
he's tired all the time. A guy like
a weak frame kind of gets neck pains.

2284
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:48,540
That's not what they want. No, that's not
what they want. They want a big brown. The

2285
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:55,650
super athlete. Dick, was that a, the
stoppage of that fight? Well, some girls,

2286
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:58,710
like some girls, like real skinny
dudes. Oh, in all seriousness,

2287
02:13:58,950 --> 02:14:02,510
some girls like dudes there look like
they're like don't eat. I think the,

2288
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,470
I saw a study where the,
where the the most appealing for women.

2289
02:14:07,471 --> 02:14:11,430
It was like kind of that dad bod, like
not a real rip dude, but not a fat dude.

2290
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:15,420
Some fat dude was trying to
get some pussy. It's bullshit.

2291
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:18,990
They're trying to and you hate whoever
wrote that gives you a rare deal and they

2292
02:14:18,991 --> 02:14:23,290
trying to get into the heads where they
say all the women out there and like,

2293
02:14:23,291 --> 02:14:25,300
like hypnotize them.
It's true.

2294
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:27,700
Well they already did it with the
fucking skinny bitches. Those,

2295
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:29,370
the models leave their coat racks.

2296
02:14:29,371 --> 02:14:31,890
Girls Look at those models and think
that's what they need to look like.

2297
02:14:31,940 --> 02:14:33,530
Other girls, not for guys. Right?

2298
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:35,610
But they think that's what
they're supposed to look like.

2299
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:39,270
If they just want it to look good
for guys, they would listen to us.

2300
02:14:39,330 --> 02:14:44,330
It's called honey doing squats and
they would be eating pasta or rice

2301
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:49,170
slideshows. Nice sour cream,
boom. Sauerkraut and pork chops,

2302
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:54,680
pork chop on the basic bitch
carb and carb up stairs, ruts.

2303
02:14:55,210 --> 02:14:57,780
You got to work those
glutamates and I says,

2304
02:14:58,110 --> 02:15:02,040
but to like women who like
look at those like really tall,

2305
02:15:02,041 --> 02:15:06,450
thin women, they think that that's,
that's what they have to achieve.

2306
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:12,120
Who's off fuck the fuck it's from
television man. It's from movies.

2307
02:15:12,121 --> 02:15:14,490
It's from books.
It's from magazines rather.

2308
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:16,950
It's so what do the guys
get the guys get we, we get,

2309
02:15:16,951 --> 02:15:20,910
we look towards what the Rock and
shit and muscle fitness. Yeah there's,

2310
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:25,940
there's that and then there's like a
ridiculously people like guys who are just

2311
02:15:27,691 --> 02:15:31,470
like super shredded six pack guys
are sitting around like almost like,

2312
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:36,480
you know that guy when he took that
photo shoot didn't eat for at least a day

2313
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:38,810
dehydrated himself to show his ass.

2314
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:41,460
He was on an eight week
funding cut to get the,

2315
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:46,410
when you see ads and guys look insanely
ripped and they have like chiseled six

2316
02:15:46,411 --> 02:15:51,390
packs either they're a freak of nature,
which is occasionally have those,

2317
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:55,230
a guy just looks insane no matter what
he does like the Kevin Randleman look,

2318
02:15:55,231 --> 02:15:59,610
you know, or oh you mean black people?
That's what I was going, sorry.

2319
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:01,420
Or sorry.
You,

2320
02:16:01,460 --> 02:16:06,460
you got a guy who is preparing for a
photo shoot who's in a very unhealthy and

2321
02:16:06,571 --> 02:16:11,340
dehydrated state. You know when you see
those guys for people that don't know,

2322
02:16:11,341 --> 02:16:16,341
if you watch bodybuilding and you see
those guys in there on that podium at that

2323
02:16:16,681 --> 02:16:19,870
stage and their flex in and
you see the strike [inaudible],

2324
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:23,430
they will black out.
If you made those guys run up a hill,

2325
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:26,930
they would literally black out and
fall down. They have a zero endurance.

2326
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:30,040
They would die.
If that competition lasted four days

2327
02:16:30,630 --> 02:16:32,140
dead, they'd be dead. They'd be dead.

2328
02:16:32,141 --> 02:16:35,500
If it was like an endurance thing where
you had to keep the competition going

2329
02:16:35,501 --> 02:16:38,980
over days and days, they would
be gone. It'd be gone. Yeah.

2330
02:16:38,981 --> 02:16:42,820
They don't look like that. Yeah, there's,
it's not healthy. You can't do that.

2331
02:16:42,821 --> 02:16:46,750
So if men had a body dysmorphia thing,

2332
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:48,300
it would be about being ripped.

2333
02:16:48,310 --> 02:16:52,100
Like that's why when that girl was fucking
with you 100% saying you were soft,

2334
02:16:52,101 --> 02:16:54,370
feel like, Ooh. She's like,

2335
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:59,440
she's saying you don't look like this
unrealistic person from these magazines

2336
02:16:59,530 --> 02:17:02,710
that I'm fingering myself too. And I said,
bitch, you don't look like Nicki Minaj.

2337
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:06,590
Where are we going to do? What are we
going to do? She wasn't even back then,

2338
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:09,040
that she wasn't popular. I didn't
really work. I probably said,

2339
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:13,360
did you guys have an argument over it?
No, I, I was just like, you were hurt. Uh,

2340
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:16,270
yeah. And I was like, I'm sad, sad.

2341
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:21,970
I state this girl used to tell me about
her ex boyfriend who she dated this big

2342
02:17:21,971 --> 02:17:23,050
giant body builder dude,

2343
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:27,010
that he used to pick her up and fuck
her up against the wall. And I'm like,

2344
02:17:27,430 --> 02:17:29,350
do you really think I want to hear that?
You don't want to know that.

2345
02:17:29,351 --> 02:17:32,380
So why do you want to tell
me about some big Guy?

2346
02:17:32,381 --> 02:17:35,710
He used to pick you up and fuck you
against the wall because I can pick you up

2347
02:17:35,711 --> 02:17:39,160
and fuck you against the wall. You're not
that big. Yeah. If you want to do that,

2348
02:17:39,161 --> 02:17:41,110
she'll, yeah, I'm strong
enough to do that.

2349
02:17:41,111 --> 02:17:42,910
But I don't need to know
about other than you.

2350
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:44,770
I like to pretend that
specific way that you can,

2351
02:17:44,771 --> 02:17:48,720
like I'm the first one and I don't
fucking picture any of that man.

2352
02:17:48,910 --> 02:17:51,700
I still a bit about that,
that every girl should say,

2353
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:55,390
is that what a Dick looks like? I'm
so glad I waited. That would be great.

2354
02:17:55,630 --> 02:17:57,220
That would be fucking brilliant.

2355
02:17:58,120 --> 02:18:01,000
Speaking is how I've always thought it
would be the best way to suck it and then

2356
02:18:01,001 --> 02:18:04,340
just do an ace five star Bordeaux style

2357
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:10,540
wifey and you're like, wait a minute.
How'd you learn? Ho I don't want to know.

2358
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:12,370
I don't want it.
I don't want to know.

2359
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:16,480
I'll just pretend you fucking
learned it off videos. Speaking of,

2360
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:21,080
speaking of Dicks, did you speaking
to take Justin Bieber's Dick?

2361
02:18:21,081 --> 02:18:25,900
Cause I get to bring up, I knew it. I
knew you were going to bring up a dude.

2362
02:18:26,140 --> 02:18:28,370
It's got a good Dick.
Good sized hoggy items.

2363
02:18:28,510 --> 02:18:30,980
Kids happy kids gets killing the game,
Bro.

2364
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:34,330
Think that maybe he like
pulled it out a little,

2365
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:37,270
fluffed it out a little blood flow,
knew everybody was going to see it.

2366
02:18:37,320 --> 02:18:39,610
You know he had that die piece
of a girl waiting on the couch,

2367
02:18:39,611 --> 02:18:43,060
so I'm sure he phoned her. He's Justin
Bieber and then was like, you know what?

2368
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:44,200
I'm going to get butt naked,

2369
02:18:44,201 --> 02:18:47,140
play some guitar on the balcony
and someone caught them like,

2370
02:18:47,141 --> 02:18:50,800
I don't think he's walking around with
that big old hug like that. That's true,

2371
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:54,460
but also making it though.
Maybe it doesn't give a fuck.

2372
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:57,790
Maybe when you have $300 million
and you're 19 you're like,

2373
02:18:57,820 --> 02:19:02,170
maybe I'll just go show my hog and
everybody for real dog out for a walk.

2374
02:19:02,171 --> 02:19:06,400
Especially
take feral hog out on the balcony,

2375
02:19:06,570 --> 02:19:10,590
this hog up for a little stroll and he's
got to think like as famous as he is at

2376
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:14,260
everything he does, he's constantly got
people. Try to take pictures of him.

2377
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:19,060
You'll have, if you have that hoggy
though, it's like fuck it. Why not? Yeah,

2378
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:23,290
let it, let it breathe, Bro. Let
it shine. Quit hating on the Dick.

2379
02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:28,100
That's a good point. Yeah.
Right pony. Legit point. Good
for him. See that something.

2380
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:33,110
Forget about squats. Forget about titty
implants, lips, then out a God damn thing.

2381
02:19:33,111 --> 02:19:34,250
You can do nothing.

2382
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:39,200
Not incredible that if you look at the
game when the genetic game, all right,

2383
02:19:40,030 --> 02:19:44,580
that one of the number one things is
dick size number one things. Number one,

2384
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:48,590
one of the number one things and that is
the one fucking nut that science can't

2385
02:19:48,591 --> 02:19:50,360
crack.
We could put a man on the moon.

2386
02:19:50,361 --> 02:19:54,560
We can send video from your fucking
cell phone to a dude in Australia.

2387
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:57,140
Instantaneously we could,

2388
02:19:57,170 --> 02:20:01,760
you can download Netflix
on the ride to the airport.

2389
02:20:02,090 --> 02:20:06,140
I mean, you're pulling movies
out of the sky. Hindu some shit.

2390
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:07,970
God Damn,
you can do some shit.

2391
02:20:07,970 --> 02:20:10,700
You could Skype with people there
on the other side of the planet.

2392
02:20:10,850 --> 02:20:14,120
Talk to them in real time.
Look at them like I'm looking at you.

2393
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:18,750
That's all possible. Can't fix that
Dick. Can't fix this arc, bro. Sorry.

2394
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:22,820
Uh, how, how, how close are
you getting close, close, man.

2395
02:20:22,821 --> 02:20:24,320
Nine o'clock and I'm just shit out.
Nothing.

2396
02:20:24,321 --> 02:20:27,620
We could cut the tendon in the bottom
and stretch it out, but I mean,

2397
02:20:28,930 --> 02:20:31,550
what can you do? Me a
half an inch. My Buddy,

2398
02:20:31,551 --> 02:20:33,440
I won't say his name
obviously has a small Dick.

2399
02:20:33,950 --> 02:20:37,970
I was at his house the other day awhile
ago, found a Dick extender for his girl.

2400
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:42,560
He saw, he saw me, he saw
me see this fucking adapter.

2401
02:20:42,561 --> 02:20:46,280
I sleep Damson I get it bro.
You coulda.

2402
02:20:46,310 --> 02:20:48,170
I coulda roasted them hard,

2403
02:20:48,410 --> 02:20:51,230
hard for having a tiny Dick
and having a Dick extender.

2404
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:54,370
Now when you say Dick extended like a
rubber Dick that you put on top of your

2405
02:20:54,380 --> 02:20:58,160
house to help your girl out cause
she here's a Tater tot dick.

2406
02:20:58,340 --> 02:21:03,170
So he put this thing on top of it.
It's a bomber,

2407
02:21:03,171 --> 02:21:08,120
bro. Me Being the nice guy just
looked at him, said, I get it.

2408
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:13,180
It's just carry on with your night.
It is what it is, man. Number man.

2409
02:21:13,210 --> 02:21:16,520
You can't do shit like if, if you're
real skinny, all right, whatever.

2410
02:21:16,521 --> 02:21:17,840
You can lift weights,
eat right.

2411
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:21,260
Maybe even by some steroids we can figure
some shit out. Like you said, your Dick.

2412
02:21:21,740 --> 02:21:24,830
We've got three d printing where we're
making all sorts of fucking new Oregon's

2413
02:21:24,831 --> 02:21:27,140
whatever the fuck you went. We
can't do dick. I got a question.

2414
02:21:27,530 --> 02:21:32,400
When you see like women that are
bodybuilders and they take steroids, they,

2415
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:35,120
their clit grows and then
it becomes like a dick.

2416
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:40,130
Do you think of a dude got on
some crazy ass fucking steroids?

2417
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:41,780
Would it make his dick grow?

2418
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:46,990
I'll give you got on some wild silver
back Mark Coleman in 1996 type steroids.

2419
02:21:48,690 --> 02:21:52,850
You know,
so some top of the fucking food chain,

2420
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:56,950
Alexander Karelin type shit.
Cause

2421
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:02,420
when you did grow up, you're like,
it would, I think it would grow.

2422
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:04,380
Your balls are going to shrivel up.
You raise it,

2423
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:06,080
but you take is going to be balls.

2424
02:22:06,510 --> 02:22:09,320
Your ball's going to have to step away
from the game. They're not doing the job.

2425
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:09,801
You know,

2426
02:22:09,801 --> 02:22:12,950
it's like what if you have a four cylinder
engine and your race car and someone

2427
02:22:12,951 --> 02:22:14,930
comes along and say, listen,
we've got one or two choices.

2428
02:22:14,931 --> 02:22:19,820
We can either take out this bitch ass
four cylinder and put in this ls seven six

2429
02:22:19,821 --> 02:22:24,770
point whatever leader, motherfucker,
you fire breathing dragon per engine.

2430
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:29,160
Or you can keep up with your bullshit
fuel economy in that Shitty Putt Putt.

2431
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:33,870
What are we going to do? We're here to
win races. While you take that crazy,

2432
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:38,550
you know, Mark Carr, Haga engine 2001,

2433
02:22:39,090 --> 02:22:41,790
you know mark the smashing
machines at his peak.

2434
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:44,940
They take some of that stuff.
You know what?

2435
02:22:45,020 --> 02:22:46,650
I don't know if your Dick grows longer.

2436
02:22:46,651 --> 02:22:48,930
I think it might get fat
or might get bigger too.

2437
02:22:48,931 --> 02:22:53,460
I mean just the girls click gets bigger.
How does this Dustin Jacoby next,

2438
02:22:53,461 --> 02:22:56,490
is that next? Oh, that's a good
fun. That's comin event. Beautiful.

2439
02:22:57,620 --> 02:23:02,520
Beautiful product. Yeah. He's a tough
kid, man. UFC too, right? Yes he did.

2440
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:05,520
Tough kid. Um, I wonder,

2441
02:23:05,870 --> 02:23:08,580
I w I think genetic engineering
is going to be where it's all at.

2442
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:11,100
That's what's going to,
we'll get there and pretty soon the rosy,

2443
02:23:11,101 --> 02:23:15,600
we walk around with Dicks to try
to asses big Dicks, giant deck,

2444
02:23:15,601 --> 02:23:20,250
seek noses. I just have this bit about
big Dick Pills that have big dick pills.

2445
02:23:20,251 --> 02:23:21,090
Really worked.

2446
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:24,990
It would take about 30 minutes for
the first guy to die of an overdose.

2447
02:23:25,490 --> 02:23:29,970
And then I go, cause no
one's going to take one. Oh,

2448
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:34,470
big Dick pills work it. Take one makes my
Dick groat. What if I take all of them,

2449
02:23:34,471 --> 02:23:38,760
puts out like how much do I take before
I die? And I'll take one less than that.

2450
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:42,580
Yeah. This fucking party
rolling. When I was like that,

2451
02:23:42,930 --> 02:23:46,770
there's a Jacoby fighting that guy that
we just saw that one earlier right there.

2452
02:23:47,550 --> 02:23:48,870
Jacoby is one of the guys are beating him.

2453
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:53,430
The guy that we saw earlier that a knocked
out Bang Bang on buyers are going to

2454
02:23:53,431 --> 02:23:57,630
be done. Yeah. And Wayne
parents, bad mother fucker.
He's very good. Super Athletic.

2455
02:23:57,660 --> 02:24:02,070
Real quick. Real sneaky man.
Really, really good athlete.

2456
02:24:02,071 --> 02:24:06,060
Good boxer too. He's a good boxer.
Before he, uh, got into kickboxing.

2457
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:08,360
He's a real good athlete too.

2458
02:24:08,380 --> 02:24:11,580
There's a lot of real good guys at high
level in this. So I mean you're, you're,

2459
02:24:11,630 --> 02:24:14,970
you know, a shilling. I wonder
how it works with glory.

2460
02:24:14,970 --> 02:24:19,340
Like are they contracted to Gloria
or they can't find anywhere else is,

2461
02:24:19,530 --> 02:24:22,140
but is it the, you know, the
bell, Tor and Gloria are friendly,

2462
02:24:22,141 --> 02:24:25,090
but can he fight elsewhere?
Can he fight over in Japan or,

2463
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:28,620
I don't know how it was contrary to
how those contracts are. I don't know.

2464
02:24:29,070 --> 02:24:32,580
They have glass. Be Tough. Paul
Daley too though that Paul Daley,

2465
02:24:33,090 --> 02:24:36,930
he's in both belter and like I said,
that makes sense for those guys.

2466
02:24:37,350 --> 02:24:40,220
It's just whatever it is.
For whatever reason,

2467
02:24:40,221 --> 02:24:43,260
Bella [inaudible] has been
around for a long time now. Okay.

2468
02:24:43,290 --> 02:24:46,710
It's been around for several years
and for whatever fucking reason,

2469
02:24:46,711 --> 02:24:51,420
it just has not caught on the way the
UFC caught on in like the early 2000.

2470
02:24:51,460 --> 02:24:54,410
Never. Well, that doesn't
make sense to me. They don't,

2471
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:56,850
they don't have the stars don't have the
depth. They don't have the production,

2472
02:24:56,880 --> 02:25:00,690
but they have don't have the money. Right.
They have Viacom money. Crazy money.

2473
02:25:00,750 --> 02:25:02,070
Why doesn't Viacom's say,
look,

2474
02:25:02,071 --> 02:25:06,780
we can either have this middling product
where we're always going to have like a

2475
02:25:06,781 --> 02:25:10,740
good guys like Phil Davis and
Tito Ortiz and you know, uh,

2476
02:25:10,910 --> 02:25:12,990
Sheila Manco and good fighters.

2477
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:17,900
Or we can go balls out and we can
get the really good guys like cool.

2478
02:25:18,170 --> 02:25:20,580
Like anybody,
anybody that's in contract negotiations.

2479
02:25:20,581 --> 02:25:23,920
Chad Mendez was talking to them
when Chad Mendez had, you know,

2480
02:25:23,921 --> 02:25:26,740
his contract is about to come up.
You don't think that he got offers?

2481
02:25:26,741 --> 02:25:28,990
I don't know what his deal was and I
don't think he was even thinking about

2482
02:25:28,991 --> 02:25:31,660
going, but you don't think
that rampage went over there?

2483
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:34,600
You know rampages in it will lawsuit
right now where he's got to figure out

2484
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:37,480
where he's going to fight again if
he is ever going to fight again.

2485
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:41,200
The UFC said they would let them go.
They said, yeah. They said, look,

2486
02:25:41,201 --> 02:25:44,950
we understand that you're in this
big lawsuit with Viacom and Viacom's

2487
02:25:44,951 --> 02:25:47,120
threatened to sue the UFC, said,
we'll let you go. You could.

2488
02:25:47,130 --> 02:25:50,440
You could go and fight for them and yeah,
it was cool for them to do that.

2489
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:53,380
I think they're offering to settle
[inaudible] Viacom's offering to settle.

2490
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,390
They want,
because they did violate his contract.

2491
02:25:55,630 --> 02:25:59,470
It did 100% he did fight
Fabio Maldonado afterwards.

2492
02:25:59,471 --> 02:26:00,640
The judge cleared him to fight.

2493
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:03,550
So I don't know what the
specifics of the case was,

2494
02:26:03,551 --> 02:26:05,960
but is the last that I read
was that you're looking at,

2495
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:10,420
you're looking at a 10 year investment
where we're going to have to get these

2496
02:26:10,421 --> 02:26:13,780
young guys from from the UFT and then
we're going to have to recruit the younger

2497
02:26:13,781 --> 02:26:16,690
guys who come up cause guys come
up through the ranks, right?

2498
02:26:16,691 --> 02:26:20,350
Like Phil Davis or the ultimate fighter
came up for the ultimate fighter.

2499
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:20,921
A bunch of guys.

2500
02:26:20,921 --> 02:26:24,100
Did they have to figure out kind of
their feeder system because right now all

2501
02:26:24,101 --> 02:26:27,970
they're doing is biting off the
UFC. Really? Let's be really, yeah,

2502
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,960
they're putting on B level c level
shows that the UFC put it on. T five,

2503
02:26:31,961 --> 02:26:32,860
six years ago,

2504
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:37,090
Phil Dave's kind of the first guy who's
in his prime who went there, you know.

2505
02:26:37,091 --> 02:26:41,140
But Phil, Dave's isn't a knockout artist.
I love Phil. Phil Davis just knocked out,

2506
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:44,920
uh, what's his face? Um, um, uh, hold,

2507
02:26:44,921 --> 02:26:49,390
hold the Karma Karma come home.
[inaudible] very good fighter.

2508
02:26:49,391 --> 02:26:52,860
And Davis beat the shit out. I
knocked him out. He looked nasty.

2509
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:57,010
No Davis fuck those dudes up. It's
like a, he turned a corner, you know,

2510
02:26:57,040 --> 02:27:00,640
and like did he turn to corner? Is
He fighting lesser competition? Both.

2511
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:01,960
I think both the,
I agree.

2512
02:27:01,961 --> 02:27:05,200
I think Davis is getting better and I
think Dave says in his prime and he's,

2513
02:27:05,470 --> 02:27:08,410
he's going to run that show for a very,
very long time.

2514
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:12,880
I was super impressed when he beat Glover.
I was like, wow, that is a big victory.

2515
02:27:12,881 --> 02:27:16,480
But I think Glover had a shit camp.
I really did feel big victory though.

2516
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:21,550
Whatever, whatever miscues Glover makes.
That's a huge Vic hundred percent. But um,

2517
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:23,980
I was disappointed when he lost a baiter.

2518
02:27:24,220 --> 02:27:27,280
But then when you see the way Bader beat
Rashad, you're like, look, Bader need,

2519
02:27:27,281 --> 02:27:29,680
you need to consider Bader
the way he is right now.

2520
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:33,630
Don't consider how Bader got knocked out
by Glover or bater that got knocked up.

2521
02:27:33,631 --> 02:27:37,510
I'm a cheetah five in a row. He's won
five in a row and look fucking real good.

2522
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:41,080
But guess what's next for
him though? You're a mother
fucker and Anthony Johnson.

2523
02:27:41,130 --> 02:27:44,650
Yeah. Couldn't be worst matchup. Is that
happening? Because I'm bill asked for.

2524
02:27:44,651 --> 02:27:46,570
I think that's what's next for him
cause what are you going to do?

2525
02:27:46,570 --> 02:27:49,210
You're going to sit out and
wait for John and DC to fight.

2526
02:27:49,211 --> 02:27:52,220
Who knows how long that's going to be.
They're going to make you fight rumble,

2527
02:27:52,310 --> 02:27:53,560
terrifying,
rumbles,

2528
02:27:53,561 --> 02:27:57,380
terrifying and I can't think
of worst matchup for Beta
and I love Beta, but if I,

2529
02:27:57,390 --> 02:28:01,040
if it, if I'm being, I'm like God, if I'm
Beta, I'd rather fight Jon Jones then rub.

2530
02:28:01,041 --> 02:28:02,350
I can't think of a worst matchup for him.

2531
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:06,040
There's some interesting fights
at two oh five real interesting.

2532
02:28:06,310 --> 02:28:09,460
Real interesting. I was really surprised
how well he shot were shot down.

2533
02:28:09,490 --> 02:28:13,840
I was really surprised. I was like,
wow, Bader has really turned a corner.

2534
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:16,540
He's really a fight to say that.

2535
02:28:17,140 --> 02:28:22,040
Well it's just because your shot had
two years layoff, but Beta look real

2536
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,850
good. I'm only basing it on how good
bait or looked. He looked real good.

2537
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:28,790
He looked real smoothly to stand up.
He's getting way better.

2538
02:28:28,820 --> 02:28:30,140
His Jab is nasty man.

2539
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:34,280
The was really getting up a lot of the
other aspects of a striking because he's

2540
02:28:34,281 --> 02:28:39,110
developed a rhythm with his jab where his
jab become so fluid and efficient that

2541
02:28:39,111 --> 02:28:43,100
he can like kind of half out there.
He can half it and then pop you with it.

2542
02:28:43,250 --> 02:28:47,750
He's landing it in like a more
diverse way than he ever did before.

2543
02:28:47,870 --> 02:28:51,500
He has more proficiency, like his
proficiency with his jam. I agree.

2544
02:28:51,501 --> 02:28:56,300
He looks great. Wayne Co main event.
Wayne Barrett versus Dustin Jacoby.

2545
02:28:57,100 --> 02:29:01,500
Um, he paid her. Does look
great. I think it's tough to,

2546
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:05,840
it's tough. The base it off the Rashad
fight. I agree with you. I agree with you.

2547
02:29:05,841 --> 02:29:07,220
That was a real tough fight for Rashad.

2548
02:29:07,250 --> 02:29:10,400
I think Rashad rubbed on it better to
have a fight with someone who wasn't a

2549
02:29:10,401 --> 02:29:13,940
member. Yeah. But think about Bateman.
It think what Betas come from marijuana.

2550
02:29:13,941 --> 02:29:17,360
He lost a fucking Tito Ortiz and
it's two in a row. Very lost.

2551
02:29:17,361 --> 02:29:21,680
A Tito Ortiz Maritio teasers
like hit him and he's like,

2552
02:29:22,110 --> 02:29:24,210
he hit him and then he chokes
them. Edit them. Yeah. Yeah.

2553
02:29:24,230 --> 02:29:27,410
But that motherfucker man,
because Ortiz,

2554
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:32,300
if he's on and he catches you,
he's still Tito Ortiz, Tito Ortiz.

2555
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:35,750
Gotta remember he was
at one point in time,

2556
02:29:35,751 --> 02:29:37,980
the motherfucker that is
put down in there until,

2557
02:29:38,310 --> 02:29:40,820
I mean not really because
chuck was always out there.

2558
02:29:40,890 --> 02:29:44,090
We always knew that chuck was out there,
but for before he fought chuck,

2559
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:45,350
when you think of what he did,

2560
02:29:45,351 --> 02:29:48,830
Evan Tanner and you think of like the
beat downs he put on Kevin and Ken

2561
02:29:48,831 --> 02:29:52,410
shamrock. Yeah man. Like
he's still cute. The wage.

2562
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:54,890
He was like one of the first guys
never use a one arm guillotine.

2563
02:29:55,490 --> 02:30:00,140
He a choked out. Yuki Kondo in Japan.
Remember that? Well, think about, um,

2564
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:01,940
such a pan. I think it was, well,

2565
02:30:01,941 --> 02:30:05,300
think about bait or though that he was
too lots of the road and just lost to

2566
02:30:05,301 --> 02:30:08,090
Tito Ortiz. He was like on the chopping
block, man. I remember just being like,

2567
02:30:08,091 --> 02:30:11,210
damn, really Beta. Well
that dude, just boom.

2568
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:14,930
Dustin Jacoby is going after Wayne
Barrett is a dangerous fight for Jacoby

2569
02:30:14,931 --> 02:30:17,390
because Barrett has fought
more elite competition.

2570
02:30:17,391 --> 02:30:21,020
Like he's fought Joe Schilling
beat Joe Schilling once.

2571
02:30:21,170 --> 02:30:25,140
Lost Joe Schilling in the last fight.
Not Joe Schilling down like he's,

2572
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:28,380
he's dangerous.
And Jacoby is a,

2573
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:31,940
I forget the Brazilian cat that
he got knocked out by dude.

2574
02:30:31,941 --> 02:30:35,780
I say mcnichols arena. That arena has
been shut down for literally 15 years.

2575
02:30:35,781 --> 02:30:36,920
That's Magnus Urena.

2576
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:42,260
Magnus mcnichols is old school where
you'll see like two and three happened to,

2577
02:30:42,261 --> 02:30:46,510
this is a good fight. Wayne
Barrett. He slick man.

2578
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:50,750
Look at that. Oops. Not here. Oh yeah.

2579
02:30:51,260 --> 02:30:53,030
Jacoby's like super aggressive too.

2580
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:58,060
I forget that dude that he fought this
bad ass Brazilian cat put was Dustin

2581
02:30:59,150 --> 02:31:02,390
Jacoby's record bad ass dude
who caught him with a left hook.

2582
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:05,870
Do it's tough cause Jacoby came to
the UFC and just struggled. Right?

2583
02:31:05,871 --> 02:31:09,700
Because you can't fight like
this well off, have to get
off like this. It's, it's,

2584
02:31:09,980 --> 02:31:13,940
it's a different style. Fighting with
the small gloves, that's for sure.

2585
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:19,040
How did he lose to,
that's MMA. MMA The wall.

2586
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:24,900
That's all MMA. See you fine. Um,
destined. Jacoby's a kickboxing career.

2587
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:29,080
Um,
we could duck under coe.

2588
02:31:29,100 --> 02:31:33,840
He slicky duck under the looping
right hand. Yeah. It's just,

2589
02:31:33,841 --> 02:31:38,580
um, the, the, the big gloves thing. The
defense is so much different. Oh, 100%.

2590
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:40,650
And that's what happened.
A shilling and shilling his last fight,

2591
02:31:40,651 --> 02:31:43,860
he got caught with that superman
punch by that dude. That was bad.

2592
02:31:43,970 --> 02:31:48,570
Who was ruthless shit happens. But
those punches, they come down on angles.

2593
02:31:49,050 --> 02:31:52,740
There is
Dan.

2594
02:31:52,741 --> 02:31:55,870
That stretch from 13 to 15 was tough.

2595
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:58,050
Why can't I read that script?

2596
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:02,700
Make that Casey Green
Burials Perera Alex Berrera.

2597
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:08,020
Yeah, it was pretty last diaper. Yeah,
that's who it was. It was Pereira. Um,

2598
02:32:08,140 --> 02:32:10,790
demis fought all over. Yeah, you got a d.

2599
02:32:10,830 --> 02:32:14,490
It's a totally different style of
defense when you using the small gloves,

2600
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:19,200
the big loves give you so much more
leeway to catching punches and the punches

2601
02:32:19,201 --> 02:32:22,680
themselves are bigger. That gloves are
bigger so the punches are coming at you.

2602
02:32:22,681 --> 02:32:26,940
It's a larger object coming at you and
you have a larger object to catch that

2603
02:32:26,941 --> 02:32:31,230
larger object and all that shit is shrunk
and considerably when you put those

2604
02:32:31,231 --> 02:32:32,880
MMA gloves to the Max Day,

2605
02:32:32,881 --> 02:32:34,800
it'd be like these guys fighting
with their hand wraps on.

2606
02:32:35,170 --> 02:32:39,600
It's completely different game. What do
you think about the idea of no gloves?

2607
02:32:40,430 --> 02:32:45,120
I won't work. No. Oh, I'm, if you
hate money and ratings, it'll work.

2608
02:32:46,710 --> 02:32:49,350
You know what I'm saying?
Like, like it's rough.

2609
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:51,680
It's rough enough now being mainstream,
you know,

2610
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:53,160
I don't think we're still mainstream.

2611
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:55,920
I think we're still working
on that with the top sports.

2612
02:32:56,160 --> 02:33:00,080
You take gloves off and these dudes are
bare knuckle fucking dudes up. Yeah,

2613
02:33:00,081 --> 02:33:03,600
it makes sense to us. Right. It
makes sense that the educated people,

2614
02:33:03,601 --> 02:33:06,930
but I mean made America sees that shit.

2615
02:33:06,930 --> 02:33:10,770
General People like what the
hell? This is so barbaric. Right.

2616
02:33:11,920 --> 02:33:16,680
That's the only thing. Yeah,
maybe. I don't know man. I mean,

2617
02:33:16,770 --> 02:33:20,610
why is it barbaric to punch in the face
and not barbaric to knee in the face.

2618
02:33:20,820 --> 02:33:25,800
I'll come show I'm with you 100% take
the gloves off. It's safer. It is. It is.

2619
02:33:25,801 --> 02:33:29,850
I'm with you. However, marketing
wise, good luck selling
that. They're like, hold up.

2620
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:33,300
We're going back to the Kimbo slice
backyard brawl days thought we were moving

2621
02:33:33,301 --> 02:33:36,060
forward. Well you would have a lot
of dudes breaking their hands too.

2622
02:33:36,150 --> 02:33:37,170
That'd be a real problem.

2623
02:33:37,230 --> 02:33:40,500
It'd be a real problem for like longevity
of your career and people think I'm

2624
02:33:40,501 --> 02:33:44,910
exaggerating. Listen, take away the
hand wraps. Take away the wrist wraps.

2625
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:45,800
No risk wraps.

2626
02:33:45,801 --> 02:33:50,801
Cause I think one of the flaws of the
human hand and wait for punching is the

2627
02:33:51,031 --> 02:33:52,470
wrist.
It's hard.

2628
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:56,010
Like you have to have Rick real
discipline to punch hard and you have to

2629
02:33:56,011 --> 02:34:00,150
practice hitting things bare knuckle
to really develop that rigidity in your

2630
02:34:00,151 --> 02:34:02,370
wrist when you deliver the,
the impact of a punch.

2631
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:06,090
Because most people when they hit things,
their wristbands back twist sideways.

2632
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:08,310
Most people don't know.
They wind up breaking their hands.

2633
02:34:08,311 --> 02:34:10,560
They hit with the
knuckles and the outside.

2634
02:34:10,860 --> 02:34:14,580
Well that's why boss would open hand
slap pitches. Well the is doing that now.

2635
02:34:14,581 --> 02:34:16,980
He was, he was fighting Pancrase so
it's the only way you could fight.

2636
02:34:17,350 --> 02:34:19,680
He figured out that was the
rules of Pancrase. Yeah.

2637
02:34:19,690 --> 02:34:22,000
Also did it though when they had gloves,
he used open hand.

2638
02:34:22,001 --> 02:34:25,460
Shit ruined when they had
gloves. He did that. Yeah. He,

2639
02:34:25,630 --> 02:34:30,430
he would throw throws hooks with an open
hand. He said. Interesting. Yeah. Huh.

2640
02:34:30,490 --> 02:34:34,030
Well, that's one of the reasons
why probably transferred
so easily to pancreas.

2641
02:34:34,540 --> 02:34:35,950
Damn. It was a good fight. You know,

2642
02:34:35,951 --> 02:34:38,500
one of the things that boss figured
out how to do in some weird way,

2643
02:34:38,501 --> 02:34:42,970
he figured out how to pull his hand back
way far. So when he was hitting guys,

2644
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:47,680
he was hitting him like a punch with the
palm. Yeah, with the base of the palm,

2645
02:34:47,681 --> 02:34:52,400
like right where it reaches a
like where the, the palm is, um,

2646
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:56,890
meets the wrist joint. He would pose
hands so far back, like unnaturally far,

2647
02:34:57,400 --> 02:34:58,600
if you watch his fights,

2648
02:34:58,601 --> 02:35:02,190
it's kind of weird how far his hand was
like the first freak athlete to get the,

2649
02:35:02,270 --> 02:35:05,770
I mean, he was a freak athlete man
who's the first elite striker in MMA,

2650
02:35:06,220 --> 02:35:08,080
in my opinion,
him and most Smith.

2651
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:11,740
But he was probably the
first cars with moe.

2652
02:35:11,741 --> 02:35:16,440
He really didn't know any grappling to
speak of when we first started fighting

2653
02:35:16,441 --> 02:35:17,830
and Pancrase he,
you know,

2654
02:35:17,831 --> 02:35:21,640
he really had to learn more grappling
before we could see like an extreme

2655
02:35:21,641 --> 02:35:23,350
fighting.
You've got to see what his kickbox.

2656
02:35:23,351 --> 02:35:25,870
It was really like when you
act out Culann Soviet era,

2657
02:35:26,390 --> 02:35:30,220
that's when everybody was like, Oh
shit, like this is some next level shit.

2658
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:33,790
And then when he came over to the UFC
and beat Mark Coleman and won the title,

2659
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:37,660
people are like, oh, okay, this
is what a kickbox are really low.

2660
02:35:37,661 --> 02:35:42,310
It's like a world class. Kickboxer
boss said he taught himself Jujitsu.

2661
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:44,560
That's madness. Crazy. Right?

2662
02:35:44,770 --> 02:35:47,370
Then you'd watch videos and teach
himself had a training partner,

2663
02:35:47,410 --> 02:35:50,350
just humans trading partner with
learning. Hey, I tried this on you.

2664
02:35:50,380 --> 02:35:53,770
How crazy is that? I believe
it. Awesome bosses. Crazy bitch.

2665
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:58,390
Savage hit some crazy ideas
about conditioning too. He goes,

2666
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:03,190
when are we kicked the bag? I would go
100% and how long can I do? 30 30 seconds.

2667
02:36:03,191 --> 02:36:08,191
100% well tomorrow I'll do 40 seconds
and then I do two minutes and then Tracy

2668
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:11,650
do to build it up so that he could
get to like whatever the round was.

2669
02:36:11,650 --> 02:36:16,450
It was just sprint God
the different time back then.

2670
02:36:17,230 --> 02:36:20,950
Well they didn't, you
know. Now people do Tabata.

2671
02:36:21,790 --> 02:36:26,790
When you do a elliptical and you do
like a intervals like Tabata intervals,

2672
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:29,860
we do what is the,
is like 20 seconds,

2673
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:34,120
10 seconds off the typical Tabata.

2674
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:36,070
What I do when I do a sprint,

2675
02:36:36,071 --> 02:36:39,790
like if I'm in a hotel and I have a
nothing but elliptical machine at the gym,

2676
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:44,310
I'll do sprints on the elliptical machine
while crank it up. So like whatever,

2677
02:36:44,470 --> 02:36:47,920
really high level and I'll do 30
minutes of thunder, I call it,

2678
02:36:48,380 --> 02:36:52,080
or 30 seconds of thunder. I was like 30
minutes now god Damn, 30 seconds. Well,

2679
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:57,100
30 minutes for the whole workout,
but for the thunder it's 30 seconds on,

2680
02:36:57,101 --> 02:36:58,150
30 seconds off.
That's,

2681
02:36:58,151 --> 02:37:03,060
it gives me something to do and
like those 30 seconds off like, oh,

2682
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:05,890
I know it's common. I know it's common.
Here comes up fucking 20 minutes.

2683
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:10,250
I think it's a part of the way to do
it because you're not so focused on the

2684
02:37:10,251 --> 02:37:10,781
overall time.

2685
02:37:10,781 --> 02:37:15,781
Me and my folks on 30 30 30 30 30 it
also gets you used to being completely

2686
02:37:15,861 --> 02:37:20,500
exerted. It's a great way to, to
get a cardio workout. Um, piece.

2687
02:37:20,550 --> 02:37:23,570
I'm like, what people think
of like a hardcore workouts.

2688
02:37:23,571 --> 02:37:26,990
You think of an air dine or maybe a,
a versa climber.

2689
02:37:27,160 --> 02:37:30,170
Like those you think of is
like Hark averse climber.

2690
02:37:30,470 --> 02:37:34,130
You can get the same kind of insane
workout on an elliptical machine,

2691
02:37:34,170 --> 02:37:37,100
hundred percent, but people associate
elliptical with like, you know,

2692
02:37:37,101 --> 02:37:40,490
you're watching the news going slow.

2693
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,170
When I use the elliptical machine,

2694
02:37:42,171 --> 02:37:43,810
people look at me like something
fucking wrong with you.

2695
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:47,910
I go hard in the paint on and I go
fucking hard on the elliptical. Now,

2696
02:37:47,950 --> 02:37:52,440
hard in the paint, in the paint. What does
that mean? Just like this mask authors.

2697
02:37:52,450 --> 02:37:53,283
I like

2698
02:37:54,470 --> 02:37:59,470
the pill hard in the motherfucking
paint us round two or three rounds.

2699
02:38:00,411 --> 02:38:04,620
Three damn. Dustin Jacoby. Uh, you don't,

2700
02:38:04,621 --> 02:38:09,500
you don't how we're starting to see a
trend where guys are sparring less and

2701
02:38:09,501 --> 02:38:12,270
less because they realize the
abuse and the gym that, uh,

2702
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:16,220
Rodriguez was saying how he only sparked
three times I think in camp. Yeah. Yeah.

2703
02:38:16,221 --> 02:38:19,650
Year. Um, I think Brian, Stan
was saying that. Yeah. Well.

2704
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:21,050
We'll just see Jacoby trying to,

2705
02:38:21,051 --> 02:38:24,260
we'll get Dustin Jacoby really
taking it to a man. He looks great.

2706
02:38:24,950 --> 02:38:27,470
He looks really improved
too from the Pereira fight.

2707
02:38:28,460 --> 02:38:31,940
I think a that knockout really,
uh, taught him a lot about defense.

2708
02:38:32,450 --> 02:38:35,000
He's looking great in this fight,
man. Good leg kick right there.

2709
02:38:35,610 --> 02:38:39,770
Barrett's thrown with the but look how
like how easy it is to block punches with

2710
02:38:39,771 --> 02:38:43,760
these God damned gloves. It's such
a different game. It's so different.

2711
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:48,430
Look at this John Wayne par when he
does that cage. [inaudible] Todd,

2712
02:38:48,431 --> 02:38:51,680
did they wear MMA gloves or
do they wear gloves? Yeah,

2713
02:38:52,190 --> 02:38:54,290
he has a fight coming up Friday.
He's coming out here soon.

2714
02:38:54,291 --> 02:38:57,210
He's fighting black dynamite.
I liked them in um,

2715
02:38:57,350 --> 02:39:02,000
in cage Moitai and he's out here fighting
for the title San Diego in a, yeah,

2716
02:39:02,350 --> 02:39:05,780
in lion fight. He's going to fight
for the title. I liked that guy too.

2717
02:39:05,781 --> 02:39:09,200
He's a good dude. Yeah. Really good dude.
Funny. Yeah. I got to work out with him,

2718
02:39:09,201 --> 02:39:09,680
man.

2719
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:14,330
He showed me some his and was that really
interesting way of throwing punches?

2720
02:39:14,660 --> 02:39:19,460
Like he throws everything hard. Like, even
his jab is hard. He makes it count. Jab.

2721
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:24,380
He pulls back with his right
hand. Oh Shit. Wayne Barrett
went down. What happened?

2722
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:27,980
Oh my God. So it's uh, he's,

2723
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:32,480
he was touching the back of his head like
it was a bad strike and he's out of it.

2724
02:39:33,290 --> 02:39:37,700
Oh, he's super out of it. That's
it. Whoa. Dustin Jacoby knocked out.

2725
02:39:37,701 --> 02:39:41,300
Wayne Barrett and Wayne Barrett is a,
he was pointing to the back of his head.

2726
02:39:41,301 --> 02:39:44,960
He pointed to the back of his head earlier
in the fight too. Damn. Justin Jacoby.

2727
02:39:44,961 --> 02:39:49,370
Congratulations. Good for you.
Um, what was I just saying?

2728
02:39:49,940 --> 02:39:54,500
A fucking John Van. John Wayne par.

2729
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:58,430
He throws punches like this.
He pulls back on his right hand.

2730
02:39:58,730 --> 02:40:02,610
This is how he throws a jab.
He goes like that. She said,

2731
02:40:03,890 --> 02:40:08,360
I've worked out with them for like an
hour and a half. We did awesome. Yeah,

2732
02:40:08,361 --> 02:40:09,740
it was really fun.
He's a good dude.

2733
02:40:09,741 --> 02:40:12,260
He's showed me a lot of cool
shit to a lot of cool shit.

2734
02:40:12,261 --> 02:40:15,720
Like the way he delivers is interesting
too. Damn. That is legit as fuck.

2735
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:19,320
What does he point in the back of his
head for the, you could see that again,

2736
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:20,250
that'd be one where you got hit.

2737
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:22,710
He was getting battered
before he got dropped there.

2738
02:40:23,010 --> 02:40:27,810
I mean that was not just that one
shot either. What happened? Oh,

2739
02:40:27,811 --> 02:40:31,350
they went to a commercial, so I
wanted to see that knocked down again.

2740
02:40:31,430 --> 02:40:33,690
That's another thing. I
don't Miss Boxing. No.

2741
02:40:33,691 --> 02:40:37,020
Any box and I'll watch fucking
all of, we have a a thing, right?

2742
02:40:37,021 --> 02:40:40,530
Can we rewind that for a second? I just
want to see that knocked down again.

2743
02:40:40,531 --> 02:40:45,270
It'd be nice.
I forgot we have the DVR up in this bitch.

2744
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:50,760
Yeah, there it is. Not right before
that, Jamie. Right before that. Oh,

2745
02:40:50,761 --> 02:40:54,930
right before there we go. This is
the money and here we go. Boom.

2746
02:40:55,290 --> 02:40:59,580
On the temple. But when that's good
chin back as a hundred percent good.

2747
02:40:59,670 --> 02:41:01,710
That's the side of the head.
Oh, that'd be the temple.

2748
02:41:02,060 --> 02:41:04,100
Let's say that's the back of the head.
Let me see that again.

2749
02:41:04,101 --> 02:41:06,810
You come from the home
and left. Took Bam. No,

2750
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:11,310
no chance to make it slow.
Jamie and legal. Whoa. Hold on.

2751
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:14,370
Hold on, but make it go slow. That's
a fucking temple dude. Watch it.

2752
02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:18,420
That would be bad. Hold on. Make
it slow. Isn't there a slow button?

2753
02:41:18,421 --> 02:41:19,380
There's a slow mo thing.

2754
02:41:20,340 --> 02:41:24,180
You press like a pause and then I dunno.
Double Pie.

2755
02:41:24,190 --> 02:41:26,730
I think pause and then a fast forward.

2756
02:41:27,780 --> 02:41:28,613
Yeah.

2757
02:41:28,890 --> 02:41:33,520
Oh, let me see that thing. Isn't there
like a small way you can do it slow Mo.

2758
02:41:33,880 --> 02:41:37,630
Pretty sure the rest. What does this
no network connection cancel. Hold on.

2759
02:41:38,050 --> 02:41:40,990
Oh he say it's back to what happened
here Jamie. Where am precedents to,

2760
02:41:41,320 --> 02:41:45,280
where's the receiver? It's in
there. Well how does it work?

2761
02:41:46,600 --> 02:41:50,770
Well it's not, it's not reacting.
Think got to hit cancel on that thing

2762
02:41:53,430 --> 02:41:56,440
for sure. Back in the head. But it's
legal. You know what I'm saying?

2763
02:41:56,441 --> 02:41:58,750
It's in transition. Okay, so it's legal.

2764
02:42:01,370 --> 02:42:02,090
Okay.

2765
02:42:02,090 --> 02:42:04,700
Um, take a look at it
better. That first view,

2766
02:42:05,660 --> 02:42:08,060
lets get a view of it in real time first.

2767
02:42:09,860 --> 02:42:14,420
Here it is right here. This is where
you can see it. Back to that. Boom. Bam.

2768
02:42:14,490 --> 02:42:17,810
See to me it looks like the side of the
head. Definitely. He's grabbing this.

2769
02:42:17,811 --> 02:42:19,610
He's grabbing pesticide the head and no,

2770
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:22,160
that's not where he's grabbing
and he's grabbing like his temple.

2771
02:42:22,910 --> 02:42:25,940
How do I make this thing go slow?
Let me see if I can do this.

2772
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:28,290
I think there's a way.

2773
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:34,990
Yeah, here it is. Oh,
here we go. Okay. Okay.

2774
02:42:34,991 --> 02:42:38,190
I get the old crazy eyes on
him. Okay. Ready? Here we go.

2775
02:42:41,490 --> 02:42:44,910
It was Dustin Jacoby. Moving in. Check it.

2776
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:46,680
Okay.

2777
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:50,660
Mad pressure budget. Coby to
good defense. Good defense here.

2778
02:42:50,930 --> 02:42:55,370
Bear tried to swing that right hook around
left to Colby. Bank catches him here.

2779
02:42:55,430 --> 02:42:59,750
100% clean. That side of the head side of
the head, which is legit, right? Correct.

2780
02:43:00,260 --> 02:43:01,160
Okay.
Let's see.

2781
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:06,290
We get a good view of it here and it
really relying on that right hand. Boom,

2782
02:43:06,530 --> 02:43:10,100
kind of Cassie if grazes that,
but that ones gets blocked.

2783
02:43:10,460 --> 02:43:12,910
That wouldn't gets blocked.
So now he's coming over again.

2784
02:43:12,911 --> 02:43:17,370
Bear it is or a Jacoby has misses
that left and now here we go.

2785
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:20,160
It goes to the back of the head

2786
02:43:23,770 --> 02:43:26,730
to look at that.
Come on son.

2787
02:43:28,130 --> 02:43:29,050
Look where he's standing.

2788
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:32,620
That's basically the back of look
where he's standing there standing,

2789
02:43:32,621 --> 02:43:36,690
staring at each other.
Homeboy moves though he moves his bear,

2790
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:40,960
turns his head sideways and he
hits them right in the temple bra.

2791
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:43,600
That's not in the template right here.
If we look at him,

2792
02:43:43,690 --> 02:43:45,280
it's not the bat not touching right there.

2793
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:47,890
He's not touch as he
has a hook for an arm.

2794
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:52,900
There's no fucking way that's hitting
the bag. No, look at it right there.

2795
02:43:52,901 --> 02:43:56,650
It's bouncing off the side of his head
and you see the fist appear behind his

2796
02:43:56,651 --> 02:44:01,270
head. One more time. One more time. Let's
watch it again. Watch it again. Boom.

2797
02:44:01,271 --> 02:44:04,270
That's one.
And there's the right hook misses,

2798
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:09,550
and there's the left hook over the top
and here cubs. Here it comes. Look,

2799
02:44:09,551 --> 02:44:14,290
they're standing right at each other
and the punch comes, eh. Watch.

2800
02:44:14,291 --> 02:44:17,260
When the companies look at that,

2801
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:22,600
that's not touching them and correct.
Incorrect. This is a straight punch,

2802
02:44:22,630 --> 02:44:23,200
right?

2803
02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:27,400
It lands on the side of his head and then
a glances off the side of his head and

2804
02:44:27,401 --> 02:44:31,180
you see the fist behind the head,
you'll fit is not no fucking chance.

2805
02:44:32,650 --> 02:44:35,560
There's not hitting the back of his head
that is hitting the side of his head

2806
02:44:35,800 --> 02:44:40,720
and you're seeing the punching glove.
It's like, here Joe look like, yeah, yeah,

2807
02:44:40,721 --> 02:44:44,150
that's legal dude. I'm not, it's illegal.
But I think, I think that's legal.

2808
02:44:44,230 --> 02:44:46,510
The same back of the head.
That's the side of the head will will.

2809
02:44:46,810 --> 02:44:47,800
It's the side of the head.

2810
02:44:47,830 --> 02:44:51,940
You got to punch me and I move like this
and you end up hitting side and back of

2811
02:44:51,941 --> 02:44:54,160
the head that's,
he's not hitting the back of the head.

2812
02:44:54,220 --> 02:44:58,780
So he didn't touch the back of his head
of his head. No. Touch side and back.

2813
02:44:58,840 --> 02:44:59,860
I don't know,
man.

2814
02:45:00,310 --> 02:45:04,750
Boom to me looks like
right behind the ear,

2815
02:45:04,751 --> 02:45:08,230
which is totally legit. The back of
the head to me is a rabbit ponch.

2816
02:45:08,231 --> 02:45:11,310
That's where the base of his neck
neat meets the face. The head.

2817
02:45:12,550 --> 02:45:15,910
That's the back of the year. That's
legal. That's not, that's does. No,

2818
02:45:18,400 --> 02:45:22,510
I think you're changing the game. No, no,
no. That's fine, bro. It's changing again.

2819
02:45:23,230 --> 02:45:26,830
Yeah, but it's not booming. It's
legal. That's kind of legal. Yeah,

2820
02:45:26,831 --> 02:45:31,240
it's totally legal. Yeah, I
agree. Or maybe I misunderstood.
Maybe I misunderstood.

2821
02:45:31,270 --> 02:45:34,030
I thought you were saying
communication here. That's all it is.

2822
02:45:34,450 --> 02:45:38,320
That's pretty slick though. It's a big
win for Jacoby, Matt. Real big win.

2823
02:45:39,190 --> 02:45:42,460
Oh Shit. Artem leavened top of
the heap. He's out though. Huh?

2824
02:45:42,610 --> 02:45:44,950
Well he's out for this fight.
You know, you look at that guy,

2825
02:45:44,951 --> 02:45:47,980
you look at his body and you're like,
it looks a lot like Ari Shaffir his body.

2826
02:45:49,270 --> 02:45:53,780
How's that guy? Such a bad ass,
you know man. If number four, Huh?

2827
02:45:54,250 --> 02:45:57,810
Well he's been fucked up
by Joe showing any sense.

2828
02:45:58,200 --> 02:46:01,430
How is he so highly ranked?
Well, Joe's too though. Awesome.

2829
02:46:01,930 --> 02:46:06,730
Well Joe Schilling hasn't really a lost
in glory other than the decision loss to

2830
02:46:06,731 --> 02:46:09,500
a Simon Marcus or did
that wasn't in glory.

2831
02:46:09,530 --> 02:46:14,150
The decision last to Artem leaven
a beat Artem 11 by decision too.

2832
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:18,440
And then the decision
loss to Wayne Barrett.

2833
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:20,270
Those are the fights
that he lost in glory.

2834
02:46:20,290 --> 02:46:24,930
So shilling getting paid bank to compete
in MMA for sure. Stick with kickbox.

2835
02:46:24,950 --> 02:46:26,570
I agree.
What the fuck are you doing?

2836
02:46:26,571 --> 02:46:29,690
I think he just doesn't want to back off
from a challenge and he wants to be the

2837
02:46:29,691 --> 02:46:32,810
best at everything he does. And that's
how he got to be such a bad ass.

2838
02:46:32,811 --> 02:46:37,190
Kickbox I agree, but be a bad ass.
Kickboxer it'll be an average MMA fighter.

2839
02:46:37,220 --> 02:46:40,310
Well it's just really hard to do
everything, man. It's really hard.

2840
02:46:40,490 --> 02:46:45,470
It's really fun to not do everything. It's
not possible. It's really not. It's a,

2841
02:46:46,130 --> 02:46:47,450
it's a crazy game man.

2842
02:46:47,451 --> 02:46:52,451
The game of trying to be the baddest
motherfucker and two disciplines.

2843
02:46:53,331 --> 02:46:56,240
That is a crazy,
crazy game cause they got,

2844
02:46:56,270 --> 02:47:00,410
the guys he's fighting aren't focusing on
their off time grappling and wrestling.

2845
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:03,620
They're getting better at striking
100% that's what it's tough.

2846
02:47:03,621 --> 02:47:05,610
Like when I see that I
love, I love Joe, she'll,

2847
02:47:05,611 --> 02:47:08,030
and I see a friend of yours is
front of mind and I support him,

2848
02:47:08,390 --> 02:47:10,250
but when I see him do I have a man,
I'm like, what the fuck you doing?

2849
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:12,980
Well you know what?
He knocked out Melvin Manhoef in MMA,

2850
02:47:12,981 --> 02:47:15,470
but he was fighting a guy,
Melvin Manhoef,

2851
02:47:15,490 --> 02:47:18,830
that even though we had a lot of
success in MMA, knocked out Mark Hunt,

2852
02:47:19,340 --> 02:47:21,980
he's a guy who's been knocked
out a gang at times. Hahnemann,

2853
02:47:22,010 --> 02:47:25,790
knocked out by Robbie Lawler and one of
the most horrific knockouts you've ever

2854
02:47:25,791 --> 02:47:27,770
seen your life. It was winning
that fight too. It was,

2855
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:31,350
if you remember Robbie
Lawler uncorked a nuke from

2856
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:38,810
and his lights went out and he
goes flat to his back so bad.

2857
02:47:38,870 --> 02:47:42,120
And Robbie comes down on
him when he's out and oh,

2858
02:47:42,160 --> 02:47:46,140
bismuth blood all over his mouth,
his blood coming out of his mouth,

2859
02:47:46,141 --> 02:47:50,690
and he busted his fucking
limp open. I think that, uh,

2860
02:47:50,780 --> 02:47:52,490
you know,
Joseph's just got that in him.

2861
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:54,770
He just wants to be a bad
motherfucker at everything he does,

2862
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:58,910
which is why I became so good at
kickboxing. But I think there's,

2863
02:47:58,930 --> 02:48:00,500
there's wisdom in your words.

2864
02:48:00,890 --> 02:48:04,220
He's one of the best kick boxers on the
planet earth without a doubt. Hands Down,

2865
02:48:04,490 --> 02:48:08,570
hands down, one of the best on planet
earth. But I think capsule, MMA fighter,

2866
02:48:08,690 --> 02:48:11,060
but losing the way he
lost that Japanese cat,

2867
02:48:11,090 --> 02:48:13,340
that half Japanese dude that he lost to,
who was that guy's name?

2868
02:48:14,650 --> 02:48:18,050
Where you got Superman Punch?
Yeah. That guy is a beast, man.

2869
02:48:18,051 --> 02:48:21,270
That guy's really good. He's no
joke. He's good though. The his,

2870
02:48:21,290 --> 02:48:25,590
his striking is nasty. That fucking
punch was nasty. No matter how you slice.

2871
02:48:25,591 --> 02:48:30,380
Super Nasty. I Isd, I'm just saying
it's still Bella tour. It is.

2872
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:33,110
But that guy was the only fought
bell toward that one time. I mean,

2873
02:48:33,111 --> 02:48:37,770
that guy could have easily been in
the UFC and get good at Dow. Fuck. Ah.

2874
02:48:38,150 --> 02:48:42,600
Kobiashi dude. Never know. Yeah.

2875
02:48:44,190 --> 02:48:47,420
Yeah.
So I kind of get his ass up and uh,

2876
02:48:47,850 --> 02:48:50,990
we got 10 minutes left before
we go to three hours. So, um,

2877
02:48:51,020 --> 02:48:52,670
we're gonna take a
little break here folks,

2878
02:48:52,671 --> 02:48:57,420
and we're going to have a very short part
to the sh the part two will be so God

2879
02:48:57,421 --> 02:49:01,000
damn short, it's 10. What
is it? Nine 15 now actually,

2880
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:05,630
we'll probably go to 10 o'clock. We'll
make part two like, um, 45 minutes.

2881
02:49:05,780 --> 02:49:09,270
We'll go to 10 o'clock. So, uh, we're
going to get the fuck outta here. Now,

2882
02:49:09,330 --> 02:49:13,530
the end of this podcast has come.
If you're a annoyed by this, listen,

2883
02:49:13,531 --> 02:49:16,830
this is just how these things
go. Whatever for sure. Don't,

2884
02:49:16,980 --> 02:49:21,560
don't download part too, because for sure
we just going to be talking about, uh,

2885
02:49:21,580 --> 02:49:25,410
our friend Joe Schilling. Well, I love
that dude. So, uh, that's why we're here.

2886
02:49:25,411 --> 02:49:29,460
That's why this is the first Spike
TV glory event we've ever done.

2887
02:49:29,461 --> 02:49:32,130
A fight companion,
400% for Joe Schilling.

2888
02:49:32,730 --> 02:49:37,620
This is what this is for moral
Renelle. Okay. Shied with skeletor.

2889
02:49:37,740 --> 02:49:39,600
We'll be right back,
right back.
