1
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,850
A lot of it was just,
you know,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,710
the transcendental experience I had
reading,

3
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:19,590
you know,
I remember reading the Lord of the rings

4
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:22,650
in about eighth grade and just finding
that

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,490
inexperience,
just that,

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,870
just the level of engagement and
intensity in that experience that,

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,820
um,
you know,

8
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,910
the rest of my life didn't really match,
match up to that.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,440
Um,
but I was also had that impulse to,

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,560
if I liked something or was excited by
something,

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,270
I wanted to do it.
Um,

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,210
you know,
I never was that comfortable in the role

13
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:50,890
of fan and I knew a lot of people who
were,

14
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:51,724
you know,
like,

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,940
um,
there are people I knew who just were

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,180
fanatical baseball fans and really
enrich their lives to kind of go to a

17
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:02,700
lot of games,
no more about statistics and everybody

18
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,750
else.
Whereas if I,

19
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,010
you know,
if I like baseball,

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,600
I wanted to play baseball and certainly
that happened to me with a rock and roll

21
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,300
when I was about 12,
13.

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,380
Um,
you know,

23
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,940
I started listening to a led Zeppelin,
aerosmith,

24
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:18,600
and,
uh,

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,610
David Bowie.
And you know,

26
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:23,420
really to me that was a central center
of my high school experience was,

27
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,140
was just music and trying to make music,
which was something that I had very

28
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,410
little talent for.
So I knew a lot of talented musicians.

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,630
I could play a little bit,
but,

30
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,170
but not well.
Um,

31
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,640
at the same time I was reading really
intensely and starting to think about

32
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,220
writing.
And when I picked up a pen and tried to

33
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,440
write a story,
I had the feeling that was completely

34
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:47,040
different from the feeling I had holding
a guitar and feeling like,

35
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,320
you know,
this is not my native language.

36
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,670
You know,
I don't know how to do this.

37
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,980
If somebody showed me,
I could kind of,

38
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,500
yeah,
I can make my fingers do what they told

39
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:58,200
me to do,
but I couldn't intuitively feel the

40
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:58,970
music.

41
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,390
Uh,
but when I started to write stories,

42
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,201
I immediately felt like,
oh,

43
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,720
I know how to do this.
I know where you'd go now.

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,660
Um,
I knew when it started doing to stop,

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,120
um,
you know,

46
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,910
it,
it came relatively easily.

47
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,410
Um,
and I would say that that feeling of,

48
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:17,630
I know how to do this,
that,

49
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:20,310
that kind of was the first thing that I
really loved in life.

50
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:23,280
That I felt like I could do at the level
I wanted to do.

51
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,190
Um,
and I,

52
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,090
I did discover that in,
in high school.

53
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:30,270
So by the time I got to college,
I was very clear with everyone.

54
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:30,661
I knew they,
well,

55
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:31,550
what do you want to do?
I want,

56
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,840
I want to be a writer.
Um,

57
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,240
so I guess that is,
um,

58
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,710
relatively early,
but I'd be surprised if a lot of other

59
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:45,711
writers didn't say the same thing
I read as a kid.

60
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,360
And My mother certainly encouraged it,
but they weren't educated people,

61
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:51,610
they were working class people.
Um,

62
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,420
so,
you know,

63
00:02:55,421 --> 00:03:00,190
and I,
and I often meet a writers who have

64
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,270
similar stories.
You know,

65
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:03,880
I,
I remember in high school going to the

66
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,030
library and asking for the Magic
Mountain.

67
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,420
I had discovered Thomas Mann and,
and the librarian kept telling me that,

68
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:13,180
I must be mistaken,
but I didn't want to read the magic

69
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:17,380
mountain because you know,
nobody in this high school probably ever

70
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,960
had taken the magic out of the library.
But I said,

71
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:20,210
no,
no,

72
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,300
I've been reading Thomas Mann,
I read death in Venice.

73
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:22,901
I read,
you know,

74
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,190
Mario and the magician,
this,

75
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,620
the seven short novels.
I thought they were great and I want to

76
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,510
read the Magic Mountain and I,
um,

77
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,860
so it seems funny now,
but,

78
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:36,190
but I'd certainly didn't have a
particularly literary childhood.

79
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,230
Um,
what I had,

80
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,410
I had some very good English teachers in
is sort of,

81
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,780
you know,
perfectly average public high school in

82
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:47,590
New Jersey.

83
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,460
But once they knew that I liked to read,
they certainly had suggestions.

84
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,720
You know,
I had a,

85
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,870
um,
teacher probably in 11th grade who,

86
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:57,880
uh,
said all,

87
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:01,430
you got to read a Raymond Chandler and
you know,

88
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,000
I went on a binge of,
of a reading,

89
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,720
hard boiled detective fiction back then.
I still feel the

90
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,570
influence that that had on my writing.
You know,

91
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,210
I think I found Chandler,
so a stunningly good,

92
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:20,320
and I found that writing so,
so bold and funny and colorful.

93
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,690
Um,
I still think of that as a kind of ideal

94
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:24,460
for,
for a pro style and like,

95
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,200
you know,
so there's just a recommendation from a

96
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,130
high school teacher.
But,

97
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,380
um,
I was just the kind of kid who took it.

98
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:31,090
If my English teacher said,
read Moby Dick,

99
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,890
you know,
I'd go and read Moby Dick and if they

100
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:33,940
said,
read Raymond Chandler,

101
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,860
I Read Raymond Chandler because I was
just hungry.

102
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,030
It was the same,
same thing.

103
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,680
I think a lot,
there are a lot of kids do this with

104
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:39,221
music.
You know,

105
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:39,971
if your friend says,
Hey,

106
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,670
you got to listen to King Crimson,
or you know,

107
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,560
you've got to listen to radio head or
whatever,

108
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,690
they'll go out and listen to it.
But I was like that with,

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,130
with books and that to me is a,
that's the one sign I think when I meet

110
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:53,410
a young writer,
I feel like if they read really

111
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,800
passionately,
um,

112
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,120
that to me is the one mark of,
you know,

113
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,270
you'll be all right.
I'm,

114
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,710
I'm always mystified when I meet writers
who,

115
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,640
you know,
they want to write,

116
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,920
they have this urge to express
themselves,

117
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,590
but they don't want to read.
It just doesn't make sense.
