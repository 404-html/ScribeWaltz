1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,170
You know,
uh,

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:01,830
you know,
it's funny.

3
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,360
I'll tell you later.
Tell me now.

4
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,550
Three,
two,

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,010
one.
What's funny,

6
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,013
uh,
I was going to tell you a funny story 

7
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:13,040
about your address,
but it wouldn't be,

8
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,050
it wouldn't be funny for you.
We'll talk later about that.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,330
You and I,
we share African ancestry.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,703
Yeah,
yeah.

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,980
I was shocked.
Yeah.

12
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,430
I'm one point six percent.
Oh really?

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,510
See,
I have more,

14
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,343
uh,
I have more credentialed in math 

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,180
departments.
Your two percent,

16
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:30,660
right?
Yeah.

17
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,120
No,
and it's funny because,

18
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,860
you know,
you sort of have your,

19
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,903
the story in your family,
kind of like where he came from and 

20
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:40,740
everything mates.
And I always knew I was 25 percent,

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,660
you know,
Italian.

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,673
Uh,
and I knew that my family came from 

23
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,290
Sicily.
In fact,

24
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,000
uh,
the,

25
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,973
the,
the Rainelle is that came from Sicily 

26
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,440
all seemed to become kind of established
in the,

27
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,320
in the produce world.
Uh,

28
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,250
my dad was brought up in the south side 
of Chicago.

29
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,700
I'm 44 years old.
Okay.

30
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,534
So think about that for a minute.
My Dad was brought up in south side of 

31
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:09,200
Chicago and he was raised by his 
grandfather who was Sicilian,

32
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:13,680
had come from Sicily,
his grandfather delivered produce with a

33
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,270
horse and cart whoa in Chicago,
so

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,090
to have lived through that,
like to be brought up in a house where a

35
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:25,880
guy like leaves in the morning and a 
horse and cart to deliver,

36
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:26,714
produce an end to be alive,
like to fight in world war two to be 

37
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:35,510
through the atomic era,
the advent of the Internet.

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,333
Right.
But I always knew that we had Sicilians 

39
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:43,550
when I did the genetic test,
what some of those.

40
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,413
At some point in time,
one of those Sicilians must have shot 

41
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:51,910
southward and crossed the Mediterranean 
and lightheaded hookup down there.

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,820
Something.
Well,

43
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,100
that was the history of Sicily in the 
first place.

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,113
Yeah.
Cecily just being Sicilian in the first 

45
00:01:58,311 --> 00:01:59,144
place.
There was so many people that were a 

46
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,550
impregnated by the doors and by various 
people of West Africa and North Africa.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

48
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,280
I should've probably like,
always assumed,

49
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,720
but it just,
I hadn't thought about it.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,793
Um,
another thing I was reading about this 

51
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:15,674
stuff.
And you might know more about it than I 

52
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,440
do,
is that when you do those tests,

53
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:20,840
there's missing parts,
you know,

54
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,180
it does it like it captures what's 
there.

55
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:24,014
But there's could be a lot there that's 
not captured just in the way that 

56
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,160
chromosomes are inherited and passed 
down.

57
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,630
Like it's,
it's an incomplete picture.

58
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,610
Right.
There can be influences.

59
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,350
There could,
there could be in your.

60
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,400
It doesn't create a full picture of your
lineage.

61
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,263
There could be lineages that are there 
that aren't represented in your 

62
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:48,320
particular makeup.
How so?

63
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:51,170
Like what do you mean?
He know?

64
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,303
I hate to right off the bat,
get into south that I can't speak about 

65
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:58,430
any level of expertise.
I was just reading a piece and the piece

66
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:59,264
I was reading to do it was kind of a 
dissection of like what happened with 

67
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:06,661
Elizabeth Warren when she claimed we've 
been going off about that on the podcast

68
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:10,060
and I'm like 100 times more African than
she is native American.

69
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,710
Yeah.
Well that's what I found.

70
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:15,340
I'm 10 times more or whatever.
But there was a piece about.

71
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,283
It was,
it was a piece in the times explaining 

72
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,880
like how to make sense of now that 
everyone's doing these tasks,

73
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,110
like how to think about,
make sense,

74
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,050
these tests,
but,

75
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:24,963
but my understanding of it is that you 
could have a lot of ancestry that isn't 

76
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,793
captured in your genetic code and the 
way that would be detected through the 

77
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,254
testing.
Meaning there could be ancestors it for 

78
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:41,320
what?
[inaudible] you're inheriting half,

79
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,183
you know,
your Harrington chromosomes from each 

80
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:47,080
parent in somehow you could have.
It could be an incomplete picture.

81
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,600
You could have ancestors that had come 
from other,

82
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:50,141
you know,
whatever.

83
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,000
These,
these tests break out the world and do a

84
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:52,834
100 or some odd regions or zones that 
there could be people from those zones 

85
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:01,720
who were in your lineage that are not 
captured in your personal,

86
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,520
that are not captured in your genetic 
code.

87
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,503
That's so bizarre.
You would think it would all be in 

88
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:07,160
there.
So that's just a,

89
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:07,994
an incomplete measuring tool.
Is that what it is or is it just 

90
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,080
actually not in there?
I don't know.

91
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,710
I'm going to have to have a dude on.
Yeah,

92
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,860
I'll listen.
You need to understands it and as I say,

93
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,840
I feel like I'm off on a bad start here,
man.

94
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,140
I'm much a neanderthal.
Didn't say less than normal.

95
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,880
Really less than average.
The,

96
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,110
uh,
the number it said it gives you what you

97
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,881
did.
Twenty three and me,

98
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:28,360
right?
Yeah,

99
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,310
I can't remember.
I can't remember.

100
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,560
I just remember it was less than average
and you know,

101
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:35,830
and those things like our refined by how
many people do,

102
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:36,664
um,
you know,

103
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,650
but it was less than average,
which bummed me out,

104
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,670
but I'm like,
his hair is like a 13 year old Norwegian

105
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:43,450
girl,
you know what I mean?

106
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,550
So it's surprise,
shocking,

107
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,270
didn't surprise me too much.
Uh,

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,230
I was wishing to have a little more of 
that floating around in me.

109
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,020
It's a bizarre heritage,
you know,

110
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,854
the idea that there was a different type
of human that bread with Homo sapiens 

111
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,480
and that there's little bits and pieces 
of it floating around and people.

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,550
Yeah,
people discuss them.

113
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,150
People discuss,
I'll say an argument the other day where

114
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:07,984
they see a neanderthal or neanderthal 
and everyone grows up saying 

115
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:11,410
neanderthal.
It's one of those things you're supposed

116
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,480
to switch once you realize how you're 
supposed to do it,

117
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,860
right.
Neanderthal,

118
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,200
but I just can't get comfortable with 
it.

119
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,083
I go back and forth.
There's a lot of words that like that 

120
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,190
were.
I know you're supposed to do it,

121
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,024
but I can't get comfortable with it 
because I feel like it makes you sound 

122
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:24,664
pretentious.
It's like rolling your r's and certain 

123
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,950
Spanish words,
but we had this idea that the.

124
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,920
We had this idea,
the neanderthals as unsuccessful.

125
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,743
Right,
right.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,590
They are these brutish thugs that died 
out,

127
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,630
but they had a 600,000
year run in Europe alone.

128
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,763
600,000
years longer run than Homo sapiens have 

129
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,300
actually existed.
Yeah.

130
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,890
Yeah.
So whatever.

131
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,510
I don't know that we're going to hit 
like,

132
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,050
I don't know that we're going to match 
up and have that run.

133
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,980
Well,
we'll probably have a 23 and

134
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
me for whatever the fuck is after us.
They look somebody back then fuck the 

135
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,340
human.
Like,

136
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,213
oh,
one of those crazy warmonger Mexican 

137
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,590
rapists,
thieving humans died out.

138
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,110
It turns out they didn't totally die 
out.

139
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,360
Overrun with emotions and lies and 
someone,

140
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,310
someone of a superior race infiltrated 
the humans and banged one of them.

141
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,200
Yeah,
it's,

142
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,890
it's,
it's funny to look at that,

143
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,530
that understanding of those,
that understanding of those people.

144
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,950
I'm an end to have the site to picture 
in your mind's eye,

145
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:31,784
even though you can't picture it,
like what was look like when they were 

146
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:37,270
hooking up.
Someone are,

147
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,860
you know,
like anatomically,

148
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:45,130
behaviorally modern humans were hooking 
up with neanderthals was that was.

149
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,643
How is it perceived by their peers?
I bet the people that we think of as 

150
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:53,750
people back then,
like,

151
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,960
you know George,
the animal steele is no George.

152
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,930
The animal steel is a very famous 
progress or from back in the day,

153
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,273
and I thought you were gonna.
Say It was a paleontologist or 

154
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,130
anthropologists Rasler just arrest pro 
wrestler.

155
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,580
Very famous guy who could be a fucking 
cave man.

156
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,910
Like legitimately could be a cave man.
See if you,

157
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,380
uh,
you got a good image of him.

158
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,633
Now,
this is what I think when I think of 

159
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:21,710
people now give me a full body.
One day you go,

160
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,663
oh,
when I think of people he's hanging 

161
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,730
onto,
so homo sapiens,

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,120
Homo sapiens from,
you know,

163
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,200
200,000
years ago,

164
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,280
I think at George the animal steele.
I think there were something like that.

165
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,160
So the idea of George fucking a 
neanderthal chick,

166
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,900
not that far off.
I think our idea is that like Dan rather

167
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,510
would be out there banging some monkey 
lady.

168
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,930
I just don't think.
I don't think that's the case.

169
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,470
Like look at George's body.
Jesus fucking Christ.

170
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,070
He's got the hairiest shoulders I've 
ever seen in a man.

171
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,110
She's still alive.
I do not know.

172
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:59,960
I don't believe he is.
I hope he's not listening right now.

173
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,730
I don't believe he is a,
he's a legend.

174
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,130
Legend in the world with the pro 
wrestling.

175
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:05,930
So it's going to take more notes to hurt
his feelings.

176
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:08,390
That guy don't give a fuck.
He's a legend.

177
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,060
But uh,
when I was in a kid in high school,

178
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,530
oh,
he's,

179
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,040
he's olds.
Fuck yeah,

180
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,410
he's a pro.
Well those guys,

181
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,260
they all.
That's a hard way to make a at that.

182
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,790
At Age 79,
he had a good run.

183
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,780
Yeah.
That's a good run for,

184
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,643
for those guys.
That's a fucking hard way to make a 

185
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:26,210
living.
But have we were talking about,

186
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,300
uh,
the,

187
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,650
the idea of neanderthals is like having 
a Ca,

188
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,060
a confrontational hunting style?
No,

189
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,830
I don't think we have because when,
when,

190
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,230
when anthropologists look at the,
the skeletal remains of neanderthals,

191
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,064
they see this sort of suite of this 
pattern of injuries on them and a 

192
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,084
researcher is looking at the types of 
fractures that they have on their bones 

193
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,340
in where the fractures occurred and the 
breaks and cracks

194
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,173
and they're scholes.
He was looking at all this and wound up 

195
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,740
working with a doctor who had a lot of 
exposure to rodeo riders,

196
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,094
bull riders and the doctor was,
was observing the way in which that 

197
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:17,940
suite of injuries was very familiar to 
him from rodeo riders,

198
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,670
the types of breaks and the location of 
brakes.

199
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,130
And this guy has this idea that they had
a,

200
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,190
like a very confrontational hunting 
style that they're mixing it up with big

201
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:30,504
animals.
And another thing they found is that 

202
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,630
when you're looking at skeletal remains 
from early people,

203
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,600
you still see that separation in the 
saxes right,

204
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,473
that,
that the males would suffer injuries at 

205
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,180
with a greater prevalence than females.
But with the neanderthals,

206
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:52,710
it seems like they didn't have the sort 
of like duplicity of roles.

207
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,430
So many of the females,
the females have the same prevalence of,

208
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,060
of these types of injuries.

209
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,370
Whoa.
And so maybe they didn't have that,

210
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,160
the,
they didn't share that division of labor

211
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,600
where the females as large as the males.
Yeah.

212
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,070
I don't know the answer to that.
So we know that they had stone tools,

213
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,780
right?
The crude stone tools.

214
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,614
Yeah.
But we don't know whether or not they 

215
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:17,130
had anything that could launch them.
Like they didn't have to.

216
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,731
They would,
do,

217
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:18,564
we know if they had spears,
I don't believe that they've found they 

218
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:24,600
had adult adult and I don't know if they
were hafting materials,

219
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,850
but they were doing,
they were doing art.

220
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,633
Um,
and I think there's a little bit of a 

221
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,010
debate about whether they're doing 
representational art,

222
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,650
but they were doing art.
They were doing,

223
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,350
they were probably making jewelry and is
like,

224
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,330
these are all things that as,
as we kind of like wake up to what these

225
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:45,600
people really like and it paints like a 
more complicated picture.

226
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,930
There's even this theory and I don't 
know if this held any water,

227
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,773
how long it was fashionable for,
but you had this really long history of 

228
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,353
it was extremely long history of 
hundreds of thousands of years in the 

229
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,730
Andrew Fall,
you know,

230
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,580
occupation in Europe and then it seemed 
to be the.

231
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,260
I remember someone putting forth this 
idea that it seemed to be that there was

232
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,094
this flourishing of advancement that was
contemporaneous with the arrival of our 

233
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,920
own ancestors in Europe is though,
uh,

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,833
they were being exposed to or seeing art
and seeing jewelry and mimicking this 

235
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,170
from these new invaders that were coming
in.

236
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,060
But I don't know where that idea sits 
right now.

237
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,923
I don't know if it's been dispelled 
because of other discoveries and 

238
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,314
everything does an interesting idea that
they would then it kind of paints this 

239
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:34,980
really sad picture,
right?

240
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:37,260
That they would be sort of in the 
autumn,

241
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,723
you know,
of their existence and here's these 

242
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:40,914
adorned people showing up with these 
amazing tool kits and all these 

243
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:47,400
abilities and kind of struggling to 
start a catch up,

244
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,500
you know,
it'd be like the country Bumpkin,

245
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,910
you know,
go into the big city and.

246
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,400
Yeah.
Well there was also this idea,

247
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,233
I think up until very recently that 
neanderthals were not as violent as 

248
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,684
humans as homo sapiens.
But now there was an article that was 

249
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,733
published just a couple of days ago that
new evidence shows that neanderthals 

250
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:08,830
like internet and tall violence between 
each other.

251
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,330
It was just as bad as homosapians.
Yeah.

252
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,050
And find that in evidence of 
cannibalism.

253
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,250
Oh yeah.
There was a lot of that.

254
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,084
Right.
Scraping of inside of the skulls 

255
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,500
indicative of tools.
Oh,

256
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:21,334
ad blocker got busted.
They get us every time with the fucking 

257
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,430
ad blocker.
Yeah.

258
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,843
Um,

259
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,553
what does it say?
Humans are just as violent as 

260
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:33,590
neanderthals.

261
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,480
Are you familiar with the writer John Mu
Allen?

262
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,490
No.
You'd like his stuff.

263
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,683
He wrote a really beautiful piece about.
He wrote a really beautiful piece about 

264
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:42,380
neanderthals not long ago.

265
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,620
Okay.
I fucked it up.

266
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,730
What they're saying is that modern 
humans were just as prone to violence as

267
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:49,920
neanderthals.
I don't have a problem.

268
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,790
I think I'm conflating this with 
something else that I read about.

269
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Inter Inter interspecies violence 
neanderthal on neanderthal violence.

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,430
The other thing that's weird about them,
as they had bigger brains than us,

271
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,220
they had bigger brains and they would be
like five,

272
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,160
seven and weighed 200 pounds.
Just jacked.

273
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,360
Just a little gorilla thing.
You know,

274
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,213
it'd be great to see it.
There is a really dumb theory that was 

275
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:18,570
being bounced around a few years ago.
It was really hilarious about how,

276
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:19,590
uh,
we wiped out.

277
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,453
We assumed that neanderthals,
because you don't have any soft tissue 

278
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:23,244
samples,
we've seen that neanderthals looked 

279
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,553
similar to humans,
but because of the very different shape 

280
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,274
of their skull this guy had,
instead of giving them European looking 

281
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:35,460
white skin,
turn them into a gorilla,

282
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,620
turned them into a giant muscle bound 
gorilla that preyed on people.

283
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,770
And this was like,
I believe it was an actually is actually

284
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:44,604
was a professor.
And it seemed almost like a goof at 

285
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:47,690
first.
Do you remember this champion?

286
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,700
We pulled this up a few times,
like killer neanderthal theory,

287
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,690
think you call it,
but he had drawn this thing black,

288
00:13:57,691 --> 00:13:58,524
like a gorilla with like giant muscles 
all over the place and these big crazy 

289
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:02,904
eyes and that painting neanderthals as a
Predator of humans and that's why we 

290
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:08,100
wiped them out.
Yeah.

291
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:08,810
Yeah.

292
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,010
That my limitations as

293
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,630
I see I,
I'll just say my limitations as an,

294
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,543
as an anthropologist,
I'm certainly not an anthropologist at 

295
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,580
all.
Just a dude who's interested in it.

296
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,600
But one of my limitations is I'll hear 
theories floated.

297
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,763
Okay.
And I don't follow them long enough to 

298
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:29,660
see which ones have any traction.
Right.

299
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,890
I'll just read about them and I don't 
take it as Gospel,

300
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,010
but I'll read about it and I'll be like,
that's interesting.

301
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:39,020
And was sort of shaped my understanding 
of it.

302
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:43,250
But then I don't keep track of it.
Like I try to really follow the story of

303
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:47,990
like the peopling of the Americas.
So when it comes to the human history of

304
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:51,560
the Western Hemisphere,
I sort of follow and like ideas will get

305
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,010
floated and

306
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,820
they'll track the idea to see where it 
lands in terms of scholarly consensus,

307
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,953
but on other stuff with neanderthals,
I'm always a sucker for a neanderthal 

308
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,800
story,
but I don't track

309
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,543
what ideas that float up or just very 
quickly denounced as being complete 

310
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:07,560
rubbish.
Mm.

311
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,700
Yeah.
It's a weird one.

312
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,490
You know,
it takes time to.

313
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,190
It takes time to follow this stuff.
Go,

314
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:17,080
go to that other picture.
That's what it is them them and,

315
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,780
and uh,
yeah.

316
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,763
But look at some of his images.
Look at that image that he has on the 

317
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:25,020
cover of the book.
Like those are the idea.

318
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,370
There's some way better ones.
There's some way better images with they

319
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,210
drew of a full body ones.
They had a.

320
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,223
is it in the article?
This was a link to your website from a 

321
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:39,060
different article.
Just go,

322
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,120
go to that and then go to images because
there was some really bizarre fucking.

323
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,661
Yeah,
there it is.

324
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:48,030
Upper left hand corner.
This is what,

325
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:48,660
this guy.

326
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,051
Yeah.
Well,

327
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:50,760
that thing,
whatever he's got going on,

328
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,020
that thing is not making art.

329
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,110
You don't think so?
No.

330
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,230
He's making meat,
man.

331
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,710
Come on.
Yeah.

332
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,540
Yeah.
It's pretty preposterous.

333
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,290
But neanderthals didn't have things like
that.

334
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,423
Did they know what is that?
He's he morphing in neanderthal into a 

335
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:13,130
gorilla that was trying to do.
Oh,

336
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,260
that's Ah,
a monkey gorilla.

337
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:17,060
Neanderthal.
But yeah.

338
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:17,841
But like,
whoa.

339
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:21,320
It's got it snarling with it's fucking 
vegetable eating teeth.

340
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,650
Anyway,
it's,

341
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,643
it's a.
and then there's the do even know what 

342
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,700
those Denovo eons to.
How do you say that word?

343
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:31,534
The one from Russia.
They didn't have any idea what they 

344
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:34,144
looked like right now.
I don't look like so pinky bones and 

345
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:36,424
shit,
you know,

346
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,170
have that.
That one's not that one.

347
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:41,110
I don't know him in your cookbook is 
fucking fantastic.

348
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,810
It's really good.
Yeah.

349
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,330
You put a lot of God damn work into that
thing.

350
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,460
We started collecting images for it 
years ago.

351
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,570
He could tell it's really good because I
didn't want it to look like I'm.

352
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,390
What was it boring you tell about 
neanderthals now I'm out of stuff to say

353
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,050
about him.
Anyway.

354
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,550
No,
I could go on for days.

355
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:04,551
That's the problem.
Things were not quite sure about exactly

356
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,690
what I heard.
That's what I do for a living.

357
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,860
So I watch I to get back to the coupe 
but real quick.

358
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:13,790
But Yo,
it's funny as a

359
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,163
um,

360
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,340
how many,
you probably don't know this,

361
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,803
but how many people in the wildlife 
world listened to your show and get 

362
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:25,510
angry about it?
Because I'm like a conduit.

363
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,100
I,
Joe,

364
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,013
that that's not how it works.
I'm like a conduit where I'm oftentimes 

365
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:32,314
getting frantic text messages is though 
I would be able to jump in and clarify 

366
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,010
like how a porcupine quill works or.
Yeah.

367
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,930
It's really funny how many people are 
here from what I can tell when you're on

368
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,783
a.
I know like when you're on the subject 

369
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:54,420
of wildlife,
if there's marijuana in the room,

370
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:57,610
we got a real issue with antlers or for.
He should really know

371
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,480
who knows what antlers for other than.
Well,

372
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,790
there are two things,
right?

373
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,040
If there for fighting and sexual 
selection,

374
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,000
right?
Yeah.

375
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,530
Two things that definitely makes sense.
We in like a sexual display,

376
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,850
we've got a bull in Utah,
this,

377
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:12,684
uh,
this year and when we were butchering 

378
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,194
it,
one of the hind quarters had been 

379
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:21,131
punctured by an antler and got infected 
and when we cut into the Hindquarter,

380
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:26,930
just this bucket of pus came out.
I mean it was fucking nasty.

381
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:27,764
We thought it was pissed at first,
like someone actually puncture the 

382
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:30,644
bladder.
And then we realized when we got deep 

383
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:36,080
into it that there was just this giant 
has and he had been asked like literally

384
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:39,890
right in the flank and it was just so 
fucking nasty.

385
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,910
Do you find really high pressure poss 
pockets in like

386
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,550
in animals all over his body.
He had holes in his ribs.

387
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:52,730
He had big one and his face had been 
jacked in the face.

388
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,960
I got to seek a deer last year who had 
lost his eye completely gone.

389
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,690
I mean like the desire ball had been 
punctured and people were asking me,

390
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:05,410
well,
no wonder you got them.

391
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,461
But I was like,
no.

392
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:10,060
It was good.
I was facing me on his line of approach.

393
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,993
It didn't know where you were.
Has left perception is a left I was 

394
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,194
facing me but yet with the cookbook,
so we started gathering pictures up for 

395
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,800
it years ago,
um,

396
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,913
because I wanted to have this really 
complete idea of how to process 

397
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:27,994
everything.
So like the book includes everything 

398
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,780
from how to process a bullfrog,
you know,

399
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,663
to a deer to pig to Mahi Mahi.
And a problem I run into when I've done 

400
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:38,104
books is I never wind up needing.
I never wind up needing a pad them in 

401
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:44,194
the end.
I always might have having like very 

402
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,370
painful cuts.
Yeah.

403
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,810
You know,
when I did my book,

404
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,580
My book,
American Buffalo member,

405
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,493
I had to lose 100 pages,
which was hard to do when we did the 

406
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:59,620
complete guide to hunting,
butchering and cooking wild game.

407
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:01,210
It came out at 700 pages.

408
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,630
Do you ever think of going back and 
putting those 100 pages back into.

409
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,920
Do you think it made sense to remove it?

410
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,000
No.
In hindsight had to happen.

411
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,620
It had to happen in terms of like the 
narrative stuff I've written.

412
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:13,910
That's the,
you know,

413
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,833
the narrative nonfiction I've written.
That's my favorite thing that I've done 

414
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,810
and uh,
it had to happen,

415
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,000
but it was painful and we did,
when I did those guidebook,

416
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:26,560
the guidebook series that came in at 700
pages and my publisher was a,

417
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,450
my publisher was like,
you know,

418
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:31,460
you just don't really make 700 page 
books.

419
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:32,294
And so that's why we wanted to do 
another volume one and volume two 

420
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:36,050
because I didn't want to get rid of any.
But then in doing this,

421
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,913
this cookbook,
the mediator fishing game cookbook is 

422
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,700
what it's called and putting this 
together.

423
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,863
I think early on we started to get a 
little bit kind of running a little bit 

424
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:48,970
wild about what was going to fit but 
then caught it earlier.

425
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,923
But that was the first thing we did is 
we started collecting the pictures 

426
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,320
because I think a lot of times you look 
at a book,

427
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,923
an illustrated book,
and it kind of smells like a photo 

428
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:59,590
shoot.
You know what I'm saying?

429
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,760
Where you can tell that they get.
They sort of how they got the images.

430
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,373
And I didn't want to feel like that.
I wanted it to sort of feel like really 

431
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,334
representative of so many different 
places and different experiences that 

432
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:17,530
are captured in here and so we just 
started filming his process shots of how

433
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:20,830
to walk stuff through like everything,
you know,

434
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,240
how to like turn things,
how to take an animal and make it into a

435
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:26,074
variety of usable ingredients and 
collecting all those took a long time 

436
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:34,020
and then and then actually like 
assembling it and putting,

437
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,020
putting it together was more systematic 
once we had that underway.

438
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,980
But I think it's like it's cool looking.
No,

439
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,621
no,
no.

440
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,350
It's great.
Like the book in the end where it's kind

441
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:46,960
of like half could almost pass as a 
coffee table book.

442
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,190
I agree.

443
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,641
Yeah.
No,

444
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,474
it really could.
And I think it's a really valuable 

445
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:51,724
resource for people that hunt because 
it's just mean he was only so many 

446
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:57,410
different ways you can cook backstraps 
right?

447
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:02,430
There's so many different ways you can 
put ground venison into spaghetti sauce,

448
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,800
you know,
you're giving people such a wide variety

449
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:08,380
of things to include in your original 
books as well.

450
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,170
A wide variety of things to,
you know,

451
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,510
to,
to cook and ways to cook them.

452
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,603
Well,
it's one of the things I really enjoyed 

453
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,600
about your show,
you know,

454
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,830
um,
and still do,

455
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:19,670
but now that it's on Netflix,
I actually,

456
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,210
I enjoy it even more,
but they,

457
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:23,160
you do a lot of cooking on your show.
Yeah.

458
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,470
That's,
that's very rare in the hunting world.

459
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,910
You know,
you see these hunting shows,

460
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,380
they're very one dimensional,
right?

461
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,920
You see someone looking for the animal 
and then they finally get it and Yay,

462
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:35,290
everybody's happy the end,
but you,

463
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,660
um,
you spend a great deal of time,

464
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,510
break it down animals and cooking a 
bunch of different things,

465
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:44,770
including like marrow and shanks and 
unusual preparations.

466
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:46,060
I think that's really important.

467
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:46,940
Yeah,
that's,

468
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,773
that's something that was,
that was always there for me growing up 

469
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,330
and hunting,
fishing.

470
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,790
Very complicated.
And you do them for a bunch of reasons.

471
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:01,380
I think that people in explaining 
hunting to audiences or explaining it to

472
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:05,310
people who are uninitiated,
uninformed about it,

473
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,740
maybe adversarial toward it.
You sort of,

474
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,150
you wind up grabbing these things that 
you end up grabbing these things that,

475
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:14,310
um,
that you think will resonate with them.

476
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,820
Right?
I have a friend,

477
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,850
Greg Blaskiewicz,
who'd even worked on this research piece

478
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:21,684
of taking justifications for hunting and
finding test subjects who are skeptical 

479
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:32,544
of hunting and explaining various 
justifications to them and seeing which 

480
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:40,770
ones of those that they find to be most 
impactful.

481
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,940
So he's actually done research around 
when you take this great,

482
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,260
like these broad spectrum of reasons 
people do this,

483
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,730
you know,
and,

484
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,180
and everyone that has many of them as 
part of their story,

485
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:53,820
right?

486
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,670
And,
and you,

487
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:55,504
you run them by people,
he sees these ones that they really 

488
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:01,640
resonate and which ones kind of move the
needle and their perception of it.

489
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,440
And it's a little bit surprising.
There's some,

490
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,500
there's some surprises in there of ones 
that you think would be really impactful

491
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,960
but in fact are not impactful at all 
that people don't care about.

492
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,190
Like what?
Well,

493
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,630
population control people don't care 
people.

494
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:15,464
I think that people don't.
The kind of people you're talking about 

495
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:19,454
who are largely unfamiliar with it.
But they're looking at it from the 

496
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,140
outside and they're skeptical of it.
They have a hard.

497
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,023
They don't buy it.
I don't think that they're afraid of 

498
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,210
deer generally,

499
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,420
but people who live in high population 
areas.

500
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:35,720
Like I did a Gig once in western 
Massachusetts.

501
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,763
Well yeah,
it was in western Massachusetts and I 

502
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:39,494
had a drive.
I was coming from New York and I had to 

503
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:46,691
drive through the most dear infested 
place I've ever been to in my life.

504
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,540
It was completely insane.
Like when you're driving on the highway,

505
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,374
you have to go 25,
30 miles an hour and things are just 

506
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:55,490
jumping in front of your car every 15,
20 seconds.

507
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:56,870
It was fucking nuts,
man.

508
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,033
And I would.
I took the side road down to get to 

509
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:01,694
wherever the Gig was and I'm just 
watching these animals jumping in front 

510
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:06,950
of the car,
like left and right.

511
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,690
And I'm like,
these people that live here,

512
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,643
these things are God damn nuisance.
Like if this was your everyday reality 

513
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,600
and you ask those people,
he said,

514
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:15,434
hey,
what do you think about deer population 

515
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:18,434
control?
We need to hunt to keep the population 

516
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:19,731
down.
They'd be like,

517
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:20,540
fuck yeah,
you do.

518
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah.

519
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,833
I'm sure.
I'm sure that there are quite a lot of 

520
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:27,180
people that live in some of these areas 
that have a great abundance of deer that

521
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:29,670
feel that way.
But with general population,

522
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:30,504
yeah.
When he was looking at it with just 

523
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:33,900
general population thing and it was full
stop to.

524
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:35,460
He didn't get.
He didn't give a lot of.

525
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,480
He didn't go in and give case scenarios 
and examples.

526
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,373
Right.
It's just a question that you ask and 

527
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:44,250
people.
It didn't immediately click with people.

528
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,080
Another thing that didn't immediately 
click with people,

529
00:25:46,081 --> 00:25:51,081
but it's extremely important to me is 
issues around heritage and legacy.

530
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,700
Okay.
So meaning that,

531
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,760
um,
my maternal grandfather,

532
00:25:56,761 --> 00:26:01,200
my paternal grandfather were hunters.
My father was a hunter.

533
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:02,730
I was brought up hunting,
um,

534
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,780
to anon.
Hunter.

535
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,720
Doesn't matter.
Your grandparents and parents could have

536
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:08,220
been involved in all kinds of bad shit.

537
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,203
I don't need that.
That means you need to continue doing 

538
00:26:10,711 --> 00:26:11,544
bad shit.
I'm one that's very obvious is people 

539
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:15,984
understand,
people understand and respect the idea 

540
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:20,430
of food.
Like,

541
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,230
uh,
your general population,

542
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,050
look and respect the idea of food now 
tobacco,

543
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:25,884
what I was getting at about,
you mentioned that being a big element 

544
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:29,820
of the show.
Uh,

545
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,073
it almost winds up being that it was 
like I was like fortunate or lucky or 

546
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:35,751
whatever that,
that,

547
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:40,751
that early in my career I started 
focusing on talking about that aspect of

548
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:42,054
it.
But it wasn't something I just made up 

549
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:43,494
out of because it was a huge part of 
growing up where for whatever reason I 

550
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:48,534
happen to be raised by a dad who was 
just really interested in cooking stuff 

551
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:57,330
and sharing with people,
you know.

552
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,193
And if he,
if you're driving down the road in June 

553
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,380
and you see a snapping turtle laying 
eggs on the side of the road,

554
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:05,214
it's come up out of a swamp and you 
needed to find some sandy ground and he 

555
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:09,030
finds it on the edge of a dirt road.

556
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,811
And there it is.
Land,

557
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:13,610
eggs on the side of the dirt road.
We were eating that turtle right?

558
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,980
And everything we ate,
you know,

559
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,903
all kinds of fish.
And we had a lot of things that other 

560
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:19,644
people weren't interested in.
We could go out and bring back our dad 

561
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,360
bullfrogs you would love if we went out 
and got them.

562
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:25,194
Frogs.
We take our bows out at night using 

563
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:28,044
flashlights,
which unbeknownst to me was illegal and 

564
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,384
remains illegal in the state where I was
brought up even for frog to use 

565
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:34,170
artificial light for frogs.
Yeah.

566
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,243
Wow.
I had no dude when I found that out 

567
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,370
later.
No idea.

568
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,880
Wow.
Um,

569
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,340
the day that you weren't supposed to do 
that,

570
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,440
where we would do it and we'd come in 
and bring them.

571
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,240
And it was like a big thing,
right?

572
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:46,074
To bring her dad the frog legs and he 
would cook them and he would cook and 

573
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:48,510
eat anything.

574
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,343
And then he would do stuff where we 
would catch salmon when the salmon were 

575
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:55,170
running the rivers in October and he 
would have people over and we would have

576
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:57,120
a salmon boil,
you know?

577
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,560
So I was raised around that stuff of,
of celebrating wild game.

578
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:04,650
Having to be very social,
having to be a way to connect salmon.

579
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:05,850
Boil.
Yeah.

580
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,490
Boiled fish.
So you take your little,

581
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,333
you're just,
you're literally cubing up salmon and 

582
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:15,460
Pearl onions and little baby potatoes.
Oh you.

583
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:18,390
So you're making like a stew,
a fish boil,

584
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,333
and then you drain it off and you have 
drawn butter and you drown all that 

585
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:22,740
shit.
And drawn butter.

586
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,540
It's good.
Sounds good.

587
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,160
Yeah,
it doesn't sound.

588
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,930
We'll do fish boils.
People do fish.

589
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:30,090
Boyles was not normal to do a salmon 
boil.

590
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,960
It seems like it's such a flavorful fish
would lose some of that in the broth.

591
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,823
Yeah,
for sure.

592
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,190
But it's like when you.
It's like when you have the Pearl onions

593
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,073
and a little baby potatoes and cubed up 
and you drown all that shit and bought 

594
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:41,971
her.
It's just like a thing.

595
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:42,804
People like the taste is really good,
but it's not necessarily the taste of 

596
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:46,410
salmon.
It isn't.

597
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:50,220
What if you went to great.
If you went to the Pacific northwest and

598
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:51,054
asked like a bunch of great chefs in the
Pacific northwest to list their five 

599
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:59,751
favorite stamen preparations,
boiling them in a pot of water isn't,

600
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,790
isn't going to be on.
Is it going to make their list?

601
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,180
But he would do that,
you know,

602
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:08,460
and it'd be a thing and you'd invite 
people over to do it.

603
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:14,150
So I kinda early at like early on with 
all the things I enjoyed about hunting,

604
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,080
I'm like,
the food aspect was big for me in really

605
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:19,914
informed all of the sorts of 
conversations that I've had around it 

606
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,620
since.

607
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,453
And so then in doing a show about 
hunting wasn't something that was going 

608
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:29,444
to.
It wasn't something that I was going to 

609
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:32,370
lean out.
But in all fairness,

610
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,473
when I was growing up,
I did a lot of fur trapping too and 

611
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,760
trapped muskrats,
beaver,

612
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,230
mink,
all kinds of stuff.

613
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,363
And um,
was doing that to sell the sell the 

614
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,014
furs.
And I would use some of the meat out of 

615
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,533
you.
Some of the meat for Bait at sometimes 

616
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,113
sell meat to dog sled racers.
When did you realize that beaver were 

617
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:52,450
delicious?
Not till after.

618
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,800
I think I know the first one when I was 
in the first one I ever ate,

619
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,653
I was in community college.
I still tell people about the beaver 

620
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:02,770
that you cook for us and Wisconsin and 
how good it is.

621
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:04,720
And they look at you sideways and Mike,
I'm telling you,

622
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,030
man,
it was like the most delicious pot roast

623
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:08,530
I've ever had was fantastic.

624
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,030
Yeah,
it was really good.

625
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,893
There's even stories about early on with
the one early explorers are in this 

626
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:15,934
country.
They had a difficult time getting fish 

627
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:18,034
sometimes.
And beaver were approved for the lenten 

628
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:26,000
meal because they were aquatic.
Yes.

629
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,853
So on Fridays when you had to have,
like when you're supposed to have your 

630
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:29,584
meat free day,
you were allowed to eat beaver meat 

631
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:34,960
because they were a water animal.
It was a very popular food item.

632
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,030
You follow what I'm saying?
Yeah,

633
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:37,481
yeah,
yeah.

634
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:38,200
No,
I get it.

635
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,330
The first one,
the first ones we ate,

636
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,210
I had started reading about,
I'd always read narratives,

637
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,880
stories about the mountain men.
Um,

638
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,460
meaning like when I say mountain,
like a very specific thing,

639
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:50,170
like a,
you know,

640
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,093
a rocky mountain beaver trapper who was 
sandwiched between who is sandwiched in 

641
00:30:56,711 --> 00:31:01,711
time between the end of the Lewis and 
Clark expedition and the collapse of the

642
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,860
beaver market in the 1840 [inaudible].

643
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,230
So like they're a very finite period of 
time.

644
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,083
Was what a mountain man was explained to
people how big the market is because 

645
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:15,040
this is going to blow people's minds.
Well,

646
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,490
America's first asked her,
John Jacob Astor,

647
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,430
like the beaver market made America's 
first millionaires.

648
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,510
His fortunes came from being a beaver 
trader.

649
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,560
The,
the richest men in the country.

650
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,110
Their money came from beavers.
Yeah.

651
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:32,100
And he was in on the business end of it.
He wasn't another trap and end of it.

652
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,840
He was in on the habits for companies.
Yeah.

653
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:38,080
The big companies,
like when we bought,

654
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,633
think about like this,
how big it was for us to do the 

655
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:44,470
Louisiana purchase and buy that chunk of
land.

656
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,760
Uh,
when Lewis and Clark came out,

657
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:49,594
part of their mandate was to suss out 
the potential for the trade and beaver 

658
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:55,654
hides.

659
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,660
It'd be like buying some oil and gas.
Right?

660
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,900
You don't know it.
Can we justify this?

661
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,743
The oil and gas,
they're looking to justify it through 

662
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,280
trade and beaver heights.
Now also,

663
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,613
there was also language about that.
They might find out about whether wooly 

664
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,800
mammoth through existing out there as 
well.

665
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,110
So there was some confusion about what 
was going on.

666
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,360
Wow.
They really thought that woolly mammoths

667
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:17,194
were still alive.
Jefferson was interested in that stuff 

668
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:21,130
because he had,
he had been to some areas,

669
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,293
uh,
he had some familiarity and to some 

670
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:26,220
areas with these large bones and he was 
puzzled the bottom.

671
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,063
He was wondering if this wasn't some,
if it may be in fact was not an extinct 

672
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:30,994
species,
but was somehow living in the American 

673
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:35,740
west still.
How hard is it to the historians,

674
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:37,020
like people,
not historian,

675
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,280
popular historians really loved to make 
a big deal out of that.

676
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,230
X is so weird,
but it wasn't like,

677
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:43,430
Hey,
let's buy the,

678
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,293
let's do the Louisiana purchase 
transaction because of the possibility 

679
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,714
of locating Mamet's.
I think it was an idea that was floated 

680
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:51,620
around.
People see it in a.

681
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,090
people such as me see it and perhaps 
overemphasized what it meant.

682
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:56,924
But it was an idea that was out there.
The beaver trade stuff was certainly a 

683
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:01,784
big factor.
Another thing I was reading about 

684
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,850
recently that just point out to your,
to your,

685
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:05,684
uh,
that you might think is interesting is 

686
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:09,644
that we as people have this idea of 
Lewis and Clark going into this 

687
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,813
unspoiled uncontacted landscape.
I was recently reading a piece by a 

688
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,633
historian who's talking about at the 
time of Lewis and Clark headed out into 

689
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:22,664
the great plains.
There were native Americans living on 

690
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:25,724
the great plains who had been to Europe 
and met the King of France and returned 

691
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,270
back to the great plains.

692
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,330
What year they,
they went out in the early 18 hundreds.

693
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,070
So they're out in 18.
Oh,

694
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:42,740
four.
Wow.

695
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,460
You gotta if you imagine the time from 
the time I'm in the 15 hundreds when the

696
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,580
Spanish.
Right.

697
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,410
We're poking around and come like Corn 
Otto,

698
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,693
right.
Coming up from Mexico into the great 

699
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:01,994
plains.
Cabeza de Vaca being shipwrecked along 

700
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,353
the Gulf coast and people pushing up 
into these areas that was hundreds of 

701
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,000
years prior.
Like the distance that separates.

702
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,250
Imagine the distance.
It's separated.

703
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,084
Lewis and Clark from the first year 
peons who were doing activities in and 

704
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:24,050
around the great plains is like the 
distance and time that separates us from

705
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:26,570
Lewis and Clark more so.
Right?

706
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,090
Yeah.
It's the distance in time that separates

707
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:29,924
us from the declaration of independence.
It was like a long history of people 

708
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:33,800
messing around.
Crazy.

709
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:34,730
However.
So yeah.

710
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:35,564
But think about too,
like Lewis and Clark were encountering 

711
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:38,090
people who had horses.

712
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,923
Right?
Right.

713
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,360
And those horses had been his horsemen 
traded up.

714
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,700
So that is like a side note to this idea
of eating beaver.

715
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:49,340
So I got from reading about the mountain
men.

716
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,233
I got interested in this because you 
always do like anytime you read about 

717
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:52,874
mountain and you're going to find the 
part where the author talks about how 

718
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:55,664
much mountain men like beaver tail and 
the first people that tried and be 

719
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:01,823
retailing was around when I was.
I was in community college at the time 

720
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,503
and my brothers,
I remember stuck a b retail in the oven 

721
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,043
for awhile and cooked it and they 
reported back to me that like whatever 

722
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:13,184
it is they're talking about a isn't that
like there must be some other 

723
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,480
explanation.
Didn't we eat beaver tail?

724
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,260
Yeah,
yeah,

725
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,280
we ate it and was constantly.
We have a,

726
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,153
there's a,
there's a how to pictures and an 

727
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:26,924
explanation of how to prepare,
how to actually prepare beaver tail 

728
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:32,960
mountain man style in the media.
You're fishing game cookbook.

729
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,990
It wasn't bad.
It was a blend.

730
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,100
It's just fat.
It's so

731
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,193
after that we started thinking that when
they say the mountain and like be 

732
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:43,044
retail,
we thought it most amended like rump 

733
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,560
based,
like the hind quarters.

734
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,160
So we started when we went I would catch
beavers.

735
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,473
Um,
I'd be careful when Skin Adam's not get 

736
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:55,710
the caster.
The beavers have two large glands on the

737
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:57,450
inside of their legs.
They're like tucked in there.

738
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,730
It looks like if you lay a beaver on its
back,

739
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,093
talked to kind of on either side of its 
of its like if it's a male I talked to 

740
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:06,450
you,
your side of his penis or either side of

741
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:08,790
it's Clo Eiko you'll.
You'll see a,

742
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,220
not waco but like vent.
You'll see these.

743
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,960
These glands that are the size of.
I don't know if you make like a.

744
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,490
If you take your index finger and your 
thumb and make a circle,

745
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,700
there's like a gland on each side called
the castor gland.

746
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,020
There's oil gland in there.
They used to use it for perfume.

747
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,110
It still has value today.
It's used for a wide variety of things.

748
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:25,944
It smells beautiful.
If you ever walking on the stream bank 

749
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,580
and you smell like a strange perfume 
smell,

750
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,800
it's usually beaver caster.
Wow.

751
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,570
Smells great.
Tastes like shit.

752
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,303
Tastes like you're eating.
Like you rubbed roses or something all 

753
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:38,754
over your food.
So started figuring out like to skin 

754
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:45,420
them and be very careful not to get the 
cast or on your knife or get the cast on

755
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:46,254
your hands and then we would just take 
the meat and put it in crock pots with 

756
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:53,820
potatoes and onions and stuff and just 
cook them down in a crock pot.

757
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,740
You could pick them and it was like 
roast beef.

758
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,770
So when I started eating that,
but I still.

759
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,643
Then later I realized that the read 
other accounts of how people are 

760
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:02,714
prepared be retail and if you take the 
tail like the scaly ass tail and it 

761
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:08,400
really should be from a fall,
beaver,

762
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,560
[inaudible] the tail would be twice as 
thick in the fall.

763
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,840
Then in the spring or a macerated in the
spring,

764
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,200
take the tail into skewered on a stick 
and put it next to a fire where the skin

765
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:20,034
starts to bubble and boiled away and 
pretty soon you can just peel that skin 

766
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:28,110
away and was hiding under.
There is the the best equivalent,

767
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:28,944
like the best equivalent or point of 
comparison that I can think of would be 

768
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:33,984
to just.
It's like if you had a really like 

769
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,800
imagining you're getting a grass fed 
steak,

770
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,100
right,
but still has that fatty gristle on it.

771
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,383
It's just made up of that gristle like 
what allow people to trim away from 

772
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,720
mistake and not eat.
That's what's inside that beavertail,

773
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,883
but people eat these individuals that 
we're doing this for fat starved eating 

774
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:56,394
such lean meat all the time.
I think they loved it because here's 

775
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:00,930
like a chunk of fat,
you know,

776
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,783
and they had ready access to it because 
they catching them to make a living and 

777
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,440
if you're just eating the meat,
there's no fat on the meat.

778
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,843
And so they would compliment it with 
just eating the beavertail fat and I'll 

779
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:16,220
often tell people about it and I even 
gave some to the.

780
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,123
There's like a,
a culinary arts institute and I gave 

781
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:20,604
some chefs that stuff and everyone who 
eats it points out there's not that it 

782
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:24,504
tastes so fantastic,
but just like really interesting to try 

783
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:29,250
and eat it.
The fat from the tail.

784
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,710
And it's like you've got to put yourself
in position.

785
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:33,190
You've probably been in this too where 
if you're,

786
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,650
especially if you're out hunting and 
eating

787
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,903
freeze dried food or not eating great 
and you're just exerting yourself all 

788
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,490
day all the time,
how you're,

789
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,270
what you want to eat changes a lot.
Yeah.

790
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,340
And you the level of appetite.
I was off the charts.

791
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,373
Yeah.
And so just like to eat like a big slab 

792
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:51,670
of fat,
it'd be very excited.

793
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:52,970
It was appealing to people.
Yeah.

794
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,813
Your,
your body starts craving things that 

795
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,600
absolutely needs.
Yeah,

796
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,210
that makes sense.
Makes Sense.

797
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,443
In particularly when you think about 
these people that are hiking across the 

798
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:03,514
west,
traveling massive amounts of distance 

799
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,303
and you know,
probably very physically strenuous 

800
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,063
dragon,
all their shit with them and they get a 

801
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,420
cross some big ass piece of fat from a 
tail.

802
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:15,280
It's probably a huge treat.
Yeah.

803
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:19,060
And then our understanding of people 
like we used to have this idea of like,

804
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:21,670
especially of early native Americans is 
like,

805
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,490
they're like just eating,
you know,

806
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,050
nothing but mammoth meat and all the 
time,

807
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,840
like as our understanding of people 
grows,

808
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,683
you see like how much they are utilizing
plant resources and probably had like 

809
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,940
pretty plant rich diets.

810
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:39,510
But with the one with the equestrian 
bison hunters on the great plains,

811
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,213
those guys were.
They weren't cultivating at that era 

812
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,260
like especially the era when Lewis and 
Clark came in.

813
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,510
These people,
we're not cultivating crops.

814
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,373
A lot of the people who had been farming
along the Mississippi and Missouri 

815
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,040
Valleys,
once they got horses,

816
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,173
they just gave up on that shit and just 
started Roman landscape eaten meat and 

817
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,840
the mountain men certainly weren't doing
that.

818
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,723
They were just eating like you're eating
meat 365 days out of the year and you 

819
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:12,070
see that they really probably to make up
for a lot of nutrient deficiencies.

820
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,040
Eight shitloads.
Oregon's your guy,

821
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,250
the gall putting Gol on your food,
gallbladder,

822
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,020
squeezing,
taking the garb,

823
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,893
the putting,
squeezing the bile from gallbladder on 

824
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:27,100
your food.
You did that once.

825
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:28,030
Yeah,
it's horrific.

826
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,983
Yeah.
Well they put a nine volt battery on 

827
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:30,754
your tongue and you think they were 
doing just because they were just 

828
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:33,760
nutrient starved?

829
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,020
Yeah,
it seems like they,

830
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,003
they,
they put a high emphasis on eating just 

831
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,460
like all these,
like just organ meats,

832
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,710
organ meats,
milk from milk,

833
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:44,620
from mammary glands.
Really?

834
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,760
Yeah.
Because you can't just eat that.

835
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:47,210
Leanne ass gave me every.
Right.

836
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,930
You were talking to a guy from Alaska.
What's that guy's name?

837
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,793
Buck.
Buck.

838
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,010
Buck Bowden.
No,

839
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,230
on your show.
And he was talking about um,

840
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,213
you know,
essentially he was subsistence hunting 

841
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,670
in certain stages and you know,
he ate nothing but Moose,

842
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,713
like he shot a moose and ate nothing but
that Moose for months and pick and 

843
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:12,240
wolverine and eat off the skulls.
And so I whoa know,

844
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,383
you know,
so fucking modern day human who's alive 

845
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:20,791
right now talking about only surviving 
on the leanest of lean meat.

846
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,073
You know,
like I had to be skinny as fuck when 

847
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,080
that was all over and I would mess with 
that guy.

848
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,190
He's tough shit,
dude.

849
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,760
Yeah.
He,

850
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,620
he lived the life he lived a life that 
seems like he had parts of his life that

851
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:35,090
seemed like was 100 years.
Yeah,

852
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,530
it could have occurred 100 years 
earlier.

853
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,251
He,
uh,

854
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:39,710
the episode of the podcast is like,
you're a good man.

855
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,670
Fuck.
Is that what it's called?

856
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:41,990
You're cool dude.
Cool Dude.

857
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,833
Buck,
which is body mind says to him in the 

858
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:45,883
shower,
you know,

859
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,620
he's a cool dude.
It's,

860
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,190
it's a treat to get a chance to talk to 
a guy that you think probably never even

861
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,260
fucking heard of a podcast,
uh,

862
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,810
and certainly comes from a completely 
different era.

863
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,783
The reason he was living had to live off
the land is an interesting story where 

864
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,913
he was working for.
He was just getting into the guiding 

865
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,074
world,
so guiding Moose hunters and they were 

866
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:08,654
wanting to find some ways to be able to 
hunt some very remote areas and they 

867
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,444
hidden in us the idea that they would 
just bring horses in because if you 

868
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:17,210
don't have landing strips and stuff is 
just really hard to operate out of these

869
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:17,420
areas.

870
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,021
So they thought,
well,

871
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:20,920
if we can get horses in there,
we'll have them in there,

872
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:23,210
will want for the season.
Then we'll ride the horses out.

873
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,540
But getting the horses in there,
it was so difficult.

874
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,433
It took far longer.
The route they wanted to use was 

875
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,043
impassable.
By the time they got the horses in 

876
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:33,704
there,
they realized that they're never going 

877
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:35,114
to get these horses back Outta here and 
they realize that someone needs to stay 

878
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:42,590
over winter to take care of the horses 
and he has volunteered to do it.

879
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,233
So he started spending.
They would go in and hunt in September 

880
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:52,700
and then he would just start hanging out
and just stay there to agree to care for

881
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:53,534
the horses until spring.
So that's how he found himself living 

882
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,920
out by himself.
And they would bring some food in,

883
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:04,100
but it would be never enough and he 
would be eating wolverine,

884
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:05,120
beaver,
Moose,

885
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,160
whatever he could come up with.

886
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,920
But he was just,
um,

887
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:15,130
he was just open to it and didn't care 
and was really comfortable with solitude

888
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,180
when I spend time with him,
he's very gracious.

889
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,860
But um,
when he spent time with them,

890
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:26,861
you see him just engage in conversation.
You see a,

891
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,990
uh,
a,

892
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,833
a sort of weariness kick in where you're
talking to someone who's very 

893
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:37,550
comfortable going months without human 
interaction.

894
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,920
Right?
So him talking to people like,

895
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:40,940
okay,
that's enough,

896
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,670
let me get the fuck out of house.
And you realize like when I've stayed at

897
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:45,740
his place,
his cabin and he's got,

898
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,870
he's got a remote cabins stolen when I 
stayed out there.

899
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:48,704
You kinda like,
we'll sort of drift off and vanish for 

900
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,000
good spells.
Sure.

901
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,950
Even when he's,
even when he's like entertaining,

902
00:43:54,951 --> 00:43:57,890
you know,
and he sells bowls like wooden bowls for

903
00:43:57,891 --> 00:43:58,671
living.
Well,

904
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:02,630
it's one of the things that he does have
one of those bowls.

905
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,080
I have one in my home now.
I need to get one of those bowls.

906
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:05,901
Birch.
Yeah.

907
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:07,250
It's like a,
you know,

908
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:08,084
it's like a salad bowl.
So like a growth on the side of a birch 

909
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:12,500
tree that you cut off with a chainsaw 
and hollow out.

910
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,710
Know they call them Birch Birch Bark or 
burl?

911
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,400
Both.
Yeah.

912
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,100
Yeah.
I have a beautiful one.

913
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,530
And he sells and they go into terrorists
shops.

914
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:24,350
I think it's a shame that they go into 
tourist shops.

915
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:25,820
Yeah,
I think he should be.

916
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,610
It should be all be direct consumer.
Well from him.

917
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,473
Why don't you hook it up?
Taking zero point zero people on the 

918
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:32,360
case

919
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,750
gauge some of your meat.
Meat Eater.

920
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,043
Yeah.
He had a great many of the lost in a 

921
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:37,990
fire too.
Yeah,

922
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,910
that was a sad story.
But besides.

923
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,130
Yeah.
So he's still guides and um,

924
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,220
does that and makes his uh,
you know,

925
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:45,680
takes some time

926
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,970
Berles and makes bowls out of him.
Just talking to a guy like that.

927
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,823
Listening to you talk to a guy like that
is so fascinating because he lives a 

928
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:56,050
life that I can barely comprehend.
Just everything about it from.

929
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,550
And just to think that,

930
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:00,783
well,
what he does is almost impossible to 

931
00:45:02,141 --> 00:45:02,974
comprehend now think about Lewis and 
Clark making their way across the 

932
00:45:05,951 --> 00:45:10,950
country and not really knowing what was 
out there really not knowing like,

933
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,290
guessing,
having some people gave some reports.

934
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,270
This is what we saw here.
This is what we saw there.

935
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,030
They didn't even have a good account of 
all the different animals.

936
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,590
No,
they had won or lost.

937
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:23,280
And that's the thing we were talking 
about this point.

938
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,133
There are days we're talking about like 
what people now you'll hear people say 

939
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:27,171
like,
oh,

940
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:28,400
he's a real mountain man.
You know?

941
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,930
And oftentimes when people hear that 
they imagined this old hermit,

942
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,040
yeah.
You know,

943
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,590
who's living in his cabin,
um,

944
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,380
him being a mountain man.
But if you think about what the mountain

945
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:42,470
men were,
they were for the time,

946
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,590
the most well traveled people,
right?

947
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:49,520
And the least.
Zena phobic people alive.

948
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,610
The equivalent today to be a mountain 
man today,

949
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:55,550
the equivalent would be,
I think you'd have to go to,

950
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,953
um,
presuming and ascend the Amazon and 

951
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:04,214
follow tributary after tributary and get
into like the borderlands around 

952
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:13,661
Venezuela and then go in and despite the
language barrier,

953
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:21,310
you'd have to go in and travel amongst 
and live amongst people who,

954
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:24,403
um,
tribes who had not had a lot of outside 

955
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:27,734
contact but had a familiarity,
had a familiarity with outside peoples 

956
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,033
and you'd live there foods you eat their
foods and live with them and take their 

957
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,260
ways that they dress themselves and 
adopted as your own.

958
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,753
The kind of guy that would do that is 
not the kind of guy we're talking about 

959
00:46:47,331 --> 00:46:49,700
nowadays when we talk about.
He's a real mountain man,

960
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:50,743
right?
We're talking about reality show people 

961
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,613
that people talk about now.
But these people were like insatiably 

962
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:01,370
curious explorers.
They're the people now,

963
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:02,803
the people that do like go to really 
crazy war zones or like decided to go 

964
00:47:06,981 --> 00:47:09,920
backpack up in the Hindu Kush and 
Afghanistan,

965
00:47:09,921 --> 00:47:11,870
you know,
just see what happens.

966
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:13,940
Um,
yeah,

967
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,500
very different kinds of people.

968
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,810
Your episodes that you did,
what?

969
00:47:17,811 --> 00:47:18,644
Where,
where was that in with the most recent 

970
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:26,381
series where your boat fishing with 
these people?

971
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,900
Yeah,
down in Guyana.

972
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,090
Diana.
Yeah.

973
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,930
That's a.
that's got to be a trip.

974
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,510
How long were you down there for?
Oh look,

975
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,860
you know,
long weeks.

976
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,450
Couple of weeks.
Yeah,

977
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,090
yeah,
yeah.

978
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,250
I mean,
but there's a lot of travel.

979
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:41,590
There's a lot of stuff needs to happen 
to get out on the river,

980
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,593
but when you're around these people and 
they're all walking around barefoot and 

981
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:48,190
they're making cassava,
which we talked about the other day,

982
00:47:48,191 --> 00:47:50,980
that it could easily kill you if you do 
it wrong.

983
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,460
The water as all this cyanide in it,
like you're,

984
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:59,461
you're about as close as you can get to 
that kind of environment.

985
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,191
Right?
Yeah.

986
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:05,191
What you're in a situation like that you
with people who are very familiar with,

987
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:07,030
like where are you familiar with the 
modern world?

988
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:10,480
Like a great awareness of it,
but like when the,

989
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,360
when the rubber meets the road of daily 
existence,

990
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:18,361
they're still really connected to life 
patterns and skillsets that were,

991
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:25,750
that their grandparents used and still 
fishing like a very similar ways.

992
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,460
Right.
So

993
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,473
where you might've had,
when you were a boy lehman is someone 

994
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,580
now is in their thirties,
when they were a boy,

995
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:35,414
they probably use a 12 pound handmade 
wooden paddle and maybe now they have a 

996
00:48:38,841 --> 00:48:41,180
different paddler.
Maybe somehow they've come into,

997
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,403
you know,
a plastic paddle say and they use that 

998
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:48,890
for their boat or they have a,
they still have a dug out canoe,

999
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,210
but they also have an aluminum boat.
So there's major differences.

1000
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,620
But just the general sort of approach 
and the fact that you're deriving all of

1001
00:48:57,621 --> 00:49:02,621
your protein from the river and that you
hunt and fish 250 300 days a year in the

1002
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,080
places where your ancestors have always 
done it.

1003
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:10,303
You're still,
you're still gaining this really 

1004
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:16,510
beautiful glimpse at how people lived.
Even though they've had enormous changes

1005
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,880
in their own lifetime and are very much 
modern,

1006
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,140
you know,
very modern,

1007
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:23,720
but you can still like glimpse it more.
You don't.

1008
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,880
I don't think you really get that as 
much.

1009
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,540
You don't get that as much here.
You know,

1010
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,140
hunting is his ancestral.
Right,

1011
00:49:33,141 --> 00:49:35,630
and there's this kind of continuation 
that goes on.

1012
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,930
But when Europeans came here,
when,

1013
00:49:38,931 --> 00:49:43,931
when Europeans came to the new world,
they weren't coming in as hunters.

1014
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,850
Right?

1015
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,390
If you have to go look like Daniel 
Boone's family,

1016
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,670
Dana Boone's family came from England.
They didn't come here as hunters because

1017
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,890
you could like the peasantry you 
couldn't hunt there.

1018
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,263
They came here and learned hunting.
So hunting and America for Euro 

1019
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,633
Americans,
hunting and America is like an 

1020
00:50:03,481 --> 00:50:04,314
invention.
It's a thing that people kind of got to 

1021
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,430
learn and took from the Indians.
So it doesn't have a.

1022
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,103
It doesn't have that.
Like that deep deep thread that you'd 

1023
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:18,960
find with indigenous communities where 
there's.

1024
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:23,370
This continuation has gone on for 
forever on broken,

1025
00:50:23,371 --> 00:50:25,470
but on this continent unbroken for 
whatever,

1026
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:26,310
15,
16,

1027
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:29,000
whatever the fashionable number is 
thousands of years.

1028
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,133
Right.
And so it's like our understanding is 

1029
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,080
different because our,
like my ancestors came here and got into

1030
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:36,914
it.

1031
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,773
It wasn't a,
it wasn't a cultural continuation for 

1032
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:43,220
them.
And then when you look at like for,

1033
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:46,670
for food and wild game.
And an interesting thing is my,

1034
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,470
uh,
my use and understanding of wild game is

1035
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,040
really influenced by like contemporary 
food,

1036
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,660
right?
Like,

1037
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,600
like restaurant food,
things that chefs do.

1038
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:01,760
Like how do you take wild game and do 
these like cool,

1039
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:02,900
exciting,
modern,

1040
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,470
innovative kinds of things with,
with wild game and cook it,

1041
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:07,503
you go talk to her like a dude,
even though dude like Bach or 

1042
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:12,470
particularly people in people in South 
America who have,

1043
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:16,640
have haunted for more of a,
like a subsistence literally subsistence

1044
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,474
purposes.
Their whole attitude is different about 

1045
00:51:19,071 --> 00:51:21,860
it.
People like people in South America will

1046
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:25,260
eat that.
Like the,

1047
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:30,910
the Chimani or the Macuna is like 
they'll eat the same thing every day for

1048
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:33,080
lunch,
everyday

1049
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:35,503
boiled fish with a dried pepper on it.
And then a grain made from cassava 

1050
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,830
boiled as well,
why is he a grain?

1051
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:45,720
But like a dish made from cassava.
Why they boiling it?

1052
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,240
Why,
why don't they just grill it?

1053
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,090
They,
they,

1054
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:48,923
they sometimes do.
But for lunch it's like you take 

1055
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:51,380
leftover.
You might,

1056
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:52,214
you'd probably like smoked with.
Were they able to call barbecue fish 

1057
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:57,080
where you make a big rack,
you have a fire and make a big rack high

1058
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,520
above it,
it kicks off a bunch of smoke.

1059
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,080
You split fish,
salt,

1060
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,630
lamb on that rack and smoke them,
dry them out,

1061
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:08,050
and then you take that fish and break it
apart and poor river water over cassava.

1062
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,373
Um,
and then put fish in there with river 

1063
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:18,350
water and kind of stir it up or you just
take fish and throw it in a pot and boil

1064
00:52:18,351 --> 00:52:19,430
it and put that on there.

1065
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,430
But to eat that same thing every day.
Then you come and talk about,

1066
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:24,920
uh,
there's no recipe,

1067
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,233
there's no like written preparation and 
then you come and talk about like wild 

1068
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:30,074
game cook is.
I understand that where you make a book 

1069
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:34,910
and it's got 100 different recipes and,
and all these ways to approach stuff.

1070
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,230
It's just like it's very particular to 
us,

1071
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:42,980
like other people aren't really 
perceiving it that way,

1072
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,960
like they don't use wild game and 
recipes.

1073
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:45,890
They have like a,
there's like,

1074
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:46,903
here's how you cook this and we don't 
really deviate from cooking this way 

1075
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,880
where it's like fish on a rack over to 
fire or efficient,

1076
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,410
a pot of water and very limited diet.

1077
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,833
Does it weird you out when you're around
people like that because you have 

1078
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,740
options,
right?

1079
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,770
You can,
you can eat any way you like.

1080
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,260
You can go to a restaurant,
you get a burger from fast food,

1081
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,960
you choose to go hunting with these 
people.

1082
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:15,530
It's literally how they survive and 
there's no option.

1083
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,810
There's no options and they've been 
doing it that way forever.

1084
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:18,913
Like is it,
do you feel like a weird recreational 

1085
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:24,100
sort of person around them?
Like is it.

1086
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,070
Does it feel?

1087
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,530
That's a great question man.
I'm no,

1088
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:35,090
there's definitely,
there's definitely like an,

1089
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:40,150
an envious part two how to live that 
deliberately.

1090
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:46,390
Like I'm a little bit envious of it,
but really the thing that I feel most,

1091
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,600
I feel I'm more than separated.
I,

1092
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:54,610
I tend to feel more of the areas in 
which I'd be like aligned,

1093
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,173
you know,
where like appreciate the perspective 

1094
00:53:59,021 --> 00:54:02,170
and I appreciate the skill set but never
feeling,

1095
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:03,004
um,

1096
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,490
yeah,
never feeling like,

1097
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,373
like a fuller ashamed or something that 
this would be something that I would 

1098
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:10,903
choose to engage in and this is 
something that they were engaged in and 

1099
00:54:13,611 --> 00:54:14,444
I think they're,
one of the things that helps make it 

1100
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:18,800
that way is how much they love to do it.
Right.

1101
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,023
That when you go out,
like the infectious excitement of 

1102
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:26,750
heading out in the morning,
the fact that they still feel it.

1103
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,520
Like there is Giddy is anybody about 
going out and doing it,

1104
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,760
like very excited to go out and do it.
It is not like going out to get your,

1105
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,850
like to get you to check your mailbox.

1106
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,880
My uh,
my youngest daughter has become enamored

1107
00:54:40,881 --> 00:54:44,240
with fishing and I love it because I get
to,

1108
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:46,600
whenever we go on trips,
I take her fishy,

1109
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,443
fucking loves it man.
And we were in Florida and we're going 

1110
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,950
to get to go bass fishing.
I set it up.

1111
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,400
Had a guy who was going to take us out.
I woke her up 5:00

1112
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:57,140
in the morning in the hotel.
I'm carrying her.

1113
00:54:57,141 --> 00:54:59,060
She's stiff as a board because she just 
woke up.

1114
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,590
She's like,
I'm so excited.

1115
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,250
She was so excited.
She wasn't like,

1116
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:05,390
Daddy,
I'm tired.

1117
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:07,880
Can we just go back to bed now?
It was dark out five in the morning.

1118
00:55:07,881 --> 00:55:08,714
She's just calling.
I'm so excited that you want to have 

1119
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,800
fun.
She caught it six pound bass.

1120
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,110
Then she's hooked.
She's got quite a few bass.

1121
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:19,280
It was a great lake in in Florida,
in Florida.

1122
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,960
Obviously a lot of great bass fishing 
there,

1123
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:24,800
but we caught a ton of large mouth bass 
and she caught up fat boy.

1124
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,070
It was like a six pounder.
She was freaking yet had bit her finger.

1125
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,290
She was showing everybody look at bit my
finger.

1126
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:33,350
She was so excited.
She fucking loves fishing,

1127
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:34,423
but that feeling in the morning when I'm
looking at her little face and like 

1128
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,770
we're on the water,
like it's a genetic thing.

1129
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,220
It seems like it's just in the DNA.
The fishing is.

1130
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:44,270
It's not like,
hey,

1131
00:55:44,271 --> 00:55:46,550
we're going to go play soccer,
which she likes to,

1132
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,840
but there's not that kind of excitement.
Now there's like,

1133
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,710
oh,
there's gonna be so fun.

1134
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:52,873
There's like,
it's triggering something that is deep 

1135
00:55:56,541 --> 00:56:00,560
inside human beings.
I see it and I see it in.

1136
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,480
I see it in varying degrees and in 
different people.

1137
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,240
Like some kids seem to come out of the 
box with more of it.

1138
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:10,530
Yeah.
You know?

1139
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,370
Yeah.
My own.

1140
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,540
I don't mean that as a euphemism.

1141
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,120
No,
it might.

1142
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,460
My 10,
10 year old daughter doesn't.

1143
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,211
She's like,
yeah,

1144
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:19,610
we can go fishing.
Like she's gone fishing and stuff.

1145
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:20,780
It's okay.
It's okay.

1146
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:21,410
When

1147
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:21,850
I,
when,

1148
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:24,040
when we had a daughter,
my wife

1149
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,930
was adamant,
you know,

1150
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,793
early on,
soon as she found out what it was gonna 

1151
00:56:28,281 --> 00:56:29,114
be a daughter like that,
you will not exclude our daughter in 

1152
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:35,650
this world that you're in.
I was like,

1153
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:36,250
oh,
of course not.

1154
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,370
You know,
and I,

1155
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,260
and I don't.
But uh,

1156
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:43,860
having in my mind,
I don't feel like I've messed this up.

1157
00:56:43,861 --> 00:56:46,920
I feel like I've put the same emphasis 
right on my.

1158
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:48,510
I have three kids,
but my older two,

1159
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,043
I'm the little one just a little bit too
little yet to really know what's going 

1160
00:56:52,441 --> 00:56:53,830
on,
but the old chair,

1161
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,673
I feel like I put the same emphasis on 
it and my daughter just isn't 

1162
00:56:58,231 --> 00:57:03,231
demonstrating the same enthusiasm that 
her older brother does.

1163
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:04,763
And you and you try to suss out like the
nature nurture question because I feel 

1164
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,080
like I'm doing the same inputs.
Right.

1165
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,730
But I'm getting different results and it
leads you to wonder,

1166
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,860
um,
you know,

1167
00:57:16,861 --> 00:57:20,460
it's a very small sample size,
but when I talked to other parents,

1168
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,470
like parents who are parenting right 
now,

1169
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:23,304
young kids,
I just keep encountering other dads who 

1170
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:32,481
are having the same experience and it 
really leads you to wonder,

1171
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:38,520
sort of like what sort of cultural 
influences are going on there,

1172
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,373
where it's like the enthusiasm 
oftentimes among young girls are not as 

1173
00:57:44,101 --> 00:57:45,900
high as the enthusiasm among bugs.

1174
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,310
It's hard to unpack.
I don't know.

1175
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:49,930
It's hard to unpack everything.
Yeah,

1176
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:50,764
that's,
that's my question is I don't know how 

1177
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:56,170
old your kids,
while the two on talking about are eight

1178
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:57,070
and five.
Yeah,

1179
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:57,904
man,
I don't know how much culture plays a 

1180
00:57:58,751 --> 00:57:59,530
part.
I know,

1181
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:00,363
I really think that it's,
and it's obviously in my small sample 

1182
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:06,250
group and eight year old and a 10 year 
old for the youngest kids,

1183
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,650
the uh,
the eight year old fucking loves it.

1184
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,540
They're both girls,
the 10 year old,

1185
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:11,530
she's like,
whatever,

1186
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,210
you know,
if I tried to wake her up,

1187
00:58:13,211 --> 00:58:15,330
take her fish and she'd be like,
leave me alone.

1188
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,840
I'm going back to sleep.

1189
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,190
I'm sure there are parents out there 
who,

1190
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,010
you know,
I haven't met him yet.

1191
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,873
Maybe they're out there where they have 
like a boy and a girl and the girls 

1192
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,720
fired up and the boys not maybe

1193
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:30,330
I guarantee you there's,
Jamie and I were just talking about this

1194
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:32,490
yesterday because I was watching this 
video of these.

1195
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,533
There's,
I want to try to put this in a 

1196
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:40,410
respectful way.
Um,

1197
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,590
I think they're,
I'm sure you're aware of this.

1198
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,230
There's people that are in the hunting 
world,

1199
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,064
the outdoor industry that I think are in
it because it's a good avenue to get 

1200
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:54,390
attention.
If you're like a hot chick.

1201
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:55,363
Yeah.
If you're a hot check and you know you 

1202
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:58,920
wear pink and you go out and shoot 
things,

1203
00:58:58,921 --> 00:58:59,754
you take all these grip and grins with 
deer and you're gonna get a lot of 

1204
00:59:02,491 --> 00:59:03,660
likes.
Yeah.

1205
00:59:03,661 --> 00:59:04,494
Because it's.

1206
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:08,240
Imagine the,
the male perspective on it.

1207
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:09,123
Yeah.
It's like here's the woman who has 

1208
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:10,840
everything.

1209
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,610
Exactly.
And she likes to hunt.

1210
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,503
Yeah.
She's hot and she likes to hunt and 

1211
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:19,630
there's quite a few of them and it's.
I was telling Jamie,

1212
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:24,631
it's a weird world because part of me,
I don't want to be a sexist.

1213
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:26,300
I don't want to look at these girls and 
I mean I don't.

1214
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,553
I don't look at a guy who hunts and who 
wants to be a part of the outdoor 

1215
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:31,671
industry and go,
Oh,

1216
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:32,504
this guy is just doing this because he 
thinks this is his avenue for fame and 

1217
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,580
success.
I think,

1218
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,533
well,
here's a guy who really likes to hunt 

1219
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,543
and he realizes there's people like 
Steve Rinella and John Dudley out there 

1220
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:46,450
and these famous haunters man,
I want to be a famous hunter.

1221
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,380
How do I do it?
How do I go?

1222
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,330
Well,
I'm going to just start taking instagram

1223
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:51,164
pictures and say a lot of the same shit 
that they say and sort of put myself 

1224
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:58,430
into the cultural norm.
I don't think like that with girls

1225
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,350
because you're like,
you just want to.

1226
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,850
Not all of them,
a lot of them I think are super legit.

1227
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,684
A lot of.
But there's unquestionably this added 

1228
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:08,564
element in that world and it with it.
Let's be super generous and say it's 

1229
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:17,381
only 10 percent of them,
but that 10 percent of my smell a rat.

1230
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,530
I'm not unaware of what you're talking 
about.

1231
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,500
Sharing.
You know?

1232
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:22,520
I notice it.
Yeah.

1233
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,580
Yeah.
I even had like A.

1234
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:26,950
Yeah,
I remember was.

1235
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,690
Yeah,
it is Kinda like A.

1236
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:30,591
Yeah,
like a,

1237
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,350
like a,
like,

1238
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:34,490
like a sex pot kind of hunters scene,
you know?

1239
01:00:34,491 --> 01:00:35,100
Yeah.

1240
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,980
Super made up full war paint,
fake eyelashes.

1241
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,130
Hot as fuck.
Skin tight clothes out there.

1242
01:00:42,131 --> 01:00:44,290
Shooting Shit.
Taking pictures.

1243
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:45,371
Yeah.
It's weird.

1244
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:46,204
And then you go to their instagram page 
and it's like there's pictures of that 

1245
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:50,254
and then there's a lot of pictures with 
their butt up in the air where they're 

1246
01:00:52,151 --> 01:00:52,984
doing some strange exercise.
Getting ready for both things and 

1247
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,770
accentuating there,
but like,

1248
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,920
that's weird.
I don't do any of those exercises.

1249
01:00:59,010 --> 01:00:59,843
I really liked you.
I know I would really like to because 

1250
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,253
I'm going to continue leaning on my own 
to continue leaning on my daughter 

1251
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,530
because I would really like her.

1252
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,450
I want to keep leaning on her and so I 
feel like she's in the ad age or she can

1253
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:17,980
legitimately say she doesn't want to go.
Right.

1254
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,640
Because right now if I asked her 
everyday,

1255
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,523
hey you want to go to school,
she'd be having real delinquency 

1256
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,330
problem.
So you're like,

1257
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,720
you know,
you really like a,

1258
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:27,863
you make kids do stuff.
I took her duck on a couple of weekends 

1259
01:01:29,911 --> 01:01:30,744
ago and it was cold morning and we get 
out there and before it's even legal 

1260
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:36,990
light,
she's felt terrible.

1261
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,960
She's laying there crying about colder 
feet are.

1262
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,233
If my boy was doing that,
I would have a very different attitude 

1263
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:47,574
about it.
Then when she's crying her crank and 

1264
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:51,744
she's cold,

1265
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,690
like made me feel awful with my boy.
I've been like,

1266
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,380
suck it up for her.
I'm like,

1267
01:02:00,381 --> 01:02:03,170
Oh man,
she's all cold now.

1268
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,290
Yeah,
and then it makes it so you really,

1269
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,750
there really is a difference.
Yeah,

1270
01:02:08,751 --> 01:02:09,380
there's,
there's a,

1271
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,800
there's a difference there and it's not,
you know,

1272
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,170
the people that buy a hunting license in
this country,

1273
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,860
90 percent of people by hunting,
90 percent are males,

1274
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,003
right?
Right.

1275
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,780
So one in 10 license holders is a woman,
but then there's,

1276
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,653
there's more women than men in the 
slightly more men women than men in the 

1277
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:29,730
country and there's a ton of ways of 
explaining it.

1278
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:30,564
We talked about earlier with 
neanderthals or maybe an inner falls 

1279
01:02:32,121 --> 01:02:37,121
didn't have these divided roles,
but in all the hunter in hunter gatherer

1280
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:38,394
cultures is very normal to see a 
division of labor here and to have like 

1281
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:45,390
the men were out hunting and women,
we're not.

1282
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:47,760
There's a bunch of explanations for 
that.

1283
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:51,700
Like people were tied to being home to 
care for small children and you know,

1284
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,860
couldn't afford that risk to something.
Do they vary?

1285
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:58,020
There's some women that go out with the 
hunting parties,

1286
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,080
you know,
if it is,

1287
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:00,840
I mean,
you know,

1288
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,673
the minute you say no,
someone was going to point out to some 

1289
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,430
right.
Variation,

1290
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,880
but in your experience,
you've,

1291
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,980
you've done several of these trips to 
these remote jungles.

1292
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,510
Oh yeah.
But that's just,

1293
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,220
that's such a small thing.
I mean,

1294
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:15,054
you get a,
rather than looking at personal 

1295
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:16,794
experience just from kind of exploring 
literature and reading about historic 

1296
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:22,770
accounts and what people found in what 
people do,

1297
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,753
uh,
it is very much the norm is very much 

1298
01:03:26,191 --> 01:03:29,040
the norm that hunting was,
you know,

1299
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:32,730
patrilineal descent activity in all 
these cultures.

1300
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:37,290
You go to like the cult of the hunter is
like a male sort of coal,

1301
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:41,040
but the factors that made it that way.

1302
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,690
Okay.
The sort of the,

1303
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:45,900
you you have to assume it comes from 
some kind of practical factor.

1304
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:46,734
Right?
The factors that made that way aren't 

1305
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:48,444
there anymore.
And I said it's a difficult thing to 

1306
01:03:51,391 --> 01:03:52,224
unpack if it winds up being that if I 
have two boys and one girl winds up 

1307
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:57,240
being that,
uh,

1308
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,733
both boys become avid hunters and 
fishermen and somehow my daughter does 

1309
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:06,264
not.
I'll probably view it as some bit of a 

1310
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:09,264
personal failure.
I'll never know what really was going 

1311
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:12,264
on.
Like I said,

1312
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,750
it's hard to like unload it.
I wish I could have 100 children like 50

1313
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:17,990
girls and 50 boys and have a bigger 
samples,

1314
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,431
but I,
you know,

1315
01:04:20,431 --> 01:04:23,460
I do wonder about it and what's funny 
too is there's no,

1316
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:27,110
like at our home,
our kids are,

1317
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:27,944
our kids eat tons of wild game at our 
home to the point where they don't have 

1318
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:32,663
any.

1319
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:33,983
You could give them anything to eat.
They would eat it and it would not 

1320
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:43,851
register to them is unusual.
They've eaten everything right.

1321
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,460
They've even eaten breakfast sausage 
made out of Fox and beaver meat.

1322
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,850
They've eaten Fox.
Yeah,

1323
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,580
they've eaten everything.
Wait a minute.

1324
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,190
Yeah.
You Eat Fox a half.

1325
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,760
I made a batch of breakfast sausages 
because I had an Arctic Fox one time and

1326
01:04:56,761 --> 01:04:58,950
I made breakfast sausage out of it.
What was that like?

1327
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:01,340
I just caught it in with beaver meat,
a little bit.

1328
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:02,183
Deer meat and a little bit of pork fat.
My kids ate it and then every wink you 

1329
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:08,100
try any of the Fox on its own?
Nope.

1330
01:05:08,101 --> 01:05:11,160
Didn't try the Fox on its own.
I've seen a ton of things,

1331
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:11,994
but I didn't eat just straight old 
possessed you to stuff that Fox into 

1332
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:18,400
that sausage.
I heard that they were good and I had an

1333
01:05:18,401 --> 01:05:21,400
Arctic Fox and I wanted to get a thing 
made if my wife from it.

1334
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:23,783
So I had a hat,
the Arctic Fox hat made for and then I 

1335
01:05:26,761 --> 01:05:27,594
retained the meat and then we just ate 
the meat and breakfast sausage and then 

1336
01:05:29,911 --> 01:05:31,140
like if I told him,
you know,

1337
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:33,710
if they were to ask like what meat it is
now I would say,

1338
01:05:33,711 --> 01:05:35,130
oh,
it's know this,

1339
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:38,310
this and this.
It wouldn't freak them out.

1340
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:39,990
It wouldn't,
it wouldn't even know.

1341
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:40,824
It wouldn't even register as like a,
a thing that might seem unusual to some 

1342
01:05:44,371 --> 01:05:47,460
people.
So the squirrel rabbit all manner stuff,

1343
01:05:47,461 --> 01:05:49,470
right.
The just anything.

1344
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:50,723
And so I know there's no element of,
there's no influence like that with 

1345
01:05:54,301 --> 01:05:56,250
them.
There's no influence of,

1346
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,010
oh that's gross or you,
that's weird.

1347
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:00,323
You know,
their day we were hunting the other day 

1348
01:06:01,231 --> 01:06:03,630
we went out and we're hunting street 
pigeons,

1349
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:05,820
you know,
and they'll eat pigeon meat.

1350
01:06:05,821 --> 01:06:07,440
And where were you doing this?
In Montana.

1351
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:08,850
Oh,
okay.

1352
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:09,970
Yeah.
Uh,

1353
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:13,380
there's like a guy at a grain silo that 
was infested with pigeons.

1354
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:17,190
Folks don't know that many people 
listening to this,

1355
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,650
that pigeons were actually brought over 
here as food.

1356
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,890
And when you get like fancy squad on the
menu,

1357
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,760
that's what a pigeon is.
No flightless pigeon pigeon hasn't flown

1358
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:28,140
yet.
That's what a squad is.

1359
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,330
So smaller and younger.
That's the idea.

1360
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,021
Yeah.
The meats,

1361
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:31,854
pinkish on the meats,
pinkish on squad if you want to get 

1362
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:34,524
squad.
But we used to go out and catch squads 

1363
01:06:35,551 --> 01:06:37,950
where we had,
we had like a little,

1364
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:41,370
almost like the equivalent of a little 
trap line where they would,

1365
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:42,930
uh,
you know,

1366
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:43,764
Nasa and various places around town and 
we would just know all the places to go 

1367
01:06:47,551 --> 01:06:50,790
check to get squabbles.
And yeah,

1368
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:52,380
it's one that hasn't flown yet.
So,

1369
01:06:52,381 --> 01:06:54,750
but you know,
people that commercially produced squad,

1370
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,050
you can just keep them from flying.
But if you want squad from the wild,

1371
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,960
you need to go out and you know,
you just go and collect them.

1372
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,230
And what's the difference between pigeon
and squad in terms of the way it taste?

1373
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,950
Pigeon meat is tougher.
Grayer,

1374
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,373
uh,
has more livery quality and squad is 

1375
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:18,230
like very tender pinkish,
like it's lean.

1376
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,173
It's not like quail,
but it's leaning way more in the 

1377
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:26,241
direction of quail.
Like it'd be like if a pigeon in a quail

1378
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:32,490
had a baby squads more like that.
It's,

1379
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,480
it's one of the biggest surprises I had 
in.

1380
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,600
That was one of the biggest surprises 
that I've ever had in,

1381
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:40,823
in game.
What if we can count that as wild game 

1382
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,183
would be what a squad tasted like 
because I had been eating it for a long 

1383
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:49,014
time.
Eating Street pigeons because no street 

1384
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,410
pigeons,
you know,

1385
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,180
they're around even up in the Missouri 
breaks,

1386
01:07:54,181 --> 01:07:55,900
you got street pinch that nest up in 
the,

1387
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,360
in the cliffs and you know,
you can,

1388
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,213
you,
there's many places you can hunt street 

1389
01:07:59,311 --> 01:08:03,150
pigeons and they become a agricultural 
past and they're not regulated.

1390
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:06,360
So there's no closed season,
no bag limit,

1391
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:07,823
right?

1392
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,870
They're treated like they have no more 
regulated.

1393
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,713
Like rats.
If you could talk to wildlife managers 

1394
01:08:14,071 --> 01:08:17,090
and ask them if they could wave a magic 
wand and make street pigeons go away.

1395
01:08:17,091 --> 01:08:19,580
Most everybody would waive it because 
they're so costly.

1396
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,370
They're costly to cities.
They're costly to agriculture.

1397
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,560
Um,
so I'd always eat and pigeons,

1398
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:28,840
but the minute of discovering,
discovering like what a squad was like,

1399
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:31,280
which is well known to people in the 
fine dining,

1400
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:35,330
but I had never had it.
It was shocking how good it is.

1401
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:39,020
That's interesting.
I've never picked it off the menu,

1402
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:40,490
but now I'm tented.
Yeah,

1403
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,030
you should do it.
But street pigeon.

1404
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:43,230
Should I avoid that?
No.

1405
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:46,580
I would eat something first just to test
it and make lattes from it.

1406
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:47,653
Okay.
But it's not something that you would 

1407
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:49,063
go,
this is one of my favorite things to 

1408
01:08:49,731 --> 01:08:50,720
eat.
No.

1409
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,930
Is there a way to do it where you could 
really like,

1410
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:56,000
is there a preparation maybe that you've
missed?

1411
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,793
It's not bad to,
to put it in a marinade and you can 

1412
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:05,730
grill it.
You know what?

1413
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,480
You want to take little brass and you 
poke it whole bunch,

1414
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,373
like poke it with a fork and tenderize a
little bit and also make some like 

1415
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:16,520
avenues of approach for the marinade and
grill them over.

1416
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:18,330
Very hot flame.
Um,

1417
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,993
but what was good is like to use it like
similar to like stuff with Ptarmigan or 

1418
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:23,864
whatever is to make patties and Tureens 
Ptarmigan is something that you would 

1419
01:09:27,061 --> 01:09:27,894
cook that way as well.
I've only seen people do Ptarmigan on 

1420
01:09:30,711 --> 01:09:31,544
that,
uh,

1421
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:35,600
with sexual called life below zero.
So a lady who lives,

1422
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:38,930
she's been on the show before,
she lives like fucking hell.

1423
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,810
What does she live like 200 miles above 
the arctic circle.

1424
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:46,100
Something crazy like that.
And she hunts Ptarmigan up there.

1425
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,790
The best time I've ever eaten in this is
we,

1426
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,210
this is in,
in our new cookbook too,

1427
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:56,390
but I mentioned using Ptarmigan for it,
but it's just a,

1428
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:59,150
a dish that's great for regular,
like any,

1429
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:01,220
any kind of meat particularly gamers is 
like you have,

1430
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,300
you have,
you had hot pot.

1431
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,140
Yeah.
Where you like,

1432
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,100
where you have the,
you know,

1433
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,013
you have like the simmering broth.
And you have all these raw like raw 

1434
01:10:09,351 --> 01:10:11,550
sliced meats that you dip in there.

1435
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,830
The best timing I've ever had is like 
that.

1436
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,450
Hmm.
It's,

1437
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,400
it's other worldly,
you know,

1438
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:20,234
it's just kinda like,
like Kinda like when you slice it thin 

1439
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:23,960
and cooked that way I just kind of 
vanishes on your tongue.

1440
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,820
It's a very,
very tender meat.

1441
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:26,654
You can almost kind of mash it up.
People like a thing you hear with a lot 

1442
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:31,090
of gamers.
People described harm.

1443
01:10:31,091 --> 01:10:32,690
Again,
treat street pigeon,

1444
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:35,870
lot of game birds people describe as 
livery diving,

1445
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:39,320
ducks being livery because it was like a
texture thing to it.

1446
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:42,110
And in the strength of flavor,
in a darkness of color.

1447
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:47,320
Um,
and those people make a lot of pathways.

1448
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,163
Liver,
right?

1449
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,930
So those birds that have that quality,
oftentimes they just,

1450
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,560
they can find their way into patties.
So we also have recipes for that.

1451
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,400
Like how to do pat taste from using all,
all manner of meat.

1452
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:01,100
Do you have any recipes in the book for 
Brown bear?

1453
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,680
No,
but we have bare recipes.

1454
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,200
Is there a difference?
You know,

1455
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,453
Brown,
black bears are among people who know 

1456
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:15,510
blackbirds are widely accepted as being 
good to eat.

1457
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:16,973
If you go into,
if you go to earlier I mentioned Daniel 

1458
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:20,881
Boone's,
so if you go into that,

1459
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:24,180
like the frontier era of American 
history,

1460
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:25,014
right?
Which proceeded just these little lingo 

1461
01:11:26,281 --> 01:11:27,114
terms.
The frontier era of American history 

1462
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:29,304
proceeded the mountain man era of 
American history with like the eastern 

1463
01:11:32,461 --> 01:11:33,294
settlements,
right?

1464
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,960
Um,
if you read it like about Daniel Boone's

1465
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:38,300
area,
you know,

1466
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:40,140
early 17,
hundreds up into,

1467
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:41,660
uh,
you know,

1468
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:45,900
open to the revolutionary war.
Bear me was the most popular meet on the

1469
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,880
frontier.
Black bears.

1470
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:52,380
The most popular is in preferred,
preferred over venison.

1471
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,430
Really?
Yeah.

1472
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:56,820
People hunted deer to sell deer hides 
and they would eat the deer meat.

1473
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,350
People want to barriers to that.
That's what they like to eat late.

1474
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,740
So there's more beef like,
you know,

1475
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:04,200
and you know,
when cooked right?

1476
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:08,340
People love bear meat,
a brown bears.

1477
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:11,460
Grizzly bears just don't enjoy the same 
reputation.

1478
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:14,070
Um,
different diets.

1479
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:18,420
One run in with Brown when we use it,
when we use the term Brown,

1480
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:20,040
like brown bear is kind of almost like 
a,

1481
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:24,600
like a.
it's used amongst hunters a lot,

1482
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:26,790
but it is all.
It's all one species,

1483
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:27,624
so whether you've got a grizzly bear in 
Wyoming or a brown bear on Kodiak 

1484
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:34,110
taxonomically,
it's regarded as as a single species.

1485
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,730
People Call Brown bear.
Brown bear is a grizzly.

1486
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,850
You'll get all kinds of people.
Right,

1487
01:12:40,851 --> 01:12:43,310
and you to say this about various points
of this book,

1488
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,800
like debating various aspects of this.
A brown bear is a grizzly with access to

1489
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:51,143
marine resources were marine resources 
make up a major component of it's diet 

1490
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:58,170
and then the question you bring up is 
then like if you go to the north slope,

1491
01:12:58,171 --> 01:13:01,770
so if you go to the Arctic coast and you
saw a grizzly there,

1492
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,521
you'd be like,
well,

1493
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:04,380
he has access to marine resources.

1494
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:06,930
He can eat a beached whale,
whatever,

1495
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:12,300
but he's a grizzly.
So like brown bears kind of extend right

1496
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:17,301
from northern BC up around and Hook 
around into the bering sea,

1497
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:21,270
but at some point they're just not brown
bears anymore and there he,

1498
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:26,220
they tend to be big and,
and oftentimes because of the name,

1499
01:13:26,221 --> 01:13:28,050
like the tend to have like a darker 
coloration,

1500
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:32,080
they have a horrible reputation is food.
You'll always find people who will point

1501
01:13:32,081 --> 01:13:32,970
it out,
right.

1502
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:37,830
Or nowadays because people are so aware,
like in the social media world nowadays,

1503
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:40,590
you'll have people that will kill a 
brown bear and here you are,

1504
01:13:40,591 --> 01:13:45,591
you've got four or 500 pounds of meat 
and they'll talk about how they're going

1505
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,790
to eat it.
But like dude,

1506
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:51,510
you're in for a pound a day this year.
Really?

1507
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,290
Is that really what happened for real?
Is that really what happened?

1508
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:56,220
That's true.
Right?

1509
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,080
And then there's no salvage requirement 
on it.

1510
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,570
Uh,
there was no salvage requirement on it.

1511
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:02,940
Don't you have to in Alaska?
Don't you have to pack it out?

1512
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,030
Depends,
there's some areas that have zero.

1513
01:14:06,031 --> 01:14:11,031
Some areas you know,
typically typically no,

1514
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,140
but there are areas that do have salvage
requirements where I have a cabin,

1515
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:14,974
there's a salvage requirement on bear 
meat in the spring because in areas 

1516
01:14:18,341 --> 01:14:20,600
where bears.
So that's a black but yours,

1517
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,970
your cabin is that there?
It's island by island,

1518
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,080
so somehow like the ABC islands,
like,

1519
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,173
like you know you go to Admiralty 
Islands in Admiralty Islands is all 

1520
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:33,634
brown bears,
so it winds up being that if the island 

1521
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:40,950
is good brown bear habitat,
it will only have brown bears because on

1522
01:14:41,111 --> 01:14:41,944
the islands where it's smaller,
they just would kill all the 

1523
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,073
blackberries.
They're there and blackbirds aren't 

1524
01:14:47,351 --> 01:14:48,184
there.
If the island is not brown bear habitat 

1525
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,830
and can't support brown bears,
it will become a black bear island.

1526
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:56,920
Prince Wales is a black bear island,
Admiral Tom Brown,

1527
01:14:56,921 --> 01:14:57,754
bear island and you know,
it kind of depends on how much seems to 

1528
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:04,240
maybe depending on how much like open 
country or Alpine or you know,

1529
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:05,343
if it's like densely densely forested,
it's less suitable and becomes a black 

1530
01:15:10,361 --> 01:15:11,194
bear territory.
But black bears in the spring have a 

1531
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:17,710
salvage requirement because if you're 
talking about coastal bears,

1532
01:15:17,711 --> 01:15:18,544
coastal bears are better to eat in the 
spring when they're not eating tons of 

1533
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:21,904
rotten salmon in the fall.
There wouldn't be a salvage requirement 

1534
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
because when they're eating dead salmon,
their flesh can become not good.

1535
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,113
I remember you telling me a story about 
using the guy smoker and he told the 

1536
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:34,451
guy,
man,

1537
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:37,540
you need to clean that smoker out.
Smells like fish.

1538
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:38,643
He's like,
I've never cooked efficient [inaudible] 

1539
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:41,830
you.
You were smoking a barren it.

1540
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:42,760
Yup.
And that was a.

1541
01:15:42,761 --> 01:15:45,460
That was an early June in early June.

1542
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,870
Blackberry,
who's not getting salmon,

1543
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:47,704
but it's just.
It stores up that that flavor stores on 

1544
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,254
their fat.
I've watched even woves eating salmon 

1545
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:58,111
that were so rotten that they're like 
lapping it up where it just turns into a

1546
01:15:58,871 --> 01:15:59,704
grey Bush into the bears and people's 
idea of a bear is like eating a brand 

1547
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:05,344
new fresh fish,
which they love to do and they seem to 

1548
01:16:06,881 --> 01:16:08,830
prefer it.
Like when there's tons of fresh fish and

1549
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,900
they're just getting fresh fish,
they'll just eat eggs.

1550
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:14,230
Right?
But as the fish run dies down,

1551
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:16,450
they just start eating rotten fish.
Um,

1552
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:19,480
I can't remember how we got to talking 
about quality food.

1553
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:21,020
Oh,
were you asking?

1554
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:24,340
So even like Mark Bowden's Buck Bowden,
who,

1555
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:25,263
like I said,
he's picked the head meat off of 

1556
01:16:26,701 --> 01:16:27,534
Wolverine skull to eat it,
but bowden and said he struggled his 

1557
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:31,670
entire life.
Um,

1558
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:36,100
and just hasn't found a way to make 
brown bears that good.

1559
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:40,770
There are exceptions.
People run into good taste in one's the,

1560
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,680
you know,
I was talking about like,

1561
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:44,440
grizzlies up on the north slope have a 
very good reputation.

1562
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:49,850
Any black bear in the rockies,
any is good.

1563
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:51,913
I mean,
I've heard stories like I had a body 

1564
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:57,310
that kill one over a dead cow one time 
he killed and it was scavenging a rotten

1565
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,840
cow and he had a hard time with the 
meat.

1566
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,010
But generally

1567
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:06,900
bears that aren't eaten,
marine resources are pretty,

1568
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,280
are phenomenally good.

1569
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,910
Talk to my friend Eric Weinstein 
yesterday.

1570
01:17:11,911 --> 01:17:14,550
He's a mathematician.
One of the smartest guys I know.

1571
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,473
And uh,
he is been fascinated by my obsession 

1572
01:17:18,511 --> 01:17:19,344
with hunting.
And so he started watching a bunch of 

1573
01:17:21,181 --> 01:17:23,610
hunting things online and he said he was
very put off.

1574
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,113
I saw people killing bears with spears 
and celebrating and the way they were 

1575
01:17:29,641 --> 01:17:31,020
celebrating about stuff.
He's like,

1576
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,670
you found the thing,
the whole thing,

1577
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:33,953
I,
you know,

1578
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:38,360
and I saw his point and we had this 
discussion about it where,

1579
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,180
um,
you know,

1580
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,083
acknowledging the need to control the 
population and that this is all that 

1581
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:46,893
they're allocated a certain amount of 
tags by wildlife biologist and this 

1582
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:53,520
keeps the moose population healthy and 
the deer population,

1583
01:17:53,521 --> 01:17:54,690
oh,
all these different things.

1584
01:17:54,691 --> 01:17:57,240
And even that people eat them.
All those things made sense to him.

1585
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:02,520
But the celebration and the all the 
hooting and hollering and stuff,

1586
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,130
he's like,
there was just not enough of a reverence

1587
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:06,840
for the dead.
And it really,

1588
01:18:06,841 --> 01:18:07,770
really disturbed them.

1589
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,830
Yeah,
that's,

1590
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:15,690
it's a great subject and it's hard to.
It's hard to approach because.

1591
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:20,090
So you find so many contradictions in 
weird parts of it.

1592
01:18:20,091 --> 01:18:24,350
And by that I mean this,
I was having a conversation tonight with

1593
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:26,090
a gentlemen over dinner and we're 
talking about.

1594
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:28,063
He was explained to me what is the role 
of a rancher and what is the role of 

1595
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,000
farmer?
Here's the person who's bringing animals

1596
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:35,834
into life.
He's propagating breeding animals with 

1597
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,504
the sole intention that they will all 
die and he will make his living off of 

1598
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:45,674
their death,
but that person remains a sort of 

1599
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:55,820
cultural icon.
They enjoy like a celebration.

1600
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:58,850
You know when you're trying to sell,
sell a pickup truck,

1601
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:02,150
right?
If you can tie it to a rancher,

1602
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:03,913
it makes that pickup trucks.
He more legitimate that celebrated 

1603
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,040
character and be like,
oh,

1604
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,000
he's an old cowboy.

1605
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,350
Yeah,
and we like that.

1606
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:10,980
It's like,
what does it.

1607
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:12,440
Not that I'm definitely not knocking 
them.

1608
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:15,680
Let me get where I'm going with this,
but what is that like?

1609
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,573
That person is based off of like rearing
animals in order that they may die and 

1610
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:25,514
he profits from their death and remain 
celebrated and then you get into the 

1611
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:32,450
idea of what?
In a way,

1612
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:37,480
when it comes to American wildlife where
we have a population of wildlife,

1613
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:39,554
many respects we have it and enjoy the 
management that we do and the abundance 

1614
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:48,260
that we do in many ways that abundance 
is supported,

1615
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:50,750
bolstered,
financed by hunters,

1616
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:56,500
but hunters tend to not enjoy that same 
cultural support because of the death.

1617
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,810
Well,
it's also because of media depictions.

1618
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,640
Sure.
I think that's the big part of it.

1619
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:08,550
More than even so than the if are.

1620
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,533
If all of our depictions about hunting,
we're tied into this sort of rational 

1621
01:20:13,741 --> 01:20:18,741
discourse and they showed all the images
from your show of animals being shot and

1622
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:23,970
carefully butchered in the field and 
then prepared and cooked and enjoyed.

1623
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,400
I think people would have a way,
different perception,

1624
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:27,623
but we have elmer fudd and we have the 
evil hunters and the movies that are 

1625
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:34,800
always trying to torture the animals.
I mean it's,

1626
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:35,723
it's Disney and anthropomorphization of 
these animals and all these different 

1627
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:44,751
films and media depictions and books 
that Shit and then teddy bears all these

1628
01:20:44,821 --> 01:20:45,654
things.
They're like stained into people's 

1629
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:49,560
brains of what's good and what's bad.
You know,

1630
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:53,950
very few kids have stuffed cows that 
their pets are,

1631
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,823
that their toys,
they have teddy bears and maybe rudolph 

1632
01:20:57,451 --> 01:20:59,490
the red nose reindeer.
You don't want to shoot Rudolph.

1633
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:00,413
No.
It seems to.

1634
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:04,080
It seems that it gets much worse and 
more contentious.

1635
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:09,240
The less the pop.
If the American population is looking at

1636
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:10,074
something that they recognize as game,
they feel different things that they 

1637
01:21:14,731 --> 01:21:15,564
don't recognize this game that they 
don't readily recognizes game to see 

1638
01:21:20,011 --> 01:21:24,210
that death is more abhorrent to them 
even if it is being treated as game,

1639
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:25,283
but like you don't like you,
you don't see social media explosions 

1640
01:21:28,501 --> 01:21:31,020
come up around someone with a Turkey,
right?

1641
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,990
You don't see a lot of social media 
explosions come up with someone around a

1642
01:21:33,991 --> 01:21:34,824
white tail.
Deer.

1643
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,750
People look at that.
They see this animal that they perceived

1644
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:41,610
to be very abundant in the case of white
tails and Turkeys are correct,

1645
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,340
very abundant.
They're familiar with them.

1646
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:45,443
They're familiar with the idea of these 
things being haunted and it feels 

1647
01:21:48,301 --> 01:21:49,200
different.
Now,

1648
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:51,780
if there's things where there's a 
perceived scarcity,

1649
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:53,423
okay,

1650
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:59,120
and they don't immediately recognize it 
as a food item,

1651
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,033
it's hard for them extremely in this is 
way outside of my personal area of 

1652
01:22:05,181 --> 01:22:07,970
expertise,
but why like what goes on in Africa,

1653
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:09,013
but for people to see animals in Africa 
that had been hunted and they recognize 

1654
01:22:12,771 --> 01:22:13,770
them only from like

1655
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:17,370
film depictions,
cartoon depictions,

1656
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:19,920
mobiles over their child's Crib,
like,

1657
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:20,873
like a hippopotamus is very like,
you can't look at that and it's hard to 

1658
01:22:24,181 --> 01:22:25,014
see that as like the harvest of game.
It becomes something very different and 

1659
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:33,780
it's.
We've watched it happen with bears,

1660
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,093
you know?
Also a thing that will happen is if you 

1661
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:42,240
initiate the hunting of something that 
wasn't hunted before,

1662
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:43,763
that's very difficult for people.
So you take a state where like New 

1663
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:51,630
Jersey or Florida where they for a long 
time historically they would have a bear

1664
01:22:51,631 --> 01:22:53,850
season.
They would lose the bear,

1665
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:56,160
so the bear sees would go away because 
of a,

1666
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,043
of a resource scarcity.
Then later they would recover the 

1667
01:22:59,551 --> 01:23:00,384
resource in want to reinitiate the hunt.
People have very difficult time with 

1668
01:23:05,171 --> 01:23:06,004
that being like

1669
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:09,160
if it wasn't hunted before,
how can it be hunted now?

1670
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:10,403
Right,
and that trips people up really bad 

1671
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:15,340
where they people have are hard to get 
on board with it.

1672
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,263
If you watch what's going on with 
grizzly bears around what has been 

1673
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:20,164
unfortunately named the greater 
yellowstone ecosystem where you sort of 

1674
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:23,254
have this cultural custody battle around
who owns this Indiana size Hunka land 

1675
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:29,380
surrounding yellowstone where because of
naming,

1676
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:34,210
people sort of think of it as as 
yellowstone when it certainly is not,

1677
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,073
it's a large area surrounding it,
but there we had a period where we 

1678
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:40,650
weren't,
you know,

1679
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:44,620
we stopped grizzly hunting because the 
animals are being over harvested habitat

1680
01:23:44,621 --> 01:23:45,454
destruction and then you go through an 
enormous amount of work to recover the 

1681
01:23:48,491 --> 01:23:49,324
species and people are extremely 
resistant to the idea that you would 

1682
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:56,230
start hunting now that you would now 
start hunting something.

1683
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,060
You weren't hunting a few days ago.
Right.

1684
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,313
That's like.
But it's also what you were saying 

1685
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,173
earlier that it's not recognized as a 
game species because it's thought of 

1686
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,160
something you eat.
Yeah.

1687
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:05,303
Like mountain lions.
Like even if mountain lions are a 

1688
01:24:07,031 --> 01:24:09,390
nuisance,
like there was a woman that had um,

1689
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:14,550
she had a depredation permit because 
mountain lions had killed 10 alpacas and

1690
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:20,461
a goat in her farm in Malibu and she 
decided not to act on the permit because

1691
01:24:21,611 --> 01:24:22,444
there were so many different people that
were threatening her with so many 

1692
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:30,430
wildlife activists that were threatening
her and just general people online death

1693
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:32,580
threats because she,
you know,

1694
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:35,740
she was gonna hire someone to shoot this
mountain lion that had been.

1695
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,580
I mean it just went on a thrill kill and
got into one of our pens,

1696
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:41,240
just went ham,
you know,

1697
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,300
and,
but people,

1698
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:47,440
they think of that thing is somehow or 
another better than her alpacas,

1699
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:48,790
which is very weird.

1700
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,490
No people just recently protested the 
killing of tiger,

1701
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:53,950
a tiger in India that had killed 13 
people.

1702
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:54,813
I saw that.
I put that online and people in the 

1703
01:24:56,321 --> 01:24:59,170
comments where we were like,
fuck those people.

1704
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:01,780
Okay,
you're out of your mind.

1705
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:05,080
What if that was your sister when it was
your daughter?

1706
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,330
When was your mom?
What if is your brother,

1707
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,410
your brother?
Watch,

1708
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:11,350
watch your brother.
Getting dragged away by a giant monster.

1709
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,260
Yeah.
You know,

1710
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,250
just because it's called a tiger.
You're cool with that.

1711
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:15,820
Like,
fuck,

1712
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:19,000
fuck your brother.
Is that what you're saying that this was

1713
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:21,960
an interesting year.
I don't mean that.

1714
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,273
Well,
let me finish my thought and I don't 

1715
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:26,860
want to sound callous when I called.
Interesting,

1716
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:31,861
but Washington state had its first 
mountain lion mortality,

1717
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,033
like where a mountain lion killed a 
human for the first time and I think it 

1718
01:25:34,521 --> 01:25:35,354
was 94 years.
Oregon is when Oregon had its first in 

1719
01:25:37,151 --> 01:25:42,151
state history and I'm with the one in 
Washington killed a person.

1720
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:43,503
They tracked the lying down and killed 
the lion and the state fish and game 

1721
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:48,844
department got predictably like a bunch 
of blowback for having killed and I was 

1722
01:25:52,331 --> 01:25:55,000
talking to someone who was involved with
that and I was standing up.

1723
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:58,990
I think that the blowback would have 
been a lot worse had you not done it.

1724
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:00,220
Yeah.
You know,

1725
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:02,650
but you just don't.
You don't hear from those people,

1726
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:04,130
but there is this.
Would it be blow

1727
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,963
back?
Honestly,

1728
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:06,363
if they didn't kill the lion,
the lion is just out there roaming 

1729
01:26:08,681 --> 01:26:09,514
around.
I think people would just ignore it 

1730
01:26:10,661 --> 01:26:12,550
because the new cycle.
So fucking quick.

1731
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:13,960
Yeah,
I think they would lose.

1732
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:14,794
It would get lost and trump would say 
something stupid about North Korea or 

1733
01:26:16,931 --> 01:26:18,130
whatever and people would forget.

1734
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:19,780
Yeah.
Uh,

1735
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:21,180
I can,
you know,

1736
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:22,810
I continue to,
uh,

1737
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:26,300
you know,
I continued to hunt black bears,

1738
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:28,010
black bears.
It's like,

1739
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,810
you know,
in the case of mountain lions,

1740
01:26:29,811 --> 01:26:32,270
you have a rapidly expanding mountain 
lion populations.

1741
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:33,710
There's a lot of mountain lions,
mountain lions,

1742
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:36,590
or [inaudible] new territory's all the 
time.

1743
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,910
They're managed,
you know,

1744
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:43,210
most states manage them very tightly 
with mortality quotas,

1745
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:47,060
female mortality quarters open season,
close these and permit draws,

1746
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,820
right?
That they're managed as a game animal.

1747
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:51,790
Um,
they're,

1748
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:52,663
they're,
they're hunted and there's some 

1749
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:57,103
allowable use of the renewable resource.
And at the same time that that's going 

1750
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:01,844
on,
we're enjoying expanding populations of 

1751
01:27:03,171 --> 01:27:04,420
mountain lions.
I love,

1752
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:05,283
I personally welcome the return of 
mountain lions to any suitable habitat 

1753
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:11,143
where there's enough space for them to 
live without causing undue friction by 

1754
01:27:17,631 --> 01:27:18,464
them butting up against human interests 
and I encourage people who are in areas 

1755
01:27:21,891 --> 01:27:26,420
that are being caught recolonized by 
mountain lions to practice some level of

1756
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:27,254
tolerance and use best,
best use practices or best case 

1757
01:27:29,421 --> 01:27:33,080
practices around to like avoid conflict.
Right?

1758
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,050
Same thing with bears.
I welcome the return of barriers.

1759
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:38,390
I think there's a lot of areas in this 
country a lot,

1760
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:39,224
but there's a handful of areas in this 
country that could have sustainable 

1761
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:44,653
populations of grizzly bears that psych 
suitable habitat that is not being used 

1762
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:49,850
by grizzly bears and couldn't,
should be used by grizzly bears.

1763
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:54,140
At the same time,
I like to see when it's appropriate.

1764
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:54,974
I like to see state managed wildlife 
practices and then allowable harvest of 

1765
01:27:59,331 --> 01:28:00,164
animals.

1766
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:02,170
There's a lot of people listening to 
this,

1767
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,023
the don't even understand that mountain 
lions are edible and in fact you say 

1768
01:28:06,821 --> 01:28:07,654
delicious.

1769
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:08,903
I liked them.
I was eating mountain lions long before 

1770
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:11,424
I ever hunted mountain.
One hundred one mount line in my life 

1771
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:14,933
and I've eaten a bunch more net.
So I had never had the question about 

1772
01:28:19,081 --> 01:28:19,680
it.
You know,

1773
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,480
I'd never had the question about whether
it was good or not.

1774
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:23,990
Majority of the people listening to this
right now,

1775
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:25,010
I'll probably like what?

1776
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,700
Yeah,
among among Pounds Min,

1777
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,910
like monkey who deal lines is widely 
known that it's a very good meat,

1778
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:32,403
but I was introduced to it that way.
There's a place when I was living in 

1779
01:28:35,531 --> 01:28:37,600
Missoula,
Montana as a place 20 miles east.

1780
01:28:37,601 --> 01:28:40,270
They're called Rock Creek Lodge and 
they're famous for having this big thing

1781
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:45,280
called the testicle festival in the fall
where after you castrate steers,

1782
01:28:45,281 --> 01:28:47,440
you know,
people will fry up the nuts.

1783
01:28:47,441 --> 01:28:48,274
Right.
And so the testicle festivals as big as 

1784
01:28:49,361 --> 01:28:50,194
kind of like turning like this big head 
turned into this kind of bike biker 

1785
01:28:52,451 --> 01:28:54,280
festival,
but it was this,

1786
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:55,693
this big party and it was centered 
around eating deep fried cow balls and 

1787
01:28:59,591 --> 01:29:01,620
we used to go down there all the time 
and go drinking.

1788
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:02,010
And

1789
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,843
one time I was at that same place in the
spring and this guy had a pot of a 

1790
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,330
potluck,
will look like pulled pork,

1791
01:29:09,331 --> 01:29:10,164
you know,
Bart with barbecue sauce and he had a 

1792
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:13,380
bunch of bonds out and he's just giving 
it away.

1793
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,780
And I was eating it and he was telling 
me how it was mountain lion meat and you

1794
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:19,614
were saying you'll is he saying like 
balls in the fall and posting in the 

1795
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:22,750
spring,
you know,

1796
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,583
read mountain land there.
And that was the first time I had 

1797
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:26,184
mountain lion.
And then later I had a girlfriend who's 

1798
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:32,480
from Wyoming and she one day is standing
behind a guy in a.

1799
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:33,833
she's standing behind a guy in a 
hardware store who's buying a mountain 

1800
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,020
land tag.
And she asked him,

1801
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:40,200
what do you do with all that meat?
And he didn't want it.

1802
01:29:40,201 --> 01:29:41,880
So she gave me her phone number.

1803
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:45,570
And then when he got his line he gave us
the whole damn thing.

1804
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,273
And so we ate that whole mountain lion 
than it had when I came into other 

1805
01:29:49,771 --> 01:29:53,880
mountain lion meat in other ways.
And always enjoyed it to the point where

1806
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:58,470
I wasn't eating it because I had a moral
obligation to eat what I killed.

1807
01:29:58,770 --> 01:29:59,603
I was going out of my way to get it 
because I'd rather eat someone else's 

1808
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:05,940
mountain lion than buy pork.
Is Pork,

1809
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,920
is that similar to white meat man?
Wow.

1810
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:11,310
You can take the back straps with fat on
it.

1811
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:15,450
You can leave the fat on it and take 
that back strap and see.

1812
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:16,560
You've got a cookbook.
So they'll have,

1813
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,453
you know,
it's probably going to have trick 

1814
01:30:17,911 --> 01:30:19,470
analysis.
So you got to cook the one six u,

1815
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:19,890
just like,
oh,

1816
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:24,660
just how pork used to be a cook.
It secret the fats good.

1817
01:30:24,661 --> 01:30:26,340
The meat's good.
We Cook it down,

1818
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,070
make all kinds of preparations with the 
cook down.

1819
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:31,770
My kids meet,
they keep a bunch of wild.

1820
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:34,580
They eat a bunch of mountain lion meat,
you know,

1821
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:35,483
well cooked it.
But that's one of those things that 

1822
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:41,310
we're not accustomed to,
but we're.

1823
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:43,590
We're fine with things we are accustomed
to.

1824
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:48,120
If you showed a mountain lion dead on 
social media and you're like,

1825
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:49,290
can't wait to eat this,

1826
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,350
people would go fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1827
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,100
When you saw that recent controversy 
with that woman who shot a goat invasive

1828
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:59,170
species on an island off of Scotland to 
an animal,

1829
01:30:59,171 --> 01:31:01,690
they have to hunt.
They literally have to hunt them if they

1830
01:31:01,691 --> 01:31:02,524
don't.
If you've never seen what a goat can do 

1831
01:31:03,311 --> 01:31:06,310
to an environment,
they just destroy everything.

1832
01:31:06,311 --> 01:31:07,540
They eat everything they can.
They,

1833
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,220
they,
they caused erosion.

1834
01:31:09,221 --> 01:31:09,540
They,
they,

1835
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:10,990
they decimate

1836
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:15,110
all the local foliage.
But they weren't seeing that and I think

1837
01:31:15,111 --> 01:31:18,590
that they were like the people that were
upset about that.

1838
01:31:18,591 --> 01:31:21,290
We're really struggling to describe why 
it upset them.

1839
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:22,333
Even a politician to pointed out that 
the person was wearing camouflage 

1840
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:25,964
because traditionally in Scotland you 
helped with different clothes and there 

1841
01:31:28,251 --> 01:31:30,410
was no secret that there's hunting going
on out there.

1842
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,940
Right?
No secret at all.

1843
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,000
It was that it's an American that she's 
wearing camouflage.

1844
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:40,700
She's adorned,
you know,

1845
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:41,900
like,
like makeup.

1846
01:31:41,901 --> 01:31:44,780
And it was Kinda like a,
like this beautiful image set up.

1847
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:46,203
She had a high powered rifle,
which they're already using out there 

1848
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,153
anyways,
and it was just a confusing idea in a 

1849
01:31:51,291 --> 01:31:52,124
confusing image for people.
Had to been some old Scottish dude with 

1850
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:57,043
his,
with his,

1851
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:58,970
you know,
deerstalker outfit,

1852
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,600
but there's something where people are 
like,

1853
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,270
uh,
why her and why here?

1854
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,650
Yeah.
And it also

1855
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:09,080
her description of it as a fun hunt.
I mean,

1856
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,120
people had a lot of problems with it,
but it's also,

1857
01:32:11,121 --> 01:32:15,650
I think because it's,
there wasn't anything else going on.

1858
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:17,270
She caught a cycle,
you know,

1859
01:32:17,271 --> 01:32:18,170
she,
she just got,

1860
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:19,773
you know,
she was headed down the river and a 

1861
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:24,920
tributary opened up and she went right 
into controversy bank.

1862
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,833
Yeah,
that's what I think happened in the 

1863
01:32:26,631 --> 01:32:27,464
people that were tweeting about.
I saw Glenn Glenn Greenwald tweet about 

1864
01:32:30,861 --> 01:32:31,641
it.
I'm like,

1865
01:32:31,641 --> 01:32:32,474
you're a journalist,
like you're an actual journalist to 

1866
01:32:34,791 --> 01:32:35,624
respected journalist.
You should really do some research on 

1867
01:32:37,641 --> 01:32:40,880
this because the way you're calling it,
I don't know.

1868
01:32:40,881 --> 01:32:42,650
I mean,
Glenn Greenwald is a,

1869
01:32:42,651 --> 01:32:45,050
I believe he's some sort of an animal 
rights activist.

1870
01:32:45,051 --> 01:32:48,080
I don't know if he's a Vegan.
I don't know if he's a vegetarian,

1871
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:51,080
but I know Ricky Gervais' isn't.
He's not a vegetarian.

1872
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:52,460
He's no.

1873
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,050
Oh really?
Yes.

1874
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:55,790
That's the weird part,
right?

1875
01:32:55,791 --> 01:32:57,350
Yeah.
That's funny man.

1876
01:32:57,351 --> 01:32:58,580
That I didn't know that.
I didn't know

1877
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:02,240
the on a radio show about it.
He needs me.

1878
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,133
Yes.
We were talking about hunting and you 

1879
01:33:06,431 --> 01:33:07,264
know,
I brought it up because we were on the 

1880
01:33:07,941 --> 01:33:10,130
radio show together on the opiod anthony
show and I said,

1881
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,193
I shot bears and I eat them.
I eat everything I kill and I hunt for 

1882
01:33:15,981 --> 01:33:16,814
food and I prefer to get meat that way.
And we discussed the fact that he eats 

1883
01:33:20,781 --> 01:33:21,614
meat.

1884
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:23,573
Huh?

1885
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:25,590
It's a weird one,
right?

1886
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:26,843
Because it's A.
There's a virtue signaling aspect of 

1887
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:35,430
shitting on hunters where you're always 
going to get some positive remarks about

1888
01:33:35,431 --> 01:33:35,840
it.

1889
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,010
It's,
it's difficult for me.

1890
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:42,210
It's not difficult for me for from 
someone who doesn't.

1891
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,720
Who doesn't eat meat,
right.

1892
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,753
I,
I can,

1893
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,480
I don't have any.
I don't have a problem with it.

1894
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,640
Like I'm like,
you know,

1895
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:51,150
I,
my brother said a bass like,

1896
01:33:51,151 --> 01:33:51,984
I don't know.
He said maybe they have a point when 

1897
01:33:55,241 --> 01:33:56,074
it's coming,
someone who doesn't mean it winds up 

1898
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:57,923
demonstrate that they're trying to put 
them to condemn hunters who are hunting 

1899
01:34:01,831 --> 01:34:04,550
like a regulated resource.
Yeah.

1900
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:05,880
Chicken Dem,
them.

1901
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,420
You're sort of acting like when you 
condemn you sort of acting like,

1902
01:34:09,421 --> 01:34:10,254
oh,
I care about these issues and I want to 

1903
01:34:11,851 --> 01:34:14,670
be out here and I want to be like 
articulating a perspective and,

1904
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:15,623
and I know what's going on,
but then you're like putting yourself 

1905
01:34:18,781 --> 01:34:20,730
out as a person who has opinions of 
value,

1906
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:21,560
right?
Just,

1907
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,160
just to like let your opinion be known.

1908
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:24,533
So if you're going to have that,
like where's the self examination 

1909
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:31,830
exactly where you are.
If you're eating meat,

1910
01:34:31,831 --> 01:34:34,290
like you're contributing all kinds of 
animal death.

1911
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:39,000
Like what is your understanding of what 
is your understanding of those lives and

1912
01:34:39,001 --> 01:34:42,090
those deaths?
How is that not part of your reckoning?

1913
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:43,463
If I do,
let's say I am happy that I got a bear 

1914
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:50,970
that I will eat with my family.
Let's say I am happy about it.

1915
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:52,403
Um,
is it better for you that you're kind 

1916
01:34:55,141 --> 01:34:57,000
of,
is it better to be sad about it somehow?

1917
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:57,853
Is it better to be regretful or just 
ignore the fact altogether or why is it 

1918
01:35:00,681 --> 01:35:02,810
not okay that I'm happy about what I 
eat?

1919
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:04,663
I know the story of it really well.
Like I understand the history of 

1920
01:35:08,961 --> 01:35:09,794
wildlife in this country.
I don't want to say better than anybody 

1921
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:13,250
but damn sure better than most.

1922
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:18,230
I know where we've been.
I have a good sense of where we're going

1923
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:19,123
in terms of American wildlife,
what the challenges are for American 

1924
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:22,753
Wildlife,
right?

1925
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,070
I'm involved in this stuff on a daily 
basis.

1926
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:28,280
I can know all that and I can see my 
place in it,

1927
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,223
right?
I can see what my actions are and 

1928
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,793
whether my actions are helpful or 
hurtful for something that I care a 

1929
01:35:36,651 --> 01:35:41,651
great deal about and if I can know that 
well and get a deer,

1930
01:35:43,311 --> 01:35:44,144
a bear or whatever and have it be food 
and find that I'm like really happy to 

1931
01:35:47,121 --> 01:35:50,480
be involved in that.
That somehow is off putting to people,

1932
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:53,600
but it's okay to be that.
It's I'm blind to it,

1933
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,590
I have this nagging sense of guilt about
it that I haven't reckoned with.

1934
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,800
I don't really know about it,
you know,

1935
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:01,693
and that's like,
that's like an accessible position for 

1936
01:36:02,991 --> 01:36:03,824
some people to have.

1937
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,350
It's really hard for me with people that
are,

1938
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,350
that are contributing to animal death,
who,

1939
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:14,120
who want to condemn those who are more 
willing to or for whatever reason,

1940
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:17,690
willing to excited about taking part in 
the process themselves.

1941
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,200
I got to find a way to.
I gotta find a way to,

1942
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,093
to,
to engage with it though and I need to 

1943
01:36:23,481 --> 01:36:25,250
get a better understanding of it because
the,

1944
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:27,020
the,
the debate isn't going away.

1945
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:27,973
I can't keep brushing it off is so 
ridiculous that it doesn't warrant my 

1946
01:36:30,531 --> 01:36:34,490
time because clearly it does warrant my 
time to understand that perspective.

1947
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:35,383
I just haven't had anybody really give 
to me in a good way to I have to say 

1948
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:38,211
like,
oh,

1949
01:36:38,211 --> 01:36:39,590
but they were raised to be eaten.

1950
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:44,400
That's a foolish perspective to me is 
way,

1951
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:46,530
way worse.
So life condemned.

1952
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,400
I'd rather talk to Google of Glenn 
Greenwald is a Vegan.

1953
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:54,090
I'd probably rather talk to someone like
Ricky Gervais' about it because I.

1954
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:56,760
I assume that he's articulate about it 
and he's articulate.

1955
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:59,700
I don't think his position is a nuanced.
I don't.

1956
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:00,563
I don't.
I think there's some willful ignorance 

1957
01:37:01,771 --> 01:37:02,604
that's a part of people that eat meat,
but condemn hunting a willful and the 

1958
01:37:06,601 --> 01:37:07,740
fact that,
like I said,

1959
01:37:07,741 --> 01:37:10,530
they know that they're going to get a 
certain reaction out of people when they

1960
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,650
tweet about it on social media.
One thing,

1961
01:37:13,651 --> 01:37:16,440
if you're talking about someone who out 
there shooting things and not eating it,

1962
01:37:16,441 --> 01:37:17,460
okay,
I get it.

1963
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,890
I'm with you.
We'll see if some guy's just shooting an

1964
01:37:19,891 --> 01:37:22,320
elephant because he wants his tusks.
I'm on your side.

1965
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:25,860
I get it,
but if someone chooses to hunt,

1966
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:28,290
you know,
and an animal fill in the blank.

1967
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,153
That might be a goat,
might be weird to you that they're 

1968
01:37:32,161 --> 01:37:34,530
eating this thing,
but they're shooting this.

1969
01:37:34,531 --> 01:37:37,620
It's an invasive species.
It's actually very delicious.

1970
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:41,250
It's very edible.
Prized for its meat by some communities.

1971
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:42,823
You don't make any sense you're doing 
this because you know that other people 

1972
01:37:45,241 --> 01:37:46,074
are ignorant about it as well,
and either you're ignorant because 

1973
01:37:47,911 --> 01:37:48,744
you've never bothered to look into it or
you've bothered to look into it and 

1974
01:37:51,271 --> 01:37:52,560
you're ignoring the nuance.

1975
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,370
Yeah.
In the case of the goat thing,

1976
01:37:54,371 --> 01:37:56,160
there's a little added thing.
There's an added

1977
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:00,870
element that our government on the 
federal level is involved.

1978
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:04,470
There's a lot of state wildlife 
management agencies that are involved in

1979
01:38:04,471 --> 01:38:09,471
trying to do a wild goat eradication 
projects on islands.

1980
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:12,750
Yes.
This is something that's ongoing all the

1981
01:38:12,751 --> 01:38:15,860
time in Hawaii.
In many other places where were were.

1982
01:38:15,861 --> 01:38:20,861
We're like out helicopter gunning 
helicopter gunning for invasive species.

1983
01:38:22,561 --> 01:38:25,410
Explain to people how those goats got 
there and the first race,

1984
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:28,130
because this is also very weird,
um,

1985
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:31,990
a variety of ways,
but a lot of things were a lot of island

1986
01:38:31,991 --> 01:38:32,824
species.
This is one way it happens where 

1987
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:39,990
invasive on islands would be introduced 
by seafarers,

1988
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,273
whalers who would want to establish food
resources along transoceanic routes so 

1989
01:38:50,071 --> 01:38:52,170
that you could put something there and 
come back and get it later,

1990
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:55,590
early way like way.
He used to come out of the the,

1991
01:38:55,591 --> 01:38:56,424
the American Ne,
like all those famous whaling villages 

1992
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,020
in New England,
you know,

1993
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:06,150
they would go down and stop in and stop 
in and the Galapagos,

1994
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,700
whatever,
gather up tortoises that they could flip

1995
01:39:08,701 --> 01:39:12,120
over in the whole of a boat and the 
tourists to stay alive for months on its

1996
01:39:12,121 --> 01:39:12,810
back.

1997
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:13,643
You'd have like a fresh meat resource 
and as people came to understand scurvy 

1998
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:19,343
and realizing that fresh meat gives you 
enough vitamin C to avoid scurvy that 

1999
01:39:25,891 --> 01:39:26,724
you can get from dried meat because the 
way the vitamin C behaves through the 

2000
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:31,770
cooking and drawing process,
but like fresh meat,

2001
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:32,604
you can keep them.
Having scurvy me became even more 

2002
01:39:34,441 --> 01:39:35,274
important than.
But people would come in and cut some 

2003
01:39:37,201 --> 01:39:38,021
sheep,
loose cuts,

2004
01:39:38,021 --> 01:39:42,150
some bolts loose on an island and know 
that they're going to breed and build up

2005
01:39:42,151 --> 01:39:43,950
a big population and that can be like a 
place.

2006
01:39:43,951 --> 01:39:48,780
You stop in and get food and other 
things get introduced in other ways.

2007
01:39:48,781 --> 01:39:50,370
And of course animals move,
you know,

2008
01:39:50,371 --> 01:39:51,204
so you have one island has close 
proximity to another island they can 

2009
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:54,900
swim across.
Yeah.

2010
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,380
Bump over and it destroys native 
vegetation.

2011
01:39:58,620 --> 01:39:59,453
They trampled bird's nests and so you 
have many cases where introductions of 

2012
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:08,520
non natives,
particularly non native grazing animals,

2013
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,413
non native predators will wind up 
causing like a lot of extinctions of 

2014
01:40:13,081 --> 01:40:15,480
endemic species on islands and creates 
all kinds of problems

2015
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,770
and that's exactly what we're talking 
about with this.

2016
01:40:17,771 --> 01:40:21,250
Go in that picture.
So this is an animal that must be killed

2017
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:24,220
if you want healthy wildlife on that 
island,

2018
01:40:24,221 --> 01:40:26,740
the native wildlife and the native 
fauna,

2019
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,740
the flora,
all this stuff that lives there.

2020
01:40:29,741 --> 01:40:31,150
All this stuff that's supposed to be 
there.

2021
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:33,670
You got to kill the goats.
Otherwise they'll eat everything.

2022
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,580
But I think people look,
people look and they,

2023
01:40:36,581 --> 01:40:37,091
they,
they,

2024
01:40:37,091 --> 01:40:37,590
they,
they,

2025
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:39,770
they look and they're like,
I don't buy that.

2026
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,633
That was the motivation of that person.
What I care about his motivations of 

2027
01:40:43,941 --> 01:40:44,774
individuals.
I think you're right because when 

2028
01:40:46,071 --> 01:40:48,500
California got rid of mountain lion 
hunting,

2029
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:51,980
they're still killing several hundred 
mountain lions here a year.

2030
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:54,280
People are comfortable,
like the total

2031
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:59,280
lion kill didn't change much.
People are comfortable with estate agent

2032
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:04,360
or someone being paid to go out and kill
lines.

2033
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:07,360
They're not comfortable with some pain.
Who wants to go

2034
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:09,520
do it?
I don't think they realize.

2035
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:10,383
I don't think they realize that state 
agencies are killing as many mountain 

2036
01:41:12,221 --> 01:41:15,490
lions in California as they are.
I don't think people understand that.

2037
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:19,510
I think people do understand.
If something gets put on the ballot,

2038
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,850
would you like to reintroduce mountain 
lion hunting?

2039
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:24,190
People would go crazy.
Like why would you do that?

2040
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:26,230
Mountain lions are beautiful.
They're exciting.

2041
01:41:26,231 --> 01:41:29,380
I want to see them,
but these are people in Santa Monica,

2042
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:32,170
you know what I'm saying?
They're not people that are living,

2043
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:33,403
you know,
an hour outside of Bakersfield and they 

2044
01:41:35,451 --> 01:41:38,110
got 16 mountain lions in their backyard 
and a year.

2045
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:40,490
That's a different kind of world.
You know,

2046
01:41:40,491 --> 01:41:44,620
if they're in the tach p mountains out 
there and you see mountain lions all the

2047
01:41:44,621 --> 01:41:46,810
time.
They have a lot of mountain lions.

2048
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:47,860
Yeah.
And the real issue,

2049
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:53,010
and there was a problem too that I view 
this is coming from there's a problem or

2050
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:55,173
I think a lot of people have a very hard
time empathizing with people who might 

2051
01:42:01,121 --> 01:42:01,954
be negatively impacted by wildlife as 
well in the question of the lion issue 

2052
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:09,760
where it's kind of like this idea like,
well you better suck it up,

2053
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:11,263
right?
Yeah.

2054
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:14,440
So if you're a rancher and you're 
running cattle and the area where you're

2055
01:42:14,441 --> 01:42:18,820
losing a lot of cattle,
the walls and grizzlies people will look

2056
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:20,620
and be like,
you better suck it up,

2057
01:42:20,621 --> 01:42:21,454
buddy.
Like I can't really picture your 

2058
01:42:23,621 --> 01:42:26,980
problem,
but your complaints are not legitimate.

2059
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:29,140
Well they can't.
If someone were to cut a.

2060
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:32,410
If someone were to cut a grizzly Lewis 
and golden gate state part,

2061
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,350
right.
I don't know.

2062
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:37,840
Um,
I think that people would have,

2063
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:42,670
would come to have a different 
perspective on that to put it mildly.

2064
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:44,530
Yeah.
But it winds up being the.

2065
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:45,403
You look and people are,
they don't really want to hear about 

2066
01:42:47,921 --> 01:42:48,754
other people's problems if it doesn't,
if it doesn't jive with their 

2067
01:42:50,981 --> 01:42:51,814
understanding of what problems are.
And that's the area where the issue 

2068
01:42:54,971 --> 01:42:58,620
around grizzly bears and the delisting,
so you know,

2069
01:42:58,621 --> 01:42:59,454
they were delisted,
they were removed from the endangered 

2070
01:43:00,731 --> 01:43:04,750
species act protection temporarily 
because they had,

2071
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:05,913
had met all recovery goals.
So when we look mostly recovered 

2072
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:09,603
population look like they mapped out 
what it would look like and we've 

2073
01:43:11,951 --> 01:43:14,830
exceeded that for many years now.
And they were delisted,

2074
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:19,540
but then a Wyoming and Idaho moved to 
have a very limited hunt on them.

2075
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,153
Um,
and then they were a federal judge 

2076
01:43:23,351 --> 01:43:24,184
blocked the listing and they went back 
and listing it was the federal judges 

2077
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:29,920
motivation.
Well,

2078
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:32,380
you want to hope that,
uh,

2079
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:34,183
that they didn't have one you want,
you want to think that they were just 

2080
01:43:36,551 --> 01:43:37,740
looking at,
you know,

2081
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:38,613
the details of it.
But I think there's a suspicion that 

2082
01:43:40,841 --> 01:43:45,520
that person went into that knowing damn 
sure what they were gonna do,

2083
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:47,540
you know?
Uh,

2084
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:52,040
but you don't really know a lot of these
arguments around.

2085
01:43:52,041 --> 01:43:54,380
They'd come down to like technicalities,
right?

2086
01:43:54,650 --> 01:43:56,860
No one's arguing that the populations 
recovering

2087
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:59,930
well.
There's also the argument that the judge

2088
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:00,764
is probably trying to protect his own 
reputation because the amount of blow 

2089
01:44:03,121 --> 01:44:03,954
back that a judge would receive for 
allowing a hunt to go through is vastly 

2090
01:44:08,091 --> 01:44:10,110
different than blocking a hunt.
You know,

2091
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:10,941
blocking.
You Hunt,

2092
01:44:10,941 --> 01:44:12,350
you're not gonna get that much blow 
back.

2093
01:44:12,351 --> 01:44:13,184
You'll get a few people that are upset,
but it hadn't been an established 

2094
01:44:15,141 --> 01:44:15,974
resource.
Not only you're taking something away 

2095
01:44:16,731 --> 01:44:20,240
from people,
but if he allowed it pour the wildlife.

2096
01:44:20,241 --> 01:44:21,920
People would go fucking bananas on this 
guy.

2097
01:44:22,030 --> 01:44:22,571
Yeah.
They,

2098
01:44:22,571 --> 01:44:23,404
they tend to like,
and I don't even call them and like I 

2099
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:26,174
don't call them environmentalists,
people who sued to block the delisting 

2100
01:44:29,981 --> 01:44:34,981
of recovering species,
the masquerade as ecologically conscious

2101
01:44:36,611 --> 01:44:39,400
environmentalist,
but they're just people who it's,

2102
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:42,220
it's untenable to them.
They can't,

2103
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,393
they're never going to accept the idea 
that you're going to have human 

2104
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,860
exploitation of this resource.
Right.

2105
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:48,733
Did they masquerade that they're.
They have an environmental motivation 

2106
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:51,534
was not.
It's like it's an animal rights 

2107
01:44:52,181 --> 01:44:55,780
motivation.
There's a very,

2108
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:56,883
there's a,
they have a sensitive ear in a certain 

2109
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,290
federal court,
you know,

2110
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:02,163
in Missoula,
and so you'll see a lot of these cases 

2111
01:45:03,341 --> 01:45:05,440
around wolves and grizzlies.
They'll get that.

2112
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:10,210
They want it done through that court.
They know their going to have a friendly

2113
01:45:10,211 --> 01:45:11,650
take on it.
I think it was a real.

2114
01:45:11,651 --> 01:45:14,110
It was watching that happen and that's 
been happening recently.

2115
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:19,110
I think it was a real,
a real travesty because there's a couple

2116
01:45:19,511 --> 01:45:23,950
of things that happen like culturally an
areas where you'll.

2117
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:25,373
You create a lot of tension with people 
where there's people that are living 

2118
01:45:29,321 --> 01:45:30,154
amongst these things and they're looking
for some level of some level of relief 

2119
01:45:34,721 --> 01:45:35,554
and they want to see it go to state 
management and they might want to see 

2120
01:45:38,021 --> 01:45:38,854
the state exercise.
Some control over where certain 

2121
01:45:41,441 --> 01:45:42,274
populations of large predators are 
spreading into and when it winds up 

2122
01:45:45,461 --> 01:45:47,590
being that they're like,
their voices are not heard,

2123
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:48,903
you know,
and they feel that people from far away 

2124
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,130
are really heavily influencing decisions
that affect them on a daily basis.

2125
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:55,173
It winds up creating a lot of animosity 
toward the species to where they think 

2126
01:45:58,991 --> 01:46:00,430
about what happened with the spotted 
owl,

2127
01:46:00,431 --> 01:46:01,990
right?
The spotted owl.

2128
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:04,610
No one can see.
No one perceives the spotted owl,

2129
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:05,493
an owl anymore.
The spotted owl is become like a symbol 

2130
01:46:07,751 --> 01:46:08,584
of federal overreach and you'll find 
that you know wolves for awhile they 

2131
01:46:13,330 --> 01:46:14,163
become like a symbol of a dispute and 
people stopped liking the animals much 

2132
01:46:18,851 --> 01:46:22,570
and it becomes like this contentious 
creature and I think that we're going to

2133
01:46:22,571 --> 01:46:23,404
head that way if we keep,
if we keep stepping in on wildlife 

2134
01:46:26,681 --> 01:46:27,514
issues with the mentality that we've 
been approaching the wool from grizzly 

2135
01:46:30,311 --> 01:46:33,670
issue in the northern Great Lakes,
the northern rockies,

2136
01:46:33,671 --> 01:46:36,070
soon to be in the greater yellowstone 
ecosystem.

2137
01:46:36,071 --> 01:46:38,010
Now I think you're dealing with low

2138
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:39,860
cool,
and then you're dealing with national,

2139
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,960
right?
So the local people are going to have an

2140
01:46:41,961 --> 01:46:44,120
issue with it because they're going to 
be impacted by it.

2141
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,370
It's going to be directly impacting 
their life.

2142
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:49,920
Dogs are going to be killed while 
they're gonna

2143
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:53,330
take domestic cattle and all sorts of 
different things.

2144
01:46:53,331 --> 01:46:56,900
You've got to have real issues with the 
people that liked to go elk hunting.

2145
01:46:56,901 --> 01:47:01,550
The populations have diminished rapidly,
but the rest of the country doesn't give

2146
01:47:01,551 --> 01:47:03,500
a shit.
People in San Francisco,

2147
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:07,640
they don't give a fuck about it.
People in Chicago aren't impacted by it,

2148
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:09,163
especially if they don't have anyone in 
their family that haunts or anyone that 

2149
01:47:12,021 --> 01:47:12,854
has a background in hunting and they 
don't have a background in it 

2150
01:47:14,361 --> 01:47:16,010
themselves.
They don't care.

2151
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,310
No.
People really don't.

2152
01:47:17,311 --> 01:47:18,050
And it's,
I,

2153
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:19,350
I pointed out all the time,
but,

2154
01:47:20,110 --> 01:47:20,943
um,

2155
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:27,000
that I care about the availability and 
been an abundance of deer,

2156
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:30,070
elk,
Moose,

2157
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:31,750
Caribou,
right?

2158
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:32,980
Like,
I care about the resource.

2159
01:47:32,981 --> 01:47:35,740
There's a lot of people who rely on the 
resource,

2160
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:38,710
use the resource there,
major economic drivers.

2161
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:40,060
Um,
I'm definitely,

2162
01:47:40,061 --> 01:47:41,660
I'm anything but I'm like,
I,

2163
01:47:41,661 --> 01:47:46,090
I regard myself as a pro wolf person.
I regard myself as a pro grizzly person.

2164
01:47:46,091 --> 01:47:49,180
I cherish every interaction I have with 
those animals.

2165
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:51,580
Do you think to be around a number of 
resource.

2166
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:54,310
I don't have a problem with common 
resource to people,

2167
01:47:54,311 --> 01:47:56,860
but people do have a problem with 
calling resource and um,

2168
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:57,880
and,
and yeah,

2169
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:59,400
I'm like pro.
I'd like to,

2170
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:01,840
in suitable habitat,
I like to see them present.

2171
01:48:01,841 --> 01:48:02,674
I also like to see that,
that I also like to see them managing 

2172
01:48:06,191 --> 01:48:09,220
the way that allows for a bond and wild 
game resources.

2173
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:11,013
What's going on?
House passed the bill to drop legal 

2174
01:48:13,091 --> 01:48:15,550
protections for gray wolves as past 
today,

2175
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:19,780
or will this interesting was two hours 
ago,

2176
01:48:19,781 --> 01:48:21,430
so well roll down a little bit.

2177
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:28,600
Republican controlled House passed a 
bill on Friday to drop legal protections

2178
01:48:28,601 --> 01:48:29,434
or gray wolves across the lower 48 
states reopening a lengthy battle over 

2179
01:48:32,261 --> 01:48:35,590
the Predator species,
long despised by farmers and ranchers.

2180
01:48:35,591 --> 01:48:36,670
Wolves were shot,
trap,

2181
01:48:36,671 --> 01:48:39,790
poisoned out of existence,
and most of the u s in the Mid Twentieth

2182
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:40,623
Century by the Mid Twentieth Century.
Since securing protection in the 19 

2183
01:48:43,151 --> 01:48:44,650
seventies,
wolves have bounced back.

2184
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,270
Well,
it's not really excited what happened.

2185
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:47,493
Great Lakes of Michigan,
Minnesota and Wisconsin as well in the 

2186
01:48:49,691 --> 01:48:52,380
northern rockies and Pacific northwest.
That's SORTA,

2187
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:54,310
but they're not talking about the 
reintroduction.

2188
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:55,900
Reintroduction is the big issue.
Right.

2189
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:56,793
Well,
and that's what people have great issue 

2190
01:48:58,451 --> 01:48:59,284
with.

2191
01:48:59,400 --> 01:48:59,760
Well,
the other,

2192
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,010
the reintroduction is only in one area.
The Great Lake,

2193
01:49:02,011 --> 01:49:04,710
the northern Great Lakes.
That was not a reintroduction.

2194
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:05,573
There was a sizable population.
I will movements of wolves coming down 

2195
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:11,420
from Canada and coming back in the 
northern Ca,

2196
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:15,000
the court,
northern continental divide ecosystem.

2197
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:18,330
Not a reintroduction famous.
Yeah.

2198
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:19,120
Well,
yeah.

2199
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:20,950
The famous case of the famous 
reintroduction,

2200
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:23,700
Yellowstone National Park,
so viewed now.

2201
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:27,000
It's widely viewed now that if you 
wouldn't have done that,

2202
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:29,430
you would have had had you not done that
reintroduction,

2203
01:49:29,431 --> 01:49:33,180
you'd have had a natural flow anyway.
A natural flow from Canada.

2204
01:49:33,210 --> 01:49:34,260
You would have got it.
You would have,

2205
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,470
you would have eventually you would 
eventually have gotten there anyway.

2206
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:38,483
Interesting.
But would they have gotten to the exact 

2207
01:49:39,931 --> 01:49:40,950
same levels?
No,

2208
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:41,933
no.
At this particular point right now as I 

2209
01:49:44,401 --> 01:49:47,010
think that'd be like laughable to act as
though they'd be there now,

2210
01:49:47,150 --> 01:49:47,681
I think,
but,

2211
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:48,280
but people.

2212
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:52,570
There's no realization that you would 
have that without the reintroduction you

2213
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:54,010
would've,
through natural movement,

2214
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:56,480
have eventually gotten,
you know,

2215
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:57,720
do you.

2216
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:59,080
I think that that's,
uh,

2217
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:00,013
that the,
that supports the idea of the 

2218
01:50:01,801 --> 01:50:02,634
reintroduction.
You think the introduction was well 

2219
01:50:04,201 --> 01:50:05,034
thought out.

2220
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:06,371
I don't want it,
you know,

2221
01:50:06,371 --> 01:50:08,140
I'm not going to debate the merits of 
the reintroduction.

2222
01:50:08,141 --> 01:50:10,300
Like I said,
my perspective on it.

2223
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:12,940
It should be in a place where it 
supports them.

2224
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,430
Yeah.
My perspective on it is I,

2225
01:50:14,431 --> 01:50:15,790
I don't,
uh,

2226
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:20,650
the idea of extinction and regional 
extirpation sickens me,

2227
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:26,130
I do not believe in.
I do not believe that like as a people,

2228
01:50:28,121 --> 01:50:28,954
as a culture,
we can justify or afford to remove 

2229
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:37,960
species of wildlife from the landscape.
Um,

2230
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:39,970
native species of wild there from the 
landscape.

2231
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:42,850
Like I said,
the idea of sickens me,

2232
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:44,580
I like to,
you know,

2233
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:49,620
I like to have all native wildlife 
present on the landscape so

2234
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:58,380
I don't oppose it.
What I oppose is a thing that's happened

2235
01:50:58,381 --> 01:50:59,214
now is getting where we have populations
that we agree like what will recovery 

2236
01:51:05,011 --> 01:51:05,844
look like and at what point when,
how will we manage all the different 

2237
01:51:08,881 --> 01:51:12,330
viewpoints that are coming in,
all the different interests of all these

2238
01:51:12,331 --> 01:51:15,180
varied stakeholders.
Net what point where we get in there and

2239
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:17,610
manipulate the situation that we're 
creating.

2240
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,313
I just would move that in a different 
direction where I think that when that 

2241
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:25,800
recovered species,
right in this case,

2242
01:51:25,830 --> 01:51:27,240
when we're talking about walls and 
grizzlies,

2243
01:51:27,570 --> 01:51:28,403
I think that you should have that.
If you can do it in a sustainable way 

2244
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:32,303
that doesn't have longterm deleterious 
impacts on the population that they 

2245
01:51:34,891 --> 01:51:36,360
should be managed as a renewable 
resource.

2246
01:51:37,370 --> 01:51:38,203
See,
this is where people are going to have 

2247
01:51:38,661 --> 01:51:39,740
issues.
I don't have any.

2248
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:45,160
Just even the term manage them as a 
renewable resource.

2249
01:51:45,590 --> 01:51:47,240
You mean shoot them and kill them and 
use their.

2250
01:51:47,241 --> 01:51:48,074
For

2251
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:49,923
sure.
I think that,

2252
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:50,773
I think that recovered bcs that I think 
that if you put something on the 

2253
01:51:52,931 --> 01:51:55,510
endangered species act and it goes under
federal protection,

2254
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:56,983
um,
and then when it reaches recovery and 

2255
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:02,110
the US fish and wildlife service as it's
recovered,

2256
01:52:02,111 --> 01:52:04,270
it's time to hand it back to state 
management.

2257
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:07,600
If a state then decides that they're 
going to do some limited harvest,

2258
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:08,733
particularly let's say they're,
even if they're focusing on areas where 

2259
01:52:10,691 --> 01:52:11,524
there's like very high prevalence of 
human animal conflict and the state 

2260
01:52:14,771 --> 01:52:15,604
decides to do that in some like minor 
way as a way to service the needs of 

2261
01:52:22,121 --> 01:52:24,730
certain segments of their population 
that wants something to happen.

2262
01:52:24,910 --> 01:52:25,743
I don't think that then some like an 
activist judge or or environmental 

2263
01:52:31,421 --> 01:52:33,520
groups or animal rights groups should 
come and be like,

2264
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:34,383
well nevermind.
We're going to pretend that they're not 

2265
01:52:35,231 --> 01:52:36,064
recovered now because we want to prevent
the state from doing something that we 

2266
01:52:38,261 --> 01:52:39,190
think is unsavory.

2267
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:40,903
Well,
the thought process behind the people 

2268
01:52:42,111 --> 01:52:46,130
that support blocking the hunt is that 
if you leave these

2269
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:46,963
animals alone,
naturally they're going to find balance 

2270
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:54,500
and that the wolves will kill the elk.
Until there's not enough elk for them to

2271
01:52:54,501 --> 01:52:55,334
sustain their populations and the 
numbers of their offspring will dwindle 

2272
01:52:58,190 --> 01:53:00,560
and they'll get to some sort of a 
sustainable level.

2273
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:01,460
Yeah,
but we already.

2274
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,410
I mean,
we live in a.

2275
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:07,570
We live in a heavily manipulated kind of
land kind of manmade environment.

2276
01:53:07,571 --> 01:53:08,404
Now the idea that things are gonna,
we would just let things run their 

2277
01:53:12,581 --> 01:53:15,760
course and watch what happens isn't 
going to happen.

2278
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:19,060
You're still going to have a lot of 
grizzlies.

2279
01:53:19,061 --> 01:53:21,340
Every year are still going to get in 
trouble.

2280
01:53:21,490 --> 01:53:24,010
They're still going to get killed.
You're still going to have mortality.

2281
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,980
You know you're going to have tons of 
grizzy mortality in tough areas,

2282
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:30,240
but they're going to kill.
These are enacting and packs.

2283
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:32,980
That's how they kill.
They kill cattle and they come up.

2284
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:34,780
They brought up against humans.
It's just like,

2285
01:53:34,781 --> 01:53:35,614
it's inevitable.
You're gonna.

2286
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:38,610
Have some that you're not going to let 
it run as a.

2287
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:40,060
As a person,
as a hunter.

2288
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,313
I also don't have a problem with and 
actually support as a hunter that we 

2289
01:53:45,461 --> 01:53:49,900
would all while allowing wolves to be 
present on the landscape,

2290
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:53,980
that we would mitigate their impact on 
big game.

2291
01:53:53,981 --> 01:53:54,814
I don't mind saying,
I don't mind just coming out and saying 

2292
01:53:56,591 --> 01:53:57,424
that I like to have high populations of 
big game animals that are available to 

2293
01:54:01,421 --> 01:54:06,421
hunters and also at the same time 
sharing some of that resource there.

2294
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:10,810
Having wolves on the ground doing it.
I don't want to see them gone.

2295
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,420
Not Anti Wolf,
not anti grizzly.

2296
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:13,613
It's just one of those war.
It's because of wolf is so much like a 

2297
01:54:17,221 --> 01:54:20,850
dog and because there's not a great 
history of people eating.

2298
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:22,770
I remember you telling me about one 
mountain men were.

2299
01:54:22,771 --> 01:54:26,880
His favorite food was wolf.
Stefansson is the Arctic explorer.

2300
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,080
What a crazy fucker.
That guy must've loved wolf meet.

2301
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:33,160
You ever tried it?
No.

2302
01:54:33,310 --> 01:54:34,080
No,
no.

2303
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,070
Levy in coyote.

2304
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:36,043
You Eaten Caio.
So you've eaten that species and I've 

2305
01:54:37,710 --> 01:54:39,090
never.
I've never killed a wolf.

2306
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:41,760
Never killed a grizzly bear.
Just haven't.

2307
01:54:41,761 --> 01:54:45,480
Haven't eaten either of them.
I won coyote.

2308
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:47,880
Yeah.
Didn't aid it.

2309
01:54:47,881 --> 01:54:50,340
Didn't like it.
Haven't messed with one sense.

2310
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:55,210
Yeah.
You said that was similar to divert duct

2311
01:54:55,211 --> 01:54:56,010
to.
Right.

2312
01:54:56,010 --> 01:54:58,530
That was Ramey.
Ramey felt that it tastes like bad.

2313
01:54:58,531 --> 01:55:01,440
Diver duck diver ducks and still eat 
diver ducks.

2314
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:02,521
But no,
I haven't.

2315
01:55:02,521 --> 01:55:03,354
No,
I haven't,

2316
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:05,010
uh,
haven't done that anymore.

2317
01:55:05,011 --> 01:55:05,844
And then,
um,

2318
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:06,813
haven't included any coyote recipes in.
There was no coyote recipes in the wild 

2319
01:55:09,751 --> 01:55:10,584
game cookbook either wolf might be the 
ultimate one that people are going to 

2320
01:55:12,981 --> 01:55:13,814
have a problem with at the very.
That might be where the rubber hits the 

2321
01:55:16,351 --> 01:55:17,101
road.
Well,

2322
01:55:17,101 --> 01:55:17,934
you know,
in some places become a moot point 

2323
01:55:20,431 --> 01:55:23,220
because Idaho,
Wyoming,

2324
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:27,800
Montana,
I'm all have state management of Walt's.

2325
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:29,520
Yeah.
All of the things that we're.

2326
01:55:29,521 --> 01:55:30,354
All these horrible things that were 
going to happen when the state's resume 

2327
01:55:32,701 --> 01:55:35,580
management of wolves didn't materialize.
Right.

2328
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:38,280
But those places also have a rich 
history of hunting.

2329
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:40,580
Yeah.
But it was,

2330
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,270
it was going to be the end of wolves.
Right.

2331
01:55:42,570 --> 01:55:44,040
It hasn't in the first few

2332
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,873
years,
in the first few years of the wool 

2333
01:55:45,931 --> 01:55:46,890
seasons,
he actually had.

2334
01:55:46,930 --> 01:55:50,340
He actually saw the populations go up so
hard to hunt them.

2335
01:55:50,341 --> 01:55:51,174
Right?
Well,

2336
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:53,700
it winds up being the,
uh,

2337
01:55:54,330 --> 01:55:55,163
putting that with that little bit of 
hunting pressure on them really changed 

2338
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:01,073
there,
really changed their movements and 

2339
01:56:02,881 --> 01:56:03,714
change the way they perceive human 
threats and they adjust to it pretty 

2340
01:56:06,121 --> 01:56:08,400
quickly,
but it hasn't led to,

2341
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:09,263
you know,
I think a lot of people look in those 

2342
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:15,480
cases where it was pretty effective.
It was very effective to bring in,

2343
01:56:15,481 --> 01:56:16,314
to bring in limited regulated hunting,
had the desire to fact on how we're 

2344
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:20,843
using the landscape and in ways in which
they were interacting and info and 

2345
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:26,740
avoiding humans.
And I have no doubt too,

2346
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:27,593
I have no doubt too,
like it'll the situation will probably 

2347
01:56:30,481 --> 01:56:33,150
in the northern Great Lakes,
they had state management,

2348
01:56:33,151 --> 01:56:34,110
law,
state management,

2349
01:56:34,111 --> 01:56:35,430
like it bounces back and forth.

2350
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:37,080
You're going to,
you're going to eventually,

2351
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:39,030
let me kind of depends on how the 
political winds blow,

2352
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,073
but you're eventually gonna wind up with
it there and you're not going to see 

2353
01:56:42,361 --> 01:56:45,450
wolves vanished from the landscape.
You know,

2354
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:49,320
you're just not.
If grizzly bears wind up doing it,

2355
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:50,101
you're still gonna.
See,

2356
01:56:50,101 --> 01:56:50,934
you're gonna see gradually expanding 
populations of grizzly bears to fight 

2357
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:54,083
despite the fact that they're using 
limited harvest to achieve certain 

2358
01:56:56,791 --> 01:57:00,390
management objectives is not going to be
the end of the world that just not.

2359
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:02,730
Yeah,
I agree with you and I think the grizzly

2360
01:57:02,731 --> 01:57:03,564
bear thing,
you'd probably have the same sort of 

2361
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:05,274
situation where the grizzlies will 
eventually think of people as a threat 

2362
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:09,570
and it'd probably be safer for 
everybody.

2363
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:12,000
That's one thing that people.
That's one thing that people hope,

2364
01:57:12,001 --> 01:57:12,834
and again,
people aren't really a lot of people 

2365
01:57:14,491 --> 01:57:15,630
looking from the outside in.

2366
01:57:15,630 --> 01:57:17,460
I'm very sensitive to it.
Yeah.

2367
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:19,770
To the idea of the way that which that's
you know,

2368
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:22,530
that this has impacted professional 
hunting guides,

2369
01:57:22,531 --> 01:57:24,000
hunters,
but these are my people.

2370
01:57:24,001 --> 01:57:26,250
These are people that I care about and I
care about their needs.

2371
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:28,440
Right.
And it's an issue.

2372
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:32,580
So time will tell where that,
where that winds up.

2373
01:57:32,730 --> 01:57:33,563
Well,
we see an MBC where they've just taken 

2374
01:57:34,951 --> 01:57:35,784
it away and they take it.
They've taken it away in a very 

2375
01:57:37,741 --> 01:57:41,990
irrational way because they have a large
population of grizzlies and pc.

2376
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:45,610
It's very large and for people that live
up there that,

2377
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:46,483
that hunt them,
this is kind of scaring the shit out of 

2378
01:57:48,181 --> 01:57:50,610
them that all of a sudden you've taken 
this away.

2379
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:51,473
First of all,
it was a source of income for a lot of 

2380
01:57:54,601 --> 01:57:58,530
these people that would guide them,
but it was also a smart thing to control

2381
01:57:58,531 --> 01:58:00,780
the population and keep them away from 
humans.

2382
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:06,740
Well that I watched that closely though.
I don't feel it being another country,

2383
01:58:08,761 --> 01:58:10,550
you know,
you don't have that sense of um,

2384
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:13,790
being that other countries don't have 
that sense of the,

2385
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:17,100
of that you could influence,
you know,

2386
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:17,993
so it's Kinda like watching something 
happen in a distant way and you don't 

2387
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:21,923
feel it as closely and I don't know all 
the factors that play as well as I do 

2388
01:58:25,081 --> 01:58:26,430
here.
Well,

2389
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:29,010
I have some friends that live up there.
My friend Mike [inaudible],

2390
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:34,040
who's a guide up there and he told me 
horror stories about grizzlies had shoot

2391
01:58:34,411 --> 01:58:38,930
one trying to get into his cabin from 
six feet away and you know,

2392
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:40,410
their,
their big fuckers,

2393
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,310
they are,
I love them to death.

2394
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:43,300
They're great.
I mean,

2395
01:58:43,301 --> 01:58:45,190
it's cool that they're real.
I mean,

2396
01:58:45,191 --> 01:58:46,024
it really is.
It's a wild thing that there we have 

2397
01:58:49,331 --> 01:58:52,480
this huge monster that lives in the 
woods.

2398
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:54,760
I haven't been charged by him.
I wouldn't change a thing,

2399
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:56,400
man.
You were charged by.

2400
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:57,550
I'm,
I like having.

2401
01:58:57,551 --> 01:59:00,610
I like every encounter in every mixup 
and it's really,

2402
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:06,000
it's like deeply complicated stuff in 
when talking about these things,

2403
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:11,431
it's also they become like everything 
they become a proxy were,

2404
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:12,793
were,
were we're engaged in a debate about 

2405
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,030
what is,
you know,

2406
01:59:16,031 --> 01:59:16,864
we're engaged in debate about like 
conflicting views on wildlife and these 

2407
01:59:20,381 --> 01:59:21,214
animals step in to this debate and the 
debate centers around them and it winds 

2408
01:59:26,441 --> 01:59:29,980
up being bigger than a debate about 
grizzlies.

2409
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:34,000
Bigger than it is a debate about bison 
or buffalo,

2410
01:59:34,001 --> 01:59:36,880
right?
Bigger than a debate about wolves.

2411
01:59:37,030 --> 01:59:37,863
It's just that these animals step into 
this ongoing dialogue about what is our 

2412
01:59:40,781 --> 01:59:41,614
relationship with the natural world?
What does that relationship with 

2413
01:59:43,781 --> 01:59:44,614
renewable resources,
what does that relationship with rural 

2414
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:48,003
versus urban perspectives on how people 
should be around wildlife can be 

2415
01:59:51,041 --> 01:59:51,874
impacted by wildlife and so it's this 
through line of us trying to sort out 

2416
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:57,843
how to be like good,
responsible stewards of the landscape 

2417
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:05,320
and that debate always centers around 
these things.

2418
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:06,213
Like you could have a huge argument 
you'd be like in a lot of tension with 

2419
02:00:08,591 --> 02:00:09,480
your spouse.
Right?

2420
02:00:09,820 --> 02:00:10,653
And it springs up in a debate about how 
best to load the dishwasher or who was 

2421
02:00:14,231 --> 02:00:16,900
supposed to pick up the kid from school 
and there's always like,

2422
02:00:16,901 --> 02:00:19,190
it always finds a place to live.
Um,

2423
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:21,123
and right now we're like this argument 
about American wildlife and what is our 

2424
02:00:25,991 --> 02:00:30,250
relationship to it has found its place 
live right now around large predators.

2425
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:36,070
And in Scotland it's found its way to 
live around a feral goat on an island.

2426
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,190
Well,
that one case,

2427
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:46,530
all the traveling that you do and all 
the hunting trips you go on this,

2428
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:51,430
has it gotten to a point ever that it 
seems like a job?

2429
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:56,030
Yeah.
As now that I have kids,

2430
02:00:56,031 --> 02:00:57,600
I,
it's changed a little bit,

2431
02:00:57,601 --> 02:00:59,690
I view it a little bit differently,
um,

2432
02:01:00,650 --> 02:01:01,610
but no,
I still,

2433
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:03,223
I still really love it and I'm able to 
know that I'm able to know that I'm 

2434
02:01:06,231 --> 02:01:09,470
missing my family while I'm out.
I'm,

2435
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:14,680
I'm able to know that and feel that pain
and still know that I love what I do and

2436
02:01:18,291 --> 02:01:21,340
I love talking about the things that I 
talk about and,

2437
02:01:21,341 --> 02:01:22,670
and you know,
and I view it like as a,

2438
02:01:23,090 --> 02:01:25,490
as I'm sure you do,
like it's like this tremendous privilege

2439
02:01:25,491 --> 02:01:26,324
that you're able to,

2440
02:01:26,910 --> 02:01:27,743
uh,

2441
02:01:29,330 --> 02:01:33,540
Kinda grow up to have to have this like 
intense interest in the subject and this

2442
02:01:33,590 --> 02:01:34,423
intense stress and lifestyle and then 
have the ability to like introduce 

2443
02:01:37,011 --> 02:01:39,910
people to all these different ideas.
Uh,

2444
02:01:40,730 --> 02:01:41,563
so yeah,
I can have those two things 

2445
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:47,750
simultaneous.
I'm the kind of long to be home more but

2446
02:01:47,751 --> 02:01:52,220
enjoying being out.
I think if it would,

2447
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:53,173
if the longing to be home more would 
override that someday it might change 

2448
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:56,684
it.
But right now I'm,

2449
02:01:57,640 --> 02:01:58,473
you know,
I've just have seen so many things that 

2450
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:05,660
I'm happy to have seen and to think 
about a future of not accumulating those

2451
02:02:05,661 --> 02:02:07,910
experiences at the rapid rate that I've 
accumulated.

2452
02:02:07,911 --> 02:02:09,860
And um,
it kind of bums me out a little bit.

2453
02:02:10,090 --> 02:02:11,650
Yeah.
You've lived 100 lives,

2454
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:13,383
you know that the trip that you were 
talking about when you were in South 

2455
02:02:17,110 --> 02:02:20,080
America and the jungle and you came 
across those pictographs.

2456
02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:21,610
What do you say?
How do you call those things?

2457
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:23,080
Petroglyphs.
Petroglyphs,

2458
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:23,973
petroglyphs on the rocks that no one had
any idea who made no one know why they 

2459
02:02:28,361 --> 02:02:29,194
were just there.
Now it's not like a spot on a map that 

2460
02:02:31,811 --> 02:02:33,250
tourists go to visit.
Oh,

2461
02:02:33,251 --> 02:02:34,870
here's the petroglyphs.
No,

2462
02:02:34,871 --> 02:02:36,760
they're just there.
They're just there.

2463
02:02:36,761 --> 02:02:37,990
And the hunters like,
yeah,

2464
02:02:37,991 --> 02:02:40,090
there they are.
The ancient ones made these,

2465
02:02:40,330 --> 02:02:41,350
hey,
let's get the fish.

2466
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:42,480
You know,
they,

2467
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:43,990
they really don't give a shit,
but it's like,

2468
02:02:44,050 --> 02:02:44,760
you're,
you're,

2469
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:49,330
you're seeing who knows how old that is.
Thousand years old years old.

2470
02:02:49,450 --> 02:02:52,140
Yeah.
To run into stuff like that.

2471
02:02:53,730 --> 02:02:55,290
Yeah.
Beautiful experiences,

2472
02:02:55,291 --> 02:02:57,030
man.
And then the,

2473
02:02:57,850 --> 02:03:01,660
you know,
to eat the way I eat and live the way I,

2474
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:02,573
it's,
it's,

2475
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,130
yeah,
I feel fortunate in all the time.

2476
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:07,313
Well,
I think you're very important because 

2477
02:03:08,071 --> 02:03:12,300
there's a,
there's a real lack of well-read,

2478
02:03:12,630 --> 02:03:17,370
articulate people that support your 
position that are in the media.

2479
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:20,670
I mean,
you got a lot of these shows that are on

2480
02:03:20,671 --> 02:03:25,671
these,
the hunting networks that they appeal to

2481
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:30,450
a very narrow bandwidth in this narrow 
bandwidth is,

2482
02:03:30,451 --> 02:03:32,440
you know,
just uh,

2483
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:34,133
it's,
it,

2484
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:40,360
it's like your stereotypical idea of 
what hunting is to a lot of people.

2485
02:03:41,401 --> 02:03:44,580
So they'll flip through the channels 
that watched that for a few minutes.

2486
02:03:44,581 --> 02:03:45,414
You see someone hooting and hollering 
after they shoot something and they get 

2487
02:03:49,501 --> 02:03:54,480
this bad taste in their mouth about it.
Whereas I tell people all the time,

2488
02:03:54,481 --> 02:03:55,314
if you really want to get an 
understanding about what hunting is 

2489
02:03:57,870 --> 02:03:58,703
about,
I always recommend your show because 

2490
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:01,613
your,
your narration and your reverence for 

2491
02:04:05,161 --> 02:04:07,500
what you're doing and the animals and 
just,

2492
02:04:07,501 --> 02:04:08,410
uh,
your,

2493
02:04:08,420 --> 02:04:13,420
your appreciation for how cool the 
experience is and how wild it is,

2494
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:15,730
you know,
for lack of a better term to just,

2495
02:04:15,731 --> 02:04:19,800
to be out there in nature and to be in 
the pursuit of these things.

2496
02:04:19,801 --> 02:04:21,330
And then the,
take these things,

2497
02:04:21,450 --> 02:04:25,410
these wild creatures and feed your 
family and have it become a part of your

2498
02:04:25,411 --> 02:04:28,830
life and to sustain yourself with it.
Primarily,

2499
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:30,960
it's a,
it's you,

2500
02:04:31,110 --> 02:04:35,910
you're giving a perspective that I don't
think is available that I think is,

2501
02:04:35,911 --> 02:04:39,870
uh,
is important because it's just,

2502
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:43,500
there's so many people out that are out 
there that are hunters,

2503
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:44,693
that are smart,
well read people that feel frustrated 

2504
02:04:48,670 --> 02:04:49,141
like,
God.

2505
02:04:49,141 --> 02:04:50,640
I wish everybody could see it the way I 
see it.

2506
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:51,491
Yeah.
I think it's poor.

2507
02:04:51,491 --> 02:04:52,324
And to point out that my love of hunting
and fishing and of living like a hands 

2508
02:05:00,601 --> 02:05:04,470
on relationship with the natural world,
living in close proximity to wildlife,

2509
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:07,920
like my interest in that and desire to 
do that,

2510
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:10,703
uh,

2511
02:05:10,930 --> 02:05:11,763
predated by a long ways.
My ability to talk about why I think 

2512
02:05:16,781 --> 02:05:19,540
that those things are important.
It was there.

2513
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:21,760
It wasn't like I didn't grow up around 
that.

2514
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:22,833
And then later started understanding 
this stuff and thinking about it and 

2515
02:05:25,901 --> 02:05:27,250
then decided like,
well,

2516
02:05:27,850 --> 02:05:30,670
the path for me then considering what I 
know now,

2517
02:05:30,671 --> 02:05:32,620
the path we then would do to figure out 
hunting.

2518
02:05:32,621 --> 02:05:34,810
It was like hunting was there.
I loved it,

2519
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:40,120
I love it today.
And I just had the luxury through what I

2520
02:05:40,121 --> 02:05:42,790
do for a living to spend a lot of time 
thinking about,

2521
02:05:42,791 --> 02:05:43,624
well,
why is that the case if this feels like 

2522
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:46,203
harmonious to you and you can kind of 
live in this and understand and see how 

2523
02:05:49,541 --> 02:05:52,740
you fit into some greater,
you know,

2524
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:54,670
ecological picture,
right?

2525
02:05:54,970 --> 02:05:55,803
Um,
if it does feel that way and that seems 

2526
02:05:57,971 --> 02:06:00,640
to be true,
how is it that like why is that right?

2527
02:06:00,790 --> 02:06:01,623
And it was pushing at those edges that I
eventually developed a way in which I 

2528
02:06:04,751 --> 02:06:08,260
talk about it now.
I meet all kinds of people who live that

2529
02:06:08,261 --> 02:06:11,920
same lifestyle that I lived growing up 
and when I talked to him,

2530
02:06:12,010 --> 02:06:13,660
a thing that they appreciate is just 
that,

2531
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:14,583
that someone is articulating to them 
something that they felt to be true and 

2532
02:06:18,281 --> 02:06:21,370
knew to be true but just hadn't had the 
time or you know,

2533
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:24,520
didn't have the time or ability to 
really go out and express it.

2534
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:28,540
So I just,
I would never want to act like,

2535
02:06:28,541 --> 02:06:29,650
like I've been,
like,

2536
02:06:29,651 --> 02:06:32,650
I certainly have not invented some way 
of thinking about it,

2537
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:36,220
like elbow leopold in Theodore 
Roosevelt,

2538
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:38,250
Gifford Pincho,
uh,

2539
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:42,190
throughout history like Jim Harrison and
Tom mcguane for contemporary writers.

2540
02:06:42,191 --> 02:06:43,024
There's been,
a lot of people have been saying and 

2541
02:06:43,991 --> 02:06:47,800
talking about an experience in the 
outdoors in a way like,

2542
02:06:47,801 --> 02:06:49,930
I haven't invented some new thing.
I'm just like,

2543
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:51,183
I'm trying to.
I'm working toward like articulate and 

2544
02:06:53,381 --> 02:06:56,860
expressing something that has been in 
existence for a long time.

2545
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:58,353
If people see negative stereotypes when 
you're on youtube or see negative 

2546
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:05,440
stereotypes on certain television shows,
a lot of that stuff is self feeding,

2547
02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:08,290
you know,
I think a lot of that stuff gets created

2548
02:07:08,291 --> 02:07:09,124
because it does have a shock value to it
and I would think that that minus the 

2549
02:07:13,631 --> 02:07:14,464
camera,

2550
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:16,583
a lot of minus the camera,
a lot of activities that people might 

2551
02:07:19,981 --> 02:07:24,330
feel are abhorrent might not even be 
taking place where there is a hamming it

2552
02:07:24,331 --> 02:07:27,150
up for the camera that goes on.

2553
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:29,710
Interesting.
Do you think that there's like a sort of

2554
02:07:29,711 --> 02:07:34,120
a stereotypical pattern they feel like 
they have to fall into so they fall into

2555
02:07:34,121 --> 02:07:37,300
it when the camera's on,
like a Dj Strip club voice?

2556
02:07:37,530 --> 02:07:38,730
Yeah.
I think the only thing that,

2557
02:07:38,731 --> 02:07:39,960
there's some of them,
you know what I mean?

2558
02:07:39,961 --> 02:07:40,794
I think there's some of that.
I think there's [inaudible] and there's 

2559
02:07:41,461 --> 02:07:45,060
also lay people a thing that happens 
with people who feel under attack.

2560
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:47,180
Um,
and,

2561
02:07:47,270 --> 02:07:49,560
and in many ways,
you know,

2562
02:07:50,130 --> 02:07:52,860
hunters are under attack and a lot of 
ways and a lot of places.

2563
02:07:52,861 --> 02:07:55,050
And I think that there's a way when 
you're,

2564
02:07:55,051 --> 02:07:59,290
you feel like you're being attacked,
you feel like you're being pigeonholed,

2565
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:04,400
stereotyped or response is to cram it 
right back down someone else's throat.

2566
02:08:06,230 --> 02:08:07,063
Right,
right.

2567
02:08:07,110 --> 02:08:08,010
You're like,
oh,

2568
02:08:08,011 --> 02:08:10,470
I'll show you.
And there's definitely that stuff.

2569
02:08:10,471 --> 02:08:13,380
Or like you fall into this,
us against them,

2570
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:14,880
you know,
fuck down.

2571
02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:16,620
Like I'm gonna,
you know,

2572
02:08:16,621 --> 02:08:19,590
I'll show them how we really are.
Right.

2573
02:08:19,591 --> 02:08:20,424
And you,
you get into this kind of dialogue 

2574
02:08:22,171 --> 02:08:23,250
thing,
it's a lot more pain.

2575
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,113
It's more painful.
I think I'm maybe not more painful is 

2576
02:08:27,601 --> 02:08:29,130
definitely more hard to be like,
okay,

2577
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:31,290
let's,
let's talk about this for real.

2578
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:32,670
This is really something we need to 
discuss.

2579
02:08:32,671 --> 02:08:33,504
Let's dig in and discuss it.
And I think that a lot of people feel 

2580
02:08:36,151 --> 02:08:39,300
like I'm.
That hunting feels like something that's

2581
02:08:39,301 --> 02:08:40,134
natural with them.
They like to do it and they don't feel 

2582
02:08:41,971 --> 02:08:42,804
the need to take the time to explain it.
And when questioning when pressed to 

2583
02:08:45,181 --> 02:08:48,900
explain it,
they maybe kind of lash out,

2584
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:50,920
you know?
Yeah.

2585
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:55,090
It may be lack the ability to look at it
from an outside perspective because it's

2586
02:08:55,091 --> 02:08:58,780
been a part of their life their whole 
life and they don't want to justify it.

2587
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:01,570
Um,
yeah.

2588
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:02,413
It's salt.
There's also the weird thing that as 

2589
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:07,653
much as you can appreciate hunting and 
think of it as an ethical way to 

2590
02:09:11,651 --> 02:09:13,480
acquire,
meet everybody,

2591
02:09:13,481 --> 02:09:16,060
can't do it.
We've got too many people.

2592
02:09:16,061 --> 02:09:17,960
It's untenable and that,
that's,

2593
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:21,130
that's uh,
I mean there's no responsibility for you

2594
02:09:21,131 --> 02:09:23,220
to acknowledge that,
but it's,

2595
02:09:23,450 --> 02:09:27,910
it's something that gets brought up when
people talk about the,

2596
02:09:27,911 --> 02:09:32,911
the how ethical acquisition of meat is 
really like either hunting or you'd have

2597
02:09:34,961 --> 02:09:39,740
to raise something yourself and be 
absolutely aware or get something from a

2598
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:42,850
farmer who's,
you know,

2599
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:43,713
completely ethical from,
from birth to death and you have to be 

2600
02:09:47,470 --> 02:09:49,510
comfortable with that.
But the most ethical,

2601
02:09:49,511 --> 02:09:52,060
in my opinion is a hunting.
But then people always say,

2602
02:09:52,061 --> 02:09:53,380
yeah,
but everybody can hunt.

2603
02:09:54,210 --> 02:09:55,540
Okay.
But I can.

2604
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:56,653
So if I can,
what do I do about the fact that 

2605
02:09:58,151 --> 02:09:58,984
everybody can.

2606
02:09:58,990 --> 02:10:02,260
Well,
everyone could come in.

2607
02:10:02,940 --> 02:10:04,660
It's a moot point because it's just,
it doesn't matter.

2608
02:10:04,661 --> 02:10:06,810
I guess they're not going to,
but no,

2609
02:10:06,820 --> 02:10:11,590
certainly everyone could enter into the 
hunting game,

2610
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:14,380
you know,
you could come in and hunt.

2611
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:15,273
It would just mean that you had a much 
larger pool of people after a limited 

2612
02:10:18,551 --> 02:10:23,551
resource and that limited resource would
be allocated in a different way.

2613
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:24,603
Yeah,
you could have total participation and 

2614
02:10:27,581 --> 02:10:32,110
it would just be that every person's 
slice of the pie will be much smaller,

2615
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:34,070
but it's not,
you know,

2616
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,120
when we look at when a statement like 
looks at like,

2617
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:37,963
what's,
uh,

2618
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:38,953
what,
what's,

2619
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:42,340
what's a Turkey harvest that our state 
could support these,

2620
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:44,180
break the state up into a bunch of 
different units.

2621
02:10:44,181 --> 02:10:46,750
They look at population trends and they 
determine like,

2622
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:47,593
how many Turk you can we afford to 
harvest without impacting the Turkey 

2623
02:10:49,581 --> 02:10:50,270
population?

2624
02:10:50,270 --> 02:10:51,103
Right?
If everyone in the state wanted to 

2625
02:10:52,191 --> 02:10:54,950
chance use the lined up with the same 
number,

2626
02:10:55,530 --> 02:10:57,980
you'd wind up with the same number of 
Turkey's being killed.

2627
02:10:58,370 --> 02:11:00,470
It would just be that you would have 
less opportunity.

2628
02:11:00,650 --> 02:11:02,660
You have to wait longer to get your 
turn.

2629
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:06,000
So it's not that everybody can't.
Um,

2630
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:06,993
I,
I don't think that,

2631
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,020
but it's not even really point because 
everybody will not,

2632
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:11,330
when I do the stuff that I do,
like in,

2633
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:12,233
in writing a wild game cookbook,
I'm doing two things and running wild 

2634
02:11:15,361 --> 02:11:17,390
game took,
but I'm doing the main thing that I feel

2635
02:11:17,391 --> 02:11:18,224
is the most important part of my job are
the most important part of what I am is 

2636
02:11:20,601 --> 02:11:23,600
I'm like having a conversation with 
people who live this lifestyle,

2637
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:28,010
right?
Like those are people that I relate to.

2638
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:33,280
I want to represent the world in a way 
that it enhances their lives,

2639
02:11:34,761 --> 02:11:36,500
provide education,
right.

2640
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:40,250
And share my experiences with an 
audience of people that I recommend is a

2641
02:11:40,251 --> 02:11:43,370
tribe that I'm part of,
which would be like American hunters and

2642
02:11:43,371 --> 02:11:44,204
anglers.
And I'm presenting them like doing a 

2643
02:11:45,471 --> 02:11:48,110
cookbook.
I'm presenting them like best practices,

2644
02:11:48,290 --> 02:11:49,123
how to sort of like live the best 
version of a wild game lifestyle that 

2645
02:11:51,831 --> 02:11:52,664
they can.
Here's the way to think about and 

2646
02:11:53,211 --> 02:11:55,140
approach wild game.
But uh,

2647
02:11:55,190 --> 02:11:56,023
but also the secondary part,
what I'm doing is presenting a world to 

2648
02:11:58,791 --> 02:12:02,450
people who might be unfamiliar with it.
And yes,

2649
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:06,740
do I have the hope that people will like
say,

2650
02:12:07,370 --> 02:12:10,640
read this book and then be like,
man,

2651
02:12:10,641 --> 02:12:11,474
I want to participate in this lifestyle 
that could mean as much as I'm walking 

2652
02:12:14,961 --> 02:12:15,794
down to the local river in their city 
and flipping over rocks and picking up 

2653
02:12:18,081 --> 02:12:20,420
crayfish,
but it is introducing them,

2654
02:12:20,421 --> 02:12:21,254
bringing them into the natural world and
bringing them into engagement with 

2655
02:12:25,041 --> 02:12:28,070
nature and I do view and hope that that 
will happen.

2656
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:29,173
Will it happen in some grand scale where
we'll have hundreds of millions of 

2657
02:12:32,031 --> 02:12:33,080
hundreds in this country?
Now?

2658
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:36,500
That's not going to happen,
but I do think that it is important that

2659
02:12:36,501 --> 02:12:41,501
we do have more people involved.
We in large measure,

2660
02:12:42,650 --> 02:12:43,483
we fund much of our wildlife work and 
management from law enforcement disease 

2661
02:12:47,811 --> 02:12:48,644
research on and on.
We fund that stuff through hunting and 

2662
02:12:50,991 --> 02:12:55,220
fishing licenses and through excise 
taxes on sporting goods equipment.

2663
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,150
If the more people that are engaged with
this activity,

2664
02:12:59,330 --> 02:13:02,300
I think the better it winds up being for
American wildlife.

2665
02:13:02,890 --> 02:13:03,723
I agree,
but the idea is that everyone can't do 

2666
02:13:07,211 --> 02:13:11,050
it.
So the idea that you're saying that this

2667
02:13:11,051 --> 02:13:14,800
is how you ethically acquire meat,
this is not a,

2668
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:17,440
it's not a solution for everyone,
but I don't,

2669
02:13:17,730 --> 02:13:18,430
I don't,
I don't,

2670
02:13:18,430 --> 02:13:20,350
I don't say that this is the only way 
saying you.

2671
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:22,930
I'm saying this is one of the arguments 
that people make.

2672
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,190
If you say that,
you know,

2673
02:13:24,370 --> 02:13:26,290
hey,
I hunt for my meat.

2674
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:28,630
This is how I ethically acquire me.
Well,

2675
02:13:28,631 --> 02:13:31,090
everybody can't do that because there's 
not enough animals.

2676
02:13:31,410 --> 02:13:32,310
Good.
That's true.

2677
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:34,260
That's true.
Everybody can't do that if,

2678
02:13:34,430 --> 02:13:37,230
if even more people got involved.
I mean it's not,

2679
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:38,073
it's,
it's not a solution for the entire 

2680
02:13:39,031 --> 02:13:40,320
population.
You can say,

2681
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,690
well that's good.
The entire population is not going to do

2682
02:13:42,691 --> 02:13:47,691
it anyway,
but it's a that gets into it.

2683
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:48,913
It's a stranger.
There's just the giant number of human 

2684
02:13:51,061 --> 02:13:52,860
beings that need to be fed.
Yeah.

2685
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:57,690
There's almost no other solution than 
the solution that we're doing right now.

2686
02:13:57,691 --> 02:13:58,524
Unless they come up with some sort of a 
lab created meat or whatever the fuck 

2687
02:14:02,491 --> 02:14:04,470
they're gonna come up with next,
which they are.

2688
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:09,010
Do your lips are curling as the 
involuntary?

2689
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:10,173
I said,

2690
02:14:11,350 --> 02:14:13,090
yeah,
I'm pretty happy with,

2691
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:16,150
uh,
I'm pretty happy with my diet right now.

2692
02:14:16,180 --> 02:14:17,200
Yeah.
And um,

2693
02:14:17,201 --> 02:14:18,430
uh,
but,

2694
02:14:18,431 --> 02:14:18,791
uh,
yeah,

2695
02:14:18,791 --> 02:14:21,400
I watched that kind of stuff and I'm 
curious about it,

2696
02:14:21,401 --> 02:14:22,234
but I don't,
I don't take it as a personal insult by 

2697
02:14:23,561 --> 02:14:26,590
any stretch now if everybody switched 
the lab created meat,

2698
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:27,813
but I still had the in.
I still had the ability to continue 

2699
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:33,550
eating how I live,
how I live,

2700
02:14:34,030 --> 02:14:36,100
like I don't view that as being a future
problem.

2701
02:14:36,220 --> 02:14:39,880
Rocky Mountain Elk Federation is 
reintroduced foundation.

2702
02:14:39,881 --> 02:14:40,631
Yep.
What I say,

2703
02:14:40,631 --> 02:14:42,140
Federation Foundation,
um,

2704
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:44,140
they've,
they've introduced elk too,

2705
02:14:44,141 --> 02:14:44,974
a lot of different places and made 
sustainable populations that are now 

2706
02:14:46,930 --> 02:14:49,860
hunted.
And this is me,

2707
02:14:49,861 --> 02:14:50,694
this is a beautiful thing and I'd hope 
that they continue to spread and 

2708
02:14:53,171 --> 02:14:54,004
continue to do that.
Do you think it's possible that other 

2709
02:14:56,381 --> 02:14:57,214
game animals could be reintroduced to 
places where they would develop such a 

2710
02:15:01,031 --> 02:15:01,864
large population that we could sustain 
maybe even double the amount of hunters 

2711
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:07,150
that we have now?
Is that possible?

2712
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:08,620
Well,
put it this way,

2713
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:11,880
yes.
Okay.

2714
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:12,873
For Stars,
yes.

2715
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:16,360
You know that you just pull up an 
article about wolves united selling like

2716
02:15:16,361 --> 02:15:20,830
every article from mainstream news 
sources to get that involves wolves.

2717
02:15:20,831 --> 02:15:21,664
You'll,
you'll kind of detect the bias of the 

2718
02:15:23,350 --> 02:15:24,183
individual writing it and they're saying
how walls have only been recovered 

2719
02:15:27,251 --> 02:15:30,130
across 10 percent of their historic 
range elk.

2720
02:15:31,630 --> 02:15:33,470
That's about the same for elk.
Yeah,

2721
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:34,353
right.
Elk are missing from 80 plus percent of 

2722
02:15:36,851 --> 02:15:39,520
their historic range in the lower 48.
Right.

2723
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:41,670
But we have,
you know,

2724
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:43,373
at various times may have a quarter 
million of them live in Colorado or you 

2725
02:15:46,871 --> 02:15:48,580
know,
some states got $100,000,

2726
02:15:48,581 --> 02:15:51,160
whatever you get now,
perhaps 20,000

2727
02:15:51,161 --> 02:15:53,170
living in Kentucky,
those were all gone.

2728
02:15:53,710 --> 02:15:57,100
New Mexico at a point had zero,
right?

2729
02:15:57,370 --> 02:15:58,500
Michigan,
zero,

2730
02:15:58,510 --> 02:15:59,600
Kentucky,
zero,

2731
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:00,453
Pennsylvania,
zero elk were gone from the unregulated 

2732
02:16:04,211 --> 02:16:06,880
slaughter of the market hunting era when
people could shoot,

2733
02:16:06,881 --> 02:16:10,750
meet and sell it into urban meat 
markets.

2734
02:16:10,751 --> 02:16:12,880
Right?
They eliminate American wild game before

2735
02:16:12,881 --> 02:16:15,430
we figured out how to do what the word I
keep using all the time now,

2736
02:16:15,431 --> 02:16:17,640
which is regulated,
harvest,

2737
02:16:17,830 --> 02:16:18,410
regulate,
uh,

2738
02:16:18,410 --> 02:16:19,620
management.
Um,

2739
02:16:19,870 --> 02:16:24,040
so all that stuff was gone later.
Their estates where there was no,

2740
02:16:24,550 --> 02:16:25,383
uh,
states where there was no deer hunting 

2741
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:28,510
at the time of European contact.

2742
02:16:28,510 --> 02:16:29,343
We had turkeys 39 states.
It got whittled down to target in 19 

2743
02:16:31,481 --> 02:16:34,540
states.
You don't have Turkey hunting seasons in

2744
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:35,433
49 states.
We've done a tremendous job of 

2745
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:40,083
recovering wildlife,
particularly a tremendous job of to 

2746
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:45,963
demonstrate like what happens to an 
animal that hunters value and love and 

2747
02:16:49,331 --> 02:16:50,164
are able to use as a renewable resource 
is those species tend to really enjoy a 

2748
02:16:53,681 --> 02:16:54,514
lot of protections and they thrive 
because people are vested in their best 

2749
02:16:57,221 --> 02:16:58,300
interests.
So yeah,

2750
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:02,590
we've created Turkey hunting seasons in 
30 states.

2751
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:06,760
So yes,
you can recover what you can do things,

2752
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:07,594
a wildlife and like create resources.
The fact that we now we used to argue 

2753
02:17:10,901 --> 02:17:13,570
about what's gonna happen with dear,
we're going to let dr deer to extinction

2754
02:17:13,571 --> 02:17:14,404
in certain states or extra patients.
Certain states now are big argument is 

2755
02:17:16,901 --> 02:17:20,500
what do we do with having so many deer 
here?

2756
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:23,680
It winds up being that you come up 
against social tolerances.

2757
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,690
It's hard to like when we fill in the 
map on elk,

2758
02:17:28,691 --> 02:17:31,510
when Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation looks
and filling in the map on elk,

2759
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:33,293
you got to sell people on the idea that 
you're going to recover elk and there's 

2760
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:37,263
a lot of resistance to recovering 
wildlife because a lot of so it's 

2761
02:17:39,761 --> 02:17:40,594
inconvenient to have around.
They do a great job of brokering deals 

2762
02:17:43,301 --> 02:17:44,134
with states and finding places where you
know a state maybe has a patch of 

2763
02:17:47,051 --> 02:17:47,884
habitat they think could support the 
animals and providing the expertise and 

2764
02:17:50,951 --> 02:17:53,530
financial support and all that stuff 
like bringing in those things,

2765
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:54,753
but generally you wind up where because 
of settlement and cities and suburban 

2766
02:17:59,321 --> 02:18:00,154
areas,
we wound up with fewer and fewer places 

2767
02:18:01,301 --> 02:18:04,580
where we can go and do it.
So to really fill in the map on,

2768
02:18:04,910 --> 02:18:08,050
on recovering elk across all that range 
where they're supposed to be.

2769
02:18:08,430 --> 02:18:10,810
I don't know that we'll get there,
but we've gotten there in a lot of other

2770
02:18:10,811 --> 02:18:13,660
stuff and it was like the wild sheep 
foundation,

2771
02:18:13,661 --> 02:18:14,890
right?
They're trying to do the same thing with

2772
02:18:14,891 --> 02:18:18,970
bighorn sheep.
There is not even social attitudes.

2773
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:23,350
There winds up being disease like they 
spent from domestic sheep.

2774
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:25,240
Yeah.
Their main,

2775
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:26,103
like the main problem preventing us from
recovering bighorn sheep is disease 

2776
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:35,020
types of pneumonia.
The come from domestic sheep.

2777
02:18:35,170 --> 02:18:37,360
Wow.
And people you know,

2778
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:38,253
to go in and say to someone who's 
running sheep on a mountain domestic 

2779
02:18:40,631 --> 02:18:42,280
sheep on a mountain and say,
Hey,

2780
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:45,610
no insult you and no insult to the,
you know,

2781
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:50,640
your forebears who've been sheep 
ranchers here for 120 years or whatever.

2782
02:18:50,651 --> 02:18:51,484
But we would like to try to recover 
American wildlife and bring big horns 

2783
02:18:53,861 --> 02:18:54,694
back to this mountain range and that's 
going to require you moving these sheep 

2784
02:18:56,381 --> 02:18:56,680
out of the way.

2785
02:18:56,680 --> 02:18:57,513
It's an insulting idea that people.
So there's a blocker there and every 

2786
02:19:02,351 --> 02:19:04,660
animal has it's own type of problem.
Turkeys.

2787
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:08,390
It worked because people don't,
don't get pissed about tr,

2788
02:19:08,410 --> 02:19:11,110
you know,
like having them around and then look at

2789
02:19:11,111 --> 02:19:13,600
what's going on with just allowing,
you know,

2790
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:16,390
allowing bison the walkout of 
yellowstone national park.

2791
02:19:16,770 --> 02:19:21,160
It's been an issue for a quarter century
now.

2792
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:23,253
People are like,
I'm not comfortable with you letting 

2793
02:19:24,671 --> 02:19:25,504
these big ass things walk out of the 
park and roam around because of disease 

2794
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:31,790
grazing.
Right.

2795
02:19:31,791 --> 02:19:35,000
There's like people don't want to be 
inconvenienced by wildlife.

2796
02:19:35,001 --> 02:19:38,660
These are places where I would be like 
in that area.

2797
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:40,740
I'd really like to see like when a.
When a.

2798
02:19:40,790 --> 02:19:44,540
When a bison leave the park,
he stops being a wild animal and becomes

2799
02:19:44,541 --> 02:19:45,374
livestock.

2800
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:49,270
What's going on with that American 
Savannah thing?

2801
02:19:50,530 --> 02:19:51,310
What does that,
that,

2802
02:19:51,310 --> 02:19:53,380
that program.
The Apr?

2803
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:54,281
Yeah.
What do they call them?

2804
02:19:54,281 --> 02:19:55,960
That again?
The American prairie reserve.

2805
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:58,090
Yeah.
What is going on with that?

2806
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:00,790
Explained what the fuck that is because 
this is crazy.

2807
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:06,130
I mean,
I know it's a long story too long.

2808
02:20:06,430 --> 02:20:07,380
Yeah.
We're gonna have.

2809
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:08,970
We're.
We're working with having the.

2810
02:20:09,010 --> 02:20:12,460
It's too long.
We're working with having the founder on

2811
02:20:12,461 --> 02:20:12,980
our show.

2812
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:14,500
Yeah.
To have a conversation.

2813
02:20:14,510 --> 02:20:15,343
Prayer Reserve.
They're essentially trying to do is 

2814
02:20:16,851 --> 02:20:21,260
reintroduce a bunch of animals into a 
gigantic chunk of land and they continue

2815
02:20:21,261 --> 02:20:22,094
to buy up more of this land and why 
aren't they running block management on 

2816
02:20:27,291 --> 02:20:28,540
this as well?
Yes.

2817
02:20:29,690 --> 02:20:31,240
There's a lot.
There's a lot,

2818
02:20:31,460 --> 02:20:32,293
yeah,
there's a lot of suspicions and 

2819
02:20:34,601 --> 02:20:36,880
controversy and it's like a,
it's a,

2820
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:40,180
it's an idea that a lot of people are 
uneasy with,

2821
02:20:40,181 --> 02:20:42,370
but the problem,
not the problem.

2822
02:20:42,371 --> 02:20:44,300
The thing is it's like people who are,
you know,

2823
02:20:44,470 --> 02:20:46,000
they,
they have uh,

2824
02:20:46,090 --> 02:20:48,370
they have funding and have a thing where
there,

2825
02:20:48,810 --> 02:20:49,643
when land comes for sale,
they buy it and the goal of buying up 

2826
02:20:51,911 --> 02:20:55,720
the land is to turn it back into,
you know,

2827
02:20:56,440 --> 02:21:00,730
turn it back into wildlife habitat for 
native wildlife and at wine.

2828
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:03,280
It's contrary.
It's the controversy around.

2829
02:21:03,281 --> 02:21:04,114
It stems from the fact that some people 
don't like to see areas that were 

2830
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:12,790
supported like traditional economies in 
rural areas like cattle ranching and,

2831
02:21:12,950 --> 02:21:13,783
and to see these,
see these areas returning to a wild 

2832
02:21:18,761 --> 02:21:19,594
landscape is threatening to people from 
the hunter perspective is they're 

2833
02:21:24,761 --> 02:21:25,460
allowing.

2834
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:26,293
There's lot of places that people used 
to be able to hunt and the American 

2835
02:21:28,721 --> 02:21:29,554
prairie reserve is allowing hunting to 
go on and people are coming in and 

2836
02:21:32,081 --> 02:21:32,441
saying,
well,

2837
02:21:32,441 --> 02:21:33,274
they need to make sure that they need to
assure us that hunting will be allowed 

2838
02:21:36,071 --> 02:21:36,904
here in perpetuity.
And because we're suspicious about 

2839
02:21:40,930 --> 02:21:42,790
what's going on,
so there's a lot of,

2840
02:21:42,791 --> 02:21:44,830
like,
you hear about it in so many ways,

2841
02:21:44,831 --> 02:21:46,840
but the core mission is something that 
most people,

2842
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:48,460
um,
when you look at it,

2843
02:21:48,461 --> 02:21:49,294
the core mission,
something that most people are going to 

2844
02:21:50,891 --> 02:21:52,330
look at it and be pretty comfortable 
with,

2845
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:52,961
be like,
okay,

2846
02:21:52,961 --> 02:21:55,300
you're a guy or an organization,
you have money.

2847
02:21:55,390 --> 02:21:58,360
And when a ranch comes up for sale,
you buy it on the open market.

2848
02:21:59,170 --> 02:22:01,900
Seller names is price.
You pay,

2849
02:22:01,901 --> 02:22:06,130
the price is now your land if you choose
to not run cattle.

2850
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:10,510
But wanna have bison roam around on it.
Why should I care?

2851
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:11,800
Right.
Right.

2852
02:22:11,830 --> 02:22:15,520
But people do care because they look at 
it as being like a value judgment.

2853
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:17,713
Uh,
they look at it as being like a value 

2854
02:22:19,241 --> 02:22:22,390
judgment about rural economies and about
agriculture.

2855
02:22:23,020 --> 02:22:26,000
Oh Huh.
I didn't think

2856
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:26,833
about that.
And there's a thousand more aspects of 

2857
02:22:29,010 --> 02:22:33,570
this were like,
it's a rich subject.

2858
02:22:33,571 --> 02:22:35,050
Dude.
I'd love to get into it more about it.

2859
02:22:36,790 --> 02:22:38,110
Next time I come on.
Okay.

2860
02:22:38,380 --> 02:22:40,870
Next time you can take like an hour to 
explain the situation.

2861
02:22:41,050 --> 02:22:45,100
What is their long term plan like?
How long is this going on for?

2862
02:22:45,460 --> 02:22:46,840
It's been going on for quite a while,
right?

2863
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:47,693
Oh,
the longterm play is that overtime you 

2864
02:22:50,921 --> 02:22:51,754
would assemble a p,
a chunk of the great plains that is far 

2865
02:22:54,821 --> 02:22:55,654
bigger than yellowstone national park 
that supports a thriving population of 

2866
02:23:01,090 --> 02:23:03,670
Bison Wolves,
grizzly bears,

2867
02:23:04,390 --> 02:23:06,070
um,
you know,

2868
02:23:06,190 --> 02:23:08,380
in a,
in a park like setting,

2869
02:23:10,330 --> 02:23:13,590
but it doesn't come without a,
you know,

2870
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:15,820
it doesn't come without its own bits of 
controversy

2871
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:19,033
and

2872
02:23:19,990 --> 02:23:20,920
yeah,
again,

2873
02:23:20,921 --> 02:23:22,840
it's like it's the thing that everyone 
has opinions about there.

2874
02:23:22,850 --> 02:23:25,470
There was a version they don't like to 
talk about that.

2875
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:26,313
There was a version of this called the 
Buffalo Commons that happened long ago 

2876
02:23:28,421 --> 02:23:30,590
where a,
um,

2877
02:23:30,910 --> 02:23:31,743
there was a social scientist named,
I think it was frank popper by the last 

2878
02:23:35,501 --> 02:23:39,610
name of popper and he was looking at 
demographic patterns on the Great Plains

2879
02:23:39,850 --> 02:23:42,940
and he was observing the ways in which 
the,

2880
02:23:42,941 --> 02:23:46,930
the gray areas on the great plains,
where the population was shrinking.

2881
02:23:47,410 --> 02:23:48,243
Okay.
So there's a lot of counties and on the 

2882
02:23:51,550 --> 02:23:52,383
Great Plains where through various like 
longterm agricultural trends and other 

2883
02:23:56,021 --> 02:23:58,780
issues where the human population is 
rapidly shrinking,

2884
02:23:58,840 --> 02:23:59,673
rapidly declining.
And this sociologist brought up this 

2885
02:24:05,501 --> 02:24:06,334
idea that if these trends continue,
you're going to have this rare case in 

2886
02:24:10,151 --> 02:24:14,860
which a landscape sort of accidentally 
rewilding.

2887
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:18,040
Okay.
[inaudible] where everyone left,

2888
02:24:18,430 --> 02:24:21,250
which is not a story we're familiar with
when we look at what happened.

2889
02:24:21,250 --> 02:24:23,170
So wildlands,
you know,

2890
02:24:23,171 --> 02:24:24,040
across the world,
right?

2891
02:24:24,041 --> 02:24:26,500
The general stories like people move in 
and wildlife moves out.

2892
02:24:26,830 --> 02:24:29,770
So this idea that became the Buffalo 
Commons.

2893
02:24:29,890 --> 02:24:31,600
Okay.
And that was,

2894
02:24:31,790 --> 02:24:35,380
it just so happens that,
that idea that this,

2895
02:24:35,660 --> 02:24:38,290
the idea kind of centered around this 
area on Jordan,

2896
02:24:38,291 --> 02:24:39,460
Montana,
right?

2897
02:24:39,970 --> 02:24:44,020
Because you have large tracks of 
federally managed public land up there,

2898
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:45,093
you had a lot of ag like ranch land that
wasn't that expensive and people could 

2899
02:24:49,811 --> 02:24:51,790
buy it.
And that was like the seed of the idea.

2900
02:24:51,791 --> 02:24:52,624
I think that now that was such an 
unpopular notion because it had to do 

2901
02:24:55,031 --> 02:24:57,010
with like economic decay,
right?

2902
02:24:57,011 --> 02:24:57,844
And shrinking towns and reduced 
resources for public education and all 

2903
02:25:01,021 --> 02:25:03,490
that kinds of stuff that comes from 
having an economy that is not thriving,

2904
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:09,540
but over time that like Buffalo Commons 
idea kind of segwayed into this American

2905
02:25:10,631 --> 02:25:11,464
prairie reserve idea and it happened to 
be sort of centered around the same 

2906
02:25:13,991 --> 02:25:16,630
chunk of land.
Bill Kittridge,

2907
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:21,400
a Western writer who deals with a lot of
landscape and environmental issues,

2908
02:25:21,670 --> 02:25:22,503
was talking about a in the wake of the 
Buffalo Commons idea and poppers work 

2909
02:25:26,921 --> 02:25:27,754
was talking about going to Jordan,
Montana and talking about the Buffalo 

2910
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:35,620
Commons is a great way to get your ass 
kicked because it's this idea like if,

2911
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:36,603
if culturally,
like the agricultural producers and 

2912
02:25:38,981 --> 02:25:39,814
ranchers were celebrated and they made a
civilization out of the wilderness and 

2913
02:25:42,641 --> 02:25:46,180
they brought an animals and created 
economies and creative communities.

2914
02:25:46,510 --> 02:25:48,510
And for someone to now say,
you know,

2915
02:25:48,610 --> 02:25:49,870
thanks,
but no thanks bro.

2916
02:25:51,230 --> 02:25:52,063
We'd rather go back and eliminate your 
presence on this landscape and we don't 

2917
02:25:56,901 --> 02:26:00,140
in fact value what you did.
And we're going to try as hard as we can

2918
02:26:00,141 --> 02:26:00,974
to undo what you did because we now view
it as the you did the year people did 

2919
02:26:06,091 --> 02:26:08,040
the wrong thing.
We're going to correct that wrong.

2920
02:26:08,430 --> 02:26:09,263
And some like it.
Some people it's like this insulting 

2921
02:26:13,981 --> 02:26:17,100
idea to a lot of other people,
they celebrate it because they're like,

2922
02:26:17,101 --> 02:26:19,230
hey,
if it's for sale and I buy it,

2923
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:22,720
it's mine.
I could see it from both perspectives.

2924
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:23,410
German,
it's,

2925
02:26:23,410 --> 02:26:25,450
it's.
It's very much like the hunting thing.

2926
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:28,330
If you're a part of it,
you have a deep history in it.

2927
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:33,250
You understand that your perspective of 
ranching is from a rancher.

2928
02:26:33,550 --> 02:26:34,383
Whereas people in the outside 
conveniently can be ignorant about it 

2929
02:26:36,611 --> 02:26:37,021
and go,
oh,

2930
02:26:37,021 --> 02:26:39,070
fuck those ranchers.
I want to see the buffalo.

2931
02:26:39,220 --> 02:26:39,720
Yeah.

2932
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:42,110
In my perspective,
my perspective on wildlife has been,

2933
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:44,820
it's the thing that you.
It's the thing that you care about,

2934
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:49,380
your work to conserve.
You want to have it on the landscape and

2935
02:26:49,381 --> 02:26:50,510
you also eat a lot of it out of it.

2936
02:26:51,610 --> 02:26:53,240
That's a foreign idea.
Yeah,

2937
02:26:53,390 --> 02:26:56,960
it is.
I'm glad that you can't sell wild game.

2938
02:26:56,990 --> 02:26:59,000
I'm glad that mark and hunting is not a 
thing.

2939
02:26:59,180 --> 02:27:00,013
However,
I would really love it if there was a 

2940
02:27:02,241 --> 02:27:07,241
restaurant where you could go where you 
could buy like really well prepared wild

2941
02:27:08,631 --> 02:27:12,320
game dishes,
like a really well prepared bear.

2942
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:16,100
Really well prepared mountain lion,
well prepared,

2943
02:27:16,130 --> 02:27:18,200
you know,
fill in the blank with the animal.

2944
02:27:18,470 --> 02:27:20,960
I just think that would be a fascinating
place to eat,

2945
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:22,273
you know,
and maybe maybe if they could do 

2946
02:27:23,721 --> 02:27:24,554
something like that,
it wouldn't be that you could actually 

2947
02:27:25,941 --> 02:27:26,774
sell the meat.
I mean there have to be some weird work 

2948
02:27:28,371 --> 02:27:29,204
around it.
Have to be like someone have to come to 

2949
02:27:33,290 --> 02:27:34,670
one of my dinner parties.
I would have.

2950
02:27:34,730 --> 02:27:35,780
No,
that's fine.

2951
02:27:35,781 --> 02:27:38,600
But I mean,
but I would like it if there was a place

2952
02:27:38,601 --> 02:27:41,750
where the general public could 
participate in it,

2953
02:27:42,170 --> 02:27:43,003
I think they'd get a better 
understanding and like I put up these 

2954
02:27:45,171 --> 02:27:48,110
posts all the time of elk that I cook 
and people like,

2955
02:27:48,111 --> 02:27:49,430
God damn,
I want to eat some of that.

2956
02:27:49,490 --> 02:27:51,500
I eat that.
How do you eat that?

2957
02:27:51,890 --> 02:27:53,480
You got to go get one of them.
You know?

2958
02:27:53,530 --> 02:27:55,040
I mean,
it's the only way you can eat that.

2959
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:56,300
Yeah.
Well you can buy.

2960
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:57,141
Come to my house.
Yeah,

2961
02:27:57,141 --> 02:27:59,090
you can go and buy the farm raised 
version,

2962
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:03,260
but then that's one.
Yeah.

2963
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:05,510
Good luck getting a farm raised 
blueberry,

2964
02:28:05,511 --> 02:28:06,470
black bear.
Yeah.

2965
02:28:06,500 --> 02:28:07,670
Well No,
not that case,

2966
02:28:07,671 --> 02:28:08,504
but like,
you know,

2967
02:28:08,690 --> 02:28:09,950
you could buy,
but then it's,

2968
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:12,500
that's a whole other conversation around
the captive service industry.

2969
02:28:12,501 --> 02:28:13,460
But yeah,
you can buy,

2970
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,910
you can buy elk that are raised on a 
ranch environment.

2971
02:28:16,911 --> 02:28:17,900
Right?
Yeah.

2972
02:28:17,901 --> 02:28:19,700
I mean as long as you're getting it from
New Zealand,

2973
02:28:19,701 --> 02:28:20,534
you're not dealing with cwd in lot of 
the other issues that they're dealing 

2974
02:28:22,431 --> 02:28:23,450
with in America.
Right?

2975
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,071
Well,
yeah,

2976
02:28:24,071 --> 02:28:25,610
but I mean they're,
you know,

2977
02:28:25,650 --> 02:28:30,610
those places are tested in herds that 
have cwd Nmr destroyed.

2978
02:28:30,780 --> 02:28:32,470
Right.
Um,

2979
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,470
yeah,
but the.

2980
02:28:34,470 --> 02:28:35,303
Well the whole New Zealand thing,
there was an interesting thing that you 

2981
02:28:37,041 --> 02:28:39,290
brought up on your podcast recently.
Um,

2982
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:40,273
how New Zealand,
they've been talks about actual 

2983
02:28:42,441 --> 02:28:46,220
eradication and one of the arguments 
that hunters always use is,

2984
02:28:46,221 --> 02:28:47,870
hey,
we're controlling the population.

2985
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:49,930
This is a good service that we're 
providing.

2986
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:51,710
And then the government comes along and 
says,

2987
02:28:51,711 --> 02:28:53,900
well how about we take care of that?
And everybody's like,

2988
02:28:53,901 --> 02:28:56,450
Hey,
well not so fast.

2989
02:28:56,690 --> 02:29:00,930
Yeah,
it's a that takes place in Australia and

2990
02:29:00,931 --> 02:29:01,764
New Zealand where they have these like 
thriving very robust populations of non 

2991
02:29:05,821 --> 02:29:09,000
native wildlife and the government has 
all,

2992
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:09,863
does,
has always and does now do a lot of 

2993
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:15,570
calling of these animals.
They don't have predators,

2994
02:29:15,630 --> 02:29:18,450
right?
They have like extremely,

2995
02:29:18,470 --> 02:29:19,303
like they're very fecund,
extremely high reproductive rates and 

2996
02:29:21,361 --> 02:29:23,730
they,
the government is actively engaged,

2997
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:24,733
you know,
around the clock gunning wildlife from 

2998
02:29:28,591 --> 02:29:29,424
helicopters shooting,
just letting it run and shoot and leave 

2999
02:29:31,471 --> 02:29:33,360
it to rot because you have to because 
they're trying.

3000
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:34,813
You have to.
But they do that because they're trying 

3001
02:29:36,151 --> 02:29:36,984
to protect certain ecosystems and keep 
like a lot of native plant species from 

3002
02:29:45,061 --> 02:29:48,150
going extinct and fragile environments 
and all kinds of reasons.

3003
02:29:48,190 --> 02:29:49,500
Like said there's no death,
right?

3004
02:29:49,501 --> 02:29:50,820
There's no,
there's no credit.

3005
02:29:50,850 --> 02:29:52,830
There's no Predator control on.
Which is huge.

3006
02:29:53,210 --> 02:29:54,043
And in a lot of places,
just completely inadequate amount of 

3007
02:29:56,311 --> 02:29:59,640
hunting and a thing that hunters have 
eyes been able to say in Australia.

3008
02:29:59,650 --> 02:30:04,380
New Zealand as they've been in a little 
too with an a in a culture where,

3009
02:30:04,650 --> 02:30:05,483
particularly in Australia,
like a culture that seems to be not as 

3010
02:30:07,351 --> 02:30:09,030
friendly toward hunters as they are in 
America.

3011
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:10,561
You're able to say,
well,

3012
02:30:10,561 --> 02:30:12,900
you know,
we're participating in wildlife control.

3013
02:30:13,410 --> 02:30:17,200
And then later when people come up and 
they talk about,

3014
02:30:17,201 --> 02:30:17,551
well,
you know what,

3015
02:30:17,551 --> 02:30:18,384
we're going to get serious about this 
and we're going to really actively with 

3016
02:30:22,771 --> 02:30:25,650
a goal of like totally eliminating these
species.

3017
02:30:26,370 --> 02:30:30,280
People are justifiably made uneasy about
it because it's a,

3018
02:30:30,281 --> 02:30:31,114
it's a thing that they've come to 
appreciate and rely on in a resource 

3019
02:30:33,781 --> 02:30:34,980
that they want to use.
And now they're like,

3020
02:30:34,990 --> 02:30:35,940
whoa,
wait a minute.

3021
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:38,280
Oh,
kill them all.

3022
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:41,220
I do like them being here and it winds 
up putting you in this weird.

3023
02:30:41,221 --> 02:30:46,221
Like it winds up putting you in a,
in a weird rhetorical position.

3024
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:48,780
But I understand where they're coming 
from because if,

3025
02:30:48,781 --> 02:30:49,614
um,
if you could live there and you could 

3026
02:30:50,490 --> 02:30:51,323
agree that we're going to have some 
small number of them on the landscape 

3027
02:30:53,341 --> 02:30:55,110
and then we're going to use those and 
we're going to hunt those.

3028
02:30:55,111 --> 02:30:56,320
And eat those.
Um,

3029
02:30:56,490 --> 02:30:58,260
I also,
if someone said,

3030
02:30:58,261 --> 02:30:59,220
hey,
they're gone now,

3031
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:00,460
I would be bummed.
Yeah.

3032
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:01,860
I Hunt Turkeys that I was saying 
earlier.

3033
02:31:01,861 --> 02:31:04,500
We had turkeys in 39 states at the time 
of European contact.

3034
02:31:04,501 --> 02:31:08,340
We have turkeys and for United States 
now I hunt Turkeys and a lot of those 10

3035
02:31:08,341 --> 02:31:12,810
states that didn't historically have 
turkeys and that do now.

3036
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:13,793
And I generally have a perspective of 
trying to preserve native wildlife and 

3037
02:31:16,081 --> 02:31:16,914
trying to control non natives because I 
don't want to wind up with sort of a 

3038
02:31:19,330 --> 02:31:20,163
like monolithic wildlife pattern or the 
same super resilient adaptive species 

3039
02:31:24,091 --> 02:31:24,924
such as Canada geese and rats and white 
tail deer take over the entire country 

3040
02:31:28,470 --> 02:31:29,290
and pigs.

3041
02:31:29,290 --> 02:31:30,360
So you're like,
yes,

3042
02:31:30,361 --> 02:31:32,760
I want like the variety.
So I'm generally like,

3043
02:31:32,850 --> 02:31:37,740
antagonistic toward non natives.
But if someone came and said I'm okay,

3044
02:31:37,741 --> 02:31:38,574
you know what,
we're going to actually go in and kill 

3045
02:31:40,111 --> 02:31:40,944
off all the turkeys.
And those 10 states that historically 

3046
02:31:42,751 --> 02:31:45,470
didn't have turkeys,
I would say like how,

3047
02:31:45,510 --> 02:31:46,343
you know really because I've kind of 
grown to really like those turkeys and 

3048
02:31:50,671 --> 02:31:52,560
they're not really causing a problem.
Right.

3049
02:31:52,561 --> 02:31:54,100
And I think that some people,
you know,

3050
02:31:54,101 --> 02:31:56,430
if the New Zealand hunter and Australian
Hunter,

3051
02:31:57,140 --> 02:31:59,340
I don't think anyone's arguing,
there should be no control,

3052
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:02,070
but I think that they're like,
let's find a balance.

3053
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,970
I think we can find a balance with,
there's some availability animals on the

3054
02:32:05,971 --> 02:32:08,430
landscape since they've been here since 
the beginning of our,

3055
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:10,710
you know,
experience on this continent.

3056
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:13,800
Uh,
if there's some availability of animals,

3057
02:32:13,801 --> 02:32:15,570
that's fine.
Like a reasonable compromise here.

3058
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:18,180
Well that was one of the discussions as 
well about Hawaii,

3059
02:32:18,270 --> 02:32:19,110
right?
Like,

3060
02:32:19,111 --> 02:32:21,600
and some of the Hawaiian islands 
eradicating the pigs.

3061
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:24,270
And then the Hawaiians were saying,
well,

3062
02:32:24,540 --> 02:32:26,400
they've been here as long as us.
Yeah,

3063
02:32:26,401 --> 02:32:29,790
we've both been here that our ancestors 
have been here 1100 years.

3064
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:33,630
They brought the pig with them.
How am I a native Hawaiian?

3065
02:32:34,330 --> 02:32:36,150
And the pig has the go.
There's like,

3066
02:32:36,151 --> 02:32:37,280
maybe you people ought to go.

3067
02:32:40,820 --> 02:32:42,690
I always like again,
man,

3068
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:47,720
I always instinctively when I hear stuff
I instinctively lean in on.

3069
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:51,840
I instinctively lean in from the 
perspective of,

3070
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:53,513
you know,
instinctively lean in from the 

3071
02:32:54,061 --> 02:32:57,240
perspective of the hunter and Angler,
you know,

3072
02:32:57,241 --> 02:32:58,160
and like,
and,

3073
02:32:58,220 --> 02:32:59,053
and I love all these little debates and 
I think that they're all really helpful 

3074
02:33:03,631 --> 02:33:05,430
and interesting.
But um,

3075
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:06,773
no,
I feel like I can recognize their pain 

3076
02:33:08,430 --> 02:33:11,670
and that can also look far away and,
and laugh at the absurdity of it.

3077
02:33:11,671 --> 02:33:12,504
Like I even had a guy write me from 
Australia and say this is a real bummer 

3078
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:20,030
because it exposes us to the thing where
we got to say like,

3079
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:21,181
yeah,
you know what,

3080
02:33:21,181 --> 02:33:22,014
I wasn't really just doing it because 
I'm trying to help the ecosystem by 

3081
02:33:24,781 --> 02:33:27,660
eliminating non natives.
Um,

3082
02:33:27,690 --> 02:33:28,523
I actually like having someone around 
and now I just got to come out and say 

3083
02:33:30,541 --> 02:33:31,380
that.
And that's a bummer.

3084
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:34,553
I wish.
I really do wish there was some sort of 

3085
02:33:35,791 --> 02:33:39,630
a restaurant.
I think there would be a great place for

3086
02:33:39,631 --> 02:33:43,230
people to get a perspective.
There's no way to do that though,

3087
02:33:43,231 --> 02:33:43,891
Huh?
No,

3088
02:33:43,891 --> 02:33:45,660
but I know there's not.
Well,

3089
02:33:45,661 --> 02:33:46,494
I mean,
not for all the things that you're 

3090
02:33:47,041 --> 02:33:49,740
talking about now and I don't,
and I don't look too,

3091
02:33:50,230 --> 02:33:51,063
um,
there is talk of a lot of people are 

3092
02:33:54,811 --> 02:33:57,230
looking to um,
are,

3093
02:33:57,260 --> 02:34:00,480
are pushing for this idea that in areas 
that have too many white tail deer,

3094
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:04,560
um,
there's people who are really pushing to

3095
02:34:04,561 --> 02:34:05,394
reopen up the sale of,
of wild harvested dear as a solution to 

3096
02:34:10,130 --> 02:34:12,030
dear overpopulation.
But um,

3097
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:13,073
but for me from the perspective,
from my perspective and from the damage 

3098
02:34:16,921 --> 02:34:20,110
that was caused by unregulated wildlife 
slaughter,

3099
02:34:20,550 --> 02:34:22,510
I'm just,
I'm very,

3100
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:23,403
very uneasy with it and I do not picture
myself ever coming around and supported 

3101
02:34:27,821 --> 02:34:30,090
the idea that we would start marketing 
a,

3102
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:33,130
that we would start marketing wild 
cervids

3103
02:34:33,370 --> 02:34:34,203
no,
I agree.

3104
02:34:34,210 --> 02:34:35,043
And I think that just the sheer 
possibility of fuckery and people 

3105
02:34:41,231 --> 02:34:43,880
shooting them and coaching them and 
selling them and it's just,

3106
02:34:44,670 --> 02:34:45,650
and,
and just,

3107
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:48,090
it's a,
it would increase the commodification of

3108
02:34:48,091 --> 02:34:49,050
wildlife.
Yeah.

3109
02:34:49,180 --> 02:34:49,860
Um,
and,

3110
02:34:49,860 --> 02:34:50,693
and that's something that,
and that's something that I'm also just 

3111
02:34:54,990 --> 02:34:55,823
uncomfortable with in general,
the commodification of wildlife and I 

3112
02:34:57,841 --> 02:35:01,860
think about resource availability for 
hunters.

3113
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:02,933
And I think that a lot of people who 
enjoy access to certain areas now to go 

3114
02:35:06,631 --> 02:35:07,464
hunting to,
to like hunt for themselves and their 

3115
02:35:09,301 --> 02:35:10,134
family that the minute you made it be 
that those deer had a dollar value 

3116
02:35:14,700 --> 02:35:15,533
attached to them,
there'll be a lot less opportunity for 

3117
02:35:18,511 --> 02:35:19,344
people who choose to hunt to feed 
themselves because it will all of a 

3118
02:35:23,011 --> 02:35:26,190
sudden be like,
why would I let you come in or allow you

3119
02:35:26,191 --> 02:35:27,024
to come in and use a resource when I'm 
just going to do my best now to collect 

3120
02:35:30,331 --> 02:35:32,820
it up and sell it.
Yeah.

3121
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:36,600
And so again,
for aesthetic reasons,

3122
02:35:36,930 --> 02:35:40,530
for what it would mean for hunters,
for our,

3123
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:41,393
our perception of our relationship with 
our resources that I'm extremely 

3124
02:35:45,211 --> 02:35:46,044
uncomfortable with the ice cube.
It's an idea that keeps popping up 

3125
02:35:49,020 --> 02:35:51,720
because we have in some areas,
um,

3126
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:52,530
and I,
and I usually,

3127
02:35:52,530 --> 02:35:54,570
I hate to say that I hate top of ours.
Too many deer.

3128
02:35:54,571 --> 02:35:55,404
There's too much this,
too much debt because like by WHO's 

3129
02:35:56,400 --> 02:35:58,320
measurement.
But in some areas we really do,

3130
02:35:58,770 --> 02:36:00,360
especially when you start getting into 
the,

3131
02:36:00,410 --> 02:36:03,390
to issues like lyme disease prevalence 
and ticks.

3132
02:36:03,410 --> 02:36:04,243
And starvation and then just the 
possibility of other disease outbreaks 

3133
02:36:07,501 --> 02:36:09,210
and the spread of certain wildlife 
diseases.

3134
02:36:09,211 --> 02:36:12,180
There's some areas that like by any 
reasonable measurement.

3135
02:36:12,181 --> 02:36:13,020
We have too many deer.

3136
02:36:14,030 --> 02:36:15,500
Yeah.
Um,

3137
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:17,720
well look,
it's already 1:00.

3138
02:36:17,830 --> 02:36:19,160
Oh,
how crazy is that?

3139
02:36:20,330 --> 02:36:25,040
Time flies in this room.
Your podcast is awesome.

3140
02:36:25,070 --> 02:36:27,110
It really is.
I'm glad to talk to you to doing it.

3141
02:36:28,050 --> 02:36:30,050
I owe it all to you and I.
and every chance I get,

3142
02:36:30,051 --> 02:36:31,640
I point to it.
I appreciate it.

3143
02:36:31,970 --> 02:36:34,620
I really do appreciate that you do it 
because I think it's,

3144
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:37,310
it's my favorite podcast to recommend to
people that want,

3145
02:36:37,370 --> 02:36:42,370
if I want them to get an understanding 
of hunting without even watching it.

3146
02:36:43,610 --> 02:36:45,960
Just listening to you talk about because
he has.

3147
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:49,610
He have so many guests on where he might
not even be talking about hunting.

3148
02:36:49,611 --> 02:36:52,700
You might be talking about biology,
might be talking about history.

3149
02:36:53,300 --> 02:36:54,250
You know,
it's a,

3150
02:36:54,290 --> 02:36:57,350
it's just a great podcast and you're a 
great guy for the job.

3151
02:36:57,800 --> 02:36:58,633
You,
you play a very important part out 

3152
02:36:59,451 --> 02:37:00,200
there.
I really,

3153
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:01,040
really believe that.

3154
02:37:01,100 --> 02:37:01,933
Thank you.
I appreciate it and I'm glad you talked 

3155
02:37:03,891 --> 02:37:07,700
me to doing it has been a in terms of 
all the things I do,

3156
02:37:08,720 --> 02:37:13,720
the TV writing is the thing that I enjoy
doing it the,

3157
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:18,260
it was a lot of things I enjoy having 
done it more.

3158
02:37:18,410 --> 02:37:19,243
Right.
But the thing that I enjoy actually 

3159
02:37:20,811 --> 02:37:21,644
doing it,
I'm deciding like a smile on my face 

3160
02:37:23,391 --> 02:37:24,720
doing it.
What year is such a great

3161
02:37:24,780 --> 02:37:25,710
talker?
I mean,

3162
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:28,980
remember the first time you did my 
podcast even before mediator,

3163
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:30,690
when you were just coming off of the 
wild.

3164
02:37:30,691 --> 02:37:31,660
Within.
What is it?

3165
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:32,710
Is that what it's called?
Yeah,

3166
02:37:33,270 --> 02:37:34,103
and I remember thinking,
why does this guy have a fucking 

3167
02:37:35,851 --> 02:37:37,830
podcast?
And this is how many years ago,

3168
02:37:37,831 --> 02:37:39,180
seven years ago,
something like that.

3169
02:37:39,230 --> 02:37:41,600
Do you know the first time I ever heard 
the word podcast?

3170
02:37:41,601 --> 02:37:42,710
This is good.
This is embarrassing.

3171
02:37:42,830 --> 02:37:43,663
The first time I ever heard the word 
podcast was Helen Cho telling me that I 

3172
02:37:47,691 --> 02:37:50,420
should go on Joe Rogan's podcast and I 
didn't know what it meant.

3173
02:37:51,290 --> 02:37:52,650
That's how early you were into this 
shit,

3174
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:56,190
into this shit before I ever heard the 
word.

3175
02:37:56,250 --> 02:37:57,630
Wow,
that's crazy.

3176
02:37:57,780 --> 02:37:58,640
Um,
I want,

3177
02:37:58,710 --> 02:37:59,543
I can,
I kind of doubled back around and plug 

3178
02:38:00,301 --> 02:38:01,021
my book again.
Yeah,

3179
02:38:01,021 --> 02:38:01,771
please do.
Okay.

3180
02:38:01,771 --> 02:38:04,590
So it's called the meat eater,
fishing game,

3181
02:38:04,591 --> 02:38:05,424
cookbook,
recipes and techniques for every hunter 

3182
02:38:07,231 --> 02:38:08,610
and Angler.
Got a picture of that,

3183
02:38:08,611 --> 02:38:11,070
Jamie,
a Bam.

3184
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:13,130
There it is.
I say one last quick thing about it.

3185
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:16,440
It releases right now,
releases this week on November 20,

3186
02:38:16,441 --> 02:38:19,310
but it's available for preorder 
everywhere and it's um,

3187
02:38:19,530 --> 02:38:23,970
broken into a bunch of chapters where it
has big game,

3188
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:28,110
small game like rabbits,
hares,

3189
02:38:28,111 --> 02:38:29,760
squirrels,
upland birds,

3190
02:38:29,761 --> 02:38:31,620
waterfowl,
fresh water or salt water,

3191
02:38:31,621 --> 02:38:32,101
fish,
Shell,

3192
02:38:32,101 --> 02:38:35,250
fish and crustaceans,
reptiles and amphibians.

3193
02:38:35,251 --> 02:38:38,430
So all your bullfrog stuff is in there 
and you want to talk about a species.

3194
02:38:38,431 --> 02:38:41,160
It's spreading all across the country.
Bull 60.

3195
02:38:41,730 --> 02:38:42,361
Really?
Yeah,

3196
02:38:42,361 --> 02:38:45,630
I've hunted a lot of bullfrogs and 
places where they're very unwelcome.

3197
02:38:46,140 --> 02:38:47,730
What do you hunt them with?
Um,

3198
02:38:47,830 --> 02:38:49,410
a variety of ways.
Most of your frog Gig,

3199
02:38:50,430 --> 02:38:51,263
I don't care where you live,
like there's a lot of people that live 

3200
02:38:52,651 --> 02:38:53,221
in a city.
Like,

3201
02:38:53,221 --> 02:38:54,054
dude,
I'd love to go out and get some wild 

3202
02:38:54,391 --> 02:38:55,630
game.
I can't read the elk.

3203
02:38:55,631 --> 02:38:56,341
I,
how do I do that?

3204
02:38:56,341 --> 02:38:58,770
You could be out gigging frogs at night,
no one would even know

3205
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:04,060
frog gigging crayfish grab and we talked
about all this kind of stuff in the book

3206
02:39:04,300 --> 02:39:05,133
so it explains everything from how to 
like break down and process and freeze 

3207
02:39:10,420 --> 02:39:11,253
stuff.
And then for everything there are many 

3208
02:39:12,581 --> 02:39:15,190
recipes and the recipes walk you through
how to use the entire thing.

3209
02:39:15,191 --> 02:39:17,710
So are you from for refer your white 
tail deer.

3210
02:39:18,070 --> 02:39:21,850
Everything from the tongue to the rear 
shank,

3211
02:39:23,450 --> 02:39:26,780
how like specific recipes on how to do 
it.

3212
02:39:27,230 --> 02:39:28,480
And also,
um,

3213
02:39:29,210 --> 02:39:30,043
just general best practices and 
guidelines around how to handle the 

3214
02:39:32,661 --> 02:39:36,050
ingredients and then all the stuff 
around all the substitutions.

3215
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:39,350
So there's no such thing as an elkhart 
recipe.

3216
02:39:39,351 --> 02:39:41,750
Riots like how to like handle game 
hearts,

3217
02:39:41,751 --> 02:39:43,070
whether it's meal deer,
white tail,

3218
02:39:43,071 --> 02:39:45,670
whatever,
like how to approach a heart and a in a,

3219
02:39:45,890 --> 02:39:48,950
in an attitude toward wild game that is 
not,

3220
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:52,160
that's cut specific.
Not Species specific.

3221
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:55,370
And with fish too,
like I don't,

3222
02:39:55,460 --> 02:39:58,130
I'm not with the idea of those is a 
walleye recipe here.

3223
02:39:58,131 --> 02:39:58,964
This is a bluegill recipe,
but how to handle like varieties of 

3224
02:40:02,001 --> 02:40:03,680
fresh water,
fish and like what kind of,

3225
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:04,603
what kind of recipes you can use that 
are interchangeable depending on where 

3226
02:40:08,211 --> 02:40:09,044
you live and what you use and all 
includes all that and the real pretty 

3227
02:40:12,321 --> 02:40:13,620
pictures.
Beautiful.

3228
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:17,400
You can see Yonis Patellas how to do the
tail skinning Methadone Squirrel.

3229
02:40:17,850 --> 02:40:19,200
And I don't care where you live.
You damn sure.

3230
02:40:19,201 --> 02:40:21,530
Live near squirrels.
People.

3231
02:40:21,540 --> 02:40:23,460
Very uncomfortable.
Squirrel eaten,

3232
02:40:24,110 --> 02:40:26,480
not me.
Oh,

3233
02:40:26,490 --> 02:40:27,323
and you know in the end,
the guy that got the disease means girl 

3234
02:40:29,661 --> 02:40:30,494
brains.
Yeah.

3235
02:40:30,540 --> 02:40:32,740
Nothing to do with scroll brains.
Oh No.

3236
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:34,340
The article I sent you.
Yeah.

3237
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:35,280
What,
what did he.

3238
02:40:35,420 --> 02:40:37,050
Everybody sent me that article.
Yeah.

3239
02:40:37,460 --> 02:40:40,080
There's,
there's no demonstrable correlations.

3240
02:40:40,081 --> 02:40:42,660
Like 30 peep,
30 Americans a year,

3241
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:47,600
you know,
wind up with that form of crumps felt 30

3242
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:48,473
Americans wind up with.
It just happens to be this dude's 

3243
02:40:50,271 --> 02:40:53,190
sometime in his past.
It's in some sort of.

3244
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:57,660
It's a are prion disease and it's the 
same thing Hamza people,

3245
02:40:57,661 --> 02:40:58,494
but,
but it was the correlation between his 

3246
02:41:02,341 --> 02:41:05,010
diet and what happened to him was 
implied.

3247
02:41:05,550 --> 02:41:10,350
Implied put possible.
If you go read up on it,

3248
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:13,810
it now seems like people are really 
saying like,

3249
02:41:13,830 --> 02:41:18,420
there's no,
there's no obvious relationship here.

3250
02:41:18,750 --> 02:41:19,583
No obvious relationship between eating 
squirrel brains and getting a prion 

3251
02:41:22,111 --> 02:41:22,944
disease.
Yeah.

3252
02:41:22,950 --> 02:41:23,783
There's plenty of people that get the 
same thing that haven't been eating 

3253
02:41:26,641 --> 02:41:27,590
squirrel brains.
Right.

3254
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:29,243
So just,
they were just looking at the unusual 

3255
02:41:30,151 --> 02:41:32,730
aspects of his diet and pointing to 
that.

3256
02:41:33,090 --> 02:41:34,710
And it's not that scientific.
Yeah.

3257
02:41:34,711 --> 02:41:35,544
And the,
the article got a lot more love when it 

3258
02:41:36,871 --> 02:41:37,704
was at some squirrel hundred died from 
eating squirrel brains than it did when 

3259
02:41:40,021 --> 02:41:42,270
the later subsequent pieces came out.
Wherever it is like,

3260
02:41:42,280 --> 02:41:44,670
whoa.
Yeah,

3261
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:49,380
we don't really like girls are cute.
Yeah.

3262
02:41:49,980 --> 02:41:52,080
I ate some squirrel with you.
Just the thing,

3263
02:41:52,110 --> 02:41:55,620
you've very good.
There's not a person in the world.

3264
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:58,200
You know what we have in the,
in the cookbook is we have um,

3265
02:41:58,290 --> 02:42:00,300
how to do buffalo,
buffalo wings,

3266
02:42:00,301 --> 02:42:01,134
hot wings,
how to do hot legs with squirrels were 

3267
02:42:04,090 --> 02:42:05,550
unit the Arni.
Really?

3268
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:06,473
Yeah.
So it's just like you making rules on 

3269
02:42:07,801 --> 02:42:10,290
shooting squirrels.
Um,

3270
02:42:10,291 --> 02:42:12,000
they vary state by state.
Yeah.

3271
02:42:12,001 --> 02:42:13,620
So if,
if you're in New York,

3272
02:42:13,650 --> 02:42:14,970
you know,
you have a season,

3273
02:42:15,020 --> 02:42:16,070
um,
you know,

3274
02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:19,290
squirrel season in most states,
so it's either,

3275
02:42:19,360 --> 02:42:20,193
it's either one or the other way,
either there's a season in a bag limit 

3276
02:42:22,230 --> 02:42:26,700
or the treated as a non game species.
So here in California there's a squirrel

3277
02:42:26,701 --> 02:42:28,170
season.
It was a bag of,

3278
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:30,720
I think it's for a day for four 
squirrels a day.

3279
02:42:30,810 --> 02:42:32,070
When's the season?
You know,

3280
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:34,440
seasons usually run from sometime in 
August,

3281
02:42:34,460 --> 02:42:38,160
in September into winter,
into January,

3282
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:40,890
February.
So where I grew up September 15th,

3283
02:42:41,910 --> 02:42:45,330
September eighth to January,
27th.

3284
02:42:45,390 --> 02:42:48,500
Archery.
Falconry only Jesus crest.

3285
02:42:48,510 --> 02:42:50,300
So archery and foul,
foul Kinnari.

3286
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:54,510
So August four for archery and falconry.
Falconry falcons.

3287
02:42:54,511 --> 02:42:56,250
Then you got to go to the tree squirrels
zone map,

3288
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:57,563
right?
But in your estate Jack rabbits are 

3289
02:42:58,891 --> 02:42:59,790
open.
For instance,

3290
02:42:59,791 --> 02:43:02,400
your State Jack Rabbits are managed as 
non gaming.

3291
02:43:02,401 --> 02:43:05,010
There's no bag limit in open year round 
snow,

3292
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:05,873
like a cottontails.
No issues have different management and 

3293
02:43:08,541 --> 02:43:10,530
a lot of states pine squirrels are red 
squirrels,

3294
02:43:10,531 --> 02:43:11,830
which aren't commonly hunted,

3295
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:15,010
but they're more regarded as like things
that get into people's houses,

3296
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:18,790
but they're not 100 for me,
they'd be listed as a non game species,

3297
02:43:18,791 --> 02:43:21,550
but Fox girls and gray squirrels,
v as game species.

3298
02:43:21,551 --> 02:43:22,384
So in New York,
I think the bag limit when I was living 

3299
02:43:24,221 --> 02:43:28,540
there was six per day,
a possession limit of two bag limits.

3300
02:43:28,570 --> 02:43:30,330
Did you shoot any squirrels in Brooklyn 
and need them?

3301
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:31,420
No.
No,

3302
02:43:31,880 --> 02:43:32,713
when I caught some there and ate them,
but I would hunt out of the city at my 

3303
02:43:36,851 --> 02:43:41,770
buddy's farm and some other places.
So where I was born in Michigan,

3304
02:43:41,980 --> 02:43:42,813
the squirrel season was September 15th 
and it ran into a van to January five 

3305
02:43:47,801 --> 02:43:50,260
squirrels a day.
Possession limit of two bag limits.

3306
02:43:50,530 --> 02:43:55,120
The state I live in now treat squirrels 
as non game species.

3307
02:43:55,121 --> 02:43:55,954
So there's no close season,
no bag limit because there's not really 

3308
02:43:58,931 --> 02:44:00,370
a,
there's not a,

3309
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:03,340
they're not widely distributed and 
they're not commonly haunted.

3310
02:44:04,860 --> 02:44:07,000
All right.
But uh,

3311
02:44:07,170 --> 02:44:08,003
yeah,
most places they have them and they're 

3312
02:44:09,870 --> 02:44:10,703
managed.
And you go out and buy a small game 

3313
02:44:11,551 --> 02:44:14,160
license for 12 bucks or whatever.
Get your hunter safety,

3314
02:44:14,610 --> 02:44:15,443
get yourself a 22 or a or a shotgun.
And you can become a squirrel man or a 

3315
02:44:19,980 --> 02:44:21,900
squirrel lady like you buddy.
Kevin Murphy,

3316
02:44:22,360 --> 02:44:25,230
one of my favorite guys on your podcast.
He's a squirrel man.

3317
02:44:25,231 --> 02:44:26,064
This guy blows a horn in the woods 
before every hunt to alert the animals 

3318
02:44:31,381 --> 02:44:32,530
that he's coming.
Yeah.

3319
02:44:33,480 --> 02:44:34,670
You blow.
Yeah.

3320
02:44:34,700 --> 02:44:38,690
He carries a cow horn around the,
I think um,

3321
02:44:38,770 --> 02:44:40,280
it's in,
uh,

3322
02:44:41,460 --> 02:44:42,720
a show far,
right?

3323
02:44:42,780 --> 02:44:43,680
Is that right?
For.

3324
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:48,080
And when you blow the Shofar and like a 
Jewish synagogue,

3325
02:44:48,230 --> 02:44:49,680
is that what it is?
Thanks.

3326
02:44:49,770 --> 02:44:51,320
Called a chauffeur.
Like you've blown the rams.

3327
02:44:51,350 --> 02:44:52,880
They below a Ram's horn.
It's not,

3328
02:44:52,910 --> 02:44:54,530
it's not a cow,
a cow harm.

3329
02:44:54,531 --> 02:44:55,650
It's ran,
you know,

3330
02:44:55,651 --> 02:44:57,860
the end of um,
you know,

3331
02:44:57,861 --> 02:45:00,160
in the end have no country for old men.
Yeah.

3332
02:45:02,060 --> 02:45:02,893
Have we talked about this before?
He talks about his father riding out 

3333
02:45:06,561 --> 02:45:08,870
ahead of him or the Horn of fire

3334
02:45:10,550 --> 02:45:12,320
in the end when you get,
he relates the dream.

3335
02:45:12,321 --> 02:45:13,154
It's in the book and it's in the movie 
for the Tommy Lee Jones characters 

3336
02:45:15,680 --> 02:45:16,513
describing a dream in which they're 
riding through a snow storm and his 

3337
02:45:18,711 --> 02:45:19,544
father rides ahead with a Horn of fire.
And I was wondering how many people 

3338
02:45:22,251 --> 02:45:26,960
heard that and had no idea what he was 
talking about.

3339
02:45:27,470 --> 02:45:32,120
But what a common practice used to be as
you take a horn buffalo horn,

3340
02:45:32,121 --> 02:45:34,040
cow horn.
And it's hollow because,

3341
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:35,273
um,
it grows off of protrusion of the skull 

3342
02:45:37,430 --> 02:45:38,263
called the horn core.
And you pop the horn off and it's 

3343
02:45:40,161 --> 02:45:42,230
hollow.
And what people will do is when you left

3344
02:45:42,231 --> 02:45:46,790
your campfire in the morning,
you would fill that horn with embers and

3345
02:45:46,791 --> 02:45:47,624
cap it,
but there'd be a little pinhole in it 

3346
02:45:49,250 --> 02:45:52,130
just to let a little bit of air and air 
so it could continue to smolder.

3347
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:54,950
And you carry that Horn all day full of 
embers.

3348
02:45:55,310 --> 02:45:59,540
And at night to start a new fire,
you would dump the horn out and rekindle

3349
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:02,150
your fire.
So when he talks about his father riding

3350
02:46:02,151 --> 02:46:06,740
out ahead of them with a Horn of fire,
what that's meant to say is that he knew

3351
02:46:06,741 --> 02:46:10,040
his father will be waiting out ahead of 
with

3352
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:11,990
a fire burning.
Whoa.

3353
02:46:12,410 --> 02:46:14,360
Yeah.
But Kevin Murray just blows it.

3354
02:46:14,361 --> 02:46:15,400
Let squirrels.
Noise worries.

3355
02:46:18,470 --> 02:46:19,303
Thanks for coming,
man.

3356
02:46:19,550 --> 02:46:20,383
Always good to talk to you.
We keep saying we've got to organize 

3357
02:46:22,281 --> 02:46:23,720
another hunt.
We have to give the love.

3358
02:46:23,790 --> 02:46:26,420
You have to do something.
Call Brian Cowen.

3359
02:46:27,560 --> 02:46:29,240
I talked to him recently.
We'll make it happen.

3360
02:46:29,630 --> 02:46:31,280
He's one of the phone.
Your guys on Instagram,
