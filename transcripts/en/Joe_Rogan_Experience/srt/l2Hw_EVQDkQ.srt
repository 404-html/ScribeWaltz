1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,820
So sweat this dude,

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,540
this guy,

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,350
the EPA is highest paid employee in
a leading expert in climate change,

5
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:11,550
deserves to go to prison for at least
30 months for lying to his bosses and

6
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:16,470
saying that he was a CIA spy working in
Pakistan so that he could avoid doing

7
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:17,430
his real job,

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,290
says the federal prosecutors.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,910
So the dude was,

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,140
how slick is this cat?

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,310
He tells his people at the fucking he,

12
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:26,144
he goes,

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,600
he's works for the EPA,

14
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,400
the highest paid climate expert,

15
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,271
and they go,

16
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:30,391
well,

17
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:31,830
we want you to do a lot of
studies on climate change.

18
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:31,980
Like,

19
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,400
listen,

20
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,233
I would love to,

21
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,350
I work for the CIA protecting America.

22
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:37,951
Meanwhile,

23
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:38,820
he was just making it up,

24
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,160
but he did it for the longest time.

25
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,950
Like this guy built them out
of $1 million over a decade.

26
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,360
I say more power to them.

27
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,410
There's a grift in the system.

28
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,010
Fuck him.

29
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,843
Use it.

30
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,811
Well again,

31
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:52,080
it's like it's more in
competence than it is anything.

32
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,600
It's more human Horesh behavior.

33
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,430
It's greed than it is anything.

34
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,220
That's guys that work example
that I have to work for.

35
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,000
The CIA.

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,870
What can I tell you?

37
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,580
Cause you imagine the answer town halls,

38
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,930
you have to just invent
that you're a CIA operative.

39
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,970
How many fake CIA operatives out there?

40
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:11,580
Like dudes are trying to
impress chicks and it's amazing,

41
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,570
especially with homeland,

42
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:13,800
it's probably jumped up quite a bit.

43
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,790
Can you prove to us that you're seeing,

44
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,890
I would love to,

45
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,580
but it's top secret
would have to have you.

46
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,310
You would have to be sequestered.

47
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,543
That's the thing.

48
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:21,841
Look,

49
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,674
I can't,

50
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,460
I'm working for the,

51
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,050
I'm trying to save America.

52
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:26,890
I know.

53
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,010
It looks like I'm on
Facebook 23 hours a day.

54
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:29,844
But uh,

55
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,031
yeah,

56
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,380
they check his cell phone and like,

57
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:31,550
dude,

58
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,090
your texting like 20 different chicks.

59
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:33,811
What's going on man?

60
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:35,490
You were really working on climate change.

61
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,200
It was just getting mad cash.

62
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:38,310
Just bawling every night.

63
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,160
Going to strip clubs for
all parties of his house.

64
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:41,940
Uh,

65
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,750
it's a lot of youporn but you porn is
actually a front for a CIA websites.

66
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,710
So we're making sure that
the really dark stuff does.

67
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,310
I watched the,

68
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,790
you know,

69
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,180
the Aina,

70
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,620
we have to allow a certain amount.

71
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,700
I am horrified by the gaping but
we have to allow a certain amount.

72
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,660
If we don't allow it,

73
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,660
it's then we're going to lose a lot of
the people that would be with us against

74
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:01,100
this child.

75
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,220
My job to measure the diameter of the
gate because if it gets beyond a certain

76
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,030
point,

77
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,340
if we start getting ostrich like
we've got to cancel the program.

78
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,850
If I was poor and starving I would and
some guy's driving a car worth 250 grand.

79
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,870
I would take it they tore and
starving or are they just pour?

80
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,460
I would be,

81
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:20,780
I wouldn't,

82
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,720
I wouldn't be starving.

83
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:21,841
Yeah,

84
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,100
you'd have to be starving a lot.

85
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,360
Most people are just poor.

86
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,760
The poor and starving
number's pretty small.

87
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:30,220
I think I wouldn't take it but I would
definitely take a shit on your hood cause

88
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,690
I,

89
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,390
I just want to fuck your shit
up but I don't want to steal.

90
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,560
Why be a hater like that?

91
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,790
Why shouldn't I Mansa the guy works so
hard to get a nice car and he decides to

92
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,720
keep it in the neighborhood.

93
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,520
And what do you do your shit on it or
brings me no enjoyment but my shit on that

94
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:48,060
hood is brings oh well that's cause
you got to hate her mentality.

95
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,030
He should give you enjoyment
because she should give you hope.

96
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,680
You should look at that and say look,

97
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,060
this asshole can make that money.

98
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,360
What's,

99
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,260
why is he better than me?

100
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:55,980
He's not.

101
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,240
So this is inspiration.

102
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,320
Use it for fuel.

103
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,380
Go on and get your own car.

104
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,323
No

105
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,260
car.

106
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,250
All you're going to think about is,

107
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:03,481
man,

108
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:05,950
I hope I don't have a car like this is
some asshole like me is going to come

109
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,760
along and shit on it.

110
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:06,970
No.

111
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,120
Would be like I can't wait until the day
there's some asshole like me that shits

112
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:12,000
on my car when I had the
cause when you have that,

113
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm glad you mad,

114
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,543
mad,

115
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,950
mad enough that someone
steps on your hood,

116
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,110
dense your fucking hood
in and shits on it.

117
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,430
That is just rude,

118
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:26,431
disrespectful property and you can't sell
that anytime a kid in America and when

119
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,231
I buy a car nut,

120
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:29,710
I'm just going to expect that someone,

121
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,060
when they will shit on this hood,

122
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,571
they like the,

123
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,680
I listen to Joe Rogan,

124
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,270
I'm going to go find
his car and shit on him.

125
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,750
Oh,

126
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,010
that is so rude.

127
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,700
Leave you put that out there because
it's going to come back and it's going to

128
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,680
land right in your fucking dashboard.

129
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,680
Someone's going to take your
windshield out video now,

130
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,450
but shit,

131
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,570
they got to punch a hole straight
three dashboard or through or through

132
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,190
windshield so they can shit
directly onto your dashboard.

133
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,870
How dare you?

134
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,730
How dare you even think
like that for decker,

135
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,520
sunroof,

136
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,280
Shin.

137
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,720
Even the more pro move.

138
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,071
Yeah,

139
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:58,261
it.

140
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:58,541
Well,

141
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:58,961
it really,

142
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:00,130
if you want to shit in your own hand,

143
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,310
then smear it in that upper part
where you can never clean it out.

144
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,230
That's what I'm saying.

145
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,150
If you want to really fuck up a guy's car,

146
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,260
but why would you do then
man entered the runny,

147
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,210
that's bad energy.

148
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,210
You till you're doing well.

149
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,260
You don't need to do this.

150
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,550
You're a successful man.

151
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,770
It can't be hating on
some dude with a Bentley.

152
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,880
This is ridiculous.

153
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,020
It's a shitty car.

154
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,280
It's gonna break down in them anyway.

155
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,140
It's going to leave them
on the side of the highway.

156
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,510
I've got a friend who has a Rolls Royce.

157
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,673
It breaks,

158
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,413
breaks,

159
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,830
breaks all the time.

160
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,880
Things go wrong,

161
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,360
AC gets stuck on this
fucking thing goes wrong.

162
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,770
Radio doesn't work.

163
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,030
This speakers out,

164
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,240
it's a fucking Rolls Royce
and it doesn't make sense.

165
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,313
The brakes,

166
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,970
the brakes come by like,

167
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,620
you know on Lincoln you can
buy these sort of old like,

168
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:45,880
you know,

169
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,571
Shit Brown,

170
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:51,070
seventies rollers for like five grand
and every time I go to Vegas I'm like,

171
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,990
I'm going to come back with a brick or
two and just buy a shit brown roller and

172
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:59,830
get like a punk kid with a safety pin
through his neck or [inaudible] kid to

173
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,240
just drive me around town.

174
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,870
We're all up to the
bars and my Shit Brown,

175
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,640
77 Rolls Royce and be like,

176
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,510
I am I late for the party and you know,

177
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,530
and just have this kid,

178
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,430
you know,

179
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,900
facial tattoos be my driver.

180
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,100
That's not a bad move.

181
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,540
It's make people uncomfortable.

182
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,040
And that wasn't shit on that hood.

183
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,060
If that kid was driving,

184
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,730
you would let that slide like live.

185
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,540
Well you wouldn't shit on the hood of
a 77 year old car and then 1977 car.

186
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,374
Anyway,

187
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:26,891
that car,

188
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,000
I would respect that whip.

189
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,000
I think I'm going to go to
track suits and fanny packs.

190
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,080
I'll do it.

191
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,400
I think I'm going to commit,

192
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,470
I'm for the tracks.

193
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,290
Track suit and fanny pack
is my new look for life.

194
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:38,831
I think,

195
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:39,280
uh,

196
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,690
my body will appreciate it.

197
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,460
It's very light relaxing.

198
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,070
Let's find some good tracksuits Brian
and change that to our new wardrobe.

199
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,160
Show you the ones that I
want to live in California,

200
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:48,420
man.

201
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,720
Or you need to wear thermals and
shed on need layers of goose down.

202
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,980
I can get by with a track
suit and a fanny pack.

203
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,073
I want to be put,

204
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,140
I want to be part of your crew.

205
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,430
I don't feel like it started own tracks.

206
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,670
What kind of sneakers should we where we
definitely gotta wear Pumas are Adidas

207
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,733
I'm saying.

208
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:03,550
Yeah,

209
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,820
whatever the track suit is.

210
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,580
Here's the shoes that a six dozer.

211
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,051
Good.

212
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,620
That's a good choice Brian.

213
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,641
That's a good choice.

214
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,930
That's a comfortable shoe too.

215
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,350
Yup.

216
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,170
And if you're wearing like a blue
track suit with some white stripes,

217
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:16,010
that will fit nicely.

218
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,690
If we learn anything from fat James,

219
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,460
it's tracksuits and a six.

220
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,720
No doubt about it.

221
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,741
Rest in peace.

222
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,574
Fred James.

223
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,331
Yeah.

224
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,530
Tracksuits and [inaudible].

225
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,220
I haven't had a track suit since I was
probably 19 was the last time you had an

226
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,200
actual legit traction?

227
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,950
I got one when I was
like 28 cause one of the,

228
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,660
I was going out with this girl.

229
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,570
I want her to try to pull it off
like we're talking about now.

230
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,610
Yeah,

231
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,910
she worked at a echo.

232
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,060
Do you know that that Mark
Echo that clothing line.

233
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,490
She worked there and I'm like give
me one of these tracksuits right.

234
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:45,950
And I tried it for like a week
and I just couldn't keep it up,

235
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,323
you know,

236
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,340
track suit.

237
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,390
I couldn't commit because,

238
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:50,931
put it that way.

239
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,764
I didn't have a crew.

240
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,570
Yeah,

241
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:52,880
ever.

242
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,810
Readies weren't ready yet.

243
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,260
You gotta have some other people around
you that also work so everybody doesn't

244
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:58,160
give a fuck together,

245
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:58,791
you know,

246
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,610
because it's just you on your own
out there in the wilderness of life,

247
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:05,090
being judged by your fashion choices
anywhere to fucking tracksuit.

248
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,610
And you see a girl outside
of a place where a girl,

249
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:08,600
if you were dressed like this,

250
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,020
she'd be like,

251
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,853
Oh,

252
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:09,981
oh,

253
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:10,780
your mat fold tron,

254
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,570
standup comedian.

255
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,820
But she sees you and why are
you wearing a track suit?

256
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,041
The,

257
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:15,290
yeah.

258
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,411
Well,

259
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:15,621
you know,

260
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:19,370
I just like being casual and
I like dressing like a moron.

261
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,091
Is it?

262
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,220
They don't buy that and moron.

263
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:21,770
They don't buy it.

264
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,510
Is it a more on thing or
is it a comfortable thing?

265
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,220
Are we the morons full charge?

266
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:30,221
I know I'm the moron with our
zippers to get our dicks are belts.

267
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,000
When we could just have
a simple drawstring,

268
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,290
easy access.

269
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,110
We've got to start smoking cigars too.

270
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,440
Let's do it.

271
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,790
It's a little old back.

272
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,110
A little bit of organized crime.

273
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,130
Bruce Lee,

274
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,180
Bruce Lee on that type of track suit
the same way Hitler on the mustache.

275
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,033
Yeah.

276
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,220
You can't wear that without people
thinking that you're Bruce Lee,

277
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:48,971
Bruce Lee,

278
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:51,740
and her many more people than
him to see like this one.

279
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,220
Nothing.

280
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,570
You could wear that no problem.

281
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,950
But that game of death one,

282
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,430
no,

283
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,330
Bruce Lee owns that.

284
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,661
That's,

285
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:57,440
that's his.

286
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,071
You can't wear that.

287
00:07:58,071 --> 00:07:59,240
You can't wear a yellow jumpsuit.

288
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,090
It'd be embarrassing to wear a jumpsuit
and like a break dance competition

289
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,830
breaks out and then you got nothing.

290
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:04,664
You get nothing.

291
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,870
You're just kind of inching away quietly.

292
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,010
Oh.
