1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,803
Huh

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,450
that quickly to one.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,730
Boom.
And we're alive.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,570
Mr Polin,
how are you?

5
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,970
Pay Good.
Good to be here this two way.

6
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:11,900
There you go.
Okay.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,130
What's happening man?
How are you?

8
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,620
Good.
Good to be in la.

9
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,400
Uh,
good to have you here.

10
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,350
I've been a fan of your work for a long 
time man.

11
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,213
And I got really excited when I found 
out that you were writing a book on 

12
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:23,710
psychedelics and uh,
um,

13
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,650
I'm just,
uh,

14
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,680
I think it's a,
an amazing subject and I'm,

15
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:30,480
I'm glad someone who's respected 
yourself is getting it.

16
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,210
It's a crackpot subject,
right?

17
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:33,950
It's one of those subjects you're like,
oh no.

18
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,500
Michael Pollan found drugs.
Like what's he doing?

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,250
He's having a crisis and you know,
doing mushrooms,

20
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:41,084
it is a bit of a departure.
I think that there are people who are 

21
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:44,960
expecting another book on food or 
agriculture.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,420
We're a little surprised.
Um,

23
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,250
but so far people have been following 
me.

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,560
You know,
who cared about food and ag and there,

25
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,870
there's more overlap than I ever would 
have guessed.

26
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,763
I think you caught the perfect wave.
I think your book is coming out right 

27
00:00:58,071 --> 00:00:58,904
when John Hopkins research centers 
starting to put out these studies on it 

28
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,604
and people are starting to recognize it.
MTMA has amazing results for 

29
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,640
posttraumatic stress disorder from 
veterans and marijuana is becoming legal

30
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:13,460
in more and more states.
It's like you're catching this wave.

31
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,200
And I didn't know that.
I,

32
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:16,034
you know,
you never know where the culture is 

33
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:18,830
going to be.
Cause you started book years before.

34
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,600
How long did you start it?
Well,

35
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,390
I started the research in,
uh,

36
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,293
2014.
I wrote a piece for the New Yorker 

37
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,180
called the trip treatment,
uh,

38
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:27,420
which is online.
Um,

39
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,440
and it was my first foray into this 
work.

40
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:33,890
I went down to Hopkins.
It's been a lot of time at Nyu.

41
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,910
And at the time they were doing this 
really interesting trial where they were

42
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:40,610
giving psilocybin to people with cancer 
diagnoses,

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,713
many of whom were terminal.
And that seemed like such a weird idea 

44
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:46,370
to me that I,
I was curious to explore it.

45
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,860
And I spent a lot of time talking to 
patients,

46
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,750
many of whom were dying,
uh,

47
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,584
about how this single high dose silicide
been experience a guided silicide and 

48
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,923
experience.
And we should talk a little bit about 

49
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:00,580
how the guided changes things for,
you know,

50
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:03,620
it's not the image people have is 
popping some mushrooms in your mouth and

51
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:05,360
maybe go to a concert or going to the 
beach.

52
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:08,870
But this is a very controlled internal 
experience,

53
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,470
uh,
completely reset these people's attitude

54
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:15,680
toward death and it allowed them to die 
with equanimity.

55
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,550
And,
um,

56
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,610
uh,
and when these results were published,

57
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,560
um,
just last year,

58
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,830
they found that,
um,

59
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,390
that in 80% of the people who had the 
session,

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,593
uh,
they had statistically significant 

61
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:32,000
reductions in standard measures of 
depression and anxiety.

62
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,133
It was one of the most effective 
psychiatric interventions that the 

63
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:38,810
psychiatrist had ever seen.
A,

64
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:40,760
which is amazing,
a single experience.

65
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,570
And then a molecule could change the 
contents of your head to the,

66
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:47,810
to the extent that you would rethink 
your mortality.

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,753
Uh,
and so as I began talking to these 

68
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:54,320
people and hearing their stories,
many of which were just remarkable,

69
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,790
I realized,
you know,

70
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,700
this is not just an article.
There's a book here and there's,

71
00:02:58,701 --> 00:02:59,920
so,
you know,

72
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,990
there are two kinds of articles you 
write as a journalist.

73
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:06,220
One is you f you,
you're sick of the topic by the time you

74
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,560
finished and you can't wait to be done.
And the other is,

75
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,360
God,
I just scratched the surface.

76
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,583
And this was one of those.
Did you have any experiences personally 

77
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,200
with psychedelics before you wrote this?
Very Limited,

78
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,160
um,
I,

79
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,700
for some peculiar reason,
never did psychedelics in college.

80
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,920
They just weren't around.
I went into the round,

81
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,823
no,
I went to the wrong school and I was 

82
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,770
like a very kind of progressive hippie 
school.

83
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:32,710
I went to Bennington college in Vermont 
and there were,

84
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,800
there was lsd there before me and there 
was lsd after me.

85
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:39,070
But I was in this little wrinkle in time
where there was only alcohol.

86
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,460
I need a cut there guys.
Thanks Jamie.

87
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,890
Crazy only alcohol in college and I 
hadn't,

88
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,140
so I had no experience of psychedelics.
Uh,

89
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,500
until I was in my late twenties,
and then it was,

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,270
um,
pretty mild.

91
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,430
I had a couple of mushroom experiences 
that would,

92
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,400
I now describe as the aesthetic 
experiences,

93
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,110
right.
Once small doses,

94
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,720
they were,
yeah.

95
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:01,800
I don't,
I never measured,

96
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:05,080
it was probably one gram,
so I'd never had a big trip.

97
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,100
And,
um,

98
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,963
and there was another reason I was,
I didn't feel psychologically sturdy 

99
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:13,000
enough and I came of age just when the,
the,

100
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,900
the scare stories about psychedelics 
were everywhere in the culture.

101
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,760
You know,
they would scramble your chromosomes,

102
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,040
you'd stare at the sun until you went 
blind.

103
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,810
Um,
you know,

104
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,644
the person who took all the orange 
sunshine and thought he was an orange 

105
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,310
for the rest of his life,
you know,

106
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,190
these stories are out there.
And I was afraid to,

107
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,230
I was just afraid.
Yeah.

108
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,530
Well that's,
it's,

109
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,690
it's not an unfounded fear.
Oh No,

110
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,051
I'm,
no,

111
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:40,210
people can really get into psychological
trouble.

112
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,780
I think it's really important that 
people understand that a,

113
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:45,460
it's a,
it's a profound,

114
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,310
powerful,
destabilizing experience.

115
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,593
And depending on your mindset and your,
and the situation in which you take it 

116
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:58,000
set and setting,
it can be I'm ecstatic or horrific.

117
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,890
And um,
and you know,

118
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,724
there are many people who had a series 
of very good trips and then they have 

119
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:04,930
that one bad trip.
And uh,

120
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,183
so yeah,
I and I had heard enough stories about 

121
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,670
that,
um,

122
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,320
to,
to stay away.

123
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,400
Uh,
so,

124
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,860
so discovering this kind of later in 
life,

125
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,940
uh,
you know,

126
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:19,150
I was certainly not something I planned 
on or expected.

127
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,260
It's a

128
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,093
great tragedy and in my opinion that our
culture has demonized these substances 

129
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:30,330
and put them in this category of 
forbidden fruit to the point where you,

130
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,340
you,
you're so nervous about doing them,

131
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,323
you have to get him from some shady 
character and you don't know where 

132
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,121
you're getting.
Yeah.

133
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,980
You have to do them in the,
you know,

134
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,200
in secrecy you have to be really 
careful.

135
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,483
But we also at the same time are aware 
of all these incredibly positive 

136
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,534
benefits from them.
And then if we just had professional 

137
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:49,774
places where we could go to and when we 
have these rehab facilities that are 

138
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:53,794
available for people trying to kick 
opiates and people trying to get their 

139
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:56,734
life together.
But if we had something similar like a 

140
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,744
psychedelic facility with registered 
professionals who understand this and 

141
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,444
who could evaluate you psychologically 
understand if you're perhaps taking 

142
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,010
medication that would adversely affect 
your trip,

143
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,890
try to find out who you are,
like where,

144
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:17,840
what state you're at in your life.
Have you had any experiences before?

145
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,530
Maybe you should put you on a low dose,
right?

146
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,843
Hold up slowly.
Let's try something small and see how 

147
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:27,350
you react to it.
And then I think,

148
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,603
I don't think people like myself or pot 
smokers or people who've done 

149
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,070
psychedelics,
I don't think we do it any favors either

150
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:34,904
because we're always trying to pretend 
that there is no adverse effects and 

151
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,750
that there's like,
you know,

152
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:40,790
people,
when they get into something,

153
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,624
they want everybody to do it.
And I've been guilty of this myself and 

154
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,374
people tell us

155
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,390
there's a,
there's a occupational hazard of a,

156
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,570
of a irrational exuberance.
And you know,

157
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,220
this is what happened to Timothy Leary,
right?

158
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,103
I mean,
people have an amazing experience and 

159
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,750
the first thing they think is 
everybody's got to do this.

160
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,750
But it isn't for everybody.
And I think you're absolutely right.

161
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,460
I think that,
look,

162
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,070
there are risks,
but these are not drugs of abuse,

163
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,600
right?
They're nonaddictive,

164
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,463
they're anti addictive.
The first thought after having a big 

165
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,210
psychedelic trip is not,
when can I do this again?

166
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,063
Right?

167
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,130
Any,
whoa.

168
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,510
The last one I had,
I was like,

169
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,560
I don't know if I could do that again.

170
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,613
Yeah.
I just felt that way every time it's 

171
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:20,780
like childbirth or how,
how we here try childbirth is you'd,

172
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,010
you can't imagine doing it again and 
eventually you do.

173
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,810
You do do it again.
Um,

174
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,580
so I do think that we have to find the 
proper context in which to do it.

175
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:31,680
And I,
I think your point is really important.

176
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,320
We need trained guides.
Um,

177
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,800
the experience is completely different 
when it's guided.

178
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,580
Um,
because you have a sense of safety.

179
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,430
There's someone looking out for your 
body while your mind is traveling.

180
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,690
And this allows you to essentially 
surrender to the experience.

181
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,553
And most bad trips in my experience are 
the result of people resisting what is 

182
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:57,690
happening there.
Ego is dissolving and it's scary.

183
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,524
It feels like a death and they try to 
stop it and that can make you very 

184
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:02,364
anxious.
And so all the guides I worked with and 

185
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,660
interviewed,
they were all like,

186
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,790
relax your mind and float downstream.

187
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,240
If you see a door open it,
if you see a staircase go down.

188
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,320
It,
um,

189
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,380
uh,
surrender trust and let go.

190
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,620
And this kind of advice changes 
everything.

191
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,513
And the chances of a bad trip I think in
a guided situation are substantially 

192
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,404
less because they know how to help you 
deal with it and what to tell you when 

193
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,030
it's happening.
Um,

194
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,460
so I do think that,
um,

195
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,533
by,
by forcing these drugs underground and 

196
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:40,000
into this very kind of unregulated use,
um,

197
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,153
there were not reports of bad trips were
much fewer before the moral panic about 

198
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:50,400
lsd in 1965 and when it was still legal,
um,

199
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,500
you didn't hear about bad trips.
Um,

200
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,363
you started hearing about it when the 
culture did this one and turned against 

201
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,803
a psychedelic.
So I think you can create situations 

202
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:00,450
where the,
the,

203
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,250
the risks are really mitigated.

204
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,573
Well,
I think also the fear like you were 

205
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:06,430
talking about,
right,

206
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:09,400
but for the podcast or right as we 
started,

207
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,333
what some people worried that they were 
going to turn into an orange or think 

208
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:13,534
they're an orange or all those fears.
If you take something and those things 

209
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:17,194
are in the back of your head and your 
that you can literally manifest extreme 

210
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:21,934
anxiety that might not have been there 
if he just relaxed and just had the 

211
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:27,520
experience alone,
you know,

212
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:30,310
a on its own without all the cultural 
hysteria

213
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,830
attached to it or,
or episodes of paranoia.

214
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,540
That's,
that's common too.

215
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,374
So,
but a good guide can work you through 

216
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:37,654
this.
And actually they don't even like the 

217
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:39,754
term bad trip.
They call it a challenging trip because 

218
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,040
often very interesting material comes up
that you then can work on later.

219
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,293
Uh,
it's like having a nightmare and you 

220
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:48,730
know,
analyzing it with your shrink,

221
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:50,890
it actually may be very productive.
Um,

222
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,720
so,
so,

223
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,440
you know,
I,

224
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,273
I was kind of a nervous nelly going into
this and I really looked at the whole 

225
00:09:57,161 --> 00:10:00,400
risk profile and on the,
on the physiological side,

226
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:03,820
your body,
the risks are remarkably low.

227
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,980
And I'm speaking here of the classic 
psychedelics.

228
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:09,670
I'm not talking about Mtma or even pot.
I'm really,

229
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:13,090
I'm talking about LSD silicide man,
which is magic mushrooms.

230
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,450
Um,
DMT Mescalin.

231
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,753
Um,
they are much less toxic than many of 

232
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,710
the over the counter drugs you have in 
your medicine cabinet.

233
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,230
There's no lethal dose,
which is remarkable.

234
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,800
There's one elephant that was killed 
with LSD once.

235
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,290
They wanted to see what it would take 
and it was this,

236
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,363
they gave it a massive dose,
but to get it to the point where they 

237
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:37,264
could administer it,
they had to give it a massive dose of 

238
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:39,154
tranquilizer.
So it isn't actually clear that the LSD 

239
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:43,540
killed it may have been the,
the Benzos or whatever they were given.

240
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,310
I know.
What a horrible thing,

241
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,690
right?
Go online and look up,

242
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,120
uh,
the elephant who died from LSD.

243
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,370
Crazy idea.
Uh,

244
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:54,370
and when Quincy was going through the 
elephants mind before it,

245
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,950
animals don't like psychedelics that 
much.

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,150
Um,
we know that if you,

247
00:10:58,151 --> 00:10:58,984
you know,
that classic set up that drug abuse 

248
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:03,380
researchers use where they put a rat in 
a cage and they had,

249
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,040
there's a lever and they could 
administer cocaine or heroin,

250
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,130
uh,
or they can have lunch and they'll press

251
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:12,980
the cocaine lever till they die.
You put Lsd in that setup,

252
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,650
they press it once and never again.
Well

253
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,410
set up is always screwy,
right,

254
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:23,300
because they really shouldn't be in that
situation and it's not a natural setup.

255
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,330
Like that's been critical.

256
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,230
That's right.
And there somebody in Vancouver,

257
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,690
these really cool rat park experiments.
Yes,

258
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,930
that's what you're referencing.
And um,

259
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,930
basically they thought that this was 
inevitably what happens.

260
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:35,764
But in fact,
if you give a rat a beautiful cage with 

261
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:42,490
some things to play with some other rats
to hang out with some nature,

262
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:44,290
you know,
some shrubs and things,

263
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,750
it will not take the cocaine.
And that interesting.

264
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,110
It tells us that environment has a lot 
to do with drug addiction.

265
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,550
I think for sure with human beings too.
I mean,

266
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,433
oh,
human beings in these really fruitless 

267
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,890
lives that are very,
very frustrating.

268
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,470
I think about the people who came back 
from Vietnam.

269
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:00,940
I mean,
I don't,

270
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:03,820
I don't know if I should say most,
but a very high percentage of,

271
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,580
of the troops in Vietnam were on heroin 
when they were there.

272
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:07,900
They were seemingly addicted.

273
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,680
They were using an all the time and they
got back and only 10% had a problem.

274
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,723
Um,
the others were able to kick it really 

275
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,850
easily.
It's very contextual.

276
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:19,420
It's not all biology,
it's about environment.

277
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,750
Now,
when you were researching this book,

278
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,640
um,
did you,

279
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,650
did you start doing your own personal 
experimentation?

280
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,390
Yeah.
Um,

281
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,830
I had a series of trips for the book.
Um,

282
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,893
I had become,
for a couple of reasons I'd become very 

283
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,170
curious about the people I was 
interviewing,

284
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,423
trying to make sense of how they could 
have these transformative trips on a 

285
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,280
drug,
which seemed implausible to me.

286
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,750
Um,
and,

287
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,673
uh,
I also kind of got jealous of the 

288
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:50,014
experiences they were having.
They were having these big spiritual 

289
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,780
experiences.
And I swear,

290
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,700
I don't think I've ever had a spiritual 
experience.

291
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,380
I'm kind of spiritually retarded 
actually,

292
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,200
or was,
and um,

293
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,693
so I,
I realized at a certain point I had to 

294
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,680
see the experience from inside to 
describe it in a book.

295
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,030
It's also kind of my brand as a writer 
when I wrote about the cattle industry,

296
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:12,580
I bought a steer when I wrote about 
architecture,

297
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:13,414
I built a house.
I like to get my hands dirty and see 

298
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,174
things from inside.
There's a quality of wonder you can 

299
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,860
capture doing something for the first 
time.

300
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,830
So in a way,
the fact I was psychedelically naive,

301
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,470
I saw as a positive because people 
who've,

302
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,423
who really know the territory are not 
going to have quite the same first 

303
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,470
experience that was going to have.
So that was really helpful.

304
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,120
So I,
um,

305
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,310
I did a few things.
I,

306
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,830
I went,
um,

307
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,100
mushroom hunting with Paul stamets.
Has he been on the show out there?

308
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:43,210
Yeah,
he's a very cool guy.

309
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:45,310
He's crazy.
He's totally crazy.

310
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,353
And he took me to a spot where you can 
find the strongest silicide been known 

311
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:52,630
to man that he civic northwest.

312
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,180
It's near the mouth of the Columbia 
River.

313
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,290
Um,
I can't be more specific than that.

314
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,680
Don't,
you know,

315
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,630
people would their mushroom spots.
Yeah.

316
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,493
So,
uh,

317
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,220
we went hunting.
It was like this,

318
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,290
you know,
uh,

319
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,350
for Lauren December weather and uh,
he took me to this place and uh,

320
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,400
we spent a couple days outside looking 
for these mushrooms and we found a salon

321
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,290
Ossipee as your essence,
which he,

322
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,610
he found for the first time and named 
after his son is serious.

323
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,633
Oh Wow.
Who in turn is named after the color of 

324
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:24,424
mushrooms when they're bruised as your,
so there's kind of an institute is 

325
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:29,050
committed to fungus.

326
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,880
He's all in.
He is all in wood fungus.

327
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,030
And I was very excited when we found a 
couple and they're hard.

328
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:39,610
I mean,
I would not recommend do,

329
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,473
do it yourself with psilocybin just 
because it's not like looking for 

330
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:45,720
Chanterelles and morels.
Right.

331
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,580
There are mushrooms that look exactly 
like silicide been that can give you a,

332
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,730
just an agonizing death.
Yeah.

333
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,800
But when you're with Paul stamets,
you feel pretty confident.

334
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:55,940
Right.
And,

335
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,500
uh,
so we found these and,

336
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,270
uh,
he said to me after we'd found them,

337
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,104
we were sitting around the campfire,
we were cooking some dinner outside our 

338
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,960
Yurt.
And,

339
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,850
uh,
he said,

340
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:05,310
yes,
I,

341
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,190
these,
these are almost too strong for me.

342
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,331
I said,
really?

343
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:09,141
Why?
He says,

344
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:09,974
well,
they have a side effect that bothers 

345
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:11,980
some people.
I say,

346
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,390
what's that?
Temporary paralysis.

347
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,880
Oh,
I know why that would bother anybody.

348
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,620
So weird.

349
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,210
Yeah,
I know.

350
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,780
I know.
Piki Piki Oh my God.

351
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,800
I was a little reluctant to take them,
but I,

352
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,000
I,
so I did,

353
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:26,834
I had,
uh,

354
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,200
my first deals I had been experienced 
since my twenties was a,

355
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,140
and at the time I was like 60 or 
approaching 60.

356
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,393
Actually,
I have to be very vague on where all 

357
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,650
these things happened,
when all these things happen.

358
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,110
Um,
uh,

359
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,750
and I had a,
a kind of a wonder,

360
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:44,960
I didn't take a lot of them.
I made a tea and I had a really powerful

361
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:47,450
experience.
It was very much about being in nature.

362
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:48,284
I was at our house.
We have a house in New England that 

363
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:53,600
we've had for many years and I was in my
garden and you know,

364
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,434
I've written a lot about plants and I've
written about plant intelligence and 

365
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:58,520
planet consciousness and things like 
that.

366
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,140
And I've always believed intellectually 
that plants,

367
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,300
domesticated plants are acting on us.

368
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,470
It's,
it's not just,

369
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,790
it's,
it's a two way street.

370
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,860
We change plants,
they change us.

371
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,450
We have been,
um,

372
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,123
uh,
in the same way that say the apple tree 

373
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,290
or the flower is manipulating the B,
making it come,

374
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,650
pay attention to it,
offering it nectar and exchange for it,

375
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,484
picking up pollen on its legs and 
doesn't even realize what it's really 

376
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,054
doing is being tricked by the plant into
pollinating it and caring it's genes 

377
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,110
down the street or around the world.
That's happening to us too.

378
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,120
And plants work on us and I,
it's a slightly trippy idea,

379
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:43,850
but it's just co evolution.
That's how co evolution works.

380
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,400
So in,
during this experience,

381
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,380
I felt that in a way I never had that 
idea became flesh.

382
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,570
And I felt that these plants were kind 
of looking back at me.

383
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,930
Uh,
and that they were very benign.

384
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,853
They had only good intentions,
but that there were more subjectivities 

385
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,160
in my garden than I thought.
You know,

386
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,620
we go through the world thinking we're 
the only thinking subject.

387
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:10,454
Everything else is an object.
One of the things that happens on 

388
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,900
psychedelics is everything becomes,
has,

389
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,030
has life in it,
has consciousness in it.

390
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,090
And that was a powerful and beautiful 
experience.

391
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,943
And so that was my dipping my toes in.
And then after that I sought a guide 

392
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,433
because I was trying to simulate the 
experience I was hearing about at 

393
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,090
Hopkins and,
uh,

394
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,640
Nyu where they were doing these studies,
uh,

395
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,513
not just with the dying,
they were doing it with smokers and 

396
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:38,270
alcoholics and meditators,
all these different groups.

397
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,400
But I didn't qualify to enter into 
those.

398
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:41,234
So I had to go underground.
And one of the things I learned is that 

399
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:48,710
there's this thriving network of 
underground guides all over the country.

400
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,390
I don't know how many there are.
Um,

401
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,410
but they're very professional people.
They're not drug dealers.

402
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,150
There are therapists and some of them 
are trained psychologists or mds in some

403
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:00,984
cases actually.
And they're so convinced of the healing 

404
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,410
value of these medicines that they're 
willing to risk their freedom,

405
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,353
uh,
and their livelihood to work 

406
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:10,854
underground.
So I found my way into this community 

407
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,600
and um,
uh,

408
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:16,434
and,
and interviewed a bunch of people and 

409
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,090
some of them were not the kind of people
you want to trust your mind to.

410
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,983
I mean,
and no doubt there are lots of 

411
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:23,694
charlatans.
Everyone I I interview is pretty 

412
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,543
professional,
but some of them were just a little too 

413
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,920
casual about something I was kind of,
um,

414
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,120
you know,
worried about.

415
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,470
Uh,
there was one guy,

416
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:39,471
I remember this Romanian Psycho naut 
therapist in his seventies,

417
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,310
who,
uh,

418
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:41,971
I said,
well,

419
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,890
what happens if something bad happens?
You know,

420
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:46,080
what if,
what if somebody dies,

421
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,003
you know,
while they're with you getting this 

422
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:48,480
trip?
And he said,

423
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,900
you bury them with all the other people 
and that,

424
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:54,420
that kind of casualness really troubled 
me.

425
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,250
So I didn't work with him.
Um,

426
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,130
but eventually I found people that I,
uh,

427
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:02,970
I trusted and I had a bond with and I 
had some very powerful,

428
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,060
uh,
experiences with them and uh,

429
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,880
that did change me,
uh,

430
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,050
in ways that I'm still kind of,
you know,

431
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,093
digesting

432
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,163
now.
I would like to see you back to the 

433
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,120
garden thing when you're having this 
experience with these plants.

434
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,270
I had a experience once on very high 
dose of marijuana edibles.

435
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,330
I went into a grow room that uh,
this,

436
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,910
uh,
local dispensary had set up.

437
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:29,744
It's just big room filled with plants 
and it was the first time I like when I 

438
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:36,464
walked in,
it's the first time I've ever been 

439
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:40,100
around pot plants where I felt like they
are aware that I was there.

440
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,250
It was very strange.
It you,

441
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,143
you had this weird feeling of them 
having much more sensitivity than you 

442
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:53,360
imagined that they are aware of you.
But as you said,

443
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:55,700
they're benign and they just sort of 
sitting there.

444
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:56,534
But it was almost like they were saying 
hello to me or that they recognize that 

445
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:02,300
I could tune into them because I was so 
barbecue that I was,

446
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,163
I was on their wavelength.
When you're out there with those plants 

447
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,760
and you said that you felt consciousness
from them now as an intelligent,

448
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:11,594
rational person,
did you start pondering whether or not 

449
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:15,134
you,
we're just perceiving this because it 

450
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:17,444
was convenient and you were 
hallucinating and adding all this 

451
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,560
contextual weirdness to this situation?

452
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,141
I,
you know,

453
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,210
I'm sure I was projecting things.
I went to them,

454
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,210
but,
but I've looked at this question and the

455
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,820
science of it pretty closely.
Right?

456
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,090
And how you define consciousness matters
here,

457
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:40,440
but plants are conscious in the sense of
they're aware of their environment.

458
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:42,780
They have senses.
They're not like our senses,

459
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,853
right?
They're picking up on chemicals in the 

460
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:49,090
air and in the soil and light in very 
specific ways.

461
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:52,030
And they're reacting not just 
instinctually,

462
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,953
but appropriately.
There are experiments that show the 

463
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,534
plants can learn in some primitive way.
So we have to understand that we have 

464
00:20:58,931 --> 00:20:59,764
one kind of consciousness and other 
animals and even plants have another 

465
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,500
kind of consciousness.
So it's real.

466
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:06,334
It's a real thing.
The idea that they're looking back at 

467
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:10,330
me,
I'm being metaphorical,

468
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,230
but I that they're aware of me,
um,

469
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,850
in the way that the,
um,

470
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,403
plan is aware of that the bee is nearby 
and does certain things sometimes to 

471
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:25,510
trap the be and hold it there for a 
longer amount of time to load it up with

472
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:26,020
pollen.

473
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,020
Um,
there are the world as we perceive it is

474
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:34,540
dependent on the particular senses we 
have.

475
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,510
We've got the big five senses that you 
always hear about and there's some other

476
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:38,740
littler ones.
Um,

477
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,720
you know,
how we locate ourselves in space.

478
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:43,030
We're pretty good at that too.
Um,

479
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,750
but other creatures have a different set
of senses and,

480
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,580
and therefore they live in a different 
world.

481
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,240
So the beef for example,
can see ultraviolet light.

482
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:56,350
We can't see.
So if you could get inside of bees head,

483
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,663
the world would look very different.
And you'd see patterns like landing 

484
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,610
markings on flowers in ultraviolet 
colors that they can see that you,

485
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:07,620
you've never seen before.
Ditto.

486
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,960
They also can experience electromagnetic
radiation.

487
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:11,830
We can't,
you know,

488
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,330
it's all around us.
We don't feel it.

489
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,313
They feel it.
And the reason they do is a plant that 

490
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,483
has a strong electromagnetic field 
hasn't been visited recently by another 

491
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:22,370
b.

492
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,203
So they know this is a good,
you're going to get a lot of nectar 

493
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:25,990
here.
And,

494
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,100
um,
whereas if you,

495
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,510
if you're going by,
you know,

496
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:31,270
you're flying by a flower and it's got a
soft field,

497
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,104
doesn't have a big field,
it's probably just been visited by 

498
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:34,750
someone else.
So skip it.

499
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,063
So they're living in a world where 
they're perceiving cell phone radiation 

500
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:41,710
and all,
all the kinds of crap we're putting into

501
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:43,870
the electromagnetic spectrum.
Um,

502
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,153
so,
so we have to realize that this is a 

503
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:51,850
very specific world that we're 
perceiving in our normal consciousness.

504
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:54,640
That is the one that we need to 
perceive.

505
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,503
It's good for us.
[inaudible] we were designed for 

506
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,530
reflecting our bodies and our upright 
stance,

507
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:00,364
everything about us.
But other creatures are seeing a 

508
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:03,154
different world.
And one of the interesting things about 

509
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:08,110
psychedelics is you get some insight 
into that.

510
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,530
You,
you sort of feel it and uh,

511
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,060
it's,
it's real.

512
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:13,894
I think in the sense of sure.
You were imagining there's still a leap 

513
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:20,230
of imagination to understand the world 
or octopus world.

514
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,064
That's a really weird,
where their brains are distributed over 

515
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:25,270
eight arms.
Right.

516
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,530
And seeing that recent paper that was 
just put out,

517
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:33,340
see if you could find it,
they're hypothesizing that octopus,

518
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,920
they might've come here from another 
planet,

519
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,420
literally not,
might've been seeded by another planets.

520
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,810
Very controversial,
but it's from legit scientist.

521
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:45,440
And what they're trying to think of is 
if it's possible that the eggs of things

522
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:46,100
traveled and

523
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,850
comments and somehow that came here 
hundreds of millions of years ago.

524
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,803
And the reason being is that they can 
alter their rna and that this is very 

525
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:59,180
specific to a Octopi are octopuses.
Yeah,

526
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:01,540
here it is.
Octopus's came to earth from space,

527
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,413
frozen eggs billions of years ago.
I don't know if they would put it that 

528
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,594
way,
but it's,

529
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,503
it's just a theory,
but it's a theory that's being bandied 

530
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:11,530
about by legitimate scientists.
It's crazy.

531
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,030
You can do so many things that no other 
animal can do.

532
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:16,370
Like instantaneously changed their 
outside.

533
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,980
Yes.
To blend into their area.

534
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:19,814
Also each arm we can make its own 
decisions without referring to 

535
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,480
headquarters.
Really?

536
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:25,550
Yeah.
They have this distributed intelligence.

537
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,400
Wow.
And regenerate as well.

538
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,570
Yes.
Now they are.

539
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:31,460
They're really,
they're really crazy.

540
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,413
Um,
so this idea that there's something 

541
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:35,054
relative about our everyday normal 
consciousness that there are other ways 

542
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:39,464
to experience the world is something 
that psychedelics puts you in touch 

543
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:43,520
with.

544
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,330
It was just reading this interview with 
this physicist named Carlo Ravelli.

545
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:50,660
He's a theoretical physicist from Italy.
He wrote this book a couple of years ago

546
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,510
called seven brief lessons on physics,
very prominent guy.

547
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,943
And he was telling this interview or in 
the Guardian that he got turned on to 

548
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:00,104
physics,
uh,

549
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,300
during an lsd trip he had when he was 
15.

550
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,780
And the interviewer asked him why was 
that?

551
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:06,614
And he said,
well,

552
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,420
I saw for the first time that there 
could be another way to think about time

553
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,820
in instead of,
uh,

554
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,671
you know,
past,

555
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:16,550
present and future that it might all be 
simultaneous.

556
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:19,370
And that's how it appeared to him during
this lsd trip.

557
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,960
And he's,
when he,

558
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,840
when he was back to baseline,
he said,

559
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,800
um,
I,

560
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,210
you know,
I was asking myself,

561
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:27,044
why am I so sure this is the real world?
And that wasn't the real world and it 

562
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:33,800
was just an hallucination.

563
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,933
And he said,
the world as it presents itself to us 

564
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,550
right now here actually physics tells us
is not the real world that there are,

565
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:45,140
you know,
that space and time are curved.

566
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,100
That particles don't exist until they're
perceived by a consciousness.

567
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:49,934
You know,
all these crazy ideas of theoretical 

568
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,460
physics.
He said,

569
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,323
I,
it suddenly seemed like worth exploring 

570
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,693
that,
that the world as it presents itself to 

571
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:00,890
us is not the only world and,
or necessarily the accurate world.

572
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,083
And I was very interested that a 
scientist could develop that idea of a 

573
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:06,674
beyond in the way you would think of a 
religious person developing the idea of 

574
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:11,434
a beyond that there's a scientific 
beyond and there's a religious beyond 

575
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,710
and psychedelics at least gives us a 
hint that,

576
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,290
that those worlds exist.
And that was,

577
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,240
um,
that was very powerful,

578
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,163
powerful idea for me.
Have you looked into any of the 

579
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,440
connections between ancient religions 
and psychedelics?

580
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:30,920
Like,
uh,

581
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,470
any of the John Marco Allegro stuff?
Yeah,

582
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:35,420
I did.
I didn't go that deep into it.

583
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:39,230
I went in deep enough to know that there
are a lot of very serious scholars.

584
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,550
Um,
and,

585
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,710
and he,
allegro is one and Carl ruck another.

586
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,780
Um,
and Gordon Wasson,

587
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:46,614
the guy who kind of brought silicide 
been to the west who I write about at 

588
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:49,704
some length in the book,
really believe that it was a experience 

589
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:54,594
of psychedelics,
which has been in culture for thousands 

590
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,403
of years.
Um,

591
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,560
we know,
um,

592
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,240
whether you're talking about the Amazon 
or Africa or,

593
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,120
and that these experiences may have 
nurtured the religious impulse,

594
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,950
you know,
where do you get the idea of,

595
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,450
of,
of,

596
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,460
beyond where do you get the idea of a 
heaven or a hell,

597
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,250
if not from some altered state of 
consciousness?

598
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,323
You know,
people talked about visiting the 

599
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:21,870
underworld in homer's time.
Um,

600
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,170
so how did they do that?
Was it dreams?

601
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,153
Uh,
dreams don't have the authority that 

602
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:29,670
psychedelic experience has?
Um,

603
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,920
there's something about psychedelic 
experience that,

604
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,990
that,
uh,

605
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,450
has this,
it's not just an opinion,

606
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:37,740
it's just not,
it's not a fantasy.

607
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:38,640
It's something real.

608
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,473
It's objective truth.
This is William James called the noetic 

609
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:45,390
quality of the mystical experience.
Um,

610
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,150
and that's certitude,
um,

611
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,043
comes from psychedelics.
And so it seems totally plausible to me 

612
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:55,850
that at the very earliest stages of,
uh,

613
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,023
humanity,
if people were indeed taking 

614
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:01,770
psychedelics,
this might explain how they came up with

615
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:03,510
these ideas.
Um,

616
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,110
there are other alternative theories and
it's not provable.

617
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,480
I just don't know how we would begin to 
prove it,

618
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,250
but it seems plausible.
Um,

619
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,563
and you know,
the ancient Greeks had a psychedelic 

620
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,890
that they used,
we think called the,

621
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,730
they called it the Kiki on k,
y,

622
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:18,271
k,
e,

623
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:19,104
O,
n.

624
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,213
And they had an annual,
a ritual ceremony and it was the only 

625
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,410
time in the year where you could use 
this drug.

626
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:30,770
And it was a ritual to for diameter and 
harvest or planting time.

627
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,190
And everybody in Greek society did this 
and people,

628
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:35,911
it was,
you had,

629
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,650
it was secret,
it was called the mysteries,

630
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:41,190
the Eleusinian mysteries and you weren't
supposed to talk about it,

631
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,024
but there's a few accounts around and 
people talked about visiting the 

632
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:48,120
underworld,
making contact with the dead and um,

633
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,910
call ruck who's a classicist to be use 
as well.

634
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,743
That was a,
that was a psychedelic potion and we 

635
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:54,054
don't know what they were using,
whether it was mushrooms or something 

636
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:56,820
else.
Um,

637
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,850
the Greek use of drugs is very obscure.
They only talked about wine,

638
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,430
but the way they describe what wine did 
to you,

639
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,473
there was clearly something added to it 
that they were adding other plant drugs 

640
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:12,420
to their wine because they would have 
these tiny little glasses.

641
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:14,850
And they'd take these big trips so we 
don't know what it was.

642
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,400
Yeah.
Tiny glasses of one tiny glasses.

643
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:19,860
And they were very careful about when 
you used it and,

644
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:22,950
and you know,
people would completely lose control and

645
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:24,090
it was just like,
no,

646
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:25,860
this isn't wine.
This is something else.

647
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,843
Yeah.
It is some sort of a psychic delicate 

648
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:30,660
from grapes or know it too.
Well,

649
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,150
I mean,
we don't know some people,

650
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,450
Albert Hofmann who discovered lsd or 
invented Lsd,

651
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:38,100
he thought it was air,
got that.

652
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:40,290
They'd figured out a way.
Air God is a,

653
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,220
is a fungus grows on grain.

654
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,250
And it was uh,
the,

655
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:50,251
the precursor chemical to lsd comes from
Aragon and uh,

656
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,143
air.
God is responsible for episodes of mass 

657
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:56,500
delirium and European history.
You get a really wet year.

658
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:57,334
The air got grows on the Rye.
People eat bread made from it and they 

659
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,500
go crazy.
Some people think the Salem witch trials

660
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,620
was came after a wet year and people had
absorbed,

661
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,020
these women had eaten air,
gotten,

662
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,820
we're having visions and things like 
that,

663
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:10,654
which was interpreted as witchcraft,
which to them was a very thought there 

664
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:17,020
were saying that the men had absorbed 
that and thought they were under spells.

665
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,193
Maybe,
maybe,

666
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,420
maybe that too.
I just trip everybody's,

667
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,360
yeah.
So,

668
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,770
um,
anyway,

669
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,530
so,
so they just eat air.

670
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:27,610
God,
you're not going to be,

671
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:29,330
you could get gang green.
It's a myth.

672
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,330
It's not a clean chemical.
And,

673
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,600
um,
but the thinking of,

674
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,463
uh,
Gordon Wasson and call rock and they 

675
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:39,240
were collaborators on this theory,
um,

676
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:44,910
was that the Greeks perhaps had figured 
out a way to derive a pure chemical from

677
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,240
Aragon that could be made into something
very much like lsd.

678
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,283
But again,
nobody has succeeded and they've tried 

679
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:56,080
for the last 20 or 30 years to take air,
got and make something,

680
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,270
you know,
through simple processes that the Greeks

681
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:00,700
could have mastered.
So it may have been a mushroom.

682
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,110
Um,
you know,

683
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,850
there's a lot of psychedelic plants out 
there.

684
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:06,010
It's one of the mysteries of evolution 
that,

685
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,863
you know,
dmt is like coursing through the plant 

686
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,660
world,
thousands of plants.

687
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,290
So,
so I,

688
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,750
I do find it plausible that there is 
some links between psychedelics.

689
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:17,584
I think psychedelics have have 
influenced cultural history at various 

690
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:23,134
points along the way.
And one of those may have been to kind 

691
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:28,660
of nurture this religious impulse,
but again,

692
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,910
it can't prove it.
The Greeks spent,

693
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,833
uh,
some of the great Greek scholar spent a 

694
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:36,190
lot of time in Egypt as well.
Don't know anything about that really.

695
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,900
I was wanting to try and figure it.

696
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,733
Yeah.
That was,

697
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,550
they were trying to figure out what 
psychedelics,

698
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:43,630
if any,
the uh,

699
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:46,030
the Egyptians took and they'd never 
really figured it out.

700
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:46,864
They made some connections to dmt that 
is sort of loosely connected to their 

701
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:51,950
worship of the pineal gland.
Yeah.

702
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,900
Right.
Where we've found DMT and rats.

703
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,991
Yeah.
The,

704
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:57,510
yeah,
the Cottonwood Research Foundation.

705
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,650
Yeah.
So you did that film about DMT,

706
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:00,351
right?
Yeah.

707
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,184
That's really interesting stuff that 
there's been very little follow up on 

708
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:05,164
that.
I mean this idea that there might be an 

709
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:09,910
endogenous psychedelic like dmt I,
as far as I know,

710
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:13,660
we've only found it in the rat.
It's hard to look for it and the amounts

711
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:14,740
are really tiny.
Well,

712
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:15,574
they found dmt in people,
but they haven't found it in the pineal 

713
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:18,334
gland.
If they haven't,

714
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,020
oh,
is that right?

715
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,853
Founded on the liver and the lungs and 
that it's being produced that they know 

716
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:23,614
that humans produce it and it's 
indogenous but they don't know whether 

717
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,040
or not the pineal gland does.

718
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,083
I said the pineal gland represents the 
third eye of eastern mysticism and that 

719
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:32,914
was what also they think what does it is
the eye of horus that they connected to 

720
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,204
the pineal gland.
If you ever seen those comparisons pull 

721
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,280
the comparison between the eye of horus 
and the pineal gland.

722
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,143
It's essentially shaped like a cross 
section of the pineal gland and I'm in 

723
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:50,894
the temple and man,
see if you look at it up there and they 

724
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:56,480
think somehow or another that this is 
the,

725
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:59,570
the connection between these two.
There's a bunch of different things have

726
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:02,180
been written on this,
this connection,

727
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,340
because this appears in so many 
different,

728
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,233
uh,
Egyptian hieroglyphs and they think it 

729
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:10,870
might have some sort of a connection 
between the portal to the afterlife that

730
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:14,080
they think the dmt experiences and the 
idea of the Dao.

731
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,700
How would they,
how would they know?

732
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,040
I mean,
they didn't do they know about brains?

733
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,933
I mean,
they,

734
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,803
well,
I don't know how they know how to build 

735
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:23,660
pyramids.
How'd they know a lot of things.

736
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,580
I mean,
they did some pretty incredible shit.

737
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,750
Yeah.
We don't know,

738
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:28,370
you know,
because of the burning of the library of

739
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:30,680
Alexandria,
we lost almost everything.

740
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,440
We don't really know what they knew or 
how they knew it,

741
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:34,274
but we do know that no,
that scholars from around the world 

742
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:40,430
would go to Egypt to learn.
Well in general,

743
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,293
you know,
I have a more open mind about many 

744
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:45,200
things since I've had these experiences 
now than I did before.

745
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:48,380
I was a kind of staunch materialists.
It's normal.

746
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,483
I mean,
most people see silliness and hippies 

747
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,394
and you know,
all these people that are out there 

748
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:56,870
doing drugs,
trying to air quote find themselves,

749
00:33:56,871 --> 00:34:00,590
you just see two seems like a foolish 
venture and then you do it and you go,

750
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,910
oh okay.

751
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,933
There it's just being done by morons are
being described by morons cause it's 

752
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,090
hard to describe.
It's also illegal.

753
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:11,983
So people shy away from it.
You don't want to lose your family and 

754
00:34:13,671 --> 00:34:14,504
get locked up in jail and all these 
different things that people are 

755
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:17,240
terrified of.
So you'd like,

756
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:18,051
look,
I'm not going to,

757
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:19,580
I'll have a glass of whiskey with 
dinner.

758
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,140
And that's about it.
And also,

759
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:22,910
you know,
there's a kind of embarrassment.

760
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,280
I mean one of the really striking things
that I've,

761
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,520
I've been on the road now for,
this is my second week out talking about

762
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:29,354
this book and I have been struck by how 
many people have had powerful 

763
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:35,480
psychedelic experiences.
They don't talk to anybody about.

764
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,140
And I come along as a kind of,
I dunno,

765
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,780
credible person,
uh,

766
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,960
who's interested.
And they,

767
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,320
this is journalists too.
They turn off the tape recorder and they

768
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:46,670
say,
can I tell you a story?

769
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,893
And they had something happened to them,
might've been in their 20s or 30s or 

770
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,240
earlier that changed the course of their
life.

771
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,133
And either because there was a stigma 
attached to it or it was kind of had 

772
00:34:58,701 --> 00:35:02,570
this sixties kind woo think about it.
Or there were kids around,

773
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,003
they didn't feel comfortable and they,
so they kept it in this box labeled 

774
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:10,310
weird drug experience,
but it's not just a drug experience.

775
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:11,930
So this is your mind.
You know,

776
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:12,764
the drug may have started the process,
but everything you see and in this 

777
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:20,960
experience is the,
those are real psychological facts there

778
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:24,080
from your unconscious or from your 
interpretation or your environment.

779
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,970
Um,
and you know,

780
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,480
it's not the molecule that,
that,

781
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,220
that ordered that for in this 
experience.

782
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,470
Um,
as Stan Stanislav Grof,

783
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:36,950
who was one of the pioneering 
psychedelic psychiatrist in the 60s said

784
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:37,921
that,
uh,

785
00:35:37,921 --> 00:35:38,340
lsd

786
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,580
is an unspecific amplifier of mental 
activity.

787
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,640
There's nothing packaged with the drug.
Um,

788
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,503
and that's important to understand.
So you had this big experience and you 

789
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:51,210
put it in this box thing.
We're drug experience,

790
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,150
but when you take it out,
sometimes you find that there's,

791
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,280
there's a real gold there.
There's fool's gold too.

792
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,670
There's,
it's an interesting quote that quote you

793
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:03,230
just said cause because in actual 
studies of the human mind,

794
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,123
under the influence of Psilocybin,
it's actually been shown to shut off 

795
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:08,170
parts of the brain.
And so the,

796
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,004
the question is,
are we blocking off these constant 

797
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,290
frequencies that are around us?
So this experience that's around us,

798
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,253
it is our own ego or our own mortality 
or own desire to stay alive and protect 

799
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:28,220
ourselves or whatever.
The various blockades that we put up are

800
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:29,054
those diminished by sales side and that 
allows this ever present experience to 

801
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:34,514
manifest itself.

802
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,340
It's exactly right.
The most,

803
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,290
the most interesting scientific finding 
a of this current generation of research

804
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,680
is that when they image the brains of 
people on psilocybin or LSD or Iowasca,

805
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,780
they expected to see fireworks,
right?

806
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,510
Lots of activity because the experience 
has lots of fireworks,

807
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,090
but they found something that they 
didn't expect,

808
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:55,924
which was a diminishment of activity in 
a very important brain network called 

809
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:00,214
the default mode network.
This is in the midline and it connects 

810
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:04,384
parts of your cortex,
which is the evolutionarily most recent 

811
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:07,870
part,
two older,

812
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:10,600
deeper sources of uh,
emotion and memory.

813
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,230
And it's a hub in the brain and the 
brain is a hierarchical system.

814
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,040
And this,
this,

815
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,960
this is the orchestra conductor.
It's one of the neuroscientists put it,

816
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,340
it,
it,

817
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,173
it's a regulator.
So what happens in the default mode 

818
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:22,660
network normally?
Well,

819
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:26,170
it's very involved in um,
self reflection,

820
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,150
self criticism,
worry.

821
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:32,050
It's where your mind goes to wander.
It's involved in time travel,

822
00:37:32,051 --> 00:37:32,884
thinking about the future or the past.
It's involved in something scientists 

823
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:36,754
called theory of mind,
the ability to imagine that another 

824
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,760
person has mental states and it's not 
just Iraq.

825
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,113
Um,
it is involved in what's called the 

826
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:50,071
experiential or autobiographical self.
The way we kind of take what's happening

827
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:54,100
to us and connect it to the story we 
tell ourselves about who we are based on

828
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:55,180
the past.
And the future.

829
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,860
So it's,
you know,

830
00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:59,950
if the ego has an address,
it's in the default mode network.

831
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,360
And what is the ego do for you?
The ego kind of patrols the borders,

832
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,440
right?
It's the,

833
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,560
it's what keeps out,
um,

834
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,390
you know,
things that are threatening to you.

835
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,000
It keeps,
uh,

836
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:17,050
it's responsible for the repression of 
subconscious thought or strong emotion.

837
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,580
Um,
and it,

838
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,601
it,
uh,

839
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:20,470
it's a defense.

840
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:24,190
It's a set of defenses and psychedelics 
appear to turn this off,

841
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,960
uh,
to one degree or another.

842
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,010
Take the default mode network offline.
When that happens,

843
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,440
to go back to your metaphor,
um,

844
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,160
the whatever is blocking the that's 
blocking lots of information from coming

845
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:39,064
in,
from outside or up from below in your 

846
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:46,141
subconscious that's allowed to flow.
And so you are getting more information,

847
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,300
um,
than you might otherwise.

848
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,610
And this is a metaphor that,
um,

849
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,960
aldous Huxley used indoors or perception
that consciousness is a,

850
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:59,770
is eliminating more than it's creating 
its it consciousness is,

851
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,933
is reducing our experience to that thin 
trickle of information we need to get 

852
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,840
ahead to survive.
Um,

853
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,543
and that you,
you opened the doors or perception on 

854
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:17,290
these drugs by turning off this network 
and lots more information comes in which

855
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,060
can be overwhelming,
uh,

856
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,270
but also extraordinary.
I mean there's,

857
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,390
that's wonder

858
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,610
is there apprehension in writing a book 
like this and describing these things,

859
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:27,444
like as you're writing it and you're 
thinking about all these other people 

860
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:30,954
that are sort of cynical straitlaced non
drug using folks who might admire your 

861
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:40,010
previous work on agriculture 
architecture or whatever and,

862
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,390
and you're sitting there going,
how do I,

863
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,653
how do I get this through without 
looking like a guy who's losing his 

864
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:49,300
fucking mind or it's going Super Woo 
Depok trope Ron,

865
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,370
right?
Like,

866
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,343
how do you,
how do you do this and maintain your 

867
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:56,640
position as a serious journalist?
Well,

868
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,700
I was nervous about undertaking this 
project.

869
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,563
Um,
but I also came to think it was really 

870
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:06,330
important and um,
that there was something here and that,

871
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,730
you know,
when I started this process,

872
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:11,130
Stan Grof,
the guy or I made reference to earlier,

873
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,860
he had said in the 60 something I 
thought was really outrageous.

874
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:16,920
He said that the psychedelics would be 
for the study of the mind,

875
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,390
what the microscope was for biology or 
the telescope for us.

876
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,470
Uh,
astronomy.

877
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,290
This is a really outrageous claim to 
make.

878
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,540
Um,
but as time's gone on,

879
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:28,374
that idea seems less crazy to me that we
are learning things about the mind that 

880
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:34,314
the,
and that these drugs are teaching it in 

881
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:39,660
a scientific context and in an 
individual context.

882
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,123
Um,
so just because some people think it's 

883
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,410
embarrassing or Wu is not a way,
is not a reason not to do it.

884
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,710
I have to find a way to describe it.
And you know,

885
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:50,544
I'm being a little speculative with you 
talking about origins of religion and 

886
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:54,204
stuff,
but the book stays pretty close to 

887
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,920
here's what we really know and here's 
what I experienced.

888
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,590
Um,
I'm a science journalist,

889
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,830
you know,
and um,

890
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,890
uh,
so I try to draw the line between,

891
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:07,680
now I'm speculating and now here's 
something that we really know with some,

892
00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:10,620
with some certitude,
but without question,

893
00:41:10,621 --> 00:41:14,340
I had some misgivings about describing 
psychedelic experience,

894
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,100
their legal issues there.
Um,

895
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,540
and that,
yeah,

896
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:21,200
I have a readership.
I have a big readership that you know,

897
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,460
is happy if I just keep writing books on
food.

898
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,323
But I had found something to,
to interesting to pass up and I've been 

899
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:30,410
gratified that,
um,

900
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,603
you know,
I've been talking about this book on 

901
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,823
like network television.
I didn't think I would be talking to 

902
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:40,070
Steven Colbert about ego dissolution and
here we are.

903
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,390
And he actually got the best line off on
that whole appearance.

904
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,443
He said,
um,

905
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,220
uh,
he said,

906
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,054
well,
maybe the ego should be a controlled 

907
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:51,230
substance.
I thought that was pretty good.

908
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,780
It is a great line is fast.
He's a clever boy.

909
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,220
Oh yeah.
So,

910
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,050
um,
so I found though that the,

911
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,530
if I was willing to talk about these 
issues in my experiences,

912
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:05,060
in a matter of fact way mainstream 
journalists would respond in kind.

913
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,760
And so I've been on the CBS morning show
and,

914
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,000
uh,
Terry Gross on fresh air and,

915
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,140
and we've had a kind of,
you know,

916
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,750
conversation where we're looking at 
these as tools.

917
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,823
What are they good for?
What are they not good for without 

918
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:19,670
getting caught up in the usual,
um,

919
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,320
uh,
craziness that's associated with these,

920
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,640
with these drugs.
And,

921
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,533
um,
so that's what I'm trying to do is take 

922
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:31,430
that sixties crust off these things and 
take a fresh look.

923
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,530
Well,

924
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,160
for someone like me who's been a 
psychedelic advocate for a long time,

925
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:41,190
it was extremely exciting news that a 
guy like you were stepping into the fray

926
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:43,803
because you're,
you're so well established and well 

927
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:46,474
respected already that I knew your 
approach on it was going to be very 

928
00:42:49,961 --> 00:42:50,794
clean and that I knew that people were 
going to have to start looking at this 

929
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:53,701
like,
wait,

930
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:55,630
it's Michael Pollan's looking at this 
like this,

931
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,723
this might not be completely crazy,
but the cultural attitudes about 

932
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:04,150
psychedelic drugs or drugs in general 
were so childlike and our,

933
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,710
our view on drugs,
I mean,

934
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,500
I have a friend,
wonderful person,

935
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,633
talks all kinds of crazy shit about 
people smoking pot and take xanax every 

936
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,830
day.
It's like,

937
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,580
do people,
don't all,

938
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:17,590
I just need a glass of wine and Xanax 
and I'm good.

939
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:19,210
I don't know why you people need drugs.
Like,

940
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,270
wow.
Like you're fucking crazy.

941
00:43:22,271 --> 00:43:23,104
But our cultural attitudes on the 
substances that are prohibited and that 

942
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,630
are,
that are accepted,

943
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,480
there's so strange and they,
they,

944
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,890
because of our social standing,
because we don't want to be perceived as

945
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:40,270
foolish or reckless or in some sort of a
mid life crisis or what have you.

946
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:41,104
We were like these journalists that are 
shutting the microphones off and wanted 

947
00:43:43,271 --> 00:43:44,104
to talk to you about these profound 
experiences that they had that they 

948
00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:47,860
should be shouting about from the roof 
rooftops.

949
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,581
I agree.
Look,

950
00:43:48,581 --> 00:43:51,340
it's really to normalize this,
people have to come out of the closet.

951
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,300
Yeah.
And some do.

952
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:53,134
I,
I was talking to a journalist in Boston 

953
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:55,234
who was the local NPR host and he,
he on the air live talked about his 

954
00:43:58,421 --> 00:43:59,254
experiences and how important they were 
in shaping his identity and the 

955
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:03,973
experiences he had in college.
So I think we're going to see more 

956
00:44:06,191 --> 00:44:09,880
people come out of the closet and uh,
and have this kind of conversation will,

957
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,520
and we can actually look at this 
experience in the same way now.

958
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:13,960
Yes,
it's still illegal.

959
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,620
But the fact that there is all this 
legal research going on,

960
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,590
it has created a space where you can 
talk about it.

961
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:21,424
And I,
I'm interviewing all these people and 

962
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,430
they're describing their trips and 
they're,

963
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,830
you know,
they're very straight people and um,

964
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,990
and they've had profound experiences.

965
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,950
So I think the culture is changing.
I really do.

966
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,310
I definitely think it is with which,
well,

967
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:36,144
I hope so.
I didn't write it with that idea that I 

968
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,274
had this authority that I earned and 
talking about food and nutrition and 

969
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:44,340
then I'm going to apply it now to drugs.
I don't think that way.

970
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:46,500
I was just like,
I'm starting from scratch.

971
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,753
But I do realize that,
and people scare me a little when they 

972
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:50,700
say,
you know,

973
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,530
peep psychedelic.
People say,

974
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,880
you know,
you're going to do for,

975
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,230
for silicide been what you did for food.
So that's really different.

976
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,520
Um,
you know,

977
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,780
I mean,
or this woman,

978
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,390
I was speaking at Google in Seattle and 
this,

979
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,820
this woman stands up and she says,
well,

980
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,500
after I read your book,
I had a,

981
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,880
I had a slaughter,
a pig.

982
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,530
I had to learn how to slaughter a pig.

983
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,350
You made me want to do that.
And when I was driving to work today,

984
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:16,290
I didn't think I'd,
I'd ever take Lsd,

985
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,750
but now or silicide but,
but now I feel like I need to,

986
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,183
I don't want to do that to people.
I don't want them to feel they have to 

987
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:26,580
have this experience.
You can learn a lot about the mind.

988
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,670
This book is as much about the mind as 
it is about psychedelics.

989
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,190
Right.
This is a book that uses psychedelics to

990
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:35,040
explore this really interesting mystery 
call consciousness.

991
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,293
Um,
and it's also exploring the nature of 

992
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,200
addiction,
the nature of depression,

993
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,034
all the,
all the illnesses that psychedelics 

994
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,470
turns out to be very helpful in.
Um,

995
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:47,671
you know,
but I,

996
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:50,370
I'm not holding a brief that people 
should do this.

997
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,640
Um,
I'm not an addict.

998
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,680
I'm not an advocate for psychedelics.
I'm an advocate for the research at this

999
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:56,010
point.

1000
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,750
I don't know enough to say,
yeah,

1001
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,880
everybody should do this.
This is what our culture needs.

1002
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:00,421
You know,
I don't,

1003
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:02,890
I'm not in that Timothy leary had,
you know,

1004
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,450
I think,
I think we have a powerful agent that,

1005
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,313
that there is good data now that this 
can help heal people who are really 

1006
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:11,664
suffering.
And the other reason for the openness 

1007
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,753
that's going on right now,
that surprised me because I expected to 

1008
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:20,670
get a lot of pushback from the 
psychiatric establishment.

1009
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,631
Uh,
and I,

1010
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:23,760
and I looked for it.
I called around,

1011
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,470
you know,
I want to hear the critical voice on the

1012
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:29,160
hopkins work and the Nyu work.
And when I kept hearing,

1013
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,450
blew my mind,
it was like,

1014
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,313
I remember calling the head of the 
National Institute of Mental Health to 

1015
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:34,194
get what I thought would be a really 
negative quote about silicide been 

1016
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:37,830
research and he was like,
no.

1017
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,950
Then we have to look at this.
This is really interesting research,

1018
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:42,623
former heads of the American psychiatric
association and the reason they're so 

1019
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:46,884
open to it is that mental health 
treatment in this country is just a 

1020
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:51,384
mess.
I mean we only reach half of the people 

1021
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,240
who are struggling with mental illness 
at all,

1022
00:46:57,241 --> 00:46:58,074
have any exposure to the system.
If you compare mental health treatment 

1023
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:03,960
to any other branch of medicine,
oncology,

1024
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:04,794
cardiology,
infectious disease is accomplished very 

1025
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:09,150
little.
It hasn't prolonged lifespan,

1026
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,430
it's not saving lives.
Um,

1027
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,360
and yet we have,
uh,

1028
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,340
you know,
soaring rates of depression.

1029
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,870
Depression is now the leading cause of 
disability worldwide.

1030
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,033
There 300 million people with major 
depression or treatment resistant 

1031
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:24,930
depression in the world right now.
Um,

1032
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,840
and suicide rates are way up.
Um,

1033
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,470
partly it's the vets,
but,

1034
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,610
uh,
in general,

1035
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,623
uh,
the taboo is coming off is come off 

1036
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,680
suicide and suicide is climbing rapidly 
and addiction is,

1037
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:36,610
we know,
is rampant,

1038
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,470
so they need some new tools.

1039
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,303
There hasn't really been innovation in 
mental health treatment since the early 

1040
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:43,901
nineties,
late eighties,

1041
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:46,990
with the introduction of the SSRI 
antidepressants,

1042
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,070
drugs like,
you know,

1043
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:50,230
uh,
paxil and PROZAC.

1044
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,273
Um,
they need some new tools and that's why 

1045
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:54,214
they're open to this.
And that's why I think it will be 

1046
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:58,990
embraced eventually by,
um,

1047
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,460
by the medical world.
Well,

1048
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,790
isn't it on the ballot in 2018 in 
California?

1049
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,653
They haven't quite gotten,
and they're doing their petition drive 

1050
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,310
right now and an Oregon too.
And um,

1051
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,950
so I don't know that it'll get through 
this time.

1052
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:16,510
It's a weird item to put on the ballot 
because actually a small minority people

1053
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:19,000
know what silicide is.
When I on this show,

1054
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:19,834
you're the first person who said the 
ingredient in Ma didn't say the 

1055
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:24,154
ingredient in magic mushrooms.
You have some confidence that your 

1056
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:27,064
audience knows what suicide in his butt,
but it's an unfamiliar world to most 

1057
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:32,140
people.
So I don't know how people vote on that.

1058
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:33,640
Right?
Yeah.

1059
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,350
It may be premature is what I'm 
suggesting.

1060
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,260
Well,
it's all dependent upon getting the word

1061
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:40,690
out.
I think if people understand what,

1062
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:41,524
like the John Hopkins research or just 
the anecdotal research that some of 

1063
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:45,880
these people have,
uh,

1064
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,990
had these incredibly life changing 
experiences.

1065
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:50,824
But I think one of the things that 
you're saying is I think very important 

1066
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,183
is that this isn't for everybody.
And that if you have problems with 

1067
00:48:57,221 --> 00:49:00,010
normal consciousness,
this is likely not for you.

1068
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,580
If you're one of those people that has 
schizophrenia and your family perhaps.

1069
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,613
Got It.
Yeah.

1070
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,180
And in fact those people are screened 
out of this research very carefully.

1071
00:49:08,181 --> 00:49:09,014
Yeah.

1072
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,120
Because the Fredonia,
it's,

1073
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,230
it's a real issue with people with a 
psilocybin and Ma many psychedelics,

1074
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:14,740
right?
Yeah.

1075
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,573
Yeah.
What happens with schizophrenia is if 

1076
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:19,290
you are at risk for it,
um,

1077
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,270
either for a,
because of inheritance,

1078
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,780
um,
a psychedelic trip can set you off,

1079
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:26,614
can be the trigger for a life of it and 
other things can to a divorce your 

1080
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:33,700
parents getting divorced sets people 
off,

1081
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:34,534
go to graduate school sets people.
If you're someone who's probably going 

1082
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:41,020
to get schizophrenia,
any kind of mental trauma,

1083
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,900
if it happens at that window,
which is in your early twenties,

1084
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:45,160
in your late twenties,
I think.

1085
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,840
Um,
and that's,

1086
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:47,913
that's why we did see some cases because
that's the age people were using 

1087
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:54,160
psychedelics in the 60s of having their 
first psychotic break.

1088
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,830
So yeah.
So if you're at risk for that or,

1089
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:58,570
or bipolar as well,
by the way.

1090
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,620
That's right.
Oh yeah.

1091
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,940
Marijuana can do it.
Also,

1092
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,470
I think the,
the,

1093
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,590
the numbers though mirror the numbers,
uh,

1094
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,900
in standard populations when it terms of
like,

1095
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,310
I think it's one out of 10,
like one out of 10 people have some form

1096
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:16,210
of schizophrenia and that's mirrored in 
marijuana use.

1097
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,620
I didn't know that.
That's right.

1098
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:19,960
I think it's the same.
I think the problem is,

1099
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,123
you know,
it can exacerbate it or it can trigger 

1100
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:25,030
it or you know,
depending upon,

1101
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:28,100
I mean,
everyone's biology's different

1102
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,530
and everyone's,
uh,

1103
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,340
the,
the way they absorb these,

1104
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,310
these chemicals is different.
Yeah.

1105
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:35,990
And you know,
if you are at risk,

1106
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,000
something's going to do it eventually.
Um,

1107
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:39,950
so,
you know,

1108
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,993
we,
we don't have any evidence of someone 

1109
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:43,754
thrown into a situation of schizophrenia
or other serious mental illness as a 

1110
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:48,764
result of a,
strictly because of the psychedelic 

1111
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:53,480
experience.
It may have been the trigger,

1112
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,730
but there might have been,
it was going to happen anyway.

1113
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:56,990
Right.
We just don't know.

1114
00:50:56,991 --> 00:50:58,790
But in general,
if you've got serious,

1115
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:01,370
if you have personality disorder,
if you have bipolar,

1116
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:02,204
if you are at risk for schizophrenia,
they will not accept you into these 

1117
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:06,590
trials and you should stay away from 
these drugs.

1118
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,320
Yeah.
Um,

1119
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,530
that,
that,

1120
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,310
that is a real problem with it being 
prohibited.

1121
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,600
The prohibition has really set back 
research and understanding decades.

1122
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:18,434
I mean,
we should have been studying this stuff 

1123
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:19,770
since the sixth.

1124
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,850
We had 30 years of hiatus in the 
research.

1125
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,793
I don't know if another time where you 
had a promising line of scientific 

1126
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:29,690
inquiry all through the 50s and early 
sixties,

1127
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:33,350
that's just choked off.
And for 30 years nothing happened.

1128
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:35,180
I mean,
think of what we would know if we had 30

1129
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:37,310
more years of research with these drugs.
It's crazy.

1130
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,970
So now we're picking up the thread and 
all that research is being resumed.

1131
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,043
But your,
but your point about prohibition is 

1132
00:51:42,951 --> 00:51:44,930
really important.
When you have prohibition,

1133
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:47,630
you can't regulate something.
It's a free for all.

1134
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:52,870
Um,
whereas if you did legalize silicide and

1135
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:55,760
let's take as an example,
you could set rules.

1136
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:56,623
You could say that it can only be 
administered by licensed guides or in a 

1137
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:03,920
medical context or that no one under a 
certain age can have it.

1138
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,950
I mean it gives you a chance to regulate
and that's why it's Saner to,

1139
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,740
to legalize,
not in a free for all kinds of way,

1140
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:13,574
but in a,
in a very considered way then to have 

1141
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,160
the system we have now where people are 
going to take the drug,

1142
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:21,650
whether they should or not without any 
kind of clearance.

1143
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,510
Uh,
and by the way,

1144
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:25,060
who knows what you're getting.
You,

1145
00:52:25,061 --> 00:52:26,730
you know,
you can also regulate the,

1146
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:28,430
the strength and the,
um,

1147
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,620
and in the case of Lsd,
you know,

1148
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:31,454
in the 60s there was this period where 
there was a lot of pure lsd around and 

1149
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:34,724
then the mob got an interest in it and 
they started cutting it with speed and 

1150
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:41,180
all sorts of things and people got into 
it a lot of trouble.

1151
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,190
It's also the issue with scheduling,
like scheduled ones for things that have

1152
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:49,760
zero medical value and that's where a 
lot of these drugs find themselves.

1153
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,900
Academics are all schedule,
which is just bananas,

1154
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,180
especially Dmt w the old Terence Mckenna
line.

1155
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,530
Uh,
everyone's holding.

1156
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,503
Yes.
We all,

1157
00:52:58,850 --> 00:52:59,683
we all have dmt in our bodies.
We all have a schedule one substance 

1158
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:02,954
flowing through our veins,
which is the most asinine thing in the 

1159
00:53:06,531 --> 00:53:09,230
world to make your body a schedule one 
substance.

1160
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,371
Yeah,
it is.

1161
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:11,204
And the fact is that schedule one means 
that these drugs have a high potential 

1162
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:14,744
for abuse,
which isn't really true with 

1163
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:17,444
psychedelics cause they're not addictive
and that they have no accepted medical 

1164
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,330
use,
which is now no longer true either.

1165
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:26,100
Because these studies have shown that 
they do have a medical

1166
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,910
use.
Yeah.

1167
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:30,660
So you know,
what I hope happens and what,

1168
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,050
and what we're on track to see happen is
that these,

1169
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,110
these trials,
these drug trials we'll expand.

1170
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:39,120
There will be now phase three drug 
trials,

1171
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:41,580
which is the last step before FDA 
approval.

1172
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,403
If the results of those trials are 
anywhere near as good as the phase two 

1173
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:47,184
trials,
the FDA will then approve psilocybin as 

1174
00:53:50,671 --> 00:53:54,330
a medicine and MTMA which there,
which probably happened first.

1175
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,920
They're looking at that too,
uh,

1176
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:58,950
for use in treating people with trauma.
Uh,

1177
00:53:58,951 --> 00:53:59,784
and then we will be in a world where 
they'll have to reschedule it a to two 

1178
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,560
or three.
Um,

1179
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,000
you know,
the opiates are too,

1180
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,540
I mean,
actually the drug causing most suffering

1181
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:12,360
in our country right now in death is not
a schedule one.

1182
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:14,490
It's a schedule too.
I think it's too,

1183
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:16,020
it might be three.
Um,

1184
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,980
and so that we may see this in the next 
five years or so,

1185
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,570
which is kind of amazing.

1186
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:22,993
Well,
we've got to get someone like jeff 

1187
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:27,350
sessions out of there that requires some
fairly archaic ideas.

1188
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:27,490
Yeah,

1189
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,550
I agree about marijuana.
You know,

1190
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:31,900
I thought that,
okay,

1191
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,660
in this administration we're going to 
have another backlash.

1192
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,560
But one of the things that surprise me 
is that their voices on the right,

1193
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,630
uh,
supporting this research.

1194
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,493
I'm seeing more of it.
Rebecca Mercer has given money to maps 

1195
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,490
the Multidisciplinary Association of 
Psychedelic studies for their work on,

1196
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,870
uh,
Mtma.

1197
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:50,843
Um,
and Steve Bannon has spoken out in 

1198
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:55,240
approval of this research.
So,

1199
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,400
and Peter Teal is,
um,

1200
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,263
you know,
is investing in a psychedelic 

1201
00:54:59,771 --> 00:55:02,320
pharmaceutical company that's getting 
started in England.

1202
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:06,100
So I don't think it,
it may not break down in the usual right

1203
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:08,570
left way that we're so accustomed to,
um,

1204
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,180
and that may give it some protection.

1205
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,273
Well,
I think one of the things that'll help 

1206
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:12,624
is anyone who has a loved one that's 
going through a terminal illness and 

1207
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:21,111
experiences these things and sees the 
profound alleviation of anxiety and this

1208
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,750
just lessening of the worry of passing 
on.

1209
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,160
And Larry Hagman was once on a,
like a real straight television show,

1210
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:31,740
like CBS or Fox News or something like 
that.

1211
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,850
And they asked him about his life and 
like what,

1212
00:55:34,851 --> 00:55:35,684
what makes him so happy?
And he said he had a profound acid trip 

1213
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,140
and you see the host going,
what?

1214
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:41,611
He goes,
yeah,

1215
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:46,140
well I took a,
a really powerful dose of Lsd and a,

1216
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:49,170
it completely alleviated my worries 
about dying.

1217
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:50,903
And you know,
I remember seeing him on television 

1218
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:53,131
going,
wow,

1219
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:53,964
they didn't know this was coming and 
seeing this straight interview or just 

1220
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:00,120
trying to uncomfortably move past the 
subject.

1221
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:00,983
Okay,
well the guy from Dallas is a fucking 

1222
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:05,220
drug addict.
I didn't know what to do with it,

1223
00:56:05,221 --> 00:56:06,054
but he was so warm and smiling and I 
believe it was a piece on his house 

1224
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,203
because he had some crazy off the grid 
sort of life and some ecofriendly house 

1225
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:18,900
and all solar powered and used a well 
and all this different things.

1226
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,370
And uh,
you know,

1227
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:21,204
they were asking him what made him so 
happy and I'll never forget that he was 

1228
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,040
saying

1229
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,720
when he did acid wants a really powerful
experience.

1230
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,380
Cary grant also,
uh,

1231
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,820
had 60,
um,

1232
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,880
guided LSD trips in the late fifties,
and he gave an interview in 1959 to a,

1233
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:38,890
uh,
a Gospel,

1234
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,630
very famous Joseph hyams who was the 
gossip columns.

1235
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,500
So that time saying this had changed his
life.

1236
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,810
He was using a low dose.
They were,

1237
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:51,160
there were a lot of psychiatrists in la 
who were giving a low dose Lsd to people

1238
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,023
in their normal talk therapy sessions to
essentially it was called psycholytic 

1239
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:55,954
therapy cause it was mind loosening 
therapy and it would give you more 

1240
00:56:59,261 --> 00:57:00,094
access to your unconscious and make you 
be able to talk about things that you 

1241
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,890
might otherwise feel very defensive 
about.

1242
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,093
And he had 60 of these sessions and he 
said he was born again and he said that 

1243
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:12,610
it had made him a much better actor 
because he no longer had an ego.

1244
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,800
Uh,
he wasn't crippled by his ego,

1245
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,890
but then he also said,
and it made me irresistible to women.

1246
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,930
Sounds a little egotistical,
have no ego with chicks love.

1247
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,793
Yeah.

1248
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,020
That's hilarious.
Are you aware of any of the research are

1249
00:57:29,021 --> 00:57:32,950
doing now with ketamine and depression 
and they're there?

1250
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:33,933
There's a lot of people that are getting
administered pretty high doses of 

1251
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,420
intravenous and intramuscular ketamine 
for depression,

1252
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:42,940
including one of my good friends,
a Neil Brennan.

1253
00:57:42,941 --> 00:57:43,774
He's gone through it several times and 
talked about it on the podcast and said 

1254
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,584
it was a real game changer.
There's a lot of excitement in 

1255
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:53,440
psychiatry about ketamine,
ketamine as an anesthetic.

1256
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,071
Uh,
it's,

1257
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:55,550
it dissociative,
uh,

1258
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,393
it,
it makes you feel separated from your 

1259
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:59,960
body and that helps with pain.
Um,

1260
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:00,993
so it's,
I don't know if it's strictly speaking 

1261
00:58:01,991 --> 00:58:02,824
the Psychedelic,
it's certainly not a classic 

1262
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:06,070
psychedelic.
It doesn't work on those brain networks.

1263
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,420
Um,
but,

1264
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,790
uh,
it is legal because it's been used as an

1265
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,624
anesthetic for years and it's relatively
safe as an anesthetic compared to some 

1266
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:14,710
of the others that are used.

1267
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,360
It's the one they use.
If,

1268
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,253
if,
um,

1269
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,183
you know,
you come into the trauma center and 

1270
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:19,954
you'd been shot or something,
you need surgery and they don't have 

1271
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,380
time to check whether you're allergic to
any other drugs.

1272
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:24,723
That's the safe one to give you in a 
crisis would carry it around during 

1273
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:27,784
times of war.
And then that's turned to people on the 

1274
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:29,500
field.
Yeah,

1275
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,333
they all,
yeah.

1276
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,690
Um,
and uh,

1277
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,583
this,
they don't really understand how it 

1278
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:35,254
works,
but they give people what is kind of a 

1279
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:39,400
psychedelic dose.
They go way out there.

1280
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,070
It's fairly brief,
I believe,

1281
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,820
and many people with depression have 
found relief.

1282
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,680
It,
it's not permanent.

1283
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,000
Um,
they need to,

1284
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:52,420
it looks like they need to do it again 
every six months or something like that.

1285
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:53,703
Uh,
but it seems to kind of reset the brain 

1286
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,190
in a way that,
um,

1287
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,170
many people are finding helpful.

1288
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,670
And this is all legal.
I mean,

1289
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,440
you can,
there are ketamine clinics,

1290
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,700
uh,
where you can go,

1291
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,650
uh,
and psychiatrists who are,

1292
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,000
who are administering it to people.
Um,

1293
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:13,350
so for people who are struggling with 
depression and can't wait for psilocybin

1294
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:17,380
therapy to be approved for depression,
which is still several years away,

1295
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:19,540
ketamine is,
is worth exploring.

1296
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,550
What about,
did you look into that at all?

1297
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,350
A little bit.
Um,

1298
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,273
I begin is a psychedelic from a root of 
a tree that grows in Africa and it has 

1299
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:32,630
been used specifically to treat opiate 
addiction.

1300
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,520
Um,
and that's God,

1301
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:35,354
if we need something now a tool to deal 
with opiate addiction are clinics in 

1302
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:41,050
Mexico where they one down there.
Yeah.

1303
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:43,760
You opened it after he had his own 
personal problems with pills.

1304
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:46,160
He had a back injury,
got hooked on pills,

1305
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:47,960
was really struggling to get off of 
them.

1306
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,220
Went to Mexico to do Ibogaine caught 
completely off of it felt amazing.

1307
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,270
Realize like,
oh my God,

1308
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:55,730
I have to help people.
And then opened up his own clinic.

1309
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,580
It's amazing.
I mean there's a bunch in Guadalajara,

1310
00:59:58,581 --> 00:59:59,930
I don't know where he is,
but there is,

1311
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:00,890
um,
there is uh,

1312
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,880
you know,
people doing it.

1313
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:04,250
I don't know exactly what the legal 
status is in Mexico,

1314
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:05,084
whether it's legal or just tolerated.
Most drugs have been decriminalized in 

1315
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:11,840
Mexico,
including LSD and mushrooms and a lot of

1316
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:12,674
other things to try to do something to 
curb the violence from the drug cartels 

1317
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,070
at least keep it nonlocal right.
You know,

1318
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,560
a lot of the violence is coming from the
drug cartels,

1319
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:26,561
getting money to ship everything to the 
United States with our use.

1320
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:28,183
It is very strange that our insistence 
on prohibition is actually funding one 

1321
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:32,804
of the largest drug and violence 
epidemics we've ever seen in terms of 

1322
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:38,720
like what's happening south of the 
border.

1323
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:39,211
Well,
yeah,

1324
01:00:39,211 --> 01:00:41,330
and think about Columbia to the civil 
war in Colombia.

1325
01:00:41,331 --> 01:00:44,570
It was funded by our card or cocaine 
interest.

1326
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:48,260
Um,
so I began as a very intense drug.

1327
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,690
It is,
uh,

1328
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,080
did you do it for though?
I didn't,

1329
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:51,973
I didn't.
Uh,

1330
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,813
and I wouldn't do it,
I don't think because it has big 

1331
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:59,150
implications for your heart and yeah,
and in fact when you,

1332
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:00,463
so it is more toxic to the body than the
so called classic psychedelics and it 

1333
01:01:04,311 --> 01:01:07,070
can last like 36 hours.
It's a very long trip.

1334
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:11,270
It's really intense in these clinics.
They s you have to be on a heart monitor

1335
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:12,680
while they're,
while you're doing it.

1336
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,240
Um,
and that was like,

1337
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,860
I had a,
I had a,

1338
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,510
I have a minor heart issue that,
that made me stay away from Mtma,

1339
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,650
which is an amphetamine.
Um,

1340
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,870
and uh,
you know,

1341
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:24,704
I mean I'm the kind of guy who goes to 
his cardiologist before he has six 

1342
01:01:27,261 --> 01:01:29,960
psychedelic trips to check it all out 
and make sure it's okay.

1343
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,530
I have something called Afib,
a atrial fibrillation,

1344
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,550
which,
um,

1345
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,440
you know,
his Ma you can manage with,

1346
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:38,060
uh,
with medicine,

1347
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,043
uh,
or there's a procedure you can get it 

1348
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:42,660
just to kind of occasional irregular.
Yeah,

1349
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,840
it just happens sometimes.
Um,

1350
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,793
but my cardiologist warned me off of MDM
may because it can raise your heart 

1351
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:50,930
rate.
Although I've subsequently learned,

1352
01:01:50,931 --> 01:01:52,950
if you take a Beta blocker,
uh,

1353
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,380
it's okay.
Um,

1354
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:55,820
so anyway,
I have,

1355
01:01:55,821 --> 01:01:58,910
I've never experimented with that.
But anyway,

1356
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:01,520
in light of that,
uh,

1357
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,383
I,
uh,

1358
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,860
I would stay away from,
I began,

1359
01:02:03,861 --> 01:02:04,694
but I'm really curious about it just 
because we have such a crisis with 

1360
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:07,780
addiction.
Uh,

1361
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:08,743
but silicide been is,
is being used successfully for 

1362
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:11,840
addiction.
I talked to,

1363
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,700
uh,
smoking people,

1364
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:14,623
lifelong smokers who broke their 
addiction with a single or two silicide 

1365
01:02:18,011 --> 01:02:20,550
and journeys.
And they had extraordinary

1366
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,160
stories to tell.
Um,

1367
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:23,063
I didn't understand how you could have 
one trip and then give up a lifelong 

1368
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:27,720
habit.
And I asked people about this and,

1369
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,980
uh,
I talked to this one woman,

1370
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:32,130
she was about 60,
and she was an Irish book editor,

1371
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,570
and she,
uh,

1372
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:35,010
she said on her,
I said,

1373
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:36,120
so what happened?
How'd you,

1374
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,440
how'd you stop?
She said,

1375
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:38,274
I,
uh,

1376
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,233
well,
I first I grew wings and I flew through 

1377
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:43,650
European history and I visited,
you know,

1378
01:02:43,651 --> 01:02:44,484
the site of Shakespeare's globe theater.
And I saw the Salem witch trials and I 

1379
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:49,943
died three times and I saw my body a 
rising from a funeral pyre on the 

1380
01:02:53,431 --> 01:02:54,264
Ganges.
And I realize the universe was so 

1381
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:56,874
amazing and there were so many 
incredible things to do that killing 

1382
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:01,560
yourself with cigarettes seem kind of 
stupid.

1383
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:04,980
I was like,
I could've told you that.

1384
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:05,880
Wow.

1385
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,590
But see,
it goes back to that,

1386
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,783
that noetic quality that the,
she had a perspective on her life she'd 

1387
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:12,894
never had or on the universe and that 
she believed that smoking was stupid in 

1388
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:22,560
a way she knew before,
but it didn't have that conviction.

1389
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:26,220
That rock hard review revealed truth,
conviction.

1390
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:27,773
And I heard that for many people and I 
asked the doctor about it or the 

1391
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:32,220
psychologist who was running the study 
says,

1392
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:33,054
yeah,
everybody has these Duh moments and 

1393
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:38,040
they're on their psychedelic trips.
Then ended up being transformative.

1394
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:42,210
Did you have a dumb moment?
I had a lot of insights.

1395
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,070
Um,
I don't know if I,

1396
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:45,240
yeah,
I did actually.

1397
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,790
I have different trips.
Did you have while you're doing,

1398
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,530
I had a six or seven.
I,

1399
01:03:48,531 --> 01:03:51,720
I,
so I just a couple to silicide trips.

1400
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:53,730
One guy did one,
not an LSD trip,

1401
01:03:53,731 --> 01:03:56,850
guided a couple IOWASCA circles.

1402
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,410
And then,
um,

1403
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:02,010
I had a really weird psychedelic call,
five Meo DMT,

1404
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:07,070
which is the smoked venom of the Sonoran
desert toad who figured that out,

1405
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,210
you know,
she gets some kind of prize.

1406
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,460
Um,
but um,

1407
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,880
that's a pretty,
pretty potent,

1408
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:15,780
very potent and thank God short acting.
I'm short lived.

1409
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:16,441
Um,
it was,

1410
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:18,290
it was actually a horrible experience 
that really,

1411
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:19,380
that was my worst.
Yeah.

1412
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:21,070
I had a great experience.
Yeah.

1413
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,160
Yeah.
So what was wrong with it?

1414
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,680
So I,
you know,

1415
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:28,290
you take like one puff and before you 
exhale,

1416
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,970
um,
I was,

1417
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:31,680
I mean this is a synthetic version two,
right?

1418
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:33,290
I was taking the venom.
Um,

1419
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,230
you're shut out of a cannon and there's 
no lead up,

1420
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:37,940
no warm up.
It's like fun.

1421
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:43,410
And I felt like I was actually like 
strapped to the outside of a rocket,

1422
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:44,303
you know,
going through space and through clouds 

1423
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:48,480
and like the g forces pulling down my 
cheeks.

1424
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,480
And it was just this mental storm 
without any nothing to Orient Myself.

1425
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:57,180
There was no space,
there was no time,

1426
01:04:57,181 --> 01:05:00,360
there was no self.
And um,

1427
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:01,763
it was just unendurable this punishing 
roar and my years and someone who had 

1428
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:06,474
done it said,
eventually it's like a takeoff and you 

1429
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:09,930
get into orbit and it,
and it's,

1430
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:14,850
it's very nice at that point.
But what happened with me is I had the,

1431
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,790
I had the,
I mean I felt like it was like,

1432
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,790
the metaphor I use in the book is like I
said,

1433
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:24,730
I can't explain this.
You can't tell a story without place,

1434
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,110
time and character.
Right.

1435
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,720
I had none of those.
Right.

1436
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:28,773
Um,
it was just this in Kuwait energy and I 

1437
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,330
said it was,
it was like the before the big bang.

1438
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:35,230
You remember that?
Well,

1439
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,900
obviously nobody does.
Yeah.

1440
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,980
But there was pure energy and no matter 
yet,

1441
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:39,910
and no time yet.

1442
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,020
I mean,
that's where I was.

1443
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,240
And um,
it was horrible.

1444
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,250
It was terrifying.
And I thought I was dying,

1445
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,930
but then you,
you come down,

1446
01:05:47,931 --> 01:05:48,764
it was kind of a suborbital flight.
And then I started coming down and 

1447
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:53,890
suddenly I could feel,
oh,

1448
01:05:53,891 --> 01:05:55,150
I've got a body,
you know,

1449
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,980
it was touching my legs.
I have a body and like,

1450
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:58,720
oh there's a,
there's a floor,

1451
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,100
there's their space.
And then there's time and the,

1452
01:06:02,101 --> 01:06:02,934
and the universe kind of reconsolidated.
And I had this feeling of incredible 

1453
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,520
gratitude,
not just for being alive,

1454
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,400
which all of us have had at one point or
another,

1455
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,413
but that anything existed I was,
I was grateful for the fact that there 

1456
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:19,600
is something and not nothing,
because I'd seen what nothing was lying.

1457
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,530
And so in that sense it ended up kind of
positive,

1458
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:25,960
but you wouldn't want to go there to 
have that experience.

1459
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:26,794
So subsequently somebody said to me a 
very experienced psychonaut who I was 

1460
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:33,730
telling the story too.
He said you didn't have enough.

1461
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,680
I was just going to tell you.
Really?

1462
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:36,850
Yeah,
cause you only took one hit.

1463
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,450
Usually take three,
you take three and the rocket lied.

1464
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:43,410
The rocket ride leads you somewhere.
It takes you too.

1465
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,650
You take three,
three,

1466
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:45,540
three,
three,

1467
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:47,430
three in a row.
Take a same time,

1468
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:50,290
blow it out.
Take a big one below it out.

1469
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,570
Take a big one,
and as you're taking the third one,

1470
01:06:52,571 --> 01:06:53,404
you're already seeing the world 
crystallize in front of you had already 

1471
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:58,390
starts turning into geometric patterns.
He put the pipe down,

1472
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:03,520
lay back in the chair and just shoot off
to the center of the universe.

1473
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:06,310
The terrifying thing is you cease to 
exist like,

1474
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,203
yeah,
it's the one drug that I've ever taken 

1475
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,120
where you don't,
you're not there anymore.

1476
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,930
Yeah.
Uh,

1477
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:11,763
even an end dimethyl trip to Maine,
which is the difference between five 

1478
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:15,634
methoxy diamond field trip to me is just
an oxygen oxygen molecule attached to 

1479
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:19,354
it,
but [inaudible] and dimethyltryptamine 

1480
01:07:20,711 --> 01:07:24,850
is incredibly visually stimulating.
Five methoxy is not,

1481
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,080
it's just white.

1482
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:28,290
It was white.
It was definitely,

1483
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:31,420
I don't know how I could have taken 
three hits because I hadn't excelled.

1484
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,850
The first one when I was gone,

1485
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:33,471
you said,
well,

1486
01:07:33,471 --> 01:07:34,880
I don't know what you're,
I was,

1487
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,580
I only did the synthetic version of it 
and you're doing this.

1488
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,740
And the person I know who

1489
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,633
did the synthetic version had a very 
different experience and they felt like 

1490
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,800
they were installed in the firmament as 
this happy star,

1491
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,480
but I didn't get there.
So it,

1492
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,670
who knows I did something wrong.
Okay.

1493
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:49,683
I don't think you did.
I just think you had a different 

1494
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:53,800
experience.
And I mean I've obviously,

1495
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:55,520
there's gotta be some sort of chemical 
different,

1496
01:07:55,521 --> 01:07:56,354
you know,
you're probably getting other things in 

1497
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:01,120
that frog venom as well as pure dmt.
That may be it.

1498
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:01,810
Yeah.
I mean there's all,

1499
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:06,280
I don't know the answer to the fucking 
frog spit do you,

1500
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,430
by the way,
no carbs.

1501
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,730
No frogs were harmed in the making of 
this drug.

1502
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:13,210
It's excreted on the outside of their 
body and what most people can milk them.

1503
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,011
Yeah.
You,

1504
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:14,844
you rub them on a glass and then let it 
dry off and then you scrape it off the 

1505
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:21,080
glass and crystal get,
yeah.

1506
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,553
You just kind of squeeze them.
And then it sprays the glass and 

1507
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:26,900
overnight it turns into it looks like 
brown sugar.

1508
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,310
Yeah.
It's an amazing thing.

1509
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:30,890
You're the first person who knows 
anything about it that I've had that who

1510
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:35,460
is going to be able to buy it used to be
able to buy legal time recently 2011 jug

1511
01:08:35,461 --> 01:08:36,110
of this shit.

1512
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,610
Oh my God.
Offline.

1513
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:39,530
Uh,
I bought it from some company,

1514
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:42,320
American chemical company or something 
and they send it to you.

1515
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:43,154
And I had enough to get the entire state
of California high for several days 

1516
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:47,823
because it doesn't take much,
but it's not something you want to do 

1517
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:50,864
very often.
I don't think it has the same kind of 

1518
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:53,744
healing properties because you're not 
bringing back information that's usable 

1519
01:08:56,601 --> 01:08:58,070
bag a lot.
Yeah.

1520
01:08:58,071 --> 01:08:58,904
I brought back a lot about myself and 
one of the things that I realized as I 

1521
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:05,630
was,
I recorded what I would do is post trip,

1522
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,290
I'd hit a tape recorder right when I 
became conscious again and start talking

1523
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:10,124
about the experience and what I remember
saying about the five methoxy dmt 

1524
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:14,984
experiences.
Like,

1525
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:20,260
as I'm trying to recount what happened,
I feel my ego trying to retake,

1526
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:22,994
hold the situation and even use words in
a way that might impress you with my 

1527
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:29,990
ability to describe things or as you 
know,

1528
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:30,824
as a professional comedian too,
I was aware that like a lot of what 

1529
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:34,394
you're doing,
you're saying things in a way that's 

1530
01:09:35,961 --> 01:09:39,140
pleasing to people so that they get 
excited about hearing you talk.

1531
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,360
And I was very aware of that while I was
doing that.

1532
01:09:41,361 --> 01:09:42,194
I'm saying,
I'm saying I'm trying to explain things 

1533
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:45,014
that are not possible to explain because
the words that we're using were all 

1534
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:53,090
invented for a world that doesn't exist 
in the DMT dimension.

1535
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,670
And it's once,
once you break through,

1536
01:09:55,790 --> 01:10:00,790
it is so profoundly alien that any words
liberating.

1537
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:01,930
Yes.
Yeah.

1538
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:03,710
Well in a way,
I mean it may,

1539
01:10:03,711 --> 01:10:07,340
it may be really truly realize that we 
are in a soup of,

1540
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,760
of Adams and that it's not,
yeah.

1541
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:13,250
There's not like Michael Pollan,
Joe Rogan and Jamie Vernon in a room.

1542
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,490
Here's a wood table.
There's oxygen in between.

1543
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:16,460
No,
this,

1544
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:20,810
we're in a,
an universal stew of particles.

1545
01:10:20,811 --> 01:10:23,390
Yeah.
And it breaks those particles down,

1546
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:27,140
or at least it gives you a view into 
that and you cease to exist,

1547
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:27,974
which is the most bizarre thing because 
it's so similar to end and 

1548
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:35,360
dimethyltryptamine chemically,
but so different in the fact that you're

1549
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:40,010
not there while you're doing regular d n
and dimethyl trip to me,

1550
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:42,560
which is the active ingredient Iowasca 
if you'd done that,

1551
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:43,400
the pure version of it.

1552
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,440
No,
not the pure version.

1553
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:49,690
The pure version is like a very short,
much more intense Iowasca experience.

1554
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,930
I've never done Iowasca.
I've only done the dmt version,

1555
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,930
but the injection or no smoking it,
but when you,

1556
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:58,793
what you get out of it is you're there 
while this is happening and you're just 

1557
01:11:02,601 --> 01:11:05,250
blown away and you're like,
I can ask drew and I don't see,

1558
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,740
but there's all these entities are 
trying to calm you down,

1559
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:10,280
relax,
relax,

1560
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:12,290
take it in,
settle down,

1561
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:15,550
settle down.
They're all trying to calm you down and,

1562
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,021
and,
and,

1563
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,670
and alleviate.
Yeah.

1564
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:18,504
It's,
it's,

1565
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,980
it's weird,
you know,

1566
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:22,260
and they're also fucking with you.
Like they give you the finger.

1567
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:24,540
Like I had a bunch of jokers that were 
like dancing around me,

1568
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:28,560
giving me the finger machine elves to,
I don't believe in that thing.

1569
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:29,580
I don't know what that is.

1570
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,880
Like Mckenna had those experiences of 
machine elves.

1571
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,410
I never saw,
I saw it.

1572
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,333
What I described is complex geometric 
patterns that are made out of love and 

1573
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:39,860
understanding.
They,

1574
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:40,843
they seem to me to be like the building 
blocks of the soul all around you all 

1575
01:11:44,521 --> 01:11:46,920
the time.
Like some just gigantic,

1576
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:52,200
impossibly large,
infinite well of souls.

1577
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,690
Just these things dancing around you and
they were,

1578
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,810
they were never one thing.
They would be one thing for a second and

1579
01:11:57,811 --> 01:12:01,650
they change into something else and they
change it to something different and the

1580
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:06,651
more profound the experiences God,
the more profound the next one would be.

1581
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,420
And they kept saying like,
look at this,

1582
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,560
look at this.
Like the,

1583
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:13,410
but the words weren't real words.
That's the other thing.

1584
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:16,890
It's like I'm saying the words,
look at this and I would have that in my

1585
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:19,230
head,
but I never heard anybody say it.

1586
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:21,600
It was almost like it was triggering 
those,

1587
01:12:21,601 --> 01:12:23,760
the,
the concept of those words in my mind,

1588
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:24,630
right,
right.

1589
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,060
It's,
it's pre or post linguistics,

1590
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:29,030
some of these experiences.
So when you,

1591
01:12:29,031 --> 01:12:30,690
you,
you asked about dumb moments though,

1592
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:33,030
but um,
you know,

1593
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:38,031
I had one where I had this like 
cascading since flood of love tour.

1594
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:39,463
I was thinking about my family,
I was thinking about my son and my wife 

1595
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:44,700
and my parents and,
and you know,

1596
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:45,623
it sounds like so banal and one of the 
things that happens is that these 

1597
01:12:49,771 --> 01:12:52,770
platitudes that love is the most 
important thing there is.

1598
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:53,610
Okay.
Take that for,

1599
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:58,050
except that could be on a hallmark card,
but suddenly it's infused with like,

1600
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:00,240
yes,
that is so profound.

1601
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,310
And you know what?
It is profound.

1602
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,713
But we have these defenses against 
seeing it that way because we've heard 

1603
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:08,520
it so many times,
you know,

1604
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:10,890
a sense of banality is just from 
repetition,

1605
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,070
but you're put back in touch with,
you know,

1606
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:14,904
a platitude is a truth that's been 
drained of all emotion and the emotion 

1607
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:22,830
comes back and it becomes really 
powerful.

1608
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:23,663
So I,
there's a whole riff in the book about 

1609
01:13:25,021 --> 01:13:26,100
platitudes and like,
oh,

1610
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:29,550
we have to rethink these platitudes so 
it can make you sound like an idiot.

1611
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:33,540
Um,
but is that right or is that right?

1612
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,470
You know,
and I,

1613
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,313
and I actually think the experience is 
more truthful than the ironic cynical 

1614
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:41,340
perspective that we bring to it in our 
everyday lives,

1615
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:42,174
which is a defense against powerful 
emotion and being overwhelmed every day 

1616
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:47,430
by wow,
love,

1617
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,140
you know,
whatever it is.

1618
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,790
So you,
you,

1619
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:52,800
you end up revaluing those kinds of 
things.

1620
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:53,634
And that the,
so that was a really important takeaway 

1621
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:55,674
from me.
The other was having an experience of 

1622
01:13:57,001 --> 01:13:57,834
ego dissolution that which can be scary,
can also be very blissful if it's then 

1623
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:06,390
followed by emerging with nature or 
other people.

1624
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,230
And I do think that is the therapeutic 
agent in these,

1625
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,130
in the people who are

1626
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:12,963
healed,
that our ego does keep us from 

1627
01:14:15,821 --> 01:14:20,680
perceiving certain things and it 
enforces really destructive stories.

1628
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:21,514
We tell ourselves like,
I can't get through this day without a 

1629
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:26,500
drink.
I'm unworthy of love.

1630
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:27,281
Uh,
you know,

1631
01:14:27,281 --> 01:14:31,210
the voice of self criticism all.
And we get trapped in these loops.

1632
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,553
And especially as we get older.
And that's one of the reasons I think 

1633
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:34,924
psychedelics are actually more valuable 
the older you get because we are 

1634
01:14:38,411 --> 01:14:39,244
creatures of habit.
And by now we have these mental 

1635
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:42,790
algorithms that organize our,
our,

1636
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:45,460
our response to everything.
And sure,

1637
01:14:45,461 --> 01:14:47,530
that's very efficient.
Um,

1638
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,423
but it blinds you to experience it,
blinds you to the everyday wonders and 

1639
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,430
Psychedelics,
you know,

1640
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,790
softens those habits and,
and,

1641
01:14:56,791 --> 01:15:01,300
and helps you get out of those grooves.
And for me that was really useful.

1642
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,680
And uh,
it's only,

1643
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:07,240
I think it's the experience of ego to 
solution that allows you to,

1644
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,600
cause your ego enforces those habits and
you get a little break.

1645
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,433
There's a beautiful metaphor.
One of the scientists I interviewed in 

1646
01:15:12,881 --> 01:15:14,820
the book,
a Dutchman working in,

1647
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,450
uh,
in imperial college in London.

1648
01:15:16,451 --> 01:15:17,284
He said,
think of your mind is a hill covered in 

1649
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:20,434
snow?
And your thoughts are sleds going down 

1650
01:15:22,571 --> 01:15:24,940
that hill.
And after a while,

1651
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:26,440
after a lot of thoughts have gone that 
hill,

1652
01:15:26,441 --> 01:15:27,274
there'll be these grooves.
And then getting to get deeper and 

1653
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:29,560
deeper.
And to a certain point,

1654
01:15:29,561 --> 01:15:32,500
you can't go down the hill without 
slipping into those grooves.

1655
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:35,050
That's who we are is where like,
you know,

1656
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:37,090
at this age and,
um,

1657
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:40,720
what psychedelics do,
he said his is flattened the snow,

1658
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:45,550
lots of fresh powder and you can then 
take the slit anyway you want to go.

1659
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:46,443
That's a great way of describing it.
I've always talked about predetermined 

1660
01:15:49,451 --> 01:15:51,520
patterns and grooves that people fall 
into.

1661
01:15:51,521 --> 01:15:53,500
So it's amazing hearing him say it that 
way,

1662
01:15:53,501 --> 01:15:55,630
but that's a much better way of 
describing it.

1663
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:58,600
Like snow,
the sliding these thoughts down,

1664
01:15:58,601 --> 01:16:01,750
these already existing patterns.
That's amazing.

1665
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:04,650
That's,
you know what you said about love and,

1666
01:16:04,651 --> 01:16:06,190
and,
and being cynical.

1667
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:07,024
That's so important too,
because there's something that's 

1668
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:14,590
something that people are,
they avoid sincerity.

1669
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:15,843
Like there's something about it that it 
makes you too vulnerable or too open to 

1670
01:16:21,101 --> 01:16:25,060
criticism or to open to ridicule.
And we're worried about being sincere.

1671
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:27,910
And I do think that that's one of the 
primary benefits of psychedelics.

1672
01:16:27,911 --> 01:16:28,270
Yeah.
Well,

1673
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:29,103
we live in an ironic culture and we 
defend ourselves against strong 

1674
01:16:31,571 --> 01:16:35,560
experience or self exposure by adopting 
this stance.

1675
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:36,610
That's ironic.
And,

1676
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:38,050
uh,
cool.

1677
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,280
And,
um,

1678
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,040
psychedelics is not a cool experience.
It's the opposite.

1679
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:43,900
Well,
it's cool when it's over.

1680
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,060
Yeah.
But yeah,

1681
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:47,380
it's,
it's serious stuff.

1682
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:48,290
And,
um,

1683
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,830
how much did you pay attention to 
Mckenna's theory?

1684
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:51,641
Uh,
about,

1685
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:52,474
uh,
the evolution of the human brain of the 

1686
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:57,490
stoned ape theory that yeah,
I looked at it,

1687
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:01,600
um,
but I found I didn't find it persuasive.

1688
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,060
And in fact,
if you press Terence Mckenna,

1689
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:06,100
he didn't find an entirely persuasive,
it's a very,

1690
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:08,770
it's an interesting speculation.
It's kind of a mind game.

1691
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,130
I don't

1692
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,963
see how I can see how uh,
psychedelics would influence the mind 

1693
01:17:14,691 --> 01:17:15,230
and,
and,

1694
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:18,300
and,
and create new ideas,

1695
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:20,310
new memes,
um,

1696
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:22,430
and Mike contribute to language.
Um,

1697
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:23,453
but how does it get into the genes?
That's what I had to change the genes 

1698
01:17:26,311 --> 01:17:28,860
cause he said it changed us at the 
genetic level.

1699
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,473
I see.
Psychedelics is having had a profound 

1700
01:17:32,161 --> 01:17:32,994
effect at the level of cultural 
evolution that there are lots of 

1701
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:40,940
interesting innovations that people who 
had psychedelic experience introduced to

1702
01:17:42,151 --> 01:17:44,370
our culture.
We talked about religion earlier.

1703
01:17:44,371 --> 01:17:45,510
That could be one.
A,

1704
01:17:45,511 --> 01:17:47,460
I had a wonderful interview with Stewart
brand,

1705
01:17:47,461 --> 01:17:50,370
the founder of the whole earth catalog 
and his insight.

1706
01:17:50,371 --> 01:17:52,540
He had this profound insight,
um,

1707
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:57,000
during a psychedelic trip on the roof of
his house in North Beach.

1708
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:59,460
And he saw the curvature of the earth in
a way he hadn't before.

1709
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,481
And he said,
God,

1710
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:02,370
if we could have a phone,
this is 1966,

1711
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,100
we had never seen a picture of the earth
from space yet.

1712
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,353
And he said,
if we had a picture of the earth from 

1713
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:07,974
space,
and we could see it as this round space 

1714
01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:11,670
ship,
that would change everything.

1715
01:18:11,671 --> 01:18:13,650
Because if you think of the earth is 
flat,

1716
01:18:13,651 --> 01:18:16,740
as most of us instinctively do,
it's endless.

1717
01:18:16,741 --> 01:18:18,600
There's endless resources.
Uh,

1718
01:18:18,601 --> 01:18:20,760
you don't have to worry about limits in 
any way.

1719
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:23,010
But if we had that image and he 
realized,

1720
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:23,903
we,
I have to start a campaign to get NASA 

1721
01:18:25,141 --> 01:18:27,240
to turn the cameras around.
They're on their way to the moon,

1722
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,670
show us the earth from space.
And he said,

1723
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,890
I'm going to make a campaign.
I know,

1724
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:32,971
and he's,
you know,

1725
01:18:32,971 --> 01:18:35,070
this is not an LSD.
I'll make a button,

1726
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:37,980
very important medium in 1966,
I'll make a button.

1727
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,083
And what should the button say?
It should be a little paranoid to get 

1728
01:18:40,921 --> 01:18:41,754
people's attention.
Why haven't they shown us an image of 

1729
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:45,450
the earth from space?

1730
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,320
Yeah.
That's what he would do.

1731
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:49,260
And he started a campaign.
He started selling these buttons and the

1732
01:18:49,261 --> 01:18:52,560
campaign got in the newspapers and it 
goes viral as you know,

1733
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:53,394
as viral as you could get in 1966 and 
two years later and NASA produced that 

1734
01:18:57,871 --> 01:18:58,704
image and he put it on the whole earth 
catalog and that image galvanize the 

1735
01:19:01,831 --> 01:19:02,664
environmental movement.
So it's those kinds of memes that 

1736
01:19:05,551 --> 01:19:08,850
psychedelics introduces into culture and
that changes culture,

1737
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,130
that image changed culture.
Um,

1738
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,080
and I think there are hundreds of them.
I mean,

1739
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:17,250
Steve Jobs talked about his use of LSD 
is very important to his,

1740
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,020
uh,
formative experience.

1741
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:19,854
And in fact,
there's a whole tradition of computer 

1742
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:24,540
engineers going back to the 50s using 
lsd that I wrote about in the book.

1743
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:25,823
So,
but I don't see how we were selected 

1744
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:32,400
genetically because of the,
there was an advantage to the people who

1745
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:34,720
were taking a lot of psychedelics.
Um,

1746
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,800
that's where he was at me.
Maybe I'm misrepresenting it.

1747
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,753
His theory is that it coincides with 
climate change and these lower hominids 

1748
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,650
experiencing experimenting with 
different food sources.

1749
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:49,950
So as the rain forest receded into 
grasslands,

1750
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:55,080
they started experimenting by flipping 
over cow patties and finding grubs and,

1751
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:57,810
and perhaps even mushrooms that were 
growing on these cow patties.

1752
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:01,410
And his theory was that there's a bunch 
of different benefits.

1753
01:20:01,411 --> 01:20:05,450
One low doses of silicide but have been 
shown to increased visual acuity.

1754
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,310
The hunting dogs in certain cultures.

1755
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,150
Yes.
Yeah.

1756
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:09,983
Make you a better hunter,
make you more in tune with what you're 

1757
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:12,340
doing,
um,

1758
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,223
that it would make you more,
it would a central nervous system 

1759
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:18,270
arousal including sexual arousal.
It make you more horny,

1760
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:20,820
which would make you productive,
appropriate more often.

1761
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,073
And that the,
the very unusual effect that psilocybin 

1762
01:20:26,911 --> 01:20:27,744
has on the mind could have led to 
language and could have also led to the 

1763
01:20:30,391 --> 01:20:33,030
expansion of neurons.
That language to me,

1764
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,890
brain out of cultural evolution.
Sure.

1765
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,753
Yeah.
The doubling of the human brain size 

1766
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:37,741
though,
was it?

1767
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:39,960
The particular thing is that it 
coincided,

1768
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:42,280
according to the Mckenna,
it's been there.

1769
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:44,100
There's a lot of people that disagree 
with him,

1770
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,550
but his brother makes a very compelling 
case for him and his brother Dennis,

1771
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:49,890
who's still alive and was a brilliant,
brilliant guy.

1772
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:50,933
He talked about it on this podcast.
He talked about his take on the stone 

1773
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:57,420
Arab or a stoned ape theory 
scientifically,

1774
01:20:57,421 --> 01:20:59,610
why he believes it's really what 
happened,

1775
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,300
but that it does coincide with the 
change in climate of these,

1776
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,040
these,
you know,

1777
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:05,903
eight black people trying out different 
things and that the doubling of the 

1778
01:21:08,611 --> 01:21:10,740
human brain size over a period of 2 
million years,

1779
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,110
it was like one of the greatest 
mysteries in the entire fossil record.

1780
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,550
Their alternative theories.
I mean,

1781
01:21:14,551 --> 01:21:15,384
I wrote it up.
One of my last big all coincided maybe 

1782
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:18,840
cooking with fire.
Yes.

1783
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:19,674
You can explain the increase in the 
brain size because you get more 

1784
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:24,060
nutritional value from cooked food,
the throwing arm,

1785
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,280
uh,
the,

1786
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:25,861
the,
uh,

1787
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:26,694
the desire to hunt all these different 
animals and the calculating all these 

1788
01:21:29,131 --> 01:21:30,840
different ways to do that.
And communication.

1789
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:32,003
I think there's cooperation.
A bunch of coinciding fat and it may 

1790
01:21:35,071 --> 01:21:36,090
well be that,
that,

1791
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,670
uh,
people were eating everything right?

1792
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,590
Our ancestors,
it's amazing what they ate.

1793
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:41,483
And uh,
and no doubt they ate psychedelic 

1794
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:44,820
mushrooms and no doubt.
I mean,

1795
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:45,654
he also believed that language was a 
form of synesthesia in the way that 

1796
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:52,160
synesthesia you can smell a musical note
or something like that,

1797
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,290
that you're taking a sound,
a meaningless sound,

1798
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,430
uh,
you know,

1799
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:57,610
um,
and,

1800
01:21:57,650 --> 01:22:02,650
and you're attaching it to a concept 
that maybe that happened on Psilocybin,

1801
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,950
but a bunch of ideas that never panned 
out.

1802
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,230
He was,
he was,

1803
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:09,390
he was in high or audibly creative 
person and yeah.

1804
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:10,021
And,
uh,

1805
01:22:10,021 --> 01:22:11,250
and,
and they're all,

1806
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:12,373
you know,
really interesting to think about some 

1807
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:14,844
of them.
I think you could probably discredit 

1808
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:19,710
based on what we understand about genes 
and evolution,

1809
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:22,950
but others are just really provocative.
That's where his brother comes in.

1810
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:23,511
Yes.
His brothers,

1811
01:22:23,511 --> 01:22:25,560
his brother's a scientist,
strict scientists.

1812
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:26,403
It doesn't,
he doesn't tolerate any of the woo woo 

1813
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,900
and straight and he's skeptical of his 
brother's idea is to open.

1814
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:33,330
Yeah.
I mean loved his brother,

1815
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:33,981
but he was like,
oh,

1816
01:22:33,981 --> 01:22:35,570
there's a lot of things that weren't 
really accurate,

1817
01:22:35,571 --> 01:22:37,440
but also terence Mckenna to,
we'd say,

1818
01:22:37,441 --> 01:22:38,030
well,
you know,

1819
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:42,390
just putting these ideas out there.
The guy was a constant pot user.

1820
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:45,360
He was constantly doing psychedelics and
really good talker.

1821
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,830
I mean,
he would have a podcast now,

1822
01:22:46,831 --> 01:22:47,520
right?
Oh,

1823
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,450
it would be amazing.

1824
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,350
Yeah.
Yeah,

1825
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:50,710
for sure.
I promote the shit out.

1826
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:52,780
I would too.
Yeah.

1827
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,170
I mean,
he was a fun guy to listen to talk and,

1828
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,033
uh,
there's a,

1829
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:57,263
there's a podcast called the psychedelic
salon that my friend Lorenzo hosts that 

1830
01:23:00,421 --> 01:23:04,680
has pretty much every terence Mckenna 
lecture and speeches ever done,

1831
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,790
available for free.
You can download it.

1832
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:10,360
And Lorenzo is taking these and 
digitally remastered them to,

1833
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:12,700
the sound is better.
And it's really awesome that,

1834
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:13,960
that,
that he's got this resource.

1835
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:17,350
But the idea that these,
uh,

1836
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:21,010
lower hominids experienced ancient 
hominids experienced,

1837
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:21,903
experimented rather with silicide,
but then this was what advanced culture 

1838
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:29,260
or advanced language advanced their 
understanding of each other.

1839
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:31,090
It's a very,
very compelling idea.

1840
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:31,811
Yeah,
it is.

1841
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:32,644
And I think,
I mean the way I think about drugs like 

1842
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,990
second alex in evolution in the same 
way,

1843
01:23:37,991 --> 01:23:38,824
like in genetic evolution,
radiation causes mutations and some of 

1844
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:44,410
those mutations turn out to be really 
valuable,

1845
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,120
you know,
purely by accident.

1846
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:51,121
Some great new trait is introduced to 
the species and it increases fitness and

1847
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:55,420
that person or that individual lives on 
in the cultural realm,

1848
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:56,493
psychedelics are like radiation there 
mutagens they create change variation 

1849
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:03,930
and that advances cultural evolution.
Um,

1850
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:07,480
all that variation,
all those wild ideas,

1851
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:10,390
99% of them are stupid and useless.
I'll bet.

1852
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,780
But that 1% can change the world.
Yeah,

1853
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,760
absolutely.
All right,

1854
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,750
let's let you go cause I know you gotta 
get Outta here,

1855
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,450
but I wish I had more time because we've
got a lot more to talk about.

1856
01:24:19,451 --> 01:24:21,280
But I'll come back in town.
Please do.

1857
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:22,810
Please do.
And the name of your book.

1858
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:24,760
Once again,
how would it change your mind,

1859
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:28,570
what the new science of psychedelics is 
teaching us about consciousness,

1860
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,130
dying,
the addiction,

1861
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:30,964
depression and transcendence.
And is it available in audio form as 

1862
01:24:33,191 --> 01:24:33,760
well?
Yes.

1863
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,440
Yeah.
I and I recorded the audio book.

1864
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,720
Excellent.
I'm so happy to hear you say that.

1865
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:40,180
I hate it when other people read 
people's books.

1866
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:41,043
I did too.
And they told me my first couple of 

1867
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:43,644
bucks,
now you've got to have an actor to do 

1868
01:24:44,111 --> 01:24:45,550
it.
And people complain.

1869
01:24:45,551 --> 01:24:46,570
They said,
that's not you.

1870
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:49,270
So now I insist under it.
It takes a week out of my life.

1871
01:24:49,271 --> 01:24:50,071
Each time.
It's,

1872
01:24:50,071 --> 01:24:51,730
it's not easy,
but,

1873
01:24:51,731 --> 01:24:53,220
uh,
I'm very proud of this audio books,

1874
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:54,580
so I hope people will check.
That's awesome.

1875
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:55,540
Thank you very much,
Michael.

1876
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:56,261
Thank you,
Joe.

1877
01:24:56,261 --> 01:24:57,970
This was a pleasure.
Michael Pollan.

1878
01:24:57,971 --> 01:24:58,804
Ladies and gentlemen.
