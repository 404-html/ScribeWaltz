1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,680
Liquid insulated walls put in five,
four,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,970
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,730
one.
Someone's got a new netflix show.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,740
I couldn't think of any other way to 
start.

5
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:20,981
Officer of what I thought.
Oh,

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,540
so you do have new netflix specials?
I do.

7
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,800
I don't want this to be like an 
interview.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,350
No,
but,

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,050
but I,
but I,

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,610
but I like it.
I'm actually proud of it,

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,580
you know,
it's like I'm still proud of it,

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,380
you know,
usually a certain amount of time will go

13
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:36,460
by where I'm like,
oh,

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,740
like my mom.
Even now I've gotten it better on the 

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:41,740
road because,
you know,

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:41,740
I was,
you know,

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,561
the day after you shoot it,
you go out on the road and you're a 

18
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:47,410
murderer and you have a little fun with 
it and then you go.

19
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:52,411
I.
But I'm still proud of it and it was my 

20
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:52,411
favorite thing.
I've it,

21
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,970
the guy did.
Jeff Rowe is the guy who,

22
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,110
and Scott Moran,
but just everything I wanted,

23
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:59,080
they did it perfect.
That's awesome.

24
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,920
The look the way I did it at the lyric 
but,

25
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,740
and the lyric is great,
but there's no desk is the lyric in La,

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,060
the lyric is in La.
It's like at Melrose and melrose and 

27
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,701
libray pretty,
but they sort of used it as a shell and 

28
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:15,130
it's already a pretty cool club.

29
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,050
But you know,
the,

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,840
the biggest compliment I got,
someone said,

31
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,850
you know,
what's weird about your special I want 

32
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,550
to go there and it doesn't exist a what 
it looked like,

33
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,270
where is that?
They had good set people date.

34
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:31,270
It just looked like a cool jazz club in 
New York City.

35
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:34,410
That was maybe but not.
It wasn't small because it was an after.

36
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,520
You know,
sometimes it's small but it's shitty.

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,720
It's the look and it's cool.
It's sort of a,

38
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,020
what's the word?
Kitchen?

39
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,080
Yeah.
I don't know what that word is.

40
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,120
I mean,
and that's the look they want.

41
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:46,240
I didn't want that.
Not that I think that's bad because some

42
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:51,241
people have done that really well and 
it's a cool way to see a comedian just 

43
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:51,310
in a cool little raw space,
but I want it small.

44
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,220
But like,
like it's a jazz club in New York City,

45
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:57,970
but it's like 150 bucks to get in and it
holds 100 people.

46
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,790
It's like that type of thing.
Run like a theater.

47
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,940
Well,
you helped design one of my all time 

48
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:05,940
favorite clubs,
helium and Philly.

49
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,240
You helped design that place,
didn't you?

50
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,510
Well,
when Mark Mark,

51
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,260
uh,
he acme at Lewis,

52
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:14,770
Lisa,
you know,

53
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,110
touchy feely,
he'll probably love to give you advice.

54
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,620
So when it was just a warehouse like 
cement and I met him down there and he's

55
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:28,831
like,
I'm thinking of open up a club and you 

56
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:28,831
know,
I told them a lot of stuff I wrote,

57
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:28,831
I,
I,

58
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,460
I made like well email,
you know,

59
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,010
like six pages of,
you know,

60
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:34,930
here's the very detailed things and you 
know,

61
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:37,240
what?
He listened to a lot of it.

62
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,910
Like I give him credit,
you know,

63
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,980
that's awesome.
Great fucking club.

64
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,010
Like there's something about those 
intimate spaces.

65
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,040
Like,
one of the things that I've noticed when

66
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,680
I take people on the road with me and 
said,

67
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,040
guys who have never worked at theater,
like it takes a few tries to get.

68
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,670
They go,
oh,

69
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,260
okay,
this is a whole different thing.

70
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,710
There's so many people here.
You've got to kind of project to them.

71
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,140
It's like a different thing.
It's not,

72
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,810
you don't feel them the way you feel 
them at the,

73
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,480
in the Oh,
are on like a Wednesday night,

74
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,370
right?
Or um,

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,640
comedy works in Denver where they're on 
top of you.

76
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,110
You're like,
you feel the people,

77
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,220
they're more,
right?

78
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Yeah.
And then you learn it pretty quick 

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:20,640
though.
Yeah.

80
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,600
You know,
do you ever do the belly room at the 

81
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:22,600
store?
I've done it a few times.

82
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,070
And of course it's,
I love little rooms.

83
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,690
Like I love like woman.
I used to do tempe.

84
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,860
You always did that side room on 
purpose.

85
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,050
They will do the big place.
But with the side place,

86
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,790
you know,
not to get too,

87
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,850
but you get it.
I was jealous.

88
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,800
I remember I came over,
I was in the other,

89
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,630
the regular one,
which is great.

90
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,940
I was having a good time is but the one 
one,

91
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,620
joey and I went next door and watched 
you.

92
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,470
I was like,
this is better as well.

93
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,720
Even in DC,
which I think is a good example.

94
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:57,721
DC has a 60 seat room and whenever I'm 
in there I go,

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,640
I give it.
I had a two piece band playing with a 

96
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,660
black tablecloth on all the tables,
the lights or Gel blue,

97
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:09,661
so now people are turning corner into 
this thick blue room with two guys with 

98
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,940
black suits playing jazz as they're 
being seeded in eating.

99
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,140
So now I don't feel like it's an 
afterthought what you just said and I'll

100
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:22,141
take it as a compliment.
The other comedian that's in the main 

101
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:22,141
room there,
which is awesome room,

102
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:23,860
but you look into the little room and 
you're like,

103
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:27,460
it just looks like something's going on 
and that's how I want it to look.

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,520
No,
it makes sense.

105
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:28,890
Yeah,
no,

106
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,730
it does make sense.
It's a.

107
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,340
it's more of a hang,
right?

108
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,430
The big show and your style so loose on 
stage like lends itself to intimacy.

109
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,610
It lends itself to those nice compact 
spot.

110
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,850
Do you ever do the Ice House that the 
annex room?

111
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,080
I mean not forever,
but.

112
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:47,980
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

113
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,080
The craziest.
The Ice House is about as deep as this 

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,080
room.
That's fucking.

115
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
It goes side to side a little bit.
I think the whole room,

116
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,220
that annex only gets,
what is it?

117
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:02,221
Like 70 people,
maybe 70 people and all the chairs are 

118
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:03,040
like facing the audience.
See that says,

119
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,530
oh no,
no,

120
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:03,810
no,
no,

121
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,570
no,
you're,

122
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:09,571
you're sitting here,
you're going to say goodbye to your 

123
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:11,191
friend for a little while,
like some of the Improv and then people 

124
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:16,261
were watching the show like this and 
they have to kind of turn to look past 

125
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:19,201
the person next to them.
They're trying to feed you food to like 

126
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:19,201
you're working in a half restaurant.

127
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:21,460
The thing about,
I will say this about a good club.

128
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:26,461
Most of the foods been served or I 
couldn't do what I'm about to tell you 

129
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:27,610
that I've done so that the club has to 
at least be good to go.

130
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:29,800
Now we get the food that we have,
food we can get out.

131
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,890
But the time the show started we tried 
to have the whole room service,

132
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,320
so in the event and like helium does 
that.

133
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Uh,
but so I started making this 

134
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,931
announcement and I would tell people 
because I do my own pre show 

135
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,721
announcement,
it has to do with what you said about 

136
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:45,721
when they're sitting sideways.
And I would just go real calm,

137
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:45,721
real.
I go.

138
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,400
Other than that folks,
hey now's a good time to turn your chair

139
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:53,401
around.
You're always going to have to annoy 

140
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:53,401
someone to the right or left you.
But now's the time to do it.

141
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,720
And once all the chairs are facing,
the sage will get this thing started.

142
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,040
Play a little house and you know what?
They wouldn't do

143
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,080
it,
but another 30 seconds I'd go.

144
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:05,230
So we're just waiting for all those 
chairs to get turned around and then 

145
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,391
we'll get it started.
So it looks like we're close to show 

146
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:07,391
time and the second time,
boom,

147
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:07,391
boom,
boom,

148
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:07,391
boom,
boom,

149
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:08,990
boom.
Every chair in the room they're like,

150
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,720
oh,
but you know,

151
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,990
I get it.
It's a pain in the ass.

152
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,420
And if I was in the audience I wouldn't 
want to turn my chair around.

153
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,970
But guess what,
once someone made me do it,

154
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,950
you'd enjoy the show better.
And they do.

155
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,390
We got,

156
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,590
you know this,
if you ever do those,

157
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,130
use those yonder bags,
those bags are.

158
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:26,800
And to make people put their cell phone 
in a bag.

159
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:31,801
Denver has them.
Denver uses them for all their shows 

160
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:31,801
now.
I started using them for all my show.

161
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,190
So you just accompany,
comes in and just does it for you?

162
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,160
Yeah,
you hire them,

163
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,710
they come in and then when they put the 
bag,

164
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,770
the phone in the bag,
they still hold onto their phone and 

165
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:43,770
they can leave the room.
If they get a phone call,

166
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,240
like you have a kid or something like 
that and someone's watching the kid.

167
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,920
You can always get out of the room,
make call,

168
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,560
but you can't call people when you're in
the room.

169
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:53,950
And I was having people calling people 
and talking on the phone.

170
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,951
You could see them talking on the phone 
while the show's going on and people 

171
00:06:58,951 --> 00:06:59,600
around them would be getting pissed off 
and uh,

172
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,770
someone on twitter comment on it and he 
just,

173
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,720
everyone's got their phones up and look,
I know I've done it too.

174
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,140
I'm totally a hypocrite.
When I saw honey honey with Gary Clark,

175
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,810
even performing this little tiny room in
downtown La was a midnight show and like

176
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:15,460
a Tuesday and I filmed it and I put it 
on my instagram.

177
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:20,461
So I know I'm a hypocrite,
but that was a rare occasion that it 

178
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,480
wasn't a comedy show.
It's like a comedy show.

179
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:24,850
You have to pay attention to what the 
fuck's going on.

180
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,530
If you,
if you're filming it,

181
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,330
you're definitely not paying full 
attention.

182
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,560
You're going to miss some stuff.
It's just not the same thing when you 

183
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,650
filming shit.
Like everybody is just,

184
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,470
even if you're not,
you're checking this and checking texts.

185
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:43,471
And boy,
we got a real addiction problem in this 

186
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:43,471
country with these,
these are new things.

187
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:44,290
Is your new object.

188
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,420
I,
I realize because I'm not delusional 

189
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,251
that the amount of it,
I can put most of it to breast with 

190
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:52,860
appreciate announcement where I'm at in 
my career.

191
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,350
But again,
as you get to different levels,

192
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:58,050
there's different intensity.
So I don't I get it.

193
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,330
But um,
the uh,

194
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,890
I,
I changed my pre show announcement when 

195
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:06,890
I went to see Brian Regan,
the person next to me,

196
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,920
I,
they were texting,

197
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,950
I couldn't hear them,
matter of fact even had their light 

198
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,950
down.
So you think,

199
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,980
well,
what could bother me?

200
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,040
And it did.
And it didn't matter if it was right or 

201
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,040
wrong,
I know what it was.

202
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,161
I wanted the person next to him and it'd
be loving him as much as I was loving 

203
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:26,601
him.
And the fact that I saw them on their 

204
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:26,601
phone,
on or even they weren't making a peep,

205
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:30,030
it started to bother the fuck out of me.
I was getting angry and then I went,

206
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:30,870
oh,
that's,

207
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,550
I'm going to do the same thing at my 
show.

208
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,320
I go,
don't turn your thing all the way down.

209
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:39,321
I go,
I know you think and you'll pull it out 

210
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:39,321
into your knee.
I go,

211
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:42,051
seriously,
if you pull your phone out after this 

212
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:42,051
announcement,
you,

213
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:45,230
you look like a dick.
I go and we're glad you're here and you 

214
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:50,931
know what it.
You just have to pick it out an 

215
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:50,931
announcement a little longer,
but it works.

216
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,780
I'm worried about people are really are.
This is a really new thing.

217
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,070
The more I'm thinking about it,
the more like looking

218
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,680
at your phone constantly.
It's really only 10 years old,

219
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,000
right?
Like 2008 ish.

220
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Then the iphone came around 2009 right 
before that people were a little text 

221
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,360
diy people.
Some people more tech savvy than others.

222
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:14,361
They really got into text messages,
but once that iphone came out and once 

223
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:17,190
people started doing a bunch of stuff 
and apps and stuff on your phone,

224
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,200
it changed the whole game.
You know?

225
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,930
I don't know,
with this topic,

226
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:26,070
if I'm like I could be way off or I 
could be off kilter the way I come to my

227
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,430
conclusion about like,
you know,

228
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,290
you know,
it is,

229
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,990
it is a weird thing and even me,
I could acknowledge it.

230
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:32,160
Otherwise,
if I don't acknowledge it,

231
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,290
you're never going to tell some of the 
opposing side if they don't think you 

232
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,891
get what you see it,
but it just seems like in the past now 

233
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:40,140
this could be different with.

234
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,170
No,
no snarkiness it.

235
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:42,960
Oh,
this could be a different thing.

236
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,470
Every time they think there's one of 
these things like TV radio too seems 

237
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,760
like when we get past,
oh,

238
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:52,650
I think we'll get past it.
You know what I mean?

239
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,300
I didn't think the world was going to 
explode,

240
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,920
but I'm worried about certain.
I'm not worried about the human race,

241
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,410
but I'm worried about the lives of 
certain people,

242
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,150
if that makes sense.
Because it's like saying like,

243
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,870
are you worried that cracks can destroy 
the human race?

244
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:11,871
No,
I'm not worried that crack is going to 

245
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:11,871
destroy it,
but I do think you can destroy the lives

246
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:14,100
of some people and I feel the same way 
about this.

247
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,900
Right?
Like the texting,

248
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,930
like it's not just that.
It's like being plugged into electronic 

249
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,150
to the point where that's where you're 
getting most of your stimuli from.

250
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,180
You're getting artificial stimuli.
My concern,

251
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,210
this is a real concern is that we're,
we're getting really into that and then 

252
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,920
we're going to let it take the next step
which is some sort of an implant.

253
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,160
I feel like this is,
we're in a movie within a movie about a 

254
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,761
person that becomes a machine and we're 
watching this rationalization process as

255
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:48,840
we slowly get more and more ingrained 
and interconnected with technology.

256
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,800
We'll definitely in our lifetime have 
somebody 100 percent.

257
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,040
I try like what you were just 
addressing.

258
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,800
Like we said before,
like I,

259
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,680
I catch myself and I really try.
Like if I had to give myself a grade on 

260
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,310
how much I've improved on,
like turning the phone off,

261
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,200
like loving it for what's great about 
it.

262
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,530
I give myself maybe a c minus,
but it means I've made some strides and 

263
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:12,540
like turning it off.

264
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,920
You're not enough.
Not Enough.

265
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:15,150
Not for.
Matter of fact.

266
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,360
I remember a week ago I was going into 
the grove and I went,

267
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,870
I'm not meeting anybody,
and I left my phone in the car.

268
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,280
It was strong,
move strong to ideas,

269
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,830
to ideas and I was high and I didn't 
want to write them down.

270
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:32,520
I went,
Oh shit.

271
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:34,290
That's the thing about leaving your 
phone in the car.

272
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,790
They'll take a picture or show someone a
picture or it doesn't have to always be.

273
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,470
But anyway,
I try to go and,

274
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,490
you know,
never,

275
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,580
never walking through,
never walking through a line that 

276
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:46,580
actually could encourage you to write.
Um,

277
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,420
you know,
you can just use hate writing,

278
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,790
but I mean saying you see,
you can only use your phone when you 

279
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,960
have a note or an idea.
That's the only time you could use it.

280
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,850
Well,
that's a loophole.

281
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Like I'm pretending that I don't even 
have this phone unless I need to make a 

282
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:02,880
note.
You know what?

283
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,680
I could put it on airplane mode.
You could put it on airplane mode,

284
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,130
then you still have all the other stuff.
Although a ways my pants down.

285
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,050
Oddly enough.
That's true.

286
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,220
Good conversation.
Right?

287
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:15,880
It does do that.
He pulled my pants up and shit.

288
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,110
That's why I like fanny packs.
People just mocked me relentlessly.

289
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,230
Can I tell you something?
There's no way I say it all the time 

290
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,750
when I go,
especially if I have my altoids and then

291
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:28,630
I have a pipe and then I go,
what the fuck?

292
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,800
You're a pipe guy.
Uh,

293
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,870
I still do for some reason.
They're old school.

294
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,800
It's all toys.
What else?

295
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,470
What do you do?
Like jazz clubs,

296
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,070
pipes?
What do you do?

297
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,360
Like what is your typical way?

298
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,030
Mostly joints or vape pens?
You know,

299
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:43,690
it's the rolling of the joint that I 
have a question for you.

300
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,640
Okay.
And I think you might know the answer.

301
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,340
I smoke.
I'm not going to like,

302
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,410
you know,
pressured,

303
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:54,450
blame you if something happens.
I know I can switch conversation 

304
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:54,450
completely,
but you might have.

305
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,690
I have two things I want to ask you a 
question.

306
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Did I interrupt?
No,

307
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,060
no,
no,

308
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,910
not at all.
Um,

309
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
I smoke now seven nights a week.
Wow.

310
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,070
So I'll have like a joint.
I would say if I had to put it in joint 

311
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,260
size,
maybe a joint per night.

312
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,840
So it's not that.
Not a tremendous amount.

313
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,970
None of that just at night.
Not that I'm saying I want a prize for 

314
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:15,970
that.
Just for me.

315
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,850
It works better at night,
but I say I quit smoking and I did.

316
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,780
I quit smoking.

317
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,240
I used to smoke around a pack and a half
a month is this as bad pack and a half a

318
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,980
month is pretty.
It wasn't horrendous,

319
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,400
but I quit because I had a of day.
Yeah.

320
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,110
Is this smoking seven nights with a 
joint as bad as when I smoke cigarettes?

321
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,250
No,
it's not.

322
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,230
It's not the same thing.
It's not even close.

323
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,800
Not even close.
There's no evidence that marijuana smoke

324
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,970
causes cancer.
You can't.

325
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,670
Do is get respiratory irritation.
You can get.

326
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,300
It can fuck with your voice.
What about Tara?

327
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,770
You can avoid all that stuff is what I 
was going to say with the vaporizer 

328
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:55,770
vaporizers,
the way to go,

329
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,550
but it is a different high.
Oddly enough,

330
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,470
vaporizer seems like a little bit more 
clean in some weird way,

331
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:05,170
like when I get high with a vaporizer,
I'm always like,

332
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,240
whoa,
this is like a.

333
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,690
it's almost as if this is gonna sound so
crazy.

334
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,560
There's something that's something that 
has to do with the fire interacting with

335
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:22,321
the plant that connects you to nature.
There's something about a lit joint this

336
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,480
to take it in and you just feel natural.
When I vaporized,

337
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:32,140
I feel alien when I vaporize,
I feel like this.

338
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,290
What this is is like let's extract all 
of what it is to be a living thing and 

339
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,060
get to the molecules.
What's the molecule?

340
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,270
What temperature to heat those bitches 
up or I can shove them right in your 

341
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:45,270
bloodstream.
That's what the vapor.

342
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,000
I proceeded to vaporize,
hang on hand up like whoa.

343
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,310
Like it's just.
You're not connected the same way.

344
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,960
It's connected a different way.
It's both.

345
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,960
They're both amazing.
Judgment will probably agree.

346
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,280
I agree with you.
Most people do.

347
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:59,390
I think there'll be like,
yeah,

348
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:03,350
I know even a joint.
I don't roll joints because I'm lazy,

349
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,990
but whenever someone has a joint and 
they put it,

350
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:06,820
I go,
this is when I.

351
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,080
This just happened.
So yeah,

352
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,850
I get,
I get a little higher.

353
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,780
I like to smoke joints.
They,

354
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,550
it's feels like it's real clear what's 
happening.

355
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,500
You know,
like there's a lot of these vape pens.

356
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,010
You got to press five times then hold 
them and you're sucking it in.

357
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,050
You don't know what's in that oil man 
who's making that stuff and they get 

358
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,820
yelled at and yell at you when you can't
do it.

359
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:29,830
Just press it twice,
right?

360
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,520
It doesn't work with the press it twice.
I got one more thing.

361
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,460
Do you ever fuck around with spray jumbo
spray?

362
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,430
You ever fuck around with jumbo?
Do you know what John?

363
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,830
He put it in the water.
No.

364
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,870
Super Organic.
Really high end edibles and spray.

365
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,490
And this fucking spray will put you on 
the moon.

366
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,810
Wow.
Do you have any?

367
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,640
Of course.
Wow.

368
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:53,480
But I have to drive.

369
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,430
I have some,
some of hanging with me today,

370
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,080
John Bryan Wagner is a shout out.
Like if this is this,

371
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:04,210
this is a thousand milligram,
like if you drank the whole bottle,

372
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:06,320
it's a thousand milligrams.
That's too much to have.

373
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,490
I wouldn't have a half of spray 
anything.

374
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,400
I'm safe to do it right now.
It's always fun to experiment spread.

375
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,820
Especially because you're saying to do 
it.

376
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,530
You know why?
You know why it's more comfortable?

377
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,010
Because if something happens to me and I
can't blame me,

378
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,940
blame.
Let's,

379
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,280
let's do.
Let's,

380
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,090
let's to do it now.
I'm like the worst crack dealer.

381
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:31,091
However you can do it now.
Everybody wants to do taste and then I 

382
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:35,570
want to.
I do have a question.

383
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:36,830
You know,
you might have an answer.

384
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,570
What did you have a half a spray one 
spray good enough.

385
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,410
Okay.
Right.

386
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,100
We're in.

387
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,680
What was the other question you think?
Why am I asking you this?

388
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:51,290
But I think you might've been answered 
so,

389
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,490
but I'm being totally honest.
I'm exhausted from dealing with like I,

390
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,420
it's not like it's a big deal,
but it's like the first time you,

391
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,490
whether you could admit major things in 
your life.

392
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:01,850
Like,
Oh,

393
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:04,070
I have a drinking problem.
Can Be stupid little things.

394
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:09,071
Yeah,
mine is eating like I'm exhausted from 

395
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,030
doing it the wrong way and everything 
comes back to me for self control.

396
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,030
So when people want to tell me about a 
diet,

397
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,500
I know it's not portions.
I know what portions are.

398
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,530
I just want to eat more so it's all down
to how do I fucking get self control.

399
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,930
I have zero.
I mean if I'm not going to call it zero 

400
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,241
self control,
then I don't know what the hell I'm 

401
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:28,241
going to call it.

402
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:28,880
But as you heard about it for me,
you're hard on yourself.

403
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,000
I think you have selfcontrol todd think 
you're a wonderful man,

404
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,160
but you're.
You're hilarious.

405
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,760
And one of the reasons why you're 
hilarious because you're so.

406
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,010
You're free,
you're impulsive and that sort of that.

407
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,300
It's very difficult for that to lend 
itself to dietary discipline.

408
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:45,920
It's like when I eat it,
fuck it.

409
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,080
Fucking need it.
Right?

410
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:53,081
That's you.
But that's also part of what makes you 

411
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:55,041
such a hilarious comic.
It's like you have these impulses that 

412
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,870
makes me feel better.
You don't want to comfort,

413
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,920
at least with what you're saying,
you don't want discomfort and you want 

414
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:01,920
to have fun and it's like it's right 
there.

415
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,840
They want to,
I want to eat that food.

416
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,870
Fuck it.
Just the thought of me like picture me 

417
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,931
at the,
at the cancer shoving cheesecake human 

418
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:11,931
in my mouth and my friends are like 
looking at me like todd and I go,

419
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,010
Joe Rogan said that because I'm 
creative,

420
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,980
I should eat whatever I want.
He said,

421
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,020
go listen to his podcast.
He said,

422
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,840
I shitty.
He told Joe Rogen and you can go listen.

423
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,870
He said,
clear up the mini bar before you get in 

424
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,520
your hotel bed,
even if you're not really hungry.

425
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,700
Creative.
Okay.

426
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,500
So I don't have control over this.

427
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,650
There's also a problem.
There's another problem with discipline.

428
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,600
This is a discipline.
I think that hit me already.

429
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,350
Yeah,
for sure.

430
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,760
No,
that's probably just the,

431
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,560
we'd hit you.
It takes a little while for this prayer.

432
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,280
Get usually a few more minutes than 
that.

433
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,590
Um,
I forgot my point point about,

434
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:58,570
um,
the self control.

435
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,810
Oh,
that when you really disciplined people 

436
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,110
and comedy,
they don't go well together that much 

437
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,020
either because if you're too driven and 
too disciplinary,

438
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,700
that's almost always dickie.
It'll,

439
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,800
you know what I mean?
You know what I'm saying?

440
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,440
Like you'd be able to disciplined too 
rigid,

441
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:22,441
too determined and in and to like too 
enthusiastic about success.

442
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,110
You get Dickie.
Let me ask you this.

443
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,350
You know,
and I don't.

444
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,760
This thought could be wrong,
like I'm okay with thinking something 

445
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,100
and then maybe finding out,
but whenever a comedian,

446
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,410
and I bet there's funny ones out there,
definitely because over the years I 

447
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,280
remember my can't think of which ones,
but they definitely exist.

448
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,130
They are funny,
they are funny,

449
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,750
but they've never smoked.
Drank out.

450
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,510
Can you be a good comedian if you 
haven't done those things?

451
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:52,480
I think you'd be a good comedian.
If you're a man,

452
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,640
you could be a good comedian.
If you're a woman,

453
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:57,790
you could be a good comedian if you're 
gay or trans,

454
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,010
you just,
you a good comedian.

455
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:01,950
If you're a good comedian.
Is that.

456
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,540
Why do I ask that?
Because I'm not.

457
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:08,541
I should be embarrassed to ask that 
because a lot of people that are really 

458
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:08,541
good that don't do shit,
I'll never.

459
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,340
Yeah,
they don't,

460
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,850
they don't have a desire to,
you know,

461
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:16,851
it's just everybody's brain works 
different and some people like the idea 

462
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:19,840
of losing control with a substance is 
not not fun.

463
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,670
Right.
They don't like that feeling,

464
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,610
but they can keep their shit together,
you know?

465
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:29,611
I know a lot of people that don't drink,
they don't do anything but they keep 

466
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:30,910
their shit together and maybe that's 
better for them.

467
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,680
They feel like it is.
I don't know.

468
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,860
I,
I,

469
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,100
as I asked that you gave me the answer 
that you know to go.

470
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:39,850
You're right.
You're right.

471
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,650
But like I asked it means that I had 
questioned about that and I,

472
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,840
and I think I've talked about this in 
the past and once I was like somebody 

473
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:48,840
was saying,
well he may be,

474
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,950
what if you're not experimental?
But no,

475
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:54,640
there's a billion ways to,
to do those things.

476
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,500
You used pot to do without the pod.
I think.

477
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,950
Edit that out.
I use yoga for that too,

478
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:02,860
man.
I love going to a hot yoga class fucking

479
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:07,120
hard and it's like a drug like you get a
lot of thinking done in there,

480
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,430
man,
when you're just holding these poses and

481
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,350
there's no no music,
no nothing.

482
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:13,960
Just everybody in the class.
Breathing is a 90 minute class.

483
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,200
There's some sort of psychedelic effect.

484
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,200
There is some sort of cleansing of the 
mind and I think that's one of the 

485
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,071
things that we overlook when it comes to
mental health that your brain needs to 

486
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:29,491
be cleaned out.
You can't just stagnate and think on 

487
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:31,390
thoughts.
You bring these to your physical body,

488
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,570
can clean your brain out a little bit,
can get rid of some of the stress and 

489
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,960
tension and you can see things clear 
like those terms.

490
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,720
Stress Reduction,
tension relief.

491
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,420
What does that mean?
It means the way you fucking think,

492
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,570
okay,
you're doing something to your body that

493
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:51,571
radically alters the way you're going to
think about things and everybody's 

494
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:55,230
supposed to do it,
and one of the problems in societies 

495
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,780
that you don't do it,
but you have these instincts that are 

496
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,380
built into your body from thousands of 
years of what the.

497
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,100
You know the what people ask of their 
bodies 20,

498
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:06,580
30 generations ago were all those same 
people.

499
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,730
So if we don't deal with what our body,
just some physical activity getting,

500
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,470
he's got to get the blood flowing.
If you don't,

501
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,410
your whole,
you're like,

502
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,400
you're like an overflowing battery or 
something.

503
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,640
I as far as the stopping thing think I 
have a great idea for people to do to 

504
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:26,590
get a smidget of what it's like to stop.
If you go,

505
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:28,090
okay,
I won't meditate or I won't do this.

506
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:28,900
I get it,
I get it,

507
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,760
but this,
if you do it,

508
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:32,680
I promise whoever does it,
that's listening will go.

509
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,920
You'll get a little taste of it and it 
all happens naturally,

510
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,860
but it started by accident,
but then we started realizing it's about

511
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:43,861
stopping.
So like one night it was about probably 

512
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:44,320
10 years ago after dinner or before 
dinner,

513
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,630
I had some hot wash cloths and I was 
like,

514
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:51,631
oh,
just I get a Chinese restaurant joking 

515
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:51,631
around,
but we all did it.

516
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:52,040
And then we realized,
wow,

517
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:56,620
that really stopped us.
The heat putting it on your face.

518
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,440
So now I make it.
I have a ritual that I do.

519
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,220
I have it all figured out.
I get the less people the better because

520
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:05,470
the hot wash cloth has a short shelf 
life.

521
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,460
It has to be so scorching hot when you 
hand that to people.

522
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,080
So by the time they get it to their 
face,

523
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:13,000
you know he can't take warm.
So I use the tea kettle,

524
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,200
pour it all over,
like six of them.

525
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,140
And here's the rule.
The radio goes off.

526
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:22,141
Sometimes you think I'll leave it on.
I don't feel like walking over and 

527
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:22,141
turning off.
Nope.

528
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:22,540
Even if it's jazz off and I ask 
everybody,

529
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,390
check the pulse of the room.
If everyone,

530
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,580
if you take yours off and you're ready 
to start talking,

531
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,000
but you see,
oh,

532
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:32,110
three people still have it on their face
and I go,

533
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,660
I'll break it,
but just once the.

534
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,830
Once you get the hot wash cloth in your 
hands,

535
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,910
I go,
it's going to be hot.

536
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,710
You're going to want to go.
I would taught it's way too hot.

537
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,810
It's hotter than you think it is,
so just get ready.

538
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,800
I give everybody one.
They put it on their face.

539
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,010
No one

540
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,570
even has to tell them to take a deep 
breath.

541
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,520
You naturally do after like a second 
because you need to see though.

542
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,190
Then you let it out and then I go,
wow,

543
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,250
and then you literally spiritually,
you shut down and then you wipe your 

544
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,250
hands.
Literally take some of the dirt off your

545
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,740
answer in the day and we always think,
Holy Shit.

546
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,900
Resetting yourself.
That's a simple way to get a taste of an

547
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,890
a.
We always make the joke,

548
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:10,400
we're like,
oh,

549
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:15,401
well,
we're just going to eat and then we're 

550
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:15,401
going to go on throughout the whole day 
and then put our food.

551
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:15,401
Okay,
blah,

552
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:15,410
blah.
Of course,

553
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:18,950
stop,
you got us and that hot wash cloth.

554
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:20,090
It's like,
fuck.

555
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,980
Yeah.
I think your brain has requirements for 

556
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:25,980
those things.
Those kind of things.

557
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,471
I think those,
those kind of moments are really good 

558
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:29,471
for your.
Just good for your outlook.

559
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:33,980
A reset.
I think that's like the same field than 

560
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:33,980
a,
uh,

561
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,941
maybe a primitive man would get when he 
would like walk up to the edge of a 

562
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:41,201
cliff and see like some crazy view and 
see nature and birds flying around the 

563
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:42,560
sun.
This was,

564
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,170
you know,
hey,

565
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:45,100
you know,
this is a.

566
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,110
yeah,
I'm getting chased by leopards every 

567
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,110
day.
But look,

568
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,930
this is fucking amazing.
Like a renewed enthusiasm about life,

569
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,540
about life itself.
And the simplest things.

570
00:24:56,541 --> 00:25:01,541
Obviously I have a theory.
I don't give myself any credit when I 

571
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:01,541
have these talks when things are going 
well,

572
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,660
like it's good.
It helps you know,

573
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:07,670
like,
but if I can be in a tense moment and 

574
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,241
get out of it where I would have been,
I give them that I'll be proud of 

575
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:10,241
myself.
Yeah.

576
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,320
That's the thing about all that 
motivational speaking stuff,

577
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:17,321
right?
Like it's like the guy who's doing all 

578
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:20,861
the motivational speaking,
if he's pulling up in a Rolls Royce and 

579
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:20,861
he lives in a big mansion,
so like,

580
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:22,100
yeah,
you're enthusiastic.

581
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,390
Look,
everything's going great.

582
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,290
How are you?
If someone takes all this stuff away 

583
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:29,600
then and it becomes like,
can you,

584
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,720
can you be stoic?
Can you be at peace when you're broke 

585
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,240
and you're by yourself and some one 
bedroom apartment somewhere,

586
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,460
can you,
can you do it all over again?

587
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,890
That's the suburbs,
you know?

588
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,080
Could you imagine if someone told you 
Dane Cook was the first one ever heard 

589
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,080
talk about this.
So give him credit for that.

590
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,870
He said I would never want to try to do 
standup again.

591
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,200
I don't think I could do it like that.
It was so hard to do that.

592
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,240
I would never want to start and do it 
again.

593
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,090
Did you ever think like what it would be
like you start again?

594
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,990
Like right now you don't.
You have zero jokes.

595
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:10,991
You've never done stand up.
But somehow I know that you have this 

596
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:13,901
vague memory of the grind that it takes 
to become an actual professional.

597
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,970
I think I do it.
I think definitely,

598
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,260
definitely,
definitely,

599
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:20,840
definitely,
but death because you already know,

600
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,180
right?
You already know you could do it.

601
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,030
It'd be a totally different thing.
A question now that I think about it.

602
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:29,770
Fuck Dane Cook.
Just kidding.

603
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,490
Just kidding.
Dane,

604
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,950
they'll get upset,
but I'm saying if you.

605
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,100
If you think about it like that doesn't 
even make any sense because of course 

606
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,911
you would know that you could make it so
it'd be way easier even if you just 

607
00:26:42,911 --> 00:26:44,580
started all can't in 21 again doing 
stand up.

608
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,970
This is ridiculous.
Are you.

609
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,150
Are you 21 again or you just are.
You are.

610
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,030
You didn't have to start from scratch.
I just do it to go get younger.

611
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,340
But then once you made the decision you 
would in.

612
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:56,520
Unless you live in some bizarro world,
we're allowed to live two lives.

613
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,590
You would never even have memory,
right?

614
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,940
You'd need 21.
That's what I would.

615
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,600
You will.
All I'd have to do is just say yes,

616
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:04,440
that'd be 21.
Again,

617
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,080
this is a stupid fucking question.
Maybe yet.

618
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,570
Maybe you haven't.
Maybe he'd be like,

619
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:11,550
no,
I said this and that.

620
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,200
I don't think he thought it through.

621
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,260
You said something a minute ago and 
that's when I should wait.

622
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,740
Shit.
Was it about the food thing?

623
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,580
No,
no,

624
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:28,581
no.
What were you just talking about before 

625
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:28,581
the.
We're talking about discipline,

626
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:31,731
like hard acids and then um,
then we got to like how difficult it 

627
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:32,850
would be to start over,
do it.

628
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,520
I think anything like if you said that 
to a brain surgeon,

629
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,710
you want to start from scratch,
start from,

630
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,550
you know.
Right,

631
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:41,400
right after you graduated high school,
you want to take it from day one,

632
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:42,270
freshman year,
college.

633
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:44,250
They'd be like,
oh,

634
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,480
just get them through.
No,

635
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,040
fuck that.
Did you ever think of like,

636
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,290
I know two things I would have done like
before.

637
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,900
When did you start standup?
Eight.

638
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,250
Excuse me.
That was 21.

639
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,010
Did you,
is there a job you.

640
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:03,020
When you were in high school,
did you think you thought you knew what 

641
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,020
you wanted to do?

642
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,020
Maybe for a living?
Not really.

643
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,820
My,
my number one option was teaching 

644
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:07,820
taekwondo,
which already was doing.

645
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,940
That's what I was doing.
Mostly you were already,

646
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,840
but I didn't,
I didn't want to fight anymore and I 

647
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,380
didn't think that,
um,

648
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:22,390
uh,
didn't think that dude be like a real 

649
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,010
future in me teaching.
I didn't really like teaching everybody.

650
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,750
I only liked teaching people that were 
super enthusiastic because I was,

651
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,200
I was young at the time,
like when I first started teaching on my

652
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:32,190
own,
I was 19.

653
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,030
I was teaching at Boston University.
I had my own school.

654
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,770
You 21.
Nineteen.

655
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,010
Wow.
Yeah.

656
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,180
And in Boston and Boston.
Yeah,

657
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,960
I taught,
I taught a pass,

658
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:48,961
fail a class.
Like they can get credit for it and I 

659
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:49,470
would say all you have to do is just 
show up and you get an a,

660
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,600
just try.
I'm just trying to get an a.

661
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,600
it's has nothing to do with your 
physical performance because the idea 

662
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:56,600
that everybody's starting on the same 
page as ridiculous.

663
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,410
Some of these people have serious 
athletic backgrounds.

664
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,620
Some of these people never worked out a 
day in their life and they thought it'd 

665
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:03,620
be fun to try something new.
So the idea of like grading them against

666
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,650
each other,
I said I'll give you guys all in a.

667
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,230
and I was their age.
Are you allowed to do that as a teacher?

668
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,510
Like they were.
The worst they can do is fire.

669
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:17,511
Man,
I didn't care because it only paid like 

670
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:17,511
200 bucks a month or something.
It wasn't expensive.

671
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:20,550
Wasn't a valuable thing,
but it was a prestigious thing.

672
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,220
It's like I'm teaching at a university 
and I'm 19.

673
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Did most people get the a everybody got 
an a no show up or all the times I 

674
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,510
taught.
I taught for a couple of years.

675
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:33,270
One or two people just didn't show up.
You know,

676
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,050
you're always gonna have that one or two
people just say fuck you,

677
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,470
they fuck off.
But I just made it fun.

678
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,390
You know,
I was their age and so we just,

679
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,130
we did a lot of cool shit and kick pads 
and

680
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,370
I taught him about the Turner hip and 
stuff and you know how to get power 

681
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:47,550
things you could see them.
It's a,

682
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,600
there's something very enthusiastic 
about someone regardless of what their 

683
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,431
physical ability is.
Getting a little bit better and seeing 

684
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:56,431
it,
you know,

685
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:57,490
even if they start from nothing and then
you see just yes,

686
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:58,300
yes,
you're getting it,

687
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:00,750
you're getting it,
and then see them beam like this.

688
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:06,130
That that to me was what I was into,
what I wasn't into as people that needed

689
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:08,980
to be motivated.
They just didn't.

690
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,560
They couldn't.
They would just half ass things.

691
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,930
They weren't enthusiastic.
They were distracted.

692
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:17,590
Maybe they were talking too much,
like you could do all that stuff another

693
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,360
time,
but if you want to get good at this,

694
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:24,361
there's only one way.
You have to be really interested in 

695
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:27,811
getting good at it.
You got to be really focused on all the 

696
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:27,811
things you're doing right or wrong,

697
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:28,910
whatever.
I see a comedian like,

698
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,130
do you go back a year to a club?
You saw a comedian,

699
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:34,580
he's a newer comedian.
If he has been going up at least twice a

700
00:30:34,581 --> 00:30:38,650
week and it's 52 weeks later,
it's fun to see that type of improvement

701
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,310
and you're like,
wow.

702
00:30:40,311 --> 00:30:40,940
Like,
yeah,

703
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,090
maybe I've gone up what,
300 times since you've been here,

704
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,040
but you can tell if they haven't.

705
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,390
Do you have any friends that you knew 
when you were professional and they were

706
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,260
open?
Mike makers.

707
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,150
Oh,
you mean like they're professionals now?

708
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,890
Oh yeah.
You were a full blown professional.

709
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,950
You met them when they were an open mic 
or matter of fact.

710
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:01,060
It leads me to a little plug.
Oh,

711
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,530
it does look like you set a set me up 
for it.

712
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:09,531
But Blake Wexler is a comedian.
He's a professional comedian now and he 

713
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:13,611
met me when he was 15 or 16 at helium 
and he was wearing a conestoga shirt.

714
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,360
That's where I went to high school.
So of course you're like,

715
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:16,710
you know,
and he said he's a new comedian,

716
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:19,710
so right away went to your high school 
and he's doing standup comedy.

717
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,460
He was with his dad.
We talked and I go,

718
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,470
hey,
if you want to come back with your 

719
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:27,470
friend Saturday,
I said,

720
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:27,470
here's my number.
I'll put you on the guest list.

721
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,220
And then you know,
years year goes by.

722
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,020
I was in Philly,
I called them.

723
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:31,760
I said,
Hey Blake,

724
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,980
thanks for whatever it was.
It would be a message I was leaving.

725
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,060
Hey,
got your friends on the guest list for 

726
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,060
Thursday,
and then there's these messages.

727
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,301
Then we became good friends,
so he told me I saved every one of your 

728
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:45,240
messages about a year ago and I've had 
people say that before,

729
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:50,241
but then they go,
they got to race there when they got my 

730
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,151
computer and they lost them.
He came over about a year ago with like 

731
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:57,770
50 messages and so we put them on a CD 
and put them on itunes and it's a 12 

732
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:02,310
years of messages from Todd Glass to 
Blake Wexler.

733
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:05,710
Simple name,
but the reason I think it's really pure,

734
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,090
which is a weird way to maybe say it,
but it's just for me to him now.

735
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:16,130
There was probably three or four at the 
end where I knew they'd probably end up 

736
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,130
on there,
but I mentioned it.

737
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,260
I go now this whole thing is fucking 
ruined because I know you're making that

738
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:21,270
CD.
So now I'm aware of it,

739
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,760
but most of them I never thought they'd 
end up on a seat.

740
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,910
So it's just me talking to Blake and it 
sort of tells our friendship.

741
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,370
You see the friendship grow,
but it's there,

742
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:29,990
there,
there,

743
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,150
there are some very funny to hear them 
years later.

744
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:33,770
That's,

745
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:39,150
that's a cool.
It's a cool thing to watch someone like 

746
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,150
that become a pro.
Right.

747
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,010
And just see them when they're

748
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,540
first starting out and that first year.
So who fuck knows what's gonna happen,

749
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,340
you know,
you did.

750
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,360
You decide I want to try stand up and 
then you start going to open mic nights 

751
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,930
that first year.
Who knows what's going to happen.

752
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:54,710
I mean you might eat it a couple of 
times and I'd be like,

753
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,630
all right,
this is too painful.

754
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Fuck this.
And what other jobs that painful when 

755
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:01,660
you.
When you fuck up.

756
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,290
I know I couldn't even,
I couldn't even think about getting a 

757
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:05,290
weekend.
Like because you did the MC,

758
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,750
I was on Wednesday and then sometimes 
you would a host.

759
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,780
That was a good thing.
You've got to host the open mic night 

760
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,780
and then do Thursday best affiliate,
but getting a week.

761
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,960
And I remember once sitting around with 
my friend,

762
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,840
he goes,
do you think you'll get a weekend ever?

763
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,040
I'm like,
I don't know.

764
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,940
Like I don't know why I didn't think I'd
get a weekend.

765
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,230
I mean that was.
But that's what you think when you first

766
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,160
start now.
Right?

767
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,770
I know some door guy told me I'd get,
he goes,

768
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:29,780
you're going to get a weekend.
You know what I thought?

769
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:34,781
He doesn't know what the fuck he's 
talking about because I'm not going to 

770
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:37,661
be so stupid to figure.
Oh Tony knows I'm going to get a 

771
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:37,661
weekend.
But he probably did know he was,

772
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:39,760
he was around comedy a lot.
He probably knew something,

773
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,760
you know?
Yeah.

774
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:41,800
He's going to be.
He'll be,

775
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:42,910
he'll get a weekend,
you know,

776
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,800
I got a weekend.
All right.

777
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,160
Yeah man.
When you,

778
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,220
when you talk and when you're talking to
an open Miker,

779
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,540
it's like you're talking to someone 
who's going to make a journey that like 

780
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,331
if you had 100 open migrants,
what are the odds that they become 

781
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:01,650
professional?
They,

782
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,550
they make it to,
you know,

783
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:05,450
a working stand up.
I'm guessing.

784
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,830
I want to guess it's one out of 100.
Well,

785
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,650
it's,
when you say it that way,

786
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,000
it,
it is a bigger number,

787
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:19,001
but if you take an isolated area like 
Philadelphia or whatever city and you 

788
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:19,001
don't have any of these,
you know,

789
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,890
when you go into a town sometimes I'll 
know like some of the newer Comedians,

790
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:23,210
they,
they hang out a lot.

791
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,000
Sometimes they work at the club because 
they're new,

792
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,620
but there's like a group of them and out
of that group,

793
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:31,700
whatever city it is,
I always think somebody's going to maybe

794
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:35,960
to even maybe three different levels,
one or two at each level.

795
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,450
But there's always a hundred guys.
Right.

796
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,810
Like I started out with meeting the 
cream of the crop.

797
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,270
Well you definitely are if it's in La,
right?

798
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,580
Talking about like when you're on the 
road lately or New York or when they 

799
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,381
come in.
You mean like Bloomington has a scene 

800
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:53,381
and you think a lot of those people you 
two years later,

801
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:54,020
like wow,
look how good they're doing.

802
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:56,660
And they're in New York now and they're 
so in a small group.

803
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,170
But yeah,
on the.

804
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,310
Probably on the all the comedians in 
every city that are doing it right now.

805
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,630
I guess it's a lot lower.
Yeah.

806
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,650
If you.
If what I'm saying is from the person 

807
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,310
who makes it onstage the first time 
every week at the comedy store,

808
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:12,980
you're dealing with how many,
what do they get?

809
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,220
16 people in a night and probably more 
20 people on an open mic night because 

810
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,551
they do three minutes each.
Let's just say they get up 20 people a 

811
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:25,901
night.
How many of those people are going to 

812
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:28,520
become professionals?
It's might be one out of 100.

813
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:29,340
It might be.
Yeah,

814
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,070
and that on that because.
Yeah,

815
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:33,200
and then how many people?
Some people go up once,

816
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,130
so Mike's are crazy.
I encourage anyone,

817
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,370
if you're not

818
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,610
even into doing standup,
just to go watch an open mic night and 

819
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,160
see the mania and the madness and what 
some of it is.

820
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:51,150
Just someone who you.
You what you're seeing as potential,

821
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,370
right?
Or no potential.

822
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,040
You're seeing one of those two things.
Either you see it,

823
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,120
someone where you go,
that person is fucking never going to be

824
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:01,890
a standup comedian.
There's no way,

825
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,600
there's just no way,
you know,

826
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,670
like there's no way.
And then you're saying,

827
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:09,240
Huh,
maybe she was funny.

828
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,570
Oh yeah.
Sometimes when you say the first one 

829
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:14,570
where he would go,
no way.

830
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:14,570
It's not even.
They did a bay.

831
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,190
It's never based on.
We're basing it on something.

832
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,340
It's still a guest,
but we're basically on something pretty 

833
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,411
fair.
It's not like they're joke didn't go 

834
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:24,411
over and we're going on.
No,

835
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:27,261
it's.
Sometimes it's the vanilla illness of 

836
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:27,480
the personality might not lend itself to
be.

837
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,230
Sometimes their brains broken to.
Some people just,

838
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:36,110
their brain's not working right and they
can kind of get by and regular life kind

839
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,440
of.
But you see them like express himself.

840
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:44,441
Like I'm going to prepare something and 
bring it to the stage and then people 

841
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:47,721
go,
what in the fuck is going on in your 

842
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:47,721
head,
sir?

843
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:49,140
There's those people and you're just 
not.

844
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,750
It's not going to happen.
It may be,

845
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,780
might be perfect for music.
They might be perfect for being the 

846
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,480
front of a punk band or something.
This is,

847
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:03,290
you know,
certain people like I think it might be 

848
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,021
one out of 100,
like if you bomb on stage with a song 

849
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:07,240
has got to be pretty bad too.
Right?

850
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,980
But you have like the others obviously 
the people that have just so nobody 

851
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,120
thinks we're being babies here.
The people that have physical risks,

852
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,560
that's way worse thing,
right?

853
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,350
First responders,
police officers,

854
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,690
things along those lines.
Even in sports,

855
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:26,691
I always say I could never do it because
in a comedy show and often it happens.

856
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,911
Everybody can win in one night.
Like if you're on the road and you're 

857
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:31,911
with two other comedians or three or 
whatever,

858
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:33,180
there's so many nights where everybody 
wins.

859
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,860
But in the sports,
as you know,

860
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,230
I'm always thinking I could,
I could,

861
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,540
I can't oppress you and I'm not even 
into sports.

862
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,880
I don't give a shit about sports,
but when I watch a game,

863
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:43,950
I get a stomach ache for the other team.
I'm like,

864
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:49,010
ah,
I can't take what some of comedy is a 

865
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,010
sport.
You know why?

866
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,490
It's because like you're attacking 
things that aren't there.

867
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:56,150
Right?
Like you're going after stupid laws and 

868
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,370
dumb shit that happened and like you,
you're literally by using your words and

869
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:04,371
the way you're describing things.
Literally having a little battle with 

870
00:38:04,371 --> 00:38:05,280
something that's not even there.
I call them verbal.

871
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,080
I hope I say right.
Verbal Shit.

872
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,460
What's it?
When in prison they.

873
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:11,700
What do they do?
Shifts shifts or so?

874
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:15,580
White Shank,
shank a verbal shawntia.

875
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,090
Shift them,
shift them with your shank.

876
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,680
We'll be back.

877
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:29,070
Okay.
Sometimes when a comedian like has just 

878
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,070
a turn of phrase that would fuck it.
I always go,

879
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,810
oh,
he's shifted him with his words.

880
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,460
He just a verbal.
I think that was correct.

881
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,740
Correct.
It's fun to watch.

882
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:35,910
If

883
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,660
somebody knows how to do it.
Good.

884
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,500
That's what roast battle was all about.
Rose battles essentially a support.

885
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,040
They.
They would fucking mock each other,

886
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,160
mock each other's lives in jokes and be 
really mean.

887
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,720
You know,
in some of it was like,

888
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,880
oh Jesus.
They would talk about their looks like,

889
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,440
oh my God.
Some of them are.

890
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,560
It's painful and I.
I went and enjoyed it.

891
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:59,290
I saw it up because it's almost a parody
of a roast battle.

892
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,680
I sold at the comedy store in the little
room and it was crazy.

893
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:06,280
But when I'm watching I'm like,
I'm too sensitive.

894
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,870
I would,
it would crush me,

895
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:10,660
it would just fucking crushed me.
I don't want to know the jokes that they

896
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:13,510
would make and of course some people 
don't care,

897
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:15,490
but to watch other people.
Um,

898
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:16,780
it was,
it was,

899
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,670
it was exhilarating.
Great Joke.

900
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:19,810
Writing exercise.

901
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,770
It is unfortunately some people are 
really good at that and then.

902
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,930
But when it comes to their act,
they don't,

903
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,960
they don't explore as much.
So think about like if you're writing 

904
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,620
about someone,
like there's some people.

905
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:37,650
My point is that there's some people 
that I've seen that are really good at 

906
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:37,650
that roast battle.
I see a lot of people do it,

907
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,750
but then you see their set,
their actual standup set and like it's 

908
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:42,820
missing a spark.
Right?

909
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:47,821
There was a spark that you had when you 
were in combat with this other person 

910
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:48,310
because you knew they were going to be 
firing at us.

911
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,470
So you were firing at them and it was 
all in fun,

912
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:55,590
but it was also a chance to flex your 
comedic writing skills will then when 

913
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,970
you're on stage and it's just you,
then what?

914
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,540
What is.
Is there any.

915
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,880
Where's the juice?
Are you upset?

916
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,940
Are you excited?
Are you like,

917
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:08,941
what are you just pretending it's not a 
big deal that you're onstage with a 

918
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:12,361
microphone in front of you because 
that's a real problem too or you're 

919
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:13,540
pretending it's not weird that your 
voice is amplified,

920
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,160
motivate someone to get.
It's just a great way to say that like,

921
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,020
why are you pretending it's not?
You don't have to jump down,

922
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,270
but come on.
What's going on here?

923
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Where are you?
Why are you pretending you're not fully 

924
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,620
aware that people are standing in front 
of you,

925
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,790
hanging on your.
Every word.

926
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,870
There was a comedian like that in A.
I won't even say the city,

927
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:36,490
but they had a.
They had a roast,

928
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,770
a battle,
a roast battle.

929
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,980
The.
There were some people from the history 

930
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,140
like Napoleon and it was.
It was great.

931
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,960
That sounds awesome because it was also 
a weight.

932
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,080
That's why I said it was a writing 
sample because you know if you were 

933
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,080
writing jokes you could also make 
statements,

934
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,820
political statements and and go back and
no one gets hurt because you're making 

935
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,361
fun of Hitler,
but you still have to write great jokes 

936
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:01,150
and one guy that did it,
he was amazing.

937
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:02,800
Like what the.
And I just thought,

938
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,720
oh,
he should know that he should be writing

939
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,140
because he,
his standup is exactly what you just 

940
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,140
said.
And it wasn't.

941
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,600
It was.
But I was like,

942
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:10,980
oh,
this is.

943
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,070
I hope he knows like,
oh,

944
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:14,970
that's your strong point.
The thing is the standup,

945
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,990
like when when you're doing something 
like that,

946
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:19,720
you have a little bit more freedom.
It's more open ended,

947
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,920
but on the STANDUP,
right?

948
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:25,060
People are paying to see you and you.
You're supposed to be getting laughs.

949
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Right?
And when you're not getting laughs is 

950
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,201
this feeling of disappointment in the 
audience and when you're doing new 

951
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:32,201
stuff,
man,

952
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:34,580
this is a distinct possibility.

953
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,580
There's gonna be no fucking laughs in 
the spot where you wanted there to be 

954
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:39,580
laughs,
you know,

955
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:39,580
like,
yikes.

956
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,360
I thought that was a way,
funnier idea,

957
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,850
or maybe I just fucked up the way I said
it,

958
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:48,851
or maybe I just have to stretch it out 
and figure out where the good spots are 

959
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:49,520
and then start hacking it up and editing
it,

960
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,730
you know,
but just going to be a real problem with

961
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:53,810
bombing.
You're gonna,

962
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,310
you're gonna be have to be comfortable 
with saying dot joke.

963
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,670
That's just not that good and some 
people just aren't.

964
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,530
So they get to that spot and they go,
fuck that.

965
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,450
Let's do some tried and true,
boom,

966
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,580
let's hit them with some proven stuff.
Boom.

967
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,140
I know you got me nervous one night at 
the comedy store when you were like,

968
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:10,370
just everybody.
You were right.

969
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,480
You were like,
okay,

970
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:12,170
all new stuff.

971
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,780
Everybody knew that was.
And then I was like,

972
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:15,440
oh shit.
Oh,

973
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:20,441
because we were supposed to.
That was the show or something where I 

974
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:20,441
was like,
I was up on stage.

975
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:20,810
I'm like,
Oh shit,

976
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:23,090
maybe he's never seen this one.
This is.

977
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,070
Well we've done.
Wasn't a stand up on the spot.

978
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:26,480
So there was nick use of show,
right.

979
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,960
His new new stuff show.
The thing was that,

980
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,350
I forget what it was,
but uh,

981
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,660
that show you're supposed to only work 
on new shit.

982
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,450
You're supposed to only work.
We have like a weird rule where when you

983
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,490
sit,
when I came up with it,

984
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,560
we were like,
Eh,

985
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,840
it can't be any older than six weeks old
and he bit,

986
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:45,860
you have to self police,
but any bit older than six weeks old you

987
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:50,861
got,
you got to remember exactly because I 

988
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:50,861
wouldn't have fought that because that's
a good move.

989
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:51,500
Right?
Six weeks,

990
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,310
six weeks is like,
you got some time to.

991
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,270
You're saying it's fresh and it's.
Yeah,

992
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:57,560
it's,
it's new enough,

993
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,170
but it's also like you should have 
worked it out a little bit.

994
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,720
That's more than fair.
More than fair,

995
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:03,710
right.
It's more than fair.

996
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,130
It might even be four weeks.
Four weeks might be the real.

997
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,560
She'll pull it back a little bit back.
A little three,

998
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,140
three weeks,
maybe three with dangerous three.

999
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,020
That means you've said it five,
six times.

1000
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:20,021
What more do you want?
Sometimes there's a bit that works real 

1001
00:43:20,021 --> 00:43:20,780
good and then doesn't ever see those 
bits.

1002
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:23,690
They just die.
This one's going to be a quarterback and

1003
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:27,140
then sometimes I never know either if I 
videotape myself,

1004
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:29,090
maybe I've learned.
Do you record yourself?

1005
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:29,960
I don't.
I don't.

1006
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:34,961
And I,
and I'm so embarrassed because I know 

1007
00:43:34,961 --> 00:43:34,961
how good it is to do it.

1008
00:43:34,961 --> 00:43:37,870
I did it five or six times in my whole 
career and it was,

1009
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,270
it did so much good that would think 
that because I'm lazy,

1010
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,480
you know,
when you,

1011
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:44,930
you know what you're just saying about 
you go to a joke and it's just dead,

1012
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:45,430
which,
you know,

1013
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,480
just say I started doing this thing and 
it really helps me get out of those 

1014
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:50,480
moments.
So I'll just,

1015
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,380
I'll hit the punchline,
nothing.

1016
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,730
So whatever.
I'll go black.

1017
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:53,830
And then it was,
well,

1018
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,180
I'll make up a punchline and it was 
blue,

1019
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,550
but you know what?
Then I realized instantly,

1020
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:00,740
so here's what I just did.
Sometimes in comedy,

1021
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,780
Ladies and gentlemen,
you get to an end of a joke and it's not

1022
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:05,350
the crowds fault because you're great,
but it just doesn't land.

1023
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,340
And it's uncomfortable for them,
they feel bad for you.

1024
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,340
So what I did when I hit that period 
about 30 seconds ago,

1025
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:15,490
I just been talking nonstop ever since.
And now we're here and everybody's 

1026
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:19,361
happy.
That's perfect.

1027
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:22,450
That's a perfect for like 15 seconds.
And then they figured out.

1028
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,720
I always say,
are they going to figure I go,

1029
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:26,480
so about 15 seconds ago I hit a punch 
and it wasn't your fault.

1030
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,800
And now everybody's great.
Hey.

1031
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,600
And then the whole,
like a whole new premise,

1032
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:39,740
whole new premise launches those like,
it's like Jesus Christ,

1033
00:44:39,741 --> 00:44:43,790
it's like building a house out of your 
planting a seed and then you're watering

1034
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:48,791
the ground and then the tree comes out.
You got to wait for it to grow and then 

1035
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:49,000
cut it.
Oh,

1036
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,130
you're talking about not a whole new 
premise,

1037
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:56,690
like weird out their premises or 
premises you've never discussed before.

1038
00:44:56,691 --> 00:45:01,691
Things you never thought of before you 
go into a whole new way of thinking 

1039
00:45:01,691 --> 00:45:02,300
about stuff is so much fun,
isn't it?

1040
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,530
Fuck yeah,
it's awesome.

1041
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,980
It really is.
I still like it really is just and the,

1042
00:45:06,981 --> 00:45:08,180
and the.
And um,

1043
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,430
you know

1044
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,130
the recorder,
like on the phone,

1045
00:45:11,131 --> 00:45:16,131
that's changed.
That's because I don't like writing 

1046
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:16,131
stuff down and I can say that it's 
changed.

1047
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:18,210
Did you do,
do the text speech to text?

1048
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,610
Will you just talk into it and writes 
her notes for you?

1049
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,380
That's amazing.
Every one of my.

1050
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,130
I can just put jokes on there,
but in five I,

1051
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,580
you know the recorder.
Well that recorder man,

1052
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:28,650
that just cleaned my head up.
Yeah,

1053
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,750
recorders.
Giant to pick deal.

1054
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,900
Yeah man.
He anything where you can catch those 

1055
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:35,900
slippery thoughts.
Like,

1056
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,280
I think Neal Brennan said it best.
I think he called his notebook.

1057
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:43,281
He's like,
this is like a net where I attach ideas 

1058
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:43,281
and I was like,
Ooh,

1059
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:47,660
that is a great way of looking at it.
That is a great way of looking at it 

1060
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,900
because some ideas just go away.
Like they're so profound.

1061
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:55,250
It's so profound.
But then a couple of hours later you're 

1062
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:55,250
like,
what the fuck was I thinking?

1063
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:59,540
That always used to get me where I'd 
have this amazing idea what I thought 

1064
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,690
was an amazing idea.
And then I go,

1065
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,040
ah,
that's such a good idea.

1066
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:03,740
I'll remember it in the morning and I go
to school

1067
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,850
lately.
No,

1068
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,010
I still pull that shit.
I've never remembered it.

1069
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,540
No,
no,

1070
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,020
no.
I still pulled out.

1071
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:11,120
I go,
what are you doing if my phone,

1072
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:14,900
if I didn't have my charger now I 
finally got a court in next to the bed.

1073
00:46:14,901 --> 00:46:16,790
So I always have a cord to plug in my 
phone.

1074
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:20,060
But I'd never.
Why do I not half the time.

1075
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,760
Never.
And I still have out.

1076
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,660
No,
because that's a good idea.

1077
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,370
Never Hedberg had a job,

1078
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,030
too lazy,
too lazy to get up to get a pen to write

1079
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:32,610
something down.
So I just could fence myself.

1080
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:33,480
It wasn't that funny in the.

1081
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,400
But what's great is that that was a bit 
he did on stage and it would kill.

1082
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,250
I mean,
I,

1083
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:44,251
I didn't do it.
Well I don't remember the way you get 

1084
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:44,251
the,
you know,

1085
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:45,200
they used to.
We were thinking,

1086
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:47,250
okay,
I used to do drugs.

1087
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,260
I still do,
but I used to to.

1088
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,350
Yes.
So lastly we were saying,

1089
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,120
I used to do Mitch Hedberg.

1090
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,810
I used to do drugs,
I still do,

1091
00:46:58,811 --> 00:47:00,250
but I used to to.
I mean,

1092
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,550
I still do,
but I used to to.

1093
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,950
Okay.
I know I.

1094
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,340
let me back up for a second.
So I do Mitch Doing Rodney Dangerfield.

1095
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:07,930
Rodney,
if he did,

1096
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:08,500
Mitch,
I'll be like,

1097
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:10,570
I'll tell you the other day.
You guys are used to do drugs.

1098
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:12,070
I still do,
but I used to to,

1099
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:17,100
you know,
do any Mitch Hedberg joke is Rodney and 

1100
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,490
it's.
And it's killed twitter the other day.

1101
00:47:18,491 --> 00:47:20,020
I guess me if I wanted a banana,
you know,

1102
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:21,580
I said no,
I want a regular one later.

1103
00:47:21,581 --> 00:47:22,310
So.
All right.

1104
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,160
So I use,
I do,

1105
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,090
they use to,
I hope this goes somewhere.

1106
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,200
So I used,
I,

1107
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,750
I,
I did the uh,

1108
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,000
I used to do drugs.
I,

1109
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,990
so my friend asked me if I still do 
that.

1110
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:35,770
He,
I go,

1111
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,000
I used to do the Mitch Hedberg.
I still do drugs,

1112
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:41,710
but I used to too.
I still do,

1113
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:45,970
but I used to to do something and it's 
amazing that you kept it all together.

1114
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,150
I did for,
of,

1115
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,810
used to sense.
It makes sense,

1116
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,880
but you nailed it.
You dismounted.

1117
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,000
I shouldn't try feet flat on the ground.
So solid dismount.

1118
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,770
Lube stumble.
No,

1119
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:58,030
it was good.
Was very good.

1120
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,400
Very good.
Thank you.

1121
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,910
Mitch.
He's like,

1122
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,210
to me,
one of the more amazing comedians ever 

1123
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,731
because what he would do was a complete 
nonsequitors who would go from one non 

1124
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:12,700
sequitur to another nonsequitor nothing 
connected together other than here.

1125
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:14,620
Here's some other shit.
I thought up.

1126
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,880
You know,
here's another shit I wrote down and,

1127
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,980
and even though not through probably a 
good idea for everyone to know that does

1128
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,490
one liners,
that there still has to be an essence of

1129
00:48:24,491 --> 00:48:24,700
you.

1130
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,700
And I'm like,
even though he's jokes didn't segue 

1131
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:29,800
together like they seem you're still,
you knew who he was,

1132
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:31,810
but his jokes obviously like the,
oh,

1133
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:32,720
he had a,
you know,

1134
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,810
he definitely had there not just 
individual jokes,

1135
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:38,110
just glued it all together.
They were all so silly.

1136
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,430
Right,
exactly.

1137
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:44,431
That's the thing about.
I've always said the best way to 

1138
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:47,671
describe him,
he's like one of my favorite silly 

1139
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:47,671
comedians.
I know.

1140
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:47,671
It's funny.
A lot of people you don't hear,

1141
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:52,140
always complimentary.
Of course it's silly and that's what I 

1142
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,620
realized later after he died,
like how silly.

1143
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:54,250
He was.
Silly,

1144
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:56,290
so silly.
So that was who he was.

1145
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:57,330
Very silly.
So that,

1146
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:58,810
that's what you know about him,
you know,

1147
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,540
he was the type of comedian he would get
into his rhythm,

1148
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:06,541
like I would listen to him a lot of 
times on the way to the airport because 

1149
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:06,541
uh,
I was,

1150
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:10,601
you know,
that traffic on the way to the airport 

1151
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:10,601
is annoying.

1152
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:10,601
He just wanted to just chill out and 
giggle.

1153
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,560
So I'd put on some Mitch Hedberg I just 
be fucking giggling like,

1154
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,560
and when you're just smiling when you're
not,

1155
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,410
when he's,
you know,

1156
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,380
in between punchlines and just have a 
big smile on your face because he,

1157
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:25,660
he would put on this silly vibe and you 
would get caught up in it because it was

1158
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:30,661
really fun.
And then he had such great writing too 

1159
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:30,661
and playful.
It was,

1160
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:30,661
yeah,
yeah,

1161
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:31,540
yeah,
yeah.

1162
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,580
His Daddy,
I think in Rodney had a lot of that too.

1163
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,430
You know,
Rodney's seriously,

1164
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:42,760
seriously underrated comedian and his 
style.

1165
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,830
There was a great article about it 
recently,

1166
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:47,570
didn't we talk about this on the podcast
at Rod.

1167
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,710
There was an article that was written 
recently about Rodney,

1168
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,260
I forget who wrote it like esquire and 
one of those things,

1169
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:58,740
but they were talking about how long it 
took him to become a good comedian that 

1170
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:04,801
it wasn't until he was in his fifties,
but he figured it out and it's like 

1171
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:09,000
talking about him boiling down his act 
and talking about how many cutting all 

1172
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,171
the fat out of his act.
If you go back and listen to his early 

1173
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:15,750
performances and you could see as more 
meandering and then towards the more 

1174
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,631
standup p and I,
I realized that a few years ago and 

1175
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:20,250
you'll listen to the old ones and he 
would like,

1176
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:22,000
in other words of Joe,
could be was still rodney,

1177
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:24,160
but it would be like this is more of a,
a joke.

1178
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:25,930
A comedian will tell.
Not really one line to be like,

1179
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:26,770
you know,
like you know,

1180
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:27,860
you're old when your

1181
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,320
family tells you.
You know when your,

1182
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,070
when your family talks in front of you,
hey,

1183
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:31,750
you know,
hey,

1184
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:33,770
my pups in the garage,
we got people coming over,

1185
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:35,960
you know,
pop just sits there and drools.

1186
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,920
But that was more like a piece and I 
forgot about that.

1187
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:42,230
Rodney and then there's a lot of,
you know,

1188
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:44,750
just a short little stories but they're 
not.

1189
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:49,751
And then all of a sudden I saw him,
my board member,

1190
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:56,561
Bob Nelson Nelson opened for him and 
then I got to meet Rodney backstage 

1191
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:57,680
through Bob and you know,
it is when you think,

1192
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:59,870
you know something,
it plays with everything,

1193
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:01,340
sexism.
You think you know what it is,

1194
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:03,170
but you really don't.
There's still a lot more to learn.

1195
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,690
Of course I knew what timing was before 
I saw Rodney.

1196
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:09,080
I could tell you I was a comedian for 10
years at that point,

1197
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,360
but I know timing is.

1198
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:12,950
But then when he saw Rodney,
I went,

1199
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:15,080
oh fuck,
that's timing.

1200
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,560
It was so like I knew what it was,
but I just got a doctor in and what it 

1201
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,480
was.
I just saw it delivered like the best of

1202
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:24,890
the best of the best and it,
and I go now that I like,

1203
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:27,370
I would,
I mean it was just crazy with the,

1204
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,620
at every turn and every and then just 
just when you think,

1205
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:34,900
how can he take you anywhere in the band
kicks in and then he's like,

1206
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:40,210
you know,
doing bedding music and all this the 

1207
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:40,210
other day and my wife are shit.
And then the pump,

1208
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:44,390
they got bigger and bigger.
Then he started singing this song 

1209
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,960
because everybody's saying them.
But Rodney did it in his own way.

1210
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:46,040
He starts going,
you know,

1211
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:51,041
uh,
something about to dream that whatever 

1212
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:51,041
the song is.
And then he,

1213
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:51,380
he does about 10 seconds of it.
And then he goes,

1214
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:56,381
what the fuck am I singing for?
I'm watching him.

1215
00:51:56,691 --> 00:51:58,910
I'm going,
Oh my God,

1216
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,560
you ago,
just a band.

1217
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,700
But uh,
he goes,

1218
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,380
I know that this bad to you.
They're just a band.

1219
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:08,381
But to me a bunch of fucking idiots.
And then the band has their taught 

1220
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:11,720
because they're all musicians from that 
city.

1221
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,040
Obviously they're taught,
you know,

1222
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,790
so he goes,
no,

1223
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:16,500
don't tell you what they are.
They're not,

1224
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,580
and then they all stand up and they go,
we're fucking idiots.

1225
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:27,930
I got to see Rodney when I was 19 when I
was working as a security guard.

1226
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:33,241
A great woods.
Great Woods is a concert place in 

1227
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:33,430
Mansfield,
Massachusetts,

1228
00:52:33,431 --> 00:52:35,650
and Rodney was there in the bathrobe 
era.

1229
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,020
Did you see bathrobe?
Ron Rodney.

1230
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,660
Oh,
he went out on stage in a bathrobe naked

1231
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:46,260
with a bathrobe on the Improv.
You would show up and you're saying he 

1232
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:51,061
was doing arenas.
This place is big break thousand people.

1233
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:55,840
Isn't that great in a way that he was a 
fucking maniac.

1234
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:58,360
He was a fucking maniac.
He was amazing.

1235
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:03,390
He was so free.
He was hanging backstage and apparently 

1236
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:07,501
his cock is enormous.
His cock and balls were just hanging 

1237
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:07,501
out.
He didn't give a fuck.

1238
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:10,600
He just got this bathrobe on and he's 
got his legs crossed.

1239
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:14,680
Is fucking sack is hanging down and the 
security guards would be like,

1240
00:53:14,681 --> 00:53:16,270
what the fuck,
dude?

1241
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,060
I didn't see that.
I only saw him.

1242
00:53:19,061 --> 00:53:21,580
It's like a bigfoot sighting and I met 
him later in life,

1243
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:26,581
but to me like in 1990,
I hadn't even thought about doing stand 

1244
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:26,581
up yet.
It was such a huge fan

1245
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:28,170
of it.
He walked from,

1246
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:28,550
you know,
like,

1247
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:33,570
like you're looking down the hallway to 
where his dressing room and he walked 

1248
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:33,570
from one room to another.
It was like,

1249
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:33,570
what?
Bigfoot sighting.

1250
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:35,750
Like I always saw him for a second,
but I saw Rodney.

1251
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,030
It's like that.
It's,

1252
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,900
you know,
I said seeing Rodney was like,

1253
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:44,870
it's not like seeing the,
like you saw Paul Mccartney or you.

1254
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,290
Yeah,
you'd freak out.

1255
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,340
But seeing Rodney was like getting to 
see if you sell Fred Flintstone.

1256
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,020
You can't see Fred Flintstone.
He's a cartoon.

1257
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:58,350
Rodney is so larger than life that it 
was overwhelming.

1258
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:03,410
You weren't just going taking in someone
that was a celebrity and you see it on 

1259
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:03,630
tv,
but there he is.

1260
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,420
There he is like three feet from you and
you'd be like,

1261
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,100
fuck,
that's Rodney.

1262
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,020
What does that between his legs?
No,

1263
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:12,930
shut up.
Kind of getting covered by something.

1264
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,190
Is that real?
Yeah.

1265
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,390
Oh,
that's his boss.

1266
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,510
That's the sack or his dick or both.
He's an animal.

1267
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,360
Bob would have bombed out someone of 
great stories about like,

1268
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:26,420
and they were so specific and you knew,
Rodney said them and it was just so a 

1269
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,800
couple came up to him after their 
wedding and they go,

1270
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:29,760
uh,
do you know this one?

1271
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,200
No.
And they go,

1272
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:31,980
uh,
uh,

1273
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,750
if he could.
He was trying to gamble.

1274
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:34,770
You know,
Rodney,

1275
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,720
we just got married.
What do you think?

1276
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,410
And he goes,
oh,

1277
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,150
you're both could have done better.

1278
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:46,260
What do you think?
That's a well disguised insult.

1279
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,250
I'm telling you,
it's a beautiful joe goes.

1280
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:52,920
People won't know that it was an insult 
or they get in their car.

1281
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:55,290
Wait a second.
That means he says we're both.

1282
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,900
We're both ugly.
Cancel now.

1283
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:01,740
That's playing ping pong in their head.
Ductile both good and said,

1284
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:03,600
who is that an insult to?
That wife goes,

1285
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:06,810
it's an insult to you.
I think it's both of us.

1286
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:11,820
You Moron.
That's when you find out who the Boston 

1287
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,020
relationship is.
Joke like that.

1288
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:13,530
Why?
Who has to take it?

1289
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,570
It's me who's taking the hit.
Yeah.

1290
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:20,571
Who feels bad about this one?
Maybe you both be honest and just to 

1291
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:25,011
make or both.
Maybe a great thing when someone feels 

1292
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:28,791
like they're too good looking for the 
other person in the relationship and 

1293
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:28,980
that you could they be wrong?
Yeah.

1294
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,240
That could be wrong.

1295
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:35,270
I mean there are,
there are people that like different 

1296
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,310
things,
you know,

1297
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:39,150
there's people like different looks.
Some guys like big girls,

1298
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,530
you know,
who knows,

1299
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:45,560
people like different shit,
but if you think they don't like you as 

1300
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,900
much as you'd like them,
can I tell you what you do to prevent 

1301
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:50,900
that?
What do you do?

1302
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:52,800
I hope I'm answering.
I hope,

1303
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:55,020
um,
is that like,

1304
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:01,040
because you know,
when people tell stories will be like 

1305
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,040
and,
and everything was great.

1306
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,200
I think this is addressing what you're 
saying.

1307
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,390
Everything was great and then it just,
he or he or she,

1308
00:56:04,391 --> 00:56:05,760
he or she or she,
whatever the relationship is,

1309
00:56:05,761 --> 00:56:06,960
somebody else goes and they wanted to 
end that.

1310
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:10,410
Everything was great lip look because 
what do you want them to do?

1311
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:15,411
Wait,
I'm not saying there's not rules and 

1312
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:17,720
feelings and how you present it,
but I think most of the time everything 

1313
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,540
is great and then you realized one day 
you wake up and I've had to me,

1314
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,980
I must've been on the other end of this 
and they just don't

1315
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,050
want to be in it,
but they stay in it because that doesn't

1316
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:29,440
mean they don't not care about you,
so they stay in it and it gets bad.

1317
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:33,910
You see it coming.
But so I always say I always let someone

1318
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:38,911
know.
You let them know you're not crazy that 

1319
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,050
they learn that by what you tell about 
past stories.

1320
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,930
And I once said this to someone that was
very early,

1321
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,810
early,
early on,

1322
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:48,811
but I said I have a feeling.
I practice it in my head and I was glad 

1323
00:56:48,811 --> 00:56:49,780
I did it and I was like 23 or four at 
the time.

1324
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:56,010
I said,
I have a feeling that I like you more 

1325
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:56,320
than you liked me.
And I said,

1326
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,990
I,
it's okay.

1327
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,080
I go,
let me say this because I don't want 

1328
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:04,080
this to be the day where I threw you 
off.

1329
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:04,360
If I'm wrong,
I really like you,

1330
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:05,650
so if you're,
if I just read it wrong,

1331
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:06,070
that's great.

1332
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:06,540
But,
but,

1333
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,860
but,
but that's the.

1334
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,070
I don't think that's it.
I go,

1335
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,810
I won't.
Of course I'll be sad,

1336
00:57:10,811 --> 00:57:12,610
but I won't hate you.
I won't be.

1337
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,940
I'll be okay.
So then,

1338
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,970
and then he was like,
you're right.

1339
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,660
And because I set it in a way that I 
could,

1340
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,700
that he would be comfortable to say,
you know what,

1341
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,750
if I put a little bit of choke,
a little bit of swell,

1342
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,910
but I was okay and I,
and I want to know that.

1343
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:33,970
So that's my question to be delusion.
I don't want to be delusional.

1344
00:57:33,971 --> 00:57:38,971
I felt it and I asked and I asked the 
pack that the fact that I put that 

1345
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:38,971
preface in there,
look,

1346
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:40,930
I need to let you know this is not to 
make you feel bad,

1347
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,790
but I do like you because I don't want 
to find out.

1348
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,950
Ten years later I thought you were 
giving me walking papers.

1349
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,910
So I had to be clear with my feelings,
but mainly let that person know.

1350
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,480
And that way I didn't end up in a 
relationship for another year where I 

1351
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,180
knew the other person might.
How could that go bad what I did?

1352
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,350
There's no way that could go bad.

1353
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:01,390
No,
especially if you're hanging out with 

1354
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:01,390
adults.
Right?

1355
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:01,390
You know,
when I was a kid,

1356
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:05,950
I think one of the things it took me a 
long time to get past was it was always 

1357
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:09,260
thought that if you talked about your 
feelings and your emotions,

1358
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,690
that was weak.
That was a weakness.

1359
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:16,840
It's not something you did with your 
friends and it's not something you 

1360
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:16,840
wanted to do with a girl.
You didn't,

1361
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,250
you just,
you didn't want to talk about your 

1362
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,021
emotions.
You didn't want to talk about how you 

1363
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:23,360
actually felt about things.
You wanted to play it stoic.

1364
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,460
You want to Charles Bronson your way 
through life.

1365
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,650
You know,
that's a lot of guys tried to do.

1366
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:32,490
And um,
that not understand like we don't the,

1367
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:37,650
one of the big problems with people 
because you don't really know who you 

1368
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,590
like until you're around them for a 
while.

1369
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,660
You really don't.
And then sometimes you're like,

1370
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,820
oh,
I'm not into this person.

1371
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,460
This is the.
I'm so bored.

1372
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,380
I can't have any more of these 
conversations.

1373
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,060
I can't do this.
I can't do it.

1374
00:58:50,061 --> 00:58:52,220
I'm panicking.
I got to get out and then.

1375
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,010
But everything was perfect.
Everything was going amazing.

1376
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:55,340
No,
no,

1377
00:58:55,341 --> 00:58:55,880
no,
no.

1378
00:58:55,881 --> 00:58:57,560
You thought everything was going 
amazing.

1379
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,860
It doesn't mean everything was going 
amazing means you didn't even check in.

1380
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:03,590
Right or the other way.

1381
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:09,830
But no,
that makes be bored as fuck with dudes 

1382
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:09,830
where it's the same thing.
That's why we say that like,

1383
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,790
I'm,
I'm comfortable having the only reason I

1384
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:16,791
get nervous having relationship 
discussions when somebody's going to 

1385
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:18,270
heavy on women are crazy.
I'm like,

1386
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:22,190
that was any truth to that.
You look at same sex couples if,

1387
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,480
if,
if it was traded by.

1388
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:24,950
There's a lot of women.
I think men are crazy.

1389
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,140
If that was true,
if there's any truth to that.

1390
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:32,141
It's people.
There's people that are evolved and 

1391
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:32,141
there's people that are,
you know,

1392
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:32,990
have a deep level head on their 
shoulders.

1393
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,750
Because if there was any truth,
that one section was crazier.

1394
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,890
There's a science to disproving that.
Then in lesbian relationships that you'd

1395
00:59:39,891 --> 00:59:40,190
go,
hey,

1396
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:41,570
how's your relationship?
And they'd go,

1397
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:46,660
well,
of course we argue a teeny bit here and 

1398
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:46,660
there,
but no,

1399
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:46,660
no,
we're both women.

1400
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,841
So we're getting along great now.
What we got rid of the problem and in 

1401
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:51,110
Male male relationships,
the same problems.

1402
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:52,070
It's not like you go,
oh yeah,

1403
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:57,071
we don't have the crazy women.
So when it's two guys date and 

1404
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:57,071
everything is great.
No same exact problem.

1405
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:58,730
So it's not the sex,
it's people.

1406
00:59:59,120 --> 00:59:59,540
Does that make you,

1407
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,960
you're a hundred percent correct.
You could not be more correct.

1408
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,830
And there's a real problem.
We got a really avoid this shit.

1409
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,820
There's people that'll say things like,
you know,

1410
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:14,830
women are all dumb,
bitches are men are all p Shit and that 

1411
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:15,260
that's nonsense.
This,

1412
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,500
these gender based generalizations are 
so stupid.

1413
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,980
There's nice people that are women.
There's nice people that are men.

1414
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,260
It's just,
there's plenty of them.

1415
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:29,710
You can't have a few bad relationships 
and turn on other people and every 

1416
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:34,181
person has the same gender and also like
take a good look at yourself because if 

1417
01:00:34,181 --> 01:00:35,210
you really,
you know,

1418
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:40,211
there's,
there's some people out there that do 

1419
01:00:40,211 --> 01:00:40,211
generalize like that,
like look at who look at your shit,

1420
01:00:40,211 --> 01:00:42,740
thinking that you're just diarrhea 
spraying out into the world.

1421
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,360
You know?
I mean,

1422
01:00:44,361 --> 01:00:49,361
that's really what it is.
Whether you're a sexist against women 

1423
01:00:49,361 --> 01:00:49,361
are as sexist against men.

1424
01:00:49,361 --> 01:00:51,800
You have such a piss poor way of looking
at things.

1425
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,440
Everybody knows you're wrong.
Everybody knows you're wrong.

1426
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,000
You think that,
I mean,

1427
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:57,770
whatever it is,
any generalization,

1428
01:00:57,771 --> 01:01:00,920
whether it's a racist generalization,
sexist,

1429
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:01,980
homophobic,
it's all.

1430
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:04,940
Everybody who's listening knows what it 
is.

1431
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,730
You know what it is and someone makes a 
generalization like you're not.

1432
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,350
No,
you're not looking at it,

1433
01:01:09,351 --> 01:01:14,351
right?
You don't know nice people that are 

1434
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:16,661
black.
You don't know any nice people that are 

1435
01:01:16,661 --> 01:01:16,661
black.
That's ridiculous.

1436
01:01:16,661 --> 01:01:17,060
Like,
who the fuck are you?

1437
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,670
Like,
how can you make this judgment when I've

1438
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:22,280
met so many?
Like you're not meeting enough people or

1439
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:23,450
they meet you and they go,
oh,

1440
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:26,180
this guy's a fucking asshole.
So they avoid you.

1441
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,910
So everybody's got this thing that 
they're spreading about you.

1442
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,480
Yeah.
That's why younger people tend to,

1443
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:34,640
you know,
just by being around.

1444
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:39,641
I wish there was a place you could go if
you couldn't afford college because I 

1445
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:42,371
don't think it's the education at 
college that you probably learned the 

1446
01:01:42,371 --> 01:01:42,371
most from.
It's the being forced to be around other

1447
01:01:42,371 --> 01:01:42,860
people.
You Go,

1448
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,230
oh,
I'd rather hang out with that group that

1449
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:47,870
I hated because we have the same taste 
in music and you learn it because you're

1450
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:52,871
forced to live together,
but I wish it wouldn't it be cool if 

1451
01:01:52,871 --> 01:01:52,871
there was like,
where can you go if you're like,

1452
01:01:52,871 --> 01:01:53,090
well,
I don't want afford college,

1453
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:55,160
but I want to put my kids around all.
Well,

1454
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,180
some parents wouldn't want to do it,
but kids could.

1455
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,580
I just want to be around every type of 
person,

1456
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:04,581
but you don't know to do that college.
That's the thing about college and I 

1457
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:04,680
didn't go to college.
I didn't even graduate high school,

1458
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:10,100
but it isn't that true that that's where
a lot of growing does with young kids 

1459
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:10,100
when they're fortunately or another.

1460
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,470
Some kids,
they're living with really suppressive 

1461
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,751
parents and the only way they even know 
who the fuck they are is if they could 

1462
01:02:16,751 --> 01:02:19,571
sleep in their own bed with open their 
own door with their own key going into 

1463
01:02:19,571 --> 01:02:23,171
their own room,
lie and then just be alone and be away 

1464
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:26,151
from these other fucking people that are
constantly giving you these rules that 

1465
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:31,581
you have to follow and have these lofty 
expectations for your success and like 

1466
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:36,410
fucking Christ.
You don't even know what you want to do 

1467
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:36,410
and they want you to do something that's
going to pay a lot of money.

1468
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,840
We're spending a lot of money sent you 
to sculpt todd.

1469
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,800
We want to make sure that you're 
productive,

1470
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,320
productive todd.
Don't drinking,

1471
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,230
no gallivanting in their work,
work,

1472
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:51,231
work,
and meanwhile you just finally get a 

1473
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:54,531
chance to listen to some music that you 
never heard before and hang out with 

1474
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:55,890
some people from some part of the 
country he never been.

1475
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,520
Maybe you smoke weed with them,
you hang out and you're,

1476
01:02:58,521 --> 01:02:59,490
you know,
you're 18,

1477
01:02:59,491 --> 01:03:02,520
19 years old and you're just figuring 
out the worker a lot of stuff.

1478
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,920
Yeah,
and you're free of the fucking parents.

1479
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:06,420
That's a big part of it.
Ben,

1480
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,110
free of the parents to in every 
generation,

1481
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:15,260
every generation is more aware of how 
fucking stupid the previous generation 

1482
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:19,131
was.
Like there was some grand grandpappy 

1483
01:03:19,131 --> 01:03:19,131
days back on the fucking farm when they 
would,

1484
01:03:19,131 --> 01:03:23,560
they would talk about their grandparents
and their grandparents were wiser than 

1485
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:23,560
them.
You know,

1486
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,800
that's not the case anymore.
The people today are more informed than 

1487
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,400
any human beings that have ever lived 
ever.

1488
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,110
By the way,
you have just said.

1489
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:34,730
The only thing that I agree with when it
comes to [inaudible],

1490
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:35,520
I always say,
look,

1491
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:37,320
of course there's things we should go 
back and get,

1492
01:03:37,321 --> 01:03:42,321
but mostly tomorrow's a better day,
but it goes when there's something in 

1493
01:03:42,321 --> 01:03:42,321
the past that,
oh,

1494
01:03:42,321 --> 01:03:42,321
that's struggle.
Oh,

1495
01:03:42,321 --> 01:03:43,260
we should go back to that and learn 
that.

1496
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:46,290
I'm not just saying,
but very rarely does someone get me.

1497
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:47,660
Mostly.
I always go now and I,

1498
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:50,310
I get it from another,
but that is something,

1499
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,920
but it explains everything that's going 
on right now,

1500
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:57,921
that two kids,
while I always say kids are getting 

1501
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:58,500
smarter than their parents,
you smarter and the and um,

1502
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:01,040
it makes me want to be like a,
uh,

1503
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,700
a,
a progressive bully.

1504
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:05,570
Like I try to say I called you,
I called her,

1505
01:04:05,571 --> 01:04:07,050
he said that about you on.
So mark married,

1506
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:07,830
not that word,
but I go,

1507
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:12,831
I need people that are like,
I think I might've said a bully but on 

1508
01:04:12,831 --> 01:04:12,831
the right side of history.

1509
01:04:12,831 --> 01:04:13,050
So it was a compliment.
Thank you.

1510
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,850
And what I meant is a big God.
It's like,

1511
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:15,990
yeah,
fucking,

1512
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,670
but that's what I said.
So,

1513
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:20,310
but you still,
you still,

1514
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,200
when I say it,
like as a character,

1515
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:23,410
like you still,
you know,

1516
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,840
you look,
you still,

1517
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:28,290
you have clean thoughts and you and you 
and you've changed your views on things.

1518
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,510
But when I say it like I want to be so 
mean.

1519
01:04:30,511 --> 01:04:32,730
Like I want to be so fucking mean the 
other way.

1520
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:34,800
Like I know what you mean like dice 
clay,

1521
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:37,320
but with just anybody you don't want gay
marriage,

1522
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:41,640
die already go home and die.
Why can't people live and you ain't even

1523
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,840
drop dead.
I hope your baby just the most vicious 

1524
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,490
things,
but all about people that won't like the

1525
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,200
you know all about does it mean.

1526
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:49,850
Yeah,
no,

1527
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:54,851
there's definitely some merit in that.
Just people realize how fucking stupid 

1528
01:04:54,851 --> 01:04:58,871
is because you're mocking it so 
relentlessly and everybody's cheering 

1529
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:01,541
along and then someone who might be 
entertaining those thoughts is going to 

1530
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:05,260
listen to it.
There's a guy on Sam Harris' podcast 

1531
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,710
this week waking up with Sam Harris.
His name is Christian ecoline and he 

1532
01:05:09,411 --> 01:05:14,411
used to be a white male supremacist and 
you get recruited when he was 14 years 

1533
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,550
old and was in it for like,
I think he said eight years or something

1534
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:21,551
like that and just was talking to Sam 
Harris about these horrific decisions 

1535
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:26,941
that he had made and his group that he 
had got connected to and they were 

1536
01:05:26,941 --> 01:05:30,000
committing violent crimes against black 
people and like all this crazy shit that

1537
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:35,821
he was talking about.
And then you listen to him now as this 

1538
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:38,701
guy in his forties is like super 
rational and very intelligent and well 

1539
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:39,400
read and it's like saying,
look,

1540
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:42,190
look,
I just got caught up in this ideology.

1541
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:47,190
I went down this road and other people 
were doing the thinking for me and we 

1542
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:51,451
were all doing it for each other.
It became this horrific group think that

1543
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:56,671
he got swept up in.
I think that's happening with 

1544
01:05:56,671 --> 01:05:57,640
progressive people too.
I think there's a this,

1545
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:02,850
this,
this need to be right and to shout down 

1546
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:06,580
each other and and ruthlessly mock each 
other like that has to be used.

1547
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:09,130
Like nuclear weapons,
like only in,

1548
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:13,470
in the case of severe issues were like,
you've got a country.

1549
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,770
Another country is about to develop a 
nuclear weapon.

1550
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:20,780
They're gonna go after you first or 
they've already done it and you have to 

1551
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:24,780
disarm their nukes.
Got to be nicer to each other when it 

1552
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,830
comes to talking about these ideas,
because every time someone from the left

1553
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:30,190
attacks relentlessly and ruthlessly and 
viciously,

1554
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:32,710
someone from the right because of their 
ideas.

1555
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:35,730
You just start a back and forth.
You're not,

1556
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:40,790
you're not looking at it in a way like 
there's gotta be some way to communicate

1557
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:43,030
your ideas in a friendly way.

1558
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:48,370
You know what I do now and believe me,
I'm guilty of this and I when I even 

1559
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:52,180
from when I did my netflix special to 
now the way I do for jokes or like I 

1560
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:52,180
changed it because that whole thing.
Look,

1561
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,720
todd,
do you want to take people with you?

1562
01:06:53,721 --> 01:06:57,800
Or because someone said,
I don't want to be Tucker Carlson to the

1563
01:06:57,801 --> 01:06:59,600
other side,
so flip it in.

1564
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:01,970
So fucking snarky that.
So I go,

1565
01:07:01,971 --> 01:07:03,230
okay,
that's maybe what I am.

1566
01:07:03,231 --> 01:07:05,000
I don't see it when I agree with the 
person.

1567
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,370
So if I see someone that's snarky but it
says everything,

1568
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:08,180
I agree,
but I go.

1569
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,930
So I do want to sometimes bring people.
So change the way you say go in a little

1570
01:07:11,931 --> 01:07:16,931
softer.
Maybe you're trying to bring somebody 

1571
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:18,701
with you and bring them over.
But sometimes I want to split the 

1572
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,671
difference and I could be wrong because 
sometimes I think when I'm screaming at 

1573
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:23,360
the top of my lungs and I literally have
to take a break on the podcast,

1574
01:07:23,361 --> 01:07:28,361
you know about something maybe that 
gives and it's about a transgender 

1575
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:28,520
issue,
something I'm not going through,

1576
01:07:28,521 --> 01:07:30,320
but I'm able to scream it.

1577
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,660
So someone that's going through it goes,
God damn it house,

1578
01:07:32,661 --> 01:07:37,661
he's so close.
Or when I can yell about a women's 

1579
01:07:37,661 --> 01:07:38,420
issue.
So the Goddamn it screamed at the top of

1580
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,220
my lungs because they say screaming 
about what you're not.

1581
01:07:40,221 --> 01:07:45,221
Because you can get angrier.
Maybe it gives someone their dignity 

1582
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:48,071
back.
Maybe sometimes screaming into the 

1583
01:07:48,071 --> 01:07:50,081
Canyon is okay,
but not to another person's face right 

1584
01:07:50,081 --> 01:07:51,330
into the canyon of podcasting or.
Yeah,

1585
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:51,860
yeah,
yeah.

1586
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,280
But when it comes.
But.

1587
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:56,000
But then you have to decide because the 
podcast is always a canyon.

1588
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:57,630
I think it's also you have

1589
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,700
ability so someone is going to attack 
you.

1590
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:04,701
Maybe the only way they have the 
abilities to do it in a twitter post or 

1591
01:08:04,701 --> 01:08:05,430
a blog post.
I mean,

1592
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:08,310
they're all people with their own 
opinions too,

1593
01:08:08,311 --> 01:08:09,180
right?
Yeah.

1594
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:10,020
Yeah.

1595
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,150
That's why you've got to look at things.
Yeah.

1596
01:08:12,151 --> 01:08:13,560
You always.
Yeah.

1597
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,840
That's why I said I,
you know,

1598
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,400
you then.
That's

1599
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:21,110
why I'm very aware that now trying just 
way too much stupid fighting.

1600
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:21,940
There's,
there's,

1601
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:24,560
there's debate over issues about real 
things.

1602
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:26,240
Like right now what's going on with 
this?

1603
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:28,070
What do they call it?
Walk for our lives,

1604
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:32,120
watch for our lives.
Can I go ahead real quick?

1605
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:37,121
Because I prefer I have a few times and 
there's a belief in one post I want to 

1606
01:08:37,121 --> 01:08:41,801
take down because it's a woman that 
technically me and it turned into a 

1607
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:43,370
sexist words flying back and forth and I
want to take it down.

1608
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:47,960
If I could post why I'm taking it down.
Because I think when somebody,

1609
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,320
even when your fans are defending you,
I like when someone corrects their fans.

1610
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:51,980
No,
no,

1611
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,570
that don't offend me with those words.
You know,

1612
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,080
don't.
Uh,

1613
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:57,160
so you're talking about before about 
when the verbiage is,

1614
01:08:57,161 --> 01:08:59,150
you know,
so always try to go in.

1615
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,050
I think you're responsible if you're,
if you're,

1616
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,450
if they're flying things back and forth 
and you're in a twitter war,

1617
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:05,600
if somebody's saying something,
go in and say no,

1618
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:10,601
you know the word.
You don't have to start throwing around 

1619
01:09:10,601 --> 01:09:10,601
these words has nothing even to do with 
the topic.

1620
01:09:10,601 --> 01:09:11,470
If they're just,
that's the way they express themselves.

1621
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,930
Like the way people disagree about 
things can change.

1622
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,960
Like the way they communicate,
their disagreement can change how it 

1623
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:19,960
gets resolved,
you know,

1624
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,711
and.
But what always happens is if you go 

1625
01:09:23,711 --> 01:09:23,960
hard,
they go hard pack and I think we're,

1626
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:26,150
we're dealing with that back and forth 
in this country.

1627
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,240
And what I was going to say is about 
this walk far march for our lives,

1628
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:34,690
our lives is that what I'm seeing that's
very confusing to me is from people who 

1629
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:40,781
are gun supporters,
like the NRA supporters who and some of 

1630
01:09:40,781 --> 01:09:45,191
them have even mocked these kids for 
getting attention by going to these 

1631
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:50,501
marches and stuff like that.
And they're saying that nobody would 

1632
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:50,501
have heard of you or nobody know who you
are.

1633
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:52,970
Like this is a ridiculous way to look at
it.

1634
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:54,840
They,
it's very defensive because they're,

1635
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:57,920
if they're feeling like someone's coming
after their guns,

1636
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:58,590
so they're

1637
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:03,870
going on the attack in some ways that's 
just really not recommended.

1638
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,500
Like the way they're doing their,
the bench mark.

1639
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:12,650
They're mocking what the what the reason
would be for these kids to be on tv that

1640
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:21,691
got shot at these kids that got shot at 
and they're fucking 16 years old and 

1641
01:10:23,951 --> 01:10:28,951
they're going to be on TV and someone's 
mock know would know who you were if it 

1642
01:10:29,321 --> 01:10:31,570
wasn't for this thing or.
Yeah,

1643
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,720
of course,
but they went through that fucking thing

1644
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:37,750
there.
The few kids that have gone through this

1645
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:42,751
thing and the country that are standing 
on the public stage and saying,

1646
01:10:43,721 --> 01:10:45,790
look at us.
You got to do something.

1647
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:48,700
You can't have the same shit happened 
over and over and over again,

1648
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,780
and maybe they don't have the most 
complicated solution,

1649
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:54,850
but there.
Right.

1650
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:56,200
And they're,
they're,

1651
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:01,380
they're forcing people to talk and if 
anybody should be forcing people to 

1652
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:05,761
talk.
It's the kids that were around their 

1653
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:08,431
friends that got shot,
who realized there fucking parents are 

1654
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:11,350
working all day and they come home tired
and no one's going to fix nothing.

1655
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,920
No one has the time and the patients all
in bed

1656
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:19,070
with the NRA and all these different 
organizations is if they're on the left 

1657
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,190
and everybody's beholden to their 
special interest groups,

1658
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:23,760
so these kids are seeing all this shit 
and they know nothing's gonna happen.

1659
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,100
Nothing's going to happen.
More kids are going to get shot,

1660
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:29,010
more kids are going to get shot,
and then what are the NRA people do?

1661
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:32,250
They mock these kids.
That's crazy.

1662
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,630
At what point does someone pull you 
aside and go,

1663
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:36,690
I picture,
I don't believe in violence,

1664
01:11:36,691 --> 01:11:41,691
obviously relationships,
but in the old movies when somebody 

1665
01:11:41,691 --> 01:11:44,091
would have to stop back,
that's just stops full disdain for any 

1666
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:49,701
retaliation.
He's not even trying to hit someone 

1667
01:11:49,701 --> 01:11:49,701
with.
The best part is,

1668
01:11:49,701 --> 01:11:49,950
you know,
you hit some with the back of your hand.

1669
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:52,410
The back of your hand is generally more 
sensitive.

1670
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,710
It's like it hurts.
I'll give you hit someone in the back of

1671
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:55,920
your hand.

1672
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,920
You can hurt your hand like I know a lot
of guys have broken their hands in a 

1673
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:04,101
fight because they hit someone with a 
spinning back fist with the back of 

1674
01:12:04,101 --> 01:12:04,110
their hand.
It's not protected.

1675
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,790
So that's just letting somebody know.
I'm so excited.

1676
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:13,220
Have you?
We're just saying how to be more 

1677
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:13,220
peaceful.
I'm,

1678
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,220
I'm.
What I'm saying is when somebody doesn't

1679
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:17,430
even mean we're not,
I'm not saying don't have a conversation

1680
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:18,980
and don't disagree.
Of course I'm not.

1681
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:22,800
We're saying the person that wants to 
shake you and stop you is once you start

1682
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:25,530
making fun of these kids,
someone even that agrees with you,

1683
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:28,260
that there shouldn't be any.
Isn't there someone on that side,

1684
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,510
they can go stop.
And I guess there are,

1685
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,820
but when,
when they say,

1686
01:12:32,821 --> 01:12:34,560
you know,
you should learn to see rick,

1687
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:35,610
Rick,
uh,

1688
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,240
Rick,
uh,

1689
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:36,870
what's his name?

1690
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,570
Rick.
I'm the guy who said if they,

1691
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:44,571
the kid should,
instead of looking for someone else to 

1692
01:12:44,571 --> 01:12:44,940
solve their problems,
they should learn cpr.

1693
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:46,500
Rick Santorum.
Yeah.

1694
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:50,190
That makes you not like,
that doesn't even make sense.

1695
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:52,470
You actually said that doesn't make 
sense.

1696
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,110
Doctors were tweeting it brilliantly,
like you know,

1697
01:12:55,111 --> 01:12:58,080
like that's like,
so you're saying John Lennon,

1698
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,900
would that be alive if you'll go a new 
cpr,

1699
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:02,000
is that what you're saying?
Right.

1700
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:07,020
You just gotta use CPR to repair that,
blown out liver and they explained that 

1701
01:13:07,411 --> 01:13:10,260
to him,
but then he talked about combating kids.

1702
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:15,300
I thought that was a great way.
Just some really clean tweets from 

1703
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:15,480
doctors breaking it down very cleanly.
This would not.

1704
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,030
Doesn't make any sense to them as a 
Republican.

1705
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,750
So there you go.
So what if I could just stop?

1706
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:24,990
One thing I really feel like is really 
important to this.

1707
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:30,380
I think both the people on the right and
the people on the left have way more in 

1708
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:34,011
common than they think they have a part 
and I think that a lot of the battle 

1709
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:37,470
that people in the left habits just 
they've chosen to be on the left,

1710
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,810
the same people in the right.
They've chosen to be on the right.

1711
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:43,080
So anything that happens on the left,
they completely disagree with.

1712
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,000
They.
They immediately go,

1713
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:47,190
oh,
that's a left wing liberal idea.

1714
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:52,460
And they just have these little back and
forth with each other that are 

1715
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:55,140
completely unnecessary.
I think the majority of people just want

1716
01:13:55,141 --> 01:13:57,690
everybody to get along and not have 
crime.

1717
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,700
You think Bernie Sanders maybe could 
have done that.

1718
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:05,060
Not good to have one,
but what would have happened if he got 

1719
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:06,630
the problem with Bernie is the same 
reason why he let those black lives.

1720
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:08,910
People take his mic and start screaming 
into the thing like,

1721
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,980
hey buddy can't do that.
You're running for fucking

1722
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,980
president.
You're showing right here that people 

1723
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,021
could just storm the stage.
Take the microphone from you like you 

1724
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:22,081
should say,
I would love to have a dialogue with 

1725
01:14:22,081 --> 01:14:22,090
you.
Let's do it publicly.

1726
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,490
Let's schedule it now.
We'll come back.

1727
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:29,020
We'll get a large group of people and 
I'll speak with you on this stage if you

1728
01:14:29,021 --> 01:14:31,810
represent this very important political 
movement,

1729
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:36,930
but here's what you can't do.
You can't disrespect this campaign 

1730
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,841
speech because you are literally 
stopping people from ever voting for me 

1731
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:40,480
if I let you do it,
because that's the fact.

1732
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,220
What if he watched him do that and then 
go,

1733
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:44,950
you can't let kids just take over your 
show.

1734
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:50,220
You can.
You're the guy who's supposed to be 

1735
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:50,220
running the country.
You can't even run this fucking thing.

1736
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:55,260
You've got this one thing.
You're standing on a stage in front of 

1737
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:55,260
300 people.

1738
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,170
Three of them just took your mic.
Congratulations.

1739
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,890
You don't have leadership ability,
but what about other than that?

1740
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,200
That's a big part.
That's big.

1741
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,420
That's not good,
that's not good,

1742
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:07,480
but you know what?
In the moment he made an error.

1743
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:12,540
That doesn't mean that's who he is.
He's part of the problem is when people 

1744
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:13,900
are judging you by these moments that 
you have,

1745
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:15,910
right,
and it doesn't define him.

1746
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,350
He might've done that and go,
well,

1747
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,550
yeah,
I was just trying to be nice.

1748
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:21,070
I didn't expect that.
I thought security was going to get them

1749
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:22,620
out of there,
but they didn't get.

1750
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:23,260
No,
they didn't.

1751
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:28,310
Well,
they wound up on the stage with them 

1752
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,310
screaming.

1753
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,930
I thought maybe he.
I didn't see him when he did those types

1754
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:29,810
of things.
A few times.

1755
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:32,020
See the video,
want to see it is kind of interesting.

1756
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,940
I thought it was his way of saying,
look,

1757
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,670
I get it.
What it must feel like to not be able to

1758
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:39,850
be heard and it's not my fault that no 
one's ever listened to you so far,

1759
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:44,970
but what do we have to do?
And then maybe he feels they go up and 

1760
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,900
they just a sane person would lead.
It would leave the same person.

1761
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:49,270
When you ignore that long,
they just grab a mic and maybe he goes,

1762
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:52,120
I have to be a part of letting this 
person spill out.

1763
01:15:52,121 --> 01:15:52,450
A little

1764
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:56,380
problem is then who doesn't spill out?
Everybody can spill out.

1765
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,510
Everybody can jump up for their own 
cause,

1766
01:15:58,511 --> 01:16:01,840
whether it's white power or fucking Jews
lives matter,

1767
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:07,080
whatever it is.
You could just decide you have a group 

1768
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:07,120
now and your group may very well be 
valid,

1769
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:12,330
but you can just decide now you're just 
going to yell out when whenever there's 

1770
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:15,571
some sort of a political speech and then
it'll be your chance to talk and just 

1771
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:15,571
going to take the mic and make it all 
about you.

1772
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,290
Yeah,
there's got to be.

1773
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,940
There are a lot of things we need to be 
concerned with.

1774
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,240
We need to be concerned with war we need
do we need to be concerned with poverty,

1775
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,250
education,
healthcare,

1776
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:27,280
all these different things,
but you can't just represent each one of

1777
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:32,281
these very,
very important groups and jump on stage 

1778
01:16:32,281 --> 01:16:32,281
everywhere and start yelling.
Do you know what I thought?

1779
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:33,490
Does that make sense?
Yes,

1780
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:39,790
I should be.
I should be just done with you.

1781
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:40,890
No,
no.

1782
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,420
Why?
It's because this subject is.

1783
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,610
It gets so exhausting.
I know.

1784
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:48,100
Let me add one more thing.
No,

1785
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,320
because I,
by the way,

1786
01:16:49,321 --> 01:16:51,150
you know,
you have these theories in your head and

1787
01:16:51,151 --> 01:16:55,170
then sometimes somebody will respond and
and blow it out,

1788
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,430
you know,
just on your omega.

1789
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,680
I never thought about that,
but I had this theory.

1790
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,450
It was a weird way that I thought about 
it.

1791
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:03,180
Well two things.
One kids do.

1792
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,040
I'm stealing from the act that teeny 
bit,

1793
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:08,580
but just because it's a stat I use in 
the kids do.

1794
01:17:08,581 --> 01:17:12,050
If there was yelp review,
young adults have an amazing yelp review

1795
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:13,970
for being on the right side.
Who they,

1796
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,290
who they root for,
who they are.

1797
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:16,220
I think music

1798
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:20,980
dealing with some left wing democratic 
out here.

1799
01:17:20,981 --> 01:17:25,981
Kids like what?
Do you ever talked to some kids from 

1800
01:17:25,981 --> 01:17:25,981
Alabama,

1801
01:17:25,981 --> 01:17:26,690
but I'm talking about on the masses of 
kids that,

1802
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,040
that March.
Oh,

1803
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:30,440
the ones that are ones that march the 
ones that get involved.

1804
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:31,840
If you go back and look at like,
you know,

1805
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,320
Kent State or you know,
I'm sorry.

1806
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,560
I'm sure we could.
We can pull up 50.

1807
01:17:36,561 --> 01:17:41,561
But so with that said,
now I'm not saying we shouldn't doubt 

1808
01:17:41,561 --> 01:17:44,831
them.
If I had a gun to my head and someone 

1809
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:48,221
said if we had a crystal ball,
are they making the right choice about 

1810
01:17:48,221 --> 01:17:49,040
Bernie Sanders?
These kids.

1811
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:49,850
And I go,
Oh,

1812
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,520
let me ask you.
I got to talk about that for five.

1813
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,240
I got to watch a campaign.
I got to watch a debate.

1814
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:55,520
I can.
How's he going to handle public policy?

1815
01:17:55,521 --> 01:17:57,020
How's he going to.
I can't just ask.

1816
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:58,540
They go,
we're going to shoot you in your head.

1817
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:00,970
I go with kids overwhelmingly kids like 
him.

1818
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:06,040
Yeah,
he's got to do the right thing and I 

1819
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:06,040
think if there was a crystal ball,
here's my theory,

1820
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:10,811
but I've never said this.
I think out loud that maybe 50 years 

1821
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:12,920
from now,
just like we're learning about history,

1822
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,930
they would talk about him in the way 
that,

1823
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:16,360
you know,
this guy came into office,

1824
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:19,960
picks your kids and they're telling them
why maybe 2000,

1825
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:24,970
22 started to be these good times and 
there's talking about history and a guy 

1826
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:27,430
came in the office and he really didn't 
know anything about the.

1827
01:18:27,431 --> 01:18:29,930
The he didn't really know about was he 
was not.

1828
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,820
He didn't know about war.
He didn't know about.

1829
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,090
No and no one thought he could really do
it,

1830
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:38,100
but he was one thing that you wouldn't 
think would answer our economical 

1831
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:38,100
problems.
You can be a nice hearted person,

1832
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:40,220
but that's not going to answer your 
economical problems,

1833
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:45,310
but it ended up doing that because he,
he did truly treat everybody kind and it

1834
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,070
ended up then when people started to be 
treated fairly.

1835
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:52,310
If the world worked better with less 
depressed people,

1836
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,680
I'm not saying everybody,
but people would torture people.

1837
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:59,710
We had someone empowered.
It was overwhelmingly kind and people 

1838
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:03,410
felt the wrath that almost very quickly 
maybe we go and then you know what?

1839
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:08,680
No one ever thought this than some of 
the economical problems worked out the 

1840
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,930
work themselves out.
Now that is based on no science.

1841
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:14,330
No.
Well,

1842
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,390
yeah,
I'm acknowledging that,

1843
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,270
but that was in my head that

1844
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:24,380
the economy is apparently a very 
complicated thing that can be 

1845
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:28,750
interpreted many ways.
Like there are many people right now 

1846
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,030
that will tell you the economy has never
been better.

1847
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:31,150
Stock market's booming.
Uh,

1848
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:35,630
black people are more employed today 
than ever in history,

1849
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,970
and these are like the mega people,
right?

1850
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
They'll,
they'll jump on that and other people 

1851
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,000
will tell,
you know,

1852
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,291
we're,
we're sitting on a bunch of huge 

1853
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:46,871
bubbles,
a commercial real estate bubble and 

1854
01:19:46,871 --> 01:19:47,870
credit bubble and all this different 
shit that could go down at any moment.

1855
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:51,130
There's all sorts of problems.
We're getting automated cars soon.

1856
01:19:51,131 --> 01:19:54,080
It's going to put thousands of people 
out of jobs if not millions.

1857
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:59,520
You know?
It's hard to figure out who the fuck's 

1858
01:19:59,520 --> 01:19:59,520
right?
It's hard.

1859
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,100
It's when you talk about like a dummy 
like you or myself and trying to 

1860
01:20:03,621 --> 01:20:08,621
prognosticate like what would make 
people successful and would make people 

1861
01:20:08,621 --> 01:20:08,621
not what I.

1862
01:20:08,621 --> 01:20:13,450
I don't know about the economic part,
but what I do know is his long as you 

1863
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:18,291
have a person who's kind but also from 
like a person who's kind,

1864
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:21,450
but you also.
You're not worried about them.

1865
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,120
If something happens with China or 
Russia,

1866
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:29,300
like we live in a crazy world.
We live in a world where there's really 

1867
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:33,471
basically three superpowers but one 
motherfucker of a superpower and that's 

1868
01:20:33,811 --> 01:20:38,811
us,
but we're run by a guy who used to host 

1869
01:20:38,811 --> 01:20:39,690
celebrity apprentice.
Okay.

1870
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,960
Like it's gotten super squirrely.
It's super squirrely and there's all 

1871
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,180
these other people that are other 
superpowers that are going,

1872
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:53,720
what's going on over there?
That place don't look so fucking 

1873
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,601
healthy.
That place looks a little fucked up 

1874
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:57,480
right now and this is like they're 
expelling Russian diplomats and all this

1875
01:20:57,481 --> 01:21:02,481
crazy shit's going down and,
and potent just one another election and

1876
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:06,450
we're watching this thing go down 
between the top three superpowers in one

1877
01:21:06,451 --> 01:21:09,810
of them is one by a maniac,
maybe two of them are,

1878
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:14,900
but one of them is run by a guy who 
knows a maniac and we put them in there 

1879
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,320
and a lot of people are still going 
along with it and they like it.

1880
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:17,670
So I.
Oh,

1881
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,310
I got a question for you.
Okay.

1882
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,100
With no,
not,

1883
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:24,220
not like snarky or anything because I 
was trying to think like,

1884
01:21:24,221 --> 01:21:29,221
you know,
like there's more things you said we 

1885
01:21:29,221 --> 01:21:31,171
have in common.
Then there's got to be some 

1886
01:21:31,171 --> 01:21:31,171
commonalities.
Freedom.

1887
01:21:31,171 --> 01:21:32,740
Freedom's number one would be one that 
you could like.

1888
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:34,600
Because I always think like anything I 
could get,

1889
01:21:34,601 --> 01:21:36,580
defend trombone,
even if it's stupid.

1890
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:39,040
I go out of my way to defend it one 
time.

1891
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:40,960
Someone who,
it doesn't matter what it was.

1892
01:21:40,961 --> 01:21:42,460
There were two times and I did.
I went,

1893
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:43,420
no,
that's the.

1894
01:21:43,421 --> 01:21:48,421
He didn't do anything or what's 
something positive about trump that you 

1895
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:50,980
or what they want to build,
they want to pass or something they want

1896
01:21:50,981 --> 01:21:53,330
to do that you think I'm okay with that.
Like what?

1897
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:54,970
What are some of those things?
Are there any.

1898
01:21:55,570 --> 01:22:00,570
As far as bills,
you're like something you can be 

1899
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:02,980
positive.
Even meet in the middle and you said 

1900
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:02,980
that and

1901
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:02,980
seen anything.
That made me very excited.

1902
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:05,100
I've seen more things that made me very 
nervous.

1903
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:08,640
The offshore drilling,
that makes me very nervous.

1904
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:13,940
Obviously those things break sometimes.
We've had a few of them in our 

1905
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:14,880
lifetimes.
The Alaska one,

1906
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,460
that was a big one.
I remember that it happened right when I

1907
01:22:17,461 --> 01:22:22,461
was in high school or no,
I was right when I was starting to do 

1908
01:22:22,461 --> 01:22:25,641
standup.
That's what it was like literally right 

1909
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:27,831
around then the valve ds had crashed and
leaked all that oil into and just 

1910
01:22:27,831 --> 01:22:32,211
destroyed this delicate ecosystem with 
millions of gallons of oil or whatever 

1911
01:22:32,431 --> 01:22:37,431
it was.
How many thousands gallons or whatever 

1912
01:22:37,431 --> 01:22:37,431
the fuck it was,
but that they're gonna,

1913
01:22:37,431 --> 01:22:38,760
they're gonna have more offshore 
drilling.

1914
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
That scares the shit out of me.
They they're getting rid of certain 

1915
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,950
public parks and shrinking them and 
opening up these,

1916
01:22:46,951 --> 01:22:51,951
drilling these,
these areas for drilling and natural 

1917
01:22:51,951 --> 01:22:55,530
resources that make people very nervous.
In doing this,

1918
01:22:55,531 --> 01:23:00,531
they could be damaging rivers and that 
these delicate ecosystems where people 

1919
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:03,240
go and hike and camp through and they're
going to close these down.

1920
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:05,800
That's the real concern.
The real is that gonna

1921
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:11,010
people are gonna somehow or another 
we're gonna suffer because so that some 

1922
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:15,250
companies can profit incredibly off of 
natural land,

1923
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,530
natural resources that are on public 
land.

1924
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:22,890
That's a big fear because that's some 
shit that is really unusual about this 

1925
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:25,090
country and some some shit that Teddy 
Roosevelt saw way,

1926
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:27,520
way in advance.
He saw the benefit of doing this,

1927
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:31,150
of having these massive national parks.
Yeah,

1928
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:33,130
sure.
In in one.

1929
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:38,490
What about positive?
I was asking because you're saying that 

1930
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:39,850
that's the number one negative,
all this social stuff.

1931
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:44,851
I mean,
I feel like the most hilarious thing is 

1932
01:23:44,851 --> 01:23:47,110
that Kim Jong.
Owen actually wants to talk to him.

1933
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:48,640
It's like,
this guy is so crazy.

1934
01:23:48,641 --> 01:23:53,641
Maybe maybe I'll just talk to them.
I mean like what he wants to tell 

1935
01:23:53,641 --> 01:23:54,880
nobody.
Nobody else wanted to have meetings with

1936
01:23:54,881 --> 01:23:55,380
that guy.
Right?

1937
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,840
He's wanted to talk to a president for 
the longest time and they would talk to 

1938
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:00,840
him.

1939
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:05,020
Right?
Because they don't want to give them 

1940
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:05,020
that good photo opportunity.
At the very least.

1941
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,760
That's hilarious.
They're worried about their facebook 

1942
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:08,760
page.
Would we witness that if they talked?

1943
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:13,770
Fuck yeah.
We would witness it and trump would 

1944
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:13,770
tower over them.
It'd be so creepy.

1945
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:18,800
Trump's a big guy and you see what 
happens when you ever seen pictures of 

1946
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,381
him with desert robin.
Do you ever see pictures of Kim Johnson?

1947
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:25,780
I'm good,
dude.

1948
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,410
Kim Jong swoon is a huge basketball fan,
apparently.

1949
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:34,440
And loves Dennis Rodman.
Dennis Rodman goes to North Korea 

1950
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:34,440
parties,
right?

1951
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:34,870
Right.
Dennis Rodman,

1952
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,820
like if trump was smart.
I know trump hired Amarosa.

1953
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,170
Trump's definitely hired Dennis Rodman.
Fucking 100 percent,

1954
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:43,210
like 100 percent.
Say Dennis Rodman.

1955
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:46,630
Please would you be my emissary?
Look at that.

1956
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,800
Without big.
Dennis Rodman is as large fellow and 

1957
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,230
he's not even big compared to like a 
really big guy.

1958
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:54,700
Right?
Like Lebron.

1959
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:56,890
What if he had big,
but what's his name?

1960
01:24:56,890 --> 01:25:00,230
King a King Jong what?
Kim Jong wound.

1961
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,650
They still can't get a picture of Kim 
Jong,

1962
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:04,000
Il.
John with Dennis Rodman.

1963
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:04,940
What if you were like,
Eh,

1964
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:07,690
you think it'd be bad if you went like 
foot high platforms?

1965
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:09,040
Deadly already.
But he denied it.

1966
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,180
Yeah,
he probably would.

1967
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:13,360
And he had long pants trying to cover 
them while he's Korean.

1968
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:14,500
Well,
he's North Korean.

1969
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:19,900
Uh,
there's some Korean folks that are 

1970
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:19,900
pretty big.
Um,

1971
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:20,010
I remember,
um,

1972
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:24,550
when I was a kid,
the kid who won the heavyweight national

1973
01:25:24,551 --> 01:25:27,490
title is named Jimmy Kim.
He was a big Korean kid,

1974
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:32,200
big heavyweight kid who was really good.
Six foot five.

1975
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:37,230
So I don't know how big Kim Jong Luna's,
but I bet he looks tiny compared to 

1976
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:37,600
Dennis Rodman.
Two foot three.

1977
01:25:37,601 --> 01:25:39,430
I just looked it up on my phone.
Wow.

1978
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:41,790
That was quick.
I think,

1979
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:43,960
um,
it would be a weird meeting,

1980
01:25:43,961 --> 01:25:46,480
but it might actually be okay.
It might be good.

1981
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:52,500
This people gotta,
something's gotTa break over there like 

1982
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,171
what they're doing is just saying the 
way they keep those people essentially 

1983
01:25:55,171 --> 01:25:55,171
hostage.
There's no food.

1984
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:58,840
The people that have escaped had 
horrible fucking parasites in their body

1985
01:25:58,841 --> 01:25:59,970
and like,
see,

1986
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,650
I feel bad.
I don't know.

1987
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,010
So guys escaped and got shot at

1988
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,780
on the border.
Fascinating footage.

1989
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:07,790
You're saying they keep them hostage.
Who are you talking about?

1990
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:10,760
The people of North Korea,
they're essentially held hostage.

1991
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:13,820
I mean they're there.
They're trapped by dear leader.

1992
01:26:13,821 --> 01:26:16,520
You know what they have to do?
Like if when when the dad died,

1993
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:21,970
these people were all weeping in the 
street and they had a weep like 

1994
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:21,980
outwardly,
loudly,

1995
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:25,280
as long as they could do it,
and if you stop weeping early,

1996
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:28,670
you'd be punished.
And people who they felt weren't weeping

1997
01:26:28,671 --> 01:26:33,671
enough got six months in jail.
It's a crazy place and everyone turns on

1998
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:36,800
everyone.
Everyone,

1999
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,920
rats,
everyone else out on everything they do.

2000
01:26:39,921 --> 01:26:42,170
You're supposed to meet together.
You go in front of this,

2001
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:45,470
these people and you rat each other out 
for all the different things you do.

2002
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:49,070
Michael Mouse has a great book about it.
Is it called dear reader?

2003
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:53,240
Is that the name of his book earlier,
Dear Leader or dear reader?

2004
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:55,940
What do affiliates?
Dear reader,

2005
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:57,890
he's a funny guy,
Michael Malice,

2006
01:26:57,891 --> 01:27:02,600
but I'm feeling North Korea.
Do you ever hear something?

2007
01:27:02,601 --> 01:27:03,620
You're like,
I should know that.

2008
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:08,670
Like I should know it too.
That's one of the things about this 

2009
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:09,890
podcast is just being able to talk to it
is dear reader,

2010
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:15,970
being able to talk to people on this 
podcast and you get like a little quick 

2011
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:19,340
three hour course and what the fuck's 
going on in North Korea?

2012
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:21,500
So Michael was amazing for that.
And you know,

2013
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:25,820
who else was Henry rollins was Henry 
rollins went over there as a fucking.

2014
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:29,480
A tourist wandered around over there.
That guy is an animal.

2015
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:32,920
That guy goes everywhere and he just 
went over to uh,

2016
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:34,770
what was the,
was there a purpose?

2017
01:27:34,771 --> 01:27:38,510
Rollins just picks a spot on the map.
You should listen to his podcast.

2018
01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:41,270
He did with Ra should fear.
That's the one that really got me.

2019
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:42,470
I mean,
I changed my.

2020
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,790
The way I look at Henry,
I always,

2021
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:49,160
I always liked his music,
always liked to spoken word stuff and 

2022
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:49,160
Zach thing stuff and this is his 
attitude,

2023
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:53,920
just a no bullshit sort of a guy.
He's got a little saying that he put on 

2024
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:57,650
the back wall of one of the clubs that I
worked,

2025
01:27:57,651 --> 01:28:01,340
one of the theaters that I worked about,
the people that work there,

2026
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,550
you know the,
the,

2027
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,850
you know how you're,
you're the lucky one,

2028
01:28:04,851 --> 01:28:09,851
so you should,
you should be very thankful that these 

2029
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:10,910
people who work way harder than you make
way less money than you.

2030
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:13,130
And I'm like,
that's the guy that's like looking at it

2031
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:15,120
the right way.
So he takes us,

2032
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,620
he takes the fucking spot pointed down 
on the map and he's like,

2033
01:28:18,621 --> 01:28:23,621
okay,
let's try Bahrain and he just fucking 

2034
01:28:23,621 --> 01:28:23,621
travels to Bahrain.

2035
01:28:23,621 --> 01:28:28,280
You know,
he'll go to the middle of Africa and go 

2036
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:28,280
to Cameroon.
He just travels there.

2037
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,260
He doesn't know anybody there.
He buys water when he gets there,

2038
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:34,480
brings his fucking camera and some 
clothes and a laptop and he takes 

2039
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,840
pictures and then he writes it.
It doesn't do any shows or,

2040
01:28:35,841 --> 01:28:37,880
and he's a fucking animal dude.
He's crazy.

2041
01:28:37,881 --> 01:28:39,260
No,
she hasn't just shows anymore.

2042
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:41,990
It doesn't do shows anymore.
He does spoken word performances.

2043
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:44,360
He doesn't do any music anymore and says
I'm done.

2044
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:49,390
I don't want to do it anymore.
And just writes books and just writes a 

2045
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,811
lot of articles,
writes articles for like a bunch of 

2046
01:28:52,811 --> 01:28:55,361
different publications.
But I mean he's super prolific and I 

2047
01:28:55,361 --> 01:28:57,840
really enjoy his writing.
His writing is,

2048
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:58,820
it's,
it's like,

2049
01:28:58,821 --> 01:29:01,460
it's crisp,
it's energetic.

2050
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:01,900
It's

2051
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,870
like he writes like the way he talks and
the way he behaves,

2052
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:10,160
like he appreciates your attention span,
you know,

2053
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:15,170
he's enthusiastic about what he's 
talking about and he's got some shit to 

2054
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:15,170
say.
Bam.

2055
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:15,340
Well,
it sounds like something I,

2056
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,400
I'm not a good reader,
but I could get it on books,

2057
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:20,040
on tape because just hearing it directly
yet because I get,

2058
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:25,041
I,
I like when someone speaks to me very 

2059
01:29:25,041 --> 01:29:27,800
specifically get lost very easily made 
to.

2060
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:30,200
Um,
what did I have to say about rollins?

2061
01:29:30,201 --> 01:29:32,370
Said he went to North Korea to.
He's an animal.

2062
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:34,440
A guy went everywhere,
but how long will he go somewhere,

2063
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:36,420
like a couple of weeks.
Whatever the fuck he wants.

2064
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,960
He's Henry rollins and he has money so 
he got to stay in a nice way to do 

2065
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:41,960
whatever you want.
There's no nice hotels.

2066
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:45,180
There's places where there is no nice 
hotels where there's no nice hold.

2067
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,160
You're not living in the lap of luxury 
in Cameroon,

2068
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:50,680
know you take what they got and you 
know,

2069
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:53,520
you just hang with the people.
It'd be like the locals,

2070
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:55,320
you know,
meet some cool people,

2071
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:57,870
hang out with them.
That's the reality.

2072
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,170
The guy was just um,
you know,

2073
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,180
feeling as travel,
oats and really got into it and now it's

2074
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:07,680
like a,
uh,

2075
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,800
it's recreated.
It's not just recreation,

2076
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:11,590
you know,
it's,

2077
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:16,630
it's a recreation,
but it's also like a life perspective 

2078
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:20,280
altering burst that you give yourself,
you know,

2079
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:24,210
you're going to Pakistan and wandering 
the streets of Karachi and Pakistan,

2080
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:24,840
like,
what,

2081
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:27,180
how did I do this?
Like,

2082
01:30:27,181 --> 01:30:29,700
this is crazy.
And then he's got to actually survive.

2083
01:30:29,701 --> 01:30:31,950
He's got to get out of those places.
Man,

2084
01:30:31,951 --> 01:30:35,040
I don't know if I could have so much ad.
I mean I know who he,

2085
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:36,630
after you go through something like 
that,

2086
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:37,950
your,
your,

2087
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:39,300
your,
your spirituality,

2088
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:41,880
your spirituality,
your va and I,

2089
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:43,890
that part I admire,
but then doing it,

2090
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:46,080
I just,
yeah,

2091
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:47,560
I'm just,
I don't want to be in like,

2092
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,950
you have to be uncomfortable and hot 
and.

2093
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,570
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2094
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,130
You get what I mean,
that'd be in trump's trouble.

2095
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,890
You for sure.
I mean he's gone everywhere,

2096
01:30:56,070 --> 01:31:00,690
but yeah,
I'll just watch the documentary.

2097
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:02,760
There's something about both of those 
places tell.

2098
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:04,020
Right?
Oh,

2099
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:06,250
of course he never came places I've 
gone.

2100
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:08,730
You have to go camping.
When was the last time?

2101
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,210
Um,
what else to maybe.

2102
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:11,490
No,
no,

2103
01:31:11,491 --> 01:31:11,750
no,
no,

2104
01:31:11,751 --> 01:31:12,000
no,
no.

2105
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,680
About a year ago.
A year ago.

2106
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:16,350
Where'd you guys go with two?
Oh,

2107
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:20,280
I shot a pilot.
Sounds so cold camping with todd.

2108
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,290
Oh really?
And we went,

2109
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:22,410
we,
we shot it up.

2110
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:25,740
It was me,
Zach Galifianakis and John Doren.

2111
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:28,140
Eddie pepitone and oh,
that sounds awesome.

2112
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,700
Close to letting it happen.
It happened,

2113
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:30,570
you know,
it's weird.

2114
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,690
We didn't end up.
We shot the pilot even a bad pilot,

2115
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,550
but that's the premise.
I really did think,

2116
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:39,000
and I don't ever think this,
but once in awhile I do have it,

2117
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:40,440
just be honest with my thought,
I'll be like,

2118
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:42,900
I think this is going to sell because 
it's just camping with todd.

2119
01:31:42,901 --> 01:31:45,210
It's like you're on fire.
People are comfortable.

2120
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:47,310
They talked to you have a musical 
performance.

2121
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:49,740
Who was playing the guitar?
That was,

2122
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:52,890
that was John Door,
but he was just being silly and um,

2123
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:57,950
as long as he's only being safe,
I will not tolerate some real live 

2124
01:31:57,950 --> 01:32:00,130
singing by a fire.
And then at the end we did.

2125
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,070
We had someone come out with like a 
trumpet and guitar and they did a real.

2126
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:05,810
So Kuumba,
Yasser public domain and um,

2127
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:11,430
and then we.
And then we tried to sell it and no one 

2128
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:11,430
was really interested.
So it's okay,

2129
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:15,590
you know,
what is that thing that people do where 

2130
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:19,021
they like hire someone who play Acoustic
Guitar and sing songs in a restaurant 

2131
01:32:19,021 --> 01:32:19,860
and they like walk over to a table.
Have you ever seen that?

2132
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,920
Oh,
like a Mariachi or not even a Mariachi.

2133
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:27,040
Just a guy with a guitar.
I was at a restaurant the other day and 

2134
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:27,040
this woman,
she had an amazing voice.

2135
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:31,080
She was saying that Dolly Parton Song,
Jolene and she just had a nowhere.

2136
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:33,760
Like I went to the bathroom,
came back,

2137
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:36,810
this lady singing a song like I didn't 
even have this happen here.

2138
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:38,740
Magicians use to do that.
Oh,

2139
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:39,880
that was the worst dude.

2140
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,070
That's the worst.
Wait,

2141
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,880
who did that?
It would interrupt conversation.

2142
01:32:42,881 --> 01:32:44,170
You'd be in the middle of a 
conversation.

2143
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:47,620
I'd like you to pick a card.
Oh Man.

2144
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,940
Come on.
I'm not interested.

2145
01:32:48,941 --> 01:32:50,710
Thank you.
But if you say thank you,

2146
01:32:50,711 --> 01:32:53,170
you're the Dick.
Like I just came here to work food.

2147
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:58,940
I don't want to do tricks.
Like even though I love closeup magic,

2148
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:02,200
I really do.
To me it's the only magic there is,

2149
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:07,500
but yeah,
if you're in the middle of a 

2150
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:07,500
conversation,
yeah,

2151
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,130
I really do feel chicken meat.
If that's the name of your place,

2152
01:33:09,131 --> 01:33:13,150
it's magic and me and everybody knows 
you get a magician.

2153
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:18,350
The magician is going to come over and 
come to the table and do his stuff in 

2154
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:18,790
front of you.
That is totally cool.

2155
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:20,380
Not Against that,
like knowing,

2156
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,440
but if you're in the middle of a 
conversation and the magician comes over

2157
01:33:23,441 --> 01:33:25,360
and all of a sudden once you pick a card
like,

2158
01:33:25,361 --> 01:33:28,360
come on man,
we have some shit we have to talk about.

2159
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:33,750
Just because we're in a public place 
doesn't mean you can join in like we're 

2160
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:33,750
supposed to be.
We're paying,

2161
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:36,580
we're paying here,
and then you can either be a magician or

2162
01:33:36,581 --> 01:33:39,280
some people would say conversation 
stopper.

2163
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:40,350
Yes.
You've got to go.

2164
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:43,210
What do you put on your card?
Yeah.

2165
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:46,330
It's not even his fault.
Is this the job?

2166
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,250
That's his job.
What is he going to do?

2167
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:50,200
Like that's what they hired him for.
Hey,

2168
01:33:50,201 --> 01:33:51,810
you want to work for us?
Sure,

2169
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:52,960
I need a job.
Okay,

2170
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:57,961
you're going to be a magician.
You're going to walk around the tables 

2171
01:33:57,961 --> 01:33:57,961
and do magic in front of people.
Okay.

2172
01:33:57,961 --> 01:33:58,490
It's not his fault.
Right?

2173
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:02,650
That's why restaurants fault.
That's why I always err on,

2174
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:05,100
even though I was interrupting the 
conversation,

2175
01:34:05,150 --> 01:34:05,980
I just,
I get it,

2176
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:10,981
so I'm pretty polite and I uh,
and try to enjoy it and it's usually 

2177
01:34:10,981 --> 01:34:10,990
pretty short.

2178
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:12,070
But yeah,
I'm always wishing,

2179
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:17,100
yeah,
we're just into this intense 

2180
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:17,100
conversation.
It depends on how high you are,

2181
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:17,100
right?
If you're high,

2182
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:19,380
you let the guy talk,
but if you had a cup of coffee,

2183
01:34:19,381 --> 01:34:20,230
you're like,
hey dude,

2184
01:34:20,231 --> 01:34:23,560
I can't live.
If you give them $500 you need.

2185
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:26,970
If you own or manage a restaurant,
you need a closeup magician.

2186
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,720
It's all capitals.
Listen to this.

2187
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:36,740
Only happened to me twice ever.
And it wasn't the worst thing in the 

2188
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:36,740
world.
It's,

2189
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:40,510
I just feel like unless it's in the name
of your restaurant,

2190
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:45,870
you probably shouldn't do that.
It's not like something that happens a 

2191
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:45,870
lot.

2192
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:50,680
I like magicians.
I love working with the comedy Magic 

2193
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:53,370
Club.
I used to back in the day before I used 

2194
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:53,370
to book my own show there.
When I would do a show,

2195
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:56,980
I would work with a magician always.
So there's always like one comic,

2196
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,680
a magician,
and then maybe one other comic.

2197
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:02,960
I think that's how they did it.
They do it a bunch of different.

2198
01:35:02,961 --> 01:35:04,550
Oh yeah.
In the most of each.

2199
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:05,300
Yeah.
That place.

2200
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:08,300
Amazing.
That place is amazing that that place is

2201
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:10,950
also like a museum comedy inside.
Well the,

2202
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,820
they have like Popeye's outfit,
but Robin Williams more.

2203
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:16,700
It's framed on the wall and those 
signatures in that long.

2204
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:19,850
In the green room.
It's a breezy.

2205
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:24,420
It is array of signatures on a wall from
the last 35 years or 40 minutes.

2206
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:25,870
Yeah,
it's crazy.

2207
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:29,930
It's a long term to be similar and he's 
such a nice guy too.

2208
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:35,740
It's um,
I think that's the second oldest comedy 

2209
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:36,860
club in the world right now.
I think the ice house was number one and

2210
01:35:36,861 --> 01:35:41,510
comedy and magic.
Just slightly younger in terms of club.

2211
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,950
And then where'd you,
where'd you go after that?

2212
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:45,950
The comedy works in Denver.
Pretty close for olders.

2213
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:50,970
The how old is economy works in Denver 
can only be like 23 years old or 

2214
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:51,020
something.
Well I thought it was a 30.

2215
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,310
Is it?
You might be right.

2216
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:53,570
Yeah,
you didn't.

2217
01:35:53,571 --> 01:35:57,830
Roseanne start there.
Maybe Roseanne started there in Detroit.

2218
01:35:58,010 --> 01:35:58,720
Uh,
the,

2219
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:00,670
uh,
it's the,

2220
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,290
his name is in the title,
but still we're in the eighties,

2221
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:05,480
right?
I mean they used to be some places.

2222
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:09,090
The ice houses from the sixties.
The icehouse started.

2223
01:36:09,091 --> 01:36:09,350
Oh,
no,

2224
01:36:09,351 --> 01:36:09,830
no,
I'm sorry.

2225
01:36:09,831 --> 01:36:12,200
I didn't mean older.
I just met with next on the list.

2226
01:36:12,201 --> 01:36:14,810
Where do you go to these places or not?

2227
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:15,980
Yeah,
but I mean there's like a,

2228
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,630
there's a few of the old,
old,

2229
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:21,500
old places that are still around those,
like historical places,

2230
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:25,610
like the comedy store is the most 
historical,

2231
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:31,040
but there's a lot of historical places 
helium's historical now because how long

2232
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:33,590
has helion been around for 13 years.
Yeah,

2233
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:38,240
that's a spot where universally people 
talk about that place.

2234
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:43,720
I feel like Acme Acme in Minneapolis,
laughing skull in Atlanta.

2235
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:50,240
That place is off the charts.
Intimate.

2236
01:36:50,241 --> 01:36:52,220
90 people.
Maybe if you've done it.

2237
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:52,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

2238
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,280
Fuck a curtain.
That goes amazing.

2239
01:36:55,540 --> 01:37:00,540
That's a good example of a room.
You're going down a hallway to a 

2240
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:00,560
restaurant.
Picture everybody.

2241
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:02,990
Everyone has to go to a club for the 
first time you go.

2242
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,810
It's in the back of a restaurant.
You go down a hallway,

2243
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:08,240
then all of a sudden,
even though it's a simple room,

2244
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:10,430
is there's a sound booth,
there's lights,

2245
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:12,830
the curtain shuts,
the lights go down,

2246
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:18,190
and when I think every second year in a 
club like that where they have 

2247
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:18,190
production,
you're like,

2248
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:19,580
oh,
this is something you know,

2249
01:37:19,581 --> 01:37:21,440
like the audience that might not know 
what to expect.

2250
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,290
Now they know it's going to be good 
sometimes even before the show starts,

2251
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:27,380
just the way the police conducted itself
and then the house lights go out.

2252
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:29,810
It's like a big deal.
So I love that.

2253
01:37:29,811 --> 01:37:31,610
That room is great.
Spot.

2254
01:37:31,611 --> 01:37:36,611
A lot of fun in that room.
It's another one of those really 

2255
01:37:36,611 --> 01:37:36,611
intimate places.
I don't even think that's 100 people.

2256
01:37:36,611 --> 01:37:37,670
Right?
80 five 80 people.

2257
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:39,200
Is that what it is?
Amazing.

2258
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:41,030
Yeah.
Those spots,

2259
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:41,840
man.
I counted.

2260
01:37:41,841 --> 01:37:44,050
I have a clicker because I'm going to.
Oh No,

2261
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:45,370
no,
don't know.

2262
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:47,480
That happened.
When someone did that,

2263
01:37:47,481 --> 01:37:51,200
like onstage made everybody call out a 
number at a club somewhere.

2264
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:57,710
Hope because probably to see like if 
there was more than they said 

2265
01:37:57,710 --> 01:38:00,621
Jacqueline,
he was working on some sort of a door 

2266
01:38:00,621 --> 01:38:00,621
deal and he thought there was more 
people in the room.

2267
01:38:00,621 --> 01:38:05,570
Then the club owner told him so he had 
the audience individually count out a 

2268
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:05,790
number.

2269
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:11,850
What?
Like we're gonna start from this table 

2270
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:11,850
over here and when I moved to the left,
your number one.

2271
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:13,050
Ready Sarah go number one,
two,

2272
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:14,230
three.
Hey,

2273
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,430
and people would just hook your word to 
three more number sitting there.

2274
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:22,860
That proves that people just.
Some people want to yell out.

2275
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:24,200
That was fun for them.
No one.

2276
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:25,830
How many people were going,
oh right,

2277
01:38:25,831 --> 01:38:30,240
we don't need to do this,
but I think it was like a 350 seat room.

2278
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:32,220
Wow.
Yeah,

2279
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:36,040
so you didn't have the material.
Maybe it's totally,

2280
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:38,310
totally,
totally possible,

2281
01:38:38,311 --> 01:38:41,070
but whatever it is,
that's how we found out.

2282
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:46,800
Went through the whole room and he got 
past the number that this guy said there

2283
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:49,860
were and then there was still more 
fucking people.

2284
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:52,350
I wonder if that's true.
It's true.

2285
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:54,360
I think it's true.
I think that it's the wait staff is what

2286
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:59,361
told me about it and I think they were 
very enthusiastic with their 

2287
01:38:59,361 --> 01:38:59,361
descriptions.

2288
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:04,680
So you think he caught them like a club 
owner trying to hide how many could be 

2289
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:05,460
the good clubs that have been around 
forever.

2290
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:09,350
Overwhelmingly,
I've had almost perfect experiences like

2291
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:14,390
the clubs that they're all pretty decent
so I forget sometimes what some of the 

2292
01:39:14,491 --> 01:39:19,491
sheisty are ones because you hear 
stories about people in the road like 

2293
01:39:19,491 --> 01:39:23,210
manipulating the money and stuff,
but you do hear that that that can 

2294
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:26,661
happen with some clubs.
I think some club owners develop a very 

2295
01:39:26,661 --> 01:39:28,540
animalistic animosity.
What?

2296
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:30,120
What is that word?
Animosity.

2297
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,280
That's not even a word.
It isn't.

2298
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:34,130
I know what you're going to say though.
I'm writing.

2299
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:36,390
When it came out of my mouth,
right as it was going out,

2300
01:39:36,391 --> 01:39:37,530
I was like,
is that a real word?

2301
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:42,300
You know,
you can't exactly towards comedy,

2302
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:45,060
but they developed this animosity 
between each other.

2303
01:39:45,061 --> 01:39:46,770
The club owners don't want to book you.

2304
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:48,690
You get mad at the club owners.
Then when you make it like,

2305
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:50,160
fuck that guy,
I want more money.

2306
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,120
Tell him,
fuck him,

2307
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:52,030
you know,
and you,

2308
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:57,110
there's this weird thing that happens,
like they knew you when you sucked and 

2309
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:57,900
then you know,
like as you're coming up,

2310
01:39:58,510 --> 01:39:59,390
there's,
you know,

2311
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:01,050
they don't want to pay him more and 
you're like,

2312
01:40:01,051 --> 01:40:06,051
but I make more now my headliner and you
get into this weird sort of thing with 

2313
01:40:06,051 --> 01:40:06,930
each other.
You know,

2314
01:40:06,931 --> 01:40:07,670
I think that,
that,

2315
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:12,700
that poisons the well for a lot of 
comedian club owner relationships,

2316
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:19,040
but we need them so bad.
Like you and I are not opening up a 

2317
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,280
comedy club is not going to happen.
Right?

2318
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:23,880
We need the Improv.
We need these clubs.

2319
01:40:23,881 --> 01:40:26,190
You need the ha ha in north Hollywood.
We need them.

2320
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:31,400
Like they,
like we all have to work together like 

2321
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:34,440
should be.
We all figure out a way to be nice to 

2322
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:34,440
each other.
Like we need each other.

2323
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,160
Yeah.
We're not going to do that.

2324
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:36,930
Let's.
I try and I,

2325
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:38,530
I not only did I try,
I do it too.

2326
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,740
As much as I complain about when they do
it wrong.

2327
01:40:40,741 --> 01:40:44,280
I always spend twice as much time giving
clubs,

2328
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:47,040
do it greatest shout outs and throw in 
love their way.

2329
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:48,180
There's a lot doall,
right?

2330
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:51,030
So important that you know what,
when I go to him,

2331
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:54,040
when I money was coming at

2332
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,090
me,
when I go to a brace,

2333
01:40:56,350 --> 01:41:01,350
like spring starting to hit me.
How dare you when I go to a place like 

2334
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:04,790
Portland,
uh,

2335
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,580
the helium and Portland,
Philadelphia,

2336
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:09,940
but where there's a manager or they run 
the place.

2337
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:11,110
Look,
I know they're stressed out,

2338
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:12,380
but they're good at hiding it.
Yeah,

2339
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:12,970
yeah,
yeah.

2340
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:15,460
They're professional always.
And I thought I couldn't do that.

2341
01:41:15,461 --> 01:41:17,090
I'd be frantic,
but they're always like,

2342
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:19,150
hey,
how you [inaudible]?

2343
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:20,910
And I think,
you know,

2344
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:21,880
I try to,
I try to go,

2345
01:41:21,881 --> 01:41:22,780
wow that,
you know,

2346
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:24,680
give a club like that,
you know,

2347
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:26,380
I would not exist.
I go,

2348
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,570
I don't even know how they do it.
Like it's so good.

2349
01:41:28,571 --> 01:41:31,030
I don't know if I could do that.
And this guy's like,

2350
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:33,050
do you remember Tom Sawyer from San 
Francisco?

2351
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:34,300
I know,
I know of him yet.

2352
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,010
He never worked for him.
I don't think so.

2353
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,200
Really?
He never worked at the old cops know,

2354
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:42,520
a little comms I once.
Did you work at big cobs?

2355
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:44,450
No,
I had opened up for.

2356
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,940
I did some shows there like through a,
you know,

2357
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:49,390
like a festival but never through the 
club.

2358
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:52,450
Yeah.
Well I just want to beat on it too much.

2359
01:41:52,451 --> 01:41:55,390
We're just so fucking lucky that we have
places to do it.

2360
01:41:55,740 --> 01:42:00,740
You know,
it's just a weird relationship that 

2361
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:01,990
comics and when it gets wet it gets 
followed up just because both parties,

2362
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:04,720
both parties have some work to do.
It's really.

2363
01:42:04,721 --> 01:42:08,380
If they were in therapy,
you both got some things you can fix and

2364
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:10,270
as long as.
Because it is true,

2365
01:42:10,271 --> 01:42:15,271
it's like I'm not unaware of what you're
saying because it's just comedians for 

2366
01:42:15,271 --> 01:42:17,200
every club owner that may be ripped 
somebody off,

2367
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:22,201
which of course they exist.
There's also a comedian that thinks 

2368
01:42:22,201 --> 01:42:22,670
everybody's ripping them off and nobody 
is so,

2369
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:26,650
but it's just that when you're not 
getting booked,

2370
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:30,790
it's real easy to develop that sort of 
animosity between you and a club.

2371
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:32,200
There's just,
if you're not,

2372
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:37,380
you can't work and you think that other 
guys who are not as good as you and 

2373
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:40,381
they're getting work and then you get 
frustrated and you're young and dumb 

2374
01:42:40,381 --> 01:42:41,350
already,
you know you can have that sort of weird

2375
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:45,070
complicated relationship.
It's just one of those weird things.

2376
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:48,670
Club owners and artists have always.
There's always been disputes right?

2377
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:52,930
Way Back into the day where they do 
jumped off the fucking roof of the hotel

2378
01:42:52,931 --> 01:42:57,931
next to the comedy store and that was.
That was at a protest between the 

2379
01:42:57,931 --> 01:43:01,420
comedians protesting at the club.
They walked out,

2380
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:05,120
there was a strike,
there was an la comedy strike because no

2381
01:43:05,121 --> 01:43:10,121
one was getting any money and these 
clubs were smashing it and we weren't 

2382
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:11,580
getting any of the money.
Like it's always been that.

2383
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:14,290
And that still goes on today,
like the UCB.

2384
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:16,660
UCB doesn't pay people who don't have 
to.

2385
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,660
If you're doing great,
I mean it just.

2386
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:23,670
Some forces them,
they could keep doing whatever the fuck 

2387
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:26,221
they want to do through there.
There's also the of good blood out there

2388
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:27,640
too.
Sure.

2389
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:31,900
But yeah,
there's a lot of good little communities

2390
01:43:31,901 --> 01:43:34,360
to or guys put together a comedy night 
somewhere,

2391
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:37,060
you know,
and some do a great job at that.

2392
01:43:37,061 --> 01:43:38,950
I'm always in always in all that.
When.

2393
01:43:38,951 --> 01:43:41,080
So when you go to a comedy night and 
someone did it,

2394
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:42,150
you're like,
oh,

2395
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,530
they took a one bar and made it a,
you know,

2396
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:46,420
every little thing is right.
Sure.

2397
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:49,150
People get,
some people really know how to produce a

2398
01:43:49,151 --> 01:43:50,070
show.
Yeah,

2399
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,890
for sure.
It's always fun to walk into that

2400
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:57,130
and they just found a good spot to.
There was a good spot that I've worked 

2401
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:58,630
at only once and it was in it and see.
No,

2402
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,340
it was really weird.
It was.

2403
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:04,880
I'm telling you,
I mean it was a five minute walk from my

2404
01:44:04,881 --> 01:44:06,460
house.
That's when I lived in.

2405
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:11,710
I lived off of white oak and I could 
just walk down there and go to this 

2406
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:15,251
weird comedy club.
I never worked there the entire time I 

2407
01:44:15,251 --> 01:44:15,410
lived there.
I never worked there.

2408
01:44:15,411 --> 01:44:19,010
When I did one set there and I was like,
what is this place?

2409
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:22,130
This place is what club?
I don't remember the name of it,

2410
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:25,260
but it was a bar in the front and you'd 
go past the bar,

2411
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:30,320
this back room,
and it was like all people that I'd 

2412
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,850
never seen do standup.
I never seen him at the store and there 

2413
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:33,860
were some of the laugh factory knew of 
some of the Improv.

2414
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:38,210
It seemed like they had either just 
started or they were crazy.

2415
01:44:38,211 --> 01:44:40,220
It was.
Maybe it was the night that I was there,

2416
01:44:40,221 --> 01:44:41,810
but I was like,
this place is nuts.

2417
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:45,800
And how long ago was this?
More than 20 years.

2418
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:49,880
Yeah,
this was like 95 I think.

2419
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:53,060
Yeah,
it was weird.

2420
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:58,250
So weird little comedy.
Like there's this whole another world 

2421
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:58,250
worlds out there,
man.

2422
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:01,910
And if you go like into Orange County 
and in San Diego,

2423
01:45:01,911 --> 01:45:04,000
San Diego's got its own fucking scene.
Right,

2424
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:06,230
right.
You know Santa Barbara,

2425
01:45:06,990 --> 01:45:10,760
a Santa Barbara?
Yes.

2426
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:15,820
All these different plates.
Santa Barbara I don't think has that 

2427
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:15,920
comedy club anymore.
I heard that comment.

2428
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,650
See if Santa Barbara as a common thing 
once a month.

2429
01:45:18,651 --> 01:45:22,190
They do about.
It might've been like six months ago.

2430
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:27,430
San Francisco has a scene.
They got to see in Seattle's got a 

2431
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,430
scene,
you know,

2432
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:28,580
there are some scenes out there,
there's some comedy scenes.

2433
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:31,190
It's just like how many of them are 
really thriving.

2434
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:32,990
It takes a lot of club owners,
man.

2435
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:38,320
That's the thing is what I'm saying to 
these people that don't get along so 

2436
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,470
good with club owners if they're not 
doing it.

2437
01:45:39,471 --> 01:45:44,471
We're not gonna comedy hideaway in Santa
Barbara says closed right now.

2438
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:49,670
Ours is.
It does it mean closed forever.

2439
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:55,280
He'll do random shows like 1:00
PM in different.

2440
01:45:55,281 --> 01:45:57,380
He still does.
He still has shows.

2441
01:45:57,381 --> 01:45:59,740
It's just always under comedy hideaway 
and that's where we found it.

2442
01:45:59,741 --> 01:46:00,380
Oh,
he's doing it.

2443
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:01,490
They're doing it.
They're.

2444
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:02,120
Oh,
okay.

2445
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:02,990
Oh No.
Oh,

2446
01:46:02,991 --> 01:46:04,580
I get it.
So it's a hideaway.

2447
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:06,800
So it's like a Gig,
like oh,

2448
01:46:06,801 --> 01:46:08,330
he goes to different spots.
Oh,

2449
01:46:08,331 --> 01:46:13,331
okay.
So sometimes you'll be in the same spot 

2450
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:13,331
for the weekend.
Sometimes it bounces around.

2451
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:13,331
Oh,
okay.

2452
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:18,100
I know I'm his manager that I'm telling 
the kid he's got to be more specific 

2453
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,480
with the social media marketing.
I don't know man.

2454
01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:25,481
It's like that.
But what makes a scene is a club owner 

2455
01:46:25,481 --> 01:46:25,670
like Wendy,
Wendy from the comedy works in Denver.

2456
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:27,860
She makes the scene,
that's the club owner.

2457
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,410
She's the one who puts her finances at 
risk.

2458
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:35,560
She's the one who manages it.
She runs two clubs and in those two 

2459
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:36,470
clubs she ran.
She runs currently.

2460
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:41,450
She created the Denver scene.
Mitzi created the La scene at the store,

2461
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:46,160
mean Mitsis guidance her like her,
what she tolerated,

2462
01:46:46,161 --> 01:46:50,960
what she enforced and what she preferred
and who she gave enthusiasm too.

2463
01:46:50,990 --> 01:46:52,740
She,
she like shaped,

2464
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:54,840
shaped so many comics.
Man.

2465
01:46:55,590 --> 01:47:00,590
You know.
So there's a few of those club owners 

2466
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:00,590
that are like super,
super special,

2467
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:00,990
like really,
really important people.

2468
01:47:01,010 --> 01:47:01,750
They,
they just,

2469
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:05,070
they create an environment where shit 
pops out of.

2470
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:07,500
No,
I say it's the closest thing,

2471
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:10,230
like presenting,
knowing how to present something,

2472
01:47:10,231 --> 01:47:13,260
especially when it's comedy.
I'm an off whenever somebody,

2473
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:15,480
you know,
whatever you think you would do that.

2474
01:47:15,481 --> 01:47:20,481
I mean you've designed them.
Do you ever think that you would think 

2475
01:47:20,481 --> 01:47:21,570
I'd want to own a club because I get a 
comedian's can be

2476
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,340
hard to deal with.
Some of them are just crazy,

2477
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:26,170
some of them you just,
you just can't,

2478
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:28,030
you just can't,
can't do it.

2479
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:30,090
I get it or I bet.
Well,

2480
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:33,350
you know,
the other reason I was close once maybe,

2481
01:47:33,790 --> 01:47:36,710
but because let's say there's somebody I
like as a comedian,

2482
01:47:36,711 --> 01:47:41,711
but maybe the tragic hotel,
I don't need to know that and then be 

2483
01:47:41,711 --> 01:47:41,711
mad at them.
Oh,

2484
01:47:41,711 --> 01:47:42,350
what happened?
How come you don't talk to blah,

2485
01:47:42,351 --> 01:47:43,160
blah,
blah anymore?

2486
01:47:43,610 --> 01:47:46,160
Because I make my club in Philadelphia 
Real Nice.

2487
01:47:46,161 --> 01:47:49,330
And then he went in and he know they 
toured the curtain down in the.

2488
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:52,460
I don't want to not like him for that.
So let me not go to a club and deal with

2489
01:47:52,461 --> 01:47:55,370
anybody I know on a business level.
That's a good point.

2490
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:57,380
That's a very good.
People do it and it's hard,

2491
01:47:57,381 --> 01:47:59,900
but they'd empathize with what I'm 
saying more than anything.

2492
01:48:00,110 --> 01:48:05,110
So it also says we're not delusional 
when we complain about clubs because it 

2493
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:05,110
says,
yeah,

2494
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:05,110
we get it.
There's some,

2495
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:07,520
there's some when they,
when they do it right,

2496
01:48:07,521 --> 01:48:10,760
there's some comedians that shit on it.
They ruin a condo that they're trying to

2497
01:48:10,761 --> 01:48:13,010
make sure I get it,
but overwhelmingly

2498
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:17,950
it's probably no,
it's trying to be fair.

2499
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:18,670
No,
you're.

2500
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:23,680
You are trying to be fair.
There's just certain amount of people 

2501
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:23,830
that are nuts.
They're going to fuck places up.

2502
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:28,860
You're gonna ruin things.
They don't give a shit club or whatever 

2503
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:29,590
they do in the relationship that the 
club has with some other business,

2504
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:30,730
you know,
it's just,

2505
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,620
you know,
comedians are crazy.

2506
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:39,290
Here's me on the phone.
What he sheet low for what?

2507
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:44,380
Let's not even normal.
That's not even normal as a good one.

2508
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:49,870
Yeah.
I mean I know he's crazy and then 

2509
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:49,870
somebody that I.
well,

2510
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:53,041
you know,
he said he wanted to pay for the steam 

2511
01:48:53,041 --> 01:48:53,041
cleaning.
Well,

2512
01:48:53,041 --> 01:48:55,981
I don't know.
We'll get new carpet styria man when 

2513
01:48:57,670 --> 01:48:59,410
they spray diarrhea before.
I love it.

2514
01:48:59,411 --> 01:49:00,940
You know why?
Because that to me,

2515
01:49:00,941 --> 01:49:03,920
if you're saying the wrong thing.
So it sounds like just,

2516
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,760
just shitting diarrhea all over,
just the,

2517
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:09,970
but any,
that's not even your fault with a lot of

2518
01:49:09,971 --> 01:49:10,240
people.

2519
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:15,040
A lot of people it's like they don't 
probably realize what they're doing.

2520
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:17,380
They're doing it.
And they think they're right,

2521
01:49:17,590 --> 01:49:22,590
but they're just looking at it from 
their own personal selfish perspective 

2522
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:26,371
because they're excited about what 
they're saying and because they're 

2523
01:49:26,371 --> 01:49:27,580
engaged in a contest,
it's not just that they're talking about

2524
01:49:27,581 --> 01:49:32,581
stuff,
they're engaged in a contest they're 

2525
01:49:32,581 --> 01:49:32,740
trying to win and that's where the 
diarrhea comes out there.

2526
01:49:32,741 --> 01:49:35,410
Just throwing it at you and get in your 
face.

2527
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:36,660
It's like,
oh,

2528
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,840
this is this a contest and they'll suck 
you in.

2529
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:43,300
Suck you into it.
See,

2530
01:49:43,301 --> 01:49:48,301
that's what I think one of the big 
things is wrong with people today and 

2531
01:49:48,301 --> 01:49:52,400
it's been wrong of me in the past.
Get into these conflicts for no fucking 

2532
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:53,200
reason.
It's not worth.

2533
01:49:53,201 --> 01:49:55,510
It is no fun in that.
It's stupid.

2534
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:59,050
If you want to get in conflicts should 
be doing difficult shit with your life.

2535
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,700
There's a lot of different difficult 
things to do.

2536
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:02,590
Don't like getting in arguments with 
people.

2537
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:05,020
Have you done it in the past ever for 
arguments?

2538
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:06,100
People were nothing.
Yeah,

2539
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:07,690
for sure.
Fuck.

2540
01:50:07,691 --> 01:50:09,760
You's a in the car window,
you know?

2541
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:10,800
No,
fuck you.

2542
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:12,910
Fuck you.
You feel like such a loser after you get

2543
01:50:12,911 --> 01:50:14,890
out of there.
Like what did I even say?

2544
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:16,870
Yeah,
we've all done that.

2545
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:19,430
Somebody cuts you off or someone's on 
their phone,

2546
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:21,310
they almost slammed into you and you 
freak out and they.

2547
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:23,470
They give you the bird and you're like,
fuck you.

2548
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:24,790
Yeah,
for sure.

2549
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:26,980
And now almost zero,
almost zero,

2550
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,740
almost zero.
Most of the time I'm pretty cool.

2551
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:35,520
I just put,
it's a matter of always thinking about 

2552
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:35,520
it.
It's a matter of always recognizing like

2553
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:40,050
these are just stupid impulses.
Don't just follow any childish impulse 

2554
01:50:40,050 --> 01:50:42,040
like some 13 year old,
he's good as first boner.

2555
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:44,230
Like use your fucking brain.
Don't yell,

2556
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,400
just use your brain.

2557
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:51,610
I always thought I just more than 
anything because it's usually not even 

2558
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:51,950
involving me when I still witnessed 
this.

2559
01:50:51,990 --> 01:50:54,920
The finger out the window.
Fuck you.

2560
01:50:56,230 --> 01:50:59,930
Who from a calm place?
Who are you and you know what?

2561
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:05,170
I've seen it a civil person that 
probably is about to sit down at a 

2562
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:05,750
restaurant and then probably a 
relatively nice guy,

2563
01:51:05,751 --> 01:51:09,770
but that's this.
If you're 40 years old or 20 or whatever

2564
01:51:09,771 --> 01:51:10,550
age.
The younger,

2565
01:51:10,551 --> 01:51:12,860
the more understandable,
but when you see,

2566
01:51:12,861 --> 01:51:16,340
let's go with a 40 year old putting his 
finger out the fuck.

2567
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,930
I go,
who are you?

2568
01:51:17,931 --> 01:51:22,931
Where are you going?
How can you be the most value to your 

2569
01:51:22,931 --> 01:51:24,110
children's lives?
If that's the way you express yourself,

2570
01:51:24,290 --> 01:51:25,040
don't tell me,
Oh,

2571
01:51:25,041 --> 01:51:30,041
I'll do that,
but I know that's got a leak into 

2572
01:51:30,041 --> 01:51:30,041
everything you do.
You're putting your hand out the window.

2573
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:33,600
40 fault.
Like what?

2574
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:34,790
Who are you?

2575
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:39,860
How are you?
You should treat everybody in the other 

2576
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:43,320
car as if they're a giant friendly 
linebacker.

2577
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:48,240
Like don't ever say I'll fuck you up.
Don't ever say I'll kick your ass.

2578
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:51,450
Treat them with like some.
Have a little bit of fear of them.

2579
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:54,120
Don't want to be mad at you.
Lay back.

2580
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:56,580
That's how you should treat everybody.
If we all just did that,

2581
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:01,760
we'd all get along great.
You know you don't look at some giant 

2582
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:01,760
ass.
I'd go,

2583
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,740
I'd go to this gym.
These nfl players go there and it's 

2584
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:05,740
Hilarious,
man.

2585
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:05,740
I'm like,
excuse me,

2586
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:06,340
pardon me,
Woo.

2587
01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:08,700
Dakota dudes.
Elbows and shit.

2588
01:52:08,701 --> 01:52:11,850
Trying to get to the weight stacks.
They're enormous people.

2589
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:15,030
I mean some of these guys are like six 
foot four,

2590
01:52:15,031 --> 01:52:17,580
300 plus pounds.
Just enormous,

2591
01:52:17,581 --> 01:52:20,190
enormous fucking people just show a 
little.

2592
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:25,460
Have a little respect.
If those guys were in cars all around 

2593
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:25,460
you,
you wouldn't be yelling,

2594
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:25,650
fuck you.
Pull over,

2595
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:27,450
pull over,
pull over.

2596
01:52:27,630 --> 01:52:30,390
You wouldn't do that because these guys 
will smash you.

2597
01:52:30,391 --> 01:52:31,950
They're not even the same thing as you.

2598
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,790
That's the reason that it makes me 
laugh,

2599
01:52:34,791 --> 01:52:37,640
that behaviors,
because it's not always a maniac in real

2600
01:52:37,641 --> 01:52:42,641
life,
but they should see their behaviors 

2601
01:52:42,641 --> 01:52:42,641
maniac like because it is.
It's like,

2602
01:52:42,641 --> 01:52:43,250
do you know what it from what?

2603
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:44,360
Do you know where it comes from?

2604
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:48,520
Just not being able to express yourself.
No,

2605
01:52:48,521 --> 01:52:49,580
no.
When you're in a car,

2606
01:52:49,581 --> 01:52:50,840
you're worried your,
your,

2607
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:52,610
your,
your senses are ramped up.

2608
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:56,240
Like if you're,
if 10 is like full awareness,

2609
01:52:56,330 --> 01:53:01,330
you're like six or seven were normal.
I feel like I one like you're already 

2610
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:05,651
like kind of wrapped up because 
everything's moving fast around you and 

2611
01:53:05,651 --> 01:53:07,550
try and stay calm and someone's doing 
something to try to get your you fucking

2612
01:53:07,551 --> 01:53:10,880
piece of shit.
You're wrapped up already.

2613
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,600
Yeah.
That's why when you're late,

2614
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:19,770
when you're late for some of the.
Even me and I'm a pretty civil civil 

2615
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:21,520
person and I try to stop it,
but if I'm super late and nervous,

2616
01:53:21,850 --> 01:53:25,270
I will say to the person doing the most 
mundane thing,

2617
01:53:25,271 --> 01:53:27,130
what the fuck are you doing?

2618
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:29,540
Exactly.
Exactly.

2619
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:32,830
At least I never go.
I will say this,

2620
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:35,960
go into traffic.
Zero out the window,

2621
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:41,050
zero talking about this is in the kid,
but even in the contents of your own 

2622
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:41,050
car,
you have to be.

2623
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:44,090
You should be proud of your behavior,
but at least I know well enough when I'm

2624
01:53:44,091 --> 01:53:49,091
doing that,
that's got to be for me and I should 

2625
01:53:49,091 --> 01:53:49,091
work on that too.

2626
01:53:49,091 --> 01:53:52,340
I had a dude scream at me and take his 
shirt off to show me his tattoos and 

2627
01:53:54,691 --> 01:53:59,691
then.
And then he called me a rich piece of 

2628
01:53:59,691 --> 01:53:59,880
shit.
I was not rich at the time,

2629
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:05,100
but I did have a white suburban and I 
guess white suburban made you think?

2630
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:07,740
I mean I wasn't famous at the time.
He didn't know who the fuck I was,

2631
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:13,100
but I don't remember what it was about,
but I remember this dude took his shirt 

2632
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:13,350
off to show me his tattoos and I started
pointing out,

2633
01:54:13,370 --> 01:54:14,220
I'm laughing.
I'm like,

2634
01:54:14,221 --> 01:54:15,310
ah.
I go,

2635
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:18,260
did you take your shirt off to show me 
your tattoos too?

2636
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:19,740
So that I don't think you're a tough 
guy.

2637
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:21,480
His leg is did.
I'm like,

2638
01:54:21,481 --> 01:54:26,481
that is hilarious,
and so I'm yelling this at him and he's 

2639
01:54:26,481 --> 01:54:28,020
getting more and more red in the face 
and I go,

2640
01:54:28,021 --> 01:54:29,100
that's hilarious.

2641
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:31,350
You took goes,
I'll fucking kick your fucking ass.

2642
01:54:31,351 --> 01:54:33,680
You fucking faggot.
You rich piece of shit.

2643
01:54:33,681 --> 01:54:35,340
I'm like,
rich piece of shit.

2644
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:39,150
Wow.
By and I just drove.

2645
01:54:39,450 --> 01:54:41,940
At least I was thinking at least I'm 
driving this big ass truck.

2646
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:44,310
If like he slammed into me,
he's gonna get fucked up.

2647
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:50,180
Huge.
Nobody thinks to is ever ready for like 

2648
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:51,840
to be called out because he knows why 
she was so stupid.

2649
01:54:51,841 --> 01:54:54,300
He thought I'd be scared of him because 
he's got tattoos everywhere.

2650
01:54:55,290 --> 01:54:56,610
Meanwhile,
as soon as he took his shirt off,

2651
01:54:56,611 --> 01:54:58,830
I was convinced I could fuck them up.
I was like,

2652
01:54:58,831 --> 01:55:01,920
this dude doesn't work out.
There's no way he knows anything.

2653
01:55:02,370 --> 01:55:03,990
There's no way.
I mean,

2654
01:55:03,991 --> 01:55:06,890
he was just like a guy,
you know,

2655
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,900
it wasn't like a scary guy,
but he had tattoos everywhere,

2656
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:13,080
like all over his neck and cit and they 
weren't even good.

2657
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:17,700
I like tattoos.
It was just such a stupid thing,

2658
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:22,940
but I mean,
I bet if I knew that guy in real life 

2659
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:25,460
and we were just together in a fucking 
office building and he worked in one 

2660
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:26,580
office and I worked in and be like,
what's up man?

2661
01:55:26,610 --> 01:55:27,600
What's going on?
Everything cool.

2662
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:32,830
We live in friendly shit.
It's just this weird thing when you're 

2663
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:33,870
on a highway and everybody's ramped up.
Everybody's nervous.

2664
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:37,140
You don't even realize you're nervous.
Even if you're calm and you're good,

2665
01:55:37,141 --> 01:55:38,910
you're always ready to do this.
You always ready.

2666
01:55:38,911 --> 01:55:40,860
Somebody locked up.
She's hit the brakes.

2667
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,180
Oh,
look at that is the fucking thing in the

2668
01:55:42,181 --> 01:55:42,830
world.
Got Shit.

2669
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:44,080
You're always ready for that.

2670
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:49,270
You're ready for that.
That's why when I go to my house to 

2671
01:55:49,771 --> 01:55:54,771
Silver Lake,
some people want to get on the highway 

2672
01:55:54,771 --> 01:55:54,771
and I go,
I don't know.

2673
01:55:54,771 --> 01:55:56,160
I don't want to get on the highway.
First of all,

2674
01:55:56,161 --> 01:55:57,510
it always ends up being about the same 
time,

2675
01:55:57,511 --> 01:56:01,260
but even if it's five minutes longer on 
surface streets on a highway,

2676
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:03,960
I'm,
I feel like I'm getting too out there in

2677
01:56:03,961 --> 01:56:08,961
this highway world.
I just want to go somewhere where I'm 

2678
01:56:08,961 --> 01:56:08,961
not on the highway.
Do you know what I mean?

2679
01:56:08,961 --> 01:56:11,400
On the side road I can handle it,
but on the,

2680
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:13,680
on the highway I just get stressed out a
little more.

2681
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:15,510
So I'm like,
I'll say if it's 10 minutes longer,

2682
01:56:15,511 --> 01:56:16,560
I don't care.
Yeah,

2683
01:56:16,561 --> 01:56:18,810
there's not a bad idea.
It's not a bad idea.

2684
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:20,580
It's chilling.
It's more relaxed.

2685
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:21,600
Chill.
I'll teach.

2686
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:22,980
Stop.
Slow down.

2687
01:56:22,981 --> 01:56:23,180
Stop.

2688
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:27,150
No one's driving that fast.
Take Pico from center city to my house.

2689
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:33,040
I liked going over Laurel Canyon.
You know when you go into Hollywood it's

2690
01:56:33,041 --> 01:56:34,170
like,
it's more chill.

2691
01:56:34,230 --> 01:56:36,030
It's Kinda cool.
Get that cool.

2692
01:56:36,031 --> 01:56:39,840
Drive down that winding road down and 
winding road down is excellent,

2693
01:56:39,841 --> 01:56:41,610
man.
It reminds you you're in La.

2694
01:56:41,810 --> 01:56:46,810
Yeah,
and I always think of like these bad 

2695
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:46,810
motherfuckers that live right there on 
the road like,

2696
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:48,060
well,
who do you have to be to be so confident

2697
01:56:48,061 --> 01:56:53,061
and people that you buy a house right 
there on Laurel Canyon around one of 

2698
01:56:53,061 --> 01:56:55,380
those corners where someone could easily
miscalculate and slammed right into your

2699
01:56:55,381 --> 01:57:00,381
car and slamming your house.
You know those streets like Laurel in 

2700
01:57:00,381 --> 01:57:03,921
particular,
it's like there's a lot of like 

2701
01:57:03,921 --> 01:57:06,270
jockeying for position on Laurel.
I saw a guy the other day take a chance,

2702
01:57:06,271 --> 01:57:10,380
move and dump into the left lane to 
oncoming traffic to pass a guy on laurel

2703
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:11,850
and I was like,
whoa.

2704
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:17,240
That is a.
That is a like you're committing to 

2705
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:17,290
being a cocksucker.
Like you're going down.

2706
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:19,320
There's just no way.
You know,

2707
01:57:19,321 --> 01:57:21,390
if someone's coming,
you don't have enough time.

2708
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:23,910
And if they're coming up the hill,
like you're coming down the hill,

2709
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:26,970
the same kind of assholishness we've got
a real problem here.

2710
01:57:26,971 --> 01:57:31,971
Like you're going into the left lane 
that's put that right next to your 

2711
01:57:31,971 --> 01:57:33,160
house.
What these people's,

2712
01:57:33,170 --> 01:57:34,920
their houses are right there,
man.

2713
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:39,330
Like you could reach out and smack their
mailman in the ass to drive by.

2714
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:44,840
It's crazy.
I always think that like on the highway 

2715
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,631
when there's an apartment building,
so close to the highway that you could 

2716
01:57:47,631 --> 01:57:48,180
forget something and go,
hey,

2717
01:57:48,210 --> 01:57:53,210
I'm pulling around in the overpass,
come over to the window and throw me my 

2718
01:57:53,210 --> 01:57:56,990
shoes.
Like an episode of the honeymooners or 

2719
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:56,990
some shit.
Right?

2720
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:01,740
Yeah.
They have a string.

2721
01:58:01,741 --> 01:58:03,540
Maybe they run from the.
I don't know,

2722
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:06,390
whenever I look at a science fiction 
movie about like the future,

2723
01:58:06,391 --> 01:58:09,780
like a district nine district nine.
Great fucking movie man.

2724
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:15,500
Um,
but one of the things about these like 

2725
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:15,510
Super Uber congested cities,
you look at them and you go,

2726
01:58:15,511 --> 01:58:16,980
okay,
is that common?

2727
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:22,100
Is that like going to be everywhere and 
we going to be really living in this 

2728
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:24,981
sort of weird dystopian future.
New York City is in the perfect spot,

2729
01:58:25,650 --> 01:58:27,750
right?
Because it's not quite dystopian,

2730
01:58:27,751 --> 01:58:30,750
but it's definitely exceptional.
Like those views that you get.

2731
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Like a buddy of mine,
he had an apartment in Brooklyn on the 

2732
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:36,720
water facing the city,
which I think is even.

2733
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:39,060
I don't know if it's better than being 
in the city,

2734
01:58:39,061 --> 01:58:42,490
but it's pretty fucking stunning and I 
just was in his living room going,

2735
01:58:42,491 --> 01:58:43,900
Holy Shit,
man,

2736
01:58:43,901 --> 01:58:47,040
this is crazy.
Like this view is crazy.

2737
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:49,270
It's beautiful.
It's stunning.

2738
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:55,830
But it,
if that keeps going right and then it 

2739
01:58:55,830 --> 01:58:58,420
becomes this monolithic huge favela 
like,

2740
01:58:58,421 --> 01:59:03,421
you know,
some crazy like completely stuffed with 

2741
01:59:03,421 --> 01:59:06,721
people and chickens and dogs running 
around and I mean like all these future 

2742
01:59:06,721 --> 01:59:07,180
dystopia movies,
they're all.

2743
01:59:07,181 --> 01:59:12,181
Everything is all.
It's not like everything's amazing in 

2744
01:59:12,181 --> 01:59:14,341
the future.
We have these huge super populated 

2745
01:59:14,341 --> 01:59:14,800
cities and everything's perfect now.
It's all like way more crime.

2746
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:19,200
Way more craziness.
Oh God.

2747
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:28,410
Well it's just thinking.
I think people are improving and you 

2748
01:59:28,410 --> 01:59:28,450
think people are improving?
We both do.

2749
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,910
We think life's improved.
You're kidding.

2750
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:31,840
No,
no,

2751
01:59:31,841 --> 01:59:33,820
no,
but I'm saying there,

2752
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:38,080
there is a problem with the numbers,
the actual raw numbers of us.

2753
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:43,440
Like if you go back just a few decades,
the amount of people was like 5 billion 

2754
01:59:44,831 --> 01:59:47,660
less and it's not that long.
I mean,

2755
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:50,290
I think you go back to the eighties.
What?

2756
01:59:50,390 --> 01:59:52,570
What is,
what we've done this before,

2757
01:59:52,571 --> 01:59:57,571
and I know I've,
I always forget and I probably should 

2758
01:59:57,571 --> 01:59:58,660
remember it,
but what was world population in 1985?

2759
01:59:58,690 --> 02:00:00,690
That's when I got out of high school.
Uh,

2760
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:05,170
want to say it was less than 3 billion.
That's what I want to say.

2761
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,460
No,
I'm wrong.

2762
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:09,440
5 billion.
Little less than $5.

2763
02:00:09,441 --> 02:00:10,510
Million.
Okay.

2764
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:15,870
I feel a little bit better anyway,
during that time from 1985 to 2018,

2765
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:18,900
it's now.
Is it 7 billion or has it hit eight?

2766
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:22,780
Because the world population was real 
close to eight.

2767
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,180
Seven.
Fuck man.

2768
02:00:25,690 --> 02:00:30,690
That's a lot of people gaining more than
2 billion people in just a few decades.

2769
02:00:32,471 --> 02:00:35,470
So you keep doing that.
You do that a few decades more.

2770
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:40,500
Does it accelerate?
You must because there's 2 billion more 

2771
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,320
people having people.
So it's got to accelerate it.

2772
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:41,320
Alright.

2773
02:00:41,390 --> 02:00:43,640
Exponential.
Every problem you list.

2774
02:00:43,641 --> 02:00:45,590
I feel like I connected right back to 
old people.

2775
02:00:45,950 --> 02:00:50,950
Like the population.
We just live in a society that have 

2776
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:50,950
kids,
have kids.

2777
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:51,210
No one goes,
hey,

2778
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:56,220
we'll learn about yourself.
And when you really know what your 

2779
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:56,220
patients are,
then if you start,

2780
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:56,290
you'll see at a certain time you might 
be with.

2781
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:57,860
No,
no one is just that type of.

2782
02:00:57,861 --> 02:00:59,030
You have to have kids.
Okay.

2783
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:01,110
That's older people,
you know,

2784
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:04,610
that put that thought out there.
The energy problem.

2785
02:01:05,030 --> 02:01:08,480
If like kids were,
if we were just letting kids lead,

2786
02:01:08,481 --> 02:01:13,481
we'd have electric cars already.
Like they already had that information 

2787
02:01:13,481 --> 02:01:17,951
back then and we just.
The real problem with electric cars to 

2788
02:01:17,951 --> 02:01:18,380
the batteries.
Well I mean even still true.

2789
02:01:19,370 --> 02:01:24,370
What about just musk is pretty much at 
the top of the heap when it comes to 

2790
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:28,571
figuring out electric car technology.
I don't think there's anybody that's 

2791
02:01:28,571 --> 02:01:31,961
ever had it nailed down like him before.
I mean there's a few different car 

2792
02:01:31,961 --> 02:01:31,961
companies that make really good electric
cars.

2793
02:01:31,961 --> 02:01:36,760
Fiskar makes a really good one,
but it's on those batteries.

2794
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:39,860
Like this is like this is not something 
we could have had years ago.

2795
02:01:39,861 --> 02:01:40,010
And

2796
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,550
then what about solar power?
Solar power is absolutely viable.

2797
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:45,890
And especially in California where it's 
raining,

2798
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:48,040
it's been raining out here for a few 
days and there is like,

2799
02:01:48,050 --> 02:01:50,150
it's amazing.
It's like we live in Seattle,

2800
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:51,950
you know,
everything's all green and shit,

2801
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:57,100
but it's sunny most of the time and we 
could just be collecting energy for 

2802
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:57,100
that.
This,

2803
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:58,440
there's political issues with that.
There's like,

2804
02:01:58,490 --> 02:02:03,490
you know,
you'd have to get the infrastructure 

2805
02:02:03,490 --> 02:02:03,490
ready.
You'd have to,

2806
02:02:03,490 --> 02:02:03,710
you could sell back to the grid.
There's that.

2807
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:07,790
People do do that.
There's a lot of like difficulty though.

2808
02:02:07,791 --> 02:02:11,300
Apparently Brian Kaylin went through 
that when he got his house solar powered

2809
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:13,700
and he said,
is it really a lot of red tape?

2810
02:02:13,701 --> 02:02:18,701
And he goes and it seems like they're 
trying to discourage you from doing it 

2811
02:02:18,701 --> 02:02:19,580
and make it difficult for you to do it 
for you to switch over to electric.

2812
02:02:19,610 --> 02:02:24,610
They because he had his installed and 
hooked up for months before it got 

2813
02:02:24,610 --> 02:02:26,630
switched on with the grid.
It was like real issue.

2814
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:31,580
And then even more so I think if you 
want to go off grid so you can use solar

2815
02:02:31,581 --> 02:02:34,190
power and have no connection to the 
grid,

2816
02:02:34,410 --> 02:02:36,830
that's a slippery slope.
And in some places,

2817
02:02:36,831 --> 02:02:41,831
I don't know if you can do that.
I think some places might actually 

2818
02:02:41,831 --> 02:02:42,260
prevent you from doing that,
which is really weird.

2819
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:45,100
They can prevent you.
You will only use all.

2820
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:51,010
No one else has a dog should be 
basically that's what they're saying is 

2821
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,020
what they're saying because that's not 
the tone.

2822
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,970
They say your power anymore.
But thanks.

2823
02:02:58,990 --> 02:03:00,840
No,
you wouldn't be on all great.

2824
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:03,290
How do you think they would sell that?
Like just pull up.

2825
02:03:03,291 --> 02:03:05,720
Just guessing.
Like how do they make that make sense?

2826
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:10,780
They would have to have some regulations
like we don't know shit about your 

2827
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:10,780
solar.

2828
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:12,380
We don't,
we don't know if it's dangerous.

2829
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:17,381
We don't know what you're up to.
So I mean they could sell it in any way 

2830
02:03:17,381 --> 02:03:21,701
they want.
If they're doing it in order to save 

2831
02:03:21,701 --> 02:03:24,280
their constituents money or in to do the
bidding of whatever special interest 

2832
02:03:25,671 --> 02:03:28,400
group is lobbying for them to do it.
I mean,

2833
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:33,680
that's why they do those things.
They don't do those things because they 

2834
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:33,680
make sense.
You know,

2835
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:33,890
they don't do it through those things 
because they're logical.

2836
02:03:33,891 --> 02:03:35,900
Hey,
don't don't get that free power.

2837
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:40,520
Let me make it confusing to get that 
free power.

2838
02:03:40,521 --> 02:03:41,930
Make it real hard for you.
Turn on,

2839
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:43,520
I just got to stretch it out a few 
months.

2840
02:03:43,521 --> 02:03:44,930
You've got to keep paying me for a few 
months.

2841
02:03:45,110 --> 02:03:47,540
If they can just do that with a million 
customers,

2842
02:03:47,890 --> 02:03:51,260
you have 3 million more months of 
billable hours.

2843
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:56,410
If they wanted to do it that way,
if they just made it a policy to act 

2844
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:56,410
slower.

2845
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:57,080
I don't know how it works,
man it,

2846
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:02,280
but I know how money works.
I bet there's truth to what you're 

2847
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:05,531
saying.
There's so much money involved and they 

2848
02:04:05,531 --> 02:04:06,830
don't make power companies because 
they're altruistic.

2849
02:04:06,831 --> 02:04:08,990
Beautiful.
People want everybody to watch TV.

2850
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:11,840
They do because they want that cash 
baby.

2851
02:04:12,150 --> 02:04:17,150
You know?
That's why they're going to drill holes 

2852
02:04:17,150 --> 02:04:17,290
right next to the river.
While the good stuff is flopped.

2853
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:19,640
A salmon,
they just get to get in there.

2854
02:04:19,641 --> 02:04:21,620
It's just start drilling.
They don't give a fuck,

2855
02:04:21,621 --> 02:04:24,170
man.
People were just who just want money.

2856
02:04:24,171 --> 02:04:29,171
Don't give a fuck.
This is what's the problem with guys 

2857
02:04:29,171 --> 02:04:32,561
like trump?
This is what the problem with the guys 

2858
02:04:32,561 --> 02:04:32,561
like.
He brings in.

2859
02:04:32,561 --> 02:04:33,800
There's so many that the number one 
thing is not making money.

2860
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:36,650
The number one thing is sustainability.
That's the number one thing,

2861
02:04:36,651 --> 02:04:37,980
living the earth.
That's the

2862
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,560
number one thing is can we live off this
earth?

2863
02:04:40,590 --> 02:04:41,610
Okay,
good.

2864
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:43,560
Number two things.
We've got to be safe.

2865
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:44,790
Okay,
how can we be safe?

2866
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:45,360
Well,
first of all,

2867
02:04:45,361 --> 02:04:50,361
we need to be able to talk.
So freedom of speech is hugely fucking 

2868
02:04:50,361 --> 02:04:51,000
important.
When it comes to being safe.

2869
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:53,790
You need to be able to say things 
without fear of repercussion.

2870
02:04:54,030 --> 02:04:59,030
You need to be able to communicate 100 
percent honestly amongst each other so 

2871
02:04:59,030 --> 02:05:00,990
we could figure out how you really feel.
Tell me how you really feel about this.

2872
02:05:00,991 --> 02:05:05,991
Then I can understand you.
I don't really understand you yet 

2873
02:05:05,991 --> 02:05:06,290
because you're hiding how you really 
feel about partial,

2874
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:07,980
about life,
parts of life.

2875
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:10,530
That's where freedom of speech is,
so God damn important.

2876
02:05:10,531 --> 02:05:13,800
Just one aspect of it being important,
being able to protest about stuff,

2877
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:16,170
all that shit.
You have to pee.

2878
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:17,030
So.
No,

2879
02:05:17,070 --> 02:05:20,040
no,
we just did that.

2880
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:23,170
So they just did that the other day and 
handed me a note to.

2881
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:25,430
How long have we gone?
Oh,

2882
02:05:25,530 --> 02:05:27,300
it was pat miletich.
Uh,

2883
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:28,980
it's 1:30.
What did we start at?

2884
02:05:28,981 --> 02:05:31,830
Like 1115.
So you do the math.

2885
02:05:31,831 --> 02:05:33,690
I'm too stupid for that already.

2886
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:39,420
That's why we're talking about.
That's why you eat the food.

2887
02:05:39,421 --> 02:05:42,300
That you shouldn't be the same reason 
that you got that.

2888
02:05:42,301 --> 02:05:45,080
Fuck it gene.
Fuck it.

2889
02:05:45,210 --> 02:05:47,100
I have to midnight.
Is Jazz hard?

2890
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:48,630
Oh,
I do it sometimes.

2891
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:51,960
I came home the other day from the ice 
house Saturday night.

2892
02:05:51,961 --> 02:05:56,961
I cooked a steak at one in the morning.
I got the cast iron skillet out and I 

2893
02:05:56,961 --> 02:06:01,460
put some butter down and I had steak and
Kimchi while I watch TV at 1:00

2894
02:06:04,171 --> 02:06:05,160
in the morning.
Whatever the fuck.

2895
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:05,940
It was.
Delicious.

2896
02:06:06,150 --> 02:06:07,800
Amazing.
It was amazing.

2897
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:10,830
I'm lucky that I.
The reason I want to stop,

2898
02:06:10,831 --> 02:06:14,820
it's not because I get sick.
I really have an iron stomach if there's

2899
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:16,800
such as good,
but it's just,

2900
02:06:16,801 --> 02:06:17,420
I,
you know,

2901
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:20,130
it still makes me feel a little bit like
I don't get sick,

2902
02:06:20,131 --> 02:06:21,810
but I feel a little heavy in the 
morning.

2903
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:26,840
Dude,
I took two whole days yesterday and the 

2904
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:30,330
day before,
or a bullshit yesterday I egg rolls.

2905
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:34,650
The day before I had a big bowl of pasta
and I had a cupcake.

2906
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:36,480
I just decided,
fuck it.

2907
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:39,480
It Sunday or Monday,
whatever it was,

2908
02:06:39,510 --> 02:06:41,460
Sunday and Monday let's just have some 
fun.

2909
02:06:41,461 --> 02:06:43,860
So for two days I was eight.
Whatever the fuck I want.

2910
02:06:43,861 --> 02:06:48,861
I just decided I want to do that.
I had the worst parts of my career.

2911
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:53,100
I mean,
of my career of farting.

2912
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:57,120
These were,
these were the bombs to end all bombs.

2913
02:06:57,240 --> 02:07:00,150
My Body's just not designed to do that 
anymore.

2914
02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:05,330
It just doesn't want to do that anymore 
because I've been eating so clean so 

2915
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:08,541
regularly that just a couple of days of 
pasta and bullshit and egg rolls and my 

2916
02:07:10,141 --> 02:07:12,090
body was like,
fuck you.

2917
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:15,000
I felt lethargic.
I was like,

2918
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:18,810
I just want to sit down all the time.
My workout sucked.

2919
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:20,520
It was hard to push myself.
I was like,

2920
02:07:20,521 --> 02:07:23,130
wow.
Like this is not good.

2921
02:07:23,131 --> 02:07:26,340
Like eating bullshit.
Just this is what most people are doing.

2922
02:07:26,341 --> 02:07:31,341
Most people are doing all day.
They're eating candy bars and bullshit 

2923
02:07:31,341 --> 02:07:34,350
and not getting any nutrients.
You mean candy bars?

2924
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:36,010
Well,
here's what

2925
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,440
I mean.
I'll,

2926
02:07:36,441 --> 02:07:37,060
I'll,
uh,

2927
02:07:37,570 --> 02:07:40,450
eight very bad.
Why you should eat good.

2928
02:07:42,690 --> 02:07:43,850
Got It.
Why don't you,

2929
02:07:43,851 --> 02:07:48,851
uh,
why don't you approach it like you're 

2930
02:07:48,851 --> 02:07:51,200
taking in the artwork of these people 
who cook food for you or learn how to 

2931
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:51,200
cook yourself.

2932
02:07:51,270 --> 02:07:52,410
I cares.
The problem.

2933
02:07:52,470 --> 02:07:57,470
Oh,
is that I had during the day I eat 

2934
02:07:57,470 --> 02:07:59,280
great.
I juice every day like Kale,

2935
02:07:59,281 --> 02:08:00,210
carrots,
celery,

2936
02:08:00,211 --> 02:08:03,180
ginger beets every single day.
So you don't eat healthy?

2937
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:03,540
Well,
no,

2938
02:08:03,541 --> 02:08:05,670
that's just because my only thing I 
could do to say,

2939
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:07,890
okay,
well I have the shitty diet.

2940
02:08:07,891 --> 02:08:12,891
I can at least say to my body,
I like to think of myself as my body 

2941
02:08:12,891 --> 02:08:13,140
going.
Thank you for giving us some good stuff.

2942
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:14,760
We wish you wouldn't eat that other 
shit,

2943
02:08:14,970 --> 02:08:17,100
but thanks for something that's everyday
I'd use,

2944
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:20,550
but then it gets bad late at night.
I mean if it's.

2945
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:21,900
But that's good though.

2946
02:08:22,100 --> 02:08:24,800
So you're not all bad.
You have a lot of good habits.

2947
02:08:24,801 --> 02:08:29,801
Like you're very aware that you need 
nutrients when you do do that stuff and 

2948
02:08:29,801 --> 02:08:33,671
juice.
One of the things that they say we 

2949
02:08:33,671 --> 02:08:36,251
should probably look this up right now 
because I'm obviously not a nutrition 

2950
02:08:36,251 --> 02:08:38,621
expert,
but I'm pretty sure they say that 

2951
02:08:38,621 --> 02:08:39,460
vitamins are absorbed better.
Um,

2952
02:08:39,470 --> 02:08:41,330
when you have them with some healthy 
fat.

2953
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:46,750
So I think they recommend coconut oil.
Have you have some coconut oil with 

2954
02:08:47,090 --> 02:08:49,040
vegetables?
When you drink vegetable juice,

2955
02:08:49,050 --> 02:08:51,840
it actually can enhance the absorption 
of some of the vitamins.

2956
02:08:51,841 --> 02:08:52,570
It's good to know.
Yeah.

2957
02:08:52,630 --> 02:08:55,850
So some people will mix it in or mix mct
oil,

2958
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:59,600
medium chain triglyceride oil,
fat soluble vitamins.

2959
02:08:59,601 --> 02:09:02,060
You won't get enough vitamin D from 
drinking vegetable juice.

2960
02:09:02,061 --> 02:09:04,850
It's found mainly in fatty cheese,
fatty fish,

2961
02:09:04,851 --> 02:09:05,840
cheese,
mushrooms,

2962
02:09:05,841 --> 02:09:08,210
egg yolks,
beef liver and fortified foods.

2963
02:09:08,211 --> 02:09:09,620
You need vitamin D,
that's A.

2964
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:11,210
Yeah,
that's.

2965
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:16,540
They're saying this.
They're just saying that vitamin D is 

2966
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:16,590
very difficult to get if you're a Vegan.
Right.

2967
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:19,450
I do eat food too,
but I like some.

2968
02:09:19,451 --> 02:09:24,010
The thing is at night I'm so hungry,
so I'll go to the Vaughn's.

2969
02:09:24,011 --> 02:09:24,760
I'll be like,
well listen,

2970
02:09:24,761 --> 02:09:28,540
I'm going to want candy no matter what.
And I had dinner at like 5:30.

2971
02:09:28,541 --> 02:09:33,541
This is like now nine,
so I don't really need dinner and eat 

2972
02:09:33,541 --> 02:09:33,541
dinner.
So I'd go,

2973
02:09:33,541 --> 02:09:33,910
well I,
I'm going to get dinner.

2974
02:09:33,911 --> 02:09:37,210
I'm Roland Candi is second dinner,
whatever you wanna call second street.

2975
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:41,140
So I go,
I know this is bad,

2976
02:09:41,141 --> 02:09:43,180
but the last few weeks I'll be there and
I'll be like,

2977
02:09:43,181 --> 02:09:44,510
you know what?
I'm going to eat.

2978
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:46,540
I'm on candy.
I'll just get candy.

2979
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:49,840
And then I'm proud of myself because I 
didn't like it.

2980
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:53,350
He didn't need food and candy.
Get Food or candy and when I get Candy I

2981
02:09:53,351 --> 02:09:58,351
get candy.
It's not like I'm getting like a jumbo 

2982
02:09:58,351 --> 02:09:58,351
snickers bar.

2983
02:09:58,351 --> 02:10:01,200
What are you doing?
I told someone that helps out at the 

2984
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:01,200
podcast when they're at the vons to get 
me a candy bar.

2985
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:03,130
They brought me back a candy bar.
It little.

2986
02:10:03,131 --> 02:10:04,160
I'm like,
are you shit?

2987
02:10:04,610 --> 02:10:05,020
What?
Oh,

2988
02:10:05,050 --> 02:10:06,070
reese's cups.
I said,

2989
02:10:06,170 --> 02:10:11,170
I get some reese's cups.
They brought back to reese's cups in a 

2990
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:11,170
pack.
Oh,

2991
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:11,170
little ones.
Yeah.

2992
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:11,860
I go,
when I say reese's cups,

2993
02:10:11,861 --> 02:10:15,250
I mean a bag.
The guy had this fantasy.

2994
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:18,820
Now the fantasy that I had a reading 
reads cups nonstop for five,

2995
02:10:18,821 --> 02:10:23,170
10 minutes because now have gone love,
love reese's cups.

2996
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:26,710
Do you like to do the double a?
The big ones that the.

2997
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:27,310
The,
the,

2998
02:10:27,390 --> 02:10:30,490
the big thick ones and I like to have 
them with ice cream.

2999
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:33,860
I've done that many times.
All kinds of ice cream.

3000
02:10:33,890 --> 02:10:34,310
Chocolate

3001
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:35,300
ice cream.
Fuck it.

3002
02:10:35,301 --> 02:10:37,400
I'll have it with strawberry.
I don't give a shit.

3003
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:39,730
You know?
What would we say no to?

3004
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:44,240
I know what I would rather have you take
a double reese's cup,

3005
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:49,420
put it in the microwave for literally 10
seconds and then get the vanilla ice 

3006
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:51,260
cream and just smash it on top.
It's absurd.

3007
02:10:51,290 --> 02:10:54,770
Absurd to something about ice cream and 
some cakes,

3008
02:10:54,771 --> 02:10:57,500
like a warm apple pie with vanilla ice 
cream.

3009
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:00,380
Woo.
Holy Shit.

3010
02:11:00,381 --> 02:11:03,740
Chocolate cake.
With a with vanilla ice cream.

3011
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:08,800
Oh my goodness.
I could warm chocolate cake and vanilla 

3012
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:08,800
ice cream.
Oh,

3013
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:12,890
apple pie though with cinnamon and 
vanilla ice cream.

3014
02:11:12,891 --> 02:11:14,750
Holy Shit.
Todd glass.

3015
02:11:14,751 --> 02:11:17,240
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

3016
02:11:17,241 --> 02:11:20,570
That's good.
The French French apple pie with vanilla

3017
02:11:20,571 --> 02:11:23,510
ice cream because you get the apple pie 
is American motherfucker.

3018
02:11:23,511 --> 02:11:25,430
I don't know where he get this French 
shit from.

3019
02:11:26,980 --> 02:11:30,700
Here's how do they even have apples in 
France?

3020
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:34,100
Speaking of Apple Pie.
Mcdonald's should do this.

3021
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:36,320
Take your glass.
Clear glass that you can see,

3022
02:11:36,321 --> 02:11:37,020
right?
Right.

3023
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:38,840
They picture the commercial.
They'll shoot it,

3024
02:11:38,841 --> 02:11:43,841
right?
Then put the apple pie in their apple 

3025
02:11:43,841 --> 02:11:46,781
pint and glass and then fill it with 
vanilla ice cream and put some caramel 

3026
02:11:46,781 --> 02:11:46,781
sauce and go.
You call it their apple pie.

3027
02:11:46,781 --> 02:11:50,000
Allah mode and it put a spoon and you 
get the Apple Pie.

3028
02:11:50,001 --> 02:11:51,320
The Vanilla ice cream.
A little bit,

3029
02:11:51,321 --> 02:11:56,120
little bit of sauce at the top to.
You should this on the show.

3030
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:59,150
You should go to them with a proposal 
that todd glass.

3031
02:11:59,630 --> 02:12:02,240
Apple Pie.
It's a great idea mode and they have all

3032
02:12:02,241 --> 02:12:04,940
this stuff there to need a spokesperson.
The commercial,

3033
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:08,600
this is my idea,
I was just do it that way.

3034
02:12:09,310 --> 02:12:12,020
We get the public on the side.
There's the apple pie in the ice cream,

3035
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:14,460
so some of the tops I was dig in.

3036
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:16,700
It's apple pie,
a la mode.

3037
02:12:16,850 --> 02:12:21,850
It's a great idea.
Especially if you could figure out how 

3038
02:12:21,850 --> 02:12:22,670
to nuke only the apple pie.
Well,

3039
02:12:22,671 --> 02:12:27,671
they could,
so they have to put it together is 

3040
02:12:27,671 --> 02:12:27,671
already hot.
It's in.

3041
02:12:27,671 --> 02:12:29,000
They drop it in.
They dropped the ice cream on top.

3042
02:12:29,001 --> 02:12:30,710
The ice cream on top.
That's genius.

3043
02:12:31,140 --> 02:12:33,020
Takes a couple seconds to make.
Right?

3044
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:34,940
You don't just grab it.
You gotta to drop one in there.

3045
02:12:34,970 --> 02:12:37,970
It's very easy to Bang Bang there.
Yeah,

3046
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:40,490
right.
That's a great idea.

3047
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:45,580
That's a really good.
That's the best idea I've ever heard on 

3048
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:45,580
this podcast.
Thank you.

3049
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:45,580
Oh,
they have it.

3050
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:49,820
This isn't Mcdonald's restaurant that 
made this exact dessert the way you're 

3051
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:53,250
describing it in a glass exact same.
The idea is that.

3052
02:12:53,290 --> 02:12:58,290
No,
but I'm saying it's that they have all 

3053
02:12:58,290 --> 02:12:59,951
the ingredients to do it.
They have those glasses they have apple 

3054
02:12:59,951 --> 02:12:59,951
pie with.

3055
02:12:59,951 --> 02:13:03,370
They should just serve it because I bet 
it would be a big seller because it 

3056
02:13:03,370 --> 02:13:03,370
does.
Apple pies are not bad either.

3057
02:13:03,370 --> 02:13:05,160
Those Mcdonald's advertise when you want
one.

3058
02:13:05,370 --> 02:13:07,640
Those are not bad to know.
What's that?

3059
02:13:07,670 --> 02:13:08,840
Two for a dollar?
Is that what they are?

3060
02:13:08,841 --> 02:13:09,500
Yeah.
Wow.

3061
02:13:09,501 --> 02:13:11,090
That's pretty good.
Here's my bed.

3062
02:13:11,630 --> 02:13:12,860
I called junk.
It's junk.

3063
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,530
It's food for this junk but not candy 
junk food,

3064
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:21,310
so I like to get the biggest Mcdonald's 
hamburger there is like whatever it is 

3065
02:13:21,310 --> 02:13:21,380
that I can get into menu.
I look okay.

3066
02:13:21,381 --> 02:13:23,750
Can I get that with nothing on it?
Just a plain burger.

3067
02:13:23,751 --> 02:13:24,560
No cheese,
no nothing.

3068
02:13:25,010 --> 02:13:28,130
Then I get an egg mcmuffin.
You can either do two things.

3069
02:13:28,131 --> 02:13:33,131
One,
you could take all the ingredients off 

3070
02:13:33,131 --> 02:13:35,350
the egg mcmuffin and put it in the 
hamburger so you have a hamburger with 

3071
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:36,390
an egg,
a piece of ham knees and it's so good.

3072
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:39,630
Or take the Hamburg or put it in,
let the egg mcmuffin be the bread,

3073
02:13:40,410 --> 02:13:43,200
but it's pretty good.
That sounds pretty God damn good.

3074
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:45,750
That sounds like you're doing.
You're doing God's work.

3075
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:48,090
Figuring out some stuff that they can't 
figure it out.

3076
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:49,860
They've figured out some impressive 
things.

3077
02:13:49,861 --> 02:13:52,230
They figured out how to make a fucking 
juicy,

3078
02:13:52,231 --> 02:13:57,231
delicious pancake.
That's the top of a of a mcmuffin.

3079
02:13:58,110 --> 02:14:02,100
Those mcgriddles that is my aunt,
one of my all time favorite cheat foods.

3080
02:14:02,350 --> 02:14:05,790
A goddammit griddle.
They'll fucking delicious.

3081
02:14:05,791 --> 02:14:09,990
You want to talk about like the good 
feeling in your mouth for a buck?

3082
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:12,840
Like how much?
Like how much bang you get for your buck

3083
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:15,180
if you're hungry with the cheese and the
AG.

3084
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:16,710
Holy Shit.
Here's my point.

3085
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,520
How much I agree with,
you know,

3086
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:19,980
we're not saying the ingredients or 
anything.

3087
02:14:20,130 --> 02:14:23,250
If you took that mcgriddle yeah.
I say this with a lot of foods.

3088
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:25,870
I'm just using this as an example 
because you just said this,

3089
02:14:25,871 --> 02:14:28,590
that actual item,
but I say this with a lot of things.

3090
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:30,660
Put It on it.
You take that mcgriddle,

3091
02:14:30,661 --> 02:14:33,850
put it on a chopping block at a French 
restaurant in whatever,

3092
02:14:33,980 --> 02:14:37,020
and then all you do is put that 
mcgriddle on the chopping block and then

3093
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:39,810
maybe put some syrup all over it,
delivered to a table there.

3094
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:41,970
No one's going to go.
It's good,

3095
02:14:41,971 --> 02:14:45,870
but it's not like it's going to go.
Shut the fuck up.

3096
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:50,950
Yeah.
You know what I say that about Papa 

3097
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:54,070
John's a cinnamon things they do.
You know where they take the bread they 

3098
02:14:54,070 --> 02:14:54,070
put.
It's not only they put butter on it,

3099
02:14:54,070 --> 02:14:56,400
but then the vanilla glaze all over it.
They put it in the oven.

3100
02:14:56,520 --> 02:14:59,820
If you were anywhere they go hold about 
six in the morning.

3101
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:03,240
It that they put the fresh cinnamon 
tarts out,

3102
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:08,330
you know,
and then you took a papa John's put it 

3103
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:08,330
on.

3104
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:08,400
No one would eat it and go though.
It's good.

3105
02:15:08,401 --> 02:15:09,750
It's sugary.
It's doing the job there.

3106
02:15:09,751 --> 02:15:10,560
They'd go.
What?

3107
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:13,830
What if you had a mcgriddle with ice 
cream on it?

3108
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:17,940
Wow.
Ice Cream in between.

3109
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:23,740
Like in between the layers.
You put the mcgriddle down with the 

3110
02:15:23,740 --> 02:15:24,110
sausage.
It'd be absurd to be fucking sausage.

3111
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:25,950
Oh,
I didn't think of the sausage,

3112
02:15:26,540 --> 02:15:29,730
so I just thought the bread and the 
Syrup and style,

3113
02:15:29,731 --> 02:15:33,380
the whole sausage.
Let's see.

3114
02:15:34,530 --> 02:15:37,200
Let's see.
You could definitely do it.

3115
02:15:37,250 --> 02:15:39,750
I,
I've always loved Hawaiian Pizza,

3116
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:42,120
the pineapple and ham together.
Me To people.

3117
02:15:42,121 --> 02:15:47,121
Some people,
you know what I'll argue social issues 

3118
02:15:47,121 --> 02:15:47,970
into d for free because I think there's 
a good side of it,

3119
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:50,130
but some people I'm okay to let go and 
people go,

3120
02:15:50,370 --> 02:15:52,620
I can't believe someone would like 
pineapple on pizza.

3121
02:15:52,690 --> 02:15:54,090
Okay.
Right.

3122
02:15:54,170 --> 02:15:56,230
I'm not.
I can't believe you like to pick sees.

3123
02:15:57,090 --> 02:16:01,530
Jesus says,
okay,

3124
02:16:01,650 --> 02:16:04,050
you know what I really love.
I'm a pineapple.

3125
02:16:04,110 --> 02:16:09,110
Pineapple and anchovy.
I know it sounds disgusting.

3126
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:12,840
It tastes amazing.
It's one of my all time favorite pizzas.

3127
02:16:12,841 --> 02:16:16,980
It might be my all time.
Mine's pineapple and slice sausage.

3128
02:16:17,010 --> 02:16:18,930
What are you watching this?
This is a,

3129
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:23,070
a mcgriddle being rolled into rolled ice
cream.

3130
02:16:23,071 --> 02:16:24,900
Things that's popular right now.
Oh,

3131
02:16:24,901 --> 02:16:29,901
it's almost what you just described but 
not quite and it looks actually Kinda 

3132
02:16:29,901 --> 02:16:30,090
froze it and

3133
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,800
then turned it into those things.
Yeah.

3134
02:16:31,810 --> 02:16:34,960
You're seeing those.
The chopped it up and flattened it out.

3135
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:38,500
It's like barely food.
So it's barely food.

3136
02:16:38,501 --> 02:16:41,070
That's so weird.
What is the top?

3137
02:16:41,580 --> 02:16:44,950
So it's the not the inside of the 
mcgriddle.

3138
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:50,200
It's just the analysis starts over here 
again and they turned it into this 

3139
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:50,200
thing.
Donald's do it.

3140
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:50,230
Yeah.
Well,

3141
02:16:50,231 --> 02:16:53,440
that makes sense if it's the inside of 
the mcgriddle because it's all,

3142
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:55,840
I mean the outside rather because it's 
all just that doe he shit.

3143
02:16:55,841 --> 02:16:56,830
Anyway,
I was.

3144
02:16:56,831 --> 02:16:58,240
They poured the batter on it and then 
show.

3145
02:16:58,270 --> 02:16:59,230
Oh,
it is everything.

3146
02:16:59,650 --> 02:17:00,760
It's the meat to.
Oh,

3147
02:17:00,761 --> 02:17:04,570
that's crazy.
How weird might be good,

3148
02:17:04,571 --> 02:17:06,130
but I don't know.
It might be good.

3149
02:17:06,170 --> 02:17:07,330
Yeah.
Look,

3150
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:09,640
it's probably an interesting way to eat.
I mean,

3151
02:17:09,641 --> 02:17:12,160
it's no different than what you're doing
when you're masticating it.

3152
02:17:14,690 --> 02:17:16,510
It's what you're doing.
You're making that out of it.

3153
02:17:16,511 --> 02:17:18,350
It's just making that already.
Just.

3154
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:23,520
Maybe you don't want to see it.
I found out this past week that ground 

3155
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:25,981
beef was invented by the Mongols ground 
meat and went to see the con exhibit at 

3156
02:17:26,111 --> 02:17:30,490
the Reagan Library.
Fuck living back then.

3157
02:17:30,491 --> 02:17:35,491
Dude.
You think it'd be hard to start over as 

3158
02:17:35,491 --> 02:17:36,520
an open mic comic mentioned starting off
in a Mongo camp.

3159
02:17:36,550 --> 02:17:38,110
Wait,
why was ground beef invented?

3160
02:17:38,140 --> 02:17:43,140
They invented ground beef.
Apparently Mongols invented the Mongol 

3161
02:17:43,140 --> 02:17:44,200
Empire.
Is either indirectly responsible,

3162
02:17:44,201 --> 02:17:49,201
directly responsible,
or they invented like a shitload of 

3163
02:17:49,201 --> 02:17:49,201
things.
Would that be.

3164
02:17:49,201 --> 02:17:52,040
What year would it be?
That was like the 12 hundreds that they,

3165
02:17:52,450 --> 02:17:55,210
that they existed,
that they first came to be.

3166
02:17:55,310 --> 02:17:57,430
What were they before that?
They just ate steak.

3167
02:17:57,630 --> 02:17:58,390
No,
but I mean,

3168
02:17:58,391 --> 02:17:59,290
look,
they all,

3169
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:01,240
whatever.
I think they probably just,

3170
02:18:01,241 --> 02:18:06,241
yeah,
they just probably looked cooked meat 

3171
02:18:06,241 --> 02:18:08,010
and just ate the meat and then someone 
figured out where you can take tough 

3172
02:18:08,010 --> 02:18:09,910
cuts because they would eat whatever the
fuck they could take.

3173
02:18:10,050 --> 02:18:12,490
Tough cut and grind it up.
You can cook it and eat it.

3174
02:18:12,491 --> 02:18:14,790
Easier to figure that out.
You don't eat meat?

3175
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:16,240
I eat a lot of me.
Oh,

3176
02:18:16,241 --> 02:18:17,010
you do?
Yeah.

3177
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:18,610
Why I you think I wouldn't eat meat?
I don't know.

3178
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:22,270
You know,
it may be for you.

3179
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:23,060
One of those guys.
Well,

3180
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:23,380
no,
no,

3181
02:18:23,381 --> 02:18:23,790
no.
I,

3182
02:18:23,791 --> 02:18:26,810
I would say a free.
I would just say I,

3183
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:31,210
I listened to all always open to listen 
to new things to sway my opinion,

3184
02:18:31,211 --> 02:18:35,680
but I like the stance of I heard someone
talking about at least free,

3185
02:18:35,990 --> 02:18:40,990
free free range.
Now I know the opposing view on that 

3186
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:40,990
too.
But,

3187
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:40,990
uh,
I just thought,

3188
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:40,990
you know,
if you're,

3189
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:43,510
if you're thinking I get it,
that there is a food chain,

3190
02:18:43,570 --> 02:18:45,070
this is what I heard this person 
speaking.

3191
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:46,820
I'm not saying it,
but I made.

3192
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:47,980
It's made sense to me.

3193
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:53,180
No,
there is a food chain and we don't have 

3194
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:53,180
to torture animals of course,
but there is this,

3195
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:57,390
but you know,
and tortured animals that then I would 

3196
02:18:57,390 --> 02:18:57,390
be like,
if I was going to,

3197
02:18:57,390 --> 02:18:58,240
I wish I could,
if I was going to eat meat,

3198
02:18:58,270 --> 02:19:00,760
I do eat meat,
but I wish I did it that way.

3199
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:03,760
I'd be proud of myself if I committed.
When I hear someone that does that,

3200
02:19:04,210 --> 02:19:05,200
that will.
I'm like,

3201
02:19:05,230 --> 02:19:07,780
Oh,
I have admiration for that.

3202
02:19:08,170 --> 02:19:11,380
Would you ever consider killing an 
animal that you were going to eat?

3203
02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:15,070
Would you ever consider like raising a 
cow killing it?

3204
02:19:15,170 --> 02:19:17,050
I couldn't,
but I don't.

3205
02:19:17,380 --> 02:19:19,120
What about hunting?
Do you think you could hunt?

3206
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:20,410
No.
No?

3207
02:19:21,550 --> 02:19:23,170
No.
Could you?

3208
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:24,220
Oh,
you do?

3209
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:25,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

3210
02:19:25,091 --> 02:19:25,930
But I don't.
I'm not,

3211
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:28,160
I'm not.
I just

3212
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,020
couldn't hunt.
I'm not proper.

3213
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:32,630
I don't want it.
It's not something you're interested in.

3214
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:34,220
I beat you.
Listen,

3215
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:37,040
there's nothing wrong with that.
It's a,

3216
02:19:37,630 --> 02:19:41,990
it's like I shot a guy in the face once 
at camp who shot a man in Reno.

3217
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:45,380
I shot.
Remember when he's singing that song?

3218
02:19:45,381 --> 02:19:50,381
He was in prison,
which I've liked that he went back and 

3219
02:19:50,381 --> 02:19:50,381
perform there,
that they can,

3220
02:19:50,381 --> 02:19:50,730
they're not,
they don't have to be lost.

3221
02:19:52,110 --> 02:19:53,040
And then he,
uh,

3222
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:58,270
and he goes,
I shot a man in Reno just to watch him 

3223
02:19:58,270 --> 02:19:58,270
die.
And they'll go,

3224
02:19:58,270 --> 02:19:58,580
well,
let's not glorify.

3225
02:19:58,581 --> 02:20:01,700
The guys said.
They like,

3226
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:04,140
listen,
I'm not trying to.

3227
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:05,660
I did doubt about it.
Yeah,

3228
02:20:05,690 --> 02:20:08,240
I'm bummed.
I'm singing it.

3229
02:20:08,241 --> 02:20:13,241
It's not good.
Don't someone just do a standup special 

3230
02:20:13,241 --> 02:20:13,241
inside of prison?
Jeff Ross.

3231
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:17,120
Jeff Ross was another comic to a black 
comic.

3232
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:21,180
You know the Alley Siddique John.
Very worried.

3233
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:22,370
Is that it?
Yeah.

3234
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:24,020
How do you say?
Is that how you say his name?

3235
02:20:25,450 --> 02:20:27,260
Paul.
Wow.

3236
02:20:27,650 --> 02:20:30,110
I like the background you have behind 
you more than the background,

3237
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:35,240
but I got a,
what's it called?

3238
02:20:38,630 --> 02:20:41,840
I think it's bigger than these bars.
Oh,

3239
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:43,470
nice.
You gotta use the bathroom.

3240
02:20:43,490 --> 02:20:44,710
Go ahead.
Don't worry about it.

3241
02:20:44,870 --> 02:20:46,080
You're not going to say anything right 
now.

3242
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:47,580
We could wrap this up too.
I mean,

3243
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:52,590
we've already asked you about this.
Why you go to the bathroom if that's 

3244
02:20:52,590 --> 02:20:53,240
okay.
I'm just Mongol eating meat thing.

3245
02:20:53,241 --> 02:20:55,100
I just pull up this article from the New
York Times.

3246
02:20:55,101 --> 02:21:00,101
It said that horse meat being tenderized
under their saddle is a myth.

3247
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:02,530
I don't know if that.
Yeah.

3248
02:21:02,610 --> 02:21:02,920
Yeah.

3249
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:09,270
Tenderize under their saddle steak.
Tar Tar was horse meat dish that 

3250
02:21:09,270 --> 02:21:13,411
originated from the horse eat Mongols,
the central Asia who swept across the 

3251
02:21:13,411 --> 02:21:17,011
eastern Central Europe 800 years ago.
The most common tales that the tartar 

3252
02:21:17,180 --> 02:21:18,720
that tater.
How do you.

3253
02:21:18,730 --> 02:21:23,730
What would you say that tater tot her 
ear horseman would put a slice of 

3254
02:21:23,730 --> 02:21:28,531
horsemeat beneath their saddle in the 
morning and retrieve it tenderized by 

3255
02:21:28,531 --> 02:21:29,140
the pounding.
Teat Ra for dinner.

3256
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:33,280
They supposedly left their raw meat 
eating habit behind and according to one

3257
02:21:33,281 --> 02:21:38,281
version of the story,
it was carried by the German sailors to 

3258
02:21:38,281 --> 02:21:41,491
Homburg or the taste for ground beef 
began begat both hamburgers and steak 

3259
02:21:41,831 --> 02:21:44,080
tartare.
That's interesting.

3260
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:48,260
Is that where Neil hamburger is that 
where a hamburger came from.

3261
02:21:48,450 --> 02:21:51,980
The guy that goes hamburger,
I'm just to use the bathroom.

3262
02:21:51,981 --> 02:21:53,240
What's cool is that.
Okay,

3263
02:21:53,570 --> 02:21:58,570
cool.
I wanted to ask about that because 

3264
02:21:58,570 --> 02:22:00,371
that's interesting.
I wonder if the Reagan Library has old 

3265
02:22:00,371 --> 02:22:03,701
information in their exhibit.
It says it's been passed around as a 

3266
02:22:03,701 --> 02:22:07,590
like to say that if you're running a 
museum you should probably know that 

3267
02:22:08,061 --> 02:22:13,061
that's not true unless they.
They figured out chopped meat and this 

3268
02:22:13,061 --> 02:22:13,690
is not the same thing.
Maybe it's not.

3269
02:22:13,790 --> 02:22:18,790
Maybe originally it was,
but I would feel like if someone wanted 

3270
02:22:18,790 --> 02:22:23,021
to do that,
that would be a way to tenderize meat 

3271
02:22:23,021 --> 02:22:26,390
now.
I mean I went to the same restaurant I 

3272
02:22:26,390 --> 02:22:26,390
was describing that I worked at before 
was a Mongolian

3273
02:22:26,390 --> 02:22:28,440
barbecue grill where we'd cook with 
swords,

3274
02:22:28,441 --> 02:22:30,670
literal metal swords on a flat top,
but no,

3275
02:22:30,671 --> 02:22:35,671
it was supposed to be representing the 
shields that the Mongols would cook on 

3276
02:22:35,671 --> 02:22:35,940
back in the 800,
whatever,

3277
02:22:35,941 --> 02:22:38,250
and they were just shredding meat.
That's the only way you could do it.

3278
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:40,800
So they were shredding beef.
I don't know if it's ground,

3279
02:22:40,801 --> 02:22:43,250
but like definitely shredded.
So it's always something

3280
02:22:43,410 --> 02:22:47,640
when we cooked in the field with Rinella
for the first time,

3281
02:22:47,641 --> 02:22:52,641
when we shot a deer,
he pounded it flat like he took like a 

3282
02:22:52,641 --> 02:22:55,020
chunk of the backstrap and then put it 
in between.

3283
02:22:55,050 --> 02:22:59,190
I forget what he put it in between,
but pounded it flat before it cooked it,

3284
02:22:59,191 --> 02:23:01,500
like to tenderize it and break it down a
little bit.

3285
02:23:02,250 --> 02:23:07,250
I just watched a video of a guy pounding
and aluminum foil role and making a 

3286
02:23:07,250 --> 02:23:08,610
knife out of it is fucking bad ass.
Like a knife,

3287
02:23:08,611 --> 02:23:11,870
like a Shiv or a shank.
Watching it go watch the.

3288
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:13,530
I know you like to watch knife making 
things.

3289
02:23:13,780 --> 02:23:18,780
It's just like it.
It's 10 minute video of him literally 

3290
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:18,780
taking the whole role.

3291
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:19,120
Pull it up.
I want to see that.

3292
02:23:19,250 --> 02:23:24,250
That's crazy.
Some dude made a knife out of an 

3293
02:23:24,250 --> 02:23:27,190
aluminum foil role.
That's when you really want to fuck 

3294
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:29,180
somebody up,
but you're trapped in a restaurant.

3295
02:23:29,210 --> 02:23:30,080
Hey,
I have a question.

3296
02:23:30,110 --> 02:23:31,910
Go ahead.
We probably.

3297
02:23:31,911 --> 02:23:35,450
Should we go for the close?
Look at this.

3298
02:23:35,870 --> 02:23:37,490
Look at this guy.
He's gonna.

3299
02:23:38,030 --> 02:23:40,240
Hammer down this aluminum foil until 
they could turn it.

3300
02:23:40,310 --> 02:23:42,580
Got It all I can to kitchen too.
He just uses the.

3301
02:23:42,581 --> 02:23:45,590
A regular old stove gas stove.

3302
02:23:45,970 --> 02:23:48,040
So did you just hammer it down and then 
fold it?

3303
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:49,570
Is that what he did?
He leaves it here.

3304
02:23:49,571 --> 02:23:54,571
I was just kind of skip ahead so you can
just get a good idea for bad unless you 

3305
02:23:54,571 --> 02:23:55,510
were trying to use that to build your 
kids afford.

3306
02:23:55,511 --> 02:23:57,850
Then you're a nice person.
You bake a hammer.

3307
02:23:57,960 --> 02:24:02,960
Oh,
we turned it into metal that you could 

3308
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:02,960
saw.
This is crazy.

3309
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:06,640
Been a lot of time sharpening it down.
This is crazy.

3310
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:08,540
Whoa.
This is not.

3311
02:24:08,541 --> 02:24:10,910
So he turned it into a real piece of 
aluminum.

3312
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:15,700
Oh yeah.
That is fucking bananas.

3313
02:24:15,701 --> 02:24:18,520
And he's sharpened.
It is crazy.

3314
02:24:19,290 --> 02:24:22,810
But I gave it a handle.
Oh my God.

3315
02:24:22,990 --> 02:24:27,990
And then put it in at the end and puts 
it in a package and shows like chopping 

3316
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:27,990
stuff.
But domain.

3317
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:30,430
You must be so weak though.
I mean it's aluminum.

3318
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:31,510
Oh,
he sells it.

3319
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:33,520
It probably might.
Would you want to buy?

3320
02:24:33,530 --> 02:24:35,920
Why would you want it?
Just because I'm an asshole.

3321
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:39,100
I want to buy an aluminum foil knife.
I need it.

3322
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:43,540
Every time people come over to the 
house,

3323
02:24:43,541 --> 02:24:46,360
you go,
this knife is made out of aluminum foil.

3324
02:24:46,361 --> 02:24:51,361
I have a video we want you to watch.
He made a knife out of pasta just 

3325
02:24:51,361 --> 02:24:52,060
showing that makes it.
Oh,

3326
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:57,140
that's great.
About the story that Chris Ryan told 

3327
02:24:57,140 --> 02:24:59,101
about the guy who made a knife out of 
shit and it was frozen or frozen shit 

3328
02:24:59,101 --> 02:25:02,590
knife to kill one of his dogs because he
was like a sled dog or.

3329
02:25:02,591 --> 02:25:05,020
And he was starving to death.
Wow.

3330
02:25:05,140 --> 02:25:10,140
Yeah.
Was that true or did he carve his way 

3331
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:12,961
out of an ice hole with a shit shovel?
It's one of those frozen shit shovel.

3332
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:17,380
You're the only guy that comes with 
notes.

3333
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,640
Do you know what?
I only have.

3334
02:25:18,670 --> 02:25:21,490
I wrote.
Can I plug some things for sure.

3335
02:25:21,610 --> 02:25:22,510
Definitely.
Okay,

3336
02:25:22,511 --> 02:25:23,970
so I'll get this real quick about your

3337
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,730
special first.
Where is that?

3338
02:25:26,030 --> 02:25:28,540
Our special netflix.
It's called an act happy.

3339
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:31,150
I wanted to call it sucked by pigeon 
Dick,

3340
02:25:31,151 --> 02:25:33,250
but I was the only one that was raising 
my hand.

3341
02:25:33,251 --> 02:25:34,870
I wish I was there.
I would have backed you up.

3342
02:25:35,050 --> 02:25:36,970
Was was a juggling act,
right,

3343
02:25:36,971 --> 02:25:38,790
and who the hell would it not forgotten.
I know,

3344
02:25:39,180 --> 02:25:41,020
right?
Suck my page and deck.

3345
02:25:41,021 --> 02:25:42,580
That's hilarious.
Can I tell you something?

3346
02:25:42,581 --> 02:25:45,790
The last time I went to two times and I 
know tell any stories like you know,

3347
02:25:45,791 --> 02:25:46,660
oh,
this person.

3348
02:25:46,661 --> 02:25:46,990
No,
no.

3349
02:25:46,991 --> 02:25:51,991
This is two things I think and I think I
would have learned my lesson because my 

3350
02:25:51,991 --> 02:25:55,690
book I wanted to call the.
I wanted to call my book.

3351
02:25:56,350 --> 02:26:01,350
All I ever wanted to do was meet a nice 
girl with a terminal disease and then 

3352
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:05,260
then other stupid things I said to keep 
the closet door shut.

3353
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:07,990
I would add that as a subtitle,
even though I hated the word closet.

3354
02:26:07,991 --> 02:26:12,991
That's how he tried to sell it to him 
because they closet and anything to do 

3355
02:26:12,991 --> 02:26:15,961
with any words,
you know that of Clyde this and out and 

3356
02:26:15,961 --> 02:26:16,480
so I go,
okay,

3357
02:26:16,481 --> 02:26:21,481
if I can call it.
All I ever wanted to do was meet a nice 

3358
02:26:21,481 --> 02:26:21,481
girl.
It was the first title was with cancer.

3359
02:26:21,481 --> 02:26:25,810
All I ever wanted to do was meet a nice 
girl with cancer and other.

3360
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:30,860
The other thing,
other stupid things I said to keep the 

3361
02:26:30,860 --> 02:26:33,061
closet door shut because there's a story
in there about me literally me and my 

3362
02:26:33,061 --> 02:26:33,061
friend,
you know,

3363
02:26:33,061 --> 02:26:36,100
so it does make sense and it's not mean.
It's not insulting cancer.

3364
02:26:36,101 --> 02:26:38,770
I think that's still should have been 
the title of the book.

3365
02:26:38,830 --> 02:26:40,810
The problem is people are going to see 
it and go,

3366
02:26:40,811 --> 02:26:43,600
oh,
he's just a mean guy that wants girls to

3367
02:26:43,601 --> 02:26:48,601
die.
That's the boil down dumb version of 

3368
02:26:48,601 --> 02:26:51,210
fully look into it in that funny you 
didn't even consider that and consider 

3369
02:26:51,210 --> 02:26:53,460
that.
Well,

3370
02:26:53,590 --> 02:26:56,050
you're wishing.
How about terminal disease?

3371
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:57,730
Now you're right.
It brings up a guy,

3372
02:26:57,880 --> 02:26:59,830
a dumb guy writing a book,
Hey,

3373
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:02,020
suck my dick and the Diet.

3374
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:07,870
You know what?
That's how you know what?

3375
02:27:07,871 --> 02:27:12,871
I'm stubborn in certain ways,
but in other ways all you gotta do it 

3376
02:27:12,871 --> 02:27:14,500
cleanly explained something to me.
Oh yeah,

3377
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:16,090
they're right.
I don't want to call it that.

3378
02:27:16,210 --> 02:27:19,420
I never thought about that to go for the
wrong audience,

3379
02:27:19,421 --> 02:27:24,421
to see it on a shelf somewhere and even 
I think we should all be able to change 

3380
02:27:24,421 --> 02:27:26,200
our opinions about things.
I try hard to work on that.

3381
02:27:26,201 --> 02:27:31,201
I do too.
I think it's a big thing about being a 

3382
02:27:31,201 --> 02:27:33,211
person,
be able to look at things and not think 

3383
02:27:33,211 --> 02:27:33,280
that you are those ideas.
You're a person.

3384
02:27:33,490 --> 02:27:35,740
You're not those ideas like you just.
You don't.

3385
02:27:35,741 --> 02:27:40,741
Just because you thought of it and you 
subscribe to it and you believed at one 

3386
02:27:40,741 --> 02:27:41,170
point in time it don't let it define 
you.

3387
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:45,190
It's just an idea and if it's wrong 
beyond just about it and say,

3388
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:49,390
this is why I thought it was real and 
people respect that because they'll know

3389
02:27:49,450 --> 02:27:52,810
that when you're talking you're saying 
what's really on your mind.

3390
02:27:52,810 --> 02:27:54,160
Whether you're a writer,
whether you're wrong,

3391
02:27:54,310 --> 02:27:56,260
you might be incorrect,
but if you are incorrect,

3392
02:27:56,261 --> 02:27:58,510
you going to let them know you're 
incorrect and you know what?

3393
02:27:58,570 --> 02:28:00,160
The way to look at that,
I think,

3394
02:28:00,250 --> 02:28:05,250
and I remind myself every time I talk 
about this stuff to say how many of the 

3395
02:28:05,250 --> 02:28:09,991
things are you doing because they're 
right where you just think time equals 

3396
02:28:09,991 --> 02:28:14,401
validity because there probably are some
things that should you should have been 

3397
02:28:14,401 --> 02:28:15,940
doing for the last 40 years,
but so let's not go issue by issue.

3398
02:28:15,941 --> 02:28:19,090
Here's a wider scope for someone to put 
themselves under fair judgement.

3399
02:28:19,570 --> 02:28:21,740
If you're 45 years old and you haven't 
had.

3400
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:24,410
I'm just throwing out numbers.
I'm okay with up or down the number,

3401
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:25,760
but you'll get the gist of what I'm 
saying.

3402
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:30,920
If you're 45 years old and what?
What are we talking about?

3403
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:32,630
I'm sorry I got high,
but if you remind me I'll.

3404
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:37,690
I'll go right back.
I'm not exactly sure where you're going 

3405
02:28:37,690 --> 02:28:38,700
with it.
Ah,

3406
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:41,520
Shit.
Marijuana is that God damn marijuana.

3407
02:28:41,521 --> 02:28:43,890
I don't even fuck her.
Nothing.

3408
02:28:45,410 --> 02:28:47,070
Jimmy,
what was he talking about?

3409
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:50,010
Oh No.
Oh,

3410
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:51,090
we'll figure it out.
Don't worry.

3411
02:28:51,091 --> 02:28:56,091
I want to do so and then I have to plug 
these dates and I remember that we were 

3412
02:28:56,091 --> 02:28:57,690
talking about people being nicer to each
other.

3413
02:28:58,530 --> 02:29:00,720
Uh,
we're talking about

3414
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:03,370
being able to change your comedy 
special,

3415
02:29:03,371 --> 02:29:08,371
being able to change your opinions on 
things and I think it's very important 

3416
02:29:08,371 --> 02:29:11,581
to be able to just change your opinion 
and that you are not your ideas because 

3417
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:16,120
you believe something doesn't mean you 
should be locked into it because.

3418
02:29:16,150 --> 02:29:17,420
Oh,
I remembered.

3419
02:29:17,450 --> 02:29:19,870
Okay.
A good way to judge yourself is to go,

3420
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:24,960
if you're 45 years old and you haven't 
maybe in the last so many years changed 

3421
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:26,200
your view on something.
How about we start with that?

3422
02:29:26,370 --> 02:29:28,900
We won't even take issue at hand it.
Well,

3423
02:29:28,901 --> 02:29:33,901
what does that say?
There's no way that you shouldn't be 

3424
02:29:33,901 --> 02:29:33,901
changing.
Simply should,

3425
02:29:33,901 --> 02:29:33,901
right?
So if it's not,

3426
02:29:33,901 --> 02:29:38,820
it doesn't have to be everything,
but we'd say in a 10 year period where 

3427
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:39,400
there are two things that you were 
adamant about,

3428
02:29:39,700 --> 02:29:41,440
maybe in two areas,
not everything.

3429
02:29:41,441 --> 02:29:43,000
Sometimes you're right,
you're right.

3430
02:29:43,330 --> 02:29:48,330
But if you can honestly,
not just outwardly to be writing an 

3431
02:29:48,330 --> 02:29:48,330
argument,
go,

3432
02:29:48,330 --> 02:29:48,520
y'all changed my opinion,
but go inward.

3433
02:29:48,521 --> 02:29:53,521
No one's around,
be honest with yourself and then you 

3434
02:29:53,521 --> 02:29:53,530
might be able to go in the dark of your 
own asking yourself,

3435
02:29:53,531 --> 02:29:54,730
go,
fuck,

3436
02:29:54,731 --> 02:29:56,710
I guess I really have it.
Yeah.

3437
02:29:57,310 --> 02:30:02,310
And then be aware of it.
And then there starts your change and 

3438
02:30:02,310 --> 02:30:04,731
we'll be back right after this.
Joe Rogan's our guests to me.

3439
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:10,870
Let me just for sure.
Get these folks.

3440
02:30:10,871 --> 02:30:12,490
Let me,
let me just say to you,

3441
02:30:12,790 --> 02:30:16,630
if you're in a place where todd glass is
performing so on the best standup comics

3442
02:30:16,631 --> 02:30:18,670
working in America today,
very funny guy,

3443
02:30:18,760 --> 02:30:20,590
and I do it right.
I get the two piece.

3444
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:22,600
Even while you're being set,
there's a two piece.

3445
02:30:22,750 --> 02:30:24,520
It's all right.
The minute you get in there.

3446
02:30:24,521 --> 02:30:25,330
Okay.
Jazz,

3447
02:30:25,331 --> 02:30:26,800
Texas.
I'm going to go to a jazz club.

3448
02:30:26,801 --> 02:30:28,870
It's not even a comedy club.
They reached out.

3449
02:30:28,871 --> 02:30:31,960
So in a,
in April 22nd and 23rd.

3450
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:32,890
Where does that?
It's called.

3451
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:36,510
It's in San Antonio,
Texas.

3452
02:30:36,580 --> 02:30:39,220
Bam.
I liked the shit gets crazy.

3453
02:30:39,221 --> 02:30:43,010
You're real close to Mexico.
Make a mad run across the border.

3454
02:30:46,130 --> 02:30:48,670
You're right there.
How far is it from San Antonio,

3455
02:30:48,671 --> 02:30:49,810
Texas?
I don't know.

3456
02:30:49,811 --> 02:30:54,811
I think they could shoot each other a.
So I say to Texas I met Mexico.

3457
02:30:55,050 --> 02:31:00,050
Yeah,
but I like Texas when I was sending him 

3458
02:31:00,050 --> 02:31:00,050
to.
Not the first time you said it.

3459
02:31:00,050 --> 02:31:00,050
Right.
Okay.

3460
02:31:00,050 --> 02:31:00,490
If you're that close to Mexico,

3461
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,340
like what's the closest city we have is 
Laredo,

3462
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:05,450
Passover,
Passover,

3463
02:31:05,890 --> 02:31:07,970
Passover.
The closest I've been in El Paso,

3464
02:31:08,390 --> 02:31:13,390
I heard El Paso,
like bullets of hit buildings like the 

3465
02:31:13,390 --> 02:31:16,310
buildings in El Paso.
Bullets from like the drug war have hit.

3466
02:31:16,660 --> 02:31:19,860
I was at Juarez.
Is Juarez right next to El Paso.

3467
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:22,110
Juarez is a particularly dangerous 
place.

3468
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:25,050
We don't need to go there,
but hey,

3469
02:31:25,230 --> 02:31:27,420
don't go there.
Go see todd glass.

3470
02:31:27,630 --> 02:31:29,510
Top performing.
Next fit.

3471
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:33,870
That's what I'm trying to do a fast.
I always feel guilty about.

3472
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:37,090
Well what's your website?
Let Todd Glass Co.

3473
02:31:37,430 --> 02:31:39,570
Less comedy.
You even know what it is,

3474
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:41,460
but he gets that.
ProbabLy talk less comedy.

3475
02:31:41,530 --> 02:31:41,850
Todd?
No.

3476
02:31:41,851 --> 02:31:44,070
Todd glass at todd glass?
No,

3477
02:31:44,071 --> 02:31:46,740
not Your email address.
Your website address.

3478
02:31:47,730 --> 02:31:50,830
Oh,
I'm not thinking very clearly.

3479
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,590
no worries.
Talk last.com

3480
02:31:52,591 --> 02:31:54,500
or something.
Talking to [inaudible] dot com.

3481
02:31:57,450 --> 02:32:02,450
Then I'll be at the blue room,
the blue room and I hate reading the 

3482
02:32:02,450 --> 02:32:05,040
blue room in springfield,
Missouri.

3483
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:07,590
And that's uh,
the seventh through the 9th of June.

3484
02:32:07,650 --> 02:32:09,720
Two more.
That's right.

3485
02:32:09,810 --> 02:32:11,310
Blue room.
I liked the pictures.

3486
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:16,640
A royal comedy theater in a hopkins,
Missouri.

3487
02:32:17,610 --> 02:32:21,000
It's a hot.
It's the royal comedy theater.

3488
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:22,410
This is,
this place is.

3489
02:32:22,890 --> 02:32:25,860
I love it.
And then it's a in hopkins.

3490
02:32:25,861 --> 02:32:27,150
Uh,
am I saying that right?

3491
02:32:27,151 --> 02:32:28,770
Missouri,
Minnesota,

3492
02:32:28,771 --> 02:32:29,760
Minnesota,
Minnesota.

3493
02:32:29,761 --> 02:32:31,920
He's going to punch me in the face.
June 20,

3494
02:32:31,921 --> 02:32:36,921
first through the 24th.
and then you have to stir crazy comedy 

3495
02:32:36,921 --> 02:32:36,921
club in Arizona.
Glendale,

3496
02:32:36,921 --> 02:32:40,890
Arizona.
Come on down boulevard in glendale.

3497
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:44,220
Stir crazy in Arizona and I need that 
just now.

3498
02:32:44,221 --> 02:32:45,170
What I just did.
Yeah,

3499
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:46,440
no lie.
My heartbeat.

3500
02:32:46,530 --> 02:32:48,490
Exhausting.
Exhausting.

3501
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:49,320
Yeah.
Because you're funny.

3502
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:53,430
You don't want to do that.
So difficult.

3503
02:32:53,431 --> 02:32:55,560
So hard.
