00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,010
So before they started modifying genes,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,210
how do they select,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:06,900
like say,

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,330
how do they.

6
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,950
Cause before any genetic modifications
were done in laboratories,

7
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:13,290
they had turned this Goc,

8
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,010
what did I say?

9
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,850
A Toc,

10
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:17,220
Toc or maize as we used to call it,

11
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:17,821
right?

12
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:18,870
That was the Indian word for it.

13
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,321
Even now,

14
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,610
even according to that
commercial that says its.

15
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,410
Yeah,

16
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,660
well the maze is kind of a general
term for everything from a field corn,

17
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,620
which is what we think about,

18
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:29,670
which is fed to animals,

19
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,850
which 80 percent of GM crops go to animal
feed and we differentiate that versus

20
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,290
a what is typically done by humans,

21
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,150
which is usually sweet corn varieties.

22
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,800
So how did they turn it before there
was any genetic modifications done in

23
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,310
laboratories?

24
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,180
How did they turn that
corn into what we now,

25
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,760
which is delicious and sweet
and you put butter on it.

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,660
It's fantastic.

27
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,081
Oh Shit,

28
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:52,800
how did they do that?

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:52,951
Yeah,

30
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:53,251
actually.

31
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:55,170
But it was all just random mutations.

32
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,760
DNA random.

33
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,330
Yeah.

34
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,590
DNA replication is a sloppy process
and funny things happen when you,

35
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:01,830
uh,

36
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,300
from a environment.

37
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:06,150
So in the process of
replication of DNA itself,

38
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,110
you can make errors.

39
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm cosmic radiation,

40
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,600
um,

41
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,400
just the chemicals in our environment,

42
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,200
natural chemicals that are out there can
induce changes in DNA and these kinds

43
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,790
of mutations sometimes very rarely
result in a change in the plant that's

44
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,410
beneficial and at least,

45
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:23,790
or at least from a human perspective.

46
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,890
So in all the plants that we've had,

47
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,030
all the plants that we have,

48
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:32,031
the significant amount of change has
come from random mutations that change

49
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:37,110
genes in ways we don't understand pieces
of DNA that get up out of the genome

50
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:39,180
and sit down somewhere else randomly.

51
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,530
They do this all the time.

52
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,570
Viruses in the plants that get into the
genome and sit down and places that we

53
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,560
have no idea where.

54
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,980
So genetic modification is something
that's ongoing and constant in a factor in

55
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,311
every genome,

56
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:54,150
including our own.

57
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,510
And so what we're seeing
today is just the,

58
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:57,900
uh,

59
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,740
the longterm effect that of humans who
have been able to put all the good traits

60
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:02,574
in one place.

61
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,860
So when you see those tomatoes that are
in the supermarket that are Pale and you

62
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,420
could play basketball with them,

63
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,110
those hard tomatoes and then you
compare them to like heirloom tomatoes.

64
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,290
The only difference between those two
is that someone had found some tomatoes

65
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:23,361
that had grown extra firm and selected
those and use the seeds from those to

66
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:28,080
create more similar tomatoes
and only select the dose.

67
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,471
Right?

68
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,270
So you frame two cool things here.

69
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:34,650
So heirloom what does an heirloom and an
heirloom tomato without standing eating

70
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:38,700
qualities that can't work in production
commercially because it's too mushy.

71
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,391
It's too mushy.

72
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,920
They don't last long and they break down.

73
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,090
But on the other hand,

74
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,160
so this is what the
problem is with our food.

75
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,540
When you talk about tomatoes,

76
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,201
strawberries,

77
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:46,621
blueberries,

78
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:48,480
things that these are non gmo by the way,

79
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,580
there is no gmo tomatoes or strawberries.

80
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,713
Not at all.

81
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,800
People would say there are.

82
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,350
The problem is is that plant breeding
over the last 50 years or say over the

83
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,183
last 100,

84
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,260
the.

85
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,710
The objectives of the
breeders has been bigger.

86
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,360
Fruit uniformity,

87
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,613
big yield,

88
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,030
disease resistance,

89
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,310
nothing about flavor and aroma.

90
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,730
So to meet production characteristics,

91
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,520
which is what we've been
selecting for breeders,

92
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:19,150
have been looking for these kinds of
characteristics that don't involve the

93
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:23,410
consumer and so our decline in the
flavors and the quality of fruits and

94
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,980
vegetables is directly
related to the mass breeding,

95
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,960
not anything to do with GMO.

96
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,500
So when you say genetic modified in,

97
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,920
in that,

98
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,753
in those terms,

99
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,440
they are kind of genetically modified,

100
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:39,250
but they're not modified in terms of
being in a laboratory and human beings

101
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,200
doing some funky stuff with jeans.

102
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,200
They're sort of modified almost
naturally and just selected for those

103
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:47,050
modifications.

104
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,730
Exactly.

105
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:47,860
And,

106
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,400
and some of the things that we've selected
for have been the ones that didn't

107
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:55,060
kill us when we ate them or the
things that didn't make a poison that,

108
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,360
uh,

109
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,010
or something that tasted horrible.

110
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:57,640
Um,

111
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,620
plants make lots of funky compounds.

112
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
And so this was an opportunity for us.

113
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,720
So what we've seen in our stores
right now is the residue of,

114
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,280
of thousands of years of human selection
and when we can call it genetic

115
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,600
modification if we want to,

116
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,300
but we can differentiate it from
what we do in the laboratory,

117
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,670
which is now we can call
adding a transgene where a
transgenesis moving a gene

118
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:23,671
from one background of genetics to another
via laboratory and these selections

119
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,860
that people have moaned
about and I have as well.

120
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,011
I mean,

121
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,700
it's horrible when you get a sandwich
and has a pale tomato on it because they

122
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,180
just taste awful though.

123
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,640
So there's no science involved in any
of that other than selection is no,

124
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,503
there's no.

125
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,600
There's no like injection of some alien
sort of genetics into those things.

126
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:46,900
Alien to the plant.

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,171
No,

128
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:47,561
there's no,

129
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:48,790
there's no syringes.

130
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,780
I'm nothing like that.

131
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,321
And it actually,

132
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:50,940
you know,

133
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,810
it is more an art than a science.

134
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,880
Being a plant breeder is the most kick
ass career these days and has been for a

135
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,714
long time.

136
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,140
Um,

137
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,320
plant breeding is essentially
inventing the next generation of food.

138
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,850
And all we're talking about is a mixing
pollen from things that maybe normally

139
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:10,390
wouldn't cross together like something
that nature would never cross,

140
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,710
but you got this cool tomato from Europe
that has great qualities and we can mix

141
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:18,340
it with this great production quality
tomato for that grows in Florida where

142
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:19,480
nothing else can grow.

143
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,440
And now you mix these two together and
you get this beautiful tomato that works

144
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,700
well and everybody's garden.

145
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,410
That's where we're going now.

146
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,820
But that's not gmo,

147
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:32,320
that's just using other types of
technology to facilitate this net,

148
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:34,240
this breeding process that breeders do.

149
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,350
Um,

150
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,350
but I think masculine aggression has
also given us so many of the goodies.

151
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,760
You want to go through the list of heaps
of fresh vegetables in the middle of

152
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,150
the wintertime.

153
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,960
Um,

154
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
all the inventions that
push us beyond our biology,

155
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,670
they takes.

156
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:54,190
It requires a little aggression.

157
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,170
I think sometimes,

158
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:57,004
and even,

159
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,801
God forbid,

160
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,160
I say

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,460
it,

162
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,420
competition,

163
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,710
ruthless competition,

164
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,901
things progressed.

165
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:05,510
The problem with that is that people
are going to lose and people don't like

166
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,410
lose them because they think
losing is a bad feeling.

167
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:10,580
So they think of competition and
competitive people as being negative.

168
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:10,971
Okay.

169
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,720
So that's what,

170
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,550
that's my worry about the
feminization quote unquote,

171
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,050
of our society.

172
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,380
I think that we have to be very careful
that we don't forget the positive

173
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:29,120
aspects of what you'd call
unoriginal macho energy.

174
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,030
I think the problem is that
it's not masculine energy.

175
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,250
That's a problem that
people were upset about.

176
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,660
I think it gets misconstrued.

177
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,050
I think the problem that we
all have is with assholes.

178
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,660
That is the problem across the board,

179
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:46,010
whether it's women or it's men when you
see like these crazy radical feminists

180
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:46,440
who uh,

181
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,440
a attack speakers because they want to
support men's rights in divorce court and

182
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,260
whatever the fucking reason
is that the really aggressive,

183
00:06:56,261 --> 00:07:01,261
like there's this archetypal video of
this super aggressive feminist outside of

184
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:05,090
this thing in Toronto and she's got red
hair and she's screaming at people like

185
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,030
what she wants and what she doesn't
want from men and when they can shut the

186
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,530
fuck up and you know,

187
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,120
and she's telling people in the honest,

188
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:12,760
shut the fuck up the people that,

189
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,540
that exist like that.

190
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,830
Then they become the problem because the
problem is not like the idea that women

191
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,700
deserve everything that men deserve and
that we should have equal treatment by

192
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:23,420
law.

193
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,010
The problem is assholes.

194
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,940
Assholes representing a point of view
that I probably don't disagree with,

195
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,100
but I disagree with her and I disagree
with someone who is generalizing about an

196
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:35,990
entire gender because that's ridiculous.

197
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:36,530
Of course it is.

198
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,530
Or generalizing about a type of person
that is in that gender like you can't it.

199
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,050
Everybody is entitled to start from
zero and as soon as you are prejudice,

200
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,500
whether you're prejudice against white
people or whether you're prejudice

201
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:56,060
against men or with your prejudice against
gays are transgenders or whatever the

202
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:56,894
fuck it is.

203
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,400
As soon as you stop treating that person
as like an you come at them from a

204
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,540
totally even spot,

205
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,461
then he,

206
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:04,400
you're the asshole.

207
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,060
Right?

208
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,530
And I would suggest that,

209
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,401
you know,

210
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:12,401
we benefit also enjoy a lot about life
at based on people who created things,

211
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:18,110
whose motives their motives may
have been less than stellar.

212
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,411
Show.

213
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,020
A lot of people that are
driven by just pure ego,

214
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,190
domination,

215
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,203
greed,

216
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,130
and those things are not.

217
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,950
Those things do not
always create bad things.

218
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,551
In fact,

219
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,190
a lot of times they create
incredible innovations,

220
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,390
better ways to do things.

221
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,770
You know so much.

222
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:34,070
What is,

223
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,600
what's another word for innovation?

224
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,940
Another word for
innovation is destruction.

225
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:43,210
You're destroying how people used to do
it when we came up with a the combustion

226
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:48,170
internal combustion engine and put it
in a vehicle and turn it into a car.

227
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,560
People that he made a lot of money making,

228
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,980
buggy whips went out of fucking business.

229
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,070
So I don't need your fucking Buggy whip
because my car doesn't respond to buggy

230
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,860
whips in response to what I call rock oil,

231
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,300
which turned out to be oil.

232
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,420
So that's the other thing to keep in mind.

233
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,740
Innovation is,

234
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,520
is isn't aggressive competition thing.

235
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:12,390
It's competition.

236
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:13,380
It's destruction.
