00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello Freak bitches while there's this
thing,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,510
uh,
speaking of guys who are in the business

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:07,950
of doing heroic acts,
there's a,

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,080
you've heard of the firemen fantasy.
I mean the fact that women find guys

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,190
bought fireman to be very attractive.
And it actually turns out that there was

6
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,920
a study that was done that actually
shows this to be the case.

7
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,140
And I discussed this in one of my
articles on psychology today.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,930
Uh,
if you have a guy approach women either

9
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:27,870
wearing a fireman suit or not,
uh,

10
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:32,430
his chances of getting her phone number
increases quite substantially.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,370
Really if he is wearing a fireman.
So how do they know this?

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,550
Did they do a study where they did they
have the same guy?

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,300
Not where the firemen with the same
approach and the same,

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,670
same word,
same script,

15
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,340
same everything.
One version.

16
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:48,360
It's called the field experiment.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,730
In one version.
You,

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,980
you approach women at a cafe wearing the
stuff and another version,

19
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,970
he's the guy who actually did that
research is a French psychologist.

20
00:00:56,971 --> 00:01:01,971
His name is Nico [inaudible] and I've
actually covered a few of his studies on

21
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:03,720
my website.
Uh,

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,770
my most read article ever over maybe
three,

23
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:12,771
400,000 readers is one of his studies
where I was simply,

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,960
because we're going to talk about the
blowback issue now and here again,

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,270
it was a study where he looked at the
likelihood of women being picked up as

26
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:24,870
hitchhikers as a function of their
breasts size.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,680
So he actually had the same woman and
they,

28
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,500
you know,
artificially manipulated her breast size

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,110
and on different days she would stand
there.

30
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:36,330
And,
and of course it turned out that men

31
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,200
were much more likely to pick up the
woman if she had the same woman that she

32
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,034
had bigger rest side.

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,190
So I just summarize that study,
put it up,

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,110
and then I remember I'd gone on
vacation,

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,110
came back from vacation,
found out that I had completely gone

36
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:52,560
viral,
but I had a million hate mail,

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,430
not just from readers but from fellow
psychology today,

38
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,940
bloggers who were arguing that I was,
you know,

39
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,960
peddling pornography because I had a
picture as the teaser image for that

40
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:06,540
article.
I had a photo of a woman sitting in a

41
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,480
passenger seat would big with large
breasts.

42
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,550
Well,
it seemed appropriate for the topic

43
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,440
given that that's what the topic of the
study was.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,400
But by putting that image,
I was objectifying women.

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,330
I was treating them as mere sex objects.
And so even though I had nothing to do

46
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,870
with the study and I was simply
summarizing somebody else's work,

47
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,110
I was a horrifying pornographic peddler.
Isn't it funny that just a photograph of

48
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,610
a woman with large breasts is considered
pornographic?

49
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,983
Now,
listen to this.

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,860
So then I've also written articles on
psychology today where I talk about all

51
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:40,190
kinds of issues dealing with penis size.
You know,

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,540
so do women want a guy with a bigger
penis?

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,820
Are they more likely to have orgasms?
She's got a bigger penis.

54
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,490
Uh,
if you're in a gay relationship,

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,630
man,
man,

56
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,230
uh,
are you likely to be top or bottom as a

57
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:55,680
function of your penis size?
That study has been done by science.

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,820
And so for those articles,
I put sexy images of men.

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,650
So then I wrote to each of those people
who had written the hate man.

60
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,484
I said,
well,

61
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,540
in all fairness,
you now have to write an equally hateful

62
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,420
thing.
Because I am also sexually exploiting

63
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:16,180
men's bodies.
Of course they went away and never came

64
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,580
back.
We have the,

65
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,790
I think this is one of the coolest times
ever to be alive.

66
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,540
I really do and I think that one of the
reasons why it's one of the coolest

67
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,450
times ever to be alive is because it's
just so chaotic and it's so strange and

68
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,250
no one can do anything about it.
No one can stop it.

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,400
Now they're going to try and net
neutrality and they're gonna try to put

70
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:39,730
the brakes here and charge people for
that and you're gonna,

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,550
you're in trouble and you're on a list
and I'm going to watch you.

72
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,950
What do you try to be anonymous?
You fucker.

73
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,390
I want to know where you are.

74
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,150
We were,
we were talking about this right before

75
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:51,790
the show,
like all that shit that's coming out,

76
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,910
like all the corruption and anger and
government and competence.

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,350
I'm starting to believe that it has to
be there because that's what wakes us up

78
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:01,900
to.
We don't need so many agencies.

79
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:04,930
We don't need like so many wars and so
much bullshit.

80
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:08,170
Let's just decide things for ourselves.
And of course we need some laws.

81
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,270
We need some police,
we need some roads.

82
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,950
And that's really it.
Thank you very much.

83
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,030
You know,
like have a nice day.

84
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,880
We don't need you archiving fucking baby
photos.

85
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,440
Yeah.
That's what we've gone over the line.

86
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,100
And so you're seeing the people realize
that people realize that banks are

87
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,860
ineffective ingredients.
People realize that the old media is

88
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,930
dying out and they don't give a shit
about their viewers.

89
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
So they're just moving over to better
stuff.

90
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,840
And it's happening across the board in
pretty much every industry even.

91
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,280
Um,
I had,

92
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,630
uh,
this woman,

93
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:38,830
Tiffany van goalie on my show recently.
He was another podcast host and she was

94
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:42,610
talking to me about how all these
grocery stores now have an organic

95
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:45,550
section and that's taking off.
And so you're seeing like this,

96
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,990
we have new standards.
Like that's,

97
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,900
I think what's happening is that we have
higher standards than we used to.

98
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,630
And so across the board is better stuff.

99
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,350
Yeah.
There's no doubt that things are getting

100
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:58,590
more complex and harder to control
because no doubt,

101
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,080
and there's no doubt that these old
systems,

102
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:04,530
whether it's like afternoon,
when you watch the news,

103
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:06,480
it's six or five or whatever the fuck it
is.

104
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,870
It seems like you're watching a parody,
right?

105
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,390
The anchorman is becoming more and more,
I mean,

106
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:13,500
when you,
when you watch,

107
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:16,200
if you try to watch like the La news
tried to watch any of those channels,

108
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:19,500
local news at five o'clock it's like
these people were aliens,

109
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,363
right?

110
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,870
I think these things,
we're not supposed to exist forever and

111
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:24,730
that's why to us it seems so kind of
silly.

112
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:26,920
It's like it's supposed to be dying out.
That's like the,

113
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,990
it's the new season.
New stuff's going to come out.

114
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,130
It's kind of like fashion,
right?

115
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:32,440
Like every year it's going to be
something different.

116
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,640
That's the way it works.
Now.

117
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:35,740
It's a corporate media and
centralization,

118
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,720
top down type stuff is dying out and I'm
sure it'll continue to exist in a bunch

119
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:43,450
of different forms,
but that idea is getting weaker and

120
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:44,284
weaker.

121
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,480
[inaudible]
okay.
