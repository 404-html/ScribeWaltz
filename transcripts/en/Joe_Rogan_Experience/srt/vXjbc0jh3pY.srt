1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,780
That what's her brother,
welcome back here.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,130
I'm back.
You're one of the few college professors

3
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:13,960
that I was a sense of humor about 
yourself like that.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,430
Well,
you can,

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,560
you can joke around about that.
Exactly.

6
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,160
It's,
it's,

7
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:22,161
um,
I was talking to you before the show 

8
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:24,531
started about this recent article in the
Atlantic and as soon as I saw it I was 

9
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:24,531
like,
oh,

10
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:27,780
this is just right up your alley and is,
it's the coddling of the American mind.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,840
And this article is all about one of the
things that you have been talking about 

12
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,310
a lot lately and um,
uh,

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,300
it's been on a lot of people's minds 
that work in academia because it's,

14
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:46,301
it's,
it's very confusing and it's very 

15
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:48,441
frustrating.
But there is severe limitations on the 

16
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:54,381
words that you can use and the thoughts 
even that you can have in this article 

17
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:56,730
is all about trigger warnings.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,000
And uh,
and in one case,

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,690
here's,
here's,

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,390
and there were professors,
listen to this law.

21
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:09,030
Students were asking fellow professors 
at Harvard not to teach rape law.

22
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,380
And in one case,
even use the word violate,

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,740
as in that violates the law.
Less it caused distress.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,160
This is the article is called the 
coddling of the American mind.

25
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:26,340
It's in the newest version of the 
Atlantic Dot Com.

26
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,360
It's just a couple of days old.
Um,

27
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,770
and it is,
it's fucking crazy what's going on with 

28
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:33,900
kids today.
And this,

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,380
this article gets into it and one of 
them was about something that,

30
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,620
um,
uh,

31
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,420
there was a professor for protecting 
himself with a pseudonym and he wrote an

32
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:50,421
essay for vox called I'm a liberal 
professor in my liberal students,

33
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,110
terrify me,
right?

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,800
What the fuck is going on?
Like what is going on where people are 

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,330
getting in trouble for words like 
violate.

36
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,350
Well,
by the way,

37
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:06,351
one of the authors of that article is a 
good friend of mine who is director of 

38
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:10,701
fire.
I can't remember the name of the 

39
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:10,701
accurate,
what the acronym stands for,

40
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:11,880
but he basically goes around,
his organization,

41
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:16,881
goes around trying to protect freedom of
speech first amendment at campuses,

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,340
precisely because of the unbelievable 
chilling effect of these types of lunacy

43
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:25,230
movements.
It's very strange.

44
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:30,231
And you know what else is strange?
It seems like you're not allowed to be 

45
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:34,491
conservative in a university and what,
and by conservative I don't mean 

46
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:38,520
restrictive of other people's liberties 
like anti gay rights or anti choice or 

47
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,040
anti.
I'm talking about fiscally conservative.

48
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,430
I'm talking about being a person who has
the ideas that some in the Republican 

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,550
Party,
a spouse,

50
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,820
you're not allowed to.
So I'm not sure if we discussed this 

51
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:54,820
before,
but even if we did,

52
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,980
it's worth repeating.
I talked about an article,

53
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,080
an article that was done by some 
colleagues of mine.

54
00:02:58,081 --> 00:02:59,090
I don't know them well,
but some,

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,830
some academics

56
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,070
where they looked at the political 
affiliation of professors at top.

57
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,320
I think it was California and schools,
uh,

58
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,830
whether they identified it or whether 
they actually had democratic affiliation

59
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:15,100
or Republican.
And as you might imagine,

60
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:18,520
it was extraordinarily skewed towards 
Democrats.

61
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,770
But then depending on the field of 
study.

62
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,800
So for example,
in sociology and in the humanities and 

63
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:25,900
in women's studies,
women with a y,

64
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,750
by the way,
please don't write women with an e.

65
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,120
That would be sexist at even,
as I just said,

66
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,510
the women oftentimes and women's 
studies,

67
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:39,511
they,
they think that to have men as part of 

68
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,780
the word women is itself a form of 
aggression.

69
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,360
So they've altered the spelling to 
weight men.

70
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,980
Oh no,
that's not real.

71
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,020
So you see,
I know your audience already has the 

72
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,620
price of admission covered.
Would that story,

73
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,320
but it's still the word women,
right?

74
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,670
So anyway,
so the same word.

75
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,010
Why?
Why do you have to change the letters?

76
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,590
So in sociology,
do you train,

77
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,620
change the word trigger because it 
sounds like the n word or a serious.

78
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,170
You're getting triggered.
I'm triggered,

79
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,250
triggered.
Well,

80
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,440
I'm fucking triggered.
If I was black,

81
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:12,600
I'd be super triggered.
Well,

82
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,050
I don't know if you noticed some of my 
tweets.

83
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:18,100
Now whenever I tweet anything,
I put a trigger warning trigger warning.

84
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,100
It's not become part of the vernacular 
to make it sit there article.

85
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,560
It's too close to the n word.
Way Too close.

86
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,120
I'm triggered.
But anyways,

87
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,960
to finish the point about the study,
44 to one ratio in sociology.

88
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,250
So imagine if you are a student,
take doing an Undergrad in sociology,

89
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,500
right?
It's not a very good thing to have.

90
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:43,501
Almost all of the professors that you 
will ever come across be of one 

91
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:43,501
particular persuasion.

92
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,070
Now some people will write to me and 
say,

93
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,350
but what do you mean the Democrats have 
everything,

94
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:52,351
right?
They have truth on their side and the 

95
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,151
Republicans are a bunch of hacks.
Now when it comes to evolution 

96
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:54,151
evolution,
that's true,

97
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:54,460
right?
If,

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,480
if,
if on average republicans are more 

99
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,480
likely to deny evolution than that point
is well taken,

100
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,840
but when it comes to issues,
is the death penalty,

101
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,990
right or wrong?
What's kind of fiscal policy should you 

102
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,901
have?
What type of foreign policy should you 

103
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:09,901
have?
This is not a one plus one,

104
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:10,240
you know,
scientific equation,

105
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,110
so you should be exposed to multiple 
viewpoints,

106
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,320
but of course you shouldn't be because 
you should only interact with people who

107
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:22,321
are similar to you will that.
That is a problem with a lot of people 

108
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,170
that go to college,
graduate,

109
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:25,300
get their phd,
get their doctorate,

110
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,970
and then start teaching and never enter 
the real world,

111
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,060
right?
They stay in this sort of insulated 

112
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,890
world of academia and then they espouse 
these same ideas.

113
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,220
They promote these same idea that they 
promote the same way of thinking as if 

114
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,390
this is the real world because this is 
the only world they know true.

115
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,470
You know,
one of the things about comedians is a 

116
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,890
lot of them are really,
really crazy and fucked up and they do a

117
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:55,891
lot of drugs and they're just out of 
control and not and they kind of forget 

118
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:58,010
that other people aren't like that and 
sometimes I'll bring like

119
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,070
one of my regular friends around like 
the comedy store and around some of my 

120
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,300
Canadian friends that are fucking crazy 
and they'll go,

121
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:10,301
Jesus Christ,
these guys just talk about ridiculous 

122
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:10,850
shit that they did.
Like it's no big deal.

123
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,930
And I'm like,
well,

124
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:14,840
in their world it isn't a big deal in 
their world,

125
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,480
this is the normal world and everyone 
else is civilian.

126
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,870
That's how they look at it.
That's how you know the quote unquote 

127
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,721
hardcore comedians look at it.
I think in academia you have a similar 

128
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:29,000
sort of a situation where they really do
believe in microaggressions.

129
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,400
They think that microaggressions are 
real.

130
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,550
There was a fucking.
This is one of the parts of the article 

131
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,460
that was really hilarious.
There was a.

132
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,990
They were trying to raise awareness 
about microaggressions,

133
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,080
but in doing so and raising awareness 
from microaggressions,

134
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,340
they had to give examples of these micro
aggressions which triggered people and 

135
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,740
it's an infinite loop of victimology.

136
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,400
So this guy had to apologize.
He apologized for triggering people with

137
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:07,661
his micro aggression.
Examples of them were like,

138
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,340
aren't you all supposed to be good at 
math to Asians like that?

139
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,750
That is a micro aggression.
I mean,

140
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,030
is it a microaggression to say good 
things?

141
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:22,031
This is what confuses me because like if
you said to a black guy,

142
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,110
you guys all have big Dicks,
right?

143
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Is that a microaggression?
Because then that's saying that 

144
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,450
perpetuating racial stereotypes,
right?

145
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:31,520
It is,
but isn't it a good stereotype?

146
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,410
Like everybody wants a big tick,
right?

147
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,220
Right.
Allegedly.

148
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,900
Right.
Well,

149
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,600
here's another microaggression that I 
thought was hilarious.

150
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,420
I'm colorblind.
I don't see race.

151
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,660
That's a microaggression.
You should see race.

152
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:45,920
Yes,
you should see race.

153
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:46,850
So Steven,
Kobe,

154
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:50,170
when he says he doesn't see race,
he is engaging in microaggression.

155
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,360
Microaggression,
go American.

156
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,260
The word American by the way,
is an aggression.

157
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,710
It's Americans that aggression.
Yet,

158
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,140
how's that?
Well,

159
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:03,141
because you're surfing all of the 
America is to imply that it's only the 

160
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,790
United States of America.
Somebody saying that it's America.

161
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,800
It's as if the rest of the countries 
don't exist.

162
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Wow.
One of them is America is the land of 

163
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,150
opportunity that is a microaggression 
and a white.

164
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Is that one offensive sense or here's 
another microaggression.

165
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,710
I believe the most qualified person 
should get the job.

166
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,710
Oh,
that's illegal.

167
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,350
That's a meritocracy.
That's bad.

168
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,370
How is that possible?
How could it be bad for the most 

169
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,751
qualified person to get a job?
Isn't that the whole idea of job 

170
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,961
applications?
We have a sponsor for this podcast 

171
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:46,391
called Zip recruiter,
and one of Ziprecruiter's thing is like 

172
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,000
if you want to fill it,
if they're trying to fill out a job,

173
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,560
it allows you to post to like 100 plus 
job sites with one click and the idea is

174
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:56,561
to find the most qualified candidate,
which in turn gets you the best person 

175
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,250
for the job,
which is a microaggression.

176
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,370
So ziprecruiter is a micro aggression 
company.

177
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,370
God,
how horrible.

178
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,740
It's lunacy.
I mean,

179
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,320
you wonder if at some point there'll be 
some sort of auto correction of all 

180
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,990
this.
I would hope so.

181
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,050
Right?
I think that that is what's going on 

182
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,070
with a lot of our culture.
I think what a,

183
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,100
what a lot of our culture is,
is an auto correction for the ignorance 

184
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:26,760
and hypocrisy of like the sixties and 
seventies and the eighties.

185
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,940
And so we're going away the other way.
Right?

186
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,030
You know,
with like,

187
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,960
did you see Bernie Sanders speech get 
interrupted for black lives matter?

188
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,470
Who doesn't think black lives matter?
I mean,

189
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,710
I want.
I want someone who doesn't think black 

190
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,420
lives matter to speak because I.
all I've heard is people who,

191
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,700
who agree black lives matter.
I mean everybody agrees.

192
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,900
I don't,
I don't know anybody who doesn't think 

193
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,400
that these shootings,
police shootings are horrific,

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,760
but to,
to interrupt a guy who is easily the 

195
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,791
most liberal.
That's what was going to say is that of 

196
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,320
all the candidates for president,
a guy who is the most diverse,

197
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:07,290
that guy will march with Martin Luther 
King know he marched in the civil rights

198
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:12,291
movement.
He's been a civil rights advocate since 

199
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,531
the 19 sixties and they interrupt his 
presidential speeches.

200
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,330
You don't have a theory that a lot of 
these,

201
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,480
a lot of these folks,
you know,

202
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,820
the Chegg,
Aveiro wearing tee shirt wearing guys,

203
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,580
they want to feel part of a greater 
cause.

204
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,700
Yes.
So even though many of those battles 

205
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,670
have passed them by,
they had been won civil rights.

206
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:34,020
I mean,
of course there's still racism,

207
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,020
but in terms of institutionalized 
racism,

208
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,360
we certainly are much better than we 
were 50 years ago.

209
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,070
But yet,
you know,

210
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,120
they're young kids,
they revolutionary.

211
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,040
They're wearing Che Guevara.
You know,

212
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,640
Viva La Revolution and they have to 
engage in this kind of behavior.

213
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Thirty years from now,
they'll watch that youtube clip and 

214
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:52,880
they'll think they're a bunch of 
buffoons.

215
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,780
I think that's a very valid possibility.
I think another possibility is that when

216
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:01,170
you look at people and they,
they,

217
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:06,171
they're,
they're trying to find like causes to 

218
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:09,120
support.
I think there's a lot of people out 

219
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,650
there that are just fucking assholes.
Right?

220
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,810
And what they're doing is trying to find
something that allows them to get out 

221
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,980
that asshole of aggression and be 
justified.

222
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:17,820
Right?
You know,

223
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:19,740
something that allows them to be 
righteous,

224
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:21,000
like black lives matter.

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You fucking pizza.
And there's screaming at someone who 

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
believes black lives matter,
uh,

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,930
screaming.
Someone was not even remotely racist,

228
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,140
but they will.
They will yell it in your face the way 

229
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,090
they did at this Bernie Sanders thing in
order to just get their rocks off.

230
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:41,091
Whatever personal frustrations,
whatever psychological failures that 

231
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,520
they have got bouncing around inside 
their head,

232
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,700
whatever closed loop thinking they have,
they're using these valid points and 

233
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:53,650
these things that a lot of people think 
about as a sounding board,

234
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,740
which is why they're the ones who are 
interrupting.

235
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,130
It's not that this,
this demands attention at this moment in

236
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:05,170
order to solve a problem because there's
a fucking fire.

237
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:08,020
We have to put this fire out right now 
where people are going to die.

238
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,390
No,
this has nothing to do with that.

239
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,000
It gives them the opportunity to grand 
stand,

240
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:18,001
to take a moral high ground and his 
scream out and beg for attention and to 

241
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:18,910
be good because nobody can.

242
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,880
You can't say it like racism fucking 
sucks.

243
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,320
Nobody can say,
hey,

244
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,960
it's not that bad.
You know,

245
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,800
he can't say that.
So you can.

246
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:31,801
You could be like super aggressive and 
really shitty and confrontational and 

247
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:36,661
insulting about a cause you believe in 
and that is one of the problems that I 

248
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:41,161
have with this whole social justice 
warrior movement because I find a lot of

249
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:46,591
these people that are involved in it to 
be asshole human beings and even though 

250
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:49,330
I,
I agree with a lot of what they support,

251
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,860
I think they suck and when I go to their
twitter pages and I look at what their 

252
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,671
interactions are,
all their interactions are insulting 

253
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:00,690
people and getting angry at people and,
and,

254
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,840
and it's all negative and I see if I can
please interject.

255
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,230
I think they don't have an ability to 
accept that people might have differing 

256
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,720
opinions.

257
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,660
Right.
You and I can debate many issues and yet

258
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:18,661
we can leave here both being respectful 
of one another and so I think that this 

259
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:19,660
course is.
I'm right.

260
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,890
If you think otherwise you must be an 
asshole and I will shut you down.

261
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,070
And so they really don't have this 
capacity,

262
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,110
this critical capacity to engage in 
reasoned dialogue.

263
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,460
I saw it.
I mean,

264
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,100
I'm lucky in that I don't really get 
many of these,

265
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:35,620
uh,
social justice warrior trolls.

266
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:40,621
I mean 99 percent of the people that 
interact with me are very nice and very 

267
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:41,260
sweet,
but that small one to five percent group

268
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:42,430
that,
as you mentioned,

269
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:45,910
are real assholes.
It's almost impenetrable to try to speak

270
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:46,360
to them.
Right?

271
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:51,361
I mean,
I engage them in a very dispassionate 

272
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:51,361
manner,
you know,

273
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:51,880
hopefully providing them with facts,
trying to be polite,

274
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,990
but I am an asshole simply for 
disagreeing with them.

275
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,810
So most of the people that I've blocked 
the aren't that many,

276
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:00,700
but the ones that I've,
that I've blocked,

277
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,970
it's because I try to engage them and 
the only way they could engage in return

278
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,770
is to insult.
And so it's a real,

279
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:13,771
it's a,
it's a real breakdown of civil 

280
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,871
discourse.
And also insult when it's just a matter 

281
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:17,350
of opinion about things that are 
debatable.

282
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:18,450
Exactly.
Here's one that,

283
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,130
you know,
the story about Occidental University or

284
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,460
Occidental College College College 
Occidental College,

285
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:29,461
where there was two students that got 
drunk and they're a boy and a girl.

286
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,360
They texted each other and the boy and 
the girl had sex and the boy got accused

287
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:38,170
of rape and kicked out of the school and
where the girls stayed and I was like,

288
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:39,280
well,
that's crazy.

289
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,920
Like first of all,
you're,

290
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,950
you're,
you're changing the rules of human 

291
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,721
behavior because people have been 
getting drunk and having sex since the 

292
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,540
beginning of time and so to call it rape
now,

293
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,280
after all these years,
just on a whim,

294
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,310
especially when two people are 
consenting adults,

295
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,330
they're consenting adults.

296
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,790
They can go to war and when they can't 
really vote yet or 18,

297
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,410
right?
You voted 18.

298
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,040
Yeah,
you can't drink.

299
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,400
They can't drink it,
but they're kind of Montreal,

300
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,230
Canada,
Montreal and you're crazy country.

301
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,980
But the idea that the boy is responsible
and the girls not to me seems ridiculous

302
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:17,771
and it seems contradictory to the whole 
idea of feminism in the first place is 

303
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:18,860
that we're equal now.
If we are equal,

304
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,950
why are we not equal in terms of our 
ability to take responsibility for being

305
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,170
under the influence?
I mean if your.

306
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,560
If you are responsible for being under 
the influence when you're driving.

307
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,750
If you're responsible for being under 
the influence,

308
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:37,751
if you commit violence,
why you're not responsible for being 

309
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:38,420
under the influence when you have sex.
If you're a girl,

310
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,890
that's crazy.
Well,

311
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,470
when I said this,
Oh my God,

312
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:47,471
the amount of people that called me a 
massage and vanilla rape enabler and 

313
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,850
enablists and ableist piece of shit like
they just.

314
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,080
But it was all insulting.
It's like how can it be insulting when 

315
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,080
this is a debatable point?
Was this co?

316
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,430
This is a clearly rational,
debatable point.

317
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:01,460
You talking about two human beings that 
are adults that got drunk,

318
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,120
but the male is the rapist like that.
That's ridiculous.

319
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,460
There are now,
I don't know the exact details,

320
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:09,590
but they are now on some university 
campuses.

321
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,860
You actually have a consent form where 
you sort of go through the iterative 

322
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,120
steps as you're starting to engage in 
sex.

323
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,290
So we are now in the foreplay stage.
Do you hear by consent?

324
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,730
And we pulled some like,
uh,

325
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:28,450
I think putting on Barry White music 
might be a bit more mood inducing than 

326
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,840
signing a.
it's a legal document,

327
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,900
white music as rape enabling.
Because what you're doing is you're 

328
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,150
coercing you or making the women 
aroused,

329
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,320
hence they don't have all their 
faculties for Barry White is a genocidal

330
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,740
rapist.

331
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,130
Well,
that's,

332
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,800
that's the language that they're using 
is I was unable to consent,

333
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,690
right.
Which obviously there's,

334
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,370
there's a scale,
right?

335
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:53,120
We can all agree that there is a level 
where people are at.

336
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,820
You are breathing deeply into that 
mixer.

337
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,760
So we had an issue with it the other day
because it's better because,

338
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,330
uh,
yeah,

339
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:01,580
we got to.
My friend Barry Crimmins was here and he

340
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:03,740
got a little hammered and he was 
breathing into the mic.

341
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:06,490
I got like 100 stopped people from 
breathing to the mic.

342
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,490
Tweets.
What is this,

343
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,380
Jamie?
Is this real?

344
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,040
Yeah,
this is.

345
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,690
Jake was drunk.
Josie was.

346
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,470
Oh,
that's right.

347
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,540
I've seen this.
Jay Can Josie hooked up?

348
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,600
Josie could not consent.
The next day jake was charged with rape.

349
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,700
There you go.
What the fuck is that?

350
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,220
That's a real poster.
I,

351
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:22,910
I tweeted that.
I remember this.

352
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,620
You know,
for example,

353
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:29,621
if a,
if a high status male seduces a lower 

354
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:32,540
status woman,
that itself could be construed as a form

355
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:37,541
of rape precisely because his powers so 
intoxicating like a professor and a 

356
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:39,380
student perhaps,
but in that sense,

357
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:40,940
I mean you might have an ethical 
boundaries,

358
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,130
right,
but I mean forget,

359
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,870
I mean just a guy who meets a girl at a 
bar and he happens to be a professor.

360
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,100
The rich man and a woman,
right?

361
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:52,110
Some of the virtue of the difference in 
hierarchy,

362
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,140
that itself could be construed as 
coercive because she wasn't able to 

363
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,010
control herself in the face of this 
overpowering man,

364
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,840
not physically just because it was high 
status.

365
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,050
Well,
the reality of being a male is if an 

366
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,721
attractive woman comes onto a man,
she's raping them because you're.

367
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:13,811
You have no control.
Like of a beautiful woman comes onto a 

368
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:14,310
guy like Jamie had a bar that poor kids 
fucked.

369
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,420
Look at them.
This is Jamie.

370
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,490
Jamie looking them over there.
He's fucked.

371
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,190
If some traci lords in her prime looking
chick comes up.

372
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,790
Jamie,
that's a reference from La.

373
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,500
I met her.
She still,

374
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,100
she wasn't she a porn start at 15 
because she fit easy,

375
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,950
not breck in the party.
Um,

376
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,410
yeah.
I believe she was lighter weight.

377
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,690
Since we're on a porn references.

378
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,180
Can I tell you maybe the greatest?
I,

379
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,190
yeah,
I received a lot of comments on my 

380
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,741
stuff.
Maybe the greatest one I've ever 

381
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:45,741
received.
Somebody wrote,

382
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:47,580
I hope I'm getting the exact quote in 
reference to me.

383
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:52,581
He wrote,
this guy is the Ron Jeremy of 

384
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:53,230
evolutionary psychology.
I said,

385
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,640
that's it.
I,

386
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,780
I could drop the mic and just,
you know,

387
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,950
retire well that means you're disgusting
but effective fat and sweaty and Harry,

388
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,560
that's what you're saying.
Well,

389
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,360
the whole thing about Ron Jeremy was 
ron.

390
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:11,130
Jeremy existed in an era where the guys 
were supposed to be gross because people

391
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:13,140
watching porn.
We're all guys.

392
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,280
So you wanted like a guy who is 
disgusting to be getting late.

393
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,190
So you like,
I got a chance this could happen.

394
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,050
Look how hot she hasn't.
She fucks Ron.

395
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:23,910
Jeremy.
Oh yeah.

396
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,470
Um,
nowadays the men are equally 

397
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:29,470
unattainable as well.

398
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,890
And the idea is that the women watch it 
with men,

399
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:32,130
right?
Allegedly,

400
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,080
I don't know anything about that.
No,

401
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm sure porns raping their culture.
Anyway,

402
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,900
that was contacted once a by a former 
porn star who had already uh,

403
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,910
you know,
he had,

404
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,390
he had the hat,
had the NBA,

405
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,590
I think an Mba,
and he wanted to pursue his phd with me.

406
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:53,220
He actually came up to Montreal,
spend a few days with me,

407
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,050
visited my lab and then ended up,
uh,

408
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,080
not,
not going on for a phd,

409
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,460
but uh,
so that's my,

410
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:01,470
uh,
the closest I've come to a porn star,

411
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,450
a guy who almost became a doctoral 
student.

412
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,720
That's interesting.
Well,

413
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,860
I can't even say his name.
I think a man who does that has a bit 

414
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,630
more freedom to move around over a woman
does that.

415
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:16,650
She's sort of labeled by our culture and
some sort of a weird way.

416
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,790
Maybe less so in Canada.
So in Canada I think in terms of as,

417
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,270
or a little bit more loose sexually.
Well you're,

418
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,460
you've been to Montreal,
you were there recently,

419
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,100
you see that,
I mean every second to store stores.

420
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:30,270
A strip bar.
Yeah.

421
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,650
You guys have a lot of strip bars up 
there,

422
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:36,060
but it's also just the way people talk 
and act about sex.

423
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,280
It just seems,
doesn't seem shameful,

424
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,230
less puritanical.
We're,

425
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,440
we're so fucking boys in Quebec is even 
more so what you're saying because it.

426
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,290
Exactly.
So it's good that European vibe.

427
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,690
So,
so in the,

428
00:20:48,691 --> 00:20:50,770
in the context of Canada,
you know,

429
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,800
some of the Anglo Saxon provinces 
historically might be closer to 

430
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,640
Americans.
Munter,

431
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,000
Kobeck.
It's a free for all.

432
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,440
Yeah,
cut back is crazy.

433
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,050
So like the,
the more um,

434
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,260
conservative spots are where there's 
very few people and everyone's scared 

435
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,401
and you believe in Jesus more.
Don't go to Saskatchewan if you want to 

436
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:11,401
get lucky.
Oh really?

437
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,030
Joking.
Saskatchewan,

438
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,780
Saskatchewan right now they're fucking 
warming up their fingers for hate mail.

439
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,040
But um,
that's how it is in America too.

440
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,630
It's like the spots that are like,
really,

441
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,940
there's not a lot of people there in the
middle of nowhere.

442
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,490
There's fucking church everywhere in 
those spots.

443
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Yeah.
I found that in a Latin America or 

444
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,530
Central America.
I was in Costa Rica recently,

445
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,830
and the poorer the neighborhood,
the prevalence of churches was like 

446
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,830
through the roof.
It was crazy.

447
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,230
We were driving to the cloud for us and 
as we're driving up there,

448
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:46,231
you pass her all these really small 
rural communities and you see a lot of 

449
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:46,231
churches.
Yeah.

450
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:46,960
Yeah.
When people,

451
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:51,961
I guess they need hope in those spots 
that are kind of solves the biggest 

452
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:54,400
potential mortality,
by the way.

453
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,740
Speaking of mortality,
let me do the segue.

454
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,470
It is your birthday officially.
The Godfather is hereby wishing you a 

455
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,580
happy birthday.
I thought,

456
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:06,850
what can I bless?
What can I get Joe as a gift,

457
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:08,360
by the way,
I owe you a copy of my.

458
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,700
One of my books signed.
Forgive me.

459
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:13,060
I didn't send it,
but this guy has got fame.

460
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:14,920
He's got the looks.
She's got charisma.

461
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:17,560
He's got money.
Keep going on and get them.

462
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:22,110
Anything good except I couldn't get him.
You just 11.

463
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,830
Yeah.
I don't want anything people keep 

464
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:28,830
giving.
Jamie gave me seven.

465
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:28,830
Cool though.
But,

466
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,130
you know,
I think that um,

467
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,830
the uh,
existential angst of a,

468
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,840
of death being solved by religion for a 
lot of people is like a nice little 

469
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,550
scaffolding to just sorta like carry 
your way through life.

470
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,880
You know,
people have gotten angry at me for 

471
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:44,880
suggesting that I'm not suggesting it 
for you or for anybody.

472
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,400
I'm not.
I mean,

473
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:50,401
I'm not suggesting there's a lot of 
things that people do that I wouldn't 

474
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:54,721
want to do that they do to kind of get 
by in this life or it's takes Xanax or 

475
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:55,560
uh,
you know,

476
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,720
or drink every night after work in order
to keep from kicking their dog.

477
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,720
I mean,
I don't know what the fuck is going on 

478
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,581
in your head,
but for a lot of people in these bad 

479
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:08,890
rural type situations,
it seems to be like,

480
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,720
it seems to be a common theme.
Right?

481
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,940
And if you really look at everything as 
being natural,

482
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:14,950
which is I what I try to do,
you know,

483
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,640
that term nature,
everybody wants to look at that as like 

484
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,430
wild life outside of cities.
I kind of look at everything as nature 

485
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,180
and I look at human behavior patterns 
and how much they repeat themselves as 

486
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,460
being pretty natural and these weird 
little spots where there's not a lot of 

487
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,430
people,
it seems to attract a lot of churches.

488
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,480
You know,
I,

489
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,460
I wrote an article on that point that I 
think maybe a year or two ago looking,

490
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,440
it was somebody else's research that I 
was summarizing,

491
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,070
looking at the content

492
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,130
of prayers.
So what is it that people pray about 

493
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,700
money as an example,
but as a function of their income 

494
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:54,830
status,
socioeconomic status,

495
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,700
and as you might predict,
uh,

496
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,840
the content of what I pray to God about 
drastically changes as a function of 

497
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:05,910
where I fit in that hierarchy.
What do people that are really rich pray

498
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,760
about?
Maybe health must be right?

499
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:10,850
Yeah.
Health and family and stuff like that.

500
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,750
Yeah.
Uh,

501
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,430
it's,
um,

502
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,590
it's one of those things where I,
I reluctantly,

503
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,640
I'm not just accepted but I can almost 
supported because you mean religiosity.

504
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,670
Yeah.
For people that are in bad places and 

505
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,450
bad situations,
I see that it helps.

506
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,420
Well,
so chapter eight of one of my books is I

507
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:39,290
titled it very provocatively perhaps 
marketing hope by selling lies,

508
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,710
right?
And I give different examples of hope 

509
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,710
peddlers,
a medical quacks,

510
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,410
a self help gurus,
and of course I argued that the greatest

511
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:50,680
peddler of hope is of course religion.

512
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,300
Uh,
and so you're exactly right.

513
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:57,301
It's a,
I think it takes almost a maladaptive 

514
00:24:57,301 --> 00:24:59,900
honesty to not believe because it is so 
much more comforting to believe.

515
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,020
And also the people that decide not to 
believe.

516
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:08,021
It's almost like they have to try so 
hard in those areas to not believe that 

517
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:12,851
they become angry about it.
They can become angry about their 

518
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:12,851
disbelief.
Right.

519
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,510
You know,
I'm a nonbeliever,

520
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,190
but I'm not angry.
I'm very gentle.

521
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,600
You will.
You're very intelligent man.

522
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,690
Well,
you recognize these patterns and not 

523
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,000
succumb,
but for a lot of folks,

524
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,840
for a lot of folks also,
you're dealing with so many people in 

525
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:28,840
your community.
There are also a part of that.

526
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,420
And then the church becomes like a sort 
of a community center by proxy.

527
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,690
What David Sloan Wilson,
who's a evolutionary biologist,

528
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:37,880
a good friend of mine,
very famous biologist,

529
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,120
he looks at the evolutionary roots of 
religion and he actually argues a great 

530
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:48,671
book I'm doing is plugging for him now 
that I think he wrote in 2002 Darwin's 

531
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:52,721
Cathedral where he actually demonstrated
or argued that groups that are religious

532
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,250
actually out survive.

533
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,400
Those that are not using an argument of 
commonality,

534
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:03,401
right?
Groups that are religious are more 

535
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:03,401
cohesive.
Band together are more communal,

536
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,130
therefore they should be able to survive
other groups.

537
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:07,850
Now,
his,

538
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,970
his theories are a bit contentious 
because many evolutionary psychologists 

539
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,780
and evolutionary biologists reject the 
idea that evolution can happen at the 

540
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,951
group level.
They argue that evolution should happen 

541
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:20,951
at the individual,
at the gene level,

542
00:26:20,951 --> 00:26:22,880
and this is a fight that he's been 
having for many years now,

543
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,090
but that's one example where you could 
actually study religion not only from a 

544
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,570
scientific perspective,
but from an evolutionary perspective.

545
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:35,410
I have a friend who lives in a married 
male and female are married in a sort of

546
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:41,090
a rural area and a long time ago I was 
having this conversation with them,

547
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,150
um,
where the,

548
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,340
the wife was

549
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,870
just sort of explaining how if it wasn't
for religion,

550
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,900
her and the husband wouldn't be together
and the way she was saying it was 

551
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,770
counseling,
her husband was dumb and like he needs 

552
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,960
something to keep him like on this good 
path and pattern.

553
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,390
And they'd been married for like at the 
time,

554
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,730
I think like 15 or 20 years.
And she was like,

555
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:10,731
do you think that we would have still 
been together if it wasn't for our 

556
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:13,821
belief in God and Lord and whether or 
not an edge goes whether or not it's 

557
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:14,100
real.
Wow.

558
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,060
And I was like,
Whoa,

559
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:18,050
this is some heavy shit.
It's almost like she's given her husband

560
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:23,051
some sort of placebo to like,
keep this guy from drinking and fucking 

561
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,860
getting on a train like a Hobo or 
whatever the hell she do.

562
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,880
You know,
like God kinda kept them together and 

563
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:31,880
kept the family together.

564
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,260
But she was looking at it in a very 
pragmatic way and I was like,

565
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:35,430
wow,
this is deep,

566
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,660
you know,
the Middle East.

567
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:41,661
And I've seen it in my own family.
There was this incredible fatalism that 

568
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,300
comes with religiosity.
So I have a family member of.

569
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:49,430
I won't mention who it is,
who's was Ariel Helwani not are you 

570
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,320
highlighted by the way?
Shout out to my nephew and to all the 

571
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,360
twitters,
twitter is out there.

572
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,720
He really is my nephew.
He's my sister's,

573
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,710
uh,
son.

574
00:27:59,250 --> 00:27:59,970
Uh,
but anyways,

575
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,690
so this male member,
uh,

576
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,850
not rel a shout out to Ariel,
he,

577
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:11,090
he views everybody.
He was everything through the lens of 

578
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,930
it's God's will.
So if he opens up a store and the store 

579
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,021
doesn't do well,
well it's not that he might have made 

580
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:20,841
some bad poor business decisions.
It must be God's will had God wanted it 

581
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:24,960
to be differently than things would have
turned out differently.

582
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:30,250
And,
and that type of fatalism is actually 

583
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,830
quite a depressing and that it doesn't 
allow for a feedback loop.

584
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:32,200
Right?
I mean,

585
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,460
you don't get feedback from the 
environment that says change course of 

586
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,521
action.
If everything that happens happens 

587
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:42,801
because it's God's will,
then you really just an empty vessel 

588
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,430
that's just executing God's will and so,
uh,

589
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,080
and you see that a lot in the Middle 
East.

590
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:47,820
If God wants and child life,
God,

591
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:48,420
this,
if God,

592
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:53,421
that if it meant if it was meant to be,
it's really part of the loss of the 

593
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:56,250
Arabic language,
the practice and feedback loops are what

594
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,240
it's all about.
I mean,

595
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:02,241
that's what life is when you're opening 
a business or doing a sport or you know,

596
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:07,941
whatever the fuck it is.
Practiced resume reviewing data feedback

597
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,730
loop making possible corrections,
objectivity.

598
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,770
Yeah.
All those things are what makes people 

599
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:16,770
improve.
And matter of fact,

600
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,890
I read an article recently about music.
Were there,

601
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,900
were there were discussing music that 
the inherent qualities of someone's 

602
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,381
music or really just a lot of what makes
a great musician his practice and 

603
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:31,250
feedback loops right there.
I mean that's really what it is.

604
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,380
Not God's will but,
but if you believe that,

605
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,170
you know,
it's limiting and empowering at the same

606
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:38,060
time.
Exactly.

607
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,890
Because if you also are involved in this
practice feedback,

608
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,130
but you really think God's

609
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,300
on your side because you play a mother 
fucking mean acts,

610
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:49,630
there's actually a psychological trait 
that maps onto what we're talking about.

611
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,250
This.
It's a locus of control.

612
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,110
Are you familiar with this term?
Do you know what?

613
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,160
No,
I'm not.

614
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,370
So locus of control is basically ideas.
Some of us are internally driven in 

615
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,781
terms of our locus of control,
meaning that we attribute things that 

616
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:03,781
happened to us,
to us,

617
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,180
I did well on the exam because I studied
hard because I'm intelligent.

618
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,300
Okay.
Versus external locus of control as you 

619
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,810
attributed to environmental factors.
I did poorly on the exam,

620
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,660
not because I didn't study,
but because the professor is an asshole.

621
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,690
He's an Indian.
Right?

622
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,450
And so people who score high on external
locus of control,

623
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,480
then you can predict certain other 
behaviors,

624
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:27,520
for example,
they're much more likely to be gamblers.

625
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,490
Right?
Precisely because it's fatalism,

626
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:30,730
right?

627
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,290
I mean,
my turn will come.

628
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,300
It's written in the skies,
uh,

629
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,310
the black.
It should be up soon,

630
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:39,160
right?
If you're internally locus of control,

631
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:43,060
then you know that all that stuff is 
random and they're red and black or just

632
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,820
they come and go depending on how that 
ball drops.

633
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,290
Exactly.
Yeah.

634
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:50,770
That's a lot of people do really firmly 
believe in that.

635
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,780
Yeah,
and it's sort of there.

636
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,450
That's how they get through this life 
and it's very much a blinder.

637
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,380
It puts them in a very narrow channel.
It's very difficult to escape.

638
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,400
Once you have that firm belief,
you know of have that.

639
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,850
These patterns are sort of clearly 
established.

640
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,220
It's going to be my time.
My time is coming.

641
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,190
Well my time.
Going back to the gambling casinos,

642
00:31:15,191 --> 00:31:20,191
actually our operators are very spot.
They play on that cognitive illusion 

643
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:25,570
because what they do is they give you 
this card where you keep track of how 

644
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:27,850
many times it's come on read and how 
many times,

645
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,450
how many times the number 13 has come as
a complete illusion,

646
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:31,660
right?

647
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:36,930
It's giving you a car.
You could take a car so when you play 

648
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:36,930
relapse.
Exactly.

649
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,890
So if you go to the Montreal casino,
you can get those cars.

650
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,500
Oh look,
13 has come up 14 times,

651
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,930
but I think 37 is up.
Should be up soon.

652
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,020
Right.
What it's doing basically is it's giving

653
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:50,620
you a sense of control over otherwise 
completely random events.

654
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:55,621
Right?
Each of those throws the ball are 

655
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:55,720
independent events.
I mean,

656
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,750
unless it's a rig machine,
so the casino operators understand you 

657
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,730
and psychology and they play on it and 
then the idiot succumb to it.

658
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,830
How rude.

659
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,830
That's uh,
the,

660
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,510
the,
the.

661
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,890
But what's crazy is when luck is on 
their side,

662
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,650
it seems real like when you get a hot 
hand,

663
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:18,550
like,
I don't play craps,

664
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:21,400
but I've seen people play craps and they
get a hot hand.

665
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:23,100
They start rolling dice,
right?

666
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,230
And they feel like they can lose and 
they'll go on a hot streak.

667
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,650
They'll go on a hot streak with,
with Black Jack as well.

668
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,370
They get the right cards,
poker and it feels like it's happening.

669
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,240
But because that hot streak is itself a 
random pattern,

670
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,980
I'll tell you a great,
great story and I'll

671
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,980
actually mention who it is.
I hope he won't be upset if I mentioned 

672
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:44,980
this.
It's my father who is a avid six,

673
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,790
49 player.
I Bet your dad doesn't listen to this 

674
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:49,820
shit.
Probably not 6:49

675
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:52,370
basically is a.
is a lottery game played in Quebec.

676
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,340
You,
you choose six numbers out of 49.

677
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,230
Your chances of getting it are,
as you know,

678
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:02,310
infinite.
There's really small and so one day he 

679
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,140
had called me at the office at my 
university office,

680
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,150
said,
hey son,

681
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,390
I'm,
I'm playing some,

682
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,070
some,
some cards.

683
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,360
Give me six numbers and say,
oh,

684
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,120
that I have some students in my office,
can I call you back because it just,

685
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,070
just give me six numbers.
So I said,

686
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:13,520
all right,
one,

687
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:13,850
two,
three,

688
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:14,240
four,
five,

689
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:15,380
six.
So then he goes,

690
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:20,381
well,
if you're not going to take the damn 

691
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:20,381
game seriously,
why am I calling you right now?

692
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:23,680
Why did he do that?
Because he actually was convinced that 

693
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:23,680
the numbers one,
two,

694
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:23,680
three,
four,

695
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:23,680
five,
six,

696
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,271
and I bet some of your listeners will,
will also think that the numbers one 

697
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:28,820
through six are,
is,

698
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,880
is less likely of a combination to come 
up than any other combination of six 

699
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,130
numbers simply because it has the 
illusion of of looking ordered.

700
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,600
Right?
But it isn't.

701
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,630
It is just one of the 14 million 
possible combinations that I think it's 

702
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,330
one out of $40 million.
So again,

703
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,560
these,
these biases,

704
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:50,561
these cognitive traps are so alluring 
and it's so easy for people to succumb 

705
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:54,431
to them.
Is it single digit numbers can be 

706
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:54,500
doubled if it goes up to 49,
49 digits?

707
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:54,840
No,
no.

708
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,080
Forty nine numbers.
One to 49.

709
00:33:57,081 --> 00:33:59,240
You pick your six,
12,

710
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,590
18,
39,

711
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,530
42.
And so I just picked one through six and

712
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:08,531
he was absolutely convinced that that 
combination of six numbers is simply 

713
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:10,940
that you're a fool.
I'm an idiot.

714
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,610
The lottery itself is such a trap.
My grandmother used to only talk about 

715
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:22,091
the lottery.
She talked about the lottery and dead 

716
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:22,690
people that were talking to her.
My grandmother was like,

717
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,530
she was crazy and she,
uh,

718
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,800
she firmly believed that she had some 
psychic ability,

719
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,130
right.
And uh,

720
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,030
she's always like,
I knew that number was going to come up.

721
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:37,390
She would always tell you I was going to
bet that she would talk about what 

722
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,931
number she was going to bet and I was 
going to bet nine that didn't put it in 

723
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:41,780
and you know,
19 through sick too,

724
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:46,910
you,
she rattle off whatever the fuck the 

725
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,271
number was.
And this was back in the day in New 

726
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:51,080
Jersey where I'm the,
they would play the numbers,

727
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:55,320
which is like this local created sort of
lottery that the mob ran.

728
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,880
It was this weird thing and my 
grandmother was a part of it.

729
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,460
She would like help run the numbers.
Nice.

730
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,300
Yeah.
She,

731
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,940
uh,
I don't know what her function was,

732
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:09,941
but she was a part of it to the point 
where she got arrested and did six 

733
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,950
months in jail and they're running the 
numbers and she wouldn't,

734
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:15,290
she wouldn't rat anybody out.
So,

735
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:15,890
uh,
you know,

736
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:17,840
my,
my grandmother would like a knit,

737
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,690
like little scarves and shit for the 
guards.

738
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:23,750
And do all kinds of weird shit.
I didn't find out about this until later

739
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,390
when I was a kid.
We just thought grandma was just fucking

740
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,210
busy traveling or something.
We had no idea where the hell she was.

741
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,670
We'd go visit grandpa.
Where's grandma?

742
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,230
Couldn't find her.
She was,

743
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:38,231
oh,
she's visiting your aunt Mary or she's 

744
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:38,231
a,
you know,

745
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:38,231
it was always like.
But really she

746
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:39,420
was in the pokey.
Right.

747
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,540
Doing hard time for numbers.
So speaking of kind of Kooky a family 

748
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,840
members,
I have a paternal aunt and I've actually

749
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:50,990
written about this general what tasks 
geography is.

750
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,860
It's a fancy term for something that you
might otherwise not.

751
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Does that term go.
So Tasha Griffey is the reading of your 

752
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,820
fate since we're talking about these 
issues through a.

753
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,350
In the Middle East,
we do it with the tea leaves or that you

754
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:06,690
could do with [inaudible] or you could 
do it with the residue.

755
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:08,830
That's what you flip over the coffee 
mug.

756
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:11,910
That right.
So the residue that's left,

757
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,060
that's what you read.
So this lady would come over to our 

758
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,060
house and that was,
you know,

759
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,280
maybe a seven,
eight,

760
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:22,281
nine year old boy and I already knew 
that the Jig was up on this thing and 

761
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:22,281
she,
when she would come over,

762
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:23,570
it would be like the pope is visit 
thing,

763
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:23,870
right?

764
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,870
And lower rise coming over to tell us 
about our future.

765
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,510
So then she would start,
she'd look at these,

766
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,600
these,
these random patterns and the things 

767
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:35,600
that you would say are,
you know,

768
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,900
I see happiness in your future.
Well I could have a good bowel movement 

769
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:42,080
later and that's happiness.
The Dallas cowboys could win.

770
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,690
That's happiness.
My wife and I can have sex tonight.

771
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:49,710
Then that's happiness.
So there was no way to falsify her 

772
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,160
profoundly general prediction,
right?

773
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:50,850
She,
she,

774
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,590
she never.
She never looked at the,

775
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:58,010
at the residue and said,
you will be getting a 13 point seven 

776
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,520
percent increase in your income.
Right?

777
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:02,340
Specificity is the enemy of these 
fortune tellers.

778
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:05,070
Right?
So they give you these vague predictions

779
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,330
which you could then fill into your life
in any infinite number of possible ways.

780
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,690
Yeah.
We had this guy on the Scifi show that 

781
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,931
it did,
his name is Bennett check and he's a 

782
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:18,570
master at what he calls,
they call it mentalism or something like

783
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,430
that and he's a mentalist.

784
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,820
And uh,
he is one of those guys that will tell 

785
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,690
you absolutely straightforward.
This is bullshit.

786
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,990
I am,
I am using tricks and I won't tell you 

787
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,300
what the tricks are,
but I will tell you right now,

788
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,670
I am not a psychic.
This is not magic.

789
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Magic is not real.
He actually gets angry at people that 

790
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,160
pretend that they could read,
like you remember,

791
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,400
there was a whole series of those shows 
that they've since pulled off the air,

792
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,720
but where there was psychics and you 
know,

793
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,010
they were like,
there was like the long island medium,

794
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:50,720
right?
Remember that?

795
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:54,000
And they were talking to people's dead 
relatives and all those are some that do

796
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:57,450
with dead animals.
It wasn't one of those things.

797
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,260
There's one,
it's.

798
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,970
So there is a cross species psychic.
Can you imagine your fucking dog doesn't

799
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:06,570
say Jack Shit to you when he was alive,
but when he's dead,

800
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:08,070
he starts talking to psychics.
That's right.

801
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,090
Yeah,
man,

802
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,650
I didn't like the way you pet me,
bro,

803
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,840
at the back of my head like I'm an 
asshole.

804
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,540
Right.
Well,

805
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:16,230
this,
um,

806
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:21,290
this idea that someone can actually read
into your past and pull this information

807
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:28,020
is so appealing to people that they 
mistake the way the person's questioning

808
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:34,521
them and the clues and the little bits 
of information that they give and how 

809
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,220
this person is really just good

810
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,220
at forming puzzles based on pattern 
chunking.

811
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,020
Exactly.
They just know how to.

812
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,020
They know they've done this so many 
times they know how to get it,

813
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:49,021
but this guy,
even though he told me what he was 

814
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:49,780
doing,
we had some people in the audience.

815
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:54,010
We had a small audience and we had him 
perform these tasks and these folks have

816
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:56,140
them come up and he would ask them 
questions.

817
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:57,520
It was amazing.
I mean,

818
00:38:57,521 --> 00:38:58,690
he's just really,
really.

819
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:00,490
Despite the fact that you knew all the 
tricks,

820
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:02,410
it was easy to sort of succumb to the 
illusion.

821
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,600
Here's the thing though,
I don't know the tricks.

822
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:09,630
I just know they are tracked.
She wouldn't tell us what the tricks 

823
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:09,630
were,
but he said,

824
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,080
like,
I'm telling you,

825
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,630
I am not a psychic by any stretch of the
imagination.

826
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,990
And he did a bunch of other cool stuff 
like you bent spoons and stuff like that

827
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:17,740
with his mind.

828
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,760
Right?
It's bullshit.

829
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:19,660
He's like,
it's all bullshit.

830
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,700
I'm using trickery.
He goes,

831
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,610
but I won't tell you how I do it,
but I'm not magic.

832
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,790
Which would be really rude if he 
actually was magic and it's just like 

833
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,971
his,
his shtick is calling out all these 

834
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:33,400
other people who were also actually 
magic.

835
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,550
Imagine that it was like a sellout for 
all the real magic people.

836
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,310
Right.
My sister was in high school.

837
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,420
She went to one of her friends,
uh,

838
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,230
hired a psychic and they all sat around 
and this psychic would like,

839
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,980
slowly but surely read them.
I was,

840
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,490
I was very,
always very skeptical of stuff like 

841
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,921
that.
From the time I was little because I 

842
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:55,921
knew my grandmother was fucking crazy 
and she always claimed to be psychic,

843
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:58,750
but listen to my sister come back.
She would tell me all this stuff,

844
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,540
you know,
she knew all about this and she knew all

845
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,120
about that and she knew about the time I
did that and I'm like,

846
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,010
didn't you know about all that stuff?

847
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,260
She's not telling you anything you don't
already know.

848
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:10,000
So she's telling you stuff you already 
know.

849
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,080
Yeah.
I'm telling you.

850
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:12,460
It was amazing though.
I was like,

851
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,930
how is it amazing that she tells you 
shit that you already know what?

852
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,270
That's not amazing yet.
There's a study,

853
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:24,271
I can't remember the exact reference,
but you could take the astrological 

854
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:24,500
predictions,
you know,

855
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,520
the twelfth and you're giving it to 
people randomly and anyone that I give 

856
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,991
you,
he'd be able to argue that perfectly 

857
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:33,991
fits you.
Right?

858
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:34,610
Of course.
I see.

859
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:39,611
Because it is so vague that you could 
infuse your life into any one of these 

860
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:40,930
sort of vague the script for this.
So yeah.

861
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,190
Yeah.
They're ultra vague.

862
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,720
Yeah.
But those are stupid.

863
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:48,721
Like,
those today will be an amazing day for 

864
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:48,721
business.
Like fuck,

865
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:50,010
you know,
you want to know specifics.

866
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:55,020
Right.
But I had a friend who ran into someone 

867
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,640
in Venice beach and uh,
the guy was like,

868
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,700
one of those save the rain forest type 
dudes.

869
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,830
He had like some little stands up and he
said,

870
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:02,590
if I guess your birthday will you listen
to me?

871
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,510
And my friend was like,
go ahead.

872
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:08,830
And he gets his birthday on the day and 
then he was,

873
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,060
wow,
the fuck did you do that?

874
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:12,220
He goes,
will you listen to my story now?

875
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,510
But the rain forest.
And he goes,

876
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,570
do that to my friend.
He brought his friend over and he gets 

877
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:18,580
his friend's birthday to.
Yeah.

878
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,590
To what?
Let's say.

879
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,100
I don't know,
man.

880
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,240
That's what I'm saying.
I'm reserving judgment on that story 

881
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,240
too.
Know it's a true story.

882
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,260
My friend definitely didn't lie.
He's because he's baffled by it.

883
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,020
Here's where I told Penn Jillette 
obviously.

884
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:32,380
Yeah,
yeah.

885
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,850
Musician,
magician rather.

886
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,960
And a good friend of mine.
And so I said,

887
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,190
how's this guy do that?
He goes,

888
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:38,550
there's,
there's techniques you can do that.

889
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,550
How do you deal with it?

890
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,410
Man Guys shows up and he says to you,
you know,

891
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,150
I can guess your birthday.
He doesn't know you.

892
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:50,120
You don't know him.
How the fuck is that possible?

893
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,590
And he told me there's techniques.
I'm like,

894
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,960
what the fuck,
man?

895
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:59,170
There's 365 days a year.
How is that guy going to guess that 

896
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,950
William stumped and it's not even one in
365,

897
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,300
right?
The odds of you nailing it,

898
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,330
it's probably higher than one and 365,
right?

899
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,890
Isn't that work?
That are.

900
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,810
There are interesting probabilities.
What,

901
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:13,811
for example,
if you were to say how likely are to 

902
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:15,950
people in a room to have the same 
birthday,

903
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,400
that number,
and I don't remember what I've seen a 

904
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,860
lot longer than you think it is a lot 
higher than you think.

905
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:23,040
Exactly right.
A lot higher than you.

906
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,240
And I remember when,
when I took probability and stats,

907
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:25,630
uh,
you know,

908
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,660
as a math on the ground,
that's one and sort of the classic 

909
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,331
examples that you,
your study precisely because it is so 

910
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:34,331
counterintuitive.

911
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:38,410
Yeah.
There was a show where someone did that 

912
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,830
and they went into,
it was like one of these conmen dudes 

913
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,870
went into like,
he bet people and he went into a Oh,

914
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:49,460
like a restaurant and he had like the 
day to find two people.

915
00:42:49,461 --> 00:42:54,461
Yeah,
like certain amount of time to find two 

916
00:42:54,461 --> 00:42:54,461
people that share the same birthday that
worked there or that,

917
00:42:54,461 --> 00:42:58,991
uh,
that we're in a customer's there and he 

918
00:42:58,991 --> 00:42:58,991
nailed it in like an hour.
Yeah.

919
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,020
Yeah,
exactly.

920
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:01,010
Yeah.
Cool.

921
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:06,070
Just a bunch of people coming in and you
get like a May twelfth or whatever the 

922
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,070
right.
Yeah,

923
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:10,961
but,
but the idea that someone could just 

924
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:13,091
point at you godfather,
I believe your bus stalling and Axon 

925
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,350
came out there.
Gad Fad,

926
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,090
fad,
the um,

927
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,130
you know,
I don't know how anybody does that,

928
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:24,131
but according to Penn Jillette,
I got to listen to him though because 

929
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:25,400
he's a fucking magician and those guys 
were all tricksters.

930
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,400
They know how to do shit.
Like one of the cool things about Penn 

931
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:30,400
and teller,
if you ever go to wash them,

932
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,300
is that they'll tell you it's bullshit 
while they're doing it.

933
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,520
And you have no idea what the fuck they 
just did,

934
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:35,690
how they did it.
Incredible.

935
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,960
Yeah.
That's all really sneaky stuff is just 

936
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,590
managing illusions,
right?

937
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,380
I mean,
that's what they're doing.

938
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:47,650
Yeah.
And that's what's really cool about the 

939
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:48,230
band check character was that he was 
like really adamant about that stuff and

940
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:53,231
very angry about people steal money from
folks by claiming to be mediums and 

941
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:54,830
talking to their relatives.
And he's like,

942
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:59,831
I just think that anyone who would try 
to give someone hope that perhaps their 

943
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:04,421
dead relative is talking from the grave 
and telling them important things they 

944
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:06,380
need to know.
But meanwhile they're just making it up.

945
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:09,020
It's just a foul,
disgusting human being.

946
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,900
I'm with you.
My grandmother would have bought it,

947
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,340
hook,
line and sinker.

948
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,190
She believed it,
man.

949
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:18,980
We had a dude a dye in my grandmother's 
house.

950
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,260
There was a guy who,
um,

951
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,900
during,
um,

952
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,120
I think it was like the fifties or the 
sixties,

953
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,520
you know,
they were pretty poor and there was this

954
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:31,710
guy in the neighborhood who needed a 
place to live

955
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,280
and he would pay them to rent a room in 
their house.

956
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,800
Is Pretty common back in those days and 
you know,

957
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,260
sometimes we'd eat dinner with them and 
what have you.

958
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:45,620
And he died in his room one day and uh,
they believe that this guy was talking 

959
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:51,291
to them.
They believe this guy was in the house 

960
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:51,291
and that she would,
uh,

961
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:54,770
go up into the attic sometimes and he 
would be up there and she would see him 

962
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:54,770
and talk to them.
Oh,

963
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,770
freaked me the fuck out,
man.

964
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,450
It's very creepy.
Did you ever hear,

965
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,160
I'm not sure if I'm going to get her 
name right.

966
00:44:59,161 --> 00:45:01,950
I think it's Emily Rose.
Others that name now,

967
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,490
the youngest woman or girl to ever 
publish.

968
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:10,590
It's kind of relate to some of this 
hocus pocus stuff that we're talking 

969
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:11,040
about.
Youngest girl to ever publish a paper in

970
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:16,041
Jama,
Journal of the American Medical 

971
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:16,140
Association,
a very prestigious journal.

972
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,790
I think she was maybe nine or 10 or 11.
I discussed this in one of my books.

973
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:26,030
Um,
and basically as a great four or five a 

974
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,520
science project,
she wanted to explore touch therapy.

975
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,880
Gee,
are you familiar with windows?

976
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,390
So touch therapy is one of those 
quackery.

977
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,180
But I'm triggered right now by you 
saying,

978
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,290
right,
right.

979
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,530
Just triggered me.
Right,

980
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,600
right.
Uh,

981
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,660
so basically it's the touch healer has 
some sort of energy and in his or her 

982
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,280
hands that they can sort of levitate 
around your pain area,

983
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,700
like Reiki,
Reiki,

984
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,000
whatever.
Yeah.

985
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:59,060
Right.
And so she wanted to test whether those 

986
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,941
claims were true.
So she set up a extraordinarily simple 

987
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:06,500
experiment to test their abilities.
And so what basically she did is she 

988
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:12,051
would put out her hand and then they had
to determine whether it's her right 

989
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:13,050
hand.
In other words,

990
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:13,460
there's,
there's,

991
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,000
there's a,
there's a,

992
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:20,020
uh,
a barrier where they can't see which of 

993
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,170
her hands is out and they have the 
ability of touch.

994
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,200
They should be able to predict whether 
on the right or left,

995
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:30,201
this is where her hand is.
And of course they ended up doing worse 

996
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:30,240
than random.
In other words,

997
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,470
less than 50.
I mean,

998
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:34,350
you have one in two chance of just 
guessing randomly whether it's the right

999
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,190
or left.
Right?

1000
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,340
And she demonstrated that these touch 
healers,

1001
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,640
who supposedly are able to cure cancer 
by levitating their hand over areas are 

1002
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,381
not even able to predict whether the 
hand that's out is on the right or left.

1003
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:49,940
Right.
I mean,

1004
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,350
so imagine what an elegant experiment 
that is.

1005
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,090
And it was published in that journal 
now.

1006
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:58,320
What do you think those touch healers 
came back with as a rebuttal?

1007
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,430
Can you think of anything new other than
that?

1008
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,160
No,
they basically said that when you,

1009
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:10,430
when you set up these types of 
experiments in a laboratory that ends up

1010
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,040
wait for it affecting the energy fields.
And therefore by testing our abilities,

1011
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,790
you are ultimately removing our 
abilities.

1012
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,520
Therefore it's an unfalsifiable 
position.

1013
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,760
It's not science.
I have heard that expression.

1014
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:36,340
I've heard that thought of when people 
were talking about people who don't 

1015
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:37,820
believe in psychics.
Right?

1016
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,080
And that if you talk to a psychic but 
you don't believe in them,

1017
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,140
your negative energy,
the fears with their gift.

1018
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:45,400
Exactly,
exactly right.

1019
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,970
So how could you ever tested right?
Can that.

1020
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,100
That's why.
That's why all of these sort of quackery

1021
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:55,540
movements are part of the sort of non 
science epidemiology,

1022
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,740
right?
Destiny,

1023
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,300
right?
The idea of destiny.

1024
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,750
If I walk out of my house now and I get 
hit by a car,

1025
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,970
that was my destiny.
If I go ahead,

1026
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:04,680
oh no,
please go to.

1027
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,180
If I walk out of my house and I don't 
get hit by trucks,

1028
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,080
that was my destiny.
So what state of the world would have to

1029
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:14,740
happen for it,
for me to be able to test the destiny or

1030
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:15,210
not?
This thing,

1031
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:15,620
I can't.

1032
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,190
Anything that happens is my destiny,
right?

1033
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,080
So it's unfalsifiable.
You know,

1034
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:20,890
I have a,
uh,

1035
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,390
a little piece of Hocus pocus that I,
I don't,

1036
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,510
I don't necessarily believe,
but I,

1037
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:30,580
uh,
entertainment from time to time and that

1038
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:35,581
is synchronicity.
Like when you're discussing an object 

1039
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:39,481
and then something will come up,
whether it's on television or the news 

1040
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:40,720
that just perfectly fits into what 
you're talking about.

1041
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:41,500
And you're like,
well,

1042
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,730
how God damned convenient is this.
Like I was having a,

1043
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:47,020
um,
a text,

1044
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:52,140
a conversation with a friend of mine 
this morning and he lives on the east 

1045
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,921
coast and I live in the west coast.
We're going back and forth and he's 

1046
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:58,591
having health issues and he's going to 
talk to a doctor about probiotics and 

1047
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,160
while we're having this conversation,
I go downstairs and I'm about to work 

1048
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:10,411
out.
I turn on the television and good 

1049
00:49:10,411 --> 00:49:12,601
morning America is having a,
an expert discuss probiotics and how gut

1050
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:18,160
health can affect all sorts of various 
things including your mood,

1051
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:19,720
all sorts of various illnesses.

1052
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,720
And like literally at the same moment 
I'm having this text conversation with 

1053
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:29,731
my friend.
So I take a photo of the television and 

1054
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:29,731
I sent,
I sent it to him and like,

1055
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:32,260
how crazy is this?
Like we're talking about this and Bam,

1056
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,430
it's on tv like that.
Can I,

1057
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:36,610
they mystify that story.
Why would you want to fuck it up for me?

1058
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:41,560
Man would do apologies.
This is actually called the cell a bias.

1059
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,550
So for example,
if you say,

1060
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,050
uh,
you know,

1061
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,080
every time I get in the shower,
the phone rings,

1062
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,670
right?
Right.

1063
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,460
Habits me right now,
what?

1064
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,220
What are the events that you're not 
coding in your brain,

1065
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,170
so the other times the phone rang,
no locks on the phone can ring or cannot

1066
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,130
ring,
and you could get into the shower or not

1067
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,620
get into the shower.
So it's a two by two matrix.

1068
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,070
The brain is only coding the instances,
the cell a bias.

1069
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:08,440
One of the biopsies were the two events 
happened,

1070
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:12,040
the phone rings and I get in the shower.
The three other events.

1071
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,580
Your brain never codes because they're 
not events.

1072
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,050
Therefore you end up overestimating the 
likelihood of that event.

1073
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:21,640
Oh my God.
Every time the phone rings,

1074
00:50:21,641 --> 00:50:26,641
I'm in the shower,
so this is what's happening with that 

1075
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:26,641
probiotic story,
right?

1076
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:30,210
There's a million other times that you 
spoke him about something else and then 

1077
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:34,301
you turned on the TV,
but there wasn't to use your term 

1078
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:34,700
synchronicity,
but that one time where it happened,

1079
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:38,480
you code it as as something magical and 
mystical.

1080
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,170
No,
you're not.

1081
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,720
You don't seem very buying your fucking 
bullshit or all men.

1082
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,000
So you're sticking with your magical 
thinking.

1083
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:52,470
Say The universe is a all working 
together to sort of.

1084
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,560
That science stuff is overrated.
I hear a lot of it's bullshit,

1085
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,760
Bro.
Right here.

1086
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,540
A lot of it is guesswork.
They don't know what to do.

1087
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,350
I just think that it was a beautiful 
coincidence,

1088
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:08,370
but that's how I look at it.
And there's a series of these beautiful 

1089
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,801
coincidences that happen all the time 
when you're tuned in the vibe of the 

1090
00:51:11,801 --> 00:51:12,710
universe,
man.

1091
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:13,920
Wow,
whoa,

1092
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:17,110
whoa,
Whoa,

1093
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,920
whoa.
I need to recover from that.

1094
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,230
A lot of people believe that.
Right?

1095
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,430
Is that.
So that's a big one,

1096
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:27,431
isn't it?
The vibe of the universe at moving away 

1097
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:30,551
from spiritual death or do you want to 
talk about some real science or do you 

1098
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:30,551
want to join the uh,
no and absolutely.

1099
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:31,670
Yeah.
So man,

1100
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,610
I really believe that.

1101
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,980
I think it's fun.
I mean,

1102
00:51:33,981 --> 00:51:35,630
for people listening,
is he serious?

1103
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,920
No,
we're,

1104
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,690
we're joking around.
But um,

1105
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,460
it is weird when stuff like that happens
and you do wonder why do you familiar?

1106
00:51:43,461 --> 00:51:48,461
I'm sure you are with simulation theory.
Tell me a bit about it to see what you 

1107
00:51:48,461 --> 00:51:49,310
mean.
Simulation theory is the idea,

1108
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:52,280
and this is not just being bandied about
by Comedians,

1109
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:55,040
but by actual physicist who contemplate 
the,

1110
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,220
when you extrapolate the nature of 
technology and where we're at now and 

1111
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,271
what's possible today with Oculus rift 
and all these virtual reality programs 

1112
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:07,520
that are developing that are 
extraordinarily effective.

1113
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:12,521
I mean,
I haven't seen the newest version of 

1114
00:52:12,521 --> 00:52:12,530
oculus rift,
but apparently it's in four.

1115
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:13,460
K is,
are what?

1116
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:15,950
Immersive games,
not games.

1117
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,390
Um,
oculus rift,

1118
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:19,070
they,
they're going to apply at the games,

1119
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:24,071
but what oculus rift is a,
it's like a ski goggle thing that you 

1120
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:25,370
put on that is a virtual reality 
program,

1121
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:30,430
uh,
that runs while this is happening and a 

1122
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:33,641
lot of what they're doing when they're 
running these just recording these 

1123
00:52:33,641 --> 00:52:36,120
incredible scenarios where you,
uh,

1124
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,240
apparently they put cameras all over a 
person's body and they have them go 

1125
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,401
through these rooms and then they take 
all of the data from all of that and 

1126
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:46,850
then,
uh,

1127
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:50,360
put it into this program so that when 
you're wearing these goggles,

1128
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,750
you can look around up and down and 
there is data.

1129
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,950
That's what it looks like.
Oh,

1130
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,880
cool.
There is data for every single aspect of

1131
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:00,870
the room,
every single area of the room.

1132
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:05,871
So as you look left and right,
all that's been covered and it's all 

1133
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:09,251
computing,
so as computational power and video 

1134
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:14,351
cards and all these different things 
that can compute the visual images as 

1135
00:53:14,351 --> 00:53:17,621
they improve and get better and better.
It's gotten to the point now where it's 

1136
00:53:17,621 --> 00:53:20,831
four k,
four k is what this television right 

1137
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:20,960
here is,
which is the latest,

1138
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:24,740
greatest version of hd.
It's very high resolution,

1139
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:28,130
beautiful images.
And my friend Duncan put it on,

1140
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,880
try it out at one of these developer 
conferences and called me just screaming

1141
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:33,930
and raving.
He's like,

1142
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:36,510
this is bigger than the Internet.
This is bigger than the wheel.

1143
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:37,860
This is the biggest thing.
He's like,

1144
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,270
this is gonna fucking change everything.
Um,

1145
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,640
he walked into a room in this virtual 
reality demonstration and there was a 

1146
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,380
man playing the piano piano.

1147
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:52,580
What does that man playing the piano?
The Piano sounded more a more realistic.

1148
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:56,910
As he got closer to it,
it got louder.

1149
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,100
Um,
he could see the man playing it.

1150
00:53:59,101 --> 00:54:01,650
He would step to the side and see the 
man playing it,

1151
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,040
look over the top of the piano,
see the man playing,

1152
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,670
go underneath the piano and see the man 
playing.

1153
00:54:06,671 --> 00:54:08,790
He's like,
this is fucking crazy,

1154
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:11,850
and it really looks like there's a guy 
in front of you playing the piano,

1155
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,880
but nothing's happening.
The idea being that if that technology 

1156
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,321
exists today in 2015,
there is going to come a time whether 

1157
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:24,540
that time is 100 years from now or a 
thousand years from now where there will

1158
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:29,541
be an artificial reality that is 
indecipherable from the reality that we 

1159
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:32,610
live in right now from this touch,
feel,

1160
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,730
hear,
see reality,

1161
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:39,060
that we just all accept as real.

1162
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:44,690
That there's going to be something that 
is artificially created but is 

1163
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:48,330
indistinguishable from what we're 
experiencing and if that is true,

1164
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:52,260
how do we not know that we haven't 
already been in it?

1165
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:58,010
How do we not know?
Because if we're not talking about 

1166
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:58,010
Voodoo,
we're talking about technology and we're

1167
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:02,460
talking about pretty trackable stuff,
like if you follow Moore's law,

1168
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,440
if you follow the any of the 
technological laws of extrapolation from

1169
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:12,441
the point that we're at now,
to the point that they're projecting 

1170
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:12,441
just within five,
10,

1171
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:12,441
15,
20 years,

1172
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:15,180
they're talking about incredible.
So if you've seen magic leap,

1173
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:20,181
if you seen them.
I was going to say I haven't seen the 

1174
00:55:20,181 --> 00:55:22,611
matrix either,
but it sounds like that's sort of the 

1175
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:22,611
simpsons.
Yeah.

1176
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:22,611
Yeah.
Well it's similar along those lines.

1177
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:26,310
Matrix seemed like a total horseshit.
Just when it came out it seemed like,

1178
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:31,311
wow,
this is a cool science fiction movie 

1179
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:31,311
about some shit that's not real.

1180
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:31,311
Right.
I never could be real,

1181
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:36,410
but now the matrix looks closer and 
closer to reality with every passing 

1182
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:39,900
day,
with every passing year it looks like,

1183
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:44,901
wow,
it's inevitable whether it's 100 years 

1184
00:55:44,901 --> 00:55:47,181
from now or whatever,
they're going to be able to give you an 

1185
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:51,021
experience that is indistinguishable 
from this experience that we think is 

1186
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:51,021
real.
You know,

1187
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:55,671
my only sort of jumping point for him 
while he's talking about when I was a 

1188
00:55:55,671 --> 00:55:58,170
student in computer science and math,
I took artificial intelligence,

1189
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,200
but now this is going back to not to 
date myself,

1190
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,380
uh,
you know,

1191
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,320
the twenties,
1985,

1192
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:12,321
about 1984 85.
And at the time one of the things that 

1193
00:56:12,321 --> 00:56:14,130
we had learned in that in this course 
was.

1194
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,270
So do you know about how now there are 
computers that can easily match,

1195
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,210
uh,
the grandmasters and chest?

1196
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:23,680
Yes.
So at the time when I was in school,

1197
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,150
some of the early versions of those,
uh,

1198
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,600
computers,
uh,

1199
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:31,150
we're just about at the level of the 
grand masters.

1200
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,360
And so one of the assignments that we 
had to do in that course was to develop 

1201
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,950
an algorithm.
So if you look at the chest,

1202
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,980
a decision tree,
the number of nodes that it has is 

1203
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,290
something like,
I can't remember the exact moment.

1204
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:45,780
You could probably pull it out 
something.

1205
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:50,490
I tend to the 100 possibilities.
And so it will take you more than the,

1206
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:51,250
the,
the,

1207
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:56,251
the age of the universe if you want it 
to exhaustively search through every 

1208
00:56:56,251 --> 00:56:59,821
possible option to rather what you have 
to do is use some sort of search 

1209
00:56:59,821 --> 00:57:04,291
algorithm to prune out to weed out huge 
parts of the decision tree.

1210
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,760
You see what I'm saying?
So that way,

1211
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:11,850
this huge decision tree,
you only go through the parts that seem 

1212
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:11,850
promising.

1213
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:16,980
And so we had,
we didn't do it for chest with the 

1214
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,961
different other game,
but at that time I already had founded 

1215
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:18,961
almost mystical,
uh,

1216
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:23,311
the type of stuff that we were learning 
and ai to try to sort of model this 

1217
00:57:23,311 --> 00:57:27,121
artificial intelligence that could mimic
the capacities of a human grandmaster 

1218
00:57:27,121 --> 00:57:28,510
player.
And what you're talking about,

1219
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,220
of course,
as many generations ahead of that.

1220
00:57:30,221 --> 00:57:32,150
So incredible stuff.
Managing,

1221
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,180
managing generations ahead of that.
And again,

1222
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,580
you're talking about 30 years,
it's not that long.

1223
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,490
It's really not in terms of culture,
it's like if you went by,

1224
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:45,790
if 30 years went by in the 12 hundreds,
nothing will change.

1225
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,080
True.
Nothing.

1226
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:50,890
And 30 years today is almost an eternity
when it comes to technology.

1227
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,850
Well actually yesterday we were sitting 
at the beach in Laguna,

1228
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,940
my wife and I and the kids and uh,
I asked her and I,

1229
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,330
I wonder if you have an answer to this.

1230
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:03,430
I'm sure we could pull it up.
How many people today still use non 

1231
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:03,430
smartphones,
right?

1232
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,130
I mean,
I,

1233
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,710
I joined the fear but so probably you 
think like five percent.

1234
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,780
Um,
if I had to guess,

1235
00:58:10,781 --> 00:58:15,781
I'd bet it's less than that,
but it's about 10 or I bet it's a 

1236
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,260
rather.
Um,

1237
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,030
one percent.
No,

1238
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,160
I was going to say three.
But I would say,

1239
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:26,161
um,
I would bet that out of all the people 

1240
00:58:26,161 --> 00:58:29,440
that use cell phones on a regular basis,
yeah,

1241
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:34,470
I would say it's less than five percent.
I would say it's probably around three 

1242
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:34,470
or something like that.
Less than 10 for sure.

1243
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,620
What do you think,
Jamie?

1244
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,140
What would you guess?
Three?

1245
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:43,380
Like three percent if you like,
if you see people that are walking 

1246
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,770
around.
I'm trying to think.

1247
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,460
I mean,
last time I saw,

1248
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:50,500
I can't remember the last time that I 
saw somebody sort of flipping a phone.

1249
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,950
I think my mom has one still write text 
me.

1250
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,790
It's pretty obvious.
You're still like let her,

1251
00:58:55,810 --> 00:59:00,810
you choose you.
If you have an iphone you use you 

1252
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:03,010
instead of why are you.
You're lazy bitch.

1253
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,210
Just write why.
Oh,

1254
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,090
you.
Jesus Christ.

1255
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,570
I'm not going to agree with that 
sentiment,

1256
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:08,810
mother.
No,

1257
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,610
not my mom.
My mom has.

1258
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,160
She doesn't have a smart phone,
right?

1259
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,570
Least.
I don't think she does.

1260
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,580
Um,
what uh,

1261
00:59:15,581 --> 00:59:19,240
what is the percentage Jamie percentage 
of people that don't use smartphone?

1262
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,610
Just all.
I can find this.

1263
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,710
There's two thirds of American adults 
have a smartphone.

1264
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,350
So I guess it'd be that one third don't.
So I don't know if that's a fit.

1265
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:28,760
Yeah.
What does that mean though?

1266
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:32,870
Was that kind of follows?
A lot of them may not have any phones.

1267
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,770
They're fucking animals.
If you're living in 2015,

1268
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,440
you don't have a cell phone,
you're some fucking barbarian creature.

1269
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,810
That doesn't make any sense.
I've got A.

1270
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:46,870
I've got a good jumping point from 
because we were talking about 

1271
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,881
innovations.
You ready for this birth order and 

1272
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:52,241
innovations birth order,
your birth order as far as like where 

1273
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:53,000
you were born,
right?

1274
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:54,440
So you ready for this?
First,

1275
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:59,441
I'll give you the background of that 
story and then I'll tell you about some 

1276
00:59:59,441 --> 00:59:59,441
research that we did in a consumer 
context.

1277
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,550
So there's this gentleman by the name of
Frank Salloway.

1278
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,400
He's a historian of science and a huge 
Darwin supporter.

1279
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,820
He wrote a book in Nineteen Ninety six,
highly recommended called born to rebel 

1280
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:13,780
where he looked at the 28 most radical 
scientific innovations and the history 

1281
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:16,250
of human thought.
Okay.

1282
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,370
The reason for 28,
there's nothing magical about number 28.

1283
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,550
There was some criterion by which 
something got into that list or not.

1284
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:27,940
So he looked at the 28th most radical 
scientific innovation theory of 

1285
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:27,940
evolution would be one,
right?

1286
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:33,070
Something that really changed our 
understanding of the world and then he 

1287
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:37,301
looked at the birth order through 
historical records of either the people 

1288
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:41,630
who espouse the theory or those who were
the staunchest,

1289
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,510
the tractors,
opponents to the theory.

1290
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:49,010
And what he found is that the later 
borns,

1291
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:54,430
we're much more likely to be the ones to
espouse the radical scientific 

1292
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:54,430
innovations.
Wow.

1293
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,030
Now,
I'll explain in a second why,

1294
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:59,240
uh,
so he argued basically that when a child

1295
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:04,241
is born,
the first sort of adaptive problem that 

1296
01:01:04,241 --> 01:01:07,800
he has to solve is how to maximize 
parental investment to,

1297
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:08,380
to,
to,

1298
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:13,470
to himself or herself.
And the way you do that is by occupying 

1299
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,560
a unique niche in the eyes of your 
parents.

1300
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,080
So if your firstborn,
uh,

1301
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,450
there are no other niches that have been
occupied.

1302
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:25,451
So for example,
in each would be I want to be a good 

1303
01:01:25,451 --> 01:01:25,451
boy.

1304
01:01:25,451 --> 01:01:25,451
I want to be a rebel would be another 
niche,

1305
01:01:25,451 --> 01:01:30,220
right?
So that he called this Darwinian 

1306
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:30,220
partitioning niche hypothesis,
right?

1307
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:30,220
So it's,
it's,

1308
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,000
it's a positioning proposition,
right?

1309
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,900
How do I position myself to be maximally
different from all the other children?

1310
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,490
So the first,
the first,

1311
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:39,530
uh,
born has nobody,

1312
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,980
all the niches are available as you go 
down the cip ship,

1313
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,130
there are fewer and fewer niches that 
are available.

1314
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:51,370
This forces later barns to be more out 
of the box thinkers to be more 

1315
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:53,210
malleable,
to be less rigid,

1316
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,250
to be less conforming.
And,

1317
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,200
and the data was actually quite 
astonishing.

1318
01:01:57,201 --> 01:02:00,620
So for 23 out of the 28th radical 
scientific innovations,

1319
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,660
that's exactly what he found.
Incidentally.

1320
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:06,230
Do you want to guess what the 
Godfather's birth orders last?

1321
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:09,500
Thank you.
Fourth of four.

1322
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:12,380
That's why I always said expect great 
things from the Godfather.

1323
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:13,790
It's meant to be.
But,

1324
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:14,720
but anyways,
so,

1325
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:18,290
so we took this idea and we applied it 
to,

1326
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,070
since we were talking about adoption

1327
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,780
of phones and cell phones,
smart phones,

1328
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,970
we applied it to the context of are you 
a product innovator?

1329
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:29,400
Jus adopt something early or late and so
on.

1330
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,040
And we exactly replicated celebrates 
findings.

1331
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:35,130
Firstborns were much more conforming 
later.

1332
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:38,190
Bourns were much more innovative in the 
product context.

1333
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:43,191
So we took the idea of way and applied 
in a consumer context that actually 

1334
01:02:43,191 --> 01:02:47,481
makes a ton of sense.
Another thing I think could possibly be 

1335
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:51,860
a consideration is that when you're 
younger you get fucked with by your 

1336
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,170
older brothers and sisters because they 
can,

1337
01:02:55,171 --> 01:03:00,171
because they're tired of taking shit 
from the parents and you're forced to 

1338
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:00,750
think outside the box because you got to
work around.

1339
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:04,710
Those fuckers are constantly trying to 
mess your game up.

1340
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:08,610
At every point in turn they cheat,
they make up rules.

1341
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,760
They tell you what mom said,
well mom didn't really say anything yet.

1342
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,400
You get in trouble the last born now,
first hot.

1343
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:15,750
Okay.
I know devious.

1344
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:20,751
I don't do that.
You're not supposed to have all these 

1345
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:20,751
statues as the firstborn.
There was no.

1346
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:22,270
Well,
only in only in the conforming sense.

1347
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:28,340
On the other hand,
you could argue that maybe within your 

1348
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:28,340
social media this is conforming,
right?

1349
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:28,980
So it could be.
Yeah.

1350
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:31,580
Or you just liked tattoos or he just 
liked that it was.

1351
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,070
And you're not scared of pain.
Right?

1352
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,450
I think that's more likely,
right?

1353
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:40,550
Oh yeah.
I think it's fascinating when you look 

1354
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,750
at what causes someone to be innovative 
and what causes someone mean.

1355
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,790
It's one of the things that I've thought
of as a parent and um,

1356
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
many my friends have the same issue.
It's all my interesting friends came 

1357
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,831
from fucked up childhoods.
All my interesting friends had parents 

1358
01:03:57,831 --> 01:04:01,131
that were a mess and they all childhood 
was chaos and it forced them to develop 

1359
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:03,660
a unique character,
right?

1360
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,900
All of them.
And I'm trying my best to make my 

1361
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,620
children's lives as easy and comfortable
as possible.

1362
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:15,890
But in doing so,
am I hampering them right hampering 

1363
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,460
their development and some sort of a 
whiteboard or around them,

1364
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,770
around them,
smack on every now and then just to keep

1365
01:04:19,771 --> 01:04:21,800
it,
push them my way.

1366
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:25,350
No,
just I think that there's other ways,

1367
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:30,351
and this is my theory,
there's other ways to encourage 

1368
01:04:30,351 --> 01:04:31,950
innovation or creativity or to pursue 
your passions and dreams.

1369
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,010
And one of the things that I'm also 
quite shocked at,

1370
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:40,320
um,
with having children is how absolutely,

1371
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:44,670
absolutely unique.
They are right out of the box in a happy

1372
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:48,540
environment with no stress,
no financial issues.

1373
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:53,550
No,
there's no arguing and screaming from 

1374
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:57,231
the parents,
like what is it about kids had to those 

1375
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:58,320
right out of the vagina are just a 
totally different person,

1376
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:00,510
like from day one made from each other.

1377
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:02,460
Yes.
So different.

1378
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So different.
That speaks to the fact that there are 

1379
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,750
an innate elements to our personhood,
right?

1380
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:11,970
Or astrology.
Astrology,

1381
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:12,660
yes.
Yes.

1382
01:05:12,661 --> 01:05:14,340
Maybe that's real.
That's what it may be.

1383
01:05:14,341 --> 01:05:17,380
You need to just come over to the 
mystical side a a little bit,

1384
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,660
Mr.
Simon to do that.

1385
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,030
Have you ever talked to someone who can 
read those?

1386
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,770
My wild fennel aunt.
Oh really?

1387
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,470
What?
You already forgot what we spoke about?

1388
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,150
No,
but can she read those charts?

1389
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:29,500
No,
she could read the.

1390
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,390
This,
the,

1391
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,470
the coffee stains.
No,

1392
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:36,150
but that's nonsense.
That's talks about astrological stuff.

1393
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:41,410
Yeah.
You know those people that can read 

1394
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:43,351
those things were mercury's in 
retrograde and they know we're Pluto is 

1395
01:05:43,351 --> 01:05:47,311
the time your dad came and your mom.
I think I can figure that stuff out on 

1396
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:50,260
hung around in those circles,
so unfortunately not enough.

1397
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,500
Apparently there are people that are 
absolutely consumed by the Uber Complex 

1398
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:00,070
aspects of astrology,
like real astrology now,

1399
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:02,530
like the stuff that you get in your 
Sunday paper,

1400
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,520
Oh,
I'm a Leo,

1401
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:06,700
so today's a good day to take a shit or 
whatever the hell it would be.

1402
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,350
Right.
All those really random,

1403
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:13,950
but apparently there's just volumes of 
books written on constellations and the 

1404
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:20,641
alignment of these constellations and 
where the stars are at any particular 

1405
01:06:20,641 --> 01:06:22,750
time and it's dependent upon what time 
of year,

1406
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:27,610
what time of day do you buy into that in
any way,

1407
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:32,611
shape or form?
Because there are a lot of people that 

1408
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:34,501
believe that Leo's have a very distinct 
personality and have distinct 

1409
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:37,360
personality traits that are trackable.
I don't care about Leo's.

1410
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:38,850
I'm libra telling me about.
I don't know,

1411
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,920
but I'm Aaliyah.
I don't even understand the good 

1412
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:43,990
looking.
Very charismatic.

1413
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:45,520
Very brilliant.
What happened to you?

1414
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,460
I know I hired.
That's the outlier.

1415
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:51,490
I'm the black sheep.
Wait a minute.

1416
01:06:51,491 --> 01:06:53,940
Black sheep.
That's triggering tracy.

1417
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:54,710
Yes.
You.

1418
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,600
Then you said trigger,
which is even more of a trigger,

1419
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,650
right?
Oh my God.

1420
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:01,510
I'm so triggered.
I didn't even know what to do.

1421
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,960
Here's another one that I wanted to 
bring up with you about that trigger 

1422
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,590
ship because it was something that you 
were helping about.

1423
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,250
You sent me and I went,
wow,

1424
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,980
we tweeted it.
Oh my God.

1425
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:13,060
It was.
It was about.

1426
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,420
I was so angry.
The woman who was a professor or Kipnis.

1427
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:18,480
Yes.
Explained the story because I'm.

1428
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:23,580
I'm searching.
So basically the idea is that there's 

1429
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:23,580
all these movements about,
you know,

1430
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:27,790
how horrifyingly violent campuses are in
terms of sexual violence,

1431
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:32,110
which is of course not true.
And she had written an article where she

1432
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:35,290
was criticizing that position,
sort of the lunacy,

1433
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,630
the hysteria involved with that 
narrative,

1434
01:07:37,631 --> 01:07:42,631
right.
One out of every five women will be 

1435
01:07:42,631 --> 01:07:42,631
raped on canvas,
which is complete nonsense,

1436
01:07:42,631 --> 01:07:43,180
isn't nonsense.
What,

1437
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,470
what,
what are the actual numbers?

1438
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:46,150
So I don't,
I haven't studied it carefully,

1439
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:47,350
but I thought that was true.

1440
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,170
Well,
because it depends how you defined.

1441
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:55,350
Right?
So I think if you look at them exactly 

1442
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:55,350
right.
Right.

1443
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:55,350
So the,
so exactly the male,

1444
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,730
because the male gaze is a form of 
visual rape.

1445
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,320
That's why,
by the way,

1446
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,180
that's why I've written an article about
this.

1447
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,940
You should check it out.
Uh,

1448
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:08,540
the bikini is patriarchal oppression.
While the Burka is liberating.

1449
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,150
This is western feminists who argue this
and they argue this because.

1450
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,160
Exactly using the argument of the male 
gaze,

1451
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,440
since the Burka liberates women from the
male gaze and the bikini draws the male 

1452
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,200
gaze,
the bikini is bad.

1453
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:26,420
The burke as good.
What is the grape smuggler?

1454
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:28,850
What's the grid smarter?
That's where men were a little,

1455
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:33,870
little,
tiny little John Claude van Damme 

1456
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,700
underwear.
Things that people were like in France 

1457
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:36,700
and stuff,
you know,

1458
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,730
it was a little bikini that,
that reference went over my head.

1459
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,280
Oh,
you mean like this?

1460
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,530
The little speedos?
Yeah.

1461
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,420
Speedos,
but.

1462
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:45,460
Well,
women don't respond to the visual 

1463
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:45,460
stimuli the way that men do too.
Where?

1464
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:46,340
Oh,
you say that.

1465
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:48,270
Evolutionary psychology.
Come on.

1466
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:51,410
Listen,
when girls see channing tatum doing that

1467
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:54,020
Magic Mike Shit,
dancing around on stage,

1468
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:56,090
you tell me the not responding to visual
stimuli.

1469
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:59,750
Get the fuck.
I hear a bunch of convenient bullshit by

1470
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:02,900
guys who have shitty bodies.
We don't want to think their girlfriends

1471
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:07,901
drooling a channing tatum with his 
little fucking daisy dukes on or 

1472
01:09:07,901 --> 01:09:08,420
whatever.
He's wearing his construction,

1473
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:13,680
so you actually think that is in that 
men and women are indistinguishable in 

1474
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,520
the manner by which they respond to.
It didn't say that.

1475
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:18,800
I didn't say that,
but they absolutely respond visually.

1476
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:23,750
That's the reason why men want to have 
six packs wise because girls get excited

1477
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:25,040
by it.
It's very simple.

1478
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,430
I just don't think it's the same sort of
stem.

1479
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:32,480
I think there's there's pursuit stimuli 
where a guy will see a girl who's got a 

1480
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,190
hot bag into bikini and go,
oh Jesus,

1481
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,190
and they literally go running up to them
to try to talk to them.

1482
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:42,191
Yes.
I don't think that same thing happens 

1483
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:43,310
with females to males as much,
but the idea,

1484
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:46,400
but I think that's also just gender 
roles,

1485
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:49,400
has deal with testosterone,
has to deal with many,

1486
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:50,910
many things.
Culture,

1487
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:55,310
the normal behavior as far as male,
female behavior.

1488
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:58,170
I think both sexes,
when they look at each other,

1489
01:09:58,171 --> 01:10:03,171
are looking for a important cues that 
are relevant to the American market.

1490
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,450
So you're absolutely right that women 
are looking,

1491
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:10,451
for example,
they like tight buttocks because that 

1492
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:13,210
sends an important signal for size and 
shape of the sperm point nine waist to 

1493
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:15,920
hip ratio on a mass of the swimmers.

1494
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:19,070
The male swimmers build is very have 
wide shoulders,

1495
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,160
thin waist.
So,

1496
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:23,810
so I'm not suggesting that women don't 
respond to visual cues,

1497
01:10:23,811 --> 01:10:26,510
but they certainly don't respond nearly 
as much as men.

1498
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,290
I think they respond probably in an 
equal,

1499
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:34,490
uh,
within equal intensity but not act in an

1500
01:10:34,491 --> 01:10:37,250
equal intensity and certainly not act in
a threatening way.

1501
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:42,460
And that's where the male gaze comes in.
So why aren't there a million a male 

1502
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,660
stripper shops targeting heterosexual 
women?

1503
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:46,250
You should get into that market like a 
lot of.

1504
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:51,260
Well,
there is a lot of male strip shows and 

1505
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,640
in fact in vegas,
those are the things that they advertise

1506
01:10:52,641 --> 01:10:57,641
the airport when you go there,
the thunder down under and all this 

1507
01:10:57,641 --> 01:11:00,521
jazz.
Bunch of guys with their shirts off 

1508
01:11:00,521 --> 01:11:02,500
sweaty,
but women don't feel comfortable going 

1509
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:02,750
into those environments the way men feel
comfortable.

1510
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:07,751
So they go in these packs of wild 
estrogen creatures and they scream and 

1511
01:11:11,331 --> 01:11:16,331
yell.
I used to have a bit about it that it's 

1512
01:11:16,331 --> 01:11:16,331
a totally that ladies'

1513
01:11:16,331 --> 01:11:19,010
night out.
It's a totally different kind of 

1514
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:19,980
experience when they go leave,
they scream and cheer and yell.

1515
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:23,070
Where guys sit there and don't say much 
of anything.

1516
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:26,850
He just kind of stare like that speaks 
predatory.

1517
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:29,310
Exactly.
There's definitely a difference.

1518
01:11:29,311 --> 01:11:31,500
It's sisterhood of the pants or 
whatever.

1519
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:33,270
That right there.
They're banding together,

1520
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:38,320
right?
I just think that women don't have the 

1521
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,711
correct outlet,
which is why when a book like 50 shades 

1522
01:11:39,711 --> 01:11:40,110
of grey comes out,
they all go fucking bananas.

1523
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:43,950
Like finally we've got a channel to to 
funnel.

1524
01:11:43,951 --> 01:11:46,570
All of our sex urge is through right 
now.

1525
01:11:46,571 --> 01:11:49,320
You see them read their reading porn on 
planes.

1526
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,380
You're passing by on planes.
They're reading gag porn.

1527
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,070
Well,
by the way,

1528
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,670
if you want to understand male versus 
female sexuality,

1529
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,360
I don't you do,
but please,

1530
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:01,200
if you.
If you want to understand male sexuality

1531
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:04,080
than you do a content analysis of 
pornography.

1532
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:06,390
If you want to understand female 
sexuality,

1533
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,580
you do a content analysis of romance 
novels.

1534
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:09,350
It's true,
right?

1535
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:14,540
So if you look at the archetype of the,
and that's going to speak to your six 

1536
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:15,190
back about the pretty guy.
Uh,

1537
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:18,030
if you look at the archetype of the male
hero in romance novels,

1538
01:12:18,031 --> 01:12:20,610
irrespective of which culture the 
romance novel is written,

1539
01:12:20,611 --> 01:12:24,240
and it's going to be Romania or Egypt or
your Newport beach,

1540
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:27,120
he's always the same guy.
He's a tall guy.

1541
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:29,700
He's got a six pack.
He's account meaning,

1542
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:31,770
right?
He's also a neurosurgeon.

1543
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:35,850
He wrestles alligators on his six back.
He's reckless.

1544
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,910
He's risky,
but only to be tamed by the love of that

1545
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,900
one woman.
Right?

1546
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,320
So I've already told you about the every
single archetype that you've,

1547
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:45,780
I mean the same archetype and every 
romance novel.

1548
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:51,500
The reason why the archetype is there is
because it exactly caters to women's 

1549
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:51,690
fantasies.

1550
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,960
And sometimes he's like half a chick.
Like he's got long hair and like very 

1551
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,240
chique like behavior.
He wears,

1552
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:05,241
like flowing very sheer shirts,
which no guy in their right mind would 

1553
01:13:05,241 --> 01:13:10,001
ever wear.
And if you did where women would mock 

1554
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:10,001
you,
right?

1555
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:10,001
Right.
If you were,

1556
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:12,430
if you have long flowing fabio hair and 
you had like a,

1557
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:17,431
a,
like a blouse on and you went out to a 

1558
01:13:17,431 --> 01:13:17,431
nightclub,
people go with a fuck is wrong with that

1559
01:13:17,431 --> 01:13:18,540
guy.
But in a romance novel,

1560
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:19,640
you're on the cover baby.
Well,

1561
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,070
because you have to also send out some 
cues of sensitivity,

1562
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:24,600
right?
Is that what that is?

1563
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:27,660
It's an artistic.
It's a bit sensitive.

1564
01:13:27,661 --> 01:13:29,940
So.
So guess it's just not a real person,

1565
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:34,010
just like the vampires when there's a 
reason why women fell in love with those

1566
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,300
fucking stupid vampires.
Like why?

1567
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:41,301
Why is that?
Vampires that don't even burn up in the 

1568
01:13:41,301 --> 01:13:44,001
sun.
They sparkle like what was all that 

1569
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:44,001
about?
Um,

1570
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:44,001
I dunno.
Those narratives on dairy,

1571
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:44,950
you twilight,
goddammit.

1572
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:46,160
I don't watch that stuff.
Sorry.

1573
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:51,180
New.
I'm too busy watching Lionel Messi a 

1574
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:51,180
right,
right,

1575
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:51,180
right.
Well,

1576
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,940
those books sold fucking millions of the
vampire ones.

1577
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:56,970
Yes.
Millions and millions of copies.

1578
01:13:56,971 --> 01:14:01,971
And they were essentially a form of 
romance porn vampire bullshit for 

1579
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,140
chicks.
And again,

1580
01:14:04,141 --> 01:14:07,050
these men in these books,
these vampires,

1581
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,840
they didn't exist.
Not only did they not exist,

1582
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,100
they didn't make sense.
Like the main

1583
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,390
one,
that one that uh,

1584
01:14:13,391 --> 01:14:14,310
you know,
there's Christian,

1585
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,650
whatever the hell her name was and ed,
whatever the fuck his name is rob,

1586
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:22,740
whatever the fuck his name.
I don't know any of those that carry 

1587
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:25,231
out.
The guy was supposed to bleed like 90 

1588
01:14:25,231 --> 01:14:25,870
years old or something like that.
He got,

1589
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:30,580
he got like in the Spanish plague is 
when he died and that's when it became a

1590
01:14:30,581 --> 01:14:35,581
vampire,
but he has to still go to high school 

1591
01:14:35,581 --> 01:14:35,581
because when it became a vampire he was 
like 17,

1592
01:14:35,581 --> 01:14:38,710
so he has to show up and go to high 
school with all normal people.

1593
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:43,860
But he goes to high school in the 
Pacific northwest because it's never 

1594
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:43,860
sunny out.
So he doesn't glitter.

1595
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:46,180
It's one of the dumbest fucking books of
all time.

1596
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:47,830
Why don't you get watch that stuff?
Well,

1597
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:50,560
I didn't talk.
Know a lot about a lot about it.

1598
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,610
I've watched little moments of it before
I panicked and shut it off.

1599
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,020
Right.
I actually did watch one of them,

1600
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:59,630
I think I watched the second one anyway,
point being watched.

1601
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:00,770
The one with.
They became Werewolf's.

1602
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,680
It was fucking so stupid.
It made me mad.

1603
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:08,160
But point being like,
this guy is 90 fucking years old and 

1604
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,670
he's hanging around with 17 year old.
That guy's an asshole,

1605
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,960
right?
He's pretending to be 17.

1606
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,740
He falls in love with the 17 year old 
navy and had sex with her eventually,

1607
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:17,670
which is pedophilia and then we're 
really pedal.

1608
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:20,680
Not just pedophilia but like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1609
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:25,681
What do you have in common?
You've been around for 90 years and 

1610
01:15:25,681 --> 01:15:26,920
you've got something in common with this
girl who's 17 years old.

1611
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:32,090
It's fucking ridiculous.
No more than 90 years really because in 

1612
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:32,410
the 19 twenties or whatever the hell it 
was,

1613
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:35,680
we're assuming that he was 17 years old 
then,

1614
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,420
so he's more than 100 years old.

1615
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,440
It's,
it's the dumbest fucking book of all 

1616
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:42,440
time,
but it was huge.

1617
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,400
Women loved it and it didn't represent a
real person and he represented the exact

1618
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:49,900
opposite of a real person.
Like what guys like actually exists,

1619
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,090
guys like sluts.
Okay.

1620
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,680
And those are real.
And I,

1621
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:55,780
when I say slots,
it was all due respect.

1622
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,300
I'm not slut shaming,
which is by the way another trigger.

1623
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,140
Yes.
Don't slut.

1624
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:04,141
Shame is because then you're,
you're mocking girls for their ability 

1625
01:16:04,141 --> 01:16:04,900
to choose their sexual partners as part 
of the patriarchy.

1626
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,220
Yes.
Yes it is,

1627
01:16:06,221 --> 01:16:07,810
right?
Yes.

1628
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:11,020
Yes.
I'm strongly against the patriarchy.

1629
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,600
Are you going to get in trouble for this
podcast and the way he's not at all.

1630
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:18,630
Last time you didn't know.
No one said anything and I mean some 

1631
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:21,781
trolls.
Do they usually it was a Jew that you 

1632
01:16:21,781 --> 01:16:25,470
choose.
You Ju Ju got mad at you for being 

1633
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:25,470
Jewish.

1634
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:25,760
Julie's as Zionists shields.
June.

1635
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:31,320
Uh,
that's usually the extent of the 

1636
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:31,320
negative stuff.
I've done a damn sign.

1637
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,441
The shills yeah.
Let's go back to your friend Laura 

1638
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:37,000
Kipnis did say her name,
Kiss Kiss,

1639
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Kiss Laura Kipnis.
She is a professor at northwestern 

1640
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:42,000
university.
So she wrote this essay,

1641
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,540
a chronicle of higher education.
And in the article in the Atlantic it 

1642
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,770
brings it up describing a new campus 
politics of sexual paranoia.

1643
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:53,190
And she was then subject to a long 
investigation after students who were 

1644
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:57,330
offended by the articles and by a tweet 
that she sent file filed a chapter nine 

1645
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:00,100
complaint against her.
Now what does that mean?

1646
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,440
I think it's that,
uh,

1647
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:06,480
you know,
women should have equal access to 

1648
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:06,480
education and so on.
I'd be in a safe,

1649
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,240
you know,
like she was somehow suppressing.

1650
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,100
Well because by her,
by

1651
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,140
her,
uh,

1652
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:16,390
making light of the endemic sexual 
violence on campus and quotes,

1653
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:23,500
she was condoning it and therefore she 
was making all these women feel unsafe 

1654
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:28,070
and unwelcomed and threatened on campus.
And so two students,

1655
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,230
uh,
started that process.

1656
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,020
Now I don't know the details.
I mean I'm not a constitutional lawyer,

1657
01:17:33,021 --> 01:17:36,200
but basically once sort of the,
the complaint is filed,

1658
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:41,770
then sort of the train starts and it 
becomes this orwellian thing that that's

1659
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,130
just,
I mean it's just,

1660
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,570
it's,
it's a complete nightmare.

1661
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:49,840
And so I read that stuff and I just got 
so angry and I spent pretty much that 

1662
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,730
whole day rallying up the forces in your
kind enough to treat it and just,

1663
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,160
you know,
your tweet got me something like 100,000

1664
01:17:55,161 --> 01:17:56,220
views.
Uh,

1665
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:59,570
and then I communicated with her because
I wanted to send her a signal that,

1666
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,600
you know,
there are some of us that still have to 

1667
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:04,600
stickler fortitude that are willing to.
I mean,

1668
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,500
in academia you shouldn't even say

1669
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:10,590
gesticulate trigger that it's for men.
Why counterparts compatriot.

1670
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:12,250
Sure.
Uh,

1671
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,530
and,
and so,

1672
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,950
you know,
I just wanted to,

1673
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:17,150
to tell her that,
uh,

1674
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,120
some of us were supporting her.
Yeah.

1675
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:21,760
I read it and I thought it was really 
serving.

1676
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:24,940
I thought it was really disturbing 
because it just seems so common.

1677
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:30,210
That's the most disturbing aspect.
There was not some unusual occurrence 

1678
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,660
where kids are freaking out about 
nothing and overreacting.

1679
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,610
Where you could look at it like,
what is this?

1680
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:34,930
It's like,
oh,

1681
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,340
this again,
you know.

1682
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:37,900
And that's what bugs me the most about 
it.

1683
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:38,770
It's this,
again,

1684
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:43,980
it's the idea that looking at data and 
looking at the realities of the climate 

1685
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:48,700
of free speech on these campuses and how
it's oppressed and it's not free speech,

1686
01:18:48,701 --> 01:18:52,690
you are free to think as they do know 
and if you don't think as they do,

1687
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:53,590
you're not free.

1688
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:54,900
That's right.
You know,

1689
01:18:56,050 --> 01:19:00,100
this issue of how cowardly most 
academics have become.

1690
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:00,940
And I,
and I say this,

1691
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:03,190
realizing that I'm going to piss off 
many of my colleagues.

1692
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,520
I'm astonished how academics who are in 
the business of engaging in public 

1693
01:19:09,281 --> 01:19:13,810
discourse are so tepid because they've 
been silenced and to fear.

1694
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,860
And I mean,
I see it in many,

1695
01:19:14,861 --> 01:19:19,861
many different ways,
but I'll just share one example which I 

1696
01:19:19,861 --> 01:19:21,150
think I shared in another show recently.
So if I put up a,

1697
01:19:21,151 --> 01:19:23,230
a,
a clip on facebook,

1698
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:27,340
have a Iraqi astronomer who was arguing 
that,

1699
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:32,490
uh,
in the Koran it says that the earth is 

1700
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:32,490
flat and it's clear that the earth is 
flat.

1701
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:37,320
Okay?
So I shared that clip to demonstrate 

1702
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:37,320
sort of the lunacy that,
uh,

1703
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:42,210
you know,
religious dogma I can have on an 

1704
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,230
otherwise supposedly intelligent person.
I mean Iraqi astronomer now,

1705
01:19:44,231 --> 01:19:48,460
what do you think the reaction was of 
Islamophobia?

1706
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:52,330
Zionist asshole.
He's allowed to have those thoughts.

1707
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,600
He's part of a suppressed culture,
right?

1708
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:57,250
So she didn't,
she didn't have the courage to tackle me

1709
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:02,251
that way,
but she wrote on my publicly not 

1710
01:20:02,251 --> 01:20:02,251
privately,
uh,

1711
01:20:02,251 --> 01:20:06,301
this wasn't academic white woman from 
California who's written with guilt and 

1712
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,610
hate her in a.
She wrote to me saying,

1713
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,290
you know,
don't you think that,

1714
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,510
you know,
it's bad of you to be sharing this,

1715
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:15,000
don't you think it's bad that you're 
sort of stigmatizing them?

1716
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,520
So step for a second and think about 
what this means,

1717
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:18,870
right?
This scientist,

1718
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:23,871
colleague of mine was not offended that 
a fellow scientists would actually hold 

1719
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:27,630
such a astonishingly false position.
Right?

1720
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:30,450
He's a member of the flat Earth Society.
Rather,

1721
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,630
she was offended that I would point to 
his lunacy.

1722
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:38,960
So that I think that small anecdote 
really captures the culture of fear that

1723
01:20:39,991 --> 01:20:42,300
you see on campuses.
And in a sense,

1724
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:44,100
if I can sort of toot my own horn,
I'm,

1725
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:49,101
I'm really a very rare breed,
sort of the guy who walks around not 

1726
01:20:49,101 --> 01:20:52,200
caring a saying it as it is,
because that's my personality.

1727
01:20:52,201 --> 01:20:53,430
I can't be anything else,

1728
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:58,850
but you also are a very open minded guy 
and so when it comes down to like the 

1729
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:04,431
core values of these people promote,
whether it is a lack of racial 

1730
01:21:05,311 --> 01:21:10,311
insensitivity or racial stereotyping,
gender issues,

1731
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:15,090
whether it's sexism or homophobia,
you're,

1732
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,390
you're on the liberal side of all that 
stuff.

1733
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:20,310
But so you're.
So you're essentially a liberal,

1734
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,940
right?

1735
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:26,290
If I can say I'm a true liberal,
not the liberals that exist today 

1736
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:29,150
because the liberals have today as our 
common friend,

1737
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:31,120
Sam Harris and Ayaan Hirsi Ali have 
said,

1738
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:36,200
have a huge blind spot when it comes to 
certain issues where they fall really on

1739
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:41,201
the wrong side of the issue.
So a true liberal is one who doesn't 

1740
01:21:41,201 --> 01:21:44,711
Miss Ward,
who doesn't fall prey to cultural and 

1741
01:21:44,711 --> 01:21:44,711
moral relativism.
Who doesn't say,

1742
01:21:44,711 --> 01:21:49,541
well,
who are we to judge the cutting off of 

1743
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:49,541
Clarissa's of women?
That's their culture,

1744
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:50,840
right?
So that's a true liberal,

1745
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:52,790
so not a true liberal.
They're not,

1746
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,080
they're fake liberals.
Well,

1747
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:58,720
I think what they're doing is they're 
subscribing to the current trend of,

1748
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,400
of discourse.
Right.

1749
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:03,710
And the current trend of discourse is 
anything Islamic,

1750
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:04,880
leave it alone.
Yes.

1751
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:07,310
And uh,
I think a lot of that's being a pussy.

1752
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:08,360
Yeah,
I really do.

1753
01:22:08,361 --> 01:22:10,910
I think a lot of that is cowardice.
They're afraid of backlash.

1754
01:22:10,911 --> 01:22:15,911
They're afraid of a label.
Islamophobia is a very strange label 

1755
01:22:15,911 --> 01:22:19,580
because there's no Christian have phobia
and even antisemetic,

1756
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:21,100
you know,
there,

1757
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:26,340
there's a certain amount of antisemetic,
a logic and thinking that is promoted in

1758
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:31,280
certain Islamic cultures that's ignored 
as well.

1759
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:36,640
So you can,
you can get away with that in certain 

1760
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:36,640
ways.
Like,

1761
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,461
did you see that video of the guy that 
was walking through Paris dressed in a 

1762
01:22:39,461 --> 01:22:39,470
Jewish way?
Yes.

1763
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:41,630
Whoa.
Was that fucking disturbing?

1764
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:42,490
If,
uh,

1765
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:44,390
if you haven't seen it,
it is.

1766
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:49,590
It's just showing how openly in,
in the most sickening way openly anti 

1767
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:57,060
Jewish.
So many people are in,

1768
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,250
in Paris,

1769
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,280
by the way.
I should make it clear.

1770
01:23:00,281 --> 01:23:02,140
And of course now there'll be the hate 
comments.

1771
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:04,540
Uh,
it's not anti Israel,

1772
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,110
right?
It's,

1773
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:07,360
yes,
it's anti Jewish.

1774
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:08,980
It's antisemitic.
One hundred percent.

1775
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:12,410
I don't like the term symmetric because 
some medic is like some many people.

1776
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:15,010
It's represents a lot of people that 
aren't Jewish.

1777
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,200
It's anti Jewish,
right?

1778
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,870
I mean,
although the term is understood,

1779
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,210
typically symmetric means it's 
anonymous,

1780
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:26,080
but your point is well taken.
Why is his antisemitic?

1781
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:28,840
Because there's a lot of Semitic 
cultures that aren't Jewish.

1782
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:34,590
I don't know the sort of the original 
historical context for why that tool 

1783
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:35,740
when you want to appear to be smart,
you say antisemetic,

1784
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,190
you don't say anti Jewish.
That's right.

1785
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:40,000
It sounds a bit more.
More educated,

1786
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:43,870
more educated since confirmed dummy.
I can go with anti Jewish.

1787
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:44,890
Well,
pick up the route.

1788
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,620
Can't be.
You can't be a dummy and a good comic,

1789
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:50,140
which you are.
Because as I think we might've discussed

1790
01:23:50,141 --> 01:23:51,190
before,
or maybe we didn't,

1791
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:55,870
there was a correlation between being 
funny and being highly intelligent.

1792
01:23:56,170 --> 01:24:01,170
But whether you probably have.
There's a type of intelligence like 

1793
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,230
mathematically on basically retarded.
I'm really,

1794
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,790
but you probably have good social 
intelligence,

1795
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:08,791
right,
because I'm able to come up with those 

1796
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:08,791
anecdotes,
right?

1797
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:11,770
You actually have acuity to see patterns
in terms of social interactions.

1798
01:24:11,771 --> 01:24:14,650
Otherwise,
what will be much for Pat,

1799
01:24:14,651 --> 01:24:19,651
myself on the back.
So I'll let you do that real quick and 

1800
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:19,651
then we'll move on.
Well,

1801
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:21,160
I'm overwhelmed by your charisma,
Joe.

1802
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:24,820
Thank you very much sir.
But getting back to this video,

1803
01:24:24,821 --> 01:24:29,821
um,
I didn't see anyone freaking out over 

1804
01:24:29,821 --> 01:24:31,690
it,
but anything that may be a Sam Harris,

1805
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:36,691
our friend would say over overblown and 
blown out of proportion to the extreme 

1806
01:24:36,731 --> 01:24:41,260
because it's a target because that label
Islamophobia is so.

1807
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:46,261
He's like when Ben Affleck that fucking 
dumb ass when he went after him on the 

1808
01:24:46,261 --> 01:24:48,310
bill Maher show and just like really 
like,

1809
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:53,710
it was such an obvious ploy to like fit 
into that idea.

1810
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,870
The eye.
It wasn't like a well thought out,

1811
01:24:55,871 --> 01:24:59,110
well examined point of view.
It was like,

1812
01:24:59,111 --> 01:25:00,720
I can't believe what you're saying.
What you're saying.

1813
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:03,430
So racist.
He's arrogant and his ignorance.

1814
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:08,820
Yes.
Arrogant in the fact that he felt like 

1815
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:09,520
this was an easy thing to pull off.
That's what.

1816
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:11,570
And he'd get the applause from the 
audience.

1817
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:14,470
He was searching for Social Brownie 
points,

1818
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,930
surfing Social Brownie points,
going back to the,

1819
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:19,570
to the anti Jewish stuff.
I mean,

1820
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:21,340
I grew up in Lebanon,
as you know,

1821
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:23,730
and I'm Jewish,
I mean an atheist,

1822
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:26,380
but I'm Jewish.
Tough accent by the way,

1823
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,850
for anybody who's going to write and 
say,

1824
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:29,620
well,
how could he be Jewish and atheist?

1825
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:34,650
You can be both.
Some of the most famous Jews were all 

1826
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:36,520
atheists.
Judaism is more than just adherence to a

1827
01:25:36,521 --> 01:25:38,080
set of religious narratives,
right?

1828
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:41,680
There's a cultural element.
There is a historical element.

1829
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:46,681
There are all sorts of fastest to being 
Jewish that don't necessarily mean you 

1830
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:46,681
have to believe in Booga Booga stuff,
right?

1831
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:51,450
Booga Booga not going to get hate mail 
from the rabbis hate from the Buddha.

1832
01:25:51,991 --> 01:25:53,170
Buddha too.
But anyways,

1833
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,940
uh,
so I grew up in Lebanon,

1834
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,080
uh,
now you might say,

1835
01:25:56,081 --> 01:25:58,090
oh,
but Lebanon was such a progressive,

1836
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:03,120
tolerant,
wonderful place where everybody got 

1837
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,251
along.
I wouldn't say that I used to date a 

1838
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:05,251
Lebanese girl.
And what did say she told me it's

1839
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:06,230
fucking craziness.
Was it that she was.

1840
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:07,760
Well,
she grew up in America,

1841
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:10,160
but her family was from Lebanon and she,
you know,

1842
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:10,840
well,
the,

1843
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:15,910
the,
the typical sort of narrative that you 

1844
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:17,561
hear is that Lebanon was of all 
countries in the Middle East was the 

1845
01:26:17,561 --> 01:26:19,580
most progressive one and have to some 
extent that was true.

1846
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,840
But what they don't understand is that 
progressive in the context of the Middle

1847
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,840
East is very,
very different than progressive in the 

1848
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:28,840
West.
Right?

1849
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,380
So if you were Jewish,
you were quilt tolerated.

1850
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:34,040
That means that will tolerate you until 
we no longer tolerate you.

1851
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:39,100
Enhanced.
That's why we left Lebanon because we 

1852
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:39,100
were going to be executed.
Right.

1853
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:39,100
Uh,
so,

1854
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,970
uh,
I grew up sort of with a dark secret.

1855
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,960
I'm Jewish.
I mean,

1856
01:26:41,961 --> 01:26:43,730
right.
You didn't wear a star of David.

1857
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:45,500
Now if people wanted to find out if you 
were Jewish,

1858
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,370
they could easily do that.

1859
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:51,370
They could go to synagogue on Saturday.
And so it's not as though it was 

1860
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:52,610
absolutely hidden,
but you certainly,

1861
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:58,120
you know,
know your place amongst the greater 

1862
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:58,760
crowd.
You're a minority and we tolerate you.

1863
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,260
You live,
if you like,

1864
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:01,790
if I don't know if you know the term,
do you know the term?

1865
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:06,830
They may know them as a second,
third class citizen as enshrined in the 

1866
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,100
Islamic texts for people at the book,
meaning Christians and Jews.

1867
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,960
Meaning monotheists,
right?

1868
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:16,160
Not,
not the Pagans,

1869
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:18,020
not the polytheist,
not the Hindus,

1870
01:27:18,021 --> 01:27:19,550
not the,
not the Buddhist,

1871
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:24,580
not the atheist,
but Jews and Christians under Islamic 

1872
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:27,620
law could be afforded protection as long
as they paid the right.

1873
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:32,621
That means they pay sort of a poll tax 
to be protected by their Muslim 

1874
01:27:32,621 --> 01:27:32,621
overlords.
Whoa,

1875
01:27:32,621 --> 01:27:34,810
okay.
That's called to live as a Dhimmi.

1876
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:36,710
Okay.
So in Lebanon,

1877
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:39,290
you didn't officially have to pay that 
poll tax,

1878
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,050
but what you did is you knew your place.

1879
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,700
So for example,
my brother David,

1880
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:48,880
who was a,
you would like this because you're a 

1881
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:48,880
fighter,
a guy mma guy.

1882
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,350
He used to be in the Olympics and judo 
and Nike 76.

1883
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:52,160
Well,
in,

1884
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:57,161
in the early seventies,
he had won several Lebanese 

1885
01:27:57,161 --> 01:28:00,071
championships and then one day he was 
visited by some guys who told him that,

1886
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:00,890
you know,
Jew,

1887
01:28:00,891 --> 01:28:03,560
boy,
it's time to sort of stop winning.

1888
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:07,280
So it's time to retire or else you end 
up at the bottom of a river.

1889
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:10,730
Then he left to pursue his career in 
judo and France.

1890
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:13,390
This was before the civil war stuff.
My,

1891
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,420
my,
when we,

1892
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:15,710
when we escaped Lebanon,
I mean,

1893
01:28:15,711 --> 01:28:19,100
literally we're escaping execution when,
when the,

1894
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:24,190
uh,
this is the first time that anybody 

1895
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:24,190
hears this particular story.
So you're,

1896
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:25,040
that's your birthday gift.
So,

1897
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:25,940
uh,
as we,

1898
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:31,180
as we,
as the captain said that we were out of 

1899
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,460
Lebanese airspace,
this is when we're leaving Lebanon to,

1900
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:34,480
to immigrate to Canada.
Uh,

1901
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,050
and he says,
we're out of Lebanese.

1902
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,160
My mother takes out a star of David,
puts it around my neck and says,

1903
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:44,660
now you don't have to hide who you are.
Now this is in progressive Lebanon,

1904
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:46,700
pluralistic Lebanon.
So now,

1905
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:51,790
now watch what's gonna happen.
Now I'm going to receive comments of 

1906
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:54,491
people saying what a hate monger he is.
He's just trying to make those other 

1907
01:28:54,711 --> 01:28:59,711
folks look bad.
So my whole personal history as somehow 

1908
01:28:59,711 --> 01:29:01,890
negated,
I'm either making it up or

1909
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,140
why am I talking about this?
Why are you making.

1910
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:08,820
So I'm the hateful guy for mentioning 
that I escaped execution of others.

1911
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:13,840
Well,
I don't think you should pay those 

1912
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,531
people any minds for certainly not 
address them when they're not even 

1913
01:29:15,531 --> 01:29:18,051
communicating with you.
You like sort of artificially bringing 

1914
01:29:18,051 --> 01:29:18,870
up their voices and then responding to 
their voices.

1915
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:21,690
There's no need for that godfather move 
on.

1916
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,240
Um,
but this,

1917
01:29:23,241 --> 01:29:23,910
uh,
it,

1918
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:28,990
it disturbed me that this video wasn't 
this video of this guy walking through 

1919
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,250
Paris.
Was He,

1920
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:36,230
he was a Jewish gentleman who was 
dressed as,

1921
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,830
he was exciting.
He was,

1922
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:42,831
it was,
it was like that girl that walked 

1923
01:29:42,831 --> 01:29:42,831
through Manhattan and got all the cat.
Exactly.

1924
01:29:42,831 --> 01:29:43,560
That's exactly the idea behind it was to
sort of.

1925
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:48,590
There is everybody knows it's similar.
There's an almost the identical clip in 

1926
01:29:48,601 --> 01:29:53,601
Cairo.
You could look it up on youtube where a 

1927
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:56,331
guy where's sort of the aesthetic look 
and he starts walking around Cairo and 

1928
01:29:56,331 --> 01:29:56,490
it's not pretty.

1929
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:58,960
What lucky you didn't get killed,
right?

1930
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:04,250
It's just so fucking crazy that we're in
this world where we're at now where 

1931
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:08,970
people are so terrified of the label,
Islamophobia and of Islam,

1932
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:10,670
of what happened with Charlie Hebdo.
Yes.

1933
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,960
Things along those lines.
The Charlie Hebdo,

1934
01:30:12,961 --> 01:30:15,780
if you don't know the story,
it's a magazine and Paris,

1935
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:19,230
they would draw these cartoons of 
Muhammad and they were uh,

1936
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,960
all the cartoonists were killed by 
gunman,

1937
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,330
Muslim government.
So what does it say right here?

1938
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:27,180
Scroll down to the top please.
Jamie walk.

1939
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:30,390
Watch the abuse the Jewish man gets as 
you walk through Paris.

1940
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:34,680
And this is from [inaudible] dot com and
it's just fucking crazy.

1941
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:40,780
The team film for Ten hours to get 90 
seconds of material that they had to go 

1942
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:42,430
to the roughest parts of Paris to get.
Oh,

1943
01:30:42,431 --> 01:30:43,710
so they're saying,
okay.

1944
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,040
So this is very similar.
Right?

1945
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:47,250
So,
um,

1946
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:53,180
so what they're saying I guess is that 
they really kind of blew it out of 

1947
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:56,991
proportion because they edited it down 
from this 10 hours to get,

1948
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,070
to get 90 seconds.

1949
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:01,200
Is that what they're saying?
Jamie said 90 seconds.

1950
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,670
Yeah.
Okay.

1951
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:07,671
I,
you don't need to watch the youtube 

1952
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:09,681
clip.
I just have to tell you about my 

1953
01:31:09,681 --> 01:31:09,681
personal history in Lebanon.
Do you want to hear some more stuff?

1954
01:31:09,681 --> 01:31:12,360
I'd love to.
I'm maybe nine years old.

1955
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:14,570
Uh,
maybe the equivalent of great for here.

1956
01:31:14,571 --> 01:31:16,470
Great.
Three or four teacher says,

1957
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:18,090
okay,
everybody,

1958
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:19,720
here's the exercise for the next 
whatever,

1959
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:24,790
half an hour.
Get up and tell the class what you want 

1960
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:24,790
to be when you grew up.
So,

1961
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:25,320
uh,
hi,

1962
01:31:25,321 --> 01:31:26,790
my name.
I want to be a soccer player.

1963
01:31:26,791 --> 01:31:28,410
I want to be a policeman.
I want to be this.

1964
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:31,020
He gets up,
I remember his name.

1965
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:34,560
I actually couldn't even recognize his 
face and the old photos.

1966
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:37,130
It says,
when I grow up teacher,

1967
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,730
I want to be a Jew.
Killer,

1968
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,780
killer,
killer.

1969
01:31:39,781 --> 01:31:42,270
Everybody breaks out into applause.
Now,

1970
01:31:42,271 --> 01:31:47,070
does that mean that everybody in Lebanon
was this Rabid Anti Semite?

1971
01:31:47,071 --> 01:31:48,700
Of course not.
But is,

1972
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:53,750
is,
is our dose feelings pervasive through 

1973
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:57,500
out every social fabric,
whether it be on TV and political 

1974
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:00,040
speeches and dramas and soap operas.

1975
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,780
It,
it's everywhere.

1976
01:32:01,781 --> 01:32:06,781
It's endemic to every single DNA of 
those societies.

1977
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:12,390
Uh,
and so that's why you have these types 

1978
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:14,161
of problems.
I'll give you another quick example of 

1979
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:14,161
school,
but that one real quick,

1980
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:14,780
if you don't mind,
please do.

1981
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:17,750
So now we're getting into some serious 
nine years old,

1982
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:19,080
nine years old,
nine eight,

1983
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:22,000
10 minutes radios in that area.
And um,

1984
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:23,770
what,
what was going through your mind?

1985
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:26,620
And this is a time where you kind of,
you as you said,

1986
01:32:26,621 --> 01:32:27,760
you knew your place,
so you,

1987
01:32:27,761 --> 01:32:28,660
you,
you didn't,

1988
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,470
you didn't openly talk about your 
Judaism or.

1989
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:33,460
Yeah,
I mean you're just,

1990
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:34,210
you know,
you did.

1991
01:32:34,211 --> 01:32:36,280
People know you because you know,
you're Jewish so it's not,

1992
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:39,220
it's not.
Your students did know I was,

1993
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:40,940
I was a student,
but do you think this too,

1994
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,020
I mean,
just your students follow suit?

1995
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:48,030
My cohorts.
I think many of them probably didn't 

1996
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:48,030
know that I was Jewish.

1997
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:48,030
Uh,
uh,

1998
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:48,430
I'm almost certain.
I mean,

1999
01:32:48,431 --> 01:32:53,431
I don't know,
I didn't sit there and talk about these 

2000
01:32:53,431 --> 01:32:53,431
issues as a kid said Ju killer.
Whoa,

2001
01:32:53,431 --> 01:32:54,040
what the fuck man?
What,

2002
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:55,660
what did,
what did that feel like?

2003
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:56,410
Well,
it,

2004
01:32:56,690 --> 01:32:58,660
it,
it feels like you're different.

2005
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,810
It feels like you're in a precarious 
situation always.

2006
01:33:01,811 --> 01:33:03,840
It feels like a,
you know,

2007
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:04,590
uh,
and French.

2008
01:33:04,591 --> 01:33:07,490
There's an expression swab bell,
which means a,

2009
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:10,000
be pretty and sit quietly,
right?

2010
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:12,430
Uh,
that's what it know your place.

2011
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,580
Okay.
So that's what it means to be tolerant,

2012
01:33:15,581 --> 01:33:17,350
right?
To be tolerated.

2013
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:19,690
It's not,
it's not that you're equal right here.

2014
01:33:19,691 --> 01:33:24,691
Never equal.
You can't be prime minister of Lebanon 

2015
01:33:24,691 --> 01:33:26,410
as a Jew.
I'll give you another quick story.

2016
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:27,410
Uh,
uh,

2017
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:31,600
there was a general Egyptian politics 
from say the seventies.

2018
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:36,630
There was a Abdulnasser was a famous Pan
Arabesque who brought together the Arab 

2019
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:37,120
world.

2020
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,000
He was an Egyptian,
a president who,

2021
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:45,240
who was viewed as the hero because he 
was going to sort of unite the Arab 

2022
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,160
world against the colonial powers and so
on.

2023
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:53,230
And so he was this kind of larger than 
life superhero of the Arab world when he

2024
01:33:53,231 --> 01:33:56,590
died in 1970,
as often happens in the Middle East,

2025
01:33:56,591 --> 01:34:00,220
there are all these incredibly sort of 
violent demonstrations on the streets.

2026
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:02,950
And I was sitting in my house.
I was maybe five years old,

2027
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:07,360
almost six.
And as this mass of people pass,

2028
01:34:07,361 --> 01:34:09,940
by all you hear that the Jews,
the Jews,

2029
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:15,150
what,
what did the Jews have to do with this 

2030
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:17,230
politician passing away in Egypt?
But that's just the reflex,

2031
01:34:17,231 --> 01:34:17,650
right?
I mean,

2032
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:19,720
it must be some Zionist conspiracy.
It must be.

2033
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:24,900
So I'm sitting there sort of hiding in 
my balcony as these people are passing 

2034
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:28,830
and it's etched in my memory,
the chance of death to Jews.

2035
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:34,440
And there are all these sort of Arabic 
chance that I could repeat now that you 

2036
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:34,440
know,
people wouldn't understand them.

2037
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,060
That's just part of how things were.
Now,

2038
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:42,840
does that mean that on every single day,
every single day of my life there I was 

2039
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,150
being persecuted.
Of course not right.

2040
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:47,470
I mean I lived a normal life until I was
going to be executed.

2041
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,570
So that's the reality of the Middle 
East.

2042
01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:54,340
And that's why today you almost have no 
religious minorities to speak of and you

2043
01:34:54,341 --> 01:34:55,330
were in the Middle East,
right?

2044
01:34:55,331 --> 01:35:00,331
I mean,
the remaining bastions of Christianity 

2045
01:35:00,331 --> 01:35:03,310
in the Middle East are now either being 
clobbered or they're forced to leave 

2046
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:04,190
right?
In Iraq,

2047
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:05,720
in,
uh,

2048
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:10,721
the cops in Egypt to some extent now 
we're seeing it also in Nigeria.

2049
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:12,410
Uh,
and so,

2050
01:35:12,910 --> 01:35:15,230
you know,
this idea that we all kind of coexist in

2051
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:16,460
the released.
This is Bologna.

2052
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:18,530
It's not true.
You're tolerated at best.

2053
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:24,310
What are the,
what was the percentage of people that 

2054
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,310
were Jews in Lebanon when you were 
there?

2055
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:27,890
So at the,
so we were part of the last remaining 

2056
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:31,510
Jews in Lebanon at one point I think I 
could be off on the numbers and you'll 

2057
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:34,730
correct me if I'm wrong later,
maybe in the descriptor,

2058
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:36,950
maybe 15,000
at most.

2059
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:38,260
15,
$20,000

2060
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:41,010
out of a population of about maybe $3 
million at the zenith.

2061
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,550
Right?
So a very small minority.

2062
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:48,820
Now when Israel came along in 1948,
it made it that much more difficult to 

2063
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:55,331
be Jewish and Arab countries.
Now this is not to give cover to 

2064
01:35:55,331 --> 01:35:55,880
antisemitism,
which is independent of Israel,

2065
01:35:56,090 --> 01:36:01,090
right?
Antisemitism has existed for 1400 years 

2066
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:01,090
in those parts of the world 
independently of Israel.

2067
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:06,220
But once Israel came about in 1948,
it just made it that much more 

2068
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:10,001
precarious for Jews to live in Libya and
Iraq and in Egypt and in Syria and 

2069
01:36:10,001 --> 01:36:10,001
Lebanon.

2070
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:14,510
And so they'd be these mass exoduses of 
Jews from Arab lands,

2071
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:19,660
sometimes forced other times by choice 
because it just became untenable for 

2072
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:24,401
Jews to be there.
We were part of the last wave of 

2073
01:36:24,401 --> 01:36:27,821
remaining Jews because we were very 
entrenched within Lebanese society.

2074
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:33,320
Uh,
but then once the civil war started and 

2075
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:33,320
it just wasn't possible to be there in 
Lebanon,

2076
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:37,841
you had these internal ID cards that you
carried around like a passport,

2077
01:36:38,061 --> 01:36:41,420
but internally that stated your religion
on it.

2078
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:46,870
So in the context of the Lebanese civil 
war where they would set up these 

2079
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:46,870
roadblocks,
these militia would set up roadblocks.

2080
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:49,640
If you get to a roadblock and somebody 
says in Arabic,

2081
01:36:49,641 --> 01:36:51,950
you say how we give me your,
your,

2082
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:52,700
your,
uh,

2083
01:36:52,701 --> 01:36:54,020
your ID card.
Well,

2084
01:36:54,021 --> 01:36:58,280
that ID card has your religion on it.
If you're the wrong religion,

2085
01:36:58,610 --> 01:36:59,220
it's good.
Bye.

2086
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:04,950
Well,
that was what's going on with the Sunni 

2087
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:04,950
and Shiite in Iraq.
Exactly,

2088
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:05,900
exactly.
Roadblocks,

2089
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,580
roadblocks to kill people.
Well,

2090
01:37:07,581 --> 01:37:12,200
the problem in the Middle East is that 
you have endless abrahamic religions.

2091
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:13,970
And again,
it's not just the Mazda,

2092
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:15,800
and I'm not trying to be relativists 
here,

2093
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:21,100
but all the abrahamic religions sort of 
have a narrative of uniqueness and it's 

2094
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:24,300
very,
very hard to coexist when you know,

2095
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,910
each of us is the chosen people.

2096
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:31,050
I have my theory about the Middle East 
and my theory is that they're the 

2097
01:37:31,050 --> 01:37:32,890
townies of the world.
What does that mean?

2098
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,770
The townies are the people that never 
left their neighborhood.

2099
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:42,240
And if you,
if you look at the cradle of 

2100
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:42,240
civilization,
it's Babylon.

2101
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,400
It's sue mayor.
So that's the oldest written language,

2102
01:37:45,401 --> 01:37:47,410
oldest mathematics,
that's where Iraq is,

2103
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:49,900
right?
And that area is a clusterfuck today.

2104
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:53,350
And everybody moved out of there.
Everybody moved out of Africa.

2105
01:37:53,351 --> 01:37:54,340
Africa's chaos,
right?

2106
01:37:54,341 --> 01:37:55,830
We all know that.
Um,

2107
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:56,040
I

2108
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,840
think that much like small towns,
you grow up in and if you go back,

2109
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:01,530
there you go,
Jesus,

2110
01:38:01,531 --> 01:38:03,930
he's fucking assholes are still hanging 
around the high school,

2111
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:06,460
you know,
being annoying at the gas station.

2112
01:38:06,461 --> 01:38:07,320
They,
the same people there.

2113
01:38:07,321 --> 01:38:10,770
They're stuck in the same way.
They have not evolved,

2114
01:38:10,771 --> 01:38:15,771
they have not moved past the rest of the
world has and it seems like with a lot 

2115
01:38:15,771 --> 01:38:19,551
of these religions,
they're so rigid in their ideology and 

2116
01:38:19,551 --> 01:38:23,961
the standards of their behavior and the 
classifications of the individuals that 

2117
01:38:23,961 --> 01:38:25,650
are involved in it,
that it's almost inescapable.

2118
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:30,950
These rigid ideology seem like it's the 
idea of progressive thinking or 

2119
01:38:32,071 --> 01:38:33,690
progressive thought.
It's almost.

2120
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:39,990
They're almost mutually exclusive.
You can't have that and exist in that.

2121
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:45,260
In that form.
Coalitional thinking is a endemic part 

2122
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:46,980
of human psychology,
right?

2123
01:38:46,981 --> 01:38:51,981
The idea of us versus them as part of 
human nature and what these Abrahamic 

2124
01:38:52,651 --> 01:38:56,010
religions do is they take this and they 
put her on steroids.

2125
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:57,020
Right?
I mean it it.

2126
01:38:57,190 --> 01:39:02,190
It is a great study.
I can't remember who it is or I might 

2127
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:02,250
punch it up a bit,
but it goes something like this.

2128
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:07,490
You're bringing people into the lab and 
you make them wait in the waiting area 

2129
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:10,470
and you just put a sticker either blue 
or red on them and then you say,

2130
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:15,500
Oh,
you're not going to come back in a few 

2131
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,000
minutes.
I'm going to go off to do something 

2132
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:17,000
else.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

2133
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,060
The real point of the experiment is to 
see what people ended up doing during 

2134
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:21,870
that time that you're out.
What do you think happens?

2135
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,380
The people who have the red sticks read 
the stickers,

2136
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,450
start speaking to each other and the 
people,

2137
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:32,480
right,
so you're taking a completely random 

2138
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,520
queue and you're forcing people to 
assort along that cute right now,

2139
01:39:34,651 --> 01:39:39,651
it's no longer matters what my sexual 
orientation is or whether I'm Muslim or 

2140
01:39:39,651 --> 01:39:39,651
Christian or Jewish.

2141
01:39:39,651 --> 01:39:42,150
It's red people band together versus 
blue people.

2142
01:39:42,151 --> 01:39:47,151
There are various versions of this 
experiment that had been done and in 

2143
01:39:47,151 --> 01:39:49,140
classic social psychology,
but what that speaks to is this,

2144
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:51,890
a inextricable,
this,

2145
01:39:51,891 --> 01:39:56,891
this inescapable trap of coalitional 
psychology and that's what happens in 

2146
01:39:56,891 --> 01:40:01,521
the Middle East.
Everything is viewed through the prism 

2147
01:40:01,521 --> 01:40:04,730
of my faith and anybody who's not my 
faith is the other and the other is not.

2148
01:40:05,281 --> 01:40:08,160
To be trusted is to be hated as to be 
scoring that.

2149
01:40:08,190 --> 01:40:13,190
Now,
that doesn't mean that every single 

2150
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:14,421
person subscribes to that,
but it certainly means that the 

2151
01:40:14,421 --> 01:40:17,451
narrative,
the religious narratives certainly 

2152
01:40:17,451 --> 01:40:17,451
condones that,
so yeah,

2153
01:40:17,451 --> 01:40:21,381
with rigid ideologies and tribal 
behavior and then add that to a very 

2154
01:40:21,381 --> 01:40:25,551
harsh environment,
physical environment where it's just 

2155
01:40:25,551 --> 01:40:29,420
unforgiving.
It's real hard to move past that real 

2156
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:32,871
hard to find forgiveness and 
enlightenment and see in and matter of 

2157
01:40:32,871 --> 01:40:37,101
fact.
That was one of the things is another 

2158
01:40:37,101 --> 01:40:38,481
issue that I think,
I believe it was Michael Shermer who 

2159
01:40:38,481 --> 01:40:40,671
wrote an article about the difference 
between Islam and some of the other 

2160
01:40:40,671 --> 01:40:42,620
religions is that they never went 
through the enlightenment.

2161
01:40:42,621 --> 01:40:43,650
Right.
Well,

2162
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:45,050
I think one of the problem,
one of the.

2163
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:50,540
You now see many a vociferous in public 
intellectuals that are coming out to a 

2164
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:54,130
call for an reformation,

2165
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,260
but that's actually been happening for 
1400 years.

2166
01:40:56,261 --> 01:41:01,261
The problem is it's easy to call for a 
reformation if you assume that there's 

2167
01:41:01,261 --> 01:41:03,220
something to be reformed.
If you think it's perfect.

2168
01:41:03,221 --> 01:41:08,221
There's nothing to be reformed right 
here in PA state for even considering 

2169
01:41:08,221 --> 01:41:08,500
that,
but if you're going to reform it,

2170
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:11,380
how do you go about doing that?
When one of the tenants,

2171
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:15,240
the tenants,
is that in Arabic you say a kid,

2172
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:20,790
meaning every single letter of the Koran
is immutable,

2173
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:23,350
is eternal and it's perfect.
Well,

2174
01:41:23,351 --> 01:41:27,980
how can you have an exit?
Just how could you exit just as like a,

2175
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:33,360
I'm not pronouncing it right,
but like how could you interpret texts 

2176
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,941
or reinterpret texts when in reality you
doing that becomes a form of 

2177
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:39,340
sacrilegious.
Right?

2178
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:42,820
So that's the problem in the context of 
the other Abrahamic religions,

2179
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:48,540
there was the capacity for the light of 
reformation to squeeze its way into 

2180
01:41:49,001 --> 01:41:52,300
those little holes so that there could 
be new interpretations and so on.

2181
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:57,650
In Islam it's a bit more of a challenge.
So what about people that are Islamic 

2182
01:41:57,761 --> 01:42:02,761
reformers?
Who are the members of the people in 

2183
01:42:02,761 --> 01:42:06,310
the.
There are people today that considered 

2184
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:08,551
themselves Muslim but also are atheists.
There are people that consider 

2185
01:42:08,551 --> 01:42:12,391
themselves Muslims,
like you consider yourself a Jew but 

2186
01:42:12,391 --> 01:42:12,391
you're an atheist.
Right?

2187
01:42:12,391 --> 01:42:14,380
What about those people that don't 
aren't so ideologically rigid,

2188
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:17,140
rigid?
Think they all moved right there.

2189
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:22,150
Don't move down,
and they certainly never openly stated 

2190
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:23,810
they're not unbelief in the Middle East,
during Ramadan with that.

2191
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:26,020
That would not be good.
Don't be good.

2192
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:27,970
They'll fuck you up if you eat during 
Ramadan.

2193
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:28,530
Right?
Well,

2194
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:33,540
and certainly isis now has killed many 
people who violated a Ramadan rules,

2195
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,070
uh,
now,

2196
01:42:36,071 --> 01:42:41,071
of course,
then you'll hear back that they're not 

2197
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:41,071
really.
They're not Islamic,

2198
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:41,071
right?
I do hear that.

2199
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:45,090
Listen,
I've engaged people in various forums 

2200
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:45,090
where we start chatting.

2201
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:48,410
Then I'll quote something from say,
do you know who he is?

2202
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:51,760
He's the spiritual leader of the Muslim 
Brotherhood.

2203
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,140
One of the foremost leaders of the 
Sunni.

2204
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:58,870
A Sec.
In terms of as a religious scholar,

2205
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:03,930
right?
I mean all the perfect right pedigree 

2206
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:05,650
from an scholar scholars,
Islamic scholarship perspective.

2207
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:11,040
So I'll quote something by him.
What do you think there were about the 

2208
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:11,040
Olivia,
but he's not a real Muslim.

2209
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:16,500
Then I'll quote something from the 
college of the so called Colophon Lysis 

2210
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:23,850
who has a phd in Islamic Studies.
What do you think the answer is not a 

2211
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:25,790
real Muslim then I'll.
Right,

2212
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,280
so.
So it's play.

2213
01:43:27,281 --> 01:43:28,210
Hide the ball.
Right?

2214
01:43:28,211 --> 01:43:30,850
So.
So if you have so much duplicity in your

2215
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:35,851
discourse that guys who by definition 
are leaders and experts of Islam who are

2216
01:43:37,691 --> 01:43:42,691
then being a.
You pretend that they're not Muslim 

2217
01:43:42,691 --> 01:43:46,200
because they say something that you,
you find objectionable than how can we 

2218
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,830
have an often and honest discourse you 
can't,

2219
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:49,960
so how do we fix that?
That's my my,

2220
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,040
my,
my running.

2221
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:51,890
By the way,

2222
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:53,930
my last podcast.
How do we fix this?

2223
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:58,990
I think we fixed it with everything by 
having people who have the courage as 

2224
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:01,700
many of some of your guests have and 
maybe I can include myself in this group

2225
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:04,880
who are open,
who are honest,

2226
01:44:04,910 --> 01:44:09,910
who are reasonable,
who are not filled with hate to who are 

2227
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:10,130
dispassionate.
Also,

2228
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:13,460
they moved all of the moved moved out of
the Middle East.

2229
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:17,000
So you're just saying that they can't 
implement these changes on the ground.

2230
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:18,200
I'm not saying that,
but I'm like,

2231
01:44:18,201 --> 01:44:21,270
how do you.
And I'm not sure if,

2232
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:23,840
I think if I've got the answer then I 
would be getting the Nobel prize.

2233
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,720
Who is the writer?
Uh,

2234
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:29,360
something Roy that was hacked to death 
with the machete rails?

2235
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:32,000
Yeah,
there has been for them so far.

2236
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:36,060
Yeah.
He was somewhere else doing a,

2237
01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:41,630
it was some sort of a speech on his book
that he wrote back to Bangladesh was 

2238
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:41,630
hacked.

2239
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:41,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

2240
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:43,180
Hacked to death by machetes.
Um,

2241
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:47,120
on the street in front of his wife was 
hacked up to was horrible.

2242
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,640
You know what the response is when I've 
challenged people on that.

2243
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:53,790
What they did was not Islamic.
Right.

2244
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:55,700
Look,
let me give you an example.

2245
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:56,860
Uh,
there was a,

2246
01:44:56,870 --> 01:45:01,870
uh,
a recent Orthodox Jew who in the gay 

2247
01:45:01,870 --> 01:45:03,900
pride parade in Tel Aviv that Ed did you
have on this?

2248
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,660
I did hear about this with stabbing 
people.

2249
01:45:05,661 --> 01:45:06,470
Stabbing people,
right?

2250
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:07,250
Yeah.
I mean,

2251
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:11,000
he didn't do this because he was 
alienated.

2252
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:15,530
He didn't do this as a response to the 
financial crisis of 2007,

2253
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:16,910
2008.
I'm using examples,

2254
01:45:16,911 --> 01:45:21,911
by the way,
from Russell brand's luminary analysis 

2255
01:45:21,911 --> 01:45:23,900
as to why people join isis.
It has nothing to hold up.

2256
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:26,660
Russell brand thinks that Russell and I 
actually,

2257
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,800
I did a youtube clip,
uh,

2258
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,880
on my youtube channel where I basically 
covered all this.

2259
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:33,740
The comedian Russell brand.
Oh yeah.

2260
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:37,100
The luminary.
Luminary sarcastically.

2261
01:45:37,101 --> 01:45:39,590
Yes.
He basically was arguing that,

2262
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:40,610
uh,
uh,

2263
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,200
he,
he,

2264
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:46,270
he came up with every single possible 
cause that you could think of other than

2265
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:50,870
religious fervor to explain why people 
move 4,000

2266
01:45:50,871 --> 01:45:53,510
miles away to join isis.
It was due.

2267
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:55,700
So let me give you a few.
There were about maybe seven or eight.

2268
01:45:55,701 --> 01:45:57,530
I covered on my youtube clip,
but I'll,

2269
01:45:57,740 --> 01:46:00,740
I'll try to come up with three or four.
They were alienated.

2270
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:04,000
They felt that they weren't part of the 
political process.

2271
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,560
Want to say it the way he says it?
I,

2272
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:07,880
I can't,
I can't really alienated,

2273
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:11,570
didn't feel like they are part of the 
political process.

2274
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,520
Yeah.
I can't do it as well as you can.

2275
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:15,530
Uh,
they were,

2276
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:20,620
they were upset about the financial 
meltdown in 2017 financial meltdown.

2277
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:25,850
They hated greedy,
rampant evil capitalism.

2278
01:46:27,470 --> 01:46:29,690
Capitalism,
right.

2279
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:30,890
My son,
all the right words.

2280
01:46:30,891 --> 01:46:32,120
Very good.
Uh,

2281
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:34,290
so I mean,
I mean really that's,

2282
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:39,350
that's the reason why people join.
I mean there's nothing to do with 

2283
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:39,350
religion,
absolutely nothing to do with it.

2284
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:44,080
So how could we have an honest discourse
when this is the kind of nonsense that 

2285
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,561
you keep hearing,
but you're talking to comedians and 

2286
01:46:47,561 --> 01:46:47,561
again,
you're talking to a comedian right now.

2287
01:46:47,561 --> 01:46:49,990
So any logic out of this healed.
He hit some,

2288
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,660
some people actually challenged me to 
say,

2289
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:54,900
well,
why do you even take the time to counter

2290
01:46:54,901 --> 01:46:56,100
this guy's views?
Well,

2291
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:59,910
and my answer is he's got a lot bigger 
platform than I do,

2292
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:05,130
right?
He has much more power to influence 

2293
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:05,730
minds than I do.
It doesn't matter that I might be better

2294
01:47:05,731 --> 01:47:10,731
equipped than him as he's an athletic,
as there's been athletes and that sort 

2295
01:47:10,731 --> 01:47:10,731
of thing.
Exactly.

2296
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:15,970
And it seems like they're both kind of 
fishing for social brownie points 

2297
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:18,900
instead of calling it Islam or instead 
of calling it anything,

2298
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:21,600
if you just looked at it as a pattern or
behavior,

2299
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:23,480
and if you looked at that pattern and 
behavior,

2300
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:28,490
this ideological pattern or behavior 
that would seek out to murder people 

2301
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:31,500
that don't agree with those thoughts,
any rational person would go,

2302
01:47:31,501 --> 01:47:32,580
well that's crazy,
right?

2303
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:34,410
That's these,
these people are fucked.

2304
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:35,340
Like,
this is bad,

2305
01:47:35,341 --> 01:47:36,720
we can't tolerate this.

2306
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:42,050
But once you start calling it anything,
whether you call it Islam or just fill 

2307
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:43,470
in the blank,
make up your own name for it.

2308
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:47,940
And then that becomes an oppressed 
segment of our civilization,

2309
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:53,150
or at least a thought of as an oppressed
or boxed into that political,

2310
01:47:53,191 --> 01:47:56,450
uh,
sort of a segment where you're,

2311
01:47:56,460 --> 01:48:01,460
you're not supposed to shit on it 
because it's thought to be marginalized 

2312
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:03,580
already and you're just piling on.
But do you think that.

2313
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:05,640
So there are 50,
I want to go back in a second,

2314
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:10,700
the Jewish guy.
But let me answer this last point you 

2315
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:14,031
made.
Do you think that in the 57 countries 

2316
01:48:14,031 --> 01:48:14,490
that are a member of the Organization of
Islamic cooperation,

2317
01:48:14,491 --> 01:48:17,040
the OIC,
a Muslims are marginalized?

2318
01:48:17,041 --> 01:48:17,610
No,
right?

2319
01:48:17,611 --> 01:48:22,611
And most of those 57 countries,
they constitute an extraordinary 

2320
01:48:22,611 --> 01:48:26,150
majority,
if not complete majority of it 

2321
01:48:26,150 --> 01:48:26,150
something.
So this,

2322
01:48:26,150 --> 01:48:27,300
this narrative that Muslims are 
marginalized.

2323
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:29,050
I mean,
it's really laughable because I mean,

2324
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:31,380
if you think about Saudi Arabia,
Yemen,

2325
01:48:31,381 --> 01:48:32,460
Kuwait,
Egypt,

2326
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:33,960
Syria,
Iraq,

2327
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:35,100
and on,
and on,

2328
01:48:35,101 --> 01:48:36,020
and on,
uh,

2329
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,380
they're not marginalized.

2330
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,170
They constitute 99 percent,
100 percent of the population,

2331
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:45,200
right?
If anything is the religious minorities 

2332
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:45,990
that are no longer existent there that 
have been marginalized,

2333
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,850
right?
So it's eliminated,

2334
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,090
eliminated,
or exit or genocidally removed.

2335
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:52,050
So this,
this,

2336
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,270
this isn't,
it's an informational war.

2337
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:55,230
Yes.
Now,

2338
01:48:55,231 --> 01:48:57,180
but that's,
that's the most important part.

2339
01:48:57,390 --> 01:49:01,660
It's an inflammation of war and that 
information and ideology that it,

2340
01:49:01,661 --> 01:49:03,120
it's,
it's these things,

2341
01:49:03,121 --> 01:49:05,400
these,
these are thoughts and patterns.

2342
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:08,790
Instead of calling them religion,
instead of calling this,

2343
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:12,320
this cherished tradition or cultural,
uh,

2344
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:13,190
this,
this,

2345
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:18,260
this ancient thing that you're supposed 
to worship instead of calling it that,

2346
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,360
it's,
it's ideas.

2347
01:49:21,361 --> 01:49:26,361
These are ideas,
these ideas that this ancient script is 

2348
01:49:26,361 --> 01:49:28,560
directly handed down from God that every
word is perfect.

2349
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:33,830
If that's not preposterous,
you tell me what the fuck is because I 

2350
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:37,551
get real confused when people who grew 
up without any science,

2351
01:49:37,681 --> 01:49:42,681
I mean,
they literally knew almost nothing when 

2352
01:49:42,681 --> 01:49:42,681
they wrote this in comparison to what we
know today.

2353
01:49:42,681 --> 01:49:46,260
Obviously back then there were scholars,
but right in comparison,

2354
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,310
it's,
it's laughable to think that anybody

2355
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:51,780
had all the answers in 1200 or years.
The Koran,

2356
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:54,280
Britain supposedly in terms of the 
revelations.

2357
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:57,250
So 600 something.
600,

2358
01:49:57,251 --> 01:49:58,580
so 680.
Yeah.

2359
01:49:59,430 --> 01:50:04,430
About 1400 years ago to try reading any 
and textbook book from 1400 years ago 

2360
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,820
and finding correct information.
Right.

2361
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:12,460
What year was Galileo prosecuted?
15 something that's going back to the 

2362
01:50:12,701 --> 01:50:14,040
Jewish guy.
Uh,

2363
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:18,130
I tweeted about it and I shared it.
And of course,

2364
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:22,060
uh,
he undoubtedly got his ideas from,

2365
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,610
I think reading leviticus where,
you know,

2366
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:26,440
if you lay with another man,
you should be killed.

2367
01:50:26,441 --> 01:50:27,010
And so on.
Right?

2368
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:32,340
So if I make that claim right,
which is an absolutely correct claim 

2369
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:36,451
that for this guy who took his old 
testament very seriously and then went 

2370
01:50:36,451 --> 01:50:41,041
around knifing people,
it's an absolutely appropriate claim to 

2371
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:43,140
make either didn't get attacked as 
antisemitic.

2372
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:44,170
Right?
I mean everybody says,

2373
01:50:44,171 --> 01:50:44,710
yeah,
no kidding.

2374
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:49,980
An Orthodox Jew,
which is very rare for an orthodox Jew 

2375
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:49,980
to go around killing people.

2376
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:51,580
But the fact that I made that,
I could make that link,

2377
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:56,940
there was no blow back,
but unfortunately the West has now been 

2378
01:50:56,940 --> 01:51:01,021
convinced that if you ever make that 
link for one particular religion than 

2379
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:05,641
you are hateful.
That's a profoundly dangerous situation 

2380
01:51:05,641 --> 01:51:06,520
to be in.
You seem to,

2381
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:11,550
it seems to be legal in this game to a.
You can shit all over Christians.

2382
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:13,740
Yes.
No.

2383
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,980
As a matter of fact,
as a matter of fact,

2384
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:19,981
if you do that,
you really progressive amongst my 

2385
01:51:19,981 --> 01:51:23,071
academic friends.
If you repeatedly demonstrate what a 

2386
01:51:23,071 --> 01:51:23,290
bunch of buffoons,
uh,

2387
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:27,130
these Christian Pixar,
than that garners you Brownie points.

2388
01:51:27,370 --> 01:51:29,230
Yeah.
Why are Christian Hicks?

2389
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:34,360
I'm any less profound than these,
you know,

2390
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:39,390
because because it slices for Islam,
wrongly is associated with Brown people 

2391
01:51:41,470 --> 01:51:44,650
and you don't mess with that,
but a lot of baptists are black.

2392
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:46,150
True,
true.

2393
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:50,230
Do people mock southern Baptist as much 
as they mark like a.

2394
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:52,690
that's an open empirical question,
right?

2395
01:51:53,070 --> 01:51:54,040
Yeah,
that's a good question.

2396
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:59,130
I bet they kind of leave that alone.
I start singing and chanting against 

2397
01:51:59,130 --> 01:51:59,130
folks.
That's right.

2398
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:00,190
It's a lot of people involved.
Yes.

2399
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:05,310
Solfa old apostolic is ridiculous.
It's funny.

2400
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:07,700
So it's a,
it's,

2401
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:11,860
it's tough dealing with all this stuff 
on a daily basis on twitter and so on.

2402
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:17,040
Well,
people don't want to be judged in a 

2403
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:17,040
negative way and especially in this 
society,

2404
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,610
in this culture and this easy to,
uh,

2405
01:52:19,730 --> 01:52:24,730
act culture because it's really easy to 
make a tweet about someone or write a 

2406
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:28,060
facebook post about someone or a blog 
entry about someone attacking them.

2407
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:30,520
And then once you've done that,
boy,

2408
01:52:30,521 --> 01:52:35,521
you have opened up the flood gates and 
they will just experience all sorts of 

2409
01:52:35,521 --> 01:52:39,751
pylons from all these other people that 
are either agree or support or or don't 

2410
01:52:39,751 --> 01:52:40,720
want to be labeled such themselves.

2411
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:45,720
So they'll attack you to make sure 
everyone knows that they're not like 

2412
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:46,310
you.
Right.

2413
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:51,790
It's interesting that you say that is 
because some of the biggest blow back 

2414
01:52:51,790 --> 01:52:52,250
I've gotten on my public facebook page 
has been,

2415
01:52:52,251 --> 01:52:55,010
whenever I've called out Russell brand 
on something,

2416
01:52:55,490 --> 01:53:00,410
apparently some of my fans are also 
Russell brand fans,

2417
01:53:00,411 --> 01:53:02,830
which I don't know how these two 
worldviews can,

2418
01:53:03,030 --> 01:53:05,960
can coexist,
but they got really upset that,

2419
01:53:06,010 --> 01:53:07,670
you know,
I was being elitist.

2420
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:10,190
You know,
he's doing a lot of social good.

2421
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,050
Yes.
Some of his stuff is quackery,

2422
01:53:12,051 --> 01:53:17,051
but he's a good guy.
His heart is in the right place and I'm 

2423
01:53:17,051 --> 01:53:17,600
being an asshole for criticizing him.
And I really,

2424
01:53:17,601 --> 01:53:20,480
really at Vitriol for some of these 
folks.

2425
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:22,880
And you don't know,
you've never lived in the middle.

2426
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:25,220
Oh wait.
Oh wait,

2427
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:27,650
you've never heard anybody yell,
killed it.

2428
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,220
Oh,
you did.

2429
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:29,660
Now incidentally,
I should.

2430
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:34,130
I should mention that my first exposure 
to Russell brand before I knew about all

2431
01:53:34,131 --> 01:53:36,250
his funny movies.
Well exactly,

2432
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:41,290
and one one in one in particular,
which I must have seen about 10 times a 

2433
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:42,350
forgetting.
Sarah Marshall.

2434
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:43,540
Great movie.
Uh,

2435
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:47,000
and so I've sat there and laughed and 
thought it was a very funny guy.

2436
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:52,330
And then I came across his political 
rants and I no longer thought he was 

2437
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:52,330
such a cool guy.
Well,

2438
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:54,680
as I've said on twitter,
I believe that he is neck deep in hippie

2439
01:53:54,681 --> 01:53:57,320
pussy right now and really has no idea 
what's going on.

2440
01:53:57,350 --> 01:54:02,350
I think they cut off the circulation 
when there's that much hippie pussy 

2441
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:02,840
coming at Ya.
I think the circulation to your brain,

2442
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:08,080
it's very hard for the heart to pump it 
through all the kisses that he received 

2443
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:08,690
on his neck.
It right.

2444
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:10,520
That's the going theory.

2445
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,590
Okay.
That's a pretty good one.

2446
01:54:12,670 --> 01:54:17,670
Oh,
do they throw themselves at that poor 

2447
01:54:17,670 --> 01:54:17,670
guy?
Really?

2448
01:54:17,670 --> 01:54:17,670
Oh yeah.
I'm sure.

2449
01:54:17,670 --> 01:54:17,670
Looking at this beautiful.
Okay.

2450
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:22,690
Used to date Katy Perry who was married 
to her son.

2451
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,880
So what,
what happened to that list?

2452
01:54:24,881 --> 01:54:26,570
Full Union had to save the world,
Bro.

2453
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,400
Popstars.
That's true.

2454
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:31,870
That's all that frivolous shit.
Yeah.

2455
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:34,370
She was religious.
She was,

2456
01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:35,470
yeah.
I mean,

2457
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:38,300
I don't know her exact story,
but apparently she was very,

2458
01:54:38,301 --> 01:54:43,020
very religious and her original sort of 
foray into the music industry all about,

2459
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,470
you know,
sort of Christian religious music.

2460
01:54:45,471 --> 01:54:50,471
Yeah.
And then when that sort of didn't stick 

2461
01:54:50,471 --> 01:54:50,471
then she became,
you know,

2462
01:54:50,471 --> 01:54:51,470
kind of deviated from that and became a 
pop star.

2463
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:55,130
But her roots are very much a Christian 
based.

2464
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:56,600
Well,
you know,

2465
01:54:56,630 --> 01:54:58,580
I think that a lot of these folks with 
that,

2466
01:54:58,581 --> 01:55:00,980
they're trying to do good like a 
russell.

2467
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:02,390
Um,
I,

2468
01:55:02,630 --> 01:55:05,240
I probably,
I mean I probably get along with them.

2469
01:55:05,241 --> 01:55:08,660
Great if I sat down and talked to them 
and I think he,

2470
01:55:08,690 --> 01:55:11,090
when I hear him talk and I hear the 
things that he's saying,

2471
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:16,480
I feel like he is doing a lot of good.
I think he is opening up a lot of 

2472
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:19,541
people's eyes because he is a very 
public figure and he is saying a lot of 

2473
01:55:19,541 --> 01:55:21,680
things that make a lot of sense about 
the financial world,

2474
01:55:21,681 --> 01:55:23,540
about,
about,

2475
01:55:24,530 --> 01:55:29,530
about war.
And about the nature of controlling 

2476
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:33,191
natural resources.
There's a lot of things that he says 

2477
01:55:33,191 --> 01:55:35,501
that I agree with,
but I think that when you get caught up 

2478
01:55:35,501 --> 01:55:38,411
in that world,
there are some very clear sort of 

2479
01:55:38,411 --> 01:55:39,020
behavior patterns that you have to 
subscribe to.

2480
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:44,310
And this Islamophobia label is one.
You want to avoid all fucking

2481
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,440
costs.
If you get hit with that one,

2482
01:55:46,441 --> 01:55:51,441
that's a heavy one today.
So heavy one and this politically 

2483
01:55:51,441 --> 01:55:51,441
charged world,
you know,

2484
01:55:51,441 --> 01:55:55,211
I mean,
I made this point on a show recently 

2485
01:55:55,211 --> 01:55:55,211
that,
you know,

2486
01:55:55,211 --> 01:55:55,580
in the West,
uh,

2487
01:55:55,960 --> 01:56:00,960
the Islam narrative doesn't yet have the
power to literally be had people.

2488
01:56:01,831 --> 01:56:02,270
I mean,
if,

2489
01:56:02,271 --> 01:56:05,640
if you say some really nasty stuff 
against Islam and the Middle East,

2490
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:08,160
what we can solve that problem easily,
we get rid of you.

2491
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:13,910
But in the west,
what you could do is you could be head 

2492
01:56:13,910 --> 01:56:13,910
somebody's reputation,
right?

2493
01:56:13,910 --> 01:56:17,430
I mean them and metaphorical beheading.
And that's what happens to guys like Sam

2494
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:19,260
Harris and Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
Uh,

2495
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:20,910
unfortunately,
uh,

2496
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:21,620
you know,
this,

2497
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:24,380
I've never really faced this kind of 
blowback.

2498
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:26,850
Uh,
maybe because I'm somewhat more measured

2499
01:56:26,851 --> 01:56:31,851
in how I speak,
I'm not exactly sure why you're also 

2500
01:56:31,851 --> 01:56:32,000
talking about your personal income,
uh,

2501
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:37,430
which gives you more authenticity 
whereas Sam is viewed as some white guy 

2502
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:38,190
who's speaking from a fucking cracker.

2503
01:56:38,190 --> 01:56:39,460
Exactly.
Uh,

2504
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:41,670
but I mean,
that's really what you see there are all

2505
01:56:41,671 --> 01:56:43,080
these guys.
I don't know if you know about them,

2506
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:44,970
I won't even mention them.
So I don't give them any,

2507
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:49,530
any airplay that go around pretty much 
blaming everything on.

2508
01:56:49,531 --> 01:56:51,930
So called new atheists.
So.

2509
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:55,410
Right.
Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris Are these

2510
01:56:55,411 --> 01:56:59,380
sort of evil patriarchs before he died 
just before that.

2511
01:56:59,630 --> 01:57:03,990
And you and use the fourth horseman.
There's another Daniel Dennett dude.

2512
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:05,470
Yeah.
He said,

2513
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:06,930
are you joking?
Are you being serious?

2514
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:08,160
I don't know.
Yeah,

2515
01:57:08,161 --> 01:57:11,910
he's a,
he's a philosopher at a school in Boston

2516
01:57:11,911 --> 01:57:13,350
actually,
but maybe brandeis,

2517
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,300
I'm not exactly sure.
One of those schools.

2518
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:16,470
Uh,
but anyways,

2519
01:57:16,490 --> 01:57:20,070
uh,
they go around just smearing these guys,

2520
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:22,090
their hate mongers.
They're evil.

2521
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:25,410
A lot of gravity attached to that.
Exactly.

2522
01:57:25,890 --> 01:57:27,960
And,
and now people who want to come into the

2523
01:57:27,961 --> 01:57:32,961
discussion have to really think hard 
whether they want to be exposed to this 

2524
01:57:33,901 --> 01:57:34,800
kind of blowback.

2525
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:37,200
And so you get self censorship,
right?

2526
01:57:37,230 --> 01:57:38,430
Yes.
I mean I've had,

2527
01:57:38,431 --> 01:57:41,020
and I don't think I've shared this story
ever again,

2528
01:57:41,021 --> 01:57:45,930
so double happy birthday.
So I've had my wife,

2529
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:50,960
so I opened up my laptop and I start 
typing something and she'll come around 

2530
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,870
nervously looking at what I'm typing.
I say,

2531
01:57:52,871 --> 01:57:53,480
well,
what?

2532
01:57:53,490 --> 01:57:55,960
Why are you hovering over me?
And she said,

2533
01:57:55,990 --> 01:58:00,990
and I mean this,
this should give chills to anybody 

2534
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:00,990
listening to this.
Just like,

2535
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:02,190
remember we have two children.
Oh God.

2536
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:07,220
Right now I'm thinking in the 21st 
century a professor in Canada now,

2537
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:09,030
even if my wife,
my wife,

2538
01:58:09,031 --> 01:58:14,031
we're paranoid.
Even if she's overestimating the threat 

2539
01:58:14,031 --> 01:58:14,940
of the risk,
the fact that she has the,

2540
01:58:14,941 --> 01:58:19,941
reflects the intuition to actually 
engage in that behavior,

2541
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:22,770
to have those thought patterns,
as you said,

2542
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:28,120
is,
is really demonstrating that the 

2543
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:30,000
canaries singing in the proverbial coal 
mine and it's not pretty right now.

2544
01:58:30,001 --> 01:58:31,230
I have two choices.
At that point.

2545
01:58:31,231 --> 01:58:33,660
I could either tweet whatever it is I 
was tweeting,

2546
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:35,310
right,
or I could say,

2547
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:35,910
yeah,
you know,

2548
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:40,940
she might be right,
let me engage in self censorship and 

2549
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:42,220
every time that someone who otherwise

2550
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:46,060
would be weighing in on the conversation
engage in self censorship,

2551
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:48,910
the other side winds,
and that's where we're at now.

2552
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,550
So to answer your question,
how do we resolve this issue?

2553
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:56,460
Hopefully people grow a pair a and start
weighing in on the matter.

2554
01:58:56,490 --> 01:59:01,490
Well,
it wasn't that one of the arguments 

2555
01:59:01,490 --> 01:59:02,911
about publishing the images from Charlie
Hebdo that no one wanted to do exactly 

2556
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:08,380
that.
Astonishing these people lost their 

2557
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:10,000
lives and the fight of a fundamental 
right,

2558
01:59:10,001 --> 01:59:14,230
the foundational bedrock of all our 
freedoms is freedom of speech.

2559
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:19,350
They lost their lives defending that and
every single western media coward and 

2560
01:59:20,471 --> 01:59:23,350
decided not to show it in every single 
one.

2561
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:25,210
I mean pretty much every single one.
Yeah.

2562
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:28,420
Every single magazines.
I mean New York Times didn't last treats

2563
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:30,060
titled in the time did it.
I mean,

2564
01:59:30,070 --> 01:59:31,180
nobody did.
Right?

2565
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:36,360
As a matter of fact,
there's one guy as relevant and Canada 

2566
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:40,170
who,
who published the original in 2006 and 

2567
01:59:40,170 --> 01:59:42,820
he was taken to a hate speech tribunal 
in Canada.

2568
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:43,840
Right.
I mean,

2569
01:59:43,841 --> 01:59:48,841
think about it.
How or William is that a guy could be 

2570
01:59:48,841 --> 01:59:51,250
taken to a hate speech tribunal for 
publishing these cartoons.

2571
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:56,230
It's astonishing is supposedly the 
cartoons are offensive.

2572
01:59:56,231 --> 01:59:59,650
I've seen some of the cartoons and I 
just thought they were kind of stupid,

2573
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:03,360
you know,
they seem a little on the racist side,

2574
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:08,370
some of them,
but the idea that these kids get you 

2575
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:10,440
fucking killed.
Do you want me to show you the cartoons 

2576
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,841
that are published every day in the 
Middle East media about Jews couldn't 

2577
02:00:12,841 --> 02:00:13,600
have managed care,
so you know what I mean?

2578
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:17,050
Now the reality is we should all try to 
get along.

2579
02:00:17,051 --> 02:00:18,940
We should all be respectful of one 
another.

2580
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:22,930
You shouldn't go out of your way to harm
other people's feelings,

2581
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:26,830
but when it comes to testing the 
boundaries of freedom of speech,

2582
02:00:26,831 --> 02:00:29,470
there should be no boundaries that can't
be crossed.

2583
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:31,930
Yeah,
there should be.

2584
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:34,070
There should be.
There should be no boundaries.

2585
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:35,170
It should be okay,
I mean,

2586
02:00:35,250 --> 02:00:36,470
I agree with you,
but when the,

2587
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:40,000
when these things come up where your 
life is at stake,

2588
02:00:40,001 --> 02:00:42,640
like your wife hanging over your 
shoulder saying,

2589
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:47,940
remember we have children and these 
people that have no time magazine,

2590
02:00:48,161 --> 02:00:50,620
that Own New York Times,
Los Angeles Times,

2591
02:00:50,621 --> 02:00:54,400
they think about publishing these things
and they just back off.

2592
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:56,320
They back off.
They have families,

2593
02:00:56,321 --> 02:01:01,321
they have lives.
They don't want to be the sacrificial 

2594
02:01:01,321 --> 02:01:03,631
lamb.
They have to put a name to those 

2595
02:01:03,631 --> 02:01:03,970
articles and they publish them and they 
know that the editor knows,

2596
02:01:03,971 --> 02:01:08,971
the publisher knows.
They all know that someone's going to 

2597
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:08,971
find out who they are.
And that's crazy,

2598
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:09,490
right?
Look,

2599
02:01:09,491 --> 02:01:11,200
I understand that pragmatism,
but,

2600
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:14,320
but we all have to weigh in,
in some form or another.

2601
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,820
And they failed.
They failed,

2602
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:16,930
they failed.
They failed.

2603
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:20,110
Free speech.
Took a big blow to the Charlie Hebdo.

2604
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:21,940
I don't know if you know this.
Now here's the kicker.

2605
02:01:21,941 --> 02:01:23,650
You want to talk about Chutzpah,
right?

2606
02:01:24,610 --> 02:01:25,750
Sure.
So,

2607
02:01:25,890 --> 02:01:27,230
uh,
one of,

2608
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:31,090
I can't remember the organization,
one of the sort of Islamic organizations

2609
02:01:31,091 --> 02:01:36,091
in the US gave an Islamophobia award to 
the slain Charlie Hebdo folks.

2610
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:45,170
So not only the dose people die for 
drawing cartoons,

2611
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:49,370
they were,
they were smeared post mortem.

2612
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:51,130
I mean it's,
it's,

2613
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:55,160
it's a level of diabolical grotesqueness
that's unimaginable,

2614
02:01:55,161 --> 02:01:56,580
right?
I mean let,

2615
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:58,380
let them,
at least in piece,

2616
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:04,300
right?
So this is a real big battle of ideas 

2617
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:05,120
and we all have to weigh in on it

2618
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:10,350
and I think that there's a lot of folks 
that do not want to die like that and 

2619
02:02:10,350 --> 02:02:14,131
they also don't want to be confused with
those folks that were drawing these 

2620
02:02:14,131 --> 02:02:18,781
cartoons.
They don't want to be lumped in in any 

2621
02:02:18,781 --> 02:02:18,781
way,
shape or form.

2622
02:02:18,781 --> 02:02:19,720
So they will come out against it.
Allah,

2623
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:24,990
Ben Affleck in very strong fashion.
They will let everyone know that they 

2624
02:02:25,811 --> 02:02:27,270
are not on that team.
Yes,

2625
02:02:27,490 --> 02:02:30,780
they do think it's racist without any 
consideration whatsoever for the,

2626
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:34,680
the,
the overall effect of those words of,

2627
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:39,580
of calling something like that.
Islamophobic or what is Islamophobic?

2628
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:44,590
What you're talking about,
a fear of an ideology that is so rigid,

2629
02:02:45,791 --> 02:02:48,730
they'll kill you for a cartoon that 
doesn't scare you.

2630
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:51,700
You're not phobic of that.
It seems to me,

2631
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:53,560
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be 
Muslim,

2632
02:02:53,590 --> 02:02:58,590
it should be whatever the fuck you want,
but as soon as it comes down to killing 

2633
02:02:58,590 --> 02:03:01,831
people over cartoons,
we have a very weird problem on our 

2634
02:03:01,831 --> 02:03:01,831
hands.
Right?

2635
02:03:01,831 --> 02:03:05,840
And when we're dealing with an entire 
chunk of the western world that thinks 

2636
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:06,690
that that's okay,
that,

2637
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:08,470
that,
that should be overlooked,

2638
02:03:08,471 --> 02:03:11,140
but you can shit all over.
Christians are shit all over.

2639
02:03:11,141 --> 02:03:15,010
Mormons are shit all over anybody else.
It's safe and it's okay.

2640
02:03:15,070 --> 02:03:16,030
Well,
book of Mormons,

2641
02:03:16,031 --> 02:03:17,120
right?
Think about the play.

2642
02:03:17,810 --> 02:03:18,060
I mean,

2643
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:23,350
people pay money to go and watch actors 
making fun openly about her religion.

2644
02:03:26,030 --> 02:03:27,890
Try to do that with one particular 
religions.

2645
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:29,840
Try to do the book of Koran,
right?

2646
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:30,630
Try that out.
Right?

2647
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:35,640
So I mean,
I don't know if you've heard the term 

2648
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:37,931
bigotry of lowered expectations.
Are there are different versions of 

2649
02:03:37,931 --> 02:03:38,210
bigotry,
of softened expectations?

2650
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:43,250
The idea is that somehow Islam should 
not be held to the same standard as 

2651
02:03:45,321 --> 02:03:48,260
every other ideology because you know,
they'll go crazy what?

2652
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:50,240
That that itself is racist,
right?

2653
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:50,990
I mean,
right.

2654
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:56,170
So when I gave you earlier the example 
of the Iraqi scientists who said that 

2655
02:03:56,170 --> 02:03:56,410
the earth is flat,
right?

2656
02:03:56,430 --> 02:03:57,650
And the,
and the lady writes to me,

2657
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:59,600
well,
why are you criticizing this guy?

2658
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:01,670
She's actually racist,
right?

2659
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:06,820
Because she's saying that somehow this 
guy doesn't have the capacity to be 

2660
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:10,931
criticized.
Whereas when I criticize the rabbi that 

2661
02:04:10,931 --> 02:04:11,270
I went to visit,
this is a true story.

2662
02:04:11,271 --> 02:04:14,810
I was invited to a rabbi's House for 
Shabbat Dinner,

2663
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:17,600
Sabbath dinner,
and as I entered the house,

2664
02:04:17,601 --> 02:04:19,100
he introduces me to everybody and says,
well,

2665
02:04:19,101 --> 02:04:20,350
this a,
this is a professor,

2666
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:20,630
blah,
blah,

2667
02:04:20,631 --> 02:04:21,860
blah.
He studies evolution,

2668
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:24,470
but everybody knows that evolution has 
been falsified.

2669
02:04:24,471 --> 02:04:26,180
So I'm not sure what he studies.
Right?

2670
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:26,930
Well,
that,

2671
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:31,280
that guy was being an idiot right now,
how come when I criticize this rabbi,

2672
02:04:31,580 --> 02:04:35,690
it's perfectly fair game.
How come when I criticize the Republican

2673
02:04:35,691 --> 02:04:38,070
senator who denies evolution because

2674
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,620
of his Christian faith?
Because he's a young earth creationist,

2675
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:45,890
that's perfectly fair,
but if I criticize the Iraquis 

2676
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:47,490
astronomer because he believes that the 
earth is flat,

2677
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:50,370
that's racist.
Well,

2678
02:04:50,371 --> 02:04:53,540
it's human folly.
You know exactly what it is.

2679
02:04:53,541 --> 02:04:53,960
I mean,
we.

2680
02:04:53,961 --> 02:04:58,961
We're in a very weird predicament with 
this one very large segment of our 

2681
02:04:59,071 --> 02:05:01,080
population on this planet.
I mean,

2682
02:05:01,090 --> 02:05:03,660
we're talking about a billion people.
One point six,

2683
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:06,420
one point six point six.
That's a large chunk.

2684
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:08,820
God Damn.
That's a lot of fucking people.

2685
02:05:09,050 --> 02:05:09,860
Now Do,
do,

2686
02:05:09,930 --> 02:05:12,840
do you see,
how do you see the trajectories of Alpha

2687
02:05:12,841 --> 02:05:17,841
brand?
Do you see this ever the pendulum 

2688
02:05:17,841 --> 02:05:17,841
swinging the other way?
What would you,

2689
02:05:17,841 --> 02:05:22,670
what do you think would be the catalyst 
to redress some of this ground folly at 

2690
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:28,760
go ahead.
Psychedelic drugs for real thing that's 

2691
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:29,220
going to work.
They need to talk to the real God.

2692
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,650
Have a real conversation with homeboy,
right?

2693
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:37,130
And the.
And the only way to get to him is 

2694
02:05:37,130 --> 02:05:37,130
through psychedelic drugs.
I think that's the best way.

2695
02:05:37,130 --> 02:05:39,000
Okay.
It gets your rice,

2696
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:44,020
almond atheist,
because I've never taken a psychiatric 

2697
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:44,020
drugs.
Psychedelics.

2698
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:45,940
That was the kind of thing you never.
Here's,

2699
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:48,210
here's something.
I've never taken any drugs.

2700
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:50,430
I've never smoked a single cigarette in 
my life.

2701
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:51,330
Wow.
Mike,

2702
02:05:51,331 --> 02:05:53,520
what about you get drunk?
Very,

2703
02:05:53,521 --> 02:05:55,740
very rarely.
As a matter of fact,

2704
02:05:55,741 --> 02:06:00,741
the first time I ever drank,
I used to be a very competitive soccer 

2705
02:06:00,741 --> 02:06:01,260
player.
I was maybe 22.

2706
02:06:01,261 --> 02:06:04,800
I had very long hair.
Very proud of my son Sonia and hair.

2707
02:06:05,450 --> 02:06:08,370
A bunch of soccer players on my team 
held me down,

2708
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:13,850
brought scissors,
put out your hair and they said you 

2709
02:06:13,850 --> 02:06:15,870
either drink today or the hairs off.
That was the first time I ever drank.

2710
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:17,760
I must've been 21,
22.

2711
02:06:19,050 --> 02:06:24,050
So.
So my only vice has been maybe my a 

2712
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:24,570
dietary choices,
but you still drink occasionally.

2713
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:25,920
Occasionally we'll.
That's a drug,

2714
02:06:25,921 --> 02:06:28,440
right?
So how can you say you don't do drugs?

2715
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:32,460
You know what I mean,
but I don't come on.

2716
02:06:32,461 --> 02:06:37,461
That's just as as much of a blinder is 
religion is the idea that you don't 

2717
02:06:37,461 --> 02:06:40,890
perturb your consciousness through a 
very distinct method.

2718
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:45,920
Right.
I have a glass of wine and get fucked 

2719
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:46,110
up.
You throw them back,

2720
02:06:46,111 --> 02:06:48,810
you get crazy smashed glasses inside the
chimney.

2721
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:54,530
If my wife is watching right now,
she does have a photo of me drunk on a 

2722
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,000
absence.
No,

2723
02:06:57,001 --> 02:07:02,001
no.
We were at Club Med and I had drank too 

2724
02:07:02,001 --> 02:07:04,590
much and I'm totally sloshed.
So that photo exists somewhere,

2725
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:08,260
so maybe she'll just club med.
So maybe this bastard,

2726
02:07:08,270 --> 02:07:08,890
right?
Right.

2727
02:07:08,910 --> 02:07:10,530
To her.
Maybe she'll release it on twitter.

2728
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:12,670
Um,
there's,

2729
02:07:12,690 --> 02:07:16,020
I think there's certain psychedelic 
drugs that could help people,

2730
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:21,140
uh,
alter their perceptions of this world 

2731
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:21,140
and give you a reset.
And that's what they do.

2732
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:24,120
I mean,
I think is a very long conversation that

2733
02:07:24,121 --> 02:07:29,121
I've had many,
many times on this podcast and we could 

2734
02:07:29,121 --> 02:07:30,120
have it some other time maybe if you 
would like to off air or whatever,

2735
02:07:30,121 --> 02:07:35,121
but there are,
there are psychedelic drugs that are 

2736
02:07:35,121 --> 02:07:36,100
most likely the of all religious

2737
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:37,420
experiences.
In fact,

2738
02:07:37,421 --> 02:07:41,650
there's a scholar out of Jerusalem.
I'm pretty famous guy.

2739
02:07:41,651 --> 02:07:45,730
I forget the argument,
but what he's essentially saying is that

2740
02:07:45,731 --> 02:07:50,731
the burning Bush that Moses described 
was most likely the acacia tree or the 

2741
02:07:52,730 --> 02:07:55,330
Acacia Bush,
which is very rich dimethyltryptamine,

2742
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:58,090
which is the most potent psychedelic 
drug known to man.

2743
02:07:58,390 --> 02:08:03,390
And I've experienced this particular 
drug and this particular drug gives you 

2744
02:08:03,390 --> 02:08:07,651
a very intense feeling of joining with 
the mother,

2745
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:10,860
with communicating with God,
with,

2746
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:15,950
with,
with getting in contact with some 

2747
02:08:15,950 --> 02:08:17,710
intelligent power,
some intelligent mind,

2748
02:08:17,711 --> 02:08:22,711
something that is above and beyond what 
exists in our normal dimension that we 

2749
02:08:24,041 --> 02:08:29,041
exist in and it's filled with complex 
geometric patterns and communicate with 

2750
02:08:29,351 --> 02:08:31,810
you telepathically.
It is a very,

2751
02:08:31,811 --> 02:08:36,811
very crazy experience.
And one of the things that happens in 

2752
02:08:36,811 --> 02:08:40,741
these dmt trips is that they give you 
like lessons of how to live life.

2753
02:08:42,910 --> 02:08:45,060
And the lessons all seem to row there.

2754
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:47,270
You never have like these psychedelic 
dmt trip.

2755
02:08:47,271 --> 02:08:52,271
So they tell you what you need to do is 
rape more and beat the fuck out of 

2756
02:08:52,271 --> 02:08:52,300
people and steal as much shit as you 
can.

2757
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:55,780
It's more like love,
like love people.

2758
02:08:55,781 --> 02:08:58,000
Love you,
love the love yourself,

2759
02:08:58,001 --> 02:09:01,630
love everyone around you because don't 
worry about all the bullshit,

2760
02:09:01,631 --> 02:09:03,640
just being nice to each other.
Just have fun.

2761
02:09:03,641 --> 02:09:07,750
Just enjoy it.
Spread it and don't lie.

2762
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:09,400
Don't lie,
don't deceive,

2763
02:09:09,401 --> 02:09:12,610
don't deceive yourself,
don't deceive anyone else and don't,

2764
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:17,670
don't lose perspective.
You're going to be here and then you're 

2765
02:09:17,670 --> 02:09:20,791
going to be there and you're going to be
here and you're going to be there and 

2766
02:09:20,791 --> 02:09:22,240
it's going to go on and on and on.
It's this perpetual cycle that continues

2767
02:09:22,241 --> 02:09:27,241
from birth to death through infinity 
infant testimony.

2768
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:32,300
Part of an endless cycle,
and this is the experience in a 

2769
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:32,300
nutshell.

2770
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:37,230
This is what you get out of it and very 
similar to the idea that you would come 

2771
02:09:37,391 --> 02:09:39,700
out of this experience with a set of 
tenants,

2772
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:42,520
set of rules like most this commandment.
Sure.

2773
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:47,820
It totally makes sense that Moses could 
be this guy who was into smoking dmt and

2774
02:09:48,071 --> 02:09:48,880
telling people,
look,

2775
02:09:48,881 --> 02:09:53,881
we're fucking up.
We're having all these sword fights and 

2776
02:09:53,881 --> 02:09:56,010
shooting arrows at each other and 
poisoning our neighbors threats from a 

2777
02:09:56,010 --> 02:09:58,370
Jewish extremists though I doubt it 
because this guy in Israel,

2778
02:09:58,810 --> 02:10:03,810
I know you are,
but this guy in Israel Sivia find a and 

2779
02:10:03,810 --> 02:10:07,190
find that article,
but it was a pretty interesting paper 

2780
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:07,190
because this is a,
you know,

2781
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:09,970
a real academic who is basing this on 
years of research.

2782
02:10:09,990 --> 02:10:14,990
Well,
isn't it the case that many religious 

2783
02:10:14,990 --> 02:10:18,151
rituals of various cultures engage in 
these types of consumer authority 

2784
02:10:18,151 --> 02:10:18,670
behaviors?
We absolutely,

2785
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:21,820
as part of their religious rituals,
correct wasn't matter of fact,

2786
02:10:21,821 --> 02:10:25,000
John Marco Allegro,
who is one of the main,

2787
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:30,050
um,
scholars that was assigned to decipher 

2788
02:10:30,050 --> 02:10:30,490
the Dead Sea Scrolls,
which is the oldest version of the Bible

2789
02:10:30,491 --> 02:10:31,120
known right.

2790
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:35,300
Um,
and also I the only version in Aramaic,

2791
02:10:35,301 --> 02:10:40,301
it was found in these clay pots and 
Qumran in 1940 something.

2792
02:10:41,241 --> 02:10:43,490
It took forever for them to decipher 
these things.

2793
02:10:43,491 --> 02:10:48,491
And this Guy John Marco Allegro,
worked on them for 14 plus years and he 

2794
02:10:49,551 --> 02:10:53,150
was the only agnostic on the committee 
that was assigned to decipher it.

2795
02:10:53,151 --> 02:10:58,151
He was originally an ordained minister.
And over time he became disenchanted 

2796
02:10:58,611 --> 02:11:03,611
with the idea of religion when they 
found all these contradictions and 

2797
02:11:03,611 --> 02:11:04,460
religion and these comparisons to other 
texts.

2798
02:11:04,461 --> 02:11:06,800
And he realized that a lot of it's 
probably bullshit.

2799
02:11:07,070 --> 02:11:10,700
And so he wrote a book called the sacred
mushroom and the cross.

2800
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:14,270
And after 14 years of deciphering the 
Dead Sea Scrolls,

2801
02:11:14,271 --> 02:11:19,271
it was his interpretation that the 
entire Christian religion was a massive 

2802
02:11:19,271 --> 02:11:22,811
misunderstanding that what it was 
originally about was the consumption of 

2803
02:11:22,811 --> 02:11:25,070
psychedelic mushrooms and fertility 
rituals.

2804
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:27,380
Wow.
And that it was a fertility cult because

2805
02:11:27,381 --> 02:11:28,580
back then it was all about.

2806
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:33,580
It wasn't about birth control,
it was about get pregnant because 

2807
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:37,030
there's not many of us.
We need more and the Romans might 

2808
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:37,030
becoming and in my fucking kill 
everybody,

2809
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:41,951
women need warriors.
We're going to need a large group of us 

2810
02:11:41,951 --> 02:11:42,290
and we can't let them know about these 
mushrooms.

2811
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:47,620
And he even traced the Etymology of the 
word Christ to an ancient Sumerian word 

2812
02:11:49,881 --> 02:11:53,860
that meant a mushroom covered in God's 
semen and what,

2813
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:55,670
what they,
what they thought was,

2814
02:11:55,671 --> 02:12:00,671
according to John Marco Allegro,
what they thought was that when it 

2815
02:12:00,671 --> 02:12:02,510
rained,
that was god coming on the world,

2816
02:12:02,910 --> 02:12:07,910
Kinda like a cosmic cosmic money shot.
And that these mushrooms would grow out 

2817
02:12:10,101 --> 02:12:10,820
of the ground.
Like,

2818
02:12:10,821 --> 02:12:14,030
you know how it is when you have a rain 
and then you go outside in the morning,

2819
02:12:14,031 --> 02:12:15,380
you see mushrooms that are already 
grown,

2820
02:12:15,381 --> 02:12:17,480
like they weren't even there last night 
and now they're there.

2821
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:22,660
They grow so quickly and then you would 
find these and they would eat these and 

2822
02:12:22,671 --> 02:12:25,940
have these intense psychedelic 
experiences of course.

2823
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:28,910
And so if you.
Okay,

2824
02:12:28,911 --> 02:12:29,330
hold on,
sorry.

2825
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:34,660
So we'll leave it up.
Leave it up so that these people that 

2826
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:39,131
would experience these would have these 
intense transformative trips and without

2827
02:12:39,651 --> 02:12:44,651
any science,
without any knowledge of what the 

2828
02:12:44,651 --> 02:12:46,661
components of these mushrooms are,
which is very similar by the way to 

2829
02:12:46,661 --> 02:12:50,451
human neurochemistry.
DMT is nn dimethyltryptamine and that 

2830
02:12:50,571 --> 02:12:55,571
exists in the human brain.
It's produced by the liver and the 

2831
02:12:55,571 --> 02:12:58,841
lungs.
And they have now have proven due to 

2832
02:12:58,841 --> 02:12:59,270
this guy,
Dr Rick strassman's work.

2833
02:12:59,271 --> 02:13:01,670
He wrote this great book called Dmt the 
spirit molecule.

2834
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:06,830
He's a professor at the University of 
New Mexico and Got Dea approved clinical

2835
02:13:06,831 --> 02:13:10,040
track tests on subjects using dmt.
And,

2836
02:13:10,041 --> 02:13:11,810
uh,
this cottonwood research foundation that

2837
02:13:11,811 --> 02:13:16,811
he helped start,
has proven that it's produced in the 

2838
02:13:16,811 --> 02:13:17,990
pineal gland of live rats and the,
what?

2839
02:13:17,991 --> 02:13:22,991
The pineal gland is the third eye.
It's in reptile that actually has let a 

2840
02:13:22,991 --> 02:13:23,990
retina and the Lens,
I mean,

2841
02:13:23,991 --> 02:13:28,991
it literally is in the center of the 
brain where the third eye is in eastern 

2842
02:13:28,991 --> 02:13:32,951
mysticism.
It's producing this intense psychedelic 

2843
02:13:32,951 --> 02:13:32,951
drug.

2844
02:13:32,951 --> 02:13:37,220
And that's what this Hebrew University 
researcher Moses was tripping at Mount 

2845
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:38,070
Sinai is,
I mean,

2846
02:13:38,071 --> 02:13:43,071
is he high?
Obviously they'll know this literature 

2847
02:13:43,071 --> 02:13:43,820
is he viewed it as a sort of outlier,
quack.

2848
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:48,910
You would have to research it and find 
out more about it because I did a 

2849
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:50,400
cursory examination because I'm so 
familiar with the drug and it only makes

2850
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:52,320
sense to me.
Um,

2851
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:53,280
this is,
uh,

2852
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:56,600
he visited the Amazon and drink Iowasca 
and uh,

2853
02:13:56,730 --> 02:14:00,630
he has this idea of that,
that is what this was probably all about

2854
02:14:00,631 --> 02:14:04,410
because Iowasca has been,
they believe it's very difficult to find

2855
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:06,210
out what,
when the,

2856
02:14:06,350 --> 02:14:11,350
uh,
the Amazonian indigenous people were 

2857
02:14:11,350 --> 02:14:14,451
drinking this brew.
But IOWASCA is a form of DMT and much 

2858
02:14:14,451 --> 02:14:17,700
like the acacia bushes,
very rich and dmt thousands of plants or

2859
02:14:17,701 --> 02:14:19,140
Richmond Dmt,
DMT,

2860
02:14:19,230 --> 02:14:20,310
existence.
Lance.

2861
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:23,100
Sorry.
But what they're doing with this Iowasca

2862
02:14:23,101 --> 02:14:27,150
is an orally active version of dmt 
because it has,

2863
02:14:27,151 --> 02:14:30,360
um,
it has one plant that has dmt in another

2864
02:14:30,361 --> 02:14:34,410
plant that has something called an Mao 
inhibitor because dmt is broken down the

2865
02:14:34,411 --> 02:14:36,660
gut by something called Mano Amy,
not oxidase.

2866
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,060
Cool.
A Gino.

2867
02:14:39,061 --> 02:14:42,720
This ritual,
one of the Amazonian tribes.

2868
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:45,210
I discussed this,
one of my books with the bullet ants.

2869
02:14:45,211 --> 02:14:46,410
Are you familiar this?
Yeah.

2870
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:51,600
Incredible.
I mean for mean just mentioned briefly 

2871
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:54,111
for your viewers who might not know it 
because I think they drink some 

2872
02:14:54,111 --> 02:14:54,111
psychotropic.
Yeah,

2873
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:59,220
I think they do.
I think it might be a tumor or 

2874
02:14:59,220 --> 02:14:59,220
something.
One of those.

2875
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:02,600
There's a bunch of different crazy 
psychedelic drugs that they take down 

2876
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:02,600
there.
But apparently.

2877
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:03,680
So they,
they basically have to.

2878
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:06,900
They,
they sedate these bullets pants.

2879
02:15:07,490 --> 02:15:09,370
And then they were these smoke,
right?

2880
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:14,420
Which spoke.
And then they wear these gloves were 

2881
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:18,051
they then sort of weave the ants into 
the glove as the ants come out of their 

2882
02:15:18,901 --> 02:15:23,250
stupor,
they start biting the wearer.

2883
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:26,020
Now,
one bite from that ad,

2884
02:15:26,021 --> 02:15:29,220
I mean it's called bullet pad because 
the pain is greater than if you were hit

2885
02:15:29,221 --> 02:15:29,790
by a bullet.

2886
02:15:30,030 --> 02:15:31,880
Apparently it's the highest,
you know,

2887
02:15:32,190 --> 02:15:37,190
pain and do same thing in nature and 
they have to do it 20 times on different

2888
02:15:40,741 --> 02:15:43,680
occasions before there's sort of 
accepted into manhood or whatever,

2889
02:15:43,681 --> 02:15:45,120
the gds.
But,

2890
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:45,780
but I mean,
the,

2891
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:50,800
the point that,
the link to your story is that I think 

2892
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:51,310
they're under some psychotropics.
Uh,

2893
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:52,670
yeah.
Here it is.

2894
02:15:52,671 --> 02:15:57,671
Those admits.
My friend Steve was bitten by a bullet 

2895
02:15:57,671 --> 02:15:57,671
ant.
Really?

2896
02:15:57,671 --> 02:15:57,671
Bolivia.
Yeah.

2897
02:15:57,671 --> 02:15:59,250
He got bitten on his heel.
He said it was unbelievably painful.

2898
02:15:59,251 --> 02:16:01,710
They said it lasted for hours too,
he said,

2899
02:16:01,711 --> 02:16:03,510
but he said when it was over,
it was really weird.

2900
02:16:03,790 --> 02:16:08,790
It was so painful that he was delusional
and he couldn't even remember which 

2901
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:11,991
he'll got bit crafter.
It was over because once it subsided it 

2902
02:16:11,991 --> 02:16:15,510
was like he like woke up from a transfer
credit and he said it was really,

2903
02:16:15,511 --> 02:16:20,511
really painful.
That's really difficult to concentrate 

2904
02:16:20,511 --> 02:16:20,700
on anything.
This slightly less spiritual.

2905
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:25,940
Can we segue from the money shots to an 
actual study on money shots on sperm?

2906
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:27,060
Yes.
Yes,

2907
02:16:27,170 --> 02:16:29,040
and I at the reason why I thought about 
this,

2908
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:30,110
because I know that in your own

2909
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:35,150
Scada,
fucking one track mind because I know 

2910
02:16:35,150 --> 02:16:38,481
that by the way,
thank you very much for inviting me to 

2911
02:16:38,481 --> 02:16:39,520
your show in Montreal and to the the 
UFC.

2912
02:16:39,521 --> 02:16:40,990
That was really fun.
I'm glad you had a good time.

2913
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:43,720
And so when,
when I was at your show with my wife,

2914
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:46,450
I think you had a little bit on sperm.
I can't remember what it was.

2915
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:47,450
I'm sure I did.
Yeah.

2916
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:52,720
Anyways,
I think I might've sent you a direct 

2917
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:53,710
message that kind of spoke to some of 
the issues that you raised.

2918
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:58,800
So here we go.
Let's talk about the science of sperm 

2919
02:16:58,800 --> 02:16:58,920
and porn.
Get ready.

2920
02:16:58,930 --> 02:17:02,800
Yes.
So this was a study done a few years ago

2921
02:17:02,801 --> 02:17:07,801
by some colleagues of mine where they 
wanted to look at the content of porno 

2922
02:17:08,381 --> 02:17:13,381
movies.
So if you think of the typical male 

2923
02:17:13,381 --> 02:17:13,690
fantasy at men who wants to have sex 
with many women,

2924
02:17:13,691 --> 02:17:13,870
right?

2925
02:17:13,870 --> 02:17:17,800
So most societies are polygynous,
meaning one man with multiple women,

2926
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:19,720
right?
That's how it should be.

2927
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:21,970
God dammit to hell.
Most societies,

2928
02:17:22,030 --> 02:17:24,010
most societies,
85 percent of societies,

2929
02:17:24,390 --> 02:17:27,150
uh,
have historically condoned polygyny.

2930
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:28,040
Oh,
what the fuck.

2931
02:17:28,210 --> 02:17:30,250
By the way,
people wrongly say polygamy.

2932
02:17:30,670 --> 02:17:35,670
Polygamy just means one with many.
But polygyny is one man with many women.

2933
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:39,880
Polyandry is one woman with many men.
So,

2934
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,140
so stay with.
That's horseshit.

2935
02:17:43,670 --> 02:17:44,470
They are very,
very.

2936
02:17:44,570 --> 02:17:46,240
There are very few societies that have 
that.

2937
02:17:47,770 --> 02:17:50,790
I've been telling everybody that's Jamie
because of paternity uncertainty about,

2938
02:17:50,810 --> 02:17:51,490
oh,
of course.

2939
02:17:51,491 --> 02:17:52,810
Right?
So here it goes.

2940
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:55,240
So,
so polygyny is what men want.

2941
02:17:55,390 --> 02:17:56,590
One,
basically,

2942
02:17:56,591 --> 02:17:58,300
heroin building,
one man with many women.

2943
02:17:58,510 --> 02:18:03,510
Yet,
if you do a content analysis of porn 

2944
02:18:03,510 --> 02:18:06,001
movies,
what you find that that study has been 

2945
02:18:06,001 --> 02:18:07,570
done by a guy by the name athlete,
Nicholas Pound,

2946
02:18:07,930 --> 02:18:10,340
uh,
that,

2947
02:18:10,890 --> 02:18:12,040
that's a shout out to this guy.

2948
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:17,040
He owes me now.
So he did a content analysis where he 

2949
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:20,350
showed that polyandrous depictions are 
much more common and porn movies,

2950
02:18:20,351 --> 02:18:24,280
meaning one woman with multiple men,
right?

2951
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:25,930
Okay.
And so these.

2952
02:18:26,170 --> 02:18:29,310
And he argued basically that the reason 
for that is because it's,

2953
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:32,230
it's an excitatory q for sperm 
competition.

2954
02:18:32,590 --> 02:18:34,270
Okay.
So watch this now.

2955
02:18:34,730 --> 02:18:39,730
Uh,
so then these other researchers came 

2956
02:18:39,730 --> 02:18:39,730
along and said,
well,

2957
02:18:39,730 --> 02:18:40,590
how could we test this?
So what they did is basically they,

2958
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:45,760
they asked men to take one of two images
home either with women having sex or one

2959
02:18:47,801 --> 02:18:49,660
woman with multiple guys,
polyandry,

2960
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:55,290
and then masturbate to those images and 
then bring back their sperm to the lab 

2961
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:58,390
to be evaluated,
or as I like to say,

2962
02:18:58,391 --> 02:19:01,990
the fruits of their manual labor and the
guests.

2963
02:19:01,991 --> 02:19:06,991
What they found that the sperm that 
originated from the masturbations to 

2964
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:12,130
polyandrous images were much more,
had greater motility.

2965
02:19:12,550 --> 02:19:13,720
In other words,
they were more vigorous,

2966
02:19:13,721 --> 02:19:17,710
they moved a lot more which supported 
the idea of sperm competition,

2967
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:23,010
and this is exactly what you get an 
animal husbandry right when you want 

2968
02:19:23,010 --> 02:19:26,100
your stud to be riled up to have sex,
you often will show another male having 

2969
02:19:27,591 --> 02:19:30,590
sex with a female and then this will get
a rise out of him.

2970
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:32,720
So this explains the,
if you like,

2971
02:19:32,721 --> 02:19:37,721
the disconnect between how come men are 
so desirous to have sex with many women 

2972
02:19:37,721 --> 02:19:42,490
at once and yet you will,
and then that's what you would think 

2973
02:19:42,490 --> 02:19:42,490
would be the picture.
That informal reason,

2974
02:19:42,490 --> 02:19:44,150
that's not what you get.
You get a lot more of two,

2975
02:19:44,151 --> 02:19:49,151
three guys on one woman,
so now I have elucidated the mysteries 

2976
02:19:49,151 --> 02:19:49,400
of porn for you.

2977
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:54,680
That makes sense on a biological level 
because the more promiscuous the females

2978
02:19:55,111 --> 02:19:56,370
are around,
man,

2979
02:19:56,371 --> 02:19:59,630
the larger their testicles are testing 
language,

2980
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:02,580
right?
The testicles grow and they produce more

2981
02:20:02,581 --> 02:20:04,170
sperm because of the competition.

2982
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:05,560
As a matter of fact.
So that.

2983
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:10,680
Let me jump on that.
So if you look across primates at the 

2984
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:15,181
size of the testicle,
of the males of that species as a 

2985
02:20:15,181 --> 02:20:17,710
function of female promiscuity and that 
species,

2986
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:20,770
you see a perfect correlation.
So mountain gorillas,

2987
02:20:21,190 --> 02:20:22,720
little tiny balls,
little tiny Dick.

2988
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:23,770
Very good,
right?

2989
02:20:23,771 --> 02:20:28,771
They're usually impressive,
but they have a complete sexual 

2990
02:20:28,771 --> 02:20:28,790
territoriality.
Yeah,

2991
02:20:28,791 --> 02:20:30,580
they fucked up.
They became too powerful.

2992
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:34,400
Chimps on the other hand,
massive testicle.

2993
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:35,980
They're walking testicles basically,
right?

2994
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:39,400
Precisely because it's an adaptation to 
female promiscuity.

2995
02:20:39,401 --> 02:20:43,240
Within that species.
Humans are closer to the chimp.

2996
02:20:43,370 --> 02:20:48,370
End of the scale for care.
We are now speaking about the thought 

2997
02:20:48,370 --> 02:20:48,370
police,
right?

2998
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:53,460
And all this bs stuff that you see on 
campuses when I describe those 

2999
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:57,961
particular studies,
the feminists and the crowd will be 

3000
02:20:57,961 --> 02:21:01,380
very,
very pleased because then I'm 

3001
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:01,540
demonstrating that women can be 
promiscuous,

3002
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:03,610
that fits the narrative of feminism.

3003
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:05,650
If on the other hand,
uh,

3004
02:21:05,651 --> 02:21:07,810
I might five minutes later say,
yeah,

3005
02:21:07,811 --> 02:21:10,300
but when it comes to a,
uh,

3006
02:21:10,420 --> 02:21:15,420
sexual variety,
men have a slightly greater pension for 

3007
02:21:15,420 --> 02:21:17,770
sexual variety than women,
then I suddenly become Dr Mengele,

3008
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:19,300
the Nazi doctor.
So,

3009
02:21:19,420 --> 02:21:24,420
so basically the evolutionary finding 
that I discuss is either liberating to 

3010
02:21:26,321 --> 02:21:31,321
the feminist if it fits with the 
narrative or it is a form of 

3011
02:21:31,321 --> 02:21:31,321
patriarchal,
sexist,

3012
02:21:31,321 --> 02:21:36,061
bs if it doesn't fit bit,
and that again is the problem with what 

3013
02:21:36,061 --> 02:21:36,061
you see on campuses,
right?

3014
02:21:36,061 --> 02:21:37,660
Rather than an open,
honest,

3015
02:21:37,690 --> 02:21:40,780
this course about the veracity of 
scientific findings,

3016
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:44,380
we judge these findings as a function of
our pet ideology,

3017
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:48,920
the pet ideology when it comes to gender
identification and gender identities.

3018
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:54,340
I think that that's.
There's a real interesting point to be 

3019
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:54,410
made with that when it comes to science 
too,

3020
02:21:54,411 --> 02:21:59,411
because one of the things that's always 
being touted about is diversity in 

3021
02:21:59,411 --> 02:22:03,371
science and gender diversity in science.
But when it comes to what people 

3022
02:22:03,371 --> 02:22:05,690
actually want to do,
there's been studies.

3023
02:22:05,691 --> 02:22:08,660
You give a boy a certain toy or girls 
certain toy,

3024
02:22:08,661 --> 02:22:13,661
they're going to gravitate towards 
things that are more in line with their 

3025
02:22:13,661 --> 02:22:14,960
gender.
That's that fucks people up.

3026
02:22:14,961 --> 02:22:19,961
They don't want to hear that.
That some boys like trucks and some 

3027
02:22:19,961 --> 02:22:22,511
girls like dolls.
But what it should be is what do they 

3028
02:22:22,511 --> 02:22:23,420
like and guess what if the girl likes 
trucks,

3029
02:22:23,421 --> 02:22:25,890
are the boys liked dolls?
Who a fuck,

3030
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:30,000
but let's let the data speak for itself.
Let's try to understand.

3031
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:35,090
I'm so happy you mentioned toy 
preference because that's one of my 

3032
02:22:35,090 --> 02:22:37,161
favorite examples to demonstrate the 
lunacy of the whole social 

3033
02:22:37,161 --> 02:22:37,161
constructivist stuff.
So here we go.

3034
02:22:37,161 --> 02:22:42,060
Okay.
So usually in the social sciences or 

3035
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:42,740
certainly social constructive as the 
ones who argue that everything is due to

3036
02:22:42,741 --> 02:22:47,741
stress litigation will use toy 
preferences as if you like the starting 

3037
02:22:47,741 --> 02:22:49,980
point of how gender role socialization 
happens,

3038
02:22:49,981 --> 02:22:54,981
right?
Johnny is taught to play rough with the 

3039
02:22:54,981 --> 02:22:56,991
GI.
Joe then start to play nurturing with 

3040
02:22:56,991 --> 02:22:58,880
the pink doll and that starts the 
cascade of arbitrary sexist,

3041
02:22:58,980 --> 02:23:03,980
gender role socialization.
So I decided that I wanted to take that 

3042
02:23:03,980 --> 02:23:04,980
premise on and I wanted to bring data 
from a very,

3043
02:23:04,981 --> 02:23:08,490
very broad range of fields to completely
dismantled this bullshit.

3044
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:09,540
Okay.
So here we go.

3045
02:23:10,050 --> 02:23:15,050
So if you take children who are in the 
pre socialization stage of their 

3046
02:23:15,050 --> 02:23:19,761
cognitive development,
meaning that they don't yet have the 

3047
02:23:19,761 --> 02:23:19,860
capacity to be socialized and you give 
them tests,

3048
02:23:19,861 --> 02:23:21,060
let's say,
of eye gazing,

3049
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:25,800
they could either stare at adults or 
trucks or play with dolls or trucks.

3050
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:28,190
Then you already see the sex 
specificity,

3051
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:33,200
other toy preferences and the priests 
socialization stage of their cognitive 

3052
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:36,621
development,
meaning they couldn't have been 

3053
02:23:36,621 --> 02:23:36,621
socialized into those preferences.
Let's keep going.

3054
02:23:36,621 --> 02:23:40,850
If you take other species,
you take vervet monkeys and rhesus 

3055
02:23:40,850 --> 02:23:42,180
monkeys and you take infants of those 
species.

3056
02:23:42,330 --> 02:23:46,530
It replicates the sex specificity of toy
preferences of human infants.

3057
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:48,600
Let's go on.
If you take,

3058
02:23:48,930 --> 02:23:53,930
if you take a little girls who suffer 
from something called an 

3059
02:23:53,930 --> 02:23:57,210
endocrinological disorder called 
congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

3060
02:23:57,870 --> 02:24:02,870
This is a disorder that masculinize as 
little girls and masculinize as their 

3061
02:24:02,870 --> 02:24:02,870
morphology,
their,

3062
02:24:02,870 --> 02:24:02,870
their,
their,

3063
02:24:03,090 --> 02:24:08,090
their physical traits,
but it also masculinized as their 

3064
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:10,971
behaviors.
Guess what happens to their toy 

3065
02:24:10,971 --> 02:24:13,101
preferences?
They become more like little boy if you 

3066
02:24:13,101 --> 02:24:13,980
take.
If you go to Sweden,

3067
02:24:14,010 --> 02:24:15,220
which is the,
the,

3068
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:18,450
the most gender neutral country in the 
world.

3069
02:24:18,451 --> 02:24:20,360
Actually it's been studied as an iphone.

3070
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:21,900
Yeah,
gender neutral household.

3071
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:24,660
So in other words,
basically what happens in Sweden is that

3072
02:24:24,661 --> 02:24:29,661
the government has systematically tried 
to completely eradicate as a big social 

3073
02:24:29,661 --> 02:24:32,040
experiment.
Any gender markers,

3074
02:24:32,100 --> 02:24:36,590
you remove the gender pronouns,
gender Pronoun,

3075
02:24:36,790 --> 02:24:38,400
gender,
gendered pronouns.

3076
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:41,340
That's right.
That's right.

3077
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:42,900
I mean,
I don't speak Swedish,

3078
02:24:42,901 --> 02:24:46,440
but that's what I hear and there's.
There's a scale that that's developed by

3079
02:24:46,441 --> 02:24:51,441
a gentleman called hoffstead where he,
where he ranks the countries from around

3080
02:24:51,931 --> 02:24:56,931
the world on this gender score and 
Sweden is off the chart on it's 

3081
02:24:56,931 --> 02:24:57,690
femininity.
Okay.

3082
02:24:57,691 --> 02:25:02,160
It's just outrageous.
And so if you now go to that country and

3083
02:25:02,161 --> 02:25:04,350
study,
it's a perfect field experiment,

3084
02:25:04,351 --> 02:25:06,690
right?
Because they've spent 40 years trying to

3085
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:11,780
eradicate arbitrary sexist,
gender stereotypes and therefore you 

3086
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:16,671
should see that maybe the toy 
preferences would now be no longer like 

3087
02:25:16,671 --> 02:25:17,670
everywhere else.
Guess what you find in those countries,

3088
02:25:17,730 --> 02:25:22,730
it's exactly the same as anywhere else.
If you go to 3000 years ago to funerary 

3089
02:25:23,891 --> 02:25:24,100
ice

3090
02:25:24,110 --> 02:25:29,110
icon,
fear near funerary monuments where 

3091
02:25:29,110 --> 02:25:31,740
little children are depicted in ancient 
Greece and you and you study how the 

3092
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:36,211
children are depicted,
the little boys are shown with wheels 

3093
02:25:36,211 --> 02:25:36,670
and trucks and so on,
the little on our trucks,

3094
02:25:36,671 --> 02:25:40,000
but the wheelbarrow stuff and the girls 
are shown with dolls.

3095
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:43,750
You could study cultures in various 
areas of Africa.

3096
02:25:43,790 --> 02:25:48,790
Indigenous cultures as has been done by 
a French anthropologist and the exact 

3097
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:53,341
same behaviors manifest themselves so 
and that just shows you how long we've 

3098
02:25:53,341 --> 02:25:56,020
been under the oppressive thumb of the 
historical.

3099
02:25:56,050 --> 02:25:57,730
Very good at it.
That's what it is.

3100
02:25:57,731 --> 02:26:02,731
She archi,
exact mass media has been around even 

3101
02:26:02,731 --> 02:26:05,611
before then,
but how do we explain this written and 

3102
02:26:05,611 --> 02:26:05,611
clay tablets?
They were bullshitting even back then.

3103
02:26:05,611 --> 02:26:06,520
Men are assholes.
Either way.

3104
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:12,030
This this.
You know what the to the to the digit 

3105
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:12,030
ratio is.
Are you familiar with that?

3106
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:12,030
Yes.
Yes.

3107
02:26:12,190 --> 02:26:16,000
Please explain so that the two D,
four d is the is the length of the ratio

3108
02:26:16,001 --> 02:26:20,200
of your index finger to your ring finger
and at as a sexually dimorphic trait,

3109
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:25,230
meaning that men have much longer ring 
fingers than than index fingers.

3110
02:26:25,811 --> 02:26:30,811
Whereas women,
the two fingers are roughly the same 

3111
02:26:30,811 --> 02:26:33,661
length.
Why is this important to this 

3112
02:26:33,661 --> 02:26:35,071
discussion?
Because that morphological feature is 

3113
02:26:35,071 --> 02:26:38,461
actually shaped in Utero as a function 
of how much testosterone you've been 

3114
02:26:38,461 --> 02:26:39,820
exposed to in utero.
Okay.

3115
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:45,180
Therefore,
what some researchers have done is 

3116
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:47,851
they've looked at the digit ratio of 
little boys and then link that to their 

3117
02:26:49,421 --> 02:26:52,210
play pattern behaviors and again,
what do you find?

3118
02:26:52,780 --> 02:26:57,780
Little boys will have more masculinized.
The ratios have more masculinized toy 

3119
02:26:58,271 --> 02:27:00,850
preferences.
Same thing has been done by the way with

3120
02:27:00,851 --> 02:27:05,851
actually circulating testosterone.
You take seven day old children and 

3121
02:27:05,851 --> 02:27:10,261
until the six months old you measure 
their testosterone and testosterone 

3122
02:27:10,261 --> 02:27:12,130
level predicts toy preferences.

3123
02:27:12,490 --> 02:27:17,490
So look how many different disparate 
lines of evidence I've just come up with

3124
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:21,820
to demonstrate that it is not due to 
arbitrary,

3125
02:27:21,830 --> 02:27:23,080
you know,
sexist socialization.

3126
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:28,200
It's very uncomfortable for me that 
people want to ignore that and put this 

3127
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:32,371
all on cultural ideas and stereotypes 
that people subscribe to because they 

3128
02:27:33,521 --> 02:27:36,220
don't want their child to be ostracized 
by the community.

3129
02:27:36,550 --> 02:27:36,970
It's,
it's,

3130
02:27:36,971 --> 02:27:38,410
uh,
it was very uncomfortable for me.

3131
02:27:38,411 --> 02:27:43,411
It,
it drives me nuts because I think it 

3132
02:27:43,411 --> 02:27:45,451
fucks people's heads up to us because 
then they feel like there's something 

3133
02:27:45,451 --> 02:27:45,520
wrong with them for liking masculine 
things.

3134
02:27:45,521 --> 02:27:50,521
Right?
And being masculine or liking masculine 

3135
02:27:50,521 --> 02:27:53,461
thing seems less and less of a favorable
pursuit in 2015 and it's kind of I've 

3136
02:27:53,710 --> 02:27:58,710
ever been before.
It's like men get kind of shit on in 

3137
02:27:58,710 --> 02:27:59,740
this society because we get blamed for a
lot of things.

3138
02:27:59,741 --> 02:28:00,640
And,
and um,

3139
02:28:00,650 --> 02:28:05,650
and I'm not saying poor men and women 
because I think being a man is pretty 

3140
02:28:05,650 --> 02:28:05,650
fucking bad ass.
I like it,

3141
02:28:05,650 --> 02:28:10,620
I enjoy it.
But I just also don't think that we're 

3142
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:10,620
necessarily evil either,
right?

3143
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:12,250
I mean,
if some men do evil shit,

3144
02:28:12,251 --> 02:28:17,251
it doesn't mean that men are evil.
And if boys like trucks or girls like 

3145
02:28:17,251 --> 02:28:22,231
dolls,
it doesn't mean anything wrong with 

3146
02:28:22,231 --> 02:28:22,231
either one of them,
but it is wrong.

3147
02:28:22,231 --> 02:28:22,670
We try to ascribe

3148
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:27,760
or prescribe it when we try to put that 
into some sort of an ideological box.

3149
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:34,910
Yes.
And we dismiss it or we categorize it as

3150
02:28:34,911 --> 02:28:39,911
being a part of the problem is with our 
culture when it's so clearly a natural 

3151
02:28:39,911 --> 02:28:39,911
thing.

3152
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:40,380
Well,
I,

3153
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:44,110
I think it stands this lunacy,
and I'm not sure if we discussed it last

3154
02:28:44,111 --> 02:28:49,111
time I was on the show,
but this lunacy I think comes from a 

3155
02:28:49,111 --> 02:28:52,950
good place in a idiotic place.
But the place it comes from the idea 

3156
02:28:52,950 --> 02:28:57,270
that if something is biological based,
it's immutable and,

3157
02:28:57,360 --> 02:28:58,900
and that's,
that's a scary thing,

3158
02:28:58,901 --> 02:29:03,901
right?
So people talk about biological 

3159
02:29:03,901 --> 02:29:03,901
determinism,
which is complete nonsense.

3160
02:29:03,901 --> 02:29:07,000
And so the idea of an brain being empty.
Slate.

3161
02:29:07,030 --> 02:29:12,030
How,
how's the biological determinism 

3162
02:29:12,030 --> 02:29:12,030
nonsense.
How so?

3163
02:29:12,030 --> 02:29:15,060
Because almost everything is a 
inextricable mix of your biology and 

3164
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:16,350
environmental inputs.
Uh,

3165
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:21,600
almost nothing that you could think of 
doesn't incorporate some environmental 

3166
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:26,221
input into whoever you.
So the idea of it being completely 

3167
02:29:26,221 --> 02:29:26,221
independent of any.
Exactly.

3168
02:29:26,221 --> 02:29:31,170
So the idea of nature versus nurture is 
really a silly mood dichotomy because 

3169
02:29:31,170 --> 02:29:32,920
it's a big broad spectrum of inputs.

3170
02:29:32,950 --> 02:29:37,950
Exactly.
And so the example that I left the gift 

3171
02:29:37,950 --> 02:29:38,560
to drive that point home,
some of your viewers might have heard me

3172
02:29:38,561 --> 02:29:40,270
say before,
it's the cake metaphor.

3173
02:29:40,271 --> 02:29:45,271
So if you take a cake,
you take all the ingredients of the 

3174
02:29:45,271 --> 02:29:45,271
cake.
Here's the,

3175
02:29:45,271 --> 02:29:46,540
here's the baking soda,
here's The flower,

3176
02:29:46,541 --> 02:29:47,950
here's the eggs here,
the sugar.

3177
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:52,930
Once you Vegan cake,
once you put it all together,

3178
02:29:53,230 --> 02:29:55,780
right?
You're unable to then point,

3179
02:29:55,781 --> 02:29:57,760
once the cake is made,
you can't point,

3180
02:29:57,790 --> 02:29:59,480
show me where the eggs are showing,
right?

3181
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:01,720
It's an x,
it's an extra fuel mix.

3182
02:30:01,960 --> 02:30:03,760
That's the idea of nature versus 
nurture.

3183
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:06,970
Makes no sense.
We're this big challenge with this cake.

3184
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:08,130
Of course.
Yeah.

3185
02:30:08,220 --> 02:30:08,710
Uh,
so,

3186
02:30:08,730 --> 02:30:13,730
so I think it comes from the idea that 
it's biology is scary because it's 

3187
02:30:14,191 --> 02:30:17,350
somehow doesn't carry with a degrees of 
freedom.

3188
02:30:17,610 --> 02:30:22,610
You know,
if boys are supposed to be this and 

3189
02:30:22,610 --> 02:30:24,811
girls are supposed to be that,
then we're doomed to those biological 

3190
02:30:24,811 --> 02:30:24,811
imperatives.

3191
02:30:24,811 --> 02:30:25,930
And again,
that's not true.

3192
02:30:26,290 --> 02:30:29,710
All of these phenomena fall on a bell 
curve,

3193
02:30:29,711 --> 02:30:30,100
right?
I mean,

3194
02:30:30,340 --> 02:30:33,460
some people are more this way.
Some people are more that way,

3195
02:30:33,461 --> 02:30:36,210
so there's nothing really deterministic.
Also,

3196
02:30:36,580 --> 02:30:38,770
just another point,
for example,

3197
02:30:38,860 --> 02:30:41,210
men have a,
uh,

3198
02:30:41,320 --> 02:30:45,220
evolved desire to seek status.
That's the biological imperative because

3199
02:30:45,221 --> 02:30:50,221
women desire status and men,
but now the way Joe and Gad go about 

3200
02:30:50,530 --> 02:30:53,590
instantiating that evolutionary 
imperative,

3201
02:30:53,830 --> 02:30:58,830
it's completely different as a function 
of their idiosyncratic talents that 

3202
02:30:58,830 --> 02:31:00,950
shows you that it's not right.
It's not that we,

3203
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:05,680
we both have to become comics and that's
the only way to gain status.

3204
02:31:05,740 --> 02:31:10,740
What is common to both of us is we both 
aspire to ascend the social hierarchy.

3205
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:16,200
That's the common biological imperative.
How we go about it is completely 

3206
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:17,350
determined based on your unique 
personhood.

3207
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:19,770
So again,
there's nothing deterministic about it.

3208
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:25,550
What do you think it is about the 
current climate where people want to 

3209
02:31:25,741 --> 02:31:30,741
ignore all these biological markers like
you were talking about with children and

3210
02:31:31,081 --> 02:31:35,500
gravitating towards certain toys and 
testosterone versus estrogen and babies.

3211
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:40,940
What do you think it is about people 
that want to avoid these things but 

3212
02:31:40,940 --> 02:31:41,610
ignore this data?
Well,

3213
02:31:41,730 --> 02:31:45,000
it's exactly that.
It's the fact that it's very,

3214
02:31:45,001 --> 02:31:47,120
very hopeful.
Oh,

3215
02:31:47,130 --> 02:31:52,130
the narrative is very hopeful to assume 
that we all start with equal 

3216
02:31:52,130 --> 02:31:55,560
potentiality with APP that makes us 
completely indistinguishable.

3217
02:31:55,920 --> 02:32:00,920
That's a very hopeful message because it
basically says that we are infinitely 

3218
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:00,920
malleable.
Right.

3219
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:02,700
You know,
had joe had a different upbringing,

3220
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:04,950
maybe he would have been Michael Jordan.
No,

3221
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:05,970
you wouldn't have been.
Right.

3222
02:32:06,210 --> 02:32:11,210
They are enabling a black guy.
I was just saying about how good a 

3223
02:32:11,210 --> 02:32:13,350
basketball thing could be right there.
They are unique,

3224
02:32:13,650 --> 02:32:18,650
unique realities about the random 
combination of genes that made lionelle 

3225
02:32:18,650 --> 02:32:23,601
messy that makes it such that not 
withstanding the fact that he trains a 

3226
02:32:23,601 --> 02:32:25,200
lot,
much harder than most other people.

3227
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:30,590
He is endowed with unique talents that 
not every other kid would have been 

3228
02:32:30,590 --> 02:32:34,290
privy to those talents.
I always bring that point up when I talk

3229
02:32:34,291 --> 02:32:36,270
about Jon Jones hose that.
John,

3230
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:38,490
how dare you.
Oh sorry.

3231
02:32:38,850 --> 02:32:41,790
Former UFC light heavyweight champion.
It was one of the most talented fighters

3232
02:32:41,791 --> 02:32:44,430
that's ever lived.
A really tall,

3233
02:32:44,460 --> 02:32:48,780
long reach,
spectacular athletic ability and one the

3234
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:50,850
year he was the youngest ever UFC 
champion.

3235
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:53,310
Right.
And just dominate which era.

3236
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:57,750
This era he beat Mauricio Shogun,
who,

3237
02:32:57,751 --> 02:33:02,751
uh,
for the title and just destroyed him in 

3238
02:33:02,751 --> 02:33:04,740
his first title fight in the shoguns 
like famous world class.

3239
02:33:04,741 --> 02:33:07,230
MMA fighters fought the best of the best
throughout history.

3240
02:33:07,530 --> 02:33:10,290
And what he,
I always say,

3241
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:12,030
no matter how hard you train,
you could.

3242
02:33:12,060 --> 02:33:14,550
If you're just a regular dude,
you're never going to be that guy.

3243
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:17,340
If he trains just as hard,
you're fucked.

3244
02:33:17,430 --> 02:33:19,320
Right.
He's just very talented.

3245
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:21,410
Very physically talented.
Yeah.

3246
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:22,760
There you go.
Yeah.

3247
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:26,310
There's where not created equal.
We're just not just not.

3248
02:33:26,390 --> 02:33:27,690
I mean Einstein.
Ron,

3249
02:33:27,700 --> 02:33:29,460
Jeremy's Dick.
I haven't.

3250
02:33:29,730 --> 02:33:30,620
I have.
You have.

3251
02:33:30,621 --> 02:33:32,010
I have not,
not in person,

3252
02:33:32,011 --> 02:33:33,150
but I've seen it in.
There you go.

3253
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:36,060
As a 13 or 14 year old trying to sneak 
into good Lord.

3254
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:37,460
That is impressive.
Yes.

3255
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:41,190
Can I also mentioned that he's Jewish?
Just just to let you go look at that.

3256
02:33:41,610 --> 02:33:42,570
By the way,
that the Klan,

3257
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:43,800
by the way,
by the way,

3258
02:33:43,801 --> 02:33:48,801
if you look at,
there's this a world atlas of being 

3259
02:33:48,801 --> 02:33:52,790
sizes that came out and I wish to engage
in modesty,

3260
02:33:53,551 --> 02:33:57,480
but you might want to check the scores 
of the Lebanese men just for giant.

3261
02:33:57,520 --> 02:33:59,640
Just saying.
I'm just saying congratulations.

3262
02:34:00,090 --> 02:34:02,670
Congratulations on your people.
Second place to black folks though,

3263
02:34:02,671 --> 02:34:04,530
right there,
there were up there.

3264
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:10,640
They were out there.
Know everyone starts out dates.

3265
02:34:10,650 --> 02:34:13,500
Just patriarchy that women have bigger 
dicks than men.

3266
02:34:13,540 --> 02:34:14,820
Right?
Right.

3267
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:17,680
It's the patriarchy that makes their 
clitoris is smaller penises.

3268
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:23,040
Do you find.
Do you think that there's going to 

3269
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:24,601
become a time in our lifetimes at all 
ever wear this climate is going to 

3270
02:34:25,001 --> 02:34:30,001
adjust back?
Is it going to take 100 years for just 

3271
02:34:30,001 --> 02:34:30,260
back to some sort of.
I find that question so,

3272
02:34:30,310 --> 02:34:35,310
so fascinating because I.
it's hard for me to predict what the 

3273
02:34:35,310 --> 02:34:37,420
trajectory would be on the one hand and 
on my pessimistic day.

3274
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:39,370
I think that,
you know,

3275
02:34:39,390 --> 02:34:41,920
all,
all great empires imploded from within.

3276
02:34:41,950 --> 02:34:42,790
You've heard that,
right?

3277
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:46,330
It's not that there's sort of this 
hordes of other folks that come in,

3278
02:34:46,390 --> 02:34:51,390
it's it's,
it's the empire that becomes cancerous 

3279
02:34:51,390 --> 02:34:53,230
within itself and it implodes.
I think on my pessimistic days,

3280
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:53,920
I say,
no,

3281
02:34:53,921 --> 02:34:54,610
we're screwed.

3282
02:34:54,970 --> 02:34:59,970
This is just going to go on further and 
further until the whole west collapses 

3283
02:34:59,970 --> 02:35:02,140
in this grand lunacy that we're engaged 
in,

3284
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:05,980
but it's not the whole west.
It's not everyone.

3285
02:35:05,981 --> 02:35:10,981
There's a lot of people out there that,
that aren't represented by this 

3286
02:35:10,981 --> 02:35:14,041
ideology,
but not the intelligentsia who 

3287
02:35:14,041 --> 02:35:14,041
controlled the information.
Right.

3288
02:35:14,041 --> 02:35:15,220
They don't really control information 
anymore is my point.

3289
02:35:15,221 --> 02:35:20,221
The Internet Internet information.
That's true and it's not even the 

3290
02:35:20,221 --> 02:35:21,310
intelligentsia that's doing this.
It's children.

3291
02:35:21,700 --> 02:35:24,570
It's students that are scaring the fuck 
out of teacher.

3292
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:25,720
Right?
I mean,

3293
02:35:25,721 --> 02:35:28,780
that's really what it is.
It's like Tumbler and facebook and these

3294
02:35:29,250 --> 02:35:34,250
people that formed these insulated 
groups where there their echo chambers 

3295
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:34,690
and they,
you know,

3296
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:37,150
they believe that this is reality and 
they,

3297
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:39,130
they,
they want to yell at it.

3298
02:35:39,131 --> 02:35:40,990
Bernie Sanders,
black lives matter,

3299
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:43,930
and then they get the fucking mic,
which is even crazier.

3300
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:46,360
They let those kids who screamed and 
yelled,

3301
02:35:46,361 --> 02:35:48,040
they let them talk and incredible.

3302
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:50,970
Just like that's the worst fucking 
message to send.

3303
02:35:50,980 --> 02:35:53,140
By the way.
We will let you have the mic.

3304
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:55,870
We will let you have to stop screaming 
at him.

3305
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:58,570
So what's.
Why are you more optimistic?

3306
02:35:58,571 --> 02:36:00,010
Do you think that will be?
Yes,

3307
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:02,110
yes.
I think that how would it work?

3308
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:05,050
Because kids today are growing up,
listening to conversations like this and

3309
02:36:05,051 --> 02:36:08,500
realizing how retarded these 20 year 
olds are and that they're going,

3310
02:36:08,501 --> 02:36:13,501
I want to be that when I get older I 
want to look at things for what they 

3311
02:36:13,501 --> 02:36:13,501
really are and I think that as they get 
to that position,

3312
02:36:13,501 --> 02:36:18,301
this,
this new crop will have grown up and 

3313
02:36:18,301 --> 02:36:20,851
come out of this dark hole that is the 
clan that grew up with social media.

3314
02:36:22,630 --> 02:36:27,630
They grew up in these,
these groups with massive confirmation 

3315
02:36:27,630 --> 02:36:27,630
bias.
Right?

3316
02:36:27,630 --> 02:36:32,430
And this confirmation bias I think is 
kind of in these certain ways is kind of

3317
02:36:33,251 --> 02:36:33,820
dangerous.

3318
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:39,190
You know,
I mean not to blow smoke up your 

3319
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:42,391
proverbial behind on your birthday,
but one of the wonderful things in the 

3320
02:36:42,391 --> 02:36:46,980
last year has been to appear on your 
show precisely because I've seen the 

3321
02:36:46,980 --> 02:36:49,960
reach that you have just in terms of how
people have responded to my work.

3322
02:36:49,961 --> 02:36:54,961
Right.
I mean most scientists will toil in 

3323
02:36:54,961 --> 02:36:55,270
their respective disciplines.
I mean hopefully they do good stuff,

3324
02:36:55,570 --> 02:37:00,570
but the number of people that they 
ultimately are communicating with as if 

3325
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:00,610
it was a very restrained small number.
Right.

3326
02:37:00,910 --> 02:37:05,910
But by coming on these types of shows,
that's why I think we were talking 

3327
02:37:05,910 --> 02:37:05,910
earlier about,
you know,

3328
02:37:05,910 --> 02:37:07,630
coming out of your shell,
engaging in the public discourse,

3329
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:12,840
weighing in on these issues.
I always a debate some of my colleagues,

3330
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:16,520
many of whom are very much in the ivory 
tower,

3331
02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:21,640
right.
We only communicate with other members 

3332
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:21,640
of the clergy,
right.

3333
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:25,370
With other members of our restricted the
class of high brow.

3334
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:28,260
And I think that that's not really what 
the job of a professor is.

3335
02:37:28,280 --> 02:37:30,350
I mean,
that's part of the job we have to create

3336
02:37:30,351 --> 02:37:32,810
knowledge and communicated to other 
academics,

3337
02:37:33,140 --> 02:37:36,380
but if we're good academics,
if we're good men have ideas,

3338
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:38,710
we also have to be engaging the public.
Right?

3339
02:37:38,711 --> 02:37:42,370
I mean ultimately the public also pays 
for my salary through also.

3340
02:37:42,770 --> 02:37:44,900
That's how information really gets 
spreaded.

3341
02:37:44,910 --> 02:37:47,420
It doesn't get spread by bouncing it 
around amongst each other,

3342
02:37:47,421 --> 02:37:50,300
like a little beach ball at a concert.
Exactly.

3343
02:37:50,301 --> 02:37:54,410
Gets spread by getting it out there into
the great channel of the Internet.

3344
02:37:54,470 --> 02:37:59,470
Exactly,
so the number of people that have heard 

3345
02:37:59,470 --> 02:38:02,291
of my evolutionary psychology work as 
applied to consumer behavior and so on 

3346
02:38:02,291 --> 02:38:06,490
through just having been on your show is
it will probably take me 10 careers 

3347
02:38:06,490 --> 02:38:11,140
before I could reach as many people 
through some other forum and so I agree 

3348
02:38:11,140 --> 02:38:14,270
with you in that sense that these types 
of forums are profoundly important.

3349
02:38:14,270 --> 02:38:19,270
I only wish that more academics would 
actually have the courage to start 

3350
02:38:19,270 --> 02:38:22,040
coming on these types as well.
It's very dangerous for them financially

3351
02:38:22,041 --> 02:38:24,920
independent and these and these 
environments that we have today.

3352
02:38:24,921 --> 02:38:29,921
I mean,
you could cherry pick a million things 

3353
02:38:29,921 --> 02:38:31,931
that are said in this show and take them
out of context and paint me out to be 

3354
02:38:31,931 --> 02:38:31,931
some sort of a monster.
True.

3355
02:38:31,931 --> 02:38:36,780
That's just the nature of having a 
conversation with someone where you 

3356
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:40,661
joking around.
Whereas if you take it and put it in 

3357
02:38:40,661 --> 02:38:44,261
quotes in print and you take something 
out of the context of the conversation 

3358
02:38:46,131 --> 02:38:51,131
and put it in print and you could have.
You can infer all sorts of different 

3359
02:38:51,131 --> 02:38:52,670
ways that this person is trying to 
communicate.

3360
02:38:52,970 --> 02:38:55,910
That could be construed as being 
offensive and then it gets.

3361
02:38:56,240 --> 02:38:59,390
It gets gross.
The difference between back then and now

3362
02:38:59,450 --> 02:39:02,480
is now you could always just go on a 
podcast and talk about.

3363
02:39:02,750 --> 02:39:07,750
You could always write a facebook blog 
and explain yourself in great detail 

3364
02:39:07,750 --> 02:39:12,131
with no editorial input whatsoever.
No one can come along and take away from

3365
02:39:12,261 --> 02:39:13,060
it.
Or you know,

3366
02:39:13,070 --> 02:39:18,070
I've talked to many people that have 
written things and then had those 

3367
02:39:18,070 --> 02:39:21,251
things.
Even publishing online magazines has 

3368
02:39:21,251 --> 02:39:23,921
those things heavily edited and chopped 
up and even had words put in their 

3369
02:39:23,921 --> 02:39:24,920
mouth.
I had a dispute with this journalist and

3370
02:39:24,921 --> 02:39:25,970
we were talking about something and,
well,

3371
02:39:25,971 --> 02:39:28,340
why did you save that?
And she goes,

3372
02:39:28,341 --> 02:39:29,480
I didn't say that.
Wow,

3373
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:31,400
the editor put that in there.
I go,

3374
02:39:31,430 --> 02:39:33,530
you're kidding me.
They can do that.

3375
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:34,520
And she goes,
yeah,

3376
02:39:34,521 --> 02:39:36,980
they add things to it.
I know that's fucking insane.

3377
02:39:37,010 --> 02:39:40,040
I've experienced something similar to 
that on several occasions.

3378
02:39:40,041 --> 02:39:42,800
So one time a guy called me when my book
came out,

3379
02:39:43,100 --> 02:39:46,520
the book has pornography and it's titled
the consuming instinct and it's subtitle

3380
02:39:46,820 --> 02:39:47,900
and he really.
I mean,

3381
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:52,990
the key point he wanted to get to was 
that professor sad argues that there is 

3382
02:39:53,511 --> 02:39:58,511
a gene for porn,
which of course I'm not at all arguing 

3383
02:39:58,511 --> 02:40:02,261
that.
So I kept repeatedly explaining to him 

3384
02:40:02,261 --> 02:40:05,740
that to explain the evolutionary basis 
of why men might enjoy porn doesn't 

3385
02:40:06,171 --> 02:40:09,430
suggest that there's a set of genes in 
your genome that you know,

3386
02:40:09,460 --> 02:40:13,080
that cold for porn preferences.
I explained.

3387
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:14,100
So please don't.

3388
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:17,910
Next day you know exactly what he wanted
to course.

3389
02:40:18,340 --> 02:40:19,830
Uh,
but you just learn to.

3390
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:21,510
That's part of the beast.
They don't care.

3391
02:40:21,511 --> 02:40:23,340
They're not trying to be honest.
Yeah.

3392
02:40:23,430 --> 02:40:28,430
It's not intellectual honesty.
What it is is they're trying to get 

3393
02:40:28,430 --> 02:40:31,400
clicks to trying to get people to pay 
attention to it and that's what they do 

3394
02:40:31,400 --> 02:40:33,720
and they can do it for now,
but this is a transitionary time between

3395
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:37,560
this time that we're at now where there 
is still this a bit of cloudiness,

3396
02:40:37,590 --> 02:40:42,590
right?
There's a bit of fog in the air of 

3397
02:40:42,590 --> 02:40:42,590
information,
you know,

3398
02:40:42,590 --> 02:40:44,070
it's just sometimes it's hard to find 
out exactly what the fuck is going on,

3399
02:40:44,071 --> 02:40:49,071
but that fog is very,
very close to being lifted and sheer 

3400
02:40:49,071 --> 02:40:52,701
intent I think will be displayed.
It will be a part of discourse in a way 

3401
02:40:52,891 --> 02:40:55,830
that I don't think has existed before in
the near future.

3402
02:40:56,030 --> 02:41:01,030
Right.
I think you're going to be able to know 

3403
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:01,860
a lot more about what someone's trying 
to portray just in the next decade or so

3404
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:06,920
than we've ever known in the past.
And also the transparency like that you 

3405
02:41:06,961 --> 02:41:11,961
have like the transparency that not just
in your words and how you,

3406
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:15,570
uh,
you are able to communicate and describe

3407
02:41:15,571 --> 02:41:20,571
things,
but also in how you're able to defend 

3408
02:41:20,571 --> 02:41:23,241
those things.
If something comes up that just didn't 

3409
02:41:23,241 --> 02:41:24,600
exist before,
he had no recourse if somebody misquoted

3410
02:41:24,601 --> 02:41:29,601
you or an eye.
I've had that happen before a long time 

3411
02:41:29,601 --> 02:41:32,841
ago and like 99,
this woman wrote an article about my 

3412
02:41:32,841 --> 02:41:36,171
show or one of my cds.
She did a review of my cd and not just 

3413
02:41:36,511 --> 02:41:41,511
took me out of context,
but completely misquoted me and changed 

3414
02:41:41,581 --> 02:41:46,320
the words of my bits to make them 
horrible and I had a conversation on the

3415
02:41:46,321 --> 02:41:47,550
phone with her,
with my publicist.

3416
02:41:47,550 --> 02:41:48,810
I'm like,
why didn't you do that?

3417
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:49,620
And she's like,
well,

3418
02:41:49,621 --> 02:41:51,500
that's what I heard when I heard your 
work.

3419
02:41:51,530 --> 02:41:53,070
I go,
that's what you heard.

3420
02:41:53,130 --> 02:41:54,430
That's what you heard.
I go,

3421
02:41:54,431 --> 02:41:56,130
well,
that's not what I wrote,

3422
02:41:56,250 --> 02:41:58,350
but that's not what I said.
It's not what I wrote.

3423
02:41:58,490 --> 02:42:00,150
And so you lied.
I go,

3424
02:42:00,151 --> 02:42:01,720
you're a fucking liar.
Like,

3425
02:42:01,721 --> 02:42:02,640
well,
you're not a journalist,

3426
02:42:02,641 --> 02:42:06,180
you're a liar.
And she thought I left the phone.

3427
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:09,000
She started.
I left and hung up because I just,

3428
02:42:09,001 --> 02:42:09,540
I go,
well,

3429
02:42:09,541 --> 02:42:10,980
we're done talking then.
Great.

3430
02:42:11,370 --> 02:42:13,740
And so she goes,
she.

3431
02:42:13,741 --> 02:42:15,810
There was a pause and so she says,
the publishers,

3432
02:42:16,020 --> 02:42:17,850
your,
your client is losing it.

3433
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,530
And I go,
I'm not losing it.

3434
02:42:19,531 --> 02:42:24,531
You're a fucking liar.
Do you not understand what happened 

3435
02:42:24,531 --> 02:42:27,141
here?
So I wrote a story about her in my blog 

3436
02:42:27,141 --> 02:42:27,860
about,
um,

3437
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:31,410
just I called yellow journalism.
I think it was the title of it,

3438
02:42:31,411 --> 02:42:33,300
about how ridiculous she was.

3439
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:35,580
And it was the first time that anybody 
could ever do something like that.

3440
02:42:35,610 --> 02:42:37,530
Right?
In the old days you would have to get it

3441
02:42:37,531 --> 02:42:38,430
printed somewhere,
you know,

3442
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:40,980
to get it printed in a magazine.
Good luck writing,

3443
02:42:41,020 --> 02:42:43,810
uh,
an article about how um,

3444
02:42:43,860 --> 02:42:48,860
you know,
you wanted to love someone because they 

3445
02:42:48,860 --> 02:42:50,070
were so full of shit.
I forget what I said.

3446
02:42:50,071 --> 02:42:51,840
I was just trying to be ridiculous.
I was trying to upset her,

3447
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:52,470
right.
You know,

3448
02:42:52,530 --> 02:42:56,370
but that used to be what they could do,
you know,

3449
02:42:56,371 --> 02:43:01,371
that some guy could listen to you talk 
about genes and pornography and how men 

3450
02:43:01,651 --> 02:43:03,750
could be more attracted to pornography 
and go,

3451
02:43:03,751 --> 02:43:08,751
oh,
I know how to make this fucking 

3452
02:43:08,751 --> 02:43:08,751
salacious.
I know how to make that guy look like an

3453
02:43:08,751 --> 02:43:08,850
asshole.
I'm just going to say,

3454
02:43:08,851 --> 02:43:13,851
this professor thinks there's a gene for
they're prints and done.

3455
02:43:15,370 --> 02:43:16,060
What can he do?

3456
02:43:16,330 --> 02:43:16,840
Well,
what can he do?

3457
02:43:16,841 --> 02:43:18,010
What's his name?
What's that guy's name?

3458
02:43:18,510 --> 02:43:19,270
Oh,
I don't remember.

3459
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:21,790
And will fight for.
I could probably find that out.

3460
02:43:23,050 --> 02:43:24,310
We know what you did.
That's right.

3461
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:25,080
You know,
you did too.

3462
02:43:25,081 --> 02:43:26,380
You can't,
you know.

3463
02:43:27,010 --> 02:43:29,680
But I mean you've had a platform because
of,

3464
02:43:29,720 --> 02:43:30,910
you know,
being an entertainment.

3465
02:43:31,210 --> 02:43:36,210
But I'm,
I'm amazed by guys who start youtube 

3466
02:43:36,210 --> 02:43:36,210
channels.
I recently appeared on a,

3467
02:43:36,210 --> 02:43:39,070
on a youtube channel that Scott,
he calls himself Sargon of awkward.

3468
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:40,600
He,
I mean he's,

3469
02:43:40,660 --> 02:43:42,940
he's a nobody in the sense of not having
come from,

3470
02:43:42,941 --> 02:43:47,941
you know,
an acting world or not being a public 

3471
02:43:47,941 --> 02:43:47,941
figure,
but this guy is brilliant.

3472
02:43:47,941 --> 02:43:50,170
He now has over 150,000
youtube subscribers,

3473
02:43:50,500 --> 02:43:53,170
maybe 25,
$30 million viewers.

3474
02:43:53,230 --> 02:43:54,000
Beautiful.
Right?

3475
02:43:54,070 --> 02:43:56,770
And that's based on merit and start,
right?

3476
02:43:56,950 --> 02:44:00,120
This guy would never have had a voice.
What were it?

3477
02:44:00,130 --> 02:44:01,340
Not for the,
the,

3478
02:44:01,460 --> 02:44:04,240
the mediums that we are now afforded to 
us.

3479
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:09,630
And so that's why I just,
I feel like a kid in a candy store to 

3480
02:44:09,630 --> 02:44:11,740
appear on all these shows because it 
offers me a voice to spread means,

3481
02:44:11,741 --> 02:44:16,741
right.
I mean I consider my job as a meme 

3482
02:44:16,741 --> 02:44:18,250
creator mean propagator.
And so any way that I can do that,

3483
02:44:18,340 --> 02:44:19,540
including coming on,
you know,

3484
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:22,870
this brilliant podcast,
I consider myself unbelievably fortunate

3485
02:44:22,871 --> 02:44:25,780
and I don't see why other academics 
don't see the value in death.

3486
02:44:25,900 --> 02:44:27,850
Well I think they will eventually in 
some do.

3487
02:44:27,851 --> 02:44:29,860
I mean I have,
I've had quite a few on now,

3488
02:44:29,861 --> 02:44:34,861
but I think that what we're dealing with
is a new thing we're dealing with is 

3489
02:44:34,861 --> 02:44:38,101
this completely new pathway to for 
information to travel and it has to be 

3490
02:44:38,651 --> 02:44:41,290
kind of recognized and accept and it's 
slowly being done.

3491
02:44:41,291 --> 02:44:44,650
So like there's a sign in front of the 
comedy store and one of the hotels,

3492
02:44:44,651 --> 02:44:44,900
like,
you know,

3493
02:44:44,960 --> 02:44:49,960
they paint the side,
like a billboard on the entire side of 

3494
02:44:49,960 --> 02:44:51,550
the hotel and it's a youtube channel 
that has millions of subscribers.

3495
02:44:51,730 --> 02:44:54,070
So this woman's Youtube Channel,
I've never heard of her before,

3496
02:44:54,071 --> 02:44:59,071
but she's got millions of subscribers 
and there's a few of those that youtube 

3497
02:44:59,071 --> 02:45:02,731
has put up all around the city and what 
they're getting for each individual 

3498
02:45:02,731 --> 02:45:05,200
video that they put out is very similar 
to what a hit cable show gets.

3499
02:45:05,650 --> 02:45:07,900
And that's reality and you can't fuck 
with that.

3500
02:45:07,901 --> 02:45:12,901
Those are real numbers and real people 
that are the same kind of people that 

3501
02:45:12,901 --> 02:45:14,210
watch television and it's just a new 
pathway for information.

3502
02:45:14,950 --> 02:45:17,590
It just makes it harder for people to 
lie and bullshit.

3503
02:45:17,770 --> 02:45:19,270
And like that guy who wrote that 
article,

3504
02:45:19,271 --> 02:45:24,271
he's just lazy,
he's lazy and just work sucks and his 

3505
02:45:24,271 --> 02:45:26,200
mind's week.
And so he wants to come up with some way

3506
02:45:26,201 --> 02:45:29,320
that he can turn something in,
some click baity bullshit article.

3507
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:34,500
So that's what he does.
He distorts reality to fit his own 

3508
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:34,600
agenda and for his own game.

3509
02:45:34,660 --> 02:45:39,660
And uh,
and he does so in a way that he doesn't 

3510
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:39,790
care for damages you because he has 
power over you.

3511
02:45:39,820 --> 02:45:44,820
Right?
He doesn't have any power over you 

3512
02:45:44,820 --> 02:45:44,820
anymore.
No one does.

3513
02:45:44,820 --> 02:45:47,251
No one has any power of anyone and this 
whatever of mart or wherever the fuck 

3514
02:45:47,251 --> 02:45:49,190
the guy's name was.
I'm sorry I'm putting,

3515
02:45:49,260 --> 02:45:51,010
he's going to get millions of good 
friends,

3516
02:45:51,570 --> 02:45:54,940
but this guy,
he got there based on merit,

3517
02:45:55,000 --> 02:46:00,000
you know,
and there's a lot of those guys out 

3518
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:01,831
there now and they cover a wide variety 
of topics to whether it's sports,

3519
02:46:02,561 --> 02:46:04,900
there's martial arts commentators that 
have done that.

3520
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:09,920
There's,
there's people that do that about 

3521
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:11,060
technology.
It's just we live in a beautiful time to

3522
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:13,610
174,000
followers.

3523
02:46:13,611 --> 02:46:15,890
I mean,
I know it's nothing but that's.

3524
02:46:15,891 --> 02:46:18,320
I mean that's what was on television 
though.

3525
02:46:18,321 --> 02:46:21,730
He's on Fox all the time and he's a 
legit journalist for May,

3526
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:23,080
but yeah,
it's beautiful.

3527
02:46:23,090 --> 02:46:28,090
And.
But he started out on the Internet as 

3528
02:46:28,090 --> 02:46:28,090
well.
We live in a beautiful time.

3529
02:46:28,090 --> 02:46:29,030
We do.
Speaking of time gotta wrap this bitch.

3530
02:46:29,110 --> 02:46:31,250
Oh Nice.
Do we do any promotional stuff?

3531
02:46:31,490 --> 02:46:32,870
Do you want to.
