1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,530
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,520
um,

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,480
is there anything in this episode
or this issue that deals with a very

4
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:10,230
controversial issue of antidepressants
and their effect on the human mind?

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,850
People asking about about that?

6
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:13,510
So,

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:13,960
you know,

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,800
anti psychotics,

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,200
here's one thing that I'll say about
or Ssri or not anti psychotics,

10
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:18,700
sorry,

11
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,530
not Ssri.

12
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,160
I don't have good informed
opinion on antidepressant,

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,881
on antidepressants.

14
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:26,960
I just don't know enough about it.

15
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:27,440
I wouldn't,

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,600
I wouldn't know how to
comment on that intelligently.

17
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,310
I will say that,

18
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,570
you know,

19
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,860
anti psychotics,

20
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,610
which are a sort of,

21
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:34,790
you know,

22
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,391
an extreme thing,

23
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:35,541
right?

24
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:36,374
There's all kinds of,

25
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,430
of uh,

26
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,211
you know,

27
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:40,460
incredible research being done,

28
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,290
but we're still,

29
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,770
it's still very early days
in our understanding of
what drugs do to the brain

30
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:46,940
and what happens here and there.

31
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:47,774
And so,

32
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,620
you know,

33
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,453
anti psychotics,

34
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:49,700
there's,

35
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,030
there was a statistically
significant group of people in a,

36
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:53,810
I think God,

37
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,980
I'm going to miss represent this,

38
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:55,330
but no,

39
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,450
basically I was talking to a university
professor who had done this study about,

40
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,383
um,

41
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,140
she was a clinical psychologist who had
done a study about people taking out our

42
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:04,460
psychotics and a certain number of,

43
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,383
of,

44
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:05,630
uh,

45
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,550
the patients were so transformed by this
new generation of anti psychotics that

46
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:10,970
they did,

47
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,900
that they voluntarily went off them to
go back to the hallucinations that they'd

48
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:15,710
had before.

49
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,190
Wow.

50
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,420
It's not a lot of people.

51
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:18,920
I don't want to necessarily
represent the number,

52
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:21,230
but it was a statistically
significant group of people,

53
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:23,200
which means that there are people who,

54
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,081
for whatever reason,

55
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,610
their reaction is I would rather.

56
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,880
So in one of the cases
that you described was a,

57
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,140
uh,

58
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,691
a man,

59
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:34,691
a homeless man who believed that he
was being pursued by the Russians,

60
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,450
you know,

61
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,450
and was living in stark terror in this
kind of cold war nightmare every waking

62
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:42,080
moment.

63
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,890
And he was homeless and
Dorothy but just ruined guy.

64
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,220
He goes and he gets begins to get this
anti psychotic medication and these,

65
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,590
and it turns off not
just your hallucinations,

66
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:57,650
but it also maintains your
ability to reason and function.

67
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:57,930
You know,

68
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,490
it can be very helpful sometimes if it,

69
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,371
if it works,

70
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,110
and I'd like to point out
that's not always true.

71
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,133
Um,

72
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,380
but he was so destabilized by
discovering that nobody wanted him.

73
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,540
The Russians didn't want him,

74
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,374
nobody wanted them.

75
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,380
Right now he's just a bum dude.

76
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:14,840
And he was,

77
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,940
he was bummed out because,

78
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,740
because he wasn't special anymore.

79
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,100
Right.

80
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,590
He was the star of his own
action movie for so long,

81
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,453
you know,

82
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,060
and add more guy and he and
he voluntarily went back to,

83
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,080
to being,

84
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,520
to living that life,

85
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,920
you know,

86
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,060
he took the blue pill and then whatever
it was and then wished you hadn't.

87
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:31,660
Well,

88
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,680
I would like to see what he saw before
I made any sort of a judgment on them

89
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:36,401
because who knows,

90
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:39,140
he might have been living in an awesome
world like a winnie the Pooh ride.

91
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,730
Totally neon colors everywhere and
fucking Russian agents hiding behind two

92
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:45,780
dimensional trees.

93
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,620
Marriage driving a convertible.

94
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,280
Yeah,

95
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,521
I mean,

96
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:50,520
who knows what he actually saw a,

97
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,770
there was this conversation on,

98
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,030
on the board recently where
I brought up the thing about,

99
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,860
uh,

100
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,790
if you had a thousand
monkeys on typewriters,

101
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,020
eventually they would write the works of,

102
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,660
given an infinite number
of time or amount of time.

103
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,770
I think that's horseshit.

104
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,740
But it is true because an
infinite number of time.

105
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,760
Yeah,

106
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,520
because if you had like,

107
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,190
let's just take out the monkeys and
say you have one computer program,

108
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,040
did you imagine that a monkey really did?

109
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,820
Right.

110
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,320
Like Romeo and Juliet,

111
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,920
you just left this monkey in a fucking
room at a typewriter and most of it was

112
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,963
dog shit.

113
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,420
Most of them will say,

114
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,060
why?

115
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,720
Why?

116
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,160
But one day that monkey just got it right
and his little fucking eyes rolled in

117
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,730
the back of his head like a slot machine.

118
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,593
He starts typing.

119
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,310
I didn't even notice it.

120
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,610
It just can't even right at the end of
midsummer night's dream Romeo but not.

121
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,240
I mean,

122
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,791
the question is,

123
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,360
you know,

124
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,030
like say you,

125
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,180
you're randomly selecting characters.

126
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,860
Each character is randomly selected and
you do this for an infinite string of

127
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,694
characters.

128
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,500
Then not only would you get the
entire works of Shakespeare,

129
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,600
but you would get an
infinite number of times.

130
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,420
You would get it backwards and infinite
number of times you would get every

131
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,350
chapter in every order,

132
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:03,160
an infinite number of times you would get
everything that's ever been written in

133
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,060
every single order that you could ever
think to put it in an infinite number of

134
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,440
times by my sweat.

135
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,360
Infinite that monkeys.

136
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:11,690
Well,

137
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,570
why would he is on a
typewriter with chimps?

138
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,160
Yeah,

139
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,110
there they wouldn't
hurt the little fingers.

140
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,990
Monkeys.

141
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,823
They're little tiny.

142
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,051
Yeah,

143
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,630
man.

144
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,410
That's the word in it.

145
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,390
Yeah.

146
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,570
Even that doesn't even begin
to describe it in that,

147
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,040
that that word is a real
problem where we don't really.

148
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,420
That doesn't register with me
when I say infinite on my face.

149
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,780
It's goes until I can think
about it and then it keeps going.

150
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,980
I mean even just like when you see
those videos of like they sent a probe,

151
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,070
like an artificial prob like to show
you what it looks like when they leave

152
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:47,110
earth and then it sees the moon,

153
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,570
then it sees the other outer
planets and then it sees,

154
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,081
you know,

155
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,211
the,

156
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:52,630
the galaxy from a distance
and it keeps going and going.

157
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,070
That doesn't work.

158
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,380
It doesn't get in there.

159
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,190
It doesn't get in there.

160
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,500
I mean there are so fucking far away
when you have to start thinking about the

161
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,334
speed of light.

162
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,700
Like the fact that the son
is eight light minutes away.

163
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,100
Mars is like 30 light minutes away.

164
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:10,510
Pluto is like 18 hours
away in terms of lights.

165
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,490
Will Dr. Greer is going to let us know,

166
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,350
goodness,

167
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,670
how big the universe is when he reveals
what the aliens have been telling him.

168
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,210
Garth brooks is slowly
becoming some classics.

169
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,200
So like,

170
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:23,490
you know,

171
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,670
you have classic rock.

172
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,860
I got friends in low places.

173
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,440
Could be a classes that you saw.

174
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,200
It's weird you say that because I was
at the capital records building a while

175
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,390
ago just to get a friend to work
there and they had this place,

176
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,960
these plaques on the wall and like
every album that sold 10 million copies,

177
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:38,440
right.

178
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,340
Which is not that many.

179
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,080
So you go to the capitol records,

180
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,270
there were like four Beatles records,

181
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,200
dark side of the moon and
just a wall of Garth Brooks,

182
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,480
like you don't realize how many fucking
albums and he had like six albums that

183
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:53,190
sold 10.

184
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,530
Like you wonder why you don't hear from
anymore because he's got more fucking

185
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,730
money than indie music doing vegas now.

186
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,920
I think he started doing
the concerts in Vegas,

187
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,340
but just with an acoustic guitar I
think really like it's just him with a

188
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:04,731
guitar.

189
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,150
Yeah.

190
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,570
Listen,

191
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,710
he's a weird fuck,

192
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,480
but he's undeniably talented.

193
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,680
You can't sell that many records
and not have something going on.

194
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:14,990
I've got friends in low places
is a great fucking song.

195
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,590
If you got a buzz on and that song
comes on and you don't get happy your

196
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,220
account.

197
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,341
Well,

198
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,174
if you're that,

199
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,290
that's a little harsh,

200
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:21,940
but I.

201
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,580
I agree,

202
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,391
but now where I'm from,

203
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:23,780
if you're,

204
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,150
if you're drinking and somebody
doesn't put that on the Jukebox,

205
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,483
like something's wrong,

206
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,240
I cannot take that,

207
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,074
so

208
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,140
of course he can't.

209
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,781
You're from Ohio.

210
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:33,750
You probably heard it every day.

211
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,663
Your life,

212
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,320
your alarm clock,

213
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,183
every day.

214
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,930
You remember when he did that weird thing
garth brooks did where he put on a wig

215
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,400
and pretend to be a different dude.

216
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,000
He was Chris.

217
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,160
Chris Gaines was that.

218
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:46,790
It was God.

219
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,080
That was the weirdest thing ever.

220
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,220
Fuck was that about when I see those
plaques on the wall at capital records,

221
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:52,551
I'm like,

222
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:53,540
no wonder he did that.

223
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,433
He was just like,

224
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,330
come on man.

225
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,523
Who Let.

226
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,300
Who let you do that?

227
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,134
Garth Brooks,

228
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,730
and he grew a little flavor.

229
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:04,220
Savor a little flavor
saver onto the lower lip.

230
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,850
Anyway,

231
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,350
total emo,

232
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,200
Weirdo brooding.

233
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,210
That looks like he was in
an argument with his label.

234
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:11,481
He's like,

235
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:11,751
look,

236
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:12,261
you fuckers,

237
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:13,550
I could sell albums doing anything.

238
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:13,881
I'll fuck.

239
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,530
I want to change my name.

240
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,310
Put a goat,

241
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,480
and then that's what he thought.

242
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,160
He really did believe that.

243
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:19,970
I think that was.

244
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,020
Was that his last album?

245
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:23,481
Boy,

246
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:24,710
that's a shitty way to go out.

247
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,410
If that's his last.

248
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,640
That was like the pictures
of them all with the hair.

249
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:30,560
Just perfectly fine.

250
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:32,570
If we don't know it's a fucking wig man.

251
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
You can't just wear a wig.

252
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,030
Okay.

253
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:35,930
That's ridiculous.

254
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,540
That looks member for a while and snl.

255
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,970
That was like the Goto joke was on weekend
update with every joke because like

256
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,930
Chris gave gaines fucking silly.

257
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:50,931
He is the idea that he thought that he
could pretend to be someone different,

258
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,710
a different personality.

259
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,490
I'm not the happy country guy anymore
even though it's the same guy inside my

260
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:57,870
heart when I'm Chris Gaines.

261
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:58,830
I'm moody as fuck.

262
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,341
Okay.

263
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm all dressed in black and
we'll flavor say even died.

264
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,660
That and my hair.

265
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,480
It's all thick and heavy even
though you know I'm going bald.

266
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,160
Don't think about that.

267
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,570
Don't think about the wig,

268
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,230
man.

269
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,000
Think about the persona.

270
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,770
I'm trying to sell a persona.

271
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:14,730
I got this down.

272
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:15,870
It's Goddamn character.

273
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,940
You've got to love my new CD.

274
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,400
It's Chris Gaines is moody as fuck.

275
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,243
That's what it's called.

276
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,570
I want you to concentrate.

277
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,370
I want you to concentrate
on the shitty music.

278
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,070
This time my shitty looks to me,

279
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,670
but one heart you.

280
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,780
Oh,

281
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,780
do we become when mood together and
like see who wrote these shitty songs,

282
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,030
Chris Gaines or Greg Brooks,

283
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:38,400
but don't know.
