1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,060
So in part there's an
empirical question here,

3
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:06,140
which I don't know the answer to.

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,280
In Europe,

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,520
they ban in most of them
they ban hate speech.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,020
So a or you know,

7
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:12,890
a Holocaust denial.

8
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,120
There's certain things that are illegal.

9
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:14,954
It's a crime.

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,890
Um,

11
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,910
and in America we don't,

12
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,590
now it's an empirical question,

13
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:21,440
meaning it's open to actual investigation.

14
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,250
Um,

15
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,300
does banning it,

16
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:27,500
push it underground and let the people
feel that they are victims of being

17
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:31,850
silencing something come back stronger
or is certainly the best disinfectant.

18
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,540
Um,

19
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,500
I don't know the answer to that.

20
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:33,920
Um,

21
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,850
I think in general,

22
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:37,010
I think the American
system has worked better,

23
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:38,510
but I don't know their scholars who could,

24
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,280
who could address that as for what is
happening to the left is the left more

25
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,143
intolerant.

26
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:44,700
Um,

27
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:44,900
I,

28
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,670
I agree with you that you would think
the left would be more open and in my

29
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:50,331
research on left,

30
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:50,900
right,

31
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,710
the left is generally higher and openness
to experience the idea of dissent.

32
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,180
Dissent is patriotic.

33
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,560
These are leftist ideas,

34
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:57,800
not,

35
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,181
not right.

36
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:58,551
This idea.

37
00:00:58,551 --> 00:00:59,001
So the left,

38
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,500
it should be more open.

39
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,770
Problem is any group that,

40
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,330
any group that loses a
variety that loses diversity,

41
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,890
any group in which everybody
thinks the same is at risk of,

42
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,130
of turning it into an ideology
of turning to her religion.

43
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:16,601
Uh,

44
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,530
and then you lose the
ability to think straight.

45
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,600
And now if somebody,

46
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,380
so you know,

47
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,450
when I was in college at Yale,

48
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:23,900
you know,

49
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,550
everybody sort of leaned left,

50
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,241
but there was,

51
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,051
they were conservatives,

52
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:28,190
there were some conservative professors,

53
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,530
like I'd been exposed to
some conservative ideas.

54
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,270
But now if you're in a college that has
essentially no conservatives that we'll

55
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,670
put out ideas and you encounter one,

56
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:38,600
now it's much more painful.

57
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,620
It's much more shocking.

58
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,161
Again,

59
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:40,994
it's like,

60
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,450
it's like you have a peanut allergy to
ideas that are not your groups and we

61
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:44,751
want,

62
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:45,584
so we,

63
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,370
it's terrible if we're putting
young people in systems
that are basically giving

64
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:51,440
them ideological peanut allergies,

65
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,600
but most fighters are hard headed and
are in a position to be hardheaded.

66
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,790
And that's like the hard part
is like you trying to tell them,

67
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,001
listen,

68
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,380
you need to listen to me right now.

69
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,590
And like,

70
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:00,770
no,

71
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,281
I got this.

72
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,340
And then their careers just,

73
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,390
it's crazy cause that's what made
them a fighter in the first place.

74
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:05,600
Right.

75
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,740
Tell him to fuck off.

76
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,321
That's it.

77
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:11,210
Stepfather beat their ass and they left
the house and there's 16 fucked you.

78
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,680
I'll show the world fucking girl,

79
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:14,030
don't dumb in high school.

80
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,383
And

81
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,870
then next thing I know I'm out there
and then fucking get in the cage.

82
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,700
I feel bad for dudes
who didn't get dumped.

83
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,390
I do.

84
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,930
Why that?

85
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,950
Cause it's good for you.

86
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,131
Yeah.

87
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:26,240
It taught me a lot,

88
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:26,600
man.

89
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,670
I remember my girlfriend in
high school and dumped me.

90
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,070
I was devastated for months.

91
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,360
Just devastated.

92
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,520
But then I realized like what
the Fuck is wrong with me?

93
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,001
And I thought,

94
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:38,480
imagine if I'd married that girl magic.

95
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,400
I've had kids with her and Ooh.

96
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,670
And every day was just
torture her bitching at me
and controlling and oh I got

97
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:47,120
light,

98
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,930
I got off light.

99
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,210
Well here's one for you to enjoy.

100
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,880
Well,

101
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,810
same thing happened to me.

102
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:52,040
I got dumped in high school.

103
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,023
Yeah.

104
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,770
The girl started dating another dude.

105
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,010
I ended up hitting this
motherfucker and hit with a wrench.

106
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,420
Yeah.

107
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,250
And I hit the motherfucking
hair with a wrench.

108
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,370
Why'd you hit him in
the head with a wrench?

109
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,690
He pissed me off.

110
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,200
Oh,

111
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,711
he pissed me.

112
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,030
He made me so mad.

113
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,610
Did he make you mad cause he was banging
the grow or do you make you mad on top

114
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:09,960
of that?

115
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,070
Oh,

116
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,903
on top of that.

117
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,470
Yeah.

118
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,950
So I ended up hitting him and
then I ended up going to jail to,

119
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,360
and I ended up doing 52 weekends in jail.

120
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,350
Damn.

121
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,030
But within that time,

122
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,201
every week,

123
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,790
every weekend I had to go in on Friday,

124
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,420
four year,

125
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,640
come out on Sunday for a year.

126
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,660
So I couldn't leave.

127
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,710
I couldn't leave my city.

128
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,250
So in that time I taught
myself how to fight.

129
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,240
That's why I'm here today.

130
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,253
Wow.

131
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,810
And during the weekends?

132
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,391
No.

133
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:35,820
So,

134
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,220
uh,

135
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,761
during the week,

136
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,391
cause I couldn't leave,

137
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,224
so I would just,

138
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:38,861
I work.

139
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:40,510
And then me and Paul Rodriguez,

140
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,010
he fought 20 to Susan,

141
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,540
Uc 30 to me and him.

142
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,231
We trained them,

143
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,820
we taught ourselves how
to fight in the backyard,

144
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:46,760
watching videotapes.

145
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,520
Wow.

146
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,260
Tony de Souza,

147
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,880
the originator of the Peruvian necktie.

148
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,270
Yep.

149
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,660
Yep.

150
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,560
That's what I came from.

151
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,790
Is that really what I came for us?

152
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,624
He's proven.

153
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,070
No kidding.

154
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,903
That's where it came from.

155
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,810
Yeah.

156
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,460
That Peruvian necktie is a mother fucker.

157
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,150
That's a great move.

158
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,000
That was Tony Shit.

159
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,530
Yeah,

160
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,370
I incorporate that.

161
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:04,510
And on one of my systems,

162
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:04,721
man,

163
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,300
I loved that movie was
a hell of a grappler.

164
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,040
Yeah.

165
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,720
Yeah.

166
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,210
So he ended up choking
out a Paul Rodriguez,

167
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:14,050
UFC 32 and that was in that
I got knocked out by Bj.

168
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,610
Wow.

169
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,100
But it all happened because I got dumped.

170
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,510
Wow.

171
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,250
That's crazy.

172
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,061
Well,

173
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,310
it's just one of those things where you,

174
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,771
when you,

175
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:27,280
when you look back and you think of
all the great things that you did

176
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:27,821
accomplish,

177
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:29,590
then you realize that
you're retired at 30.

178
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,633
Yeah.

179
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,020
So much,

180
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,220
so much room there,

181
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,330
you know,

182
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,590
thirties so young.

183
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,630
You're in your athletic prime.

184
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:37,930
They,

185
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,690
I think they say 32 for
a professional fighter.

186
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,310
They consider most athletic primes.

187
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:42,450
Right.

188
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:42,490
It's that

189
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,323
32.

190
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,911
It was,

191
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:44,570
but you know,

192
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:44,871
uh,

193
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,070
I look back on it and again,

194
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:46,281
you know,

195
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:47,150
the 42 fights,

196
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,140
that's a lot of fights.

197
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,383
Um,

198
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,100
plus I started when I was nine.

199
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,440
I had a little over a hundred
amateur fights during,

200
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:55,310
there was a lot with that.

201
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:55,611
I mean,

202
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,860
for a while there'd be a
while before I retired.

203
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,970
I was throwing it around,

204
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,541
you know,

205
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,374
retiring.

206
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,670
I was one of them guys that just,

207
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,010
I liked it and I loved it,

208
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:06,470
but I also sometimes got tired of it.

209
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm a very simple guy and,

210
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:09,800
and uh,

211
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,633
it don't,

212
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,920
I don't care about the Glam
or to fame or any of that.

213
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:16,850
I truly don't,

214
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,481
you know,

215
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,660
like even now what my,

216
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,060
my podcast and what I'm doing with some
of these other adventures because I got

217
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,260
bored and I'm on to have fun.

218
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,830
Right.

219
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,370
You know what I mean?

220
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,900
And keep myself busy.

221
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,890
And,

222
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,550
um,

223
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,810
I've been fortunate to have what I have
to be able to do all this on my own,

224
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,410
you know,

225
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,930
and go out there and be around everybody.

226
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:36,741
But yeah,

227
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:37,710
so when I was fighting,

228
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:37,920
you know,

229
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,950
there was a lot of rumors
around up to retirement,

230
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:40,191
this,

231
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,024
that,

232
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,290
and I think the final icing on a cake
was we were supposed to fight Andre Ward

233
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,620
and that's when Andre Ward
ended up getting a sh,

234
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,850
a shoulder surgery.

235
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,350
And that flight fell through.

236
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,790
And I had been out in California training
or an Ochsner trainer for almost a

237
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,510
year,

238
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,940
which fighters leave at the
beginning of their career.

239
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,631
You know,

240
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:00,680
when they don't have a family,

241
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,760
when they're not making the money,

242
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,440
that's our opportunity to try and go
and make money that when you're 12 years

243
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:07,160
into it,

244
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,640
you know.

245
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,473
And uh,

246
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,770
so I went out there and that kind of
took a little bit from here as far as the

247
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:13,161
sport,

248
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,400
even though I loved it and it was
great training with Robert Garcia.

249
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,240
I learned so much that didn't think I
could learn at that point in my career.

250
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,090
And when that,

251
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,840
that Andre Ward fight fell through,

252
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,380
um,

253
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,681
I was,

254
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,280
I was done.

255
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,671
I mean,

256
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:26,504
I was,

257
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,591
I rolled over,

258
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,161
I never forget,

259
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:29,210
I rolled over and told my wife,

260
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:29,451
I said,

261
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:30,284
I think I'm done.

262
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,101
And she goes,

263
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:32,030
what are you talking about?

264
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,540
And as,

265
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,540
and I think I'm retiring and she started
crying tears of joy because she wanted

266
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:39,080
me to be done even before that.

267
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,170
She don't know to sport or what,

268
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,830
what prime ages or not.

269
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,783
And uh,

270
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,641
I hung them up and,

271
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:45,231
and you know,

272
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,064
over the years,

273
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,280
as we talked earlier here
who I would get the itch,

274
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,540
you know,

275
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,420
and that could have been just going to
the gym and Aetna are doing around on the

276
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:54,254
pads.

277
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:54,891
But I,

278
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,170
I just didn't ever want
it to keep doing it.

279
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:57,381
You know,

280
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:57,981
my health,

281
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:01,790
believe it or not is more
important than anything else.

282
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,250
Spaces fake.

283
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,521
No,

284
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:03,860
I,

285
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,520
this is different than the flat
earthers little Hashtag spaces,

286
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,500
fake hashtag spaces.

287
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,930
Faith is people that
are so fucking stupid.

288
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,250
The flat earthers kicked him out.

289
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,893
Oh my God.

290
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,270
For real flat earthers
kicked out the space.

291
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,250
Fake people spaces fake is,

292
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,160
oh my God,

293
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,980
they're the most skeptical.

294
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,450
So what would be the upper atmosphere?

295
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:22,961
Would be the edge.

296
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:23,794
It's all bullshit.

297
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,480
It's all fake.

298
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:24,860
It's the end.

299
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,310
It's tied in some weird way to religion,

300
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,220
which is really interesting
because even the flat earth people,

301
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:33,760
there's a tremendous amount of them that
are extremely religious and they talk

302
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:34,610
about the from Amen,

303
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,490
the Bible and the Bible,

304
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,840
and that this is a,

305
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,530
this is what's really going on is that
they're trying to keep us from the

306
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,540
knowledge that God has created.

307
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,280
This place is a very special place.

308
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,850
Right,

309
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,240
and so by pretending that it's round,

310
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,690
they somehow or another
are controlling us.

311
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,860
We're thinking that we're not
exceptional and we're not lucky space.

312
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,590
It's fake.

313
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,000
They're using a video from that Ryan
Gosling's movie he just made about Neil

314
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,001
Armstrong,

315
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:01,990
the first man on the moon.

316
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,380
Yeah.

317
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,130
Just be like this.

318
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,401
Look,

319
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:03,581
look,

320
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:04,414
here's proof.

321
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,620
[inaudible] fake everything.

322
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,270
They're making a movie because of the way
they made the movie is that's evidence

323
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:11,020
that it's fake.

324
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,900
That because he's wearing it.

325
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,460
I don't know if maybe this person doesn't
recognize that as being Ryan Gosling

326
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,323
right there.

327
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,920
She's got an NASA suit on.

328
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,420
Maybe it's just a troll account.

329
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,880
This is how NASA fix everything.

330
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,610
This is the video I
was talking about guys.

331
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,320
Now you know it's all a big act passed.

332
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,330
This is fake.

333
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,650
Click on spaces fake though.

334
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,010
Oh,

335
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,510
that's what,

336
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,061
this is what I'm on.

337
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:31,894
I'm on the whole yeah,

338
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,810
but I mean click on it because there's
a bunch of other warm on that thread.

339
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,160
There's a tremendous amount of people
that literally believe that space is not

340
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:39,760
real.

341
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,950
I think it's like that with
alligators in Florida tail.

342
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,550
Yeah.

343
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,181
When I was a kid,

344
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:43,650
they were,

345
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:43,990
uh,

346
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,100
an endangered species.

347
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,710
They would ask us to please
not feed them marshmallows.

348
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,900
Cause I lived in Gainesville right by
this place called Lake Alice Lake outside

349
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,743
alligators.

350
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,760
Fucking 11 years old.

351
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:55,570
I was living an alligator's.

352
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,040
It was

353
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,870
crazy.

354
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,170
It was a goddamn dinosaur.

355
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,920
But there was a small population of
them cause they had been whacked into

356
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,260
oblivion before and people would
make it suitcases out of him.

357
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,040
And then they made it illegal to hunt
them and they made him a protected

358
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:08,461
species.

359
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,840
But then they fucked up.

360
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,270
They over protected.

361
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,630
And those goddamn super
lizards are everywhere now.

362
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,210
Fucking everywhere.

363
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,960
My mom belongs to a golf course
down in Florida where she lives.

364
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,060
And there's this alligator's apparently
like this fucking 14 foot alligator.

365
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,953
And uh,

366
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,330
the people were playing
golf and there was a deer.

367
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,111
And everybody's on the,

368
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:29,370
everybody's standing there going like,

369
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,250
it's a deer.

370
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,083
It's a deer.

371
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,990
Look at that beautiful
fucking alligator comes out,

372
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:34,860
grabs it,

373
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,420
pulls it into the water,

374
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,950
does that spin move?

375
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,780
Takes it to the bottom.

376
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:40,860
Fucking done.

377
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,410
So everyone's talking about it.

378
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:44,370
What do we do about it?

379
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,280
So about three weeks later,

380
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,690
my mom is out on the course and her
ball is right next to the lake where the

381
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:56,691
alligator is and she forgets and she goes
over and her ball is right on the edge

382
00:09:57,241 --> 00:10:01,440
and she's standing there and she was
standing on some fucking like dead,

383
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,970
some dead grass.

384
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:07,971
And he gave out and she fell in
the fucking lake up to her neck.

385
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,240
And then she remembered and she fucking
started scrambling up the mud and

386
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,220
grabbing at the reeds to get out of there.

387
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:17,521
And,

388
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:18,000
and,

389
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,980
and the people that she was with had left,

390
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,170
she was playing by herself for some reason
and she fucking got out of there and

391
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:26,190
got in the cart and,

392
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,660
and then she just started laughing.

393
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,793
Oh my God.

394
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,440
You believe that shit.

395
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,520
My little mother,

396
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,260
my little five foot two mother,

397
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,310
oh my God.

398
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,170
Would have been a tasty
meal happened so quick.

399
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,033
Yeah.

400
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,170
Better than a dear old lady.

401
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:43,430
Nice.

402
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,851
Soft.

403
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,760
A lady.

404
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,690
Way more tender.

405
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,853
Yeah.

406
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,090
Corn Fed.

407
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,521
My mom's corn fed.

408
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:51,354
I never told you that.

409
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,761
Yeah.

410
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:52,290
Yeah.

411
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,970
I thought she was organic now.

412
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:56,100
Now we let her free range sometimes.
