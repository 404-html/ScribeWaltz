1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,060
We know a guy who,

3
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:03,660
uh,

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:03,901
was,

5
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:04,440
uh,

6
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:04,830
like I,

7
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,250
I talk,

8
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,520
I tell the story now on stage
of the guy who used to drive us,

9
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,950
oh my God to the airport.

10
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,450
This was our driver,

11
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,310
like a regular guy cause we were,

12
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:14,971
we'd go to the airport.

13
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:15,990
So often we use this,

14
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,321
you know,

15
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:16,770
we found a,

16
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,540
like a cheaper car service.

17
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,600
It's easier than dealing with
like driving and parking and like,

18
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,111
he was,

19
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:22,740
uh,

20
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,230
you know,

21
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,420
it was like a cheap ride,

22
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:29,421
basically older guy and like all white
hair and was really professional.

23
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,211
And then like,

24
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,130
after like 10 rides,

25
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,000
one of those things where like,

26
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,481
you know,

27
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:36,330
when somebody is like Mr Rogue
and Mr and you finally go,

28
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:37,240
you can call me Joe.

29
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,221
It was like,

30
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,120
that kind of thing where I was like,

31
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:39,511
it's Tom,

32
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:40,344
he's like this Tom.

33
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:40,771
I'm like,

34
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:40,920
yeah.

35
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,221
He's like,

36
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:41,431
cool.

37
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,210
Hey Man,

38
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,901

39
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:43,051

As soon as I said,

42
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:45,150
like,

43
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,370
you don't have to be professional with me.

44
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,581
And he goes,

45
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,414
uh,

46
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,021

48
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:50,131

50
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:50,881
And he goes,

51
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:51,714

52
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,410
And I was like,

57
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:54,840
yeah.

58
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,171
He's like,

59
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,130
do you want to smoke something now?

60
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,581
And I was like,

61
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:57,020
really?

62
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,790
It's like,

63
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:57,970

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,260
All right.

70
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,100
And then you said,

71
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:02,341

72
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:02,611

00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:02,970
Yeah.

74
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:03,210
Okay,

that's exactly what's in my head.

78
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:06,330
Comfortable with you in my life.

79
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,590
And then he goes,

80
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,510
he starts smoking and then he goes,

81
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,100
I can't drive unless I'm fucked up.

82
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,600
That's a quo,

83
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,440
it's like scene in a movie.

84
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,583
And then

85
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,930
I swear to God,

86
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,323
Shit.

87
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,783
And he goes,

88
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,450

89
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,440

He drives fast.

93
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:34,741
He's like,

94
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:35,430

95
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,960

109
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,090
I start asking him,

110
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:48,391
I'm like,

111
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,950

112
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:50,180
He's like,

113
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,270

00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,460
He's like coke heroin.

118
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:54,751
He's like,

119
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,100

120
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,253

121
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,890
And I was like 17 and he is flying
through El Barrio through the old

122
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,214

181
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,110
You know what the fuck's going to happen?

182
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,620
People come and get you.

183
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,100

185
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,140

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,390

193
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:43,700

196
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,470
I can't say his last name.

197
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,470
I don't know his last name.

198
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,311
Henry.

199
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:47,850
The eighth.

200
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,890
So the best is,

201
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:50,230

202
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,750
like in this sounds like it sounds,

203
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,430
I swear this is exactly how it goes.

204
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:54,150
I go,

205
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,620
so do you still do that shit?

206
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,813
And he goes,

207
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,841
Nah man,

208
00:03:57,841 --> 00:03:58,091

209
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:58,191

210
00:03:58,191 --> 00:03:58,380
no.

211
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,830
He goes,

212
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,663
well,

213
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,593
you know,

214
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,620
every once in a while,

215
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:05,010
but you know what they say if you
do something every once in awhile,

216
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,450
it's not that bad for you.

217
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,990
And I go,

218
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,550
I think they mean that about like pizza,

219
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,760
like chocolate.

220
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,883
And he's like,

221
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,430

222
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,263

223
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,270
I swear to God every once in a while.

224
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,530
Do you remember when the
mayor of Washington DC got
caught smoke Marion Berry?

225
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,011
Yeah,

226
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,100
with an FBI agent in a fucking
hotel room or an informant.

227
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,570
He was being a prostitute.

228
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:26,891
Yeah,

229
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,141
yeah,

230
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:27,650
yeah.

231
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,311
You remember that Shit.

232
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,930
He was smoking Crenn running
the nation's capitol.

233
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,740
And then when they ask people about it,

234
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,590
the greatest thing was
after he got caught,

235
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,630
this guy I met with this guy on TV,

236
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:38,961
they say,

237
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:41,950
what do you think about the mayor
getting caught smoking crack goes man.

238
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,220
And by some a little cracking,

239
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,530
but now and then every now and he said,

240
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,220
everybody smoke a little
crack every now and then.

241
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,330
This guy was on TV.

242
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:50,571
He's like,

243
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:51,350
come on man,

244
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,183

245
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,713
Stop playing

246
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,871

247
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:27,651

248
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,060
