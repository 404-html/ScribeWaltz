1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:07,410
Silver worked real good experience by 
request of Dr.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,050
Rhonda.
Patrick.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,670
You want it to have that music.
So there you go.

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,220
Now that's how we do it for you.
I appreciate you out.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,400
How about that?
Because of you will do it from here on 

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,400
out.
Like you know,

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,640
there's something about it that makes 
you feel good.

8
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:29,460
It gets a little opening or something.
Little something.

9
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:34,461
Something.
Has there ever been a study on what 

10
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:36,291
exactly music does to the mind?
Like an inspirational song when you're 

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:36,450
on a treadmill that makes you keep 
going?

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,630
Oh man,
it makes all the difference for me.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,360
All the difference.
I don't know.

14
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:43,380
I don't know if they've done that exact 
study,

15
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:48,381
but I'm sure there's been studies that 
have been done looking at how music 

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:48,381
affects the brain.
Yeah.

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,190
I just don't know.
Yeah,

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,650
there's something going on.
It's 100 percent.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,620
Right.
I mean when,

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,560
when a song is,
it has to be.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,800
It has to work with,
you know what if it's a song that was 

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:00,800
your song,
like flash dance,

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,240
but that's good.
I really liked him and out to the 

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,850
stones.
I really liked the.

25
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:06,720
Rolling Stones.
Yeah.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,160
And I also like it when it's like,
you know,

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,180
maybe some ACDC like okay,
I need some motivation to like push past

28
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,800
that.
Yeah,

29
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,900
that's what I listened to in the,
in the a cryogenic chamber.

30
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,290
I listened to back in black because it 
just seems like a good song for that 

31
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,060
dude.
This morning I,

32
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,480
after I did a workout I get a cold 
shower and I was like singing in the 

33
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,600
cold shower because it's so cold.
It was like me singing and I was like,

34
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:37,060
yeah,
no,

35
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,340
we're hoping to fit in my brand.

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,480
And like Dan was like trying to record 
video but like audio,

37
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,160
he was like trying to record it for 
snapchat but he failed miserably and um,

38
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,020
but I stayed in for five minutes and the
singing was like,

39
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,760
yeah,
it helped me push past that.

40
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:58,761
This is cold as fuck.
So you did it just for the 

41
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,570
norepinephrine just for the.
Did I say that right?

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
Yes,
you did.

43
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,310
Thank you.
I did,

44
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,530
I did it.
I did that.

45
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:09,531
Plus I try,
I tried doing high intensity workout so 

46
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:10,080
I was trying to sprint faster than I 
usually do,

47
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,470
so I like to do a lot of aerobic.
I do aerobics and I like to mix it up 

48
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,440
with some resistance training for 
different reasons.

49
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:19,890
In the same day.
I usually do mix it up,

50
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,870
but not always.
It depends.

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,020
It depends.
I like to like,

52
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,760
you know,
sometimes I'll start off with Iran and I

53
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:29,170
don't,
I don't do like long long runs.

54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,200
It's like two miles,
you know enough to like get some brain 

55
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,871
drive neurotrophic factor growing,
which is a growth factor that helps you 

56
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:40,690
grow new neurons.
That's been shown to happen with more of

57
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,720
aerobic type of exercise,
but then the high intensity interval 

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,590
training like sprinting or I'll do 
bodies,

59
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,050
body weight squats or push ups or you 
know,

60
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,890
these backward types of pushups.
Then whatever it's going to like,

61
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,720
get me doing that high intensity sort of
thing where you're,

62
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,750
you're actually producing lactate 
because your body is using glucose since

63
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,350
you can't get oxygen to your muscles 
quick enough for how quick you're like,

64
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,740
you know,
applying for us and putting this 

65
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:13,740
energetic,
energetic demand,

66
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,790
use glucose and you don't use it inside 
the Mitochondria.

67
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,740
I mean you don't,
you don't need oxygen,

68
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,740
so you do it without oxygen and you make
lactate is a byproduct.

69
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,210
Will lactate's been shown to increase 
dramatically a lactate uptake into the,

70
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,260
into the brain.
It increases dramatically upon I'm that 

71
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,380
type of exercise and it's lactate that's
fueling norepinephrine released.

72
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,700
So like you're making more lactate to 
make more norepinephrine and your brain.

73
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,770
So,
and norepinephrine is,

74
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,130
it has an immediate effect of making the
connections between your neurons 

75
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,510
stronger so that you remember things 
better.

76
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,980
Um,
and so that you learn better and you 

77
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:51,980
remember better.
It's called longterm potentiation.

78
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,720
So I was like,
I need my brain to work today.

79
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,550
I'm going to do that stuff.
Yeah.

80
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,790
Whereas the Abramovic type of exercise 
has more of a longterm effect because 

81
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,970
you're making more neurons,
uh,

82
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:04,180
but those,
those neurons take two weeks to mature.

83
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:09,181
So like the aerobic training that I did,
those effects will come two weeks from 

84
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,120
now when I'm,
I have more neurons,

85
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,450
but you know,
so the immediate effect of the lactate 

86
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,021
and making an effort and it's happening 
right now because right now the 

87
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:19,021
connections between my neurons are 
stronger.

88
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:22,240
So and plus it also makes you feel good.
Um,

89
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,830
it,
that's crazy though.

90
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:28,831
There's a physical effect like that.
There's a physical effect of your brain 

91
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:31,780
actually functioning better.
Like there's a direct mechanism involved

92
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:34,480
in your brain functioning better because
of exercise.

93
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,900
It's so.
I have been so obsessed with this lately

94
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:42,901
like this and I know that I have like 
probably we've talked about this before 

95
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:45,160
and I talk to people probably get sick 
of me talking about it,

96
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:50,161
but this concept of stressing your body 
stressing exercise.

97
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,340
Most people think exercise is good 
because the exercise itself is good.

98
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:59,341
No,
the exercise of this exact exercise 

99
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,591
itself is not good.
It's actually very stressful on your 

100
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:02,920
body.
And what's good is the stress response,

101
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:07,921
the body.
We've got a hard wired genetic program 

102
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,470
that is conserved in plants,
insects,

103
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,350
bacteria,
primates,

104
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,520
humans,
you know,

105
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:17,110
we're,
we're all,

106
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:19,300
we all have this response to stress.

107
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,480
And that response is to try to survive.
I need,

108
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,880
I need to stay alive past on my genes.
Obviously the stress response is much 

109
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,771
stronger.
I'm younger when you're younger or the 

110
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:35,341
earlier in life because your body knows 
you're not old enough to reproduce for 

111
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:37,000
whatever,
you know,

112
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,680
hormones and things like that.
They're not being produced.

113
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:42,490
But um,
so the stress response,

114
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:46,120
which is like exercise causes stress,
thermal stress,

115
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:51,121
like heat cold.
And then there's all these compounds in 

116
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:52,600
plants that are a stressful to us that 
can induce this.

117
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:57,601
But it's almost like the brain is 
preparing for the next time it's going 

118
00:05:57,701 --> 00:05:58,760
to encounter stress.
It's like,

119
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,840
okay,
this is war.

120
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,720
I got to gather up the troops,
I gotta get this army.

121
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:05,390
We got to assemble this army because 
that stress is going to happen again.

122
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,630
I got to pray for war.
So it kind of makes sense that you're,

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,120
you're going to have a very profound and
positive effect in your brain and also 

124
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,150
in other parts of the body.

125
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,530
I'm,
you know,

126
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,460
the exercise itself.
Um,

127
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,200
it's funny because a lot of people do it
to lose weight or to mostly to lose 

128
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,720
weight or you know,
become sexually attractive muscle mass,

129
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,750
which has other very important 
physiological effects,

130
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:32,090
but people do it because they want to 
look good.

131
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,310
Um,
and honestly,

132
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,050
a lot of,
there are a lot of people that say,

133
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:41,051
well,
exercise doesn't really play an 

134
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:41,051
important role in losing weight.
It's nutrition.

135
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:44,621
You know what the right,
but exercise has a very important role 

136
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,681
and that role is to,
to cause your body stress so that you 

137
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:52,631
activate all these really good and 
awesome jeans that are helping you deal 

138
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:53,240
with stress.
And guess what?

139
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,690
Stress is happening right now.
Every time you breathe in oxygen,

140
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,880
your making stress,
you're,

141
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,420
you're generating byproducts that are 
very dangerous.

142
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,310
So,
so exercise is good

143
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,990
with definitely good.
I just get freaked out when people that 

144
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:09,990
are really smart don't get into 
exercise.

145
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,490
And I just,
I always feel like that's just,

146
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,930
they have a blind spot,
you know,

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
there's,
there's a blind spot where they don't 

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
want to discipline themselves to 
actually do the work.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,130
They just find that troublesome.
Or maybe they connected with jocks or 

150
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,100
people that were assholes when they were
in school.

151
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,740
You know,
there's,

152
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:26,230
there's,
sometimes there's that connection

153
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,880
option.
Yeah.

154
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,540
They probably don't realize the,
the anti anxiety effects they have.

155
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,200
I mean it's,
some of the Anti.

156
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,300
I really also do it because I've got 
some kind of like hyperactive stress 

157
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:42,520
response,
stress,

158
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,290
hyper,
hypothalamus,

159
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,380
pituitary axis where you know,
I'm,

160
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,260
I'm prone to be like,
oh,

161
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,840
there's a tiger does lie.
I'm like,

162
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,100
you know,
it's always kind of like,

163
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,360
I'm ready.
I'm ready to fight.

164
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:53,680
You know,
something's coming to get me.

165
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,990
Sometimes when I'm really stressed I'll 
get night terrors.

166
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:59,500
So like I'll wake up screaming.
It scared the crap out of Dan.

167
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,980
Jesus really not used to be a lot.
Like when I was in graduate school and I

168
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:06,640
was really,
really stressed.

169
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,820
I would wake up and I just scream.
I thought there was like someone coming 

170
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,430
to get me and you know,
there was times where I actually injured

171
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:19,720
myself too because I flew across the 
room because.

172
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,290
Because I thought that there was someone
coming to get me so,

173
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,080
so that more than once.
Oh yeah.

174
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,590
Yeah.
I hurt my wrist hurt like my,

175
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,550
like some tendon back here.
I broke them near Jesus.

176
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,260
Yeah,
like once a month.

177
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,880
Once a week.
Well now a days.

178
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:41,881
It's like almost nonexistent.
I would say it happens once every,

179
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,550
maybe four months.
But there was a time not too long ago,

180
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,780
like three years ago where I was doing 
it at least a couple times a week.

181
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,190
Once,
once a week for sure.

182
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,370
That's so weird.
I've

183
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,280
always associated people that are like 
really paranoid about fear,

184
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,860
about danger,
whether with intelligence,

185
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:05,130
because it's like if you actually pay 
attention to the world around you,

186
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:08,790
you realize how vulnerable you are and 
how many random things can happen.

187
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,370
Random accidents,
bizarre occurrences,

188
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,210
run into the wrong people.
The wrong place at the wrong time,

189
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,910
you know?
And we're so easily damaged.

190
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,880
Take that as a compliment.
But you know,

191
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,140
I think there,
you know,

192
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:30,141
there's definitely something,
it's kind of an ocd loop sometimes 

193
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:32,850
tonight and I'll get that where it just 
and it's so bad like you just get going.

194
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,400
I think I haven't even talked about on 
the podcast before,

195
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:39,120
like there was a time when I was scared 
to drive like,

196
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,160
and even now I,
I drive but I feel most comfortable 

197
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,160
driving in a place that I'm very 
familiar with.

198
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,470
But if I start to let my brain think 
about it,

199
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,240
it's like driving scary.

200
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,680
Yeah.
Well it should be.

201
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,930
You look around and all these people 
that are texting to so few people are 

202
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,890
giving 100 percent of their attention to
the road these days.

203
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,620
There's so much going on.
Self driving cars.

204
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,990
I'm actually looking forward to that.
But they have them now.

205
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,450
Well they're not,
they're not ubiquitous or not.

206
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,520
They're not.
You know,

207
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,570
people aren't using them.
Well my friend has one and no,

208
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,630
he drives with the new Tesla.
You press two buttons on it and it 

209
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,210
literally drives on the highway.
It turns.

210
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,010
Yup.
Yup.

211
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,050
He sits back.
He doesn't even put his fucking hands on

212
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:19,950
the wheel.
He's like,

213
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,720
it's the craziest shit you've ever seen 
in your life.

214
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,230
He,
Tom,

215
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:22,950
Papa,
Tom,

216
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,550
papa has to.
It was were the new teslas.

217
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:31,551
We're only allowing to let you park.
I didn't realize you could actually 

218
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:31,551
drive on the highway.

219
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,440
The newest versions of them drive on the
highway.

220
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:37,150
I have two friends that have them and 
you pray.

221
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,300
I guess there's a button,
that navigation button.

222
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:44,301
You Punch in the information and then 
you press it twice and this sucker will 

223
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:46,590
drive you to where you need to go.
That's pretty cool.

224
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,780
It doesn't work on Shitty old roads 
though.

225
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,910
Like Tom Papa was talking about Laurel 
Canyon.

226
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,060
Laurel Canyon has got kind of like it 
goes by computer sensors that are 

227
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,770
detecting the lines based on the cameras
that the car has.

228
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,160
So the car has these external cameras,
they see the lines and then they adjust 

229
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,120
accordingly.
But when the lines are really wonky,

230
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,310
like if you.
We're going to over Laurel Canyon,

231
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,740
I don't think I have.
It's really shitty.

232
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Le Rose kind of bumpy.
A lot of potholes and the lines are 

233
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,140
really blurry.
They're worn out.

234
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,700
Yeah.
So on that.

235
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,440
Yeah,
I'm sure you have,

236
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,200
but on a really good road it works 
great.

237
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,670
Like it just drives.
I'm,

238
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,860
I'm,
I'm,

239
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,280
I mean sign me up.
Yeah.

240
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:34,281
I mean I want everyone else to be in 
because I'm actually afraid of everyone 

241
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,030
else that's even like coming into La.
Like we drive into La.

242
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,230
I don't know.
People here are crazy drivers.

243
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,910
People swerving.
I mean just constantly swerving.

244
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,970
I don't know if people are just really 
aggressive because there's so many 

245
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:49,970
people and you have to.
I don't know.

246
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,960
That's exactly noticed it.
There was a study,

247
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,590
there's an episode of radio lab about 
this or they did a study on volume of 

248
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,580
people in cities and what affect the 
volume of people has on a how many 

249
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,350
syllables per minute they say and how 
many steps per minute they take and 

250
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,561
there's a direct correlation worldwide 
between higher populations and like you 

251
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:16,501
can literally guess if you.
If you set up a camera on a street and 

252
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:20,881
you record all the people walking by and
you get a good number of people when you

253
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:26,221
calculate how fast are walking and then 
you record them talking just from those 

254
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:30,811
two pieces of data.
You can tell how many people are in the 

255
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:30,811
city like

256
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:31,190
so,
but let's see if I can guess so.

257
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:34,070
If there's more people in the city,
do you walk faster and talk less?

258
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,210
No.
You Walk Faster,

259
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:37,400
you talk faster,
talk faster,

260
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,020
talk faster,
and you walk faster.

261
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,470
Both of those things.
But if there's a direct correlation 

262
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,570
there,
looking at the speed of how you talk,

263
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:46,580
not how frequent you talk.
Exactly,

264
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,300
exactly how fast you talk,
how quickly walk,

265
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,430
because I feel like the faster you walk,
the more you're like,

266
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,060
got to go,
go,

267
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:53,450
go,
go,

268
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,190
go.
The less likely you're going to stop and

269
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,780
talk to someone.
Do you know what I mean?

270
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:57,890
So it's kind of like,
it's just like,

271
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,550
you know,
hey man,

272
00:12:58,551 --> 00:12:59,670
I got to go,
you know,

273
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,780
we're going to do to go get a fucking go
downtown and there's a lot of shit going

274
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:03,260
on.
See it,

275
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,500
buy this.
Whereas if you go to the middle of rural

276
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,160
Tennessee will.

277
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,230
Hello,
what's your name?

278
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,670
Dr.
Rhonda will.

279
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:12,830
Very nice to meet you.
Dr Rhonda,

280
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,130
what kind of Doctor Are you?
I guess that could be why there's sort 

281
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,330
of a,
a stereotype that people in the south or

282
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,070
a little friendlier.
Maybe they just,

283
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,700
maybe that's why there's less people.
They have more time,

284
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,100
more time.
I know I get in this loop or it's like 

285
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,520
I'm so busy.
I know you're super busy where it's just

286
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:31,910
like,
dude,

287
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:32,870
I don't have time.
I gotta go,

288
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:33,890
I got this,
I got.

289
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,920
I'm trying to get out of that.
Yeah,

290
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,390
I think it's a good balance.
You need a balance,

291
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,580
you know there's,
you need that drive,

292
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:42,080
that motivation.
It's good to like,

293
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,260
you're obviously doing something 
productive that's contributing to 

294
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,260
society.
You,

295
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,920
you're fulfilling,
you feel like you're fulfilling 

296
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,670
something.
But also then did life just goes.

297
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,560
It's like it goes quick,
quick.

298
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,030
It goes quick and you know,
I'm almost 50,

299
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,200
48,
I'll be 49 in August and then like this 

300
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,310
is my body works great now,
but for how long,

301
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,830
you know,
nobody's body works great at 70,

302
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,530
it just doesn't,
they're all shitty.

303
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,950
They're all show.
Everybody's holding their back and 

304
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,440
they're fucking knees hurt.
When you hit 80,

305
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,790
who's an athlete at 80?
Who's doing cartwheels at 80 and,

306
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,230
and you know,
and doing chin ups in a row,

307
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,280
it's just not happening.

308
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,060
I used to surf with a guy back when I 
was in college.

309
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,490
Who was,
he was a surgeon,

310
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:32,820
who's Dr we called him doc and uh,
he was pushing 90,

311
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:34,200
I don't remember,
like 88,

312
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:35,350
89 or he was,
you know,

313
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,140
we rounded up and is like,
he's 90,

314
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,420
but he was out there surfing,
catching waves.

315
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,600
Now I'm sure it wasn't like competing,
um,

316
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,810
but I,
I do think that the more physically fit 

317
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,710
you are and the more,
you know,

318
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,890
throughout your life and the better you 
eat,

319
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,630
these things are all going to affect the
way you age.

320
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,990
They're all going to affect,
you know,

321
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,930
how much pain you're in,
you know,

322
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,960
all that stuff.
And obviously losing muscle mass as big 

323
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,250
thing starting in mid middle,
starting at 40 humans start to lose like

324
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,810
point five to one percent or something 
like that.

325
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,580
Muscle mass per year,
uh,

326
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:11,060
just without,
without doing anything.

327
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,470
That makes sense.
Yeah.

328
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:17,030
I think that that's probably one of the 
more difficult things to gain as you get

329
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:19,310
older.
So if you can maintain it,

330
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,550
you know,
you're way better off because if you 

331
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,231
just,
if you're out of shape your whole life 

332
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:26,231
and then also in your pushing 60 and 
you're like,

333
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:26,870
you know what,
I need to get to the gym.

334
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,380
Well it's so hard to make gains.
It's so hard to do,

335
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,640
you know,
any sort of like real resistance 

336
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:35,990
training on a regular basis and you're 
going to be so sore,

337
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,760
it's going to be so hard to build a 
base.

338
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,120
So it's a much more difficult route.
It's difficult now.

339
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:44,330
And you know that resistance training,
it's something,

340
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,510
I don't know a lot about this but it's a
topic that I'm interested in,

341
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,570
you know,
because I'm convinced that maintaining 

342
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,360
muscle mass is very important as you 
age.

343
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,360
And specifically I think that the type,
the type two type of muscle fibers that 

344
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,790
you're,
that you do get when you're doing more 

345
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:03,790
resistance training,
those are the kind of fast twitch.

346
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,140
I think those actually play a role in 
like stability,

347
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,500
being able to like quickly,
like lose your balance or which is 

348
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,701
important as you start to get older and 
you become more frail and falling down 

349
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:16,790
and breaking your hip can.
That can take you out.

350
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,820
Like that's a big problem.
That's another thing that bone density 

351
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,760
gets increased by muscle resistance 
training,

352
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,450
weight training,
squats,

353
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:25,880
dead lifts,
things along those lines.

354
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,520
That has a pretty profound effect on 
bone density.

355
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:34,060
There's a,
there's a hormone that's actually 

356
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,221
released,
I think from muscle tissue called Iris 

357
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:38,930
and that is released when you're doing 
resistance training and uh,

358
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,300
possibly also during a robot,
I'm not sure,

359
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:41,900
but it does.

360
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,880
It plays a role in helping maintain 
your,

361
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,120
your bone density as well as 
osteocalcin.

362
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:52,121
Osteocalcin released osteocalcin then 
gets into your bloodstream at pulls 

363
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:53,930
calcium out of your bloodstream and 
brings it back to the bone.

364
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:54,880
So,
you know,

365
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,890
the thing is,
is that most of the calcium that we 

366
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,700
store in our body is in our bone or 
teeth and bones and muscle,

367
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,630
but I'm calcium plays a very important 
role in the bloodstream as well.

368
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:09,170
So anytime we're not getting enough 
calcium,

369
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:14,171
and I think something like 38 percent of
the US population doesn't get enough 

370
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:17,291
calcium like so there's.
There's a huge percentage of the 

371
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,370
population doesn't get enough calcium 
and whenever you don't get enough,

372
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:24,371
your body actually pulls it out of the 
bone and brings it to bloodstream so 

373
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:28,241
that it can play an important role in 
endothelial cells and making sure they 

374
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:28,241
don't get to step.

375
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:30,710
And so that's where osteoporosis come 
saying yeah,

376
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:35,711
because as you age,
if you imagine a lifetime of chronic 

377
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:37,100
calcium,
quote unquote inadequacy,

378
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:38,480
so you're,
you're never,

379
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,410
you're never getting enough of the 
calcium every day.

380
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,470
Eventually that's going to start to 
build up and you're gonna keep pulling 

381
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:47,470
it out of your bone.
You're gonna.

382
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:47,470
Keep pulling it out of bone.
You know there's a,

383
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:49,170
there's a couple of things that regulate
that.

384
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:54,171
That's one,
just obviously just not getting enough 

385
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:57,021
calcium so you keep pulling it out of 
your bone and the other thing is not 

386
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:59,781
getting enough of the so doing,
doing the types of exercises that you 

387
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:03,660
need to do to make sure you're releasing
these hormones that are bringing calcium

388
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:05,190
to the bone that are,
you know,

389
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,100
doing that.
Um,

390
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,790
and also certain dietary factors can 
play a role in that.

391
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,060
So making sure that you're getting 
enough vitaminK ,

392
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,320
two,
vitaminK ,

393
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,090
one is found in green plants.

394
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,120
It plays a role in blood coagulation 
when you have enough of it for that 

395
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,171
blood coagulation.
Then some vitaminK stays around the 

396
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,901
bloodstream and activates osteocalcin 
and other genes that are able to pull 

397
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:31,191
the calcium to the bone.
Vitamin K two never really goes to the 

398
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:34,500
liver and that's um,
something that's found in fermented sort

399
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:39,501
of a bacteria make it so like you can 
find vitamin K two in the western diet,

400
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,060
like cheeses,
bleu cheese is fermented.

401
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:46,050
Cheeses have a higher amount.
There's some in organ meats like liver,

402
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,550
but Natto fermented soybeans are the 
highest fermented soybeans,

403
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,160
not toe to toe.
Yeah,

404
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,300
they've got like,
if you're comparing like cheese or even 

405
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,950
organ meat to Natto,
looking at k two levels,

406
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:02,010
there's no comparison.
Not toes got a huge amount.

407
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,870
I've never even heard of that stuff.
It's pretty big in the health community.

408
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,870
Um,
it's also high in something else called 

409
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,870
Spermatozoa,
which,

410
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,350
um,
is able to clear away damaged cells in 

411
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:20,781
your body.
And it's called drip process called a 

412
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:23,331
topic Ge.
So we're always getting damaged cells 

413
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:23,670
and anytime we have a salt that's 
damaged,

414
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,860
damaged cells occur,
um,

415
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,320
you know,
just just from normal metabolism.

416
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,760
But as our telomeres get shorter,
um,

417
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:36,530
the team always take the hit.
So tila mirrors are those tiny caps on 

418
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,321
the end of your chromosomes and they 
always are like sacrificing themselves 

419
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:42,291
because they don't want your dna to get 
the damage because if your dna gets 

420
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:42,390
damaged,
it could lead to cancer.

421
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,810
So they take the hit and as they start 
to get shorter,

422
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:48,810
it accelerates their shortening because 
they already get shorter each year.

423
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,350
Then what happens is the cell becomes 
what's called senescent.

424
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,950
And what that means is the cell just 
sits around in your bloodstream or in 

425
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,410
your kidney or your liver or whatever 
organ we're talking about,

426
00:19:58,411 --> 00:19:59,910
and it's not really alive.

427
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,850
So it's not mel metabolic,
but it doesn't like go away.

428
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:07,851
It's not dead.
So what does it just sits there and it 

429
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,150
starts to secrete I'm pro inflammatory 
cytokines,

430
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:14,151
which then activate nearby immune cells 
to like fire away nasty chemicals in 

431
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,020
damage,
more cells.

432
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:17,400
So what happens is you start to damage 
nearby cells.

433
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:23,050
You can think about like,
have you ever noticed like when you get 

434
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,050
a gray hair,
so gray hair,

435
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,500
you'll get senescent Malana sites,
which are the cells that produce the 

436
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:30,020
pigment.
You'll get one that senescence.

437
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:35,030
So it's just kind of sitting there and 
it causes a hair follicle and her hair 

438
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,670
gray.
And then all the other hairstyles around

439
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,010
nearby.
You always get them near each other.

440
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,760
And part of that has to do with the fact
that these senescent mental Melana site 

441
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:46,760
in this case,
which is,

442
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,130
you know,
in the hair follicle,

443
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,530
is to creating all this nasty stuff that
then damages other nearby,

444
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,440
um,
hair soft.

445
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,010
Wow,
that's fascinating.

446
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,550
So,
oh,

447
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:55,810
so anyways,
back to the spermatids,

448
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:00,930
the spermatids actually clears away it,
it activates this whole genetic system 

449
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:03,940
we have in our body called autophagy,
which is like self eating.

450
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,330
So we start to like eat this cell and 
cleared away.

451
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,570
And recently,
like within the last month a study came 

452
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,650
out where scientists actually engineered
mice,

453
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,970
uh,
using crispr technology to clear away 

454
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:19,970
all the,
every time they had a senescent cell.

455
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,700
You and I are getting senescent cells 
right now,

456
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,620
but right now,
sorry Jamie,

457
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,930
it's happening.
It's like it's happening all the time.

458
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,340
Um,
but,

459
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,120
but the researchers did this brilliant 
experiment where they designed,

460
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,110
um,
they were like,

461
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,610
okay,
it's an essence cell,

462
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,980
has a certain marker on it.
And so they then said,

463
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:37,420
okay,
when this marker gets expressed,

464
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,090
I want you to have the,
you have the,

465
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,280
these immune cells go and cleared away 
and eat it.

466
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,190
And so every time there's a senescent 
cell,

467
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,700
the immune system cleared it out and the
mice ended up living 30 percent longer 

468
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,710
than their normal lifespan.
Pretty cool topic.

469
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,760
It's called.
It's pretty cool.

470
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:58,870
And there are other things that actually
increase it resveratrol.

471
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,750
Brisbane was very trial from,
it's,

472
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,710
it's a one of those plant compounds 
that's the spin,

473
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:11,711
a recent obsession of mine.
But plants make like natural 

474
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:15,550
insecticides and you know,
for millions of years,

475
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:20,530
plants have been figuring out a way to 
like ward off insects and fungus and you

476
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:25,531
know,
because they also want to stay alive 

477
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:27,750
just like we do and they don't actually 
make enough of this camp like these 

478
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,150
chemicals to kill the insect.
It's Kinda like just go away.

479
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,070
So they often affect their nervous 
system,

480
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,290
um,
and just kind of make them go away.

481
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:40,291
But what's really cool is that these 
compounds in plants and there's so many 

482
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:43,870
different ones actually have a hormetic 
effect on us.

483
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,450
So that hormetic effect being in small 
doses,

484
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,940
it activates our whole stress response 
pathway,

485
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:53,941
like exercise does.
And so I'm raspberry trolley is actually

486
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:57,800
made in grape skins.
And also blueberries make to a much less

487
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,100
degree,
but it's made to ward off fungus.

488
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,720
And resveratrol has been shown,
at least if it's in a high dose,

489
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,770
like was milligrams a day to clear away,
it activates,

490
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,280
it actually activates this whole genetic
pathway that gets activated when you're 

491
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,191
fasting.
Fasting is another type of hormetic 

492
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:17,191
stress.
So when you're fasting,

493
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:21,900
you cause damage cells to clear away.
You also basically start to turn on all 

494
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,390
these genes that help you deal with 
stress because your body's like,

495
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:26,320
oh my God,
I can't,

496
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,260
I don't have food.
I,

497
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,450
you know,
I need to deal with this.

498
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,200
So you activate all these really good,
you know,

499
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,240
genetic pathways where you're making 
more antioxidants are making more 

500
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,490
antiinflammatories,
you're making more brain cells,

501
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:37,720
you're preparing,
um,

502
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,830
just everything good.

503
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,300
Um,
so it was a virtual kind of his thought 

504
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,681
of it,
like a mimetic of fasting in a way 

505
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:49,831
because it activates like one of these 
pathways that get activated and it 

506
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:51,040
changes gene expression.
I've been very skeptical.

507
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:56,130
There was virtual literature for quite 
some time back in 2003 or so when it was

508
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:59,960
a first first kind of came into the 
aging world.

509
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,990
I was very skeptical of it mostly 
because a lot of the studies that had 

510
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,600
been done in animals where they feed 
animals,

511
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:10,601
Rivera trawl,
they feed them such large amounts that 

512
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:11,420
are just like not relevant to humans.
So I was like,

513
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:11,960
well,
so what,

514
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,020
you know,
but the more I've been reading about it 

515
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,691
recently,
the more I've become a little more 

516
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:19,691
convinced that there actually may be 
something to,

517
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:24,310
to this reserve or trial.
It's activating this pathway called 

518
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,200
[inaudible] one,
which is globally changing gene 

519
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,200
expression,
epigenetics.

520
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,520
It's,
it's,

521
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,860
it's activating all these good things 
and deactivating bad things.

522
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,420
And so,
um,

523
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,580
there's really,
it's really interesting.

524
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:36,710
There was a study that was published not
long ago,

525
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,920
a couple of years ago that was done in 
monkeys were monkeys were given a high 

526
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,130
sugar diet and a high sugar high fat,
which is a bad combo.

527
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,560
And it gave him a spiritual,
you know,

528
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,280
either gave them a spiritual or didn't.
And the monkeys,

529
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:54,281
I did not get resveratrol.
Their arteries were like really stiffed 

530
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:58,030
the,
caused their arteries to stiff by like 

531
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,591
40 percent.
But there was very raspberry trial 

532
00:24:59,591 --> 00:24:59,990
completely negated that.
So I was like,

533
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:04,991
wow,
maybe I should start looking into the 

534
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:04,991
rivera trial again because it's a 
little,

535
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:05,420
it's a little interesting.
But,

536
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,880
um,
there's so many other plant.

537
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:12,881
There's a book that was written by an 
Indian scientists called plant an Antifa

538
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:16,580
dense and it's a very dry.

539
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,540
I mean,
it's a textbook,

540
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,150
so it's not like something people like 
read,

541
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,770
like for it.
It's a textbook really.

542
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,240
But what it,
what it does,

543
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,200
what he does in this book is there's 
over 900 different chemical compounds in

544
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:32,201
like a variety of plants.
He's a plant in a PR specialist.

545
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:33,560
So he,
that's his specialty.

546
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,510
And he categorizes like over 900 of 
these compounds were these,

547
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,940
these compounds are,
you know,

548
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,600
potentially going to induce a hormetic 
response.

549
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,050
And so I know several scientists are 
actually using some of these compounds 

550
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,801
that are at least listed in this book to
study their effects in mice and 

551
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,280
eventually in humans.
But like some of them,

552
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,010
like I'm plumage in plumage ins and 
black walnuts and it's bench.

553
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,630
It actually causes a slight stress in 
our brain.

554
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,110
And um,
it has been shown in mice to protect 

555
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,360
against ischemic stroke because it's 
like,

556
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,710
it activates all these good things.

557
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,750
It protects against this ischemic 
stroke.

558
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,630
Um,
there's another one called galantamine,

559
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:16,631
which is in snowdrop flowers,
galantamine is it also stressful in the 

560
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:17,330
brain?
Like I said,

561
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:22,331
these,
these plant compounds are designed to 

562
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,331
target and sick nervous system.
So it's no surprise that are affecting 

563
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:26,150
the nervous system of,
of mammals.

564
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,770
And in fact,
in this case,

565
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:32,771
humans swell,
galantamine increases acetylcholine 

566
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:35,951
production in the brain and 
acetylcholine plays a role in learning 

567
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:38,330
and memory and it's actually given to 
Alzheimer's patients,

568
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,840
galantamine to help them remember 
things,

569
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:43,500
to help them with their,
to improve their memory.

570
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,510
But it's,
it's,

571
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,870
it's just one of those natural 
insecticides on alcohol.

572
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:52,871
Ian is a nootropic.
A lot of people take acetylcholine just 

573
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:53,280
from memory.
Well,

574
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,860
the thing I like about the getting it 
from,

575
00:26:55,861 --> 00:27:00,861
I'm getting it from getting it from a 
hormetic type of response versus like 

576
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,380
let's say someone designed a drug to,
um,

577
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,660
to activate the subtle colon receptor,
is that you always have these biological

578
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,090
feedback mechanisms when you're.

579
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,250
When you start to activate a receptor in
the brain,

580
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,620
pharmacologically,
your brain,

581
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,360
your brain knows your brain's like,
oh,

582
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:20,850
I'm getting a lot of this stuff that I 
don't usually get a lot of.

583
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,550
I'm going to stop making as much of the 
receptor.

584
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:26,910
The receptor is what's necessary to have
the physiological response.

585
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,050
So your brain's like,
oh,

586
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,390
I'm just going to stop making as much of
this receptor.

587
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,070
But then what happens is if you don't 
give it that signal,

588
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,080
if you don't take that drug,
then you've got less of that receptor 

589
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,950
and so you're going to have massive,
like withdrawal.

590
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,510
It's going to be like crazy because now 
whatever acetylcholine you do make,

591
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,750
it's not going to have much in effect 
because there's less of that receptor 

592
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,021
there to actually bind to it.
Whereas when you have something like 

593
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:56,550
galantamine something that's a hormetic 
inducer,

594
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,790
what's happening is you're actually,
you're not actually doing anything to 

595
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,780
acetylcholine neurons or to,
to,

596
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,520
uh,
the,

597
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,680
the receptor or anything directly.

598
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,860
It's slightly slightly toxic and part of
the way your brain deals with the type 

599
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,000
of stress that it induces is it goes,
oh,

600
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:16,450
this is the kind of stress I need to 
make.

601
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:18,990
I need a seal calling for this for 
whatever reason,

602
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,920
whatever,
you know,

603
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,620
these plants are doing different things.
For whatever reason,

604
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,140
the galantamine is like the one that 
says,

605
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:26,130
okay,
Acetylcholine,

606
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,370
so your body is,
it's a response to something kind of 

607
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:31,370
like triggering it,
you know?

608
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,650
And so you're not going to have that 
feedback mechanism where it's like.

609
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,160
So if you take it into pharmacological,
former pharmaceutical forum.

610
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,690
Yeah,
I'm just saying a lot of,

611
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,750
you know,
I mean the classic example would be a 

612
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,140
opioids opioid painkillers.
So when you're taking an opioid 

613
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:53,631
painkiller,
what's happening is there's a couple of 

614
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:57,000
different opioid receptors in the brain 
and the opioid painkillers,

615
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,360
kinda like a morphine derivative,
which is sort of like endorphin.

616
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,600
It binds to something called the new 
opioid receptor,

617
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,630
which is what endorphins bind to.
And that's endorphins make you feel 

618
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,421
good.
That's also part of the reason why you 

619
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:11,421
exercise while you,
you know,

620
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:11,520
you're,
you're wanting that endorphin release.

621
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,880
Um,
well what happens when you start to like

622
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,890
make a drug like morphine derivative 
type of drug that goes and directly 

623
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,630
activates that receptor,
binds to it is that receptor,

624
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,030
the new opioid receptor,
and you start to make less of it.

625
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,180
And that's been shown when you,
when you give morphine drugs,

626
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,940
you downregulate,
you make less of the receptors.

627
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,030
So now what happens is when you don't 
have that opioid drug,

628
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,790
you know,
let's say you had this much receptor,

629
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,560
you started taking the drug,
right?

630
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:39,840
And now your receptors going down here,
right?

631
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,130
And so now if you don't have the drug 
are down here,

632
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:44,050
and so any endorphin you make isn't 
gonna do much.

633
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,650
Like,
Oh man,

634
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:49,651
I need more of that.
And so you keep having just to get back 

635
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:49,720
up to baseline,
just to get back up to normal,

636
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,930
which is why you can have addiction.
Addiction can be very common with those 

637
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,801
types of painkillers because of the 
effect on the receptor new opioid 

638
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:00,520
receptor.
So that's,

639
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:02,380
you know,
that's one of the problems.

640
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:07,381
And interestingly enough,
there's another type of opioid receptor 

641
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:08,830
called the Kappa opioid receptor,
which,

642
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,920
um,
I've,

643
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,760
I think I've discussed with you before,
and one of the podcasts,

644
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:17,761
because a cap opioid receptors,
sort of the opposite of the new opioid 

645
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:22,141
receptor because it actually,
when you make something in your body 

646
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:25,861
called dynorphins it,
it's responsible for a dysphoric 

647
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:26,260
feeling.
Whereas new opioids,

648
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,340
euphoric,
you feel good.

649
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,640
Dysphoric feeling is the Kappa opioid 
you make dynorphins because it cools 

650
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:35,080
your body.
So when you're hot,

651
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:36,910
when you're,
when you exercise,

652
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,400
when you elevate your core,
but when you sweat,

653
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,960
that's a good sign.

654
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,540
When you're sweating,
you're making dynorphins.

655
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,580
When you sit in the sauna,
you're making dynorphins and you know 

656
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:47,920
when you're working out hard enough that
you're sweating,

657
00:30:47,921 --> 00:30:49,180
you're physically,
you're uncomfortable,

658
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:49,750
right?
You're like,

659
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:50,740
damn,
this sucks.

660
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,440
You feel uncomfortable.
And the same goes when you're sitting in

661
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:58,441
a,
in a hot sauna and you're sweating and 

662
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:58,441
getting really hot.
Man,

663
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,050
you're just like this.
You feel dysphoric,

664
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:02,650
like that's,
that's what's happening is dynorphins is

665
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,600
binding to the kappa opioid receptor 
will.

666
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:07,060
The really cool thing about this whole 
pathway,

667
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,780
again come to coming back to feedback.
Your biology is so smart.

668
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:14,150
It always figures out a way when you 
start to add,

669
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,570
when you start to activate that cap 
opioid receptor,

670
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,680
your body's like,
Whoa,

671
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:22,681
I'm getting a lot of this bad stuff.
I need to like make more of these 

672
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,220
receptors because I've got too much of 
this dysphoric.

673
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,460
So it actually causes more than caused 
your body to make more new opioid 

674
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,351
receptors and it makes them sensitive.
So then the next time you release 

675
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:34,351
Endorphin,
you know your workout,

676
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,200
boom,
it feels even better and it lasts.

677
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:43,410
You know?
So that's part of the reason why I know 

678
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,690
that there are certain drugs that are 
used to treat opioid addiction,

679
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,120
uh,
activate the capital you would receptor 

680
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,300
pathway exercise.
Some people use Sauna.

681
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,250
I don't think they understand the 
mechanism,

682
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:59,251
but because anything that's going to 
help you with dynorphins because people 

683
00:31:59,251 --> 00:31:59,320
that are taking opioids,
opioids,

684
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,680
opioid painkillers,
there are new opioid receptors are 

685
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:04,680
already like down,
down,

686
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,161
down.
You want it back up and dynorphins 

687
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:08,410
activating that cap,
opioid receptor will do that.

688
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,230
It's been shown in multiple studies.
You know,

689
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,120
so kinda went on a little rant there,
but it's.

690
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,910
I wanted to ask you,
I didn't want to stop you.

691
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:23,110
I'm the first one.
Go back to resveratrol and black walnut 

692
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,051
and all these different things.
Do these things work synergistically or 

693
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:29,880
do they cancel each other out or is 
there any problems and combining them?

694
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,600
Yeah.
Great.

695
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,150
That's such like,
you know,

696
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,720
so the question is synergistically would
mean,

697
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,580
can you,
can you then combine two things and have

698
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,020
an even more powerful response?
Right.

699
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Well the thing is is that because these 
compounds are targeting different 

700
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,771
pathways there,
you're going to have some overlap which 

701
00:32:50,771 --> 00:32:53,960
will have a synergistic effect,
but you're also going to have a diverse.

702
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:59,290
There's going to be diversity.
So you know you're going to have the 

703
00:32:59,290 --> 00:32:59,290
plumage and,
and the black walnuts,

704
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,430
galantamine,
and then you get your apogen and from 

705
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,430
celery,
you know,

706
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,570
apogen and causes your brain to make 
more neural neurons,

707
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:08,640
neuro stem cells,
and you get the reserve tra,

708
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,580
which is like clearing away damaged 
cells.

709
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:15,581
It's also anti-inflammatory.
And then you go and eat your Kale and 

710
00:33:15,581 --> 00:33:18,911
Broccoli.
That makes something called 

711
00:33:18,911 --> 00:33:20,110
isothiocyanates.
I isothiocyanates are um,

712
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,390
very potent anticancer.
So they actually change genes.

713
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:30,810
They change.
We have genes in our body that are able 

714
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,101
to convert a pro carcinogen into a 
carcinogen and I'm isolated 

715
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,500
isothiocyanates stop that from 
happening.

716
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:41,501
And we also have genes in our body that 
can deactivate anything that could 

717
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:42,650
potentially become a carcinogen that 
when we're exposed to all sorts of stuff

718
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:47,651
like everyday.
So activating those genes is like super 

719
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:47,651
awesome.
In fact,

720
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:52,091
it's been shown in mice if you like,
if you give mice a really high dose of 

721
00:33:52,091 --> 00:33:52,091
isothiocyanates and then you would 
knock,

722
00:33:52,091 --> 00:33:53,870
collate them,
you inject them with tumor cells,

723
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,930
they will not form tumors.
Whereas the mice that are injected.

724
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:02,110
Yes.
And there's another study that was done 

725
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,210
in humans and men,
men that took around the eight,

726
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,740
a 250 grams of Broccoli or Brussel 
sprouts.

727
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,130
So isothiocyanates or in the cruciferous
family of vegetables,

728
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,630
Kale,
Broccoli,

729
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,790
cabbage,
Brussel sprouts,

730
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,610
Bok Choy,
cauliflower,

731
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,180
yeah.

732
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,650
All that stuff.
BRASSICA.

733
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,770
Those are all.
They all have isothiocyanates in them.

734
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,980
I'm actually the isothiocyanates are 
formed.

735
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,880
They're stored in something and the 
plant called glide,

736
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:33,070
glide costs and rolaids.
And in order to release the 

737
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,150
isothiocyanates that the plants have an 
enzyme called myrosinase,

738
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:38,150
which we have a little bit of it,
a little bit in our saliva,

739
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,010
a little bit in our gut bacteria,
but not much.

740
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,740
Um,
and myrosinase is heat sensitive.

741
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:45,970
So when you heat your,
your cruciferous,

742
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,660
you're inactivating about 50 percent of 
it.

743
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:50,030
And it's still good to cook vegetables.
I mean,

744
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,670
it's good to get both,
but the raw,

745
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,800
the raw kale that you put in your 
smoothie or the raw broccoli or eating 

746
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,290
the raw broccoli,
Broccoli sprouts have seven times more 

747
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,810
because they're a young plant.
Young again comes back to that when 

748
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,811
you're younger,
the stress response is more potent 

749
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:07,811
because nature wants you to survive.

750
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:10,880
So Broccoli sprouts,
isothiocyanates or made to ward off,

751
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,430
you know,
creatures from eating them.

752
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:15,940
So the younger the plant is,
the more they make of it.

753
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,790
And so.
And so,

754
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:19,550
Broccoli sprouts,
I used to actually sprout them.

755
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Um,
have you ever tried Broccoli sprouts 

756
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:24,640
before?
I have.

757
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,090
They're pretty pungent.
Let never made them though.

758
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:31,330
It's really easy.
Like you can order some cds on Amazon 

759
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,970
and then get like this,
like this mesh bag and you put the seeds

760
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:37,560
in and then you wet the bag and you just
keep at every day.

761
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:39,690
And after about five days you'll have 
broccoli sprouts.

762
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,960
So really good on solids.
I'm not so good in smoothie.

763
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,510
I used to put them in my smoothie and 
it's like,

764
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,850
it makes me want to Barf,
like it's so gross.

765
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,130
I mean it's really good for you,
but it's just like,

766
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,480
it's so better.

767
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,230
But then again,
you know,

768
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:55,290
at that when I was doing,
I've gone through so many different.

769
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,080
I'd make different smoothies all the 
time.

770
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,000
These are disgusting.
My smoothies,

771
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,650
you'd probably Barf,
you have no idea.

772
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:05,550
I have done like Broccoli sprouts,
mustard greens,

773
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,150
garlic,
and then you know,

774
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,270
carrots and upset.
But that.

775
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,920
But that right there,
like the.

776
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,370
Have you ever tried mustard greens?
I have had mustard greens.

777
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:16,830
Have no trust in this smoothie bar.
It'll be like,

778
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,720
you'll think you're drinking hot chili 
peppers,

779
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,890
put giant chunks of ginger and four 
cloves of garlic for large cloves of 

780
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,730
garlic for that is crazy.
So garlic.

781
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,980
Alright,
let's finish the isothiocyanates,

782
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:33,120
but that it all has to do with these 
hormones in the back of my mind.

783
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:34,390
I still have another question on top of 
that.

784
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,460
Keep going.
Go,

785
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,630
go dude.
I am.

786
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,160
This is my recent obsession.

787
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,200
Is the plant this plant,
insecticides.

788
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:43,200
I really think we don't even know what's
in these plants,

789
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:48,201
but it's like,
you know these isothiocyanates men that 

790
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:48,201
ate 200,
250 grams a bit.

791
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:49,610
They actually in their urine,
you can have,

792
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:54,620
there's a biomarker of a compound that 
inactivates like a certain carcinogen 

793
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,980
that could be potential carcinogen.
And they increase that by 10 percent.

794
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:03,981
Meaning that they are doing good stuff.
Basically know the isothiocyanates are 

795
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:07,791
really good for the brain to.
It makes something called a type of 

796
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:07,791
isothiocyanate.
His soul for fame,

797
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:12,440
which is in the Broccoli sprouts.
It's been shown to like help with 

798
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,891
autism.
I mean because it induces a stress 

799
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:18,711
response in the brain and your brain 
does all this good stuff and then 

800
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:22,290
there's like apogen and and the celery.
There's a garlic.

801
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:27,470
The Allison Allison is in garlic and 
alice scene is in order to activate 

802
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,540
allison,
you have to chop or blend or two garlic.

803
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,830
So if you just throw alice,
scene itself is not sensitive to heat,

804
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,200
but if you don't,
if you don't chop up the garlic,

805
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,500
the enzymes in the garlic allison won't,
won't get activated and won't release 

806
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,230
the allison to swallow a whole clove.
Is that what you're meaning?

807
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:51,240
If you swallow a whole club or some 
people cook with whole clothes,

808
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:53,580
they don't chop them.
So if you want to,

809
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:58,670
if you're cooking with garlic,
chopped the garlic and let it sit for 

810
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,790
like five to 10 minutes before putting 
it in the heat.

811
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Really out on a cutting board.
Exactly that because that you'll get 

812
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,440
them,
you'll harvest the most.

813
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,130
Allison from allison is another one.
These plant natural plant insecticides,

814
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,980
it accentuates as time goes on.
Um,

815
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,840
so it just takes a little while for the 
enzyme to release it.

816
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:16,980
So you,
it takes a few minutes.

817
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:18,090
The enzyme release,
is it,

818
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,180
even though this plant was picked like 
maybe a week ago or a month ago or 

819
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,441
whatever has to break the rules of the 
garlic for the alice and a's to get 

820
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:29,400
released,
but more of it releases over time.

821
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,780
That seems so strange.
No,

822
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:32,990
it's not that more of it releases.
It's just that you're,

823
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,100
you have to give it time to like for the
enzymes,

824
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,230
get activated and release it.
It doesn't take that long.

825
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,570
I mean honestly if you were to wait like
five minutes,

826
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,230
you'd be fine probably,
but I'm just on the cautious side,

827
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,690
you know,
I like to wait like five or 10 minutes.

828
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,940
But yes,
if you just,

829
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:51,910
if you just chop the garlic and 
immediately it's the enzymes have to get

830
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:54,370
activated and then they chop it up and 
then the is released.

831
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:59,371
So that just,
that takes a couple of minutes and just 

832
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,181
seems odd to me that there's a process 
once it's been picked and it's sitting 

833
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:01,181
there,
it's obviously not alive anymore,

834
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,250
you know,
it's sitting in like a little bowl.

835
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,360
Yeah.
But the enzymes not active until you 

836
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,360
break the garlic's been picked,
but it's in like a club thing,

837
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,360
right?

838
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,650
You have to open it out,
you have to get it out of the club and 

839
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,040
cut the cell wall to activate these 
enzymes.

840
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,280
When I don't feel good,
I chew a whole clove of garlic taste to 

841
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,280
do that.
Yeah,

842
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,770
it is.
It's,

843
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:22,630
it's antimicrobial.
They have very,

844
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:26,290
very potent antimicrobial activities.
It kills a wide variety of bacteria.

845
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,420
When you talked about that mercer case 
that you had,

846
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,130
and I related that to everybody because 
my friend denny had a really bad case of

847
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:35,860
Murcia and I told him about your,
your situation.

848
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:39,130
He had it actually after you had been on
the podcast last time.

849
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,910
And I um,
I told him that his photos insane.

850
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:45,850
He's got a photo that I put on my 
instagram page of his knee.

851
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,720
I mean,
his,

852
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,370
his knee got within a couple of days.
It went from being like mildly infected,

853
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:52,450
like what's going on too.

854
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,210
He was in the hospital for weeks.
Massive,

855
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,770
you know,
I intravenous antibiotics.

856
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,900
The whole deal.
Yeah.

857
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,980
Awful.
I told him about what you had done with 

858
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:04,980
a grape seed extract was.
It was.

859
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,860
I should probably clarify.
I'm not exactly sure it was mrs because 

860
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,311
it wasn't actually cultured,
I assume it was because it came back 

861
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:14,311
like three times,
but.

862
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,780
So I probably one way or another.
And so I,

863
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,930
I took a very,
I was taking garlic pills like every 

864
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:22,930
hour,
grapefruit seed extract,

865
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:27,160
every app I tend to get enough is the 
garlic extract from a pill.

866
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,130
So yeah,
the question is,

867
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:30,970
um,
there's,

868
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:36,270
there's aged garlic and then there's 
just regular garlic pills and then 

869
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:38,210
there's fresh garlic.
Um,

870
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,540
it all depends if some,
some of the garlic that is aged has 

871
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,550
allison in it,
but it doesn't have other mcap in it.

872
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,800
There's other mcap tens that are doing 
other things.

873
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,380
Um,
what does the more competent mcap 10.

874
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:50,950
It's a,
it's a,

875
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:54,040
it's another byproduct of these plant.
You know,

876
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,310
insecticides and recap attends our 
first,

877
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:00,310
they,
they bind mercury very well,

878
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:03,790
so they will bind mercury and like help 
you excrete it,

879
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,060
so they bind mercury that's in your 
system and you excrete it and they also,

880
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:08,860
um,
they,

881
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:09,930
they,
uh,

882
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:15,810
do something in your brain so that they 
can actually cross over the blood brain 

883
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,571
barrier,
get into your brain and they're potent 

884
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:18,880
antioxidant in the cell membrane,
which is,

885
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:24,270
it's kind of technical,
but it's hard to find antioxidants that 

886
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,121
are in the cell membrane itself,
most of the time they're soluble in 

887
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:30,271
itself,
so it's actually very good for your 

888
00:41:30,271 --> 00:41:30,271
brain.
Um,

889
00:41:30,271 --> 00:41:34,440
but so I was taking the garlic oil,
garlic oil would have it,

890
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:37,280
should have both,
both of those.

891
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:42,790
And I was also rubbing it on my sore 
topically says rubbing it on there and 

892
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,460
taking it orally.

893
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,110
Grapes,
Grapefruit seed extract.

894
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,380
I've taken Ginkgo,
Ginkgo Biloba because that was also 

895
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,380
shown to be,
um,

896
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,180
to kill a different staphylococcus 
strains and vitamin C.

897
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,770
and I was taking this stuff like every 
hour,

898
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,910
every hour just overloading your sister 
like garlic was.

899
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,390
It was like massive garlic.
Um,

900
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,500
but the,
the,

901
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,070
the garlic itself,
you know,

902
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:09,071
it's antimicrobial,
but also there was a study that was 

903
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:10,070
recently published,
men that had like Atherosclerosis,

904
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,580
they were given two point four grams of 
garlic a day and it actually slowed the 

905
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:22,211
accumulation of plaques in their 
arteries by like 80 percent because 

906
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:25,781
allison is a very potent anti 
inflammatory and it helps the 

907
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:29,441
endothelial cells,
helps reduce inflammation that 

908
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:29,441
endothelial cells.
It's good,

909
00:42:29,441 --> 00:42:32,000
it's really good.
So Allison,

910
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,660
it just goes on and on.
I don't even know.

911
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:38,360
There's so many different compounds,
but these are just ones we know of,

912
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,160
you know,
they're just,

913
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,240
they're doing really,
really positive and potent things.

914
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,030
Curcumin is one that I've been obsessed 
with.

915
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:48,010
We going to talk about that later.
I took a lot of curcumin.

916
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,040
I take that every day.
Um,

917
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,940
I have been obsessed with a certain form
of it,

918
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,660
this formulation of it.
So I know we've talked about this before

919
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:58,130
on the podcast,
but could human,

920
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,350
there's a couple of problems with the 
bioavailability of it.

921
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,070
The first is I like your stomach acid 
and your intestines,

922
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:06,530
like you just can't get past that very 
well.

923
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:10,280
So it doesn't actually get absorbed and 
whatever does get absorbed,

924
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,690
it's like immediately cleared because 
your body's like a toxic no go away.

925
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,580
Um,
so taking,

926
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,800
taking curcumin,
which is in Tumeric,

927
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,690
right?
It's in the tumor at plant,

928
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,000
um,
that is,

929
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,210
you can be taking it but not getting a 
lot.

930
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,530
It's not doing a lot.
So.

931
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,670
So,
um,

932
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,930
there's this new formulation,
I don't know how new it is,

933
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,950
new to my mind knew to Rhonda a where 
they take the curcumin and it's put in a

934
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:41,030
fight his own,
which is sort of like a Lyposomal,

935
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,570
um,
but it's a little different to liposomes

936
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,920
contain a chemical compound like in the 
middle of it.

937
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,920
So they have like a phospho lipid kind 
of complex that contains a compound and 

938
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,330
it's supposed to increase 
bioavailability because it gets past the

939
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,720
intestinal system.
And also it can just fuse with your cell

940
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:04,721
membrane and just deliver the contents 
of the cell so it can bypass 

941
00:44:04,721 --> 00:44:04,860
transporters and all this other stuff.
Fight.

942
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:09,870
His homes are very similar.
They also have this would like this 

943
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:10,010
possible lipid complex.
In this case,

944
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:15,011
they use phosphatidylcholine,
but it also disperses the compound 

945
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:17,570
throughout and supposedly it like it's 
supposed to be more bioavailable.

946
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:22,750
I don't know if that's really true,
but I have been reading some published 

947
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,400
studies using this certain formulation 
of curcumin in the,

948
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:30,420
in a fight his own,
which is phosphatidylcholine and the 

949
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:30,770
formulation is got,
pat did a name,

950
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:33,610
it's called Meriva,
but you know,

951
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:38,930
if there is curcumin and in,
in a liposome is probably working the 

952
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:38,930
same way.

953
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:43,560
I just doubt that dispersing the 
molecules like within the actual 

954
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,990
lyposomal makes that big of a 
difference.

955
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,020
It's more about getting past.
So what this does is it gets you past 

956
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,321
the absorption issue and it also gets 
passed it because it fuses with the 

957
00:44:54,321 --> 00:44:57,390
cells quickly.
It gets past some of the other,

958
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,730
you know,
getting rid of it quickly issue.

959
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,150
But I've been taking it like I've been 
taking at least a gram a day gram a day 

960
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,080
of it.
And uh,

961
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:10,260
what got me really hooked on it was a 
couple of studies that came out,

962
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:12,270
clinical studies that were done.
Well.

963
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:14,790
First,
there was one that showed,

964
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,680
um,
people that were running downhill,

965
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,700
like exercise,
some sort of running downhill that 

966
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,760
caused delayed onset muscle soreness to 
happen.

967
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:27,750
So whatever it was about the running 
downhill caused sounding deceleration.

968
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,270
Is that what it is?
Rough.

969
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,680
You were to run a pill on your body,
on your body than running downhill is.

970
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,050
I don't know about your brain though.
Your brain's like,

971
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:37,780
oh no.
It's like,

972
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,640
no,
I'm done.

973
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,730
Yeah.
Um,

974
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,570
but it's,
it was shown to reduce the,

975
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:47,571
um,
the delayed onset muscle soreness by 

976
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:47,571
like twofold,
taking one gram,

977
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,370
one gram twice a day.
Isn't that kind of subjective though?

978
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:51,900
When you say look,
reducing soreness,

979
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:54,510
it's so hard to gauge.
It is absolutely.

980
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:57,000
That absolutely is subjective.
And same with the other.

981
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,610
There's another publication where people
were given.

982
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,920
There's not,
there's a more quantitative quantified 

983
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:04,920
publication,
but um,

984
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,450
this was,
that was done in people that had like 

985
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:09,840
osteoarthritis arthritis.
They were given one gram.

986
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,530
Um,
I think it was just one grant a day,

987
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,270
not two grams.
Think it was one gram a day and it,

988
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:20,330
it actually reduced their inflammatory 
markers by like 68 percent.

989
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:26,660
It reduced their symptoms of course,
but also there it increase their 

990
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:26,660
mobility.

991
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,420
So they checked their mobility,
increase their mobility,

992
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:29,850
blake fourfold,
so they were actually moving more,

993
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,750
you know,
and so that's the reason maybe because 

994
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,210
of the influence anti-inflammation 
properties.

995
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:40,200
Curcumin is very,
very potent antiinflammatory way more,

996
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,460
you know,
it acts very different than a typical 

997
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,991
antiinflammatories do,
but there was a study done in mice were 

998
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:51,000
mice were given like a very high dose of
not this formulation,

999
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:56,001
just regular curcumin.
They're given like 100 milligrams per 

1000
00:46:56,001 --> 00:46:56,001
kilogram body weight,
which is like insane.

1001
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,670
It's like eight,
eight grams for 180 pound male,

1002
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,220
which is a lot.
I mean it's a lot of curcumin.

1003
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,650
What does that look like in your hand?
Big Pile probably to bowl.

1004
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,480
I did see because I was kinda concerned 
about toxicity.

1005
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:16,890
I did see one study that was done on 
people that had cancer.

1006
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:22,130
They were given eight grams of curcumin 
a day for three weeks and there was no 

1007
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,410
side effects.

1008
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:23,970
I don't know.
It's a lot,

1009
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,170
it's a lot.
Uh,

1010
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:30,210
I personally think the 
phosphatidylcholine complex is a better 

1011
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,980
approach because there's only one 
proprietary formulation of that.

1012
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:37,480
I think there's an Maria Eva and there's
another one someone recently shared with

1013
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:38,110
me.
Lung,

1014
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:43,380
Lung Jebediah.
So would you recommend the standardized 

1015
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,560
stuff that you get at a regular vitamin 
store or.

1016
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,250
No,
I actually think the phosphatidylcholine

1017
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:53,251
complex is um,
is superior because of the bio 

1018
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:58,881
availability issues and because it is 
fusing with your cell membrane and 

1019
00:47:58,881 --> 00:48:00,220
getting just the biology.
I'll make sense.

1020
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:03,520
Plus there's actual studies showing that
it works and you know,

1021
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:05,830
there was another study,
so this mouse study where they gave them

1022
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:09,860
eight grams.
What the whole point of this study was,

1023
00:48:09,861 --> 00:48:11,530
was they injured the mice.
They like,

1024
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,160
they did some sort of force so far they 
put forest.

1025
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:16,150
It was so messed up.

1026
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:19,660
Now you have no idea how many of my 
killed like my,

1027
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,820
my,
my scientific career,

1028
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,990
I don't do it anymore.
I used to,

1029
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,820
I'd killed hundreds of mice in the 
vegans will come.

1030
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,210
It's for Madison harvest that I would 
have killed her.

1031
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:33,310
You're a speciesist was so awful.
Joe,

1032
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:38,500
like the awful part about this is like,
so I used to go and kill mice to get the

1033
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:40,690
organs,
so I would get their livers,

1034
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,240
which is one reason why I have a hard 
time cooking liver because I'm like,

1035
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,680
Oh God,
I wrote in liver.

1036
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,630
Oh no,
because the consistency is like the same

1037
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:48,310
as beef liver.
Um,

1038
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,500
I get their livers and thymus and 
spleen.

1039
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:54,850
But with the sad part was,
is that I had gas them so I'd go to them

1040
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,390
and uh,
as I was doing this like everyday it was

1041
00:48:58,391 --> 00:49:00,040
like,
fine and give me some ice.

1042
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,970
I'm going to guess.
And you know,

1043
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,050
I just,
I didn't care.

1044
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:04,690
I mean I was one of those,
I don't know but call it,

1045
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,810
but the thing that stirs,
here's the scary thing.

1046
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,490
First of all,
when I first started doing it,

1047
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:12,850
it was really hard and I felt really,
really bad.

1048
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,100
Like tears.
Like I was sad.

1049
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:15,670
I was,
I was like,

1050
00:49:15,671 --> 00:49:16,610
I can't do this.
Like,

1051
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,160
you know,
you're not going to get your phd.

1052
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:18,550
I'm like,
okay,

1053
00:49:18,551 --> 00:49:19,570
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

1054
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:25,350
So it was hard for me at first,
I totally got used to it where it was 

1055
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:25,600
like nothing,
like I didn't even think twice.

1056
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:30,730
I just take a handful of them,
put them in the little box and had 

1057
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,860
gasoline.
I mean it was so fucked up.

1058
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:33,940
It is.
But,

1059
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,590
and here's the other scary part is that 
then I would have long periods of time.

1060
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,520
I'm a very empathetic person that people
to like I really am just that have long 

1061
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,640
periods of time when I didn't kill the 
mice and then I'd have to go back there.

1062
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:52,641
So like months would go by and then I 
have to go back and do it and all of a 

1063
00:49:52,641 --> 00:49:54,400
sudden I was like I can't do this.
And I couldn't watch them.

1064
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:56,500
They'd start breathing,
you know,

1065
00:49:56,501 --> 00:50:01,501
and trying to gasp for air and I just 
felt awful and so I'm just glad I don't 

1066
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:02,980
do that anymore.
I moved onto humans,

1067
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,630
take their blood,
take their blood,

1068
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:06,580
but the,
it's better for them that way.

1069
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,420
It's better.
Yeah.

1070
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:08,940
You're helping them.
Yeah.

1071
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,880
So,
you know,

1072
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,020
the,
the mouse stuff,

1073
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:11,560
man,
it was,

1074
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:15,360
there was you like when you have to do 
something and you know,

1075
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,800
I was medical science doing cancer 
research.

1076
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:22,250
I wasn't just doing it for fun,
but it was definitely um,

1077
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,200
is strange feeling to like feel that 
desensitized sensitizer I'm like,

1078
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:27,690
Whoa,
wait,

1079
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,690
and I've been doing this for like four 
years.

1080
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:31,370
Why am I all and caring about this 
again?

1081
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,500
Just take a little break.
Yeah.

1082
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:36,950
Because I was doing other experiments 
that didn't require that I had to kill,

1083
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,080
kill mice and get their liver.
But.

1084
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,360
So would you recommend taking regular 
curcumin that you get from a regular 

1085
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:47,850
vitamin store or do you think there's 
some benefit of it?

1086
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,190
Yeah,
absolutely.

1087
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,210
But it's just not as much as much 
because first of all,

1088
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:54,590
you're not going to absorb as much of 
it.

1089
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,260
And second of all you're going to,
you know,

1090
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,310
clear it away quickly.
Um,

1091
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,480
but what is there a better formula of 
resveratrol?

1092
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,690
Resveratrol?
Supposedly there's some of it in wine 

1093
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,551
which they were trying to correlate with
the positive health benefits of drinking

1094
00:51:10,621 --> 00:51:13,320
glass of wine a day.
But as far as I understand,

1095
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,250
it's a small amount.

1096
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,100
Yeah.
So if five ounce glass of wine has about

1097
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:21,910
two milligrams of Risperdal,
which if you're talking about this study

1098
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:24,730
I talked about in monkeys,
they were given like 480 milligrams.

1099
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,310
That's,
you know,

1100
00:51:26,311 --> 00:51:28,570
you're not gonna like monkey.
You're not gonna yeah.

1101
00:51:28,571 --> 00:51:30,130
For a monkey and you're not going to 
like.

1102
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,050
So you're not going to like have that 
same effect.

1103
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:37,051
And like I said,
they're a thousand milligrams was for 

1104
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:37,051
the clearing of the topic,
clearing away damaged cells.

1105
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:38,290
But you know,
these are,

1106
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,540
these are a little chemical,
these are,

1107
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:44,580
these are chemical compounds that are 
triggering something in our body and 

1108
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,300
whether it's two milligrams or 400 
milligrams,

1109
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,160
it's doing a little bit of something.
And so,

1110
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,680
you know,
I wouldn't just throw my nose up.

1111
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,560
I mean you're not going to like live 30 
percent longer because of it,

1112
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,800
because you drink wine,
you know,

1113
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,910
but it's still,
you're still getting some,

1114
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,520
you know.
So there's something to that.

1115
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,050
There is,
there is something,

1116
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:02,670
but it's not

1117
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,850
grocery store.
He was drinking a box of one.

1118
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,150
He drank a box of wine at night,
which they think is like eight bottles.

1119
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,950
How did he not like die of alcohol?
Some people have like a weird.

1120
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,980
They have a variation in their gene 
where they're able to actually convert 

1121
00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:22,140
the alcohol to acetone and Acetate,
which is ketone.

1122
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:26,040
So they actually get benefits from.
It's really interesting.

1123
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,550
Yeah.
Whoa.

1124
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,250
Yeah.
I don't know.

1125
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,040
I know.
Well clearly he's got something if you 

1126
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:34,040
can drink that much wine and not.

1127
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:37,440
When he was telling us he was chocking 
it off like it was no big deal and we're

1128
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:38,010
all like,
wait,

1129
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:39,240
what,
what the fuck?

1130
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,540
Like a whole box.
Like even Brian was like a box,

1131
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,380
a box,
a box of wine,

1132
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,590
like a box of wine.
It's for like a large family gathering,

1133
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,960
you know,
alcohol in high,

1134
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,620
high doses like that.
It's not good.

1135
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:58,870
You can know it.
You're going to start killing neurons 

1136
00:52:58,870 --> 00:52:59,260
here.
It's not good.

1137
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:01,690
You shouldn't do the binge where you're 
taking so much of it.

1138
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:03,820
But having a five ounce glass of wine 
with,

1139
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,960
you know,
two milligrams and resveratrol may not 

1140
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:08,960
be as bad it,
it's probably probably

1141
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,680
some health benefit as well to this.
The mood altering shift of the relaxing,

1142
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:18,870
of having a glass of wine.
I've always felt like that's something 

1143
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:22,681
that we shouldn't really look past.
Like having a drink relaxes you and just

1144
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:28,290
whatever negative,
negative impact that alcohol has on your

1145
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:33,291
liver or the toxicity,
isn't it kind of balanced out at least 

1146
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:38,150
on in low doses by the positive benefit 
that you get from it being a social 

1147
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:40,110
lubricant,
relaxing you,

1148
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,040
things along those lines.

1149
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,130
It makes sense to me.
I mean there,

1150
00:53:43,131 --> 00:53:48,131
there are so many different conflicting 
studies out there with alcohol that's 

1151
00:53:48,131 --> 00:53:48,131
good for you.
It's bad,

1152
00:53:48,131 --> 00:53:48,140
it's good,
you know,

1153
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:53,141
and,
and I think it has a lot to do with 

1154
00:53:53,141 --> 00:53:55,000
genetics and just binge or what else are
you eating and just all these other 

1155
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,000
things.
But yeah,

1156
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,420
if,
if someone drinks a glass of wine,

1157
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,520
let's say they're like wound up all the 
time.

1158
00:53:58,521 --> 00:54:00,770
It's like we were talking about before 
the podcast,

1159
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,530
but they're always like the lions coming
to get me,

1160
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,350
you know,
it's like,

1161
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,380
you know,
the lions coming to get me.

1162
00:54:06,381 --> 00:54:09,680
I gotta run.
I gotta fight off this beast.

1163
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,390
I mean that's the stress response,
right?

1164
00:54:11,391 --> 00:54:16,391
That's the,
you're activating your sympathetic 

1165
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:16,391
nervous system,
but you know,

1166
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:18,620
which is good if you're actually out in 
Africa and there's a line,

1167
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:22,290
but if you're not having that active all
the time is actually it,

1168
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,480
it,
it prevents some of the feedback loops 

1169
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:27,480
that happen in your brain.

1170
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,640
So when you have chronic stress like 
that,

1171
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,310
then you start to,
you start to keep making it.

1172
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,070
Usually when you're making,
when you make stress hormone,

1173
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:34,730
your body's like,
oh,

1174
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:35,600
I made this.
That's enough.

1175
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,260
It shuts it off so that stuff that goes 
away so you no longer shut it off and it

1176
00:54:39,261 --> 00:54:44,261
just keeps going.
And that can cause you to either be 

1177
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:46,871
super anxious where you're like lions 
there all the time or the opposite end 

1178
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:47,750
of the spectrum where you're like,
totally,

1179
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:52,370
you just don't care about anything.
You know,

1180
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:54,110
and,
and you can be like depressed.

1181
00:54:54,111 --> 00:54:56,210
Where it's like nothing excites you,
you know,

1182
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,830
you're just,
you're indifferent.

1183
00:54:57,831 --> 00:55:02,831
So having a glass of wine,
if that chills you out and you're not 

1184
00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:02,920
saying,
you know,

1185
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:04,610
I,
I think that seems like,

1186
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,440
you know,
okay,

1187
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:09,560
if you're having a glass of wine to 
chill out and yeah,

1188
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:14,561
it seems like she'll announce good,
but exercise would probably be a better 

1189
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:14,561
way to do it.

1190
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:14,561
Yeah.
What about the,

1191
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,670
is there any benefit to stressing your 
body through alcohol?

1192
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:20,880
Like as you were talking about these 
pesticides that plants produce,

1193
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:21,720
their stress,
your body,

1194
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:24,420
you have this response from exercise,
things along those lines.

1195
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,840
Is there a risk?
When I was young I was really dumb.

1196
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:32,700
I thought that smoking cigarettes might 
have a good effect on your lungs because

1197
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:35,460
it's like lifting way through your lungs
because your lungs would be like,

1198
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:37,500
ah,
I got to process this stuff and it would

1199
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,060
make your lungs stronger.
Like,

1200
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:44,061
wasn't that.
I think that was like what doctors 

1201
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:44,061
believed,
like,

1202
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:45,450
yeah.
Well at one point in time,

1203
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,720
I mean I know that it was in that movie,
the aviator,

1204
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:51,180
the Leonardo Dicaprio moving.
That's good.

1205
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:51,440
No,
no,

1206
00:55:51,441 --> 00:55:52,710
no.
That's not the one I'm thinking about.

1207
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:57,140
I'm thinking of the one where he was a 
can.

1208
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,710
No,
no,

1209
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,480
no where he played.
Um,

1210
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:07,040
I'm the asshole that,
that ran the FBI,

1211
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,790
the guy who wore dresses over.
Yeah.

1212
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,740
Your hoover when he played j Edgar 
Hoover when he was young.

1213
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,480
Only Rod Caprio,
uh,

1214
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:18,750
in the scene was with his mom and his 
mom was telling him,

1215
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:23,990
you know,
that you're frail and you should listen 

1216
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:23,990
to the doctrine,
smoke cigarettes.

1217
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,010
Like that was the thing

1218
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:29,010
that they used to doctors prescribed 
cigarettes to people to like increase 

1219
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,600
their vitality.
Well,

1220
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,060
I don't know about.
I mean,

1221
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:36,070
I don't know what their explanation was,
but we'll do contain nicotine.

1222
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:36,910
I don't,
I know you want to,

1223
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:41,940
I don't want to interrupt,
but there is one thing that absolutely 

1224
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,311
does happen from smoking cigarettes that
does benefit a certain population of 

1225
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:46,240
people because when you,
when you put nicotine in your body,

1226
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,620
um,
it,

1227
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,190
it totally normalizes something called 
sensory gating,

1228
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:56,460
which is what your brain does.
Your sensory gating is your brain 

1229
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,570
filtering out all this other information
information that's happening all the 

1230
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:01,030
time.
Like Jamie's sitting over there,

1231
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:01,960
he's doing,
God knows what,

1232
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:06,961
but I don't care.
I'm not paying attention because I'm 

1233
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:06,961
talking to you,
you know,

1234
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:07,450
there's noises out here,
there's smells,

1235
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:09,400
there's,
so it's like your brain is able to focus

1236
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:13,210
in and not like keep all these inputs 
coming at once.

1237
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,550
Well there are people that have,
you know,

1238
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,190
problems in sensory gating and it's 
genetically related.

1239
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:19,990
It's also,
there's certain dietary factors that can

1240
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:24,991
play a role where they cannot do that.
And so they're getting all this input 

1241
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:29,941
all the time from everywhere.
So if they like walk into a room with 

1242
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:29,941
like a bunch of people,
they flip out.

1243
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:34,501
It's like,
because it's just so they can hear all 

1244
00:57:34,501 --> 00:57:34,501
the conversation.
It's all coming in at once.

1245
00:57:34,501 --> 00:57:38,490
It's like sensory overload.
So a cigarette can negate nicotine 

1246
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,761
negates it for 15 minutes,
which is why some people probably are 

1247
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:41,761
chronically smoking because after 15 
minutes,

1248
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:42,760
man,
they got to get that hit again.

1249
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:44,020
Or you know,
it's coming.

1250
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,630
A lot of people that are,
um,

1251
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,180
schizophrenia have a sensory gating 
issue.

1252
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,300
And so a lot of schizophrenia is 
actually,

1253
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:52,540
I think,
I think I'm,

1254
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,760
this is me totally just throwing this 
out there.

1255
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,760
I think that's likely why a lot of 
schizophrenia,

1256
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,350
expert chainsmokers because they're self
medicating.

1257
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,670
That makes sense.
But I don't know,

1258
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:01,510
I'm just,
that's,

1259
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,000
that's my point.
We're talking about nicotine though.

1260
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:05,920
You're not talking about the actual act 
of smoking.

1261
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,620
Nicotine.
You could take that and other forums and

1262
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:13,750
nicotine is prescribe.
It wasn't prescribed a certain heart 

1263
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,591
patients.
So he doesn't have some sort of a 

1264
00:58:16,591 --> 00:58:16,591
benefit.
I don't know the heart function.

1265
00:58:16,591 --> 00:58:17,230
I don't know.
I feel like it does.

1266
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,890
I feel like there's some sort of a 
medicinal benefit to nicotine itself.

1267
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:25,891
Obviously not in a cigarette for him.
See if he could find that health 

1268
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:27,110
benefits of nicotine.
Yeah.

1269
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,210
But Mike dumb idea was that it was like 
it would stress out your lungs,

1270
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:32,980
it would make your lungs stronger.
Definitely stress them out.

1271
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,160
But is there any benefit like that with 
alcohol?

1272
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:39,580
Like is there any like stressing out 
your body from drinking?

1273
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:43,540
Is there any robustness that would be a 
side effect of that.

1274
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:48,280
So here's the thing with anything that's
Hormetic,

1275
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:53,050
so anything that is a,
the dose is very important.

1276
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:58,410
You know,
when you have something that is 

1277
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:58,410
stressful on the body.
If you were to be running,

1278
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,830
if you were to run all the time,
all day,

1279
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:01,210
every day,
you didn't recover,

1280
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:03,000
you die.
You know,

1281
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:08,060
if you're a,
if you were to sit in the sauna or a 

1282
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,021
cold or you know,
so if you were to take like two 

1283
00:59:10,021 --> 00:59:11,220
kilograms of Bok Choy,
you know,

1284
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,060
you'd have some problems.
It's too much.

1285
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,330
The things that are hormetic,
two kilograms of Bok Choy would fuck you

1286
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:18,560
up.
There's like woman pounds of Bok Choy,

1287
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,920
two kilograms is kilograms.
That's a lot of

1288
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,090
Bok Choy.
Yeah.

1289
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:24,620
What does that look like?
That a lot?

1290
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,400
Well,
a kilogram is one point two pounds.

1291
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:30,640
Is that what it is?
I don't know.

1292
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,670
Jamie.
Good goal.

1293
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,690
I think it's one point.
Two pounds.

1294
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,590
It sounds familiar.
So two kilograms,

1295
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,980
two kilograms says it's about a box box,
box box box of what?

1296
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,330
Above?
Like a big box.

1297
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,350
I started looking at,
well that's a,

1298
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,440
that's not a real measurement.
I don't know what a box to box you in 

1299
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,460
this room that doesn't make any sense,
but what does a kilogram.

1300
00:59:52,461 --> 00:59:54,320
A kilogram is one point,
two pounds,

1301
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:56,330
right?
Or two point two pounds.

1302
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,720
Is it two point two,
two point two,

1303
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,680
two point two pounds per.
So four kilograms.

1304
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,640
Eight point was at a point eight,
nine pounds of Bok Choy.

1305
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,860
What is just google that?
What does that look like?

1306
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:14,950
Yeah.
Google four kilograms kilograms to 

1307
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:18,191
pounds,
four kilograms or pounds people in 

1308
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:18,191
Europe.

1309
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:19,390
You fucking idiot.
You don't even know the metric system.

1310
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,550
You don't even know what the rest of 
them.

1311
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:26,551
You know what this is my response.
Is that Google for things like that?

1312
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:32,380
Yeah.
It's hard to get even with my stupid 

1313
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:32,980
brain.
So that will kill you.

1314
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:38,380
I'll kill you,
but it might give you greater goiter 

1315
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:38,520
like,
like it because,

1316
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:39,550
um,
what does goiter?

1317
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:42,900
It could basically cause hyperthyroid.
Whoa.

1318
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:43,930
Yeah.
Really?

1319
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,310
Yes.
That's crazy.

1320
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:49,180
Well,
the thing about the isothiocyanates,

1321
01:00:49,181 --> 01:00:51,850
which are in Bok Choy,
is that they're anticancer.

1322
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,380
They're good when you're,
when you're getting,

1323
01:00:53,381 --> 01:00:56,950
when you're eating your Kale.
And I'm talking to kilograms again,

1324
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,510
it took two.
That's a lot.

1325
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,810
Massive amount,
massive.

1326
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,920
Nobody in their right mind would ever 
eat that much kale or Broccoli or 

1327
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,530
whatever.
Bok Choy a day.

1328
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,870
But if you did,
the thing is,

1329
01:01:07,871 --> 01:01:12,871
is that isothiocyanates can compete with
iodine transport into the thyroid.

1330
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:16,480
And so if all you're eating all day,
everyday is Bok Choy,

1331
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,990
guess what?
Your iodine.

1332
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:19,360
It's not going to be getting into your 
thyroid.

1333
01:01:19,361 --> 01:01:20,910
And so you could have some thyroid 
problems,

1334
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,540
right?
So you need,

1335
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,950
that's just overwhelming the amount.
And this is,

1336
01:01:23,951 --> 01:01:26,950
and this is with anything hormetic I am 
going to answer your question,

1337
01:01:26,951 --> 01:01:31,951
but the point that I'm trying to make is
that a lot of these compounds that are 

1338
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:35,500
hormetic fasting exercise,
you know,

1339
01:01:35,501 --> 01:01:37,150
doing cold stress,
heat stress,

1340
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,740
these plant insecticides you need the,
the key is the dose.

1341
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:44,350
So like you don't want to over it.
You don't want to have a huge,

1342
01:01:44,351 --> 01:01:45,710
huge dose of it,
you know.

1343
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:48,190
And with the plants it's really hard to 
get a huge dose.

1344
01:01:48,191 --> 01:01:49,480
But with exercise,
you know,

1345
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:55,290
I'm not,
I'm not sure that running 50 miles is 

1346
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:55,290
actually that good.
It's pretty,

1347
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:55,930
it's pretty stressful.

1348
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,580
It's not good.
Yeah.

1349
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,200
So you know,
you get the point.

1350
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:03,210
But with alcohol it has been shown that 
in small doses it can have a slight 

1351
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:08,020
hormetic effect in small doses.
Well it depends.

1352
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:13,050
Like,
I don't know if these studies have been 

1353
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:13,050
done in humans yet,
but like probably like,

1354
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:13,050
you know,
like a,

1355
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:16,940
like a small glass of wine,
there is a slightly hormetic effect now.

1356
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:21,030
Now keep in mind there are other things 
that can regulate that,

1357
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:22,890
you know,
people are different.

1358
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:25,470
We all have different genes and so for 
example,

1359
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:31,040
I cannot recover from a large dose of 
alcohol like Dan Ken because my,

1360
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:38,270
I have a certain gene variation and a 
gene that does not repair damage from 

1361
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,040
two neurons very well,
you know,

1362
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,090
so there are other things to keep in 
mind,

1363
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:45,210
but yes,
that has been shown in small doses,

1364
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:50,420
at least in animal models like flies,
more arms that small dose of alcohol can

1365
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:55,641
actually have a hormetic effect.
And that's with any class to actually 

1366
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:57,220
define a chemical compound as hormetic.
The,

1367
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,410
the,
the in science,

1368
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,330
the definition is like there's this,
there's a u shaped curve,

1369
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:06,240
so when you have just enough of it,
you get a positive effect,

1370
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:11,241
but when you go over that threshold you 
start to have a negative effect and 

1371
01:03:11,241 --> 01:03:11,700
that's,
that's with,

1372
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,580
that's what stress,
when we're talking about good stress,

1373
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:19,581
we're talking about,
we're not talking about exercising all 

1374
01:03:19,581 --> 01:03:19,581
day,
every day.

1375
01:03:19,581 --> 01:03:19,740
We're talking about exercising,
you know,

1376
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:20,520
getting,
you know,

1377
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,320
pushing past and in getting some of that

1378
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:28,150
huge issue with martial artists,
with the fighters because they always 

1379
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:31,121
feel like if they do more they will have
more endurance and there'll be able to 

1380
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:35,741
perform better inside the octagon or 
inside the ring or whatever they're 

1381
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,390
wrestling mat,
whatever the competing on and it becomes

1382
01:03:38,391 --> 01:03:43,391
a real issue with people because 
overtraining is a giant factor in 

1383
01:03:43,391 --> 01:03:47,711
preparation because they get to the 
point where the body can't recover from 

1384
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,170
the work that it's done and their mind 
and their,

1385
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:54,220
their actual,
their mental toughness and their 

1386
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:54,220
discipline has actually ruined them 
because they've,

1387
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:56,420
they've gone too far.
They started getting chronic injuries to

1388
01:03:56,421 --> 01:03:59,390
big issue right now.
So there's that tipping point we have to

1389
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:04,391
realize like what is the right amount of
work for and the right amount of 

1390
01:04:04,391 --> 01:04:07,190
recovery versus people who they feel 
like,

1391
01:04:07,191 --> 01:04:09,440
well,
if you just push yourself further,

1392
01:04:09,441 --> 01:04:11,420
your body will respond.
If you put.

1393
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,440
There's.
There's a lot of people that have had 

1394
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:16,440
that attitude that if you can just,
it'll be hard.

1395
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:16,940
You might feel overtrained the 
beginning,

1396
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:18,530
but your body will compensate.
You.

1397
01:04:18,531 --> 01:04:21,980
Body will eventually upregulate and get 
ready.

1398
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,350
Get ready for this increased workload.

1399
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,710
The manning on it.
Yeah,

1400
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:26,810
prepare for war.
Well,

1401
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:28,180
I mean there's some truth to that.
You know,

1402
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,650
you do want to push yourself and your 
body will,

1403
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:35,270
you will have a strong stress response,
but you have to recover.

1404
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,650
You can't,
you can't,

1405
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,660
you can't.
If you.

1406
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,580
The dose is very important.
So if you push yourself beyond,

1407
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:44,390
it's just like you're not going to have 
a recovery period,

1408
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,340
like you're not going to be able to.
Isn't it

1409
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:51,040
important than to build your base over a
long period of time then?

1410
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:56,070
Because you would build your endurance 
slowly where you slowly increase the 

1411
01:04:56,070 --> 01:05:00,121
base.
You make sure that your recovery is 

1412
01:05:00,121 --> 01:05:02,311
consistent and then just keep doing it,
monitoring it over a long period of 

1413
01:05:02,311 --> 01:05:03,760
time.
Then once you have a very high base,

1414
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:06,100
then really ramp it up and then go 
through like a

1415
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,000
training camp.
That makes sense.

1416
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,650
Yeah.
Nobody does that though.

1417
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,150
That makes sense.
I mean,

1418
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:12,350
that would,
that makes logical,

1419
01:05:12,351 --> 01:05:14,120
that makes sense.
And,

1420
01:05:14,121 --> 01:05:14,630
and,
and,

1421
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,460
and even for some of these,
these uh,

1422
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,520
plant,
you know,

1423
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,320
compounds to like in that Rivera trial 
setting,

1424
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:25,321
the monkeys,
the first year those monkeys were 

1425
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:28,441
actually given us a smaller dose.
They're giving 80 milligrams for the 

1426
01:05:28,441 --> 01:05:28,441
first year and the second year they were
given $400.

1427
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:29,770
Very interesting.
Right?

1428
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,180
They started and,
and back to your resveratrol.

1429
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:35,080
I don't,
I don't like I have to.

1430
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:40,110
There's so many compounds.
There's so many brands out there that 

1431
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:40,430
are just utter crap.
They have like filler and you know,

1432
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,460
you think you're getting Akinesia but 
you're not,

1433
01:05:42,461 --> 01:05:47,461
you're getting some,
some kind of magnesium steroids or 

1434
01:05:47,461 --> 01:05:47,461
something.
So I'm,

1435
01:05:47,461 --> 01:05:48,510
I'm,
I'm interested in the,

1436
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:53,511
is virtual.
I'm interested in a lot of these other 

1437
01:05:53,511 --> 01:05:53,511
plant compounds.

1438
01:05:53,511 --> 01:05:55,830
I like to get,
it's one of the reasons why I like to 

1439
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:55,830
eat a wide variety of plants.
You know,

1440
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:56,350
celery,
Parsley,

1441
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:57,430
you know there's,
oh,

1442
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:00,090
there's stuff in like apple peels and in
green tomatoes,

1443
01:06:00,091 --> 01:06:03,970
so ursolic acid in apple,
skin and tomato dean and green tomatoes.

1444
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,780
They actually inhibited gene in your 
skeletal muscle called atf four.

1445
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:13,080
That gene actually starts.
It prevents protein synthesis from 

1446
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,380
happening,
so it stops your muscle cells for making

1447
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:19,381
proteins.
So inhibiting that means more protein 

1448
01:06:19,381 --> 01:06:20,170
synthesis and that's been shown in mice,
like if they're giving really high dose,

1449
01:06:20,171 --> 01:06:25,171
like point two,
seven percent are solocasts and point 

1450
01:06:25,171 --> 01:06:27,441
zero,
five percent tomatoes and they can grow 

1451
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:27,441
that,
increase our muscle growth by 30 percent

1452
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:29,530
over what they would do if they didn't 
have it.

1453
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,580
That's insane.
Yeah,

1454
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,140
but they were giving them a huge dose 
still.

1455
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:35,290
That's amazing.
It's amazing.

1456
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,120
Thirty percent is like,
that's.

1457
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,660
Steroids can do that.
Yeah.

1458
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,720
Well there's these,
these are now out in the market as,

1459
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,330
as far,
you know,

1460
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:46,360
foreign nutraceuticals,
I guess you'd call them muscle builders.

1461
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,690
They're all into it,
but the,

1462
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,760
you know,
but you can eat.

1463
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:50,530
I like to eat apples.
I like to,

1464
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,110
I like to make,
um,

1465
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,770
actually I don't make it.
I buy it already made,

1466
01:06:53,771 --> 01:06:57,100
but it's to tomatillo sauce.
Have you ever tried that?

1467
01:06:57,330 --> 01:07:02,050
It's really good on eggs and put them on
eggs and every time I'm drunk I'm eating

1468
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:02,380
it.
I'm like,

1469
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:03,250
ah,
missiles,

1470
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,110
muscles.
How bizarre.

1471
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:10,560
Um,
is rose virtual something you should 

1472
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:10,560
take with food?
Empty stomach.

1473
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,300
How should you take that?
You know,

1474
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,010
because I've been so skeptical of the 
field for so long,

1475
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:17,140
I've not supplemented with it.
I mean,

1476
01:07:17,141 --> 01:07:18,900
I did for a little while.
Um,

1477
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,270
I'm looking back into it just because 
now I'm interested.

1478
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,730
Now I'm very interested.
I,

1479
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:24,790
I,
there's,

1480
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,850
there's also someone pointed out to me 
because I,

1481
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:31,910
um,
I did a post on this and they said that 

1482
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:33,841
was vera trawl was shown to negate some 
of the high intensity interval training 

1483
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,900
gains or something.
I didn't read the study.

1484
01:07:37,901 --> 01:07:39,530
I don't know exactly what that means,
but I'm.

1485
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:44,580
Brisbane all has been shown to actually 
cause a mitochondrial biogenesis and 

1486
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:48,970
shift muscle fibers to type one which 
are more endurance.

1487
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:51,910
The thing is that Raspberry Charles,
not like an antioxidant,

1488
01:07:51,911 --> 01:07:56,911
it's not like taking vitamin E,
the difference between taking an 

1489
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:58,600
antioxidant or to even taking like 
Ibuprofen,

1490
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:03,630
like if you do these studies,
studies have been done where they've 

1491
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,100
shown that taking like Ibuprofen or 
taking supplemental vitamin A,

1492
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:10,340
you know,
after a workout or while you're working 

1493
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:10,450
out can blend some of the positive 
benefits from it.

1494
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:14,320
And the reason is because when you 
exercise you are,

1495
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,100
you know,
you're causing stress.

1496
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:21,110
Like we were talked about,
talked about you're causing 

1497
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,110
inflammation,
you're causing,

1498
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:23,960
you know,
reactive oxygen species to form and this

1499
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:26,240
is very important for the stress 
response.

1500
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:28,130
That's,
that's why you have a positive effect.

1501
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,080
But if you're taking something like 
vitamin D,

1502
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:34,320
vitamin e actually like it's like a 
sponge it like goes around and stuff and

1503
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:34,700
he's like,
oh,

1504
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:38,300
here's a reactive oxygen species or an 
inflammatory that just stops.

1505
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:41,660
It sucks it up.
And ensades,

1506
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:42,470
you know,
they,

1507
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:47,530
they,
they stopped the inflammatory mediators 

1508
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:47,730
from being produced,
revere,

1509
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,370
trawl,
curcumin,

1510
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,990
you know,
these plant insecticides,

1511
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:56,350
they don't work that way.
They actually are stressful themselves 

1512
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:58,190
and so they activate these anti 
inflammatory genes,

1513
01:08:58,191 --> 01:09:00,020
antioxidant genes,
all this good stuff.

1514
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,090
So it's a very different,
you know,

1515
01:09:02,091 --> 01:09:04,900
then then taking,
um,

1516
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:10,560
an and an antioxidant or an anti 
inflammatory and implement those nsaids 

1517
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,350
or they're not really good news in my 
opinion,

1518
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,800
they're,
they've been shown to increase heart 

1519
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,631
attack,
heart attack and has been shown and say 

1520
01:09:20,631 --> 01:09:20,631
it's.

1521
01:09:20,631 --> 01:09:22,870
And so if there's an FDA warning label 
on every Ibuprofen bottle and all that,

1522
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,190
you can buy in the market.
So that's bad for you.

1523
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:26,680
So,
well,

1524
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:28,310
it's nonsteroidal,
anti inflammatory,

1525
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,930
right?
Yeah,

1526
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:31,580
it's Ibuprofen.
Yeah.

1527
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,500
The thing,
the thing with some of these,

1528
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,740
it depends on the type of,
of um,

1529
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,270
and said,
but with,

1530
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:42,290
with Ibuprofen and other ones.
So ibuprofen targets.

1531
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:47,590
The way it's an antiinflammatory is it 
targets one of these enzymes called Cox 

1532
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:51,710
two and it stops Cox two makes inflammed
it makes leukotrienes,

1533
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:55,520
and excuse me,
trump thromboxanes,

1534
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,640
which caused platelets to aggregate.
They also cause inflammation.

1535
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,310
It makes this other chemical that's 
involved in pain.

1536
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:04,280
So when you stop that enzyme from doing 
that,

1537
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,200
then you're going to have less 
inflammation.

1538
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:08,300
You're going to have an inflammation 
causes pain,

1539
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,230
right?
So,

1540
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:14,370
so you're going to have an anti pain 
believing that you're going to have a 

1541
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:14,370
pain relieving effect.

1542
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:16,790
The problem is,
is that when you inhibit,

1543
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:21,791
again,
we get back to biology and feedback 

1544
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:21,791
loops and you know,
our,

1545
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:22,250
our biology,
we've,

1546
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,090
even though this enzyme,
Cox two causes inflammation,

1547
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,870
it's also an anti inflammatory at the 
same time,

1548
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,770
Cox to also,
it's important for making sure platelets

1549
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:38,090
don't aggregate too much.
So at the same time it's doing something

1550
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:39,350
that's making them migrate.
It's also like,

1551
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:44,351
okay,
let's keep this in check and let's make 

1552
01:10:44,351 --> 01:10:44,351
sure it doesn't go overboard and it also
makes something else,

1553
01:10:44,351 --> 01:10:46,310
um,
that's important for relaxing,

1554
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:51,311
smooth,
smooth the smooth muscle cells in your 

1555
01:10:51,311 --> 01:10:51,330
blood vessels.
Um,

1556
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:56,410
and also it releases nitric oxide.
So when you spoke that enzyme to 

1557
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:58,400
blocking the inflammation and pain,
but then the,

1558
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:01,340
um,
the smooth muscle cells become stiff and

1559
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:02,720
you make less nitrogen oxide.
So,

1560
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:05,240
which is important to relax the blood 
vessels.

1561
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:06,770
And that can be bad.

1562
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:11,150
If you are a stiffening your vessels a 
lot and you have plaques,

1563
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:12,210
the plaques can then,
you know,

1564
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:17,230
kind of come off and get clogged and you
have a friend who takes that shit every 

1565
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:17,340
morning.
He'd runs a lot,

1566
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,520
he runs a lot and he takes it every 
morning and he'll take it before he 

1567
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,190
runs.
So he probably,

1568
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,120
oh,
that's not.

1569
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:29,240
First of all,
I'll send you this study where at 

1570
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:29,310
blended the gains from exercise.
Like it really is new.

1571
01:11:29,311 --> 01:11:32,070
Cameron hanes get off that shit.
I mean women.

1572
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:37,250
So there was like eight different 
clinical trials that were done and this 

1573
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:41,721
is what made the FDA put a warning label
on all ibuprofen bottles is because 

1574
01:11:41,721 --> 01:11:43,290
chronic use increased the risk of stroke
and heart attack twofold.

1575
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,400
And the,
and the Mecca,

1576
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,860
there was a study that was published a 
few months ago,

1577
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,900
um,
that was done in animals that showed the

1578
01:11:48,901 --> 01:11:49,510
mechanisms.

1579
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:52,610
So it showed exactly what was wrong with
inhibiting Cox to,

1580
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:57,940
um,
I've been very concerned because I know 

1581
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,090
that like almost every female that I 
know takes it once a month,

1582
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:05,120
they'll take it once a month is a,
if you're chronically taking it every 

1583
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:07,380
month,
you're taking it for a week,

1584
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,840
one week out of every month and you're 
taking it every month.

1585
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:14,990
So really it should be reserved for a 
pretty significant injury where you are 

1586
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:16,530
in real pain in my opinion.
Look,

1587
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:21,531
I don't know,
maybe taking it one week out of them it 

1588
01:12:21,531 --> 01:12:21,590
chronic use in this wasn't,
this was done in,

1589
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:26,750
you know,
there's eight different clinical 

1590
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:26,750
studies.
Chronic use.

1591
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:26,750
To me,
chronic use is taking it every month.

1592
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,730
So once a month would be.
I mean it.

1593
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:34,680
So if you get so drunk that you're 
fucked up and you're hung over and 

1594
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,310
wrecked once a month,
that's chronic use.

1595
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:38,170
Then people take that for hangover.

1596
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:39,120
Yeah.
I don't know if you're,

1597
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:40,590
if you're,
if you're getting ripped,

1598
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:45,620
if you're,
if you're drinking a lot of alcohol 

1599
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:45,620
going,
would you consider that chronic use?

1600
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:51,810
So most people wouldn't.
Most people think chronic users like 

1601
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:52,230
every weekend,
so once a month is enough that you don't

1602
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:54,160
have enough time to recover from the 
damage,

1603
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:59,161
is that what you're saying?
I think that once a month if you going 

1604
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:00,180
overboard like that to me.
Um,

1605
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:00,780
I,
I,

1606
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:01,560
I,
you know,

1607
01:13:01,561 --> 01:13:03,570
I don't really have any evidence that 
once a month.

1608
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:05,860
In fact,
I know there have been some studies that

1609
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:10,861
have to look into that.
I would think that going out and binge 

1610
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:11,010
drinking once a month is probably not 
the best thing.

1611
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:16,450
You know,
you can handle it more when you're 

1612
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:17,631
younger,
but especially as you get older are our 

1613
01:13:17,631 --> 01:13:19,710
capacities to handle that type of stress
or decreased,

1614
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,690
you know.
So to me,

1615
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:23,970
especially as you're getting older,
you're probably not,

1616
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:25,770
you're probably doing more damage by 
doing that.

1617
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:30,790
What I was getting at,
would you be as concerned with someone 

1618
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,130
taking your Ibuprofen once a month as 
you would be someone binge drinking once

1619
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:32,130
a month?

1620
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:38,760
I am concerned about Ibuprofen but,
but I don't know.

1621
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,200
I don't.
I don't know actually.

1622
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:43,920
I've never heard anybody talk about 
negative effects of Ibuprofen,

1623
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:49,300
Ibuprofen.
I'm the selective Cox two inhibitors or 

1624
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:49,300
even worse,
which are,

1625
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,640
I don't know the brand names for them.
Cox,

1626
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:54,930
Ibuprofen targets Cox two,
but it also targets Cox one,

1627
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:59,130
so it's not as bad as the selective cox 
to only inhibitors,

1628
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,210
but um,
that,

1629
01:14:00,211 --> 01:14:01,560
this was big news.
It's like,

1630
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:02,610
you know,
the fact that the,

1631
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,340
even the FDA,
even finally it was like,

1632
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:06,960
wait a minute,
something's going on here.

1633
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:10,260
We got to at least put a warning label 
on these ibuprofen volumes.

1634
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:10,980
They started doing the,

1635
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:17,170
I'm probably like eight months ago,
seven or eight months ago.

1636
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:18,750
Wow.
That's very recent.

1637
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:21,550
We consider this would have been taking 
Ibuprofen.

1638
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:26,551
Yes.
And I've been very concerned about my 

1639
01:14:26,551 --> 01:14:26,551
mom.
I actually got my mom this,

1640
01:14:26,551 --> 01:14:28,830
this Maria.
Here it is FDA drug study after.

1641
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:34,060
Wow.
This July strengthens warning that non 

1642
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:34,120
aspirin,
nonsteroidal,

1643
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:38,140
anti inflammatory can cause heart 
attacks or strokes.

1644
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:43,500
You.
So you're so used to saying things like 

1645
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:43,500
ensades.
Most people are like,

1646
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:43,710
what the fuck?
I haven't started me.

1647
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:48,890
No worries.
The US Food and Drug Administration is 

1648
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,650
strengthening existing label warnings 
that non aspirin,

1649
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:55,651
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
increase the chance of heart attack or 

1650
01:14:55,651 --> 01:14:55,960
stroke.
Wow.

1651
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:59,290
Based on our comprehensive review of 
safety information,

1652
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:04,291
we're requiring updates to drug labels 
of all prescription nonsteroidal anti 

1653
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,300
time fly.
Now this says prescription prescription,

1654
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:10,450
but if you.
But ibuprofen is Ibuprofen.

1655
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:14,410
So if you take a regular pill that has 
200 milligrams you by prescription,

1656
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:16,600
it's 800 milligrams.
I always take four.

1657
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,180
So four is 800.
Anyway.

1658
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:22,840
So if you take for advils,
it's the same as a prescription.

1659
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:25,510
Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory.
If I ever take it,

1660
01:15:25,511 --> 01:15:27,430
which I rarely do.
I always just,

1661
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:32,670
I'm a dummy.
I always just go for the full dose did 

1662
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:32,670
I've been.
So I got my mom.

1663
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:36,020
It seems to be a big problem for women 
because like I said,

1664
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:38,060
they take it for menstrual pain,
so they're,

1665
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:43,340
they're prone to like rely on that.
And like every woman I know relies on 

1666
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:43,730
it.
Like for,

1667
01:15:43,731 --> 01:15:45,560
it's like you know what a little bit of 
pain is.

1668
01:15:45,561 --> 01:15:47,360
Okay.
And you actually,

1669
01:15:47,361 --> 01:15:48,260
like,
I haven't had,

1670
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:51,740
I haven't taken ibuprofen except with 
the exception of like if I have,

1671
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,210
if there's some like surgery or 
something where I'm like,

1672
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,730
Ugh,
they're required to take it,

1673
01:15:55,731 --> 01:16:00,731
but I haven't taken it in six years.
Like I avoid it and I just,

1674
01:16:03,051 --> 01:16:05,180
I deal with pain,
menstrual pain,

1675
01:16:05,181 --> 01:16:06,800
but,
and other pain,

1676
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:07,610
I just like,
I just don't,

1677
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,020
it's not,
it's not that big of a deal,

1678
01:16:09,021 --> 01:16:10,580
you start to get used to it.
Um,

1679
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:13,330
but I got my mom this,
this Meriva,

1680
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,160
this curcumin and phosphatidylcholine 
complex.

1681
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:18,380
And I told her I was like,
take four of these a day,

1682
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:23,440
which is two grams because she's got 
arthritis and all sorts of chronic pain 

1683
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:23,930
and I have to,
it's hard for her.

1684
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:25,880
I'm trying to like get her on the right 
diet and all that.

1685
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:28,940
But compliance is an issue.
But if she starts to notice some changes

1686
01:16:28,941 --> 01:16:31,130
with something easy and it's like,
oh,

1687
01:16:31,131 --> 01:16:33,080
I do see this kind of working,
you know,

1688
01:16:33,081 --> 01:16:38,081
so that's Kinda my goal.
But she said it's been helping with her 

1689
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:38,081
with her pain.
And also,

1690
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:38,650
um,
she's like,

1691
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:42,220
she's more mobile and stuff,
so I'm from the catechumen.

1692
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,910
I'm,
I'm actually like,

1693
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:46,460
I'm thinking that it's the,
it's the.

1694
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,740
So there was a study that I did,
I tell,

1695
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,530
did I talk about the study that was done
that compared it to Ibuprofen.

1696
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:56,680
So this clinical study that compared 
people that took the Maria va curcumin 

1697
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:58,490
in the foster pedal,
colon complex,

1698
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:03,710
um,
they took two grams a day and it was 

1699
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,371
comparable.
The anti pain relief is comparable to 

1700
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:09,590
800 milligrams of Ibuprofen or thousand 
milligrams of Acetaminophen.

1701
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:13,370
Acetaminophen can be bad for the liver 
and cause liver toxicity.

1702
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,350
That's pretty awesome that it was 
comparable?

1703
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:20,410
Yes.
And comparable as far as the results 

1704
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:22,430
through subjective.
I'm like,

1705
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:24,410
what was the,
how they measure it?

1706
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:29,440
I don't remember.
Is that inflammatory markers or was it 

1707
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:29,440
like a subjective?
I don't think so.

1708
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,341
I don't think other other ones have 
measured inflammatory markers with that 

1709
01:17:33,341 --> 01:17:36,940
curcumin and phosphatidylcholine.
But I don't think this a particular 

1710
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:36,940
study did.
I think it was subjective,

1711
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:38,060
but they didn't know what they were 
getting.

1712
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:39,830
It was control.
It was like double blind controlled.

1713
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:41,610
So they were there getting something 
right.

1714
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,380
So it's just a matter of like them on a 
one to 10.

1715
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,210
How much relief did you get?
That kind of thing.

1716
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,370
I don't know.
I have to look back at the study.

1717
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:52,400
I don't remember it.
It's most likely subjective though.

1718
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:57,450
It's nice.
I have a hard time believing you don't 

1719
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:57,450
remember anything if so much shit stored
up in your brain.

1720
01:17:57,450 --> 01:18:00,080
Come flying out.
What do you have room for?

1721
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:02,150
Like friends' names and birthdays and 
stuff.

1722
01:18:02,151 --> 01:18:03,350
Was it even in the calendar?

1723
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,970
Um,
the other question that I wanted to make

1724
01:18:07,971 --> 01:18:12,971
sure that I asked you,
because we talked about this through 

1725
01:18:12,971 --> 01:18:15,521
email was I know that you've done a lot 
of work on the benefits of Sauna and the

1726
01:18:15,921 --> 01:18:19,700
heat shock proteins from sauna and I was
asking you because I recently,

1727
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:24,730
not recently,
but over the last year really got 

1728
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:26,861
heavily into hot yoga and I'm like,
I wonder if that's what's going on here 

1729
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:31,630
because I leave those classes and I 
swear to God a fucking asteroid could 

1730
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:34,010
hit my car and I'd be like,
well I guess I don't have a car anymore.

1731
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:39,430
Sot Nom nom I stay like you.
You get so chilled out from doing that 

1732
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:39,770
there.
There's some,

1733
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:44,790
there's,
there's something going on that's akin 

1734
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:47,560
to some sort of a drug response.
I think I talked about this before 

1735
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,970
because when you're hot,
when you're working,

1736
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:55,990
when you're doing hot yoga,
you're releasing dynorphins and the 

1737
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:58,811
reason you released I norfund is because
it cools the body and your body's like 

1738
01:18:58,811 --> 01:18:59,210
when you're,
when you're heating the body,

1739
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:00,470
your body tries to cool itself.

1740
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,660
When you're cooling the body,
the body tries to heat itself,

1741
01:19:02,661 --> 01:19:03,020
right?
So,

1742
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,910
so this is what's happening.
When you're doing,

1743
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:08,270
when you're doing the hot yoga,
you're making dynorphins dynorphins.

1744
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:13,450
So while you're doing it,
it's kind of like physically 

1745
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:15,341
uncomfortable.
You're holding these poses and you're 

1746
01:19:15,341 --> 01:19:15,341
like,
ah,

1747
01:19:15,341 --> 01:19:15,341
you know,
when you get out,

1748
01:19:15,341 --> 01:19:17,450
because of the whole effect on the new 
opioid receptor,

1749
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:20,750
you have more of them.
That endorphin that you released or that

1750
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:25,751
endorphin you're going to release an 
hour later when you see your kids or 

1751
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:25,751
whatever good thing happens,
man,

1752
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:28,700
it's going to be like awesome.
It's going to feel really good.

1753
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,630
No,
it's incredible.

1754
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:30,650
It's incredible.
That's what I,

1755
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:35,770
that's what got me into the sauna and 
the first place when I was in graduate 

1756
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:38,711
school because was me waking up once a 
week and screaming and like flying 

1757
01:19:38,711 --> 01:19:41,840
across the room,
punching mirrors and I literally broke.

1758
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:46,900
I broke a mirror with my.
But while I was injured I was injured 

1759
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:47,330
for.
Wait a minute.

1760
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:52,331
Where was the mirror?
It was one of those mirrors that you 

1761
01:19:52,331 --> 01:19:54,791
like buy at target and it's like you can
stick a full body mirror to see jumped 

1762
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,540
out of the bed and like throw yourself 
at it.

1763
01:19:56,570 --> 01:20:00,250
Well we had it like against the wall,
but it wasn't hung on the wall so it was

1764
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:04,220
like cleaning cars cheap and whatever.
Just busy.

1765
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,260
Whatever it does,
it's serving a function.

1766
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:08,310
I can see myself.
So I like,

1767
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,400
it was kind of close to the bed so I 
like flew off the bed and like hit the 

1768
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,070
mirror with my butt and broke it.
And I was injured for like,

1769
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,590
there was like two months I couldn't 
run.

1770
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:21,690
I couldn't do,
I couldn't do squats,

1771
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:22,860
I couldn't.
I was like,

1772
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,390
if I didn't have the sauna in the 
mirror,

1773
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:24,960
is that what you're saying?

1774
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,920
But you know,
I like muscle tendon.

1775
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:29,250
I don't know.
I don't know.

1776
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:31,800
I have no idea what I did all from 
sleep.

1777
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,960
From anxiety,
yes.

1778
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:35,730
So crazy.
But you can see why.

1779
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:38,610
Like when I discovered the sauna I was 
like,

1780
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,200
wow,
this is.

1781
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,660
Because I would go,
I would go to the sauna.

1782
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:47,661
I lived across the street from the MCA 
and so the YMC has a sauna and I would 

1783
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:52,260
wake up in the morning and I'd go work 
out or do the sauna both,

1784
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:57,290
you know.
So I'd go and I sit in the sauna for 

1785
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:59,871
like 30 to 45 minutes.
I mean I was pushing it and I was 

1786
01:20:59,871 --> 01:21:00,430
miserable.
It was hot and,

1787
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,570
and there are times when I would stay in
there for 45 minutes.

1788
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:09,050
I'm not recommending people do this,
I'm just telling you what I have 

1789
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:09,750
experienced and I'd get out for five 
minutes and then I go back in,

1790
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:09,910
you know.

1791
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:14,990
So I was like,
I just pushed it and that would go into 

1792
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:16,860
the lab and it didn't matter who was 
stressing me out.

1793
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:21,861
He was telling me what to do,
what or if my experiments were failing 

1794
01:21:21,861 --> 01:21:21,861
and I was like,
oh my God,

1795
01:21:21,861 --> 01:21:23,550
six months of work down the drain,
you know,

1796
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:24,840
like,
I didn't care.

1797
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:25,380
I was like,
oh,

1798
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:30,381
okay,
I'll have to start over after we think 

1799
01:21:30,381 --> 01:21:30,381
this.
Like,

1800
01:21:30,381 --> 01:21:30,381
wow,
it was.

1801
01:21:30,381 --> 01:21:30,840
So I was like,
that's when I looked and I was like,

1802
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,870
something's going on,
something's going on.

1803
01:21:33,871 --> 01:21:35,250
I got to figure it out.
I want to know.

1804
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,520
And that's when I like started just 
going into the brain effects on the 

1805
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,071
sauna.
Everyone always focuses on the 

1806
01:21:43,071 --> 01:21:43,071
detoxification and all that.
I was like,

1807
01:21:43,071 --> 01:21:43,410
dude,
something's happened in my brain.

1808
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,640
I don't know what I'm saying,
dude.

1809
01:21:44,641 --> 01:21:47,290
All the time.
It's like a nervous thing to do.

1810
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:51,120
Not usually do that.
I'm not really.

1811
01:21:51,121 --> 01:21:52,890
Not all the time I'll say dude,
but not like,

1812
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:56,860
not like you're wired,
you fired up.

1813
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:00,060
Um.
So do you think that a similar effect is

1814
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:04,200
happening when you're doing hot yoga?
Even though it's not as hot as a,

1815
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:09,201
the sauna,
it's 90 minutes at 104 degrees and 

1816
01:22:09,201 --> 01:22:09,840
you're doing physical activity,
you're straining.

1817
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:15,030
Anything that's causing you to sweat is 
gonna cause you to release the endorphin

1818
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,270
because you're,
you're,

1819
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,530
you're overheating,
right?

1820
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,490
That's the way your sweat is supposed to
help you.

1821
01:22:20,491 --> 01:22:22,830
Cool.
So you're also releasing dynorphins.

1822
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,950
There hasn't been a study on hot yoga.
I get this question a lot.

1823
01:22:25,951 --> 01:22:28,320
There hasn't been a study on steam 
rooms.

1824
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:30,990
There hasn't been a study will.
There hasn't.

1825
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:35,250
There's been a couple of studies on hot 
baths are a Jacuzzi's,

1826
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:37,860
but not looking at the brain,
looking at other things.

1827
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:41,460
I'm personally,
if you just think about the mechanisms,

1828
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:44,430
I think that it's very likely and if 
you're gonna,

1829
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,280
if you're pushing yourself to sweat,
if you feel uncomfortable,

1830
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,840
then you're,
you're,

1831
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:53,870
you're doing the right thing,
you're releasing dynorphins and you're 

1832
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:53,870
getting the heat shock proteins.
You're getting all that good stuff.

1833
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:56,220
So it makes sense.
Yeah.

1834
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,690
Yeah.
So it's in it.

1835
01:22:57,691 --> 01:23:02,691
It is very addicting.
It's also part of the reason why 

1836
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:02,691
exercise can become addicting.
People always,

1837
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:04,350
always attributed to the endorphin 
release.

1838
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:07,670
I actually think it has a lot to do.
Also with the dynorphins,

1839
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:12,750
the pain you experienced,
the discomfort you experience is very 

1840
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:12,750
important,
uh,

1841
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:17,280
because you're actually then having that
response that hormetic you can almost 

1842
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,890
think of it as a hormetic response 
because the discomfort is what's causing

1843
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:26,130
you to make more of the new opioid 
receptors that you're more sensitive to 

1844
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:26,130
the endorphin and more sensitive to 
that.

1845
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:29,170
Um,
feel good stuff.

1846
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:34,560
It's funny because that's one of the 
main things that people try to avoid in 

1847
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,070
life is discomfort.
That is probably,

1848
01:23:36,071 --> 01:23:38,530
if you,
if you looked at especially lazy people,

1849
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,880
you looked at the primary thing,
they try to avoid the turn.

1850
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:41,860
Avoid Discomfort.

1851
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,040
Yep.
Yep.

1852
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,890
Like this,
this morning I woke up and I was like,

1853
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:50,090
I have to go to gym,
have to go and have to,

1854
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:52,210
like,
I got to like push it and I was running.

1855
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:54,620
I was doing sprinting on the treadmill.
Usually I,

1856
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:55,490
I,
uh,

1857
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:58,520
usually a sprint,
like the last end of my run,

1858
01:23:58,521 --> 01:24:00,830
but I was just spreading and I was like,
so I was doing it.

1859
01:24:00,831 --> 01:24:01,280
I was like,
oh,

1860
01:24:01,281 --> 01:24:03,110
this sucks,
this sucks,

1861
01:24:03,111 --> 01:24:06,740
but I have to do it because I'm,
my brain is going to help me.

1862
01:24:06,830 --> 01:24:10,220
The dynorphins and also the 
norepinephrine norepinephrine,

1863
01:24:10,221 --> 01:24:12,410
which is um,
you release when you exercise,

1864
01:24:12,411 --> 01:24:17,411
release a lot of it in the cold.
I took a cold shower to cold shower was 

1865
01:24:17,411 --> 01:24:20,891
like a pretty good as well because the 
cold also norepinephrine released nor 

1866
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:27,370
nor epinephrin when you're exposed to 
cold because norepinephrine causes 

1867
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:30,590
vasodilation.
And so when you have vasodilation,

1868
01:24:30,591 --> 01:24:34,100
you actually are losing less heat.

1869
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,730
I always take cold showers after hot 
yoga.

1870
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:42,720
It's amazing in the winter because in 
the winter there was actually cold 

1871
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,490
because of water here is not really that
cold because it's California.

1872
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:49,860
If it gets cold out it's like 50,
but when it's 50 the water's actually 

1873
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:54,541
cold.
So like after a hot yoga you get in 

1874
01:24:54,541 --> 01:24:54,541
there.
It's really uncomfortable.

1875
01:24:54,541 --> 01:24:55,510
It's hard to breathe,
you know.

1876
01:24:55,570 --> 01:25:00,570
But when I lived in Boston,
there was a guy named Bob a roller that 

1877
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:01,960
I used to do taekwondo with this guy in 
the middle of January.

1878
01:25:01,961 --> 01:25:06,961
We take cold showers and he'd say that 
it's good for the spirit and he was 

1879
01:25:06,961 --> 01:25:06,961
like,
the only guy that would do it,

1880
01:25:06,961 --> 01:25:08,080
everybody would just stand there and 
watch them.

1881
01:25:08,081 --> 01:25:13,081
Bob's going to go in the shower and he 
go in the shower by himself and to 

1882
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:13,081
obviously by himself.
We're like,

1883
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:18,210
we're going in the shower with him,
but this guy would take these cold 

1884
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:18,370
showers and I just.
I couldn't imagine why anybody would put

1885
01:25:18,371 --> 01:25:23,371
themselves through something like that,
but I guess he kind of knew even back 

1886
01:25:23,371 --> 01:25:26,500
then there was some sort of a benefit to
standing in that freezing cold water and

1887
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:30,970
just not just mentally as far as like 
your discipline and your self control to

1888
01:25:30,971 --> 01:25:33,430
be able to stand there and force 
yourself to do something like that,

1889
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,770
to have that sort of autonomy over your 
body like that,

1890
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:39,670
but also because there's,
there's all these different releases,

1891
01:25:39,671 --> 01:25:43,360
these powerful endorphin releases that 
you're getting from that.

1892
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:44,540
Yeah,
it feels good.

1893
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:45,530
It feels really good.

1894
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:50,930
Is there any danger in going from say,
a hot yoga class to cryotherapy?

1895
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:56,840
I would love to know the answer to that,
so I've.

1896
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:59,410
I've recently experienced,
um,

1897
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,630
I've,
I've gone from a really hot sauna,

1898
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:07,660
like crazy hot.
I mean it was like 180 degrees 

1899
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:07,700
Fahrenheit.
Yeah.

1900
01:26:07,701 --> 01:26:11,530
I had to wear one of those hats.
It was crazy hot,

1901
01:26:11,531 --> 01:26:16,370
like the hottest I've ever experienced.
So I went and I was with an acquaintance

1902
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,670
of mine,
um,

1903
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,410
and then I went directly into an ice 
bath and I did four rounds of this,

1904
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,230
like for,
and it,

1905
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:29,380
like the experience itself was amazing.
Like I felt really,

1906
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:31,820
really good,
really good,

1907
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:35,210
like euphoric entering.
Well I was in the cold.

1908
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:40,630
Well,
once you go in the ice bath and you go 

1909
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:40,630
back into the sauna,
like,

1910
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:41,930
and you're in 180 degree Fahrenheit 
Sauna,

1911
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,690
it actually feels like room temperature 
and it's kind of like,

1912
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:49,190
whoa,
this is something kind of cool about it.

1913
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:50,780
Like you just,
you feel really,

1914
01:26:50,781 --> 01:26:52,400
really good.
Um,

1915
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:57,730
I,
there were points when I started to get 

1916
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:59,411
a little light headed and spinny so 
spinny and it was maybe low blood 

1917
01:27:02,961 --> 01:27:04,370
pressure,
low blood glucose.

1918
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:05,030
I hadn't,
you know,

1919
01:27:05,031 --> 01:27:06,200
I don't know,
something like that.

1920
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:08,150
But I'm,
I'm,

1921
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:10,640
I'm,
I'm really wanting to know and I have to

1922
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,290
look into the literature,
you know,

1923
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:17,291
I put,
I just recently put out a report and a 

1924
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:17,450
podcast on cryotherapy and the benefits 
of cold,

1925
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:23,110
but I really was hoping to find more on 
going from hot to cold because mostly 

1926
01:27:23,241 --> 01:27:28,241
one I felt so good.
And the other thing it does it reset my 

1927
01:27:28,241 --> 01:27:28,241
circadian rhythm completely.
Like I just,

1928
01:27:28,241 --> 01:27:30,650
I went to bed at like 9:30
and I slept like a baby.

1929
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,950
It was like,
how do you think it did that?

1930
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:36,350
I don't know.
I think that there's something,

1931
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,050
I don't know if it was the hot cold or 
just the cold,

1932
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:40,520
um,
ics.

1933
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:43,670
So I,
so I did this around 6:00

1934
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:47,690
so it was like right before bedtime,
but I'm cold.

1935
01:27:47,691 --> 01:27:49,520
Does,
you know there is a circuit,

1936
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:54,700
there is a regulation of when your body 
starts to cool itself and it cools 

1937
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,730
itself right before sleep.
Melatonin plays a role in that.

1938
01:27:55,940 --> 01:28:00,940
When you make Melatonin,
it actually starts to cool the body a 

1939
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:01,340
little bit as well.
I really don't know,

1940
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:02,540
Joe.
I was trying to figure it out,

1941
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:08,020
people aren't doing studies on it,
but it was very real and I experienced 

1942
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:08,360
it.
Is there a difference between doing cold

1943
01:28:08,361 --> 01:28:10,700
before you go to the bed and doing a 
song before you go to bed?

1944
01:28:10,701 --> 01:28:15,701
As far as the results I'm doing,
the sauna sometimes can actually like 

1945
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:19,430
immediately keep you up,
but also it's.

1946
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:23,480
It affects rem sleep and that's been 
shown and piglets as well and Dan swears

1947
01:28:23,481 --> 01:28:25,460
that he would have all sorts of lucid 
dreams.

1948
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:31,410
I don't remember.
I don't really remember that aspect of 

1949
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:32,030
it,
but it does seem to affect sleep,

1950
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:35,600
so lucid dreams from like the heat or 
something.

1951
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:36,990
Probably not.
Maybe.

1952
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,690
Maybe something else going on in the 
brain.

1953
01:28:38,691 --> 01:28:41,780
You also do release norepinephrine from,
from anything.

1954
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:44,870
That's when you,
when you're stressing your body,

1955
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:46,400
when you're doing your workout,
good enough.

1956
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:51,401
Like any sort of stress.
Also a stimulation like novelty 

1957
01:28:51,401 --> 01:28:52,250
releases,
norepinephrine and that,

1958
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:54,920
you know,
maybe Acetylcholine is being released.

1959
01:28:54,921 --> 01:28:56,360
I don't know.
You know,

1960
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,690
they're,
they're calling.

1961
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,660
It does have some sort of a positive 
effect on,

1962
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:02,010
on dreaming,
right?

1963
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:07,370
Yeah.
People report really intense lucid 

1964
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:08,100
dreams from taking a lot of different 
nootropics,

1965
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:09,240
but particularly Coleen,

1966
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:14,630
someone was telling me about galantamine
because I was talking about it before 

1967
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:14,670
and someone was like,
Oh,

1968
01:29:14,671 --> 01:29:16,800
this causes lucid dreams.
I wouldn't have known that,

1969
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:19,320
but there's some.
Yeah,

1970
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:20,480
there's some,
some aspect.

1971
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:26,280
Five htp as well.
Five htp may be beneficial to lucid 

1972
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,280
dreaming.
Something about

1973
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:32,750
that's strange because Serotonin in the 
brain gets you out of it.

1974
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,410
It takes you out of rem sleep.
Serotonin

1975
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:41,770
takes you out.
So if you were going to take five htp 

1976
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:41,770
should take it in the morning,
then

1977
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:44,430
I don't know what the whole half life 
and all that.

1978
01:29:44,431 --> 01:29:49,431
I mean it has to like five htp has to 
then get into your brain and then be 

1979
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:49,431
converted to Serotonin and

1980
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:54,530
I don't know,
so it might actually be good to take it 

1981
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:54,530
at night and then by the morning rolls 
around,

1982
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:56,350
it's done converting it.
No.

1983
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:56,970
No.
Okay.

1984
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,400
Sorry.
Um,

1985
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:03,820
the,
what would it take to do some sort of a 

1986
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,741
study like the study that has been done 
on the sauna for something like hot 

1987
01:30:06,741 --> 01:30:08,640
yoga?
What would you do that,

1988
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:12,620
let's see,
it depends on what you want to measure.

1989
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:16,730
So I think if you want to look at heat 
shock proteins,

1990
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:20,150
um,
you could look at them in blood cells,

1991
01:30:20,151 --> 01:30:23,180
so you can measure them in blood cells.
You could look at,

1992
01:30:23,181 --> 01:30:28,181
you could measure norepinephrine from.
There's actually a biomarker of 

1993
01:30:28,181 --> 01:30:32,621
norepinephrine that is called salivary 
Alpha amylase and it's released in 

1994
01:30:32,621 --> 01:30:37,001
saliva.
And actually it would actually be 

1995
01:30:37,001 --> 01:30:37,001
really,
that would be a marker,

1996
01:30:37,001 --> 01:30:41,231
like if your workout,
if you're pushing your workout hard 

1997
01:30:41,231 --> 01:30:43,391
enough,
you'll release more of that Alpha 

1998
01:30:43,391 --> 01:30:43,391
amylase,
some more,

1999
01:30:43,391 --> 01:30:44,150
more norepinephrine,
so you can measure that.

2000
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:49,960
And then hsps.
So you just have to have volunteers and 

2001
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,801
then sauna,
then you'd have to have a lot of people 

2002
01:30:53,801 --> 01:30:53,801
that are gonna,
you know,

2003
01:30:53,801 --> 01:30:56,030
take the blood,
you have to have physicians involved and

2004
01:30:56,031 --> 01:30:57,970
then you have to have people that are 
gonna,

2005
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:01,070
you know,
isolate and look at the protein.

2006
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:03,380
Maybe even looking at gene expression 
would be cheaper.

2007
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:06,200
I'm doing something similar but not with
sauna.

2008
01:31:06,201 --> 01:31:09,140
I've been involved in a clinical trial 
with blueberries.

2009
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:13,010
Actually another one of those plant 
hormetic compounds.

2010
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:15,500
There's another one in blueberries 
called Anthocyanins,

2011
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:16,520
which is really,
really,

2012
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:19,170
blueberries contain a small amount of 
territory.

2013
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:23,290
They contain very late,
about 10 percent of a grape skin has.

2014
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:25,190
So the blueberries,
what,

2015
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:27,890
what's really good.
And blueberries is called anthocyanins.

2016
01:31:27,891 --> 01:31:31,460
Anthocyanins are produced as a response,
you know,

2017
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,590
they're,
they're a plant insecticide.

2018
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:39,010
Uh,
they actually like they bind to a 

2019
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:40,760
certain gene,
the Anthocyanin itself recognizes like a

2020
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:44,390
little sequence of DNA and turn and bind
to the street and like turns it on.

2021
01:31:44,391 --> 01:31:48,200
And this gene is called NRF two and it's
like a master regulator of all these,

2022
01:31:48,201 --> 01:31:51,980
like really good repairing DNA repair 
enzymes.

2023
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,720
I'm antioxidant enzymes,
anti-inflammatory,

2024
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:55,640
all these good things.

2025
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Um,
and so I've been involved in a clinical 

2026
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,981
trial for the past two,
maybe even two and a half years now 

2027
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:02,990
where,
um,

2028
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,110
my colleagues and I,
we've been looking,

2029
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:08,050
we've been taking blood from people that
are,

2030
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:13,930
they're obese.
Their BMI is about 28 or above.

2031
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,450
They're obese.
Their insulin 28 is,

2032
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,950
he is obese.
Well,

2033
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:21,850
they also measure BMI is 30 is actually 
obese.

2034
01:32:21,851 --> 01:32:26,851
We moved it,
we moved the BMI down to 28 because it 

2035
01:32:26,851 --> 01:32:26,851
was like we weren't getting enough 
people.

2036
01:32:26,851 --> 01:32:29,590
A 30 is technically considered obese.
Wow.

2037
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,230
Yeah.
Well,

2038
01:32:32,231 --> 01:32:34,140
I mean a lot of people were 30,
right.

2039
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:39,150
You have to consider BMI is not a really
good measure of obesity because people 

2040
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:43,060
that are very muscular and short may 
also have a high BMI.

2041
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:46,500
So you have to also look at waist 
circumference and other factors which,

2042
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,770
which they are doing.
Um,

2043
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:51,040
but,
but there are a lot of obese people.

2044
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:56,250
There are,
there are a lot of obese people and 

2045
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:58,021
we're looking at a certain percentage of
them that are right on the border of 

2046
01:32:58,021 --> 01:33:01,141
becoming type two diabetics.
So they're insulin resistant so their 

2047
01:33:01,141 --> 01:33:04,120
body is not responding to insulin but 
they're not type two diabetic clinically

2048
01:33:04,121 --> 01:33:05,340
yet.
Um,

2049
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:06,130
and so we're,
we're,

2050
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:11,180
we're getting rid recruiting these 
people and we've gotten 50 of them and 

2051
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:14,851
half of them are getting a freeze dried 
blueberry powder that's equivalent to 

2052
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:20,341
two cups of blueberries and it's got 
lots of anthocyanins and all this other 

2053
01:33:20,341 --> 01:33:24,061
stuff that's in the blueberries.
And the other half is getting a placebo 

2054
01:33:24,061 --> 01:33:25,060
drink,
which is blue looking and they put sugar

2055
01:33:25,061 --> 01:33:25,710
in it,
which is.

2056
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:31,750
But yeah,
you gotta you can't give someone a 

2057
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:31,750
placebo and not.
And not taste like blueberry.

2058
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:35,691
Right.
Is there any benefit to eating actual 

2059
01:33:35,691 --> 01:33:35,691
blueberries versus the freeze dried 
powders?

2060
01:33:35,691 --> 01:33:36,940
Yeah.
You're getting the fiber,

2061
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:39,010
you know,
you're,

2062
01:33:39,011 --> 01:33:41,560
you're getting probably that's the main 
thing,

2063
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:46,561
that fiber and who knows what other 
compounds that may be not maybe 

2064
01:33:46,561 --> 01:33:47,650
destroyed somewhat by the freeze.
Dry.

2065
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:52,660
I don't really,
that's what I would be confused about 

2066
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:52,660
them.
I've always been confused about that.

2067
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:53,920
And when you see the various freeze 
dried,

2068
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,020
you know,
anything or any,

2069
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:58,060
any sort of dried,
powdered anything,

2070
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,460
I always wonder like how much of that 
are you actually giving?

2071
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,420
Like what,
what,

2072
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:06,530
what's,
how much of the actual benefit is lost 

2073
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:06,530
in this turn?
Turning it into a pill.

2074
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:08,190
Yeah.
So there's definitely some,

2075
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:13,210
some things that are lost,
but the specific things that I'm 

2076
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:13,210
interested in,
like the anthocyanins are there.

2077
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:16,350
Um,
but so what I've been looking at it,

2078
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:18,310
there's other people that I'm working 
with are looking at,

2079
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:19,430
um,
you know,

2080
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,480
markers of inflammation,
glucose response,

2081
01:34:22,481 --> 01:34:24,070
like all the metabolic parameters.

2082
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:28,660
I'm specifically looking at people's 
damage to their DNA.

2083
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:33,720
So like we get white blood cells and the
frozen down and then I look at the DNA 

2084
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:35,230
and the white blood cells and see how 
much damage there is.

2085
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:40,740
I do it at baseline.
So before they start the blueberry 

2086
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:40,740
powders and these people have a lot of 
damage because they're obese.

2087
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,130
Obesity accelerates,
damage to DNA,

2088
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:44,890
damage to DNA causes all sorts of 
problems.

2089
01:34:44,891 --> 01:34:49,390
But eventually it leads to cancer.
And people that are obese have a twofold

2090
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:54,750
increased risk of multiple cancers.
Ridiculous article that I read were 

2091
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,990
talking about the positive benefits of 
being overweight and were

2092
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:01,970
where people were trying to justify 
being overweight and they were.

2093
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:06,980
I'm talking about there's a certain 
illnesses that people recover from 

2094
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:12,041
better if they're overweight.
And they were very few very strange 

2095
01:35:12,111 --> 01:35:16,370
examples they were using.
They try to justify being overweight.

2096
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:21,720
And um,
and it was also the article was also 

2097
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:23,600
impartially in response to quote unquote
fat shaming,

2098
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:24,590
you know,
and I'm like,

2099
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:27,290
boy,
this is just such a weird justification.

2100
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:31,490
It's so bizarre that your,
your very biology,

2101
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:33,350
very the thing that gets you through 
life,

2102
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,400
that people are so intent on receiving 
mouth pleasure,

2103
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:38,840
which is all it is.
I mean,

2104
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:40,910
that's what you're doing when you're 
shoveling food in your mouth,

2105
01:35:40,911 --> 01:35:43,460
you're getting mouth pleasure and then 
you're getting the response,

2106
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:46,280
the,
the physical response to whatever sugars

2107
01:35:46,281 --> 01:35:47,130
or anything that you,
you,

2108
01:35:47,131 --> 01:35:47,630
you know,
your,

2109
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,360
your body and your gut bacteria craving.
But so,

2110
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:55,390
so much into that you're broadcasting it
in the form of this is like really 

2111
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:59,591
misleading article that was just 
designed to make you feel better for 

2112
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:03,740
being overweight and to justify these 
choices that you've made,

2113
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:06,020
which are terrible,
terrible choices.

2114
01:36:06,021 --> 01:36:08,090
Like there's no benefit whatsoever to 
being overweight,

2115
01:36:08,091 --> 01:36:08,350
right?

2116
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,410
No,
I mean,

2117
01:36:09,411 --> 01:36:14,411
being overweight,
being overweight is linked to increased 

2118
01:36:14,451 --> 01:36:17,330
risk for cardiovascular disease,
increased risk for type two diabetes,

2119
01:36:17,331 --> 01:36:20,330
increased risk for cancer,
increased risk of stroke in prison.

2120
01:36:20,331 --> 01:36:21,090
You know,
it's,

2121
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:23,090
it's increased rate of Alzheimer's 
disease.

2122
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:28,350
It's yeah,
so I mean having an increased risk for 

2123
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:29,640
all of those age related diseases is not
good to them.

2124
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:32,750
Articles written about the positive 
benefits being overweight.

2125
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,920
I haven't seen those.
You see if you can find some of that 

2126
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:37,920
Jamie,

2127
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,410
people that are fat that are just trying
to use confirmation bias and locked into

2128
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:47,350
whatever small,
weird statistic might exist in regards 

2129
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:50,210
to like maybe they'd get over like a 
cold better or something.

2130
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:51,890
It's like it's really dumb.

2131
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:56,980
Actually.
Obesity starts to cause I'm 

2132
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:58,880
immunosenescence because and and 
problems with your immune system because

2133
01:36:59,270 --> 01:37:02,780
people that are overweight or obese,
they,

2134
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:07,810
they have a lot more inflammation in 
their body and inflammation takes a lot 

2135
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:08,660
of energy.
Here it is.

2136
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:11,330
Five surprising health benefits of being
overweight.

2137
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:15,650
Being overweight carries a reduced Chris
Rheumatoid arthritis.

2138
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:18,470
It's because your joints are all greased
up.

2139
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:21,490
I'd like to see the references on that.
Being overweight means

2140
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:26,490
you're less likely to develop dementia.
Being overweight can make a stronger 

2141
01:37:26,921 --> 01:37:27,850
immune system.
Yeah.

2142
01:37:27,851 --> 01:37:32,851
See,
that's one of the things that I had 

2143
01:37:32,851 --> 01:37:32,851
read,
like what?

2144
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:38,130
Hold on.
Is it possibly to be fit healthy and 

2145
01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:38,130
fat,
to be fats to Farian?

2146
01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:41,650
What does that mean?
Frat staffy in what does that.

2147
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:44,860
What does that word to protect your body
from possible harm.

2148
01:37:44,861 --> 01:37:49,861
Rendering potential problems.
Harmless even before incursion to 

2149
01:37:49,861 --> 01:37:53,641
explain on a slightly more plain level,
the cytologists are proposing that 

2150
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:56,400
you're extra bulk works like a blubbery 
barrier.

2151
01:37:56,401 --> 01:37:57,660
Indeed,
the big men,

2152
01:37:57,661 --> 01:38:02,661
Danny Ross who was stabbed,
all that's different that someone was 

2153
01:38:02,661 --> 01:38:05,391
stabbed.
Somebody fell 20 feet and Lawrence Bell 

2154
01:38:05,391 --> 01:38:05,391
Hus,
Blah Blah Blah Blah,

2155
01:38:05,391 --> 01:38:10,280
or po,
po portly poster boys for the defensive 

2156
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:10,280
qualities of flat,
but that's ridiculous.

2157
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:12,060
That's like,
that's like wearing armor.

2158
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,680
You know you're talking about someone 
like.

2159
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,780
Yeah,
physically,

2160
01:38:15,781 --> 01:38:17,370
if you're that something that around 
police,

2161
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:22,670
if you physically,
if you have like all this extra fat on 

2162
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:22,670
your body and something hits you.

2163
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:26,190
Yeah.
You've got like a wall between you,

2164
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:30,120
your actual organs and your,
your bones and this.

2165
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:35,600
This impact that's so stupid though.
Being overweight is linked to increase 

2166
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,030
longevity and recovery time.
What know?

2167
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:40,230
Now it's not.
Scroll down.

2168
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:45,310
I'm not saying is it okay to,
to fat shame overweight men.

2169
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:52,740
Make that larger police kitten oaks,
that fat tissue as well as hormones it 

2170
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:57,171
releases,
improves bodily defense mechanisms by 

2171
01:38:57,171 --> 01:38:58,110
providing vital energy reserves and anti
inflammatory agents.

2172
01:38:58,350 --> 01:39:03,350
As a result,
despite overweight individuals being 

2173
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:03,720
more susceptible to serious health 
issues to begin with,

2174
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:08,721
they are less likely to die from them 
than those who are underweight or even 

2175
01:39:08,721 --> 01:39:10,260
with healthy BMI is heart disease,
for example,

2176
01:39:10,261 --> 01:39:14,700
is four times more likely to claim the 
life of somebody with a healthy Bmi than

2177
01:39:14,701 --> 01:39:17,090
an individual considered overweight.
This is horseshit.

2178
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:19,920
It is.
This is not absolutely opposite.

2179
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:22,170
No studies that the onion.
Is this a forest?

2180
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:22,710
No.
No.

2181
01:39:22,711 --> 01:39:24,150
What is the.
What is the website?

2182
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:29,390
The Telegraph.
Whether articles too is just the one I 

2183
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:32,151
figured would have the scroll.
Scroll down a little further and being 

2184
01:39:32,151 --> 01:39:32,550
overweight can mean you're better in the
bedroom.

2185
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:33,960
Oh,
shut the fuck up.

2186
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,990
This is a fat guy.
Fat Guy wrote this hormones,

2187
01:39:36,991 --> 01:39:41,991
found in abdominal fat,
allow men to last longer in the bedroom 

2188
01:39:41,991 --> 01:39:41,991
bowl.

2189
01:39:41,991 --> 01:39:46,260
I'd like to see the references for any 
of these statements because actually 

2190
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:47,080
it's quite the opposite.
Being overweight or being obese,

2191
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:49,390
it's associated with seven years off 
your life span,

2192
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:52,160
extremely obese is 14 years off your 
life span.

2193
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:57,640
Um,
obesity is the number one risk factor 

2194
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:58,840
for heart disease and type two diabetes.
Um,

2195
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:01,100
it also is associated with massive 
inflammation.

2196
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:04,520
What's this?
The Journal of sexual medicine inside on

2197
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:09,550
pathogenesis.
Genesis of lifelong premature 

2198
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:12,341
ejaculation.
Inverse relationship between lifelong 

2199
01:40:12,341 --> 01:40:13,580
premature ejaculation and obesity.
Yeah,

2200
01:40:13,581 --> 01:40:18,581
but you know what,
that's because of the obese guys aren't 

2201
01:40:18,581 --> 01:40:18,581
getting laid and they probably jerk off 
so much.

2202
01:40:18,581 --> 01:40:21,110
They can last forever.
This is a stupid study.

2203
01:40:21,111 --> 01:40:22,730
That's it.
This is an association.

2204
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:26,780
There's some premature ejaculation.
Has to do with anxiety,

2205
01:40:26,781 --> 01:40:31,781
has to do a lot.
There's a lot of factors involved and 

2206
01:40:31,781 --> 01:40:32,240
premature ejaculation and what exactly 
is premature?

2207
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:37,450
I mean it's a completely relative and 
subjective term because if you come and 

2208
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:38,360
you enjoyed it,
it was perfectly timed.

2209
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:44,020
It's not premature.
I mean it's just like you didn't hold 

2210
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:47,171
on.
I mean the whole idea of holding on as 

2211
01:40:47,171 --> 01:40:48,440
long as a cultural construct holding on 
as long as you can.

2212
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:50,990
I mean that's just,
we've decided that that's a good thing.

2213
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:53,120
I mean obviously for mutually

2214
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:57,940
mutually beneficial pleasurable 
experience for your partner.

2215
01:40:57,941 --> 01:41:00,790
Yeah,
it's probably last longer than you know,

2216
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:02,470
that's what woman would like,
but.

2217
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:04,750
But what is pr?
It's not premature.

2218
01:41:04,751 --> 01:41:05,220
The,
the,

2219
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:07,930
the end goal is to try to breed.
It's try to procreate,

2220
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,570
right?
Is if you get it in there and as long as

2221
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:12,520
you get it in there,
it's not premature.

2222
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:17,670
Like biologically speaking,
it sounds like it's pretty subjective 

2223
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:18,130
there.
Their definition of premature.

2224
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:23,300
I mean what does that mean?
Let the idea that you can connect all 

2225
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:26,260
those things and say that there's some 
sort of a positive benefit to being fat.

2226
01:41:26,261 --> 01:41:28,150
That's click bait bullshit.
That's what that is.

2227
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,440
There's,
there's very

2228
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:34,450
strong evidence of everything.
The opposite of what you just read.

2229
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:36,490
Yeah.
Like I just don't even.

2230
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:38,330
I,
I really just don't even know where they

2231
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:43,580
came from.
Maybe some crappy associative studies 

2232
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:43,580
that were done,
but I mean the large body of,

2233
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:48,770
of the literature shows the opposite,
but isn't that way confusing when you 

2234
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:52,701
see things like that,
like in the Telegraph that probably got 

2235
01:41:52,701 --> 01:41:53,470
read by a million plus people or more 
worldwide?

2236
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:55,530
Probably even more than that.
It's irritating.

2237
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:56,540
It's crazy.
Yeah,

2238
01:41:56,850 --> 01:42:01,850
but those are the kinds of articles that
people will use to justify their poor 

2239
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:04,080
life choices and this was this same kind
of thing.

2240
01:42:04,081 --> 01:42:09,081
Not that article in particular is what 
I'd read about when someone was talking 

2241
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:09,081
about fat shaming.
I'm like,

2242
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:09,420
come on,
man.

2243
01:42:09,421 --> 01:42:11,600
There's no such thing as fat shaming.
Look,

2244
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,890
it's.
It's rude to be mean to people.

2245
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:18,950
Yeah.
It's rude to like pointed someone laugh 

2246
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:20,991
because they're fat,
but to suggest that someone being 

2247
01:42:20,991 --> 01:42:21,750
overweight is bad for the health is not 
fat shaming.

2248
01:42:21,751 --> 01:42:22,680
It's just fact.

2249
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:23,910
Yeah,
and it's also,

2250
01:42:23,911 --> 01:42:28,911
you're,
you're trying to help someone you want 

2251
01:42:28,911 --> 01:42:28,911
to say,
look,

2252
01:42:28,911 --> 01:42:28,911
you know,
there,

2253
01:42:28,911 --> 01:42:32,331
there have we know mechanism.
We know there's been studies that show 

2254
01:42:32,331 --> 01:42:34,110
that being overweight causes 
inflammation.

2255
01:42:34,111 --> 01:42:39,111
It's your immune system's constantly 
being active and not get crosses into 

2256
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:41,760
the brain and causes depression.
It causes anxiety,

2257
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:46,910
it causes learning and memory problems.
So you may not be working and that's 

2258
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:47,700
been shown.
You may not be working at your optimum,

2259
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:49,650
you know,
being overweight,

2260
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:51,690
you could feel better,
you know,

2261
01:42:51,691 --> 01:42:54,780
so it's,
it's kind of ridiculous.

2262
01:42:54,781 --> 01:42:59,781
I think I agree with you and I have 
friends that are overweight and I've 

2263
01:42:59,781 --> 01:43:02,370
always been the person that I'm all,
I feel like I'm lecturing,

2264
01:43:02,371 --> 01:43:03,390
you know,
because it's always,

2265
01:43:03,391 --> 01:43:08,391
I'm always like all these benefits and I
rattle off all this stuff and all this 

2266
01:43:08,391 --> 01:43:11,040
information and then there's a certain 
point it's like this person probably has

2267
01:43:11,041 --> 01:43:14,070
gets defensive and doesn't want to hear 
it,

2268
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:19,520
but I care about them and that's 
actually part of the reason I started 

2269
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,161
making videos and doing what I do 
without my fitness actually because I 

2270
01:43:22,161 --> 01:43:23,340
was constantly doing this to friends and
family members,

2271
01:43:23,341 --> 01:43:27,300
people I cared about where it was like 
at least if you put something out there,

2272
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:31,230
like if you put a video out there or an 
article or a podcast or something,

2273
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:33,330
they don't feel like you're targeting 
them.

2274
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:34,740
So then you can just go,
oh yeah,

2275
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:36,510
I talked about that.
You should go check it out.

2276
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:38,520
You know,
and you know what it does.

2277
01:43:38,521 --> 01:43:40,530
It seems because people would get less 
defensive.

2278
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:46,510
Well,
it seems to me that there's a certain 

2279
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:48,170
amount of information just won't get 
through some people's wall.

2280
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:50,120
They have a wall,
this is what I like to do.

2281
01:43:50,121 --> 01:43:51,710
I like to eat cake.
That's it.

2282
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:52,700
And then you know,
like,

2283
01:43:52,730 --> 01:43:57,730
Hey,
KC has sugar and sugar is bad and being 

2284
01:43:57,730 --> 01:43:59,010
obese is bad and cancer and blood 
pressure and uh,

2285
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:01,510
sorry it's not getting in.
I'm going home.

2286
01:44:01,511 --> 01:44:06,511
I'll have some fucking cake.
It's kind of a rule like that mouth 

2287
01:44:06,511 --> 01:44:08,830
pleasure that they get from shoving that
cake and oh,

2288
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:11,240
they just can't wait.
And then the craving,

2289
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:16,510
you know,
we had talked quite a bit about gut 

2290
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:18,980
bacteria because of your experience with
probiotics and also your experience with

2291
01:44:18,981 --> 01:44:23,981
antibiotics from recovering from staph 
infection and how devastating was to 

2292
01:44:23,981 --> 01:44:27,911
your immune system.
I started going down the rabbit hole 

2293
01:44:27,911 --> 01:44:30,761
with a gut bacteria after that because I
just found it so fascinating how long it

2294
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:35,801
took you to recover and how a common 
that experiences from large doses of 

2295
01:44:36,801 --> 01:44:41,801
antibiotics,
how devastating it is to the immune 

2296
01:44:41,801 --> 01:44:44,591
system to overall health wellness per 
the way you feel the way you like,

2297
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:46,520
your mood,
your mood.

2298
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:51,020
So many different effects.
One of the things that I've found when I

2299
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:55,490
was eating a lot of bread and pasta is 
that I would have a good meal,

2300
01:44:55,640 --> 01:45:00,640
like say I would have like chicken with 
maybe some vegetables or something like 

2301
01:45:01,191 --> 01:45:06,191
that,
a nice big healthy meal and I would 

2302
01:45:06,191 --> 01:45:07,100
still be hungry afterwards for sugar.
I would like my body.

2303
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:09,710
I was stuffed like I ate like half a 
chicken.

2304
01:45:09,711 --> 01:45:12,320
I'll eat a half a chicken and my body 
was like,

2305
01:45:12,321 --> 01:45:14,480
we need a cookie.
I need a cookie.

2306
01:45:14,481 --> 01:45:15,620
Come on man.
Give me a cookie.

2307
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,510
Like I need some ice cream.
There was,

2308
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:22,570
there was,
there was some gut bacteria craving and 

2309
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:24,050
that's what it seemed like.
It seemed like some bizarre craving.

2310
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:27,260
It wasn't a craving like I needed more 
calories.

2311
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:29,780
Where were you eating these?
Like was this.

2312
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:32,870
Would you typically eat something that's
refined sugar?

2313
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:33,470
Yes.
Oh,

2314
01:45:33,471 --> 01:45:33,890
okay.
Well,

2315
01:45:33,891 --> 01:45:34,220
yeah.
Well,

2316
01:45:34,221 --> 01:45:39,221
something.
This is an interesting effect and sorry 

2317
01:45:39,221 --> 01:45:42,701
if I cut you off,
but something that does happen when you 

2318
01:45:42,701 --> 01:45:43,870
eat refined sugars,
like something,

2319
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:49,210
not a piece of fruit which has the fiber
matrix and all these polyphenols.

2320
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:51,800
By the way,
polyphenols are plant insecticides.

2321
01:45:51,801 --> 01:45:53,960
It's all we were talking about has all 
this other good stuff.

2322
01:45:54,230 --> 01:45:56,660
When you take the refined sugar away 
from that,

2323
01:45:58,130 --> 01:46:03,130
what happens is when your your gut,
so your gut digest it and it refined 

2324
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:09,041
sugar usually is like a glucose mol.
It's 50 percent glucose and 50 percent 

2325
01:46:09,041 --> 01:46:13,751
fructose,
and that's sucrose and that's what's in 

2326
01:46:13,751 --> 01:46:15,610
table.
Sugar is what's in a lot of refined 

2327
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:17,111
sugars and what happens is that when you
cleave the sucrose in the end,

2328
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:19,970
you cleaned the sucrose to this glucose 
and the fructose,

2329
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:23,570
the fruit toast itself doesn't get 
absorbed by all the cells.

2330
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:26,960
It only gets metabolized in the liver 
and it does something.

2331
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:32,020
It's called ATP trapping.
So what it does is it traps ATP,

2332
01:46:32,991 --> 01:46:37,991
which is the source of energy,
and it does this because it's trying to 

2333
01:46:37,991 --> 01:46:38,120
like do this whole other complicated 
enzymatic reaction,

2334
01:46:38,330 --> 01:46:38,770
blah,
blah,

2335
01:46:38,771 --> 01:46:39,290
blah.
Right?

2336
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:44,560
But what it does is trap the ATP and 
this sends a signal through the vagal 

2337
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,370
nerve to your brain.
I don't have energy,

2338
01:46:46,371 --> 01:46:50,310
and so you don't get satiated.
And so when you eat refined sugars,

2339
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:56,230
and this is independent from the gut 
bacteria craving stuff you're talking 

2340
01:46:56,230 --> 01:46:56,370
about,
I'm not exactly sure how all that works,

2341
01:46:56,371 --> 01:47:01,370
but what I'm talking about is real.
It's ATP trapping and it's.

2342
01:47:01,371 --> 01:47:02,040
It's,
it's,

2343
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:05,940
it's something that is known to be a 
cause of y.

2344
01:47:05,941 --> 01:47:09,930
You can eat a bunch of fructose and 
refined sugar and not be satiated,

2345
01:47:09,931 --> 01:47:12,120
and so you have to eat more because your
body,

2346
01:47:12,121 --> 01:47:16,200
your brain thinks you haven't been fed 
because the APP has been trapped.

2347
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:19,920
It's called ATP trapping.
That's one possibility that could be,

2348
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,200
could have been happening.
It's really,

2349
01:47:22,201 --> 01:47:27,201
it's also why a lot of people that eat a
lot of refined sugars with sucrose or 

2350
01:47:27,201 --> 01:47:29,430
high fructose corn syrup is the worst 
when they eat that.

2351
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:31,440
Why is high fructose Corn Syrup to 
worse?

2352
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:35,130
Because then so when your gut,
so the way your gut.

2353
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:35,970
Okay,
let's just.

2354
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,630
Let's compare table sugar.
Sucrose or high fructose corn syrup.

2355
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,630
Both are bad,
but when you compare the two,

2356
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:47,280
because sucrose is got,
it's got glucose.

2357
01:47:47,281 --> 01:47:50,340
I mean it's got glucose and fructose,
high fructose corn syrup does to you.

2358
01:47:50,341 --> 01:47:52,390
It has more fructose,
but the thing is,

2359
01:47:52,391 --> 01:47:53,350
is that,
um,

2360
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,680
when it,
when the sucrose sees your gut,

2361
01:47:55,681 --> 01:47:57,900
your gut has something in it called sue 
crazes,

2362
01:47:58,230 --> 01:47:59,730
which clique,
which it takes,

2363
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:04,760
basically it's,
it's slower to cleave and digest the 

2364
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:06,820
sugar,
so it's not like a big bolus at your gut

2365
01:48:06,821 --> 01:48:11,821
sees,
so it's not as irritating on the gut 

2366
01:48:11,821 --> 01:48:14,390
because it has the first,
the suit crazes have to cleave the suit 

2367
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,390
gross and so like all this stuff is 
happening.

2368
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:16,050
Whereas when you get the high fructose 
corn syrup,

2369
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:19,110
that doesn't happen.
It's a big bolus and it's like,

2370
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:23,400
it literally like causes a breakdown in 
your gut barrier.

2371
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:25,200
It's like irritant.
It's an irritant.

2372
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:27,840
The same thing can happen if you take 
too much of,

2373
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:30,660
um,
I mean there's lots of other things that

2374
01:48:30,661 --> 01:48:35,661
happen,
but if you take too much like magnesium 

2375
01:48:35,661 --> 01:48:35,661
or something,
people can get gut irritation.

2376
01:48:35,661 --> 01:48:39,930
It's a big bolus on the gut and it's 
irritant and that's what high fructose 

2377
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:42,831
corn syrup does.
And there's also then the whole atp 

2378
01:48:42,831 --> 01:48:44,280
trapping thing is like exponential with 
high fructose corn syrup,

2379
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,320
fructose.
It's compounded.

2380
01:48:46,321 --> 01:48:48,690
There's a bunch of different factors.
There's a bunch of different factors.

2381
01:48:48,691 --> 01:48:53,691
Of course,
the fructose is very different in fruit 

2382
01:48:53,691 --> 01:48:53,691
because the matrix,
the fiber,

2383
01:48:53,691 --> 01:48:54,990
it's digested differently.
It's.

2384
01:48:54,991 --> 01:48:59,520
It's completely different than taking a 
table sugar or high fructose corn syrup.

2385
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:02,280
Who's the monster that extracted that 
stuff?

2386
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:05,880
I mean,
it's so bad windows that done.

2387
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,300
When do they figure out how to do that?
I mean they used to do cane sugar rose.

2388
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:11,610
I don't know.
I don't know.

2389
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:15,090
I know there's people that are super 
into to all that stuff,

2390
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:16,350
but yeah,
it's cheaper.

2391
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:19,440
That's why it's cheaper and it's hidden.
It's in everything.

2392
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:24,120
If you go out and go to a Chili's and 
think they're going to eat healthy,

2393
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:26,700
you order a salad and there's like 60 
grams of sugar in there.

2394
01:49:26,701 --> 01:49:29,340
Waldorf Salad because it's all in the 
dressing.

2395
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,510
High Fructose Corn Syrup.
That's insane.

2396
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,610
Okay.
Here it is.

2397
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:37,850
The 1970.
It was first introduced to food and 

2398
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:40,581
beverage industry of high fructose corn 
Syrup was first introduced to the food 

2399
01:49:40,581 --> 01:49:42,210
and beverage industry in the 19 
seventies.

2400
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:46,440
That's amazing that that stuff from 1970
until today,

2401
01:49:46,441 --> 01:49:51,441
so in the the last 40 plus years has 
become a massive part of our diets.

2402
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:58,290
The average this was published and it 
was like the Health Organization and 

2403
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:01,360
somewhere in the UK and whatever they 
call that.

2404
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:06,580
There were some health organization and 
UK that that did a press release and 

2405
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:09,730
said that the average five-year-old 
consumes 50 grams of sugar a day.

2406
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:11,440
Oh my God.
Sorry.

2407
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:16,770
Yeah,
50 grams to 50 grams a day or that 50 

2408
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:17,950
grand a year and two grams a day.
That's 50 grams a day.

2409
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:20,790
Which was their weight.
It was okay.

2410
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,000
Now I'm remembering it was.
Yeah,

2411
01:50:22,001 --> 01:50:23,800
it would be awesome.
It was 50 grams a day,

2412
01:50:23,801 --> 01:50:26,500
which was the average of their entire 
body weight.

2413
01:50:26,790 --> 01:50:29,020
Have a five year old a year,
a year,

2414
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:32,230
so if you have a bag of sugar the size 
of a five year old,

2415
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:34,540
five year old eat that in the year.
Exactly.

2416
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:39,541
She's and I did some calculations that 
comes out to like a pumpkin spice latte 

2417
01:50:39,541 --> 01:50:40,990
at starbucks which has like 64 grams of 
sugar.

2418
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:45,100
It's,
it's crazy and everything.

2419
01:50:47,050 --> 01:50:49,630
There's a particular type of gut 
bacteria,

2420
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:52,540
they crave sugar and that thrives on 
sugar though,

2421
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:54,090
isn't there?
Um,

2422
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,160
you know,
yeast are surviving on sugar,

2423
01:50:57,161 --> 01:50:58,880
but they're not gut bacteria.
You're,

2424
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:01,110
there was like a,
a documentary,

2425
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:06,130
an online thing that I watched on the 
various documentary on different gut 

2426
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:08,320
bacteria,
so that attracted to,

2427
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:10,450
so I don't,
maybe this is,

2428
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:15,990
I know that so that your gut bacteria 
with what they eat is fiber and they're 

2429
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:18,670
mostly in your colon.
And so when you're,

2430
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:21,500
when you eat fiber deficient diet,
um,

2431
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,050
proteins,
lipids,

2432
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:26,470
sugars are all absorbed in the upper 
intestine,

2433
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:31,500
but your,
your bacteria in your gut starve and in 

2434
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:35,371
order to stop themselves from starving,
they start to cannibalize the gut 

2435
01:51:35,371 --> 01:51:36,910
barrier that they live on because it's 
got carbohydrates.

2436
01:51:36,911 --> 01:51:41,911
And so low fiber diet can cause massive 
gut barrier breakdown.

2437
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:44,410
It's actually the most in terms of 
magnitude,

2438
01:51:44,411 --> 01:51:46,830
the most potent thing that regulates gut
health is fiber.

2439
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:48,940
So is that like irritable bowel 
syndrome,

2440
01:51:48,941 --> 01:51:50,400
things along those lines?
Well,

2441
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:52,300
that can,
that can happen,

2442
01:51:52,301 --> 01:51:57,301
but you don't have to have irritable 
bowel syndrome to have your gut barrier 

2443
01:51:57,301 --> 01:51:57,301
breaking down.
You know,

2444
01:51:57,301 --> 01:51:59,110
you can have a low level of 
inflammation,

2445
01:51:59,111 --> 01:52:04,111
not know it,
but there are certain types of bacteria 

2446
01:52:04,111 --> 01:52:08,880
that can thrive in the condition.
Now maybe that maybe let's say you have 

2447
01:52:09,011 --> 01:52:14,011
a low fiber diet,
meaning you're eating a lot of refined 

2448
01:52:14,011 --> 01:52:14,170
sugar,
so it's Kinda like the same,

2449
01:52:14,171 --> 01:52:19,171
right?
You're eating a bunch of refined sugar 

2450
01:52:19,171 --> 01:52:19,270
and in place of plants and fiber rich 
foods,

2451
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:24,750
there's a certain type of bacteria that 
can thrive on low fiber and it's a type 

2452
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:25,080
of bacteria,
I don't know the name of,

2453
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:28,210
but they have little flagella things 
that like move,

2454
01:52:28,211 --> 01:52:29,880
you know,
sperm sperm it.

2455
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:30,880
Yeah,
exactly like that.

2456
01:52:30,881 --> 01:52:35,881
And so they'll like swim up.
So your bacteria are supposed to be in 

2457
01:52:35,881 --> 01:52:35,881
the colon,
let very,

2458
01:52:35,881 --> 01:52:37,390
very end of your intestines.
Right?

2459
01:52:38,170 --> 01:52:43,170
They're not supposed to be.
You're not supposed to have a bunch of 

2460
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:44,761
bacteria in your small intestine will.
They'll swim up to the small intestine 

2461
01:52:44,761 --> 01:52:48,541
because that's where the food,
that's where the and the sugars and the 

2462
01:52:48,541 --> 01:52:51,410
lipids are all getting absorbed.
They'll swim up there and this is often 

2463
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:54,851
referred to as bacterial overgrowth.
Small intestine bacterial overgrowth is 

2464
01:52:55,011 --> 01:53:00,011
what the technical term is,
bacterial overgrowth is actually when 

2465
01:53:00,011 --> 01:53:02,711
your bacteria are starting to grow in 
your small intestine and what happens is

2466
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,900
when you have bacteria in your small 
intestine,

2467
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:11,200
it releases something called Zonulin and
this work has all been done by Eliseo 

2468
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:17,500
Fasano and he's,
I think he's at like Massachusetts 

2469
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:17,660
Children Hospital and he discovered this
so you know,

2470
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:19,130
he's a rockstar for figuring this stuff 
out,

2471
01:53:19,131 --> 01:53:24,131
but so when you have this,
this intestinal overgrowth released 

2472
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:24,131
something called Zonulin.

2473
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:26,300
Zonulin is also,
which are released when gluten,

2474
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:29,820
when your body sees gluten Zonulin,
um,

2475
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:35,050
it literally,
like you have the gut barrier and 

2476
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:35,050
there's like these junctions with the 
barrier,

2477
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:36,980
it opens up the junctions,
the tight junctions,

2478
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:40,910
and then people that don't have like 
Celiac or they don't have a really,

2479
01:53:40,911 --> 01:53:42,800
really poor gut health.
It closed.

2480
01:53:42,801 --> 01:53:44,360
It's like a transients like open,
close,

2481
01:53:44,630 --> 01:53:45,200
open,
close.

2482
01:53:45,201 --> 01:53:50,201
And so when they open,
your inflammatory cells can see the 

2483
01:53:50,201 --> 01:53:53,171
bacteria that's there.
Usually the barrier separates them 

2484
01:53:53,171 --> 01:53:56,411
because what did,
what do immune cells do when they see 

2485
01:53:56,411 --> 01:53:59,771
bacteria fire away?
More so the small intestinal bacterial 

2486
01:54:00,921 --> 01:54:05,921
overgrowth does that and so does,
so gluten gluten also causes Zonulin to 

2487
01:54:05,921 --> 01:54:06,290
be released,
but um,

2488
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:10,400
so that would cause like bloating and 
inflammation,

2489
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:11,750
you know,
things like that.

2490
01:54:12,670 --> 01:54:13,620
Wow.
God,

2491
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:18,640
it's just so.
It's so crazy how much your diet 

2492
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:22,390
actually affects your overall health and
how few people really consider it when 

2493
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:27,221
they're thinking about what they're 
eating and the consequences of what 

2494
01:54:27,221 --> 01:54:27,370
they're eating and your brain,
what tastes good and your brand.

2495
01:54:27,650 --> 01:54:29,230
If it's,
you know,

2496
01:54:29,390 --> 01:54:33,140
having low inflammation is key for your 
brain.

2497
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:36,200
All these different factors that are 
playing on inside your body.

2498
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,720
Like all this stuff.
I know.

2499
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:39,340
Yeah.
No,

2500
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:44,440
I'm eating a diet that's high in fiber.
That's one of the reasons why I 

2501
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:49,091
actually,
I eat a lot of wide diversity because 

2502
01:54:49,091 --> 01:54:49,700
there's lots of different types of 
fiber.

2503
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:52,310
There's you fibers,
not just like one nutrient,

2504
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:53,480
you know,
people always treat at me,

2505
01:54:53,481 --> 01:54:54,350
oh,
can I take Pectin,

2506
01:54:54,351 --> 01:54:56,570
can I,
can I take insulin and you know,

2507
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:57,980
which is a type of fiber.
And it's like,

2508
01:54:57,981 --> 01:55:00,110
well yeah you can,
but you know,

2509
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:05,200
these different types of bacteria.
So many different types of bacteria and 

2510
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:08,560
they are,
they're eating different types of fiber 

2511
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:08,840
and we don't even know all what each of 
them are eating.

2512
01:55:08,841 --> 01:55:13,841
We just,
we know the best thing we can do right 

2513
01:55:13,841 --> 01:55:13,841
now is to get a broad spectrum,
you know,

2514
01:55:13,841 --> 01:55:17,040
so there's fiber in the implants,
there's fiber that are called leggins 

2515
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:17,060
and cellulose.

2516
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,600
I'm in fruits,
there's pectins like apple,

2517
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:23,510
a citrus appeal,
have pectins,

2518
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,090
Beta glucans are and mushrooms.
They're an oats,

2519
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:29,450
I'm resistant starches in legumes,
beans.

2520
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:33,020
There's inulin which is in plants and 
off like onions,

2521
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:34,400
artichokes,
garlic,

2522
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:36,290
and all these different types of fiber 
feeding,

2523
01:55:36,291 --> 01:55:41,291
different types of factor.
And that best thing you want is a 

2524
01:55:41,291 --> 01:55:43,391
diverse bacteria set.
So feeding them all different types of 

2525
01:55:43,391 --> 01:55:43,391
fibers.
Good.

2526
01:55:43,391 --> 01:55:47,050
Plus you're getting all the plant 
hormetic compounds and then you're 

2527
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:47,050
getting all the micronutrients,
magnesium,

2528
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:48,970
vitaminK ,
I'm fully,

2529
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:50,550
you know,
these are things that people are in,

2530
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:51,870
are deficient in.
So I,

2531
01:55:51,970 --> 01:55:53,850
I,
I try to do that and then I eat meat.

2532
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:55,660
I think there was a,
uh,

2533
01:55:55,710 --> 01:55:56,360
it was,
uh,

2534
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:58,110
uh,
now that I'm thinking about it,

2535
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:00,170
I think it was kind of like an 
infomercial,

2536
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:02,730
what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the candida videos.

2537
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:07,731
Yes,
that's exactly what they're selling a 

2538
01:56:07,731 --> 01:56:07,731
product,
but I don't think I made it that far.

2539
01:56:07,731 --> 01:56:08,980
It was long.
Five minutes.

2540
01:56:09,070 --> 01:56:14,070
Yeah,
it was really long and it was 

2541
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:14,070
disturbing.
You know,

2542
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:15,390
you're talking about Candida growth in 
your stomach and how your,

2543
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,620
your,
your gut is responding to all this sugar

2544
01:56:18,621 --> 01:56:22,160
by this massive production of or 
massive.

2545
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:24,110
Here it is.
So that's what happened.

2546
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:25,940
Sugar,
the cause of Candida,

2547
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:30,500
Candida cause of cancer.
And sugar has been shown,

2548
01:56:30,501 --> 01:56:32,360
right,
to accelerate cancer growth.

2549
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:37,570
Yes.
In fact that there was a study that was 

2550
01:56:37,570 --> 01:56:40,691
just published recently were like caused
breast cancer cells to grow like four 

2551
01:56:40,691 --> 01:56:40,940
times faster.

2552
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:44,130
Whoa.
Four times faster from sugar.

2553
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:48,060
Refined sugar.
Not from my wife's mom.

2554
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:51,000
She's a lovely lady,
but she loves sugar.

2555
01:56:51,001 --> 01:56:54,150
She puts sugar in everything.
She makes Kale Salad and you eat it.

2556
01:56:54,151 --> 01:56:55,230
You'll like,
you're eating candy,

2557
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,760
like everything has sugar.
Like,

2558
01:56:56,761 --> 01:56:58,560
you know,
it's like from her era,

2559
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:00,990
that's what they did.
They put sugar in their cornflakes,

2560
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:04,110
everybody would sugar and everything and
they felt like it just made things taste

2561
01:57:04,111 --> 01:57:09,111
good.
Like you're eating healthy food and 

2562
01:57:09,111 --> 01:57:09,111
skittles,
sugar on it,

2563
01:57:09,111 --> 01:57:12,460
you know,
spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go 

2564
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:12,460
down.
Remember that?

2565
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:12,460
Yes.
You know,

2566
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:16,731
and it's just,
it's so disturbing that people grow up 

2567
01:57:16,731 --> 01:57:18,570
thinking that this is the way to eat and
it just.

2568
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:21,090
Nobody told them,
nobody warned them and you know,

2569
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:24,720
she's in her sixties now and that's just
how it goes to the autonomous.

2570
01:57:24,721 --> 01:57:27,380
It's hard to God,
it's fucking

2571
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:28,160
people.
Yeah.

2572
01:57:28,161 --> 01:57:29,670
I've got,
I've got loved member,

2573
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:34,880
loved ones that I care about that are 
also addicted to sugar and I try try 

2574
01:57:35,511 --> 01:57:36,830
hard.
It's,

2575
01:57:36,850 --> 01:57:37,730
it's,
it is hard.

2576
01:57:37,731 --> 01:57:40,580
Especially the older you get when you're
stuck in your ways,

2577
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:44,150
your brain's not as able to kind of 
change as easily,

2578
01:57:44,151 --> 01:57:44,890
you know?
So we'll see.

2579
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:44,990
So you

2580
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:50,010
don't have a lot of willpower.
Some people just not good at like 

2581
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:50,010
saying,
okay,

2582
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:51,040
this is what,
I'm not doing this anymore,

2583
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,130
you know,
like this,

2584
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:53,620
I'm done doing that.
Boom,

2585
01:57:53,890 --> 01:57:58,890
you know,
I don't know how other people's brains 

2586
01:57:58,890 --> 01:57:58,890
work,
so I don't.

2587
01:57:58,890 --> 01:58:02,191
I don't know what the pull is,
but I know for me when when I try to 

2588
01:58:02,191 --> 01:58:02,960
quit something like I'm going to quit 
sugar,

2589
01:58:02,961 --> 01:58:03,760
I'm there.
Boy,

2590
01:58:03,761 --> 01:58:07,930
that fucking first week or so.
It was hard because the pole,

2591
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:10,630
it's like there's this desire to cheap 
go.

2592
01:58:10,631 --> 01:58:12,060
Come on man,
one cookies,

2593
01:58:12,070 --> 01:58:14,350
not going to fuck anything up.
It's not going to be that big a deal.

2594
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:18,670
Like there's this poll to have sugar and
when I kicked sugar for,

2595
01:58:18,820 --> 01:58:21,100
I've done it twice now,
but the first time I did it,

2596
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:23,230
one of the most disturbing things,
it was like the headaches,

2597
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:25,570
like two or three days in I was getting 
these headaches.

2598
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:26,830
I was like,
Oh my God,

2599
01:58:27,070 --> 01:58:30,520
I'm getting sugar detox headaches.
Like that's what it was.

2600
01:58:30,521 --> 01:58:35,521
It had to be.
There was the only thing that was 

2601
01:58:35,521 --> 01:58:35,521
different.
I was eating all the same normal things,

2602
01:58:35,521 --> 01:58:36,400
but I wasn't taking any sugar.
Anything that has sugar,

2603
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:41,580
I wouldn't take it and I was getting 
headaches it on most people if you don't

2604
01:58:42,281 --> 01:58:47,281
get,
if you don't have a rock solid 

2605
01:58:47,281 --> 01:58:48,400
determined mentality for this type of 
stuff,

2606
01:58:48,430 --> 01:58:51,670
it's really hard.
Like if you're wishy washy on your diet.

2607
01:58:51,671 --> 01:58:52,990
Well I'm just going to try to eat 
healthy.

2608
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:55,540
Like my friends have told me that before
they try to lose weight.

2609
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:57,670
What are you doing?
I'm just going to try to eat healthier.

2610
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,010
You Ain't gonna do shit.
You Ain't gonna do shit.

2611
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:02,710
Like you have to have like a rigid set 
of rules.

2612
01:59:02,711 --> 01:59:07,711
You can't say I'm just going to eat 
healthy because then you'll decide 

2613
01:59:07,711 --> 01:59:11,641
you're eating healthy back fucking 
cupcake's not gonna hurt anybody and 

2614
01:59:11,641 --> 01:59:12,100
then you'll eat that cupcake and that'll
kill all your hard work.

2615
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:16,780
I had no idea that you were eating 
refined sugar like this whole time.

2616
01:59:16,781 --> 01:59:20,590
I thought you were.
You're always like vegetables.

2617
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,170
Meat.
Yeah.

2618
01:59:22,190 --> 01:59:24,220
I would occasionally I would dive in.
I mean,

2619
01:59:24,221 --> 01:59:29,221
it wasn't like a real problem,
but it was enough that see if you eat 

2620
01:59:29,221 --> 01:59:30,970
protein bars like the ones that Jamie 
was eating over there,

2621
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,010
what does that have it?
I love those goddamn things.

2622
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:37,000
These things are great.
They taste awesome.

2623
01:59:37,001 --> 01:59:42,001
They're called pro bars.
I first found out about these suckers 

2624
01:59:42,001 --> 01:59:42,001
one-on-one.
A hunting.

2625
01:59:42,001 --> 01:59:42,400
Oh,
come on.

2626
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:45,850
Is that real?
This fucker is 21 grams of sugar in it.

2627
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:48,650
This is crazy.
Yeah,

2628
01:59:48,690 --> 01:59:49,900
that's what I'm saying.
It's everywhere.

2629
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:52,660
It's hidden everywhere.
That is.

2630
01:59:52,730 --> 01:59:56,170
God damn crazy.
This is 21 grams.

2631
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:58,060
You're always supposed to have 25 in a 
day.

2632
01:59:58,080 --> 01:59:59,080
Yep,
exactly.

2633
01:59:59,081 --> 02:00:04,081
A whole day.
One yummy bar fucker is Alex your added 

2634
02:00:05,801 --> 02:00:08,410
sugar fighting two or three of those in 
a setting.

2635
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:10,780
Like after I worked out,
I would eat two of those.

2636
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:13,870
Like if I was going to in the morning,
if I was headed over here and uh,

2637
02:00:13,871 --> 02:00:17,230
I didn't have time to eat,
I'd throw to those down and a Kombucha.

2638
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:20,020
So the Kombucha,
John Ten 10?

2639
02:00:20,021 --> 02:00:21,520
Yeah.
For grape grape cappuccinos.

2640
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:23,890
10 plane has five.
So,

2641
02:00:23,891 --> 02:00:25,130
uh,
I prefer plane,

2642
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:26,920
but sometimes the grape was all.

2643
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:31,920
I had left,
so I'd throw it out a grape that's 10 a 

2644
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:31,920
throw down,
two of those.

2645
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,610
That's 41 or 42.
Jesus Christ,

2646
02:00:33,611 --> 02:00:36,550
I mean 50 grams of sugar on the way over
here,

2647
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:38,710
which is twice what you're supposed to 
have in a day.

2648
02:00:38,830 --> 02:00:41,380
And then I might have a piece of cake,
you know,

2649
02:00:41,381 --> 02:00:44,750
I'm to eat real healthy and say I'm 
eating real healthy and you know,

2650
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:48,070
oh you want some apple pie folk?
Do you want ice cream on it?

2651
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:49,960
Why not?
And then what's that?

2652
02:00:49,961 --> 02:00:51,970
It's probably another 30,
40,

2653
02:00:51,971 --> 02:00:52,930
50,
60,

2654
02:00:52,931 --> 02:00:56,980
70.
So you're winding up with 100 plus grams

2655
02:00:57,160 --> 02:00:59,290
of sugar in a day,
right?

2656
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:00,100
Yeah.
And this,

2657
02:01:00,130 --> 02:01:05,130
this,
this stuff is causing inflammation in 

2658
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:05,130
your gut.
It's the more,

2659
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:09,301
at least with you,
you were still getting some of the good 

2660
02:01:09,301 --> 02:01:11,161
stuff though.
It's not like you were eating a fiber 

2661
02:01:11,161 --> 02:01:11,161
deficient diet.
Yeah.

2662
02:01:11,161 --> 02:01:11,740
No,
I was eating healthy on top of that,

2663
02:01:11,770 --> 02:01:13,660
but even better than.
Yeah.

2664
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:15,880
Than most people that are eating that 
stuff.

2665
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:19,540
This is crazy.
It's crazy.

2666
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:22,120
It's crazy.
There's a thing called a Lara bar.

2667
02:01:22,130 --> 02:01:23,260
You ever heard lar?
A.

2668
02:01:23,261 --> 02:01:25,180
They're so yummy,
they're so good,

2669
02:01:25,181 --> 02:01:26,950
but it makes it look like you're eating 
something healthy.

2670
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:30,970
It's like the wrappings earth toned.
It's like woo.

2671
02:01:30,971 --> 02:01:33,010
I'm like,
I'm doing yoga in a bar.

2672
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:38,220
This is.
Most of those bars are really candy 

2673
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:38,220
bars,
you know.

2674
02:01:38,780 --> 02:01:40,400
I think quest nutrition

2675
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:45,460
is probably like,
if I were to say that there's anyone 

2676
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,640
that makes,
makes a bar that's not a candy bar.

2677
02:01:46,641 --> 02:01:49,070
Quest quest has some decent ones.

2678
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:49,860
Well,
um,

2679
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:54,900
primal kitchens has a really good one.
It's a nut bar with dark chocolate and 

2680
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:58,960
it has a tiny amount of honey in it.
It's less than four grams.

2681
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:02,650
I'm pretty sure less than four grams of 
sugar per bar,

2682
02:02:02,890 --> 02:02:05,650
but it's mostly almonds and dark 
chocolate.

2683
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:07,900
Like a little bit of honey.
Those are really good.

2684
02:02:07,930 --> 02:02:09,730
They're not,
it's not sweet at all.

2685
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:14,680
Those I liked those and a lot of times 
I'll eat like a meat bars.

2686
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:17,050
Like there's some bars.
What are the ones we have back there?

2687
02:02:17,051 --> 02:02:17,810
Those.
Yeah.

2688
02:02:17,870 --> 02:02:19,540
One of those ones we have in the back.
Jamie,

2689
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:20,790
what are those things?
Quite.

2690
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:21,970
Yeah.
Well,

2691
02:02:21,971 --> 02:02:23,620
not just the ones that we sell it on it 
with.

2692
02:02:23,621 --> 02:02:27,760
Those other ones that I bought about 
some other ones that are really good,

2693
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:30,310
but even some of those have fucking 
sugar in them.

2694
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:33,550
It's just amazing how sneaky they are.
That God damn sure

2695
02:02:33,670 --> 02:02:35,540
didn't condiments.
It's in hot sauces.

2696
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:37,170
Yeah.
These things right here.

2697
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:39,750
So these fuckers,
this is so,

2698
02:02:39,751 --> 02:02:40,680
this.
I got these

2699
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,350
damn things.
He's Paleo.

2700
02:02:42,351 --> 02:02:47,351
Simplified them like all go paleo bar 
bullshit.

2701
02:02:48,190 --> 02:02:53,190
It's got a lot of God damn sugar in all 
these fucking things of 15 or 19 or.

2702
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:54,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

2703
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:56,930
This one is 20 Jesus Christ.

2704
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:00,430
The uh,
the lab that I was doing my postdoc in,

2705
02:03:00,490 --> 02:03:01,060
they,
they,

2706
02:03:01,170 --> 02:03:02,270
I've talked about this before.
They,

2707
02:03:02,271 --> 02:03:03,370
they,
they made it,

2708
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:08,410
they designed a bard intentionally to 
try and fill new micro nutrient gaps in 

2709
02:03:08,410 --> 02:03:10,700
people that are like obese.
So like it has,

2710
02:03:10,701 --> 02:03:12,210
it has vitamin D in it,
you know,

2711
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:15,350
it has magnesium,
vitaminK has Dha,

2712
02:03:15,351 --> 02:03:20,351
Omega three,
it has all these good micronutrients in 

2713
02:03:20,351 --> 02:03:22,421
it and then they try to put some dark 
chocolate so that doesn't taste like 

2714
02:03:22,421 --> 02:03:22,421
crap.
Um,

2715
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:25,940
and sprinkle a little bit.
There's very little sugar in it,

2716
02:03:25,941 --> 02:03:28,160
but you know people don't like them 
because they don't taste good.

2717
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:32,350
This little fucker as 22,
this little crazy you shouldn't eat.

2718
02:03:32,351 --> 02:03:36,180
That disappears in my hand.
This little tiny thing is 22.

2719
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:38,060
Imagine how many people are eating this 
stuff.

2720
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:43,400
Sugar just fucks.
I think the best thing you can do is eat

2721
02:03:43,790 --> 02:03:44,660
whole foods.

2722
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:46,550
You can eat vegetables,
you know,

2723
02:03:46,551 --> 02:03:49,190
fruits are not that bad.
You can eat a pear and apple.

2724
02:03:49,191 --> 02:03:51,590
You can eat berries,
strawberries,

2725
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:56,800
all these things they have.
They have a variety of different good 

2726
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:56,800
polyphenols.
These plant insecticides,

2727
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:00,080
they've got fiber,
they've got some micronutrients and they

2728
02:04:00,081 --> 02:04:02,840
taste really good.
They taste good like a peach,

2729
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:04,940
a really good peach.
Oh my God.

2730
02:04:04,941 --> 02:04:07,430
They're delicious and it's something 
that we've gotten,

2731
02:04:07,431 --> 02:04:09,620
so we.
We've just gotten so used to it.

2732
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:11,410
We'll take it for granted.
You know,

2733
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:13,850
if you had a desert and it tastes like a
delicious peach,

2734
02:04:13,851 --> 02:04:14,470
you'd be like,
Ooh,

2735
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:17,260
this is a wonderful dessert because it's
a peach,

2736
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:19,600
like it's good for you.
Yeah.

2737
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:22,610
It's almost like we want that bad for 
you.

2738
02:04:22,670 --> 02:04:27,670
Rush.
It's like were naughty on top of the 

2739
02:04:27,670 --> 02:04:27,740
fact that we're,
we're eating something,

2740
02:04:27,741 --> 02:04:32,741
we're getting like the mouth pleasure 
from it and we're also getting the 

2741
02:04:32,741 --> 02:04:32,741
naughtiness like,
Ooo,

2742
02:04:32,741 --> 02:04:33,110
the cake.

2743
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:36,950
How much of that is a learned response 
as well?

2744
02:04:36,951 --> 02:04:38,450
You know,
my,

2745
02:04:38,650 --> 02:04:43,320
my postdoc advisor or Bruce Ames,
he's 87 years old,

2746
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:48,620
going on 88 and I've been to many 
different dinner parties at his house 

2747
02:04:48,620 --> 02:04:52,731
and he's American and his wife is 
Italian so she immigrated here from 

2748
02:04:52,731 --> 02:04:57,021
Italy.
But every single time I go to a dinner 

2749
02:04:57,021 --> 02:05:00,861
party the dessert is always fresh fruit.
I mean it's just like super normal,

2750
02:05:00,901 --> 02:05:02,550
like it's,
it's always fresh.

2751
02:05:02,551 --> 02:05:07,551
Some sort of fresh fruit medley.
She'll cut up and sometimes she'll put 

2752
02:05:07,551 --> 02:05:09,120
some little bit of some alcohol or 
something on there.

2753
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:11,430
I'm like,
I'm moretto or you know,

2754
02:05:11,431 --> 02:05:13,470
but it's always fresh fruit and that's 
like,

2755
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:16,560
they've been doing this for 50 years.
That's been their dessert.

2756
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:18,090
Fresh fruit,
you know.

2757
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:20,970
So that was good though.
He's good.

2758
02:05:20,971 --> 02:05:22,650
Chocolate cake is better.
Dark,

2759
02:05:22,660 --> 02:05:27,660
dark chocolate.
Dark chocolate has a lot of good stuff 

2760
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:27,660
in it,
you know?

2761
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:28,440
So that the dark,
dark chocolates.

2762
02:05:28,441 --> 02:05:33,441
One,
I think that people that are really 

2763
02:05:33,441 --> 02:05:33,441
craving that can can feel good because 
there's,

2764
02:05:33,441 --> 02:05:36,390
there's ecg and dark chocolate,
which is what's in green tea.

2765
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:41,660
UGC is one of those normal plant 
compounds that are doing a a hormetic 

2766
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:46,221
response.
It's been shown to cause brain cells to 

2767
02:05:46,221 --> 02:05:46,221
grow.
It's anti cancer,

2768
02:05:46,221 --> 02:05:47,820
it kills cancer cells.
It also is really good for your skin,

2769
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:51,390
prevents your skin.
Collagen is being broken down and it has

2770
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:54,510
a really high reading of antioxidants.
Right?

2771
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:56,430
Well that's what I'm talking about.
These,

2772
02:05:56,630 --> 02:06:01,200
they're not.
People get confused antioxidants.

2773
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:05,970
There are antioxidants in fruits and 
vegetables,

2774
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:11,390
but in dark chocolate,
the antioxidants are the hormetic 

2775
02:06:11,390 --> 02:06:15,051
compounds that are causing your 
antioxidant genes to be expressed is a 

2776
02:06:15,051 --> 02:06:17,640
big difference and there's really like,
there's no comparison.

2777
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:19,500
Like if you're,
you know,

2778
02:06:19,501 --> 02:06:22,260
you need a certain amount of vitamin E 
which has antioxidant,

2779
02:06:22,261 --> 02:06:25,970
you need a certain amount of vitamin C 
which is an antioxidant and a cofactor.

2780
02:06:26,030 --> 02:06:30,720
You need it to make Collagen,
but in just like the antioxidant form,

2781
02:06:30,721 --> 02:06:33,840
it pales in comparison to like 
glutathione related enzymes.

2782
02:06:33,841 --> 02:06:38,841
We have super oxide dismutase.
All these systems that we have in our 

2783
02:06:38,841 --> 02:06:43,071
body that are designed to prevent these 
things called oxidation or oxidative 

2784
02:06:43,741 --> 02:06:45,000
stress,
stress from happening.

2785
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:47,550
So when you're taking,
in fact some people,

2786
02:06:47,551 --> 02:06:49,940
um,
they have a uh,

2787
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:54,000
so we have this gene that can use 
glutathione in our body,

2788
02:06:54,001 --> 02:06:59,001
takes the glutathione that we make in 
our body and it puts it to like prevent 

2789
02:06:59,001 --> 02:07:03,210
damage from happening to ourselves.
There are people that have more.

2790
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:08,430
I'm more active version of this,
that if they take vitamin D 

2791
02:07:08,430 --> 02:07:08,880
supplemental,
that it actually does them harm.

2792
02:07:09,630 --> 02:07:10,440
Really?
Yeah.

2793
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:13,380
Because that,
because what happens is the body goes,

2794
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:14,730
oh,
I've got this vitamin E,

2795
02:07:14,731 --> 02:07:19,731
it's doing that job.
And so the enzyme doesn't get active 

2796
02:07:19,731 --> 02:07:21,540
when you have the stress there,
the enzymes not active.

2797
02:07:21,830 --> 02:07:26,220
This is a certain gene polymorphism in 
the GSTP one gene.

2798
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:27,670
So how would someone find that out 
there?

2799
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:29,940
What they have to have 23 and me 23 and 
me,

2800
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:35,170
um,
is a genetic test that tests for a 

2801
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:35,910
variety of these polymorphisms.
And um,

2802
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:37,780
there's the,
they give a,

2803
02:07:37,781 --> 02:07:40,840
a report that's kind of,
they don't tell you about that gene.

2804
02:07:40,841 --> 02:07:42,290
You have to like,
um,

2805
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:47,700
you can,
I don't know if promethium promethium 

2806
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:47,770
is,
is a tool that's like it costs $5.

2807
02:07:47,771 --> 02:07:52,771
I've talked about it before in your 
podcast and you can run your 23 and me 

2808
02:07:52,771 --> 02:07:53,710
data through it and it tells you all 
these polymorphisms,

2809
02:07:53,711 --> 02:07:55,660
but that what you have and what they 
mean.

2810
02:07:55,661 --> 02:07:58,030
But I also have a tool that's out today 
actually,

2811
02:07:58,210 --> 02:07:59,620
right?
That's a,

2812
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:01,660
it's a,
it's the Beta version of it,

2813
02:08:01,661 --> 02:08:03,520
so it's,
it's basic functionality,

2814
02:08:03,521 --> 02:08:08,521
but that genes on there,
the GSTP one glitter found one is on 

2815
02:08:08,521 --> 02:08:08,521
there.

2816
02:08:08,521 --> 02:08:08,521
So,
um,

2817
02:08:08,521 --> 02:08:12,760
this tool that I've got out is free so 
people can use it for free and I'm going

2818
02:08:12,761 --> 02:08:15,610
to add a bunch more genes to it,
but right now there's a,

2819
02:08:15,611 --> 02:08:19,270
there's a basic set of genes that are 
interested in genes that are involved in

2820
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:22,790
making vitamin D.
can you convert the vitamin D three?

2821
02:08:22,791 --> 02:08:26,530
You're taking into the steroid hormone 
or vitamin D three you get from the sun.

2822
02:08:26,650 --> 02:08:28,960
Some people have a polymorphism where 
they don't do that as well.

2823
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:30,370
There it is right there,
there it is.

2824
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:33,430
Rhonda is genetic report and this.com
forward slash genetics.

2825
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:39,560
It's amazing to me that every time you 
come on the podcast there's new shit 

2826
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:41,760
that I have to remember and it seems 
like you're constantly learning things.

2827
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:44,640
That's what's crazy is that you've been 
studying this for so long,

2828
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,950
but it's just you're at the tip of the 
iceberg.

2829
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:48,780
It seems like there's no end of this.

2830
02:08:48,990 --> 02:08:52,350
There's no end and we need crispr so 
that I can keep learning.

2831
02:08:52,351 --> 02:08:56,030
It's like infinite amount.
I mean I have

2832
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:57,860
crispr for people don't know what that 
means.

2833
02:08:57,861 --> 02:09:01,730
It's a relatively new method of,
of altering genetic.

2834
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:06,270
I'm going to give the thousand mile 
summary of it where it's basically a way

2835
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:11,580
to to go and fix a gene that may be 
like,

2836
02:09:11,581 --> 02:09:14,130
let's say you've got some gene that you 
can't repair,

2837
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:17,700
you know the alcohol damage induced 
damage as well,

2838
02:09:17,701 --> 02:09:21,120
which also increases the risk for 
traumatic brain injury by like tenfold.

2839
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:23,070
It's bad.
So you say,

2840
02:09:23,071 --> 02:09:28,071
I don't want that apoe e four gene 
because it's gonna lead to Alzheimer's 

2841
02:09:28,071 --> 02:09:31,431
disease.
It's going to make my traumatic brain 

2842
02:09:31,431 --> 02:09:31,431
injury lead to Alzheimer's disease.
You know,

2843
02:09:31,431 --> 02:09:32,940
it's so and also does other things.
Well,

2844
02:09:32,941 --> 02:09:37,941
crispr is a technology that can go and 
recognize the gene you want so it 

2845
02:09:39,201 --> 02:09:42,720
recognize it's just a small sequence of 
DNA that you put on it.

2846
02:09:42,721 --> 02:09:47,721
So you put this little sequence of Dna 
because you know what the sequence of 

2847
02:09:47,721 --> 02:09:49,740
the gene is and it recognizes it's 
complimentary pair and it goes in and it

2848
02:09:49,741 --> 02:09:53,190
cuts it out and it replaces it with what
you actually put there,

2849
02:09:53,191 --> 02:09:58,191
which is the right version of it.
So it can like go cut out a bad thing 

2850
02:09:58,191 --> 02:10:02,061
and put the right thing in.
So it's a way of going instead of gene 

2851
02:10:02,221 --> 02:10:07,221
engineering up until Crispr,
the way it was done was basically you 

2852
02:10:07,221 --> 02:10:11,130
would put a gene in and it will just go 
anywhere and it wouldn't replace the bad

2853
02:10:11,131 --> 02:10:15,180
one necessarily.
So this is Kinda like a whole new field.

2854
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:16,080
It's just like,
it's like.

2855
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:17,550
So anyways.

2856
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:22,650
Yeah.
And there's a radiolab podcast on that 

2857
02:10:22,650 --> 02:10:22,650
as well.
It's spelled C,

2858
02:10:22,650 --> 02:10:23,260
R I s P,
R.

2859
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:25,570
Right.
And if you're interested in listening to

2860
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:30,600
Radiolab podcast,
because it's amazing and it's also 

2861
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:30,600
interviews of people who discovered it.
And.

2862
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:30,980
Right.
Jennifer,

2863
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:32,960
do you see Berkeley?
Yeah,

2864
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:34,010
I listened to some of that.
It's

2865
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:39,010
good.
I think the job really good job 

2866
02:10:39,010 --> 02:10:39,110
explaining it to people so that they can
understand.

2867
02:10:39,370 --> 02:10:44,370
Um,
I want to talk for a little bit about 

2868
02:10:44,370 --> 02:10:46,420
the cryotherapy because this is 
something that I emailed you when there 

2869
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:49,181
was a disturbing article that was sort 
of Poo pooing the benefits cryotherapy 

2870
02:10:49,181 --> 02:10:49,820
in the article was I thought it was 
really poorly,

2871
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:52,280
poorly done,
poorly researched.

2872
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:57,550
And it was also,
it was studied really subjective things 

2873
02:10:57,550 --> 02:11:02,321
like how sore you felt after exercise 
and whether or not a benefited for them 

2874
02:11:02,321 --> 02:11:03,140
from that.
But yeah,

2875
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:08,320
but there are real positive benefits of 
Cryo therapy that are measurable.

2876
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:11,360
Yes.
And that happened as well,

2877
02:11:11,361 --> 02:11:16,361
first of all,
that article that you're referring to 

2878
02:11:16,361 --> 02:11:18,791
from that whatever website it was,
but the article was Steven Novella is a 

2879
02:11:18,861 --> 02:11:23,861
guy and I think what he did is he rushed
to put this article out because that 

2880
02:11:23,861 --> 02:11:27,750
woman died in Las Vegas from Cryo 
therapy and it was a really tragic 

2881
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:27,750
incident.

2882
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:32,350
She was by herself.
There's two different types of cryo 

2883
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:32,350
therapy.
One of the things we should point out,

2884
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:36,730
first of all,
I don't have any because I've been 

2885
02:11:36,730 --> 02:11:38,981
accused of this.
I was just say right now I don't have 

2886
02:11:38,981 --> 02:11:38,981
any vested interest in cryotherapy.
I don't own any of it.

2887
02:11:38,981 --> 02:11:40,640
I don't.
I don't make any money from it.

2888
02:11:40,820 --> 02:11:43,760
Nothing.
I enjoy the benefits of it and I use it,

2889
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:46,850
but this woman who did it,
she did the type.

2890
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,230
There's two kinds.
One of them,

2891
02:11:48,231 --> 02:11:50,990
it goes from the neck down.
So you stand in this booth.

2892
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:53,270
Your head is above breathing and normal 
oxygen,

2893
02:11:53,271 --> 02:11:56,960
but below you is liquid nitrogen.
You can't read that stuff in.

2894
02:11:56,961 --> 02:12:00,200
That's why your head is not under.
If you do breathe that stuff in,

2895
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:05,500
you don't have any oxygen.
You'll black out and that's what 

2896
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:05,500
happened to her.
She did it by herself.

2897
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:10,000
It was poorly set up and apparently she 
was quite short so her head was kind of 

2898
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,190
below the,
the,

2899
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:13,750
the limit where you're supposed to be 
with.

2900
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:17,750
So she was breathing in the liquid 
nitrogen and she fell asleep and blacked

2901
02:12:17,751 --> 02:12:21,760
out.
So I thought she was full on.

2902
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:22,220
No,
no,

2903
02:12:22,221 --> 02:12:25,010
no.
The full on ones are much rarer.

2904
02:12:25,310 --> 02:12:30,080
And what the full on ones do is they 
super cool the air with the nitrogen.

2905
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:33,570
So the air itself is pumped in really 
cool.

2906
02:12:33,650 --> 02:12:34,450
I did.
Yes.

2907
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:39,490
That's what you did.
And that's what we're going to do today 

2908
02:12:39,490 --> 02:12:39,490
too,
if you have the time to.

2909
02:12:39,490 --> 02:12:40,520
Okay,
let's get that one.

2910
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:43,370
You can breathe in.
It's just fucking unbelievably cold.

2911
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:48,640
Okay.
So the one that she did was she set up 

2912
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:48,640
by herself,
which you're never supposed to do.

2913
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:49,220
You're always supposed to have 
supervision.

2914
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:51,230
So it wasn't whether or not.

2915
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:53,870
I mean she's the only person I've ever 
heard of this died from this.

2916
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:56,240
And it's a horrible,
tragic committing suicide.

2917
02:12:56,241 --> 02:12:56,940
No,
no.

2918
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:59,960
She was just worried there.
And sometimes women will,

2919
02:12:59,961 --> 02:13:04,961
um,
they'll put their face under it because 

2920
02:13:04,961 --> 02:13:07,541
they want the effects of a cryo facial 
because cryo facial has been shown to 

2921
02:13:07,971 --> 02:13:10,820
improve Collagen and flattens your 
therapy,

2922
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:15,940
actually prevents it star,
it inhibits enzymes that break down and 

2923
02:13:15,940 --> 02:13:19,830
called college and aces.
And that's actually part of the reason 

2924
02:13:19,830 --> 02:13:22,091
it helps with arthritis.
Arthro college and a's is break down 

2925
02:13:22,091 --> 02:13:22,250
collagen and they break down like,
you know,

2926
02:13:22,251 --> 02:13:24,380
the tendons college and around the 
tendons and stuff.

2927
02:13:24,381 --> 02:13:26,300
And it can cause arthritis,
arthritic pain.

2928
02:13:26,630 --> 02:13:31,630
So doing it would make sense why you'd 
want to do something because it would 

2929
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:32,100
have an effect on your skin.

2930
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:37,160
Yeah.
Women love it when they get their face 

2931
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:39,541
down.
Apparently they get or vein men to or 

2932
02:13:39,541 --> 02:13:39,541
any man,
hello,

2933
02:13:39,541 --> 02:13:43,100
you don't have to be vain to college.
But the point being that article came 

2934
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:43,100
out and all these people were saying,
Oh see,

2935
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:44,760
I told Ya,
cryotherapy was bullshit.

2936
02:13:44,761 --> 02:13:45,540
I'm like,
oh my God,

2937
02:13:45,541 --> 02:13:49,260
what a Piss poor article.
And it was all talking about soreness.

2938
02:13:49,261 --> 02:13:52,300
And one of the things that he said that 
really drove me crazy was you,

2939
02:13:52,370 --> 02:13:57,370
you'd get just as much benefit from a 
cool down and stretch after a workout.

2940
02:13:57,871 --> 02:14:00,420
I'm like,
tell that to these fucking people that I

2941
02:14:00,421 --> 02:14:04,110
see that go there all the time,
that do it twice a day because they have

2942
02:14:04,111 --> 02:14:08,820
severe arthritis and it's the only thing
that's given them any form of,

2943
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:09,990
of,
of freedom,

2944
02:14:09,991 --> 02:14:14,991
of movement of their hands.
Like I know a bunch of people that go 

2945
02:14:14,991 --> 02:14:18,171
there that have had some really 
debilitating arthritis and this has 

2946
02:14:18,171 --> 02:14:21,321
given them a relief where nothing else 
was given it to them other than like 

2947
02:14:21,321 --> 02:14:24,410
pretty severe pharmaceutical drugs or 
Ibuprofen at high levels or what you 

2948
02:14:24,410 --> 02:14:24,410
were talking about.

2949
02:14:24,410 --> 02:14:25,650
Like there's a lady that goes to my 
thing,

2950
02:14:25,651 --> 02:14:29,010
but she was raving about how she can 
finally stretch your hands out.

2951
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:32,250
Like her hands had been like locked in 
this position for years.

2952
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:33,420
Yeah,
it has.

2953
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:38,480
I mean the cold itself as a paramedic 
stressor that is activating a variety of

2954
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:42,480
antiinflammatory pathways,
antioxidant pathways.

2955
02:14:42,810 --> 02:14:47,810
You know,
and it's also last time I think on the 

2956
02:14:47,810 --> 02:14:48,120
podcast we talked about,
it increases norepinephrine,

2957
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:49,950
epinephrine itself.
It can,

2958
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:55,530
so cryotherapy and cold water immersion 
are two forms of of cold exposure.

2959
02:14:55,860 --> 02:15:00,860
Cryotherapy just two minutes at like a 
minus 180 Fahrenheit can increase 

2960
02:15:01,231 --> 02:15:02,430
norepinephrine.
Twofold.

2961
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:06,120
That's twofold over what you were before
you went in and nor epinephrin.

2962
02:15:06,330 --> 02:15:09,420
In addition to the brain benefits we 
were talking about how it makes you feel

2963
02:15:09,421 --> 02:15:10,830
good,
how it helps with learning.

2964
02:15:11,190 --> 02:15:14,130
It also is a very potent antifa 
inflammatory,

2965
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:17,670
so it inhibits the production of TNF 
Alpha,

2966
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:19,460
which is very.

2967
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:23,520
It's kind of like in arthritis,
tnf Alpha is kinda like going haywire.

2968
02:15:23,521 --> 02:15:28,521
You're making too much tnf Alpha,
and what happens is tnf alpha is a 

2969
02:15:28,521 --> 02:15:29,670
signaling molecule to or your immune 
cells that says,

2970
02:15:29,671 --> 02:15:31,830
hey,
there's an infection here because that's

2971
02:15:31,831 --> 02:15:36,831
normally what happens when you release 
Tnf Alpha is because there's some 

2972
02:15:36,831 --> 02:15:39,360
bacteria or some something that you need
to kill and so your immune cells,

2973
02:15:39,361 --> 02:15:41,640
all they see is the signal.
They don't know what's causing it.

2974
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:46,670
They don't know that it's because your 
gut cells and your immune cells in your 

2975
02:15:46,670 --> 02:15:48,180
gut are seeing bacteria because of your 
poor diet or whatever,

2976
02:15:48,181 --> 02:15:53,181
and so that's getting into the 
bloodstream and causing chronic 

2977
02:15:53,181 --> 02:15:53,181
inflammation.
It doesn't know that it.

2978
02:15:53,181 --> 02:15:57,380
All it knows is that this means there's 
a threat and so they start to increase 

2979
02:15:57,380 --> 02:16:00,630
the production of your immune cells make
hypochlorite,

2980
02:16:00,710 --> 02:16:01,860
which is like bleach.

2981
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:07,520
So you're making bleach in your body to 
kill things and that's happening 

2982
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:07,520
chronically.
That's going to cause some tissue damage

2983
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:10,170
is going to cause pain.
It also,

2984
02:16:10,171 --> 02:16:12,830
they also make hydrogen peroxide.
You make that.

2985
02:16:12,930 --> 02:16:17,930
Your immune cells will make that so 
cryotherapy inhibits the signaling 

2986
02:16:17,930 --> 02:16:20,310
molecule so that your immune cells quiet
down because now they're not seeing that

2987
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:22,050
signal that says,
come on,

2988
02:16:22,051 --> 02:16:22,830
hey,
fire up,

2989
02:16:22,831 --> 02:16:24,120
fire up.
It's not there.

2990
02:16:24,330 --> 02:16:26,700
So that's a good thing to inhibit tnf 
alpha.

2991
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:29,040
And like I said,
with the college as well.

2992
02:16:29,430 --> 02:16:31,150
Um,
but there are so many.

2993
02:16:31,151 --> 02:16:31,640
I did,
you know,

2994
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:34,900
I just spent two weeks just researching 
and reading.

2995
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:37,360
I've been doing some cold exposures,
you know,

2996
02:16:37,361 --> 02:16:42,361
like cold shower and also jumping in the
ocean ice bath and I really liked the 

2997
02:16:42,361 --> 02:16:46,700
cryo therapy that I did last time we 
were here and uh,

2998
02:16:47,230 --> 02:16:49,060
you know,
so I've been very interested in it,

2999
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:51,250
like understanding why you feel so good.

3000
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:56,250
And so I did some reading on it and 
there's so many different positive 

3001
02:16:56,250 --> 02:16:58,180
hormetic benefits from doing 
cryotherapy.

3002
02:16:58,181 --> 02:16:59,590
So you have,
you know,

3003
02:16:59,591 --> 02:17:00,150
the,
the,

3004
02:17:00,230 --> 02:17:04,270
the anti-inflammatory part and this,
and this also,

3005
02:17:04,271 --> 02:17:07,930
it's been shown that doing like 10 
sessions of cryotherapy in a row,

3006
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:13,290
it increases the expression of 
glutathione reductase by two fold and 

3007
02:17:13,631 --> 02:17:17,440
another glue of the fly on related 
enzyme glutathione peroxidase by like 68

3008
02:17:17,441 --> 02:17:20,680
percent.
And these are these enzymes like you can

3009
02:17:20,681 --> 02:17:22,960
be taking all the lyposomal glutathione 
you want,

3010
02:17:22,961 --> 02:17:27,961
like it's not going to matter if you 
don't have the enzyme's active to use 

3011
02:17:27,961 --> 02:17:31,501
it.
So you could take lyposomal glutathione 

3012
02:17:31,501 --> 02:17:32,000
and that's great.
You're increasing your,

3013
02:17:32,110 --> 02:17:33,810
you make glutathione inside of 
yourselves.

3014
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:34,690
But,
um,

3015
02:17:35,170 --> 02:17:40,170
we,
we can't make as much of it as we get 

3016
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:41,911
older,
but if you take it and you don't have 

3017
02:17:41,911 --> 02:17:43,330
the enzymes that use it to actually do 
the good stuff active,

3018
02:17:43,331 --> 02:17:44,110
that it doesn't matter.

3019
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:48,820
So cryotherapy was shown to activate to 
different glutathione related enzymes,

3020
02:17:48,821 --> 02:17:53,821
which is pretty awesome.
So it would enhance your body's ability 

3021
02:17:53,821 --> 02:17:56,761
to absorb glutosiome no,
it doesn't enhance your body's ability 

3022
02:17:56,761 --> 02:18:00,091
to absorb it.
It enhances your body's ability to use 

3023
02:18:00,091 --> 02:18:00,091
it.
So if you fight off bad,

3024
02:18:00,091 --> 02:18:02,650
good violin and then you're using 
cryotherapy,

3025
02:18:02,651 --> 02:18:04,300
it would enhance it.
Um,

3026
02:18:04,390 --> 02:18:07,540
so what I'm saying is that the lyposomal
glutathione that you take,

3027
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:10,930
all that does is increase glutathione 
inside of yourselves.

3028
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:16,560
Glutathione inside of your cells does 
nothing without enzymes that use it to,

3029
02:18:17,330 --> 02:18:22,330
uh,
to basically sequester damaging 

3030
02:18:22,330 --> 02:18:25,950
inflammatory things.
And the cryotherapy increased activates 

3031
02:18:25,950 --> 02:18:27,490
the enzymes that use it.
So it's like,

3032
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:32,610
great,
I have all this gludethyon sitting 

3033
02:18:32,610 --> 02:18:33,940
around on myself that I've been taking.
And I also now have the enzymes that use

3034
02:18:33,941 --> 02:18:36,840
it to do good stuff.
Now are being turned on that.

3035
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:40,480
What was very interesting is that it 
took like multiple sessions before,

3036
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:45,990
before those got like 10 to 2010 and one
at least 10 and you have and then the 

3037
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:49,340
other side he was 20,
so it was it consecutively at day,

3038
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:50,710
10 days in a row.

3039
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:52,360
Yeah,
10 days in a row.

3040
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:55,260
But the first day I didn't do it.
So that,

3041
02:18:55,261 --> 02:18:58,390
that was also very interesting.
So it's almost like your body is saying,

3042
02:18:58,391 --> 02:19:01,350
okay,
this crazy fuck of some response.

3043
02:19:01,351 --> 02:19:01,990
Yep.
Yeah.

3044
02:19:01,991 --> 02:19:04,780
Your body is preparing for war.
It's like it's stressful,

3045
02:19:04,830 --> 02:19:06,070
you know?
It's a stressful response.

3046
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:09,880
The other thing that's really cool that 
we didn't talk about last minute podcast

3047
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:15,480
is the thermogenic effect when you,
when you release nor norepinephrine.

3048
02:19:15,850 --> 02:19:20,850
So that's.
I keep going back to that because it's 

3049
02:19:20,850 --> 02:19:20,850
like you can't refute that.
Steve Novella,

3050
02:19:20,850 --> 02:19:22,960
no one know debunker skeptic.
No,

3051
02:19:22,961 --> 02:19:24,670
I don't care who you are.
You can't.

3052
02:19:24,671 --> 02:19:29,671
It's just,
it's consistent in every type of cold 

3053
02:19:29,671 --> 02:19:29,671
exposure period.
It's,

3054
02:19:29,671 --> 02:19:31,040
it's,
it's consensus.

3055
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:32,360
You release norepinephrine.

3056
02:19:32,410 --> 02:19:37,410
Well,
there always seems to be some sort of a 

3057
02:19:37,410 --> 02:19:37,410
rationalization with a lot of the 
debunking,

3058
02:19:37,410 --> 02:19:38,320
like whether it's the benefits of 
exercise,

3059
02:19:38,321 --> 02:19:42,400
whether it's a benefits of Cryo therapy.
That's almost like a rationalization for

3060
02:19:42,401 --> 02:19:47,401
not doing it.
It's like you're looking for an excuse 

3061
02:19:47,401 --> 02:19:48,130
to not do it and not really very 
objective.

3062
02:19:48,190 --> 02:19:49,150
Yes.
That was,

3063
02:19:49,151 --> 02:19:52,060
which was disturbing about.
It's like this is like you're poopooing

3064
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:54,370
people grape.
Yeah.

3065
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:55,280
Yeah.
I,

3066
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:57,670
it was clear.
I mean after especially especially after

3067
02:19:57,820 --> 02:19:59,020
the two weeks of research,
I mean,

3068
02:19:59,230 --> 02:20:01,210
I think there's a kind of mentality when
you're.

3069
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:04,870
Sometimes people like to think I'm a 
debunker and I'm not,

3070
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:06,790
I am,
I am intentionally.

3071
02:20:06,791 --> 02:20:11,791
Like,
because if you get in this mentality of 

3072
02:20:11,791 --> 02:20:12,800
always debunking something,
you're,

3073
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:15,370
it's like the spiral and you can't see 
the good.

3074
02:20:15,371 --> 02:20:18,310
Like you can't keep an open mind to like
get past.

3075
02:20:18,311 --> 02:20:20,650
You're like,
what's in your box that you know,

3076
02:20:20,651 --> 02:20:22,600
and that's very dangerous.
I think that,

3077
02:20:22,670 --> 02:20:24,780
and I think a lot of blind spots it is 
and,

3078
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:27,700
and there are a lot of scientists that I
know they're very smart,

3079
02:20:27,730 --> 02:20:32,730
extremely smart,
but they are in that loop where it's 

3080
02:20:32,730 --> 02:20:34,440
like just they have to debunk and 
criticized and it's like,

3081
02:20:34,441 --> 02:20:39,441
you know,
at some point huge discoveries are made 

3082
02:20:39,441 --> 02:20:40,510
by like connecting the dots and getting 
past that.

3083
02:20:40,511 --> 02:20:42,610
Like,
I mean you have to be critical.

3084
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:45,300
Being critical is very important,
but you also like,

3085
02:20:45,310 --> 02:20:47,560
I think there's a certain threshold 
where you just start to like,

3086
02:20:48,070 --> 02:20:49,930
you know,
you get to the spiral.

3087
02:20:50,210 --> 02:20:53,490
Well it was also was infuriating about 
this is the data's out there.

3088
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:55,590
This is not like it's not,
there's no data.

3089
02:20:55,591 --> 02:21:00,591
It's like he made a cursory examination 
of the evidence and what he chose to 

3090
02:21:01,230 --> 02:21:06,230
focus on was it was so subjective.
It was focused on a study that tested 

3091
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:08,290
muscle soreness,
posts,

3092
02:21:08,291 --> 02:21:09,350
exercise with cryotherapy.

3093
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:14,680
No,
actually the study that he referred to 

3094
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:14,680
as a Meta analysis and it was 
subjective,

3095
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:17,240
but it actually came to the conclusion 
that there were benefits.

3096
02:21:17,630 --> 02:21:22,630
However,
it said more studies and that needed to 

3097
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:25,481
be done because there wasn't large 
enough sample sizes and the quality of 

3098
02:21:25,481 --> 02:21:29,351
data was poor because there were not 
double blinded placebo controlled 

3099
02:21:29,351 --> 02:21:30,250
clinical trials and I have to say to you
so that,

3100
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:33,080
so they're actually what he resided in 
that article.

3101
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:36,870
There was a positive effect of the cow.
But the problem is,

3102
02:21:36,871 --> 02:21:39,740
is that because they followed that up 
with,

3103
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:40,100
oh,
well,

3104
02:21:40,101 --> 02:21:42,370
it's poor quality,
basically poor science.

3105
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:47,680
The reality is,
is that you can't do a double blinded 

3106
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:48,410
placebo control controlled trial with 
cryotherapy.

3107
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:50,510
Like you're,
you're going to be cold and you're going

3108
02:21:50,511 --> 02:21:53,450
to be putting this chamber where there's
like cold or you're not,

3109
02:21:53,451 --> 02:21:56,080
and you're going to know if you're cool,
you know?

3110
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:57,860
So anyways,
I thought that was ridiculous.

3111
02:21:57,861 --> 02:21:58,820
I just like whatever.
I'm in Oregon.

3112
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:03,530
I'm going to read about this stuff 
because I know I've experienced that.

3113
02:22:03,531 --> 02:22:06,050
There's definitely something going on.
Um,

3114
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:09,350
and one of the things that happens is 
the norepinephrine.

3115
02:22:09,351 --> 02:22:11,960
And when he released,
when you released that norepinephrine,

3116
02:22:12,380 --> 02:22:17,380
it activates a pathway in,
inside of your cells that basically are 

3117
02:22:18,790 --> 02:22:23,790
causes your energy metabolism,
metabolism to ramp up because you're 

3118
02:22:23,790 --> 02:22:25,580
trying to generate heat,
you want basically your wants to.

3119
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:27,450
Your body is saying,
I don't want to die,

3120
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,570
I need to make heat.
And so a couple of ways it can do that.

3121
02:22:30,571 --> 02:22:33,570
One,
it can shiver and shivering is when your

3122
02:22:33,571 --> 02:22:37,970
muscles start to contract and that it 
requires energy for your muscles to like

3123
02:22:38,010 --> 02:22:39,330
twitch.
It's very,

3124
02:22:39,350 --> 02:22:44,350
um,
it's not very thermodynamically 

3125
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:44,350
favorable.
So you,

3126
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:47,900
it's not a good way to generate heat but
you generate heat because you have to 

3127
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:47,910
like ramp up to twitch.

3128
02:22:48,390 --> 02:22:50,130
But then what happens after you've been 
exposed?

3129
02:22:50,131 --> 02:22:52,320
And actually this happens to me because 
we did the crowd twice.

3130
02:22:52,321 --> 02:22:57,321
The first time I did it,
I was shivering like the entire time I 

3131
02:22:57,321 --> 02:22:58,980
was shivering it was really crazy 
because I've never shivered like that in

3132
02:22:58,981 --> 02:23:03,981
my life.
But the second time I went in I did not 

3133
02:23:03,981 --> 02:23:03,981
shiver.
And after reading about it,

3134
02:23:03,981 --> 02:23:06,210
what happens is your body quickly adapt.
So you adapt.

3135
02:23:06,211 --> 02:23:08,790
And what happens is non shivering 
thermogenesis,

3136
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:12,660
so the nor epinephrin causes your 
Mitochondria,

3137
02:23:12,661 --> 02:23:15,950
which are the energy producing little 
organelles inside of yourselves,

3138
02:23:15,951 --> 02:23:17,190
well,
it causes them in your,

3139
02:23:17,400 --> 02:23:22,400
in your adipose tissue to get activated.
And it does this by increasing the 

3140
02:23:22,400 --> 02:23:27,231
expression of a gene called UCP,
one which basically freaks your 

3141
02:23:27,231 --> 02:23:29,550
mitochondria out because your 
mitochondria are kind of like batteries.

3142
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:34,700
They're charged,
they have a negative charge on the 

3143
02:23:34,700 --> 02:23:34,700
inside and a positive charge on the 
outside.

3144
02:23:34,700 --> 02:23:38,070
Will ucp one totally uncouples that so 
that there's no more charge.

3145
02:23:38,430 --> 02:23:41,320
And that charge is very important 
because when that charges is there,

3146
02:23:41,550 --> 02:23:42,750
your body knows,
okay,

3147
02:23:42,751 --> 02:23:46,230
I've been making energy because the way 
you make the charge is by making energy.

3148
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:48,090
So when the charge goes away,
your body's like,

3149
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:49,860
Oh my God,
I've got no energy.

3150
02:23:49,861 --> 02:23:52,380
So it just starts to ramp up fat 
metabolism.

3151
02:23:52,710 --> 02:23:55,350
So it does that,
and you start to make more mitochondria.

3152
02:23:55,351 --> 02:24:00,351
So you're,
you're making more mitochondria in your 

3153
02:24:00,351 --> 02:24:00,351
fat cells.
And this is often called Brown fat,

3154
02:24:00,351 --> 02:24:05,140
so you can actually.
The reason it's called Brown fat is 

3155
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:05,140
because when you look at a fat cell 
under the microscope,

3156
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:07,560
if it has more mitochondria than it 
looks Brown,

3157
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:11,850
so you actually start to burn fat and 
you have this thermogenic because you're

3158
02:24:11,851 --> 02:24:16,851
burning fat.
It's creating heat as a byproduct so 

3159
02:24:16,851 --> 02:24:19,341
you're warming your body,
but it has this nice side effect of 

3160
02:24:19,341 --> 02:24:19,341
burning fat,
which people like.

3161
02:24:19,341 --> 02:24:20,910
And the more you expose yourself to the 
cold,

3162
02:24:21,150 --> 02:24:26,150
the more you're browning your fat,
the more you're increasing those 

3163
02:24:26,150 --> 02:24:26,150
mitochondria,
your fats,

3164
02:24:26,150 --> 02:24:26,670
which means the next time you're in the 
cold,

3165
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:31,820
you can tolerate it longer.
So people that have been exposing 

3166
02:24:31,820 --> 02:24:32,430
themselves to cold like yourself when 
you're doing the Cryo,

3167
02:24:32,490 --> 02:24:37,490
you know,
often you actually can tolerate the 

3168
02:24:37,490 --> 02:24:40,380
colder for longer periods of time 
because you have more mitochondria in 

3169
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:44,781
your fat cells.
And this allows you to then generate 

3170
02:24:44,781 --> 02:24:44,781
more heat.
So,

3171
02:24:44,781 --> 02:24:48,190
and this has been shown in people,
people that have been exposed to a cold,

3172
02:24:48,191 --> 02:24:50,080
that they have been shown to increase 
their,

3173
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:50,880
their,
um,

3174
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:55,940
Brown adipose tissue by like 38 percent.
If they're exposed to 10 days of 50 

3175
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:56,930
degree air,
like outside air.

3176
02:24:56,940 --> 02:24:58,820
Just regular air,
50 degrees all,

3177
02:24:59,130 --> 02:25:00,030
all day,
10 days,

3178
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:03,060
so like six hours a day out in like,
you know,

3179
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:04,840
New York in the,
I don't know,

3180
02:25:05,310 --> 02:25:07,050
pretty winter or fall,
I don't know,

3181
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:10,350
something like that being out there for 
six hours for 10 days in a row.

3182
02:25:10,530 --> 02:25:15,530
Men were able to increase their brown 
adipose tissue by like 38 percent or 

3183
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:18,351
something like that.
So people from the east coast or from 

3184
02:25:18,351 --> 02:25:20,811
the northeast,
the move to California and then they go 

3185
02:25:20,811 --> 02:25:20,811
back during the winter,
they go home,

3186
02:25:20,811 --> 02:25:24,681
my blood got too thin.
Was really is there really is like a 

3187
02:25:24,681 --> 02:25:26,200
physical factor of your body not being 
accustomed to dealing with colby.

3188
02:25:26,350 --> 02:25:27,340
You adapt,
you adapt.

3189
02:25:27,341 --> 02:25:29,890
And that's what Brown adipose tissue.
And that's really one cold.

3190
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:33,340
How cold got really popular.
Popularized because people wanted to use

3191
02:25:33,341 --> 02:25:35,210
it as a hack to lose weight,
you know?

3192
02:25:35,230 --> 02:25:36,100
So they were like,
Oh,

3193
02:25:36,101 --> 02:25:41,101
if I do these cold showers,
I use it for the brain benefits because 

3194
02:25:41,101 --> 02:25:44,110
I noticed I feel really good and also 
more focused.

3195
02:25:44,200 --> 02:25:49,200
So I like that.
And a lot of people I've talked to have 

3196
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:49,200
felt the same way.
Um,

3197
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,970
but then I think the other part of this 
article was the,

3198
02:25:52,990 --> 02:25:57,660
the effects of it blunting some of the 
strength training and you know,

3199
02:25:57,810 --> 02:26:02,810
I talk about this in this report that I 
wrote or the in the podcasts that I 

3200
02:26:02,810 --> 02:26:04,960
released on and it's so complicated I 
had to like sit there and literally just

3201
02:26:04,961 --> 02:26:08,590
read for like two weeks to try to figure
it out because you know,

3202
02:26:08,591 --> 02:26:11,440
the problem is,
is that exercise is a hormetic stress.

3203
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:14,530
Cold is a hormetic stress.
So exercise itself,

3204
02:26:14,590 --> 02:26:19,590
you need some of the inflammation,
you need the bad stuff to get the good 

3205
02:26:19,590 --> 02:26:19,660
stuff.
That's how it works.

3206
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:25,160
But you know,
the inflammation that's happening 

3207
02:26:25,160 --> 02:26:25,780
happens while you're exercising and up 
to one hour after,

3208
02:26:26,110 --> 02:26:31,110
one hour after.
That's when the whole hormetic response 

3209
02:26:31,110 --> 02:26:34,321
kicks in.
And this has been shown in multiple 

3210
02:26:34,321 --> 02:26:35,791
studies.
One hour seems to be when the anti 

3211
02:26:35,791 --> 02:26:39,081
inflammatory response kicks in.
So you've generated the implementation 

3212
02:26:39,081 --> 02:26:39,430
and then now you've got the 
antiinflammatory effects.

3213
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,680
If you do a cold exposure within that 
hour after exercising,

3214
02:26:45,370 --> 02:26:50,370
it's possible.
You may blunt some of the inflammatory 

3215
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:53,431
effects that the exercise is inducing 
because the cold is activating anti 

3216
02:26:53,431 --> 02:26:54,970
inflammatory genes too early.
Now,

3217
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:57,430
I don't know that for certain,
but I do know that this,

3218
02:26:57,460 --> 02:27:00,760
this study that showed there was one 
study that showed strength training.

3219
02:27:00,970 --> 02:27:01,740
If you did it,
there were,

3220
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:05,750
if you did cryotherapy immediately,
like mediafly after a Cold War,

3221
02:27:05,770 --> 02:27:10,770
it was actually cold water immersion,
which is not the same as the Cryo cryo 

3222
02:27:10,770 --> 02:27:13,510
chamber that it blended some of the 
anabolic signaling.

3223
02:27:13,540 --> 02:27:15,910
And so there was like some of the muscle
mass was,

3224
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:18,400
was not gained,
but you know,

3225
02:27:18,401 --> 02:27:21,880
there's other studies that have been 
done that have shown for some reason.

3226
02:27:21,881 --> 02:27:23,920
All the endurance guys,
they always wait an hour.

3227
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:29,520
It's kind of weird.
So what I'm wondering is if people that 

3228
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:31,810
are doing this research like sit down,
take a step back,

3229
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:33,550
you know,
people are always in this.

3230
02:27:33,551 --> 02:27:34,810
I got to Polish it.
How to publish,

3231
02:27:34,811 --> 02:27:39,811
you know,
there's a real big publisher parish 

3232
02:27:39,811 --> 02:27:41,821
mentality and science where it's like 
your bread and butter depends on your 

3233
02:27:41,821 --> 02:27:43,900
publishing and so you're just constantly
trying to get that data out there,

3234
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:49,560
but you really,
I think things are so complicated just 

3235
02:27:49,560 --> 02:27:50,320
to sit down and take a look at 
everything that's out there and start to

3236
02:27:50,321 --> 02:27:53,080
go wait a minute.
There's lots of little details that need

3237
02:27:53,081 --> 02:27:55,660
to be considered to design this trial 
correctly.

3238
02:27:55,990 --> 02:28:00,990
So I'm hoping that at least for those 
people doing strength training that 

3239
02:28:00,990 --> 02:28:02,830
they'll do one where they actually wait 
until an hour because there's been other

3240
02:28:02,831 --> 02:28:07,831
studies where that strength to strength 
training in combination with cryotherapy

3241
02:28:08,111 --> 02:28:13,111
done much later.
Even the next day there were actually 

3242
02:28:13,111 --> 02:28:13,111
benefits,
performance benefits.

3243
02:28:13,111 --> 02:28:15,100
Like they able to do more of those leg 
curl things.

3244
02:28:15,101 --> 02:28:17,860
I don't know what they called leg 
extensions.

3245
02:28:17,861 --> 02:28:18,840
Those,
you know.

3246
02:28:18,850 --> 02:28:20,200
So,
you know,

3247
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:25,260
I don't really know what's going on,
but what I do know is that it seems as 

3248
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:26,420
though it's very likely that during the 
crowd therapy,

3249
02:28:26,421 --> 02:28:29,210
like immediately after and now.
Then again,

3250
02:28:29,211 --> 02:28:34,211
if you're,
if you're talking about someone that's 

3251
02:28:34,211 --> 02:28:34,211
doing,
um,

3252
02:28:34,211 --> 02:28:36,550
like there's been studies that have been
published showing that people that are 

3253
02:28:36,550 --> 02:28:39,791
doing two bouts of exercise,
so they're like riding a bike and then 

3254
02:28:39,791 --> 02:28:40,700
they,
they're waiting whatever,

3255
02:28:40,701 --> 02:28:43,850
30 minutes and then they go and run or 
something.

3256
02:28:44,390 --> 02:28:46,520
If they do cold water immersion in 
between those,

3257
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:48,620
they actually have performance 
enhancements.

3258
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:50,290
You know,
if they,

3259
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:52,130
if they wait,
I'm sorry,

3260
02:28:52,131 --> 02:28:53,960
I have to do it between two bouts of 
exercise.

3261
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:55,850
Some of that's due to the fact that 
cold,

3262
02:28:56,120 --> 02:29:01,120
the cold water,
it seems to improve heart rate 

3263
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:03,761
variability.
It x has been shown to improve it by 

3264
02:29:03,761 --> 02:29:06,101
like two to three fold.
So heart rate variability is the change 

3265
02:29:06,101 --> 02:29:08,720
in oscillation between heartbeats and 
it's also,

3266
02:29:08,721 --> 02:29:09,890
um,
people,

3267
02:29:10,490 --> 02:29:12,920
people judge a,
the heart recovery from a workout.

3268
02:29:12,921 --> 02:29:14,930
So as soon as you're done with an 
intense workout,

3269
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:17,870
the ability of your heart rate to lower 
immediately within minutes,

3270
02:29:17,871 --> 02:29:19,820
that's like a marker of heart rate 
variability.

3271
02:29:19,821 --> 02:29:24,821
And it's supposed to be good because 
your parts able to deal with these 

3272
02:29:24,821 --> 02:29:24,821
stressful changes,
you know,

3273
02:29:24,821 --> 02:29:26,570
because when you're making cortisol or 
something,

3274
02:29:26,571 --> 02:29:30,320
your heart starts racing more or some of
these other stress hormones,

3275
02:29:30,770 --> 02:29:35,770
uh,
so it's been shown to improve that and 

3276
02:29:35,770 --> 02:29:37,410
having her being able to have your heart
rate slower right after a workout and 

3277
02:29:37,410 --> 02:29:38,120
then you're immediately going to do a 
workout again.

3278
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:40,370
You can imagine there would be an 
performance enhancement with,

3279
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:43,010
with that.
So there's also,

3280
02:29:43,011 --> 02:29:48,011
there's a difference in the 
physiological response between cold 

3281
02:29:48,011 --> 02:29:48,830
water immersion and Cryo therapy,
right?

3282
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:50,000
Well,
it depends,

3283
02:29:50,060 --> 02:29:51,320
um,
you know,

3284
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:54,470
if there,
there are differences in the ability for

3285
02:29:54,471 --> 02:29:57,590
those two different modalities to 
extract heat from the body,

3286
02:29:58,030 --> 02:30:03,030
you know,
if we're talking about submerging 

3287
02:30:03,030 --> 02:30:03,030
ourselves and cold water up to our 
shoulders,

3288
02:30:03,510 --> 02:30:07,760
um,
water or ice is a much better.

3289
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:10,760
It's much better at extracting heat from
the body,

3290
02:30:10,761 --> 02:30:12,250
then error.
Um,

3291
02:30:12,530 --> 02:30:15,830
but surface area also plays a role and,
and the temperature change.

3292
02:30:15,831 --> 02:30:19,340
So if you're sitting in cold water 
that's 57 degrees,

3293
02:30:20,300 --> 02:30:24,290
that's not as cold as going into a minus
180 or whatever crowd chamber.

3294
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:27,560
But you can also sit in the cold water 
for a lot longer,

3295
02:30:27,990 --> 02:30:32,360
so I do it for 15 minutes.
I think that there has been a study that

3296
02:30:32,361 --> 02:30:37,361
compared the norepinephrine release,
20 seconds at 40 degree water up to the 

3297
02:30:37,361 --> 02:30:42,161
shoulders is comparable to two minutes 
at a minus standard,

3298
02:30:42,951 --> 02:30:46,490
something one 80 minus one 84,
no norepinephrine,

3299
02:30:46,491 --> 02:30:49,490
but a lot of the effects are mediated 
from nor norepinephrine,

3300
02:30:49,550 --> 02:30:52,160
but listened to 20 seconds at 40 to 
reverse those two minutes.

3301
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:57,160
So imagine,
imagine staying in the water for five 

3302
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:57,440
minutes in that.
And this has been shown.

3303
02:30:57,441 --> 02:31:01,280
So if you have someone that stays in 
water 57 degree water for an hour,

3304
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:04,640
they increased their norepinephrine by 
fivefold instead of twofold.

3305
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:08,030
So you have a more robust response.
So it could be good,

3306
02:31:08,750 --> 02:31:13,750
but it could be bad if you're talking 
about doing it right after a strength 

3307
02:31:13,750 --> 02:31:14,840
training session and jump into cold 
water for five minutes.

3308
02:31:15,140 --> 02:31:20,140
That could.
That could have some very potent 

3309
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:22,170
antiinflammatory effects.
So the best way to handle it would be to

3310
02:31:22,171 --> 02:31:24,420
wait at least an hour,
I think.

3311
02:31:24,590 --> 02:31:26,300
Yeah,
that makes sense.

3312
02:31:26,670 --> 02:31:29,250
What about a anti inflammatory markers 
in the blood?

3313
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:35,510
So there have been studies that have 
shown that cryotherapy lower c reactive 

3314
02:31:35,510 --> 02:31:36,840
protein,
which would be an inflammatory marker,

3315
02:31:36,841 --> 02:31:41,010
and then the glutathione related enzymes
going up and also superoxide dismutase,

3316
02:31:41,011 --> 02:31:46,011
that would be a marker for inflammation 
because there's also a decrease 

3317
02:31:46,111 --> 02:31:47,730
inflammation when you have more of 
those.

3318
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,980
So,
so cryotherapy does.

3319
02:31:49,981 --> 02:31:50,980
And then also,
um,

3320
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:54,150
there's been mark measurements of TNF 
Alpha going down.

3321
02:31:54,151 --> 02:31:58,170
Like I said,
I'm also another marker that macrophages

3322
02:31:58,171 --> 02:32:00,900
release macrophage inhibitory protein or
something,

3323
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:02,930
some inflammatory,
you know,

3324
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:06,000
a molecule that's made,
there's less of it when you,

3325
02:32:06,030 --> 02:32:11,030
when Cold War,
I can't remember if as cold water 

3326
02:32:11,030 --> 02:32:11,030
immersion or cryotherapy,
but it's cold exposure.

3327
02:32:11,030 --> 02:32:15,710
So.
And that was mediated through norb and 

3328
02:32:15,710 --> 02:32:15,710
ignore epinephrin mediates a lot of 
stuff.

3329
02:32:15,710 --> 02:32:16,580
It's,
it's mediating the brain effects.

3330
02:32:16,581 --> 02:32:18,980
It's mediating the thermogenesis.
It's antiinflammatory,

3331
02:32:18,981 --> 02:32:23,981
it's anti pain.
People get injected with norepinephrine 

3332
02:32:23,981 --> 02:32:24,690
and their spine to alleviate a pain.
Yes,

3333
02:32:24,691 --> 02:32:26,670
because it's anti inflammatory.
Wow.

3334
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Jesus.
There's probably other things going on 

3335
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:32,310
as well.
So science just science,

3336
02:32:32,311 --> 02:32:37,311
just the hard science.
There's plenty of evidence that there's 

3337
02:32:37,311 --> 02:32:37,311
benefits to grow therapy.
Oh yeah,

3338
02:32:37,311 --> 02:32:38,940
so why would I write an article like 
that?

3339
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:42,120
I'm like,
I said there's the,

3340
02:32:42,150 --> 02:32:46,770
there's the bad article that was the 
anabolic blunting effects which was done

3341
02:32:47,310 --> 02:32:52,310
immediately after exercise,
which made a huge splash because it's 

3342
02:32:52,310 --> 02:32:52,310
like,
Whoa,

3343
02:32:52,310 --> 02:32:52,980
you're right,
your gains.

3344
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:55,630
Um,
and then you have the,

3345
02:32:55,820 --> 02:33:00,820
the,
the hardcore are very skeptical people 

3346
02:33:00,820 --> 02:33:00,820
that are like,
well,

3347
02:33:00,820 --> 02:33:00,870
the quality of data,
you know.

3348
02:33:00,871 --> 02:33:01,680
Well,
the thing is,

3349
02:33:01,681 --> 02:33:06,681
is that there's a large body of data and
sometimes if you can't have a double 

3350
02:33:06,681 --> 02:33:09,390
blinded placebo controlled trial,
then you have to look at mechanism.

3351
02:33:09,630 --> 02:33:12,060
You have to look at animal studies 
combined with human studies.

3352
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:16,110
You have to understand what's going on.
You can't refute the norepinephrine.

3353
02:33:16,150 --> 02:33:18,030
We know that norepinephrine is doing all
these things,

3354
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:23,300
you know.
So I think you just have to be very 

3355
02:33:23,300 --> 02:33:23,910
comprehensive,
especially when the,

3356
02:33:23,970 --> 02:33:26,340
when you know,
there's the argument that the,

3357
02:33:26,341 --> 02:33:29,160
there's no placebo controlled trials or 
you know,

3358
02:33:29,161 --> 02:33:34,161
it's too subjective,
but there's lots of ways that it's not 

3359
02:33:34,161 --> 02:33:34,161
subjective.
And this has been measured in people.

3360
02:33:34,161 --> 02:33:38,841
People have measured the direct approach
and they've measured these enzyme 

3361
02:33:38,841 --> 02:33:41,631
activities.
They've measured these inflammatory 

3362
02:33:41,631 --> 02:33:41,631
molecules.

3363
02:33:41,631 --> 02:33:41,631
And people also in animals,
you know,

3364
02:33:41,631 --> 02:33:42,540
so there's,
I,

3365
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:47,560
I'm confident when I say that there are 
absolutely health benefits from doing 

3366
02:33:47,560 --> 02:33:49,920
cold exposure for your brain,
anti-inflammatory,

3367
02:33:50,100 --> 02:33:52,530
for,
for thermogenesis,

3368
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:53,910
you know,
being able to your,

3369
02:33:54,030 --> 02:33:55,560
if you can,
this is actually a,

3370
02:33:55,650 --> 02:33:57,000
a,
a target a lot.

3371
02:33:57,001 --> 02:33:59,040
I know a lot of researchers that are 
working on this,

3372
02:33:59,041 --> 02:34:04,041
they're trying to um,
find a way to pharmacologically brown 

3373
02:34:04,951 --> 02:34:08,400
fat because it increases fat burning and
weight loss.

3374
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:10,360
So we will,
of course,

3375
02:34:10,361 --> 02:34:12,230
it always,
people always try to do that with,

3376
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:14,970
I prefer the,
the,

3377
02:34:15,150 --> 02:34:20,150
the cold exposure.
But other things do at fish oil was 

3378
02:34:20,150 --> 02:34:21,910
shown to recently do that to increase a 
brown Brown adipose tissue.

3379
02:34:21,911 --> 02:34:26,530
So a plant based Omega six and three's.
No,

3380
02:34:26,610 --> 02:34:27,190
no,
no.

3381
02:34:27,191 --> 02:34:28,360
That's um,
so the,

3382
02:34:28,390 --> 02:34:31,870
so the fish or it was two grams of EPA 
and one gram of EPA,

3383
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:32,830
Dha.

3384
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:38,520
And it was,
it increased fat burning by like 27 

3385
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:42,511
percent or something during exercise.
And then at resting and increased it by 

3386
02:34:42,511 --> 02:34:44,230
something in the teens,
17 or 13 percent.

3387
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:47,800
And that was just at rest fat burning.
And the way it was shown,

3388
02:34:47,801 --> 02:34:49,570
the way it did,
it was by increasing UCP,

3389
02:34:49,571 --> 02:34:54,571
one,
uncoupling the Mitochondria and causing 

3390
02:34:54,571 --> 02:34:56,450
your basically causing your fat to make 
more Mitochondria and Brown fat.

3391
02:34:56,710 --> 02:34:58,900
Super Cool.
I've been taking high doses official,

3392
02:34:59,050 --> 02:35:04,050
but yeah,
to answer your question that the plant 

3393
02:35:04,050 --> 02:35:04,050
version,
and this is always a problem with a.

3394
02:35:04,060 --> 02:35:09,060
I get this question a lot from,
from people that are Vegan or 

3395
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:09,060
vegetarian,
you know,

3396
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:11,230
they're like,
well I get my Omega three from the plant

3397
02:35:11,231 --> 02:35:12,970
version,
Alpha linolenic acid.

3398
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:15,210
And actually,
um,

3399
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:20,280
there's,
there's a lot of important things to 

3400
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:21,751
consider.
One is that Alpha linolenic acid is 

3401
02:35:21,751 --> 02:35:22,720
poorly converted.
All these are.

3402
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:27,720
These are,
these are long chain polyunsaturated 

3403
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:27,730
fatty acids,
Alpha linolenic acids.

3404
02:35:27,731 --> 02:35:32,731
18 EPA is 20 eicosapentaenoic acid,
which is found in fish.

3405
02:35:33,130 --> 02:35:35,170
And then Dha is 22.
So you basically,

3406
02:35:35,171 --> 02:35:37,750
your body will take the Alpha Linolenic,
which is implants,

3407
02:35:37,830 --> 02:35:40,900
flax seeds,
walnuts,

3408
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:44,530
and it will start adding carbons on to 
make the other ones because you need the

3409
02:35:44,531 --> 02:35:46,960
other one's 30 percent of your brain is 
made of Dha.

3410
02:35:47,260 --> 02:35:49,660
Dha is very important.
But the thing is,

3411
02:35:49,661 --> 02:35:54,661
is that most men actually only convert 
about eight percent of Alpha linolenic 

3412
02:35:54,791 --> 02:35:56,710
acid into,
um,

3413
02:35:57,070 --> 02:36:02,070
into EPA and only four percent into Dha,
not very much now estrogen and actually 

3414
02:36:02,441 --> 02:36:07,441
can increase that production.
It can increase the gene that converts 

3415
02:36:07,441 --> 02:36:10,420
those because women are the ones that 
are,

3416
02:36:10,421 --> 02:36:15,421
you know,
carrying the child and Dha is very 

3417
02:36:15,421 --> 02:36:15,421
important for the developing brain,
very,

3418
02:36:15,421 --> 02:36:16,810
very important.
So it makes sense that nature would make

3419
02:36:16,811 --> 02:36:19,330
a way to be able to do that with the 
plant version.

3420
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:22,510
But the thing is,
is that there's been a study that showed

3421
02:36:22,511 --> 02:36:27,511
that people that take preformed Ala 
Alpha linolenic acid have to take 33 

3422
02:36:28,031 --> 02:36:33,031
point five times more than preformed Dha
or EPA to get the same amount of Dha and

3423
02:36:33,101 --> 02:36:35,050
EPA in the brain.
So a lot.

3424
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:36,790
There's a lot.
So there,

3425
02:36:36,890 --> 02:36:38,800
there are ways around,
um,

3426
02:36:39,670 --> 02:36:44,670
there are Vegan or vegetarian friendly 
sources which would be micro algae oil.

3427
02:36:44,950 --> 02:36:49,950
I think that I personally think that 
vegans and vegetarians should take my 

3428
02:36:49,950 --> 02:36:51,480
gradual.
If I was a Vegan,

3429
02:36:51,490 --> 02:36:54,160
which I can't ever see myself becoming 
one,

3430
02:36:54,161 --> 02:36:59,161
but I would absolutely take that.
Why do you not see yourself ever 

3431
02:36:59,161 --> 02:37:02,431
becoming one?
Because there are important 

3432
02:37:02,431 --> 02:37:05,131
micronutrients and neat that are,
that are important for a variety of 

3433
02:37:05,131 --> 02:37:06,730
physiological functions,
including the brain,

3434
02:37:06,910 --> 02:37:09,940
red blood cells.
You can supplement with some stuff,

3435
02:37:09,941 --> 02:37:14,260
but I just,
I haven't convinced myself not to to eat

3436
02:37:14,261 --> 02:37:16,040
meat.
So I think with,

3437
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:17,280
with Vegans,
well,

3438
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:22,600
vegans,
what they're trying to do is come up 

3439
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:23,450
with a sort of an ethical work around 
they're trying to figure out what's,

3440
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:28,840
how can you be healthy and live a vegan 
diet and is it healthy enough and most 

3441
02:37:29,211 --> 02:37:32,990
of them,
at least the hardcore proselytizing ones

3442
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:35,630
seem to think yes and they want 
everybody else to do it too.

3443
02:37:37,210 --> 02:37:42,210
There are a lot of benefits.
There are a lot of positive factors to 

3444
02:37:42,690 --> 02:37:47,690
eating a more begun like diet,
all the fiber you're getting begins.

3445
02:37:48,851 --> 02:37:53,851
I mean I do know there are some begins 
at a lot of processed junk so they're 

3446
02:37:53,851 --> 02:37:53,851
all,
you know,

3447
02:37:53,851 --> 02:37:55,110
not everyone that's vegans healthy,
but not everyone that's omnivores.

3448
02:37:55,190 --> 02:37:57,820
Helping the ones that are eating 
healthy,

3449
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:03,000
they're getting a lot of.
They're getting a watt wide broad 

3450
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,341
spectrum of plants.
They're getting the different fibers 

3451
02:38:05,341 --> 02:38:05,341
that getting into the micro,
they're getting the good micronutrients,

3452
02:38:05,341 --> 02:38:06,040
implants,
the magnesium,

3453
02:38:06,041 --> 02:38:08,320
the vitaminK ,
the full late a vitamin C,

3454
02:38:08,790 --> 02:38:12,190
and they're getting all the.
The hormetic compounds in the plant,

3455
02:38:12,191 --> 02:38:13,630
so those.
Those are really good things,

3456
02:38:13,631 --> 02:38:18,631
but the problem is is that they're,
they're more nutritionally deficient and

3457
02:38:18,821 --> 02:38:23,821
things that most people in the western 
world or not because the problem with 

3458
02:38:23,821 --> 02:38:28,710
the,
like the United States in general isn't 

3459
02:38:28,710 --> 02:38:28,710
that we eat enough meat here.

3460
02:38:28,710 --> 02:38:28,710
Most people,
unless you're Vegan or vegetarian,

3461
02:38:28,710 --> 02:38:33,361
people are eating enough meat there.
Problem is people aren't eating enough 

3462
02:38:33,361 --> 02:38:35,851
of their Greens and so I usually focus 
on micronutrients that are found in 

3463
02:38:35,851 --> 02:38:36,810
Greens because that's what people are 
not getting enough of,

3464
02:38:37,150 --> 02:38:42,150
but there are important micronutrients 
that are in meat that vegans and 

3465
02:38:42,971 --> 02:38:47,020
vegetarians are more subject to being 
deficient in like be 12.

3466
02:38:47,290 --> 02:38:50,860
So 12 and iron are are two really,
really important ones.

3467
02:38:51,190 --> 02:38:53,680
Both of these are very,
so b.

3468
02:38:53,681 --> 02:38:58,681
12 is very important for the production 
of neurotransmitters and Myelin in the 

3469
02:38:59,261 --> 02:39:00,580
brain,
both iron and B,

3470
02:39:00,581 --> 02:39:05,581
12 hour.
Most people think of iron as being 

3471
02:39:05,581 --> 02:39:05,581
important for your blood cells,
and it is,

3472
02:39:05,581 --> 02:39:06,880
it's,
it's bound to something called team,

3473
02:39:07,210 --> 02:39:08,500
which is a,
um,

3474
02:39:08,670 --> 02:39:13,670
a protein inside hemoglobin.
It's important for transporting oxygen 

3475
02:39:13,670 --> 02:39:14,740
to your tissues because you need oxygen 
to make energy.

3476
02:39:15,070 --> 02:39:20,070
So,
but the other thing that iron iron is 

3477
02:39:20,070 --> 02:39:21,490
doing is it's also important for making 
Myelin in the brain.

3478
02:39:21,550 --> 02:39:25,570
Myelin is what surrounds the axons of 
your neurons and allow it allows them to

3479
02:39:25,571 --> 02:39:27,670
communicate quickly.
It allows electrical signals,

3480
02:39:28,390 --> 02:39:30,490
signals to be trans,
ported quickly.

3481
02:39:31,060 --> 02:39:33,580
So that's important.
And then make neurotransmitters like you

3482
02:39:33,581 --> 02:39:35,170
need iron to make Serotonin in your 
brain.

3483
02:39:35,650 --> 02:39:39,340
And it's one of the reasons why during 
pregnancy irons very,

3484
02:39:39,341 --> 02:39:41,360
like if you have iron deficiency during 
pregnancy,

3485
02:39:41,390 --> 02:39:46,390
can cause abnormal brain structure or 
can cause birth defects because it 

3486
02:39:46,390 --> 02:39:48,850
shapes the structure and the wiring of 
the brain.

3487
02:39:49,320 --> 02:39:50,140
Um,
so that's,

3488
02:39:50,460 --> 02:39:55,460
you know,
obviously here in the United States we 

3489
02:39:55,460 --> 02:39:59,521
have supplements,
we have access to supplements and you 

3490
02:39:59,521 --> 02:39:59,521
know,
you can take a sublingual,

3491
02:39:59,521 --> 02:39:59,521
b 12,
you know,

3492
02:39:59,870 --> 02:40:04,870
it's,
it's a little bit of a different world 

3493
02:40:04,870 --> 02:40:04,870
than it is somewhere in like a 
developing country.

3494
02:40:04,870 --> 02:40:06,860
But B12,
it's animal base.

3495
02:40:06,861 --> 02:40:09,410
So how are they getting a plant base be 
12?

3496
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:11,360
Is there a plant that has [inaudible] in
it,

3497
02:40:11,361 --> 02:40:11,930
in large numbers?

3498
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:17,400
Um,
so b 12 is actually made a buy back 

3499
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:21,170
certain strains of bacteria.
And the reason to tie in me is because 

3500
02:40:21,170 --> 02:40:21,170
it gets me,
you know,

3501
02:40:21,170 --> 02:40:23,820
animals are predators and so it gets 
concentrated in their muscle,

3502
02:40:24,390 --> 02:40:26,040
gets concentrated in,
in animal tissue.

3503
02:40:26,250 --> 02:40:27,930
But what about animals that are 
herbivores?

3504
02:40:27,960 --> 02:40:30,880
I mean,
is it still predators?

3505
02:40:31,950 --> 02:40:33,210
Because they're,
they're eating,

3506
02:40:33,930 --> 02:40:36,780
they're eating a variety of,
of things that have the,

3507
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:41,840
the bacteria,
like there's certain strains of 

3508
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:42,360
mushrooms that have it in order to,
if you're a Vegan or vegetarian,

3509
02:40:42,361 --> 02:40:47,361
you're just eating those mushrooms.
You'd have to eat an enormous amount to 

3510
02:40:47,361 --> 02:40:50,211
get the RDA,
but it's more concentrated in animal 

3511
02:40:50,211 --> 02:40:51,630
meat which are constantly eating it.
So it gets concentrated in their tissues

3512
02:40:51,631 --> 02:40:56,631
because they are b.
12 is required as a cofactor for a lot 

3513
02:40:56,631 --> 02:40:57,870
of enzymes in multiple organs,
including their muscles.

3514
02:40:57,871 --> 02:40:59,380
So their muscles,
you know,

3515
02:40:59,510 --> 02:41:03,150
every time they're eating,
whatever has the be 12 on it,

3516
02:41:03,151 --> 02:41:04,110
they're concentrating it.

3517
02:41:04,470 --> 02:41:07,380
So there are certain types of bacteria 
that make be 12,

3518
02:41:07,381 --> 02:41:11,100
but I don't think vegans or vegetarians 
can just get it from that.

3519
02:41:11,610 --> 02:41:13,330
They have to eat a lot of it,
like,

3520
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:18,600
like one of those crazy.
So the argument that have Vegan can get 

3521
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:22,020
enough v12 from just a standard Vegan 
diet without supplementing.

3522
02:41:22,050 --> 02:41:23,640
You don't buy that?
No,

3523
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:25,330
I don't.
So there's,

3524
02:41:25,410 --> 02:41:30,410
there was a study that was done in 
Tanzania,

3525
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:37,280
so there's a few researchers.
Ucla actually is where I think one of 

3526
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:42,141
them just retired,
but there's some researchers at Ucla 

3527
02:41:42,141 --> 02:41:45,591
that we're studying the effects of b 12 
and iron deficiency on cognition,

3528
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:47,820
on,
you know,

3529
02:41:48,030 --> 02:41:53,030
learning cognition behavior.
And there was a bunch of studies that 

3530
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:56,250
were associative studies like that 
crappy premature ejaculation,

3531
02:41:56,251 --> 02:41:57,810
obesity where it's like,
you know,

3532
02:41:57,811 --> 02:42:00,270
these two things are associated but we 
don't know if it's causing.

3533
02:42:00,271 --> 02:42:01,980
And so there was an association with low
B,

3534
02:42:01,981 --> 02:42:06,450
Twelve low iron and poor Iq,
lower Iq,

3535
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:08,970
poor cognition,
poor behavior.

3536
02:42:09,570 --> 02:42:11,940
But there was no real causal,
you know,

3537
02:42:11,941 --> 02:42:14,210
roll identified.
And so these,

3538
02:42:14,280 --> 02:42:19,280
there's a couple of researchers at ucla 
that did two different clinical trials 

3539
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:20,530
where,
um,

3540
02:42:20,970 --> 02:42:25,970
there was 12 different schools in 
Tanzania that were selected and these 

3541
02:42:25,970 --> 02:42:27,540
clinical trials lasted two years and 
there was two of them.

3542
02:42:27,630 --> 02:42:32,630
The first trial was 575 kids are around 
600 and the other one was like 370 

3543
02:42:33,691 --> 02:42:38,691
something so closer to 400.
So total we're talking a total of about 

3544
02:42:38,691 --> 02:42:38,691
a thousand children.
School children,

3545
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:40,140
like these were elementary school 
children.

3546
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:43,620
And the typical thing they eat in 
Tanzania is,

3547
02:42:43,621 --> 02:42:44,940
um,
it's like a porridge,

3548
02:42:44,970 --> 02:42:49,970
I forgot the name of it,
but it's a porridge and it has 

3549
02:42:49,970 --> 02:42:52,461
vegetables,
it has beans and it has corn and that's 

3550
02:42:52,461 --> 02:42:56,481
their standard porch.
And so what the trial was designed with 

3551
02:42:56,481 --> 02:42:56,481
the school kids,
we're going to give it.

3552
02:42:56,481 --> 02:42:57,900
They were given a snack every single day
for two years,

3553
02:42:58,140 --> 02:43:03,140
either the porridge or they got the 
porch with a glass of milk or they got 

3554
02:43:03,140 --> 02:43:03,660
the porridge with meat.

3555
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:09,660
And every three to six months there were
arithmetic and reading tests done.

3556
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:13,360
So they were looking,
trying to measure cognitive performance.

3557
02:43:13,920 --> 02:43:14,880
And there was,
um,

3558
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:16,990
they measured physical performance and 
muscle mass.

3559
02:43:17,610 --> 02:43:18,460
Um,
and,

3560
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:23,440
and what the results were of this study 
was that the porridge with the meat.

3561
02:43:23,441 --> 02:43:27,370
So the school children that were eating 
the meat with the porridge scored better

3562
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:29,230
on math,
arithmetic.

3563
02:43:29,231 --> 02:43:32,710
They scored better on reading tests.
They had larger,

3564
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:36,420
they have more muscle mass and they grew
more than the other school children that

3565
02:43:36,430 --> 02:43:38,350
did not get the meat.
And they also.

3566
02:43:38,351 --> 02:43:41,170
So that's all quantitative.
Um,

3567
02:43:41,171 --> 02:43:46,171
they also,
they were more likely to exhibit 

3568
02:43:46,171 --> 02:43:47,000
leadership qualities out in the 
playground.

3569
02:43:47,030 --> 02:43:48,670
That's a little more subjective,
subjective,

3570
02:43:48,671 --> 02:43:52,480
but still interesting.
So the bottom line here is that,

3571
02:43:52,481 --> 02:43:54,100
you know,
obviously in Tanzania they're not,

3572
02:43:54,430 --> 02:43:56,300
they're not supplementing or not,
you know,

3573
02:43:56,440 --> 02:43:58,240
taking b,
12 iron and they're also,

3574
02:43:58,630 --> 02:44:02,050
there's also essential amino acids that 
are present neat,

3575
02:44:02,110 --> 02:44:04,840
which our bodies can't make,
which are found in some.

3576
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:08,890
You can find some plant sources of it,
like keen water or hempseed has it,

3577
02:44:09,250 --> 02:44:11,530
but they're not supplementing with that 
stuff over in Tanzania.

3578
02:44:11,531 --> 02:44:14,890
So if you don't have access to those 
things and you're just eating vegetables

3579
02:44:14,891 --> 02:44:19,891
and beans and corn,
then you will have nutritional 

3580
02:44:19,891 --> 02:44:20,260
deficiencies.
Now the question is,

3581
02:44:20,350 --> 02:44:22,030
if those children were given a,
b,

3582
02:44:22,031 --> 02:44:25,210
12 supplement or iron,
would that have made a difference?

3583
02:44:25,211 --> 02:44:26,650
Probably,
it probably would have.

3584
02:44:26,651 --> 02:44:31,651
I mean,
there's been studies in the United 

3585
02:44:31,651 --> 02:44:33,210
States that have been done on school 
children that have been deficient in 

3586
02:44:33,210 --> 02:44:35,641
certain micronutrients and they were 
given a multivitamin and an Omega three 

3587
02:44:35,641 --> 02:44:38,911
supplement,
fish oil and they only the ones that 

3588
02:44:38,911 --> 02:44:41,791
were deficient to begin with improved,
like did better on reading and 

3589
02:44:41,791 --> 02:44:45,480
arithmetic test.
So there's definitely an argument to be 

3590
02:44:45,480 --> 02:44:45,670
made there.
But I think,

3591
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:48,100
you know,
I think for Vegetarians,

3592
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:49,060
um,
you know,

3593
02:44:49,061 --> 02:44:50,470
we live in a very different time.

3594
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:55,530
Obviously there's,
there's protein powders and keenwah on 

3595
02:44:55,530 --> 02:44:59,540
hemp seed and be 12 sublingual.
And what are they getting [inaudible] 

3596
02:44:59,540 --> 02:45:00,680
from?
If it's a Vegan based,

3597
02:45:01,850 --> 02:45:03,190
I don't.
Oh,

3598
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:05,470
is that like,
I think possible.

3599
02:45:05,810 --> 02:45:08,670
I thought it was just like methyl 
cobalamin.

3600
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:10,980
So I don't,
I don't think that there's,

3601
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:12,220
it's not me,
it's just,

3602
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:16,120
it's just synthetic be 12.
How would they synthesizing it?

3603
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:19,540
I don't know.
You're going beyond my knowledge base,

3604
02:45:20,310 --> 02:45:25,300
but so there it is possible to get both 
iron and b 12 from.

3605
02:45:25,410 --> 02:45:26,260
So,
so b,

3606
02:45:26,261 --> 02:45:27,030
12 is,
I mean,

3607
02:45:27,031 --> 02:45:29,930
not a lot of vegetarians supplement with
b 12.

3608
02:45:29,950 --> 02:45:34,950
I mean they know and sublinguals 
important because there's also gene 

3609
02:45:34,950 --> 02:45:36,130
polymorphisms that affect the way your 
gut absorbs be 12.

3610
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:38,070
So people have to,
uh,

3611
02:45:38,320 --> 02:45:43,320
to bypass that.
You can put it onto your soul 

3612
02:45:43,320 --> 02:45:43,320
sublinguals the optimal way to take it.
Yeah.

3613
02:45:43,320 --> 02:45:44,140
I think for anyone,
if someone's a Vegan,

3614
02:45:44,141 --> 02:45:49,141
what are the,
what are the supplements that they 

3615
02:45:49,141 --> 02:45:49,141
should take?

3616
02:45:49,141 --> 02:45:49,141
You think b12 iron wood.
Okay.

3617
02:45:49,141 --> 02:45:50,260
Well with the iron is kind of tricky.
I just want to mention,

3618
02:45:50,261 --> 02:45:51,310
because you know,
iron,

3619
02:45:51,640 --> 02:45:56,640
a lot of vegans think that they can get 
their iron from their diet because iron 

3620
02:45:56,640 --> 02:45:57,630
is also found in beans.
It's,

3621
02:45:57,670 --> 02:45:59,140
it's in plants,
it's in Spanish,

3622
02:45:59,141 --> 02:46:02,350
but the way it's bound,
it's bound in something called phytate,

3623
02:46:02,800 --> 02:46:07,800
which we cannot digest.
And so the bioavailability of iron is 

3624
02:46:08,350 --> 02:46:13,350
one point eight times less in plant form
than in meet me.

3625
02:46:13,881 --> 02:46:15,830
It's bound to something called Heme,
which gives,

3626
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:20,210
it gives blood cells that are red color,
which is why red meat has more of it,

3627
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:22,430
but um,
people that are,

3628
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:28,240
uh,
that are vegetarian that think they're 

3629
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:30,821
getting enough iron,
I really think they should get their 

3630
02:46:30,821 --> 02:46:33,161
levels measured.
So women lose a lot of iron during 

3631
02:46:33,161 --> 02:46:33,161
menstruation.
So the,

3632
02:46:33,161 --> 02:46:35,570
so the RDA for iron for men is eight 
milligrams a day for women.

3633
02:46:35,570 --> 02:46:38,780
It's 18 went,
so already on top of that,

3634
02:46:38,781 --> 02:46:43,781
if you're a vegetarian or Vegan,
multiplying by one point eight is 

3635
02:46:43,781 --> 02:46:47,210
already important if you're just getting
it from food because the bioavailability

3636
02:46:47,211 --> 02:46:49,820
of iron is almost two fold less than 
from me.

3637
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:51,570
So that's one thing to consider.
And,

3638
02:46:51,670 --> 02:46:56,670
and the other thing is also an athletes.
So when you're like an endurance 

3639
02:46:56,670 --> 02:46:57,470
athlete,
you actually,

3640
02:46:57,471 --> 02:47:02,471
a hemo lysis occurs.
Red Blood cells lice when you're doing 

3641
02:47:02,471 --> 02:47:06,131
like very intense endurance training and
so you lose iron there too because 

3642
02:47:06,131 --> 02:47:10,381
you'll lose losing red blood cells.
Iron is tricky because you don't want 

3643
02:47:10,381 --> 02:47:14,530
too much of it.
It's like if you're supplementing like 

3644
02:47:14,530 --> 02:47:14,530
it's not.
There's no guesswork here.

3645
02:47:14,530 --> 02:47:17,510
There's no guesswork with iron.
Having so having too much,

3646
02:47:17,511 --> 02:47:20,300
when you take too much free,
like supplemental iron,

3647
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:21,650
it can cause,
you know,

3648
02:47:21,890 --> 02:47:24,830
free iron inside yourselves and that is 
like dynamite.

3649
02:47:24,830 --> 02:47:28,430
That's like,
like it reacts with enzymes in your body

3650
02:47:28,431 --> 02:47:32,720
and it screws up energy production.
It causes lots of damage.

3651
02:47:32,790 --> 02:47:33,770
So it's really,
really bad,

3652
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:38,830
really bad to get to my drug.
This is supplemental iron from actual 

3653
02:47:38,830 --> 02:47:39,890
sources.
Notes tightly regulated,

3654
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:41,720
but when you start to do supplemental 
iron,

3655
02:47:41,721 --> 02:47:43,250
yeah.
So I think that,

3656
02:47:43,251 --> 02:47:44,930
um,
and then there's Jane Pauley,

3657
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:46,840
some people like Dan has one,
I,

3658
02:47:46,890 --> 02:47:51,890
I've,
I've seen lots of people's DNA where 

3659
02:47:51,890 --> 02:47:54,041
they have a,
there's a variation in a gene that can 

3660
02:47:54,041 --> 02:47:55,160
lead to too much iron overload.
Um,

3661
02:47:55,430 --> 02:47:56,810
it's called hematic,
Chroma,

3662
02:47:56,870 --> 02:47:58,470
hemochromatosis,
and,

3663
02:47:58,670 --> 02:48:00,590
and it's very,
it is very common.

3664
02:48:00,850 --> 02:48:01,700
And if you,
if you're,

3665
02:48:01,701 --> 02:48:04,130
if you have one of those jeans and 
you're taking supplemental iron,

3666
02:48:04,670 --> 02:48:07,580
you have even more free irons.
It's very bad,

3667
02:48:07,850 --> 02:48:12,850
very bad.
So I think that people should 

3668
02:48:12,850 --> 02:48:12,850
definitely,
I don't know what all the blood levels,

3669
02:48:12,850 --> 02:48:13,760
there's different markers that you can 
measure,

3670
02:48:13,761 --> 02:48:18,761
your physician will know,
but getting iron levels measured is 

3671
02:48:18,761 --> 02:48:18,761
important.

3672
02:48:18,761 --> 02:48:20,870
If you're gonna start supplementing and 
when you do supplement with Arne,

3673
02:48:20,890 --> 02:48:23,750
is it important to take it with food,
with,

3674
02:48:23,770 --> 02:48:26,050
uh,
with fats like what is,

3675
02:48:26,100 --> 02:48:29,270
what is the absorption?
Vitamin C,

3676
02:48:29,480 --> 02:48:34,480
Vitamin C,
I'm dramatically increases the 

3677
02:48:34,480 --> 02:48:37,151
absorption of non heme iron.
So hire an iron that's not found in 

3678
02:48:37,151 --> 02:48:38,900
meat.
So even actually people vegetarians that

3679
02:48:38,901 --> 02:48:40,790
are eating a bunch of beans,
legumes,

3680
02:48:41,260 --> 02:48:46,260
um,
first of all they needed to get one one 

3681
02:48:46,260 --> 02:48:46,260
point eight times more than they would 
have meat,

3682
02:48:46,260 --> 02:48:50,651
but they also,
if they eat it with a citrus fruit or 

3683
02:48:50,651 --> 02:48:51,860
have some berries or Broccoli's high in 
vitamin C habit with your beans,

3684
02:48:52,010 --> 02:48:53,410
that would,
that would make a,

3685
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:56,330
make a difference in increasing the 
bioavailability of iron.

3686
02:48:56,720 --> 02:49:01,720
So that would be important.
That's a fascinating aspect of food 

3687
02:49:01,720 --> 02:49:04,571
supplementary or supplementation is 
eating it with the right foods and 

3688
02:49:04,571 --> 02:49:05,040
making sure that,
you know,

3689
02:49:05,060 --> 02:49:09,000
some things you don't want to eat with 
any food at all and some things you want

3690
02:49:09,001 --> 02:49:11,130
to have on a full stomach or you want 
fat.

3691
02:49:11,360 --> 02:49:13,950
The fat soluble vitamins,
carotinoids,

3692
02:49:13,951 --> 02:49:15,560
even vitamin D.
um,

3693
02:49:15,650 --> 02:49:18,870
the,
the vitamins that are soluble in fat are

3694
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:22,260
the bioavailability is increased when 
you take it with fat.

3695
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:27,920
And so that would be another one 
actually a lot of vegetarians probably 

3696
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:29,730
think they're getting enough vitamin a 
because Beta carotene,

3697
02:49:29,731 --> 02:49:32,880
which is in plants,
can be converted into vitamin A.

3698
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:34,840
Vitamin a gets is actually,
um,

3699
02:49:35,700 --> 02:49:40,700
it actually becomes a hormone and it 
works much like Vitamin d not quite the 

3700
02:49:40,700 --> 02:49:41,610
same,
but it does change,

3701
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:43,470
it activates genes,
turns genes off,

3702
02:49:43,471 --> 02:49:48,471
does all this stuff.
So it's very important for immune 

3703
02:49:48,471 --> 02:49:48,471
function,
for your eye,

3704
02:49:48,471 --> 02:49:48,780
for vision,
but there are,

3705
02:49:48,781 --> 02:49:49,500
um,
you have to,

3706
02:49:49,650 --> 02:49:53,190
the bioavailability of Beta carotene is 
very low.

3707
02:49:53,220 --> 02:49:56,670
We don't absorb it very well.
That increases that bioavailability.

3708
02:49:56,671 --> 02:49:58,890
So taken with that because they are fat 
soluble,

3709
02:49:59,190 --> 02:50:00,630
the carotenoids,
Beta carotenes,

3710
02:50:00,631 --> 02:50:01,920
fat soluble,
and also,

3711
02:50:01,921 --> 02:50:06,030
um,
there are gene polymorphisms that people

3712
02:50:06,031 --> 02:50:09,870
have so they don't convert Beta carotene
into vitamin a very well.

3713
02:50:09,870 --> 02:50:12,600
Like my brother in law has one where he 
doesn't at all very well.

3714
02:50:12,601 --> 02:50:17,601
So he has to actually get vitamin a from
an animal source or you can get retinal 

3715
02:50:18,721 --> 02:50:19,740
acetate.
I don't know,

3716
02:50:19,741 --> 02:50:24,741
I think it's synthetic,
but that's something that some 

3717
02:50:24,741 --> 02:50:24,741
vegetarians may consider,
not,

3718
02:50:24,741 --> 02:50:26,040
not all of them,
but some just considering whether or not

3719
02:50:26,041 --> 02:50:29,580
they have that gene polymorphism.
I think the main ones are iron B,

3720
02:50:29,581 --> 02:50:33,480
12,
Omega three and vitamin D there,

3721
02:50:33,560 --> 02:50:35,760
you know,
70 percent of the population doesn't get

3722
02:50:35,761 --> 02:50:40,761
enough vitamin D,
but vegetarians often think they're 

3723
02:50:40,761 --> 02:50:41,700
getting enough vitamin D because you 
make it from the sun.

3724
02:50:42,270 --> 02:50:43,490
But you know,
the problem is,

3725
02:50:43,491 --> 02:50:48,491
is that so many factors regulate that 
because a uvb radiation has to hit your 

3726
02:50:48,781 --> 02:50:53,781
skin to make it.
And so if your wearing sunscreen or you 

3727
02:50:53,781 --> 02:50:54,060
have um,
a lot of melanin,

3728
02:50:54,061 --> 02:50:59,061
so if you're,
you've got like dark pigmentation that 

3729
02:50:59,061 --> 02:50:59,061
blocks it out latitude where you live.

3730
02:50:59,061 --> 02:51:03,680
So uvb rays,
like don't hit the atmosphere certain 

3731
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:04,610
times of the year in certain regions.
So you know,

3732
02:51:04,620 --> 02:51:08,610
you're only three or four months out of 
the year can make Vitamin d from the sun

3733
02:51:08,611 --> 02:51:10,050
and then age,
you know,

3734
02:51:10,051 --> 02:51:15,051
as you get older,
a 70 year old makes only 25 percent of 

3735
02:51:15,051 --> 02:51:16,440
the vitamin D that they made when they 
were 20 years old.

3736
02:51:16,750 --> 02:51:17,670
Wow.
Yeah.

3737
02:51:17,671 --> 02:51:20,730
So all these factors play a role and 
there is a vitamin.

3738
02:51:20,731 --> 02:51:25,731
I know I was talking to Rachel about 
this because vitamin D supplements d 

3739
02:51:25,731 --> 02:51:27,920
three,
the plant form is [inaudible].

3740
02:51:28,390 --> 02:51:33,390
It's made by mushrooms.
Mushrooms also make vitamin D when 

3741
02:51:33,390 --> 02:51:35,811
they're exposed to sun.
The plant form doesn't get converted 

3742
02:51:35,811 --> 02:51:37,590
into the hormone very well.
And also there's been two recent studies

3743
02:51:37,591 --> 02:51:42,591
that have shown that [inaudible] may 
actually inhibit a [inaudible] function 

3744
02:51:42,591 --> 02:51:47,151
and muscle.
So it actually has negative effects in 

3745
02:51:47,151 --> 02:51:47,580
muscle tissue.
Taking too much do too.

3746
02:51:47,640 --> 02:51:48,810
Yeah.
So [inaudible] is the,

3747
02:51:48,811 --> 02:51:53,811
is the best supplement form and most of 
the [inaudible] on the markets from 

3748
02:51:54,450 --> 02:51:58,260
lanolin which is secreted from sheep 
skin or something.

3749
02:51:58,261 --> 02:52:00,210
I don't know.
I don't think that's Vegan friendly.

3750
02:52:00,211 --> 02:52:05,211
But there is.
There is a type of algae Lichen Lichen 

3751
02:52:05,211 --> 02:52:10,200
that that's a,
that makes vitamin D and lincolns and 

3752
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:10,200
algae.
I don't know what it is.

3753
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:14,750
White plant.
Is it weird funky stuff that grows 

3754
02:52:14,750 --> 02:52:14,750
fungus?
Alaska?

3755
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:17,320
Yeah.
It's like a moss almost.

3756
02:52:18,050 --> 02:52:19,180
Let me pull that up.
Liking.

3757
02:52:19,670 --> 02:52:20,890
Yeah.
So it's something that,

3758
02:52:20,891 --> 02:52:25,891
uh,
I know Caribou eat a lot of black tail 

3759
02:52:25,891 --> 02:52:26,470
deer,
so it's like a white,

3760
02:52:26,560 --> 02:52:30,490
tasteless sort of a grass that they 
exist or not a grasp,

3761
02:52:30,491 --> 02:52:31,720
like a,
almost like a,

3762
02:52:32,930 --> 02:52:35,200
it's weird.
It's weird plant here.

3763
02:52:36,010 --> 02:52:38,120
That's what it looks like.
What does that,

3764
02:52:38,850 --> 02:52:42,700
that was kind of weird looking.
It's weird stuff.

3765
02:52:43,540 --> 02:52:45,520
Yeah.
You find it all over the place on Prince

3766
02:52:45,521 --> 02:52:50,521
Edward Island in Alaska was the first 
place I came in contact with it and I 

3767
02:52:50,521 --> 02:52:50,521
was like,
what is this?

3768
02:52:50,521 --> 02:52:53,080
And then we'll this black tail deer eat 
a lot of,

3769
02:52:53,680 --> 02:52:58,520
some kind of a plant so you can get 
three from that because the company that

3770
02:52:58,570 --> 02:53:03,570
makes teeth.
So there are vegan friendly sources of 

3771
02:53:03,570 --> 02:53:03,570
it.
So if,

3772
02:53:03,570 --> 02:53:07,440
if they do want to eat Vegan,
it is possible to get a fully balanced 

3773
02:53:07,440 --> 02:53:08,680
diet and protein would be the other way.
The other thing,

3774
02:53:08,681 --> 02:53:13,681
right?
The essential amino acids are typically 

3775
02:53:13,681 --> 02:53:15,370
found in animal protein.
So getting,

3776
02:53:15,440 --> 02:53:17,650
um,
so those are like leucine,

3777
02:53:17,950 --> 02:53:19,420
leucine,
Tryptophan,

3778
02:53:20,380 --> 02:53:21,330
penal,
Alanine,

3779
02:53:21,370 --> 02:53:22,300
I don't know,
there's nine of them,

3780
02:53:22,301 --> 02:53:27,301
but just exist some really low doses.
And in most plant based proteins,

3781
02:53:28,181 --> 02:53:31,120
is that what the problem is?
I know the very,

3782
02:53:31,121 --> 02:53:32,650
very,
very low doses,

3783
02:53:32,651 --> 02:53:34,720
but you can get some that have higher 
doses.

3784
02:53:35,830 --> 02:53:40,830
It's hemp seed and then chemo.
So those are the only two now I'm sure 

3785
02:53:40,830 --> 02:53:41,870
there's more than enough.

3786
02:53:41,960 --> 02:53:46,960
Right?
But they have like really a full amino 

3787
02:53:46,960 --> 02:53:49,570
acid profile and they have the essential
ones that you need.

3788
02:53:49,610 --> 02:53:54,610
And keep in mind the essential proteins.
That's what's the branch chain amino 

3789
02:53:54,610 --> 02:53:57,931
acids.
That's what that actually taken up into 

3790
02:53:57,931 --> 02:53:57,931
muscle cells.
So.

3791
02:53:57,931 --> 02:53:58,930
And there's been studies that have been 
done just getting,

3792
02:53:58,960 --> 02:54:02,350
doing plant protein without the 
essential amino acids.

3793
02:54:02,570 --> 02:54:07,570
Does not do not.
You can't gain muscle mass after doing 

3794
02:54:07,570 --> 02:54:11,341
strength training like you can if you 
take in the essential amino acids 

3795
02:54:11,341 --> 02:54:15,901
because that's.
You need those to be taken up into 

3796
02:54:15,901 --> 02:54:18,241
muscle to build proteins.
Well there's some of the weird Vegan 

3797
02:54:18,241 --> 02:54:20,500
arguments that they repeat almost as if 
it's fact,

3798
02:54:20,501 --> 02:54:25,501
but that's not.
And one of them was that saturated fats 

3799
02:54:25,501 --> 02:54:26,200
and saturated fats are somehow or 
another bad for you.

3800
02:54:27,230 --> 02:54:31,960
Yeah.
So that's a very confusing literature.

3801
02:54:31,961 --> 02:54:36,961
I think I'm saturated fats in and of 
themselves aren't necessarily bad unless

3802
02:54:38,981 --> 02:54:39,550
you have.

3803
02:54:39,610 --> 02:54:42,970
There are certain gene polymorphisms in 
um,

3804
02:54:43,150 --> 02:54:45,100
so PPR,
Alpha,

3805
02:54:45,130 --> 02:54:47,260
Ppr,
Gamma fto genes,

3806
02:54:47,830 --> 02:54:52,830
if you have a gene polymorphism in one 
of these three genes because in order 

3807
02:54:54,251 --> 02:54:54,890
to,
um,

3808
02:54:55,060 --> 02:55:00,060
when you eat diet,
saturated fat and it needs to be 

3809
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:00,060
metabolized,
transported to the right place,

3810
02:55:00,060 --> 02:55:01,430
you know,
you don't want it just sitting around in

3811
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:03,590
a,
as fatty acids in bloodstream.

3812
02:55:03,890 --> 02:55:05,420
Will.
Those jeans that I just mentioned,

3813
02:55:05,421 --> 02:55:10,421
they play a role in doing that.
Some people don't activate them very 

3814
02:55:10,421 --> 02:55:11,360
well,
and so if they have a high saturated fat

3815
02:55:11,361 --> 02:55:14,000
and a low poly or mono unsaturated fat 
intake,

3816
02:55:14,450 --> 02:55:17,270
they can actually have increased type 
two diabetes.

3817
02:55:17,271 --> 02:55:22,271
They can have poor glucose response 
because fatty acids are sitting around 

3818
02:55:22,271 --> 02:55:25,640
in their bloodstream and antagonizing 
the insulin receptor I'm doing,

3819
02:55:25,670 --> 02:55:30,670
doing all sorts of things,
but if they have a higher 

3820
02:55:30,670 --> 02:55:33,250
polyunsaturated fat,
which is found in fish or nuts or mono 

3821
02:55:33,250 --> 02:55:34,520
unsaturated fat,
so abakada autos,

3822
02:55:34,850 --> 02:55:36,020
nuts,
olive oil.

3823
02:55:36,230 --> 02:55:41,230
If they have a higher ratio of those,
then it activates those genes more and 

3824
02:55:41,230 --> 02:55:41,580
so they don't actually have those 
negative effects,

3825
02:55:41,581 --> 02:55:43,640
so that's one thing.
That's the smaller thing.

3826
02:55:43,820 --> 02:55:47,210
The real problem with saturated fat is 
actually sugar.

3827
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:49,550
Yeah.
The,

3828
02:55:49,551 --> 02:55:50,360
the.
There's.

3829
02:55:50,480 --> 02:55:55,480
The problem is is that saturated fat 
increases the production of ldl 

3830
02:55:55,581 --> 02:56:00,581
cholesterol,
which isn't necessarily bad unless you 

3831
02:56:00,581 --> 02:56:04,271
have massive inflammation from eating 
refined carbohydrates and specifically 

3832
02:56:04,271 --> 02:56:06,200
from eating sucrose or fructose corn 
syrup,

3833
02:56:06,860 --> 02:56:09,050
and this has been shown actually a 
colleague of mine,

3834
02:56:09,051 --> 02:56:13,820
Ron Kraus,
he's a brilliant cardio cardiologist and

3835
02:56:13,821 --> 02:56:18,821
he's actually one of the guys that he 
discovered a a test to measure what 

3836
02:56:20,541 --> 02:56:23,930
really the bad part of cholesterol,
which isn't just ldl.

3837
02:56:23,931 --> 02:56:28,931
It's actually a small dense particle and
that small dense particles formed only 

3838
02:56:29,210 --> 02:56:34,210
when you have have the saturated fat 
plus the high fructose corn syrup or the

3839
02:56:34,311 --> 02:56:36,530
refined sugar because it's causing 
inflammation.

3840
02:56:36,530 --> 02:56:38,750
So I did a podcast with him.
It's a little technical,

3841
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:41,990
but like my mother in law,
she,

3842
02:56:42,050 --> 02:56:45,710
she,
she watched the video and she had done a

3843
02:56:45,740 --> 02:56:50,420
liquid panel where the her physician had
measured her ldl particle,

3844
02:56:50,750 --> 02:56:52,970
measuring particle size,
measured triglycerides,

3845
02:56:52,971 --> 02:56:57,971
all of these things wanting to get her 
on stands because she had really high 

3846
02:56:57,971 --> 02:57:01,780
cholesterol.
It turns out I knew why she had high 

3847
02:57:01,780 --> 02:57:01,850
cholesterol.
She has high cholesterol because she has

3848
02:57:01,851 --> 02:57:06,851
gene polymorphism in April.
We for which prevents cholesterol from 

3849
02:57:06,851 --> 02:57:06,851
being recycled,
so it's not.

3850
02:57:06,890 --> 02:57:11,890
That's why she has high cholesterol,
so she watched this video and she like 

3851
02:57:11,890 --> 02:57:14,681
learned all about the particle size and 
that it's the small dense ones that are 

3852
02:57:14,681 --> 02:57:16,370
really an indicator of cardiovascular 
disease and her small dense were like,

3853
02:57:16,670 --> 02:57:21,670
she had none.
It was all the good kind of all the ldl 

3854
02:57:21,670 --> 02:57:22,940
cholesterol is important because anytime
you make a new cell,

3855
02:57:22,941 --> 02:57:23,750
you need cholesterol.

3856
02:57:23,780 --> 02:57:26,230
Cholesterol is made of cell membranes.
Every time you're making a new kidney,

3857
02:57:26,231 --> 02:57:27,470
your liver cell,
you need cholesterol.

3858
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:32,680
When you have damage,
when you hit yourself or you're doing 

3859
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:32,980
your workout and your muscles get a 
little damaged,

3860
02:57:32,981 --> 02:57:36,110
you need cholesterol there to build,
to repair that damage so you need it.

3861
02:57:36,830 --> 02:57:37,970
If you don't have it,
you're in trouble.

3862
02:57:37,971 --> 02:57:42,971
But anyways,
the point is is that the saturated fat 

3863
02:57:42,971 --> 02:57:46,331
can.
That's why there's so much confusion is 

3864
02:57:46,331 --> 02:57:49,841
because one gene polymorphisms to people
are now starting to tease apart that 

3865
02:57:50,331 --> 02:57:54,740
it's actually the combination of eating 
refined carbohydrates and saturated fat.

3866
02:57:54,880 --> 02:57:59,880
If you just have the saturated fat you 
don't have and you're eating vegetables 

3867
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:03,281
and good things as well,
then you're not going to have all that 

3868
02:58:03,281 --> 02:58:03,281
inflammation.
You're not going to make small dense ldl

3869
02:58:03,281 --> 02:58:07,941
particles,
which I talked about this with you last 

3870
02:58:07,941 --> 02:58:09,591
time.
That's what makes the small dense ldls 

3871
02:58:09,591 --> 02:58:09,591
inflammation.

3872
02:58:09,591 --> 02:58:11,310
So when you have the small dense,
because a certain protein gets obscured,

3873
02:58:11,730 --> 02:58:14,520
it causes it to like stick to the,
um,

3874
02:58:14,580 --> 02:58:16,770
to the walls of your blood vessels very 
easy.

3875
02:58:17,130 --> 02:58:22,130
So that's kind of the danger because 
then you start to accumulate a plaque 

3876
02:58:22,130 --> 02:58:25,101
there.
So there's totally makes sense when you 

3877
02:58:25,101 --> 02:58:27,801
talk about the amount of heart disease 
that exists in people that have this 

3878
02:58:27,801 --> 02:58:29,280
typical American diet which is high in 
saturated fat,

3879
02:58:29,281 --> 02:58:31,900
but also high in high fructose corn 
syrup process.

3880
02:58:31,901 --> 02:58:33,650
Sugars in vegetables.
Yeah.

3881
02:58:34,070 --> 02:58:34,830
I mean,
here's the thing.

3882
02:58:35,160 --> 02:58:36,720
This is the problem with all those 
studies,

3883
02:58:37,110 --> 02:58:42,110
those studies that are correlations is 
that you're looking at people that are 

3884
02:58:42,151 --> 02:58:43,500
eating.
Yes,

3885
02:58:43,501 --> 02:58:44,940
they're eating meat,
yes,

3886
02:58:44,941 --> 02:58:48,540
they're eating saturated fat,
but they're also not eating vegetables.

3887
02:58:48,630 --> 02:58:53,630
They're also eating cake and crackers 
and chips and hamburger bonds and you 

3888
02:58:53,630 --> 02:58:55,560
know,
all that stuff and her lifestyle,

3889
02:58:55,590 --> 02:58:57,240
sedentary lifestyle,
all those things.

3890
02:58:57,240 --> 02:59:02,240
So you know that these studies like you 
have to really take it with a grain of 

3891
02:59:03,211 --> 02:59:06,030
salt and especially for healthy 
omnivores,

3892
02:59:06,060 --> 02:59:06,660
you know,
like I said,

3893
02:59:06,661 --> 02:59:08,100
there are vegetarians that are 
unhealthy.

3894
02:59:08,101 --> 02:59:13,101
They eat a bunch of process.
There's also very healthy vegetarians 

3895
02:59:13,101 --> 02:59:13,101
and vegans out there.
Well,

3896
02:59:13,101 --> 02:59:16,700
there's a lot of unhealthy omnivores.
I mean if you were to go to like the DMV

3897
02:59:16,701 --> 02:59:19,350
where like someplace to everyone has to 
go and like take a survey.

3898
02:59:19,830 --> 02:59:22,740
How many of them eat me?
Will it probably like 95 percent of them

3899
02:59:22,741 --> 02:59:25,830
are going to eat meat and then you ask 
them like what's their vegetable intake?

3900
02:59:26,070 --> 02:59:27,810
You know,
what's your refining?

3901
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:30,210
How many refined carbohydrates do you 
take in how many,

3902
02:59:30,380 --> 02:59:35,380
you know,
they're all going to be not eating 

3903
02:59:35,380 --> 02:59:37,281
vegetables and they're going to be 
eating their cake and chips and you 

3904
02:59:37,281 --> 02:59:37,290
know,
there's their,

3905
02:59:37,320 --> 02:59:42,320
their hot dog buns and sort of blame it 
all on these.

3906
02:59:43,170 --> 02:59:46,140
The blame it all on saturated fats is 
wrong.

3907
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:47,490
It is.
You know,

3908
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:52,610
some people can have a problem with 
saturate when they have too high of a 

3909
02:59:52,610 --> 02:59:54,570
saturated fat intake,
even if they're eating healthy.

3910
02:59:54,780 --> 02:59:56,430
Other healthy stuff,
like I said,

3911
02:59:56,431 --> 03:00:01,140
because the gene that that's activated 
that helps metabolize the fat,

3912
03:00:01,141 --> 03:00:06,141
break it up,
transports it to where it goes isn't 

3913
03:00:06,141 --> 03:00:06,141
getting turned on.
Well,

3914
03:00:06,141 --> 03:00:07,350
we'll get those genes get turned on by 
polyunsaturated fatty acids.

3915
03:00:07,650 --> 03:00:10,860
And so if you eat a ratio,
if you're eating saturated fat,

3916
03:00:10,890 --> 03:00:14,370
which is dairy,
you know some pork,

3917
03:00:15,220 --> 03:00:16,710
I don't know,
red meat mostly.

3918
03:00:16,711 --> 03:00:21,711
Like if you get a lean cut,
it's not even actually that high in 

3919
03:00:21,711 --> 03:00:23,580
saturated fat compared to dairy or 
cheese or butter.

3920
03:00:23,690 --> 03:00:28,690
So much misinformation,
so many people spout out this 

3921
03:00:28,690 --> 03:00:28,690
misinformation as fact too.
It's just.

3922
03:00:28,690 --> 03:00:30,960
It's so frustrating.
It is frustrating.

3923
03:00:30,961 --> 03:00:35,400
The other thing is that people actually 
will notice there's a problem in there.

3924
03:00:36,030 --> 03:00:41,030
If they're eating a lot of saturated fat
and they have one of these 

3925
03:00:41,030 --> 03:00:41,030
polymorphisms,
they start to gain weight.

3926
03:00:41,030 --> 03:00:42,170
They start to have bad lipid profile.
They start to end.

3927
03:00:42,171 --> 03:00:44,070
They're like,
they know like what I've been doing this

3928
03:00:44,071 --> 03:00:45,660
I measured,
I know it's bad.

3929
03:00:45,661 --> 03:00:48,240
Well,
they don't realize it's possibly because

3930
03:00:48,241 --> 03:00:49,830
they have one of those gene 
polymorphisms.

3931
03:00:49,980 --> 03:00:54,980
If they increase their,
their poly unsaturated mono and 

3932
03:00:54,980 --> 03:00:54,980
saturated fat may actually not be a 
problem,

3933
03:00:54,980 --> 03:00:58,680
but in cholesterol in and of itself is 
not a bad thing.

3934
03:00:58,860 --> 03:01:02,740
It's not no cholesterol.
You need cholesterol.

3935
03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:04,480
You need it.
You need it.

3936
03:01:04,481 --> 03:01:06,610
Like I said,
your own body's production of it,

3937
03:01:06,880 --> 03:01:09,310
but you also need to take some in.
Yes,

3938
03:01:09,550 --> 03:01:10,300
exactly.
Well,

3939
03:01:10,420 --> 03:01:13,780
taking in dietary cholesterol doesn't 
even raise your body's cholesterol.

3940
03:01:13,781 --> 03:01:16,150
Saturated fat will raise your body's 
cholesterol.

3941
03:01:16,480 --> 03:01:18,370
Dietary cholesterol from eggs doesn't 
like.

3942
03:01:18,410 --> 03:01:20,370
It's like nothing.
It doesn't do anything wrong.

3943
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:24,770
Michael Shermer bond crash showed that,
so yeah.

3944
03:01:24,771 --> 03:01:29,771
No,
it was taking in dietary cholesterol 

3945
03:01:29,771 --> 03:01:29,771
doesn't even like move the dial for 
your.

3946
03:01:29,771 --> 03:01:34,040
Your body's cholesterol production.
It's so funny because so many people 

3947
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:34,040
think it does.
You know what really moves it?

3948
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:38,140
Stress stress dramatically increases 
cholesterol production.

3949
03:01:38,141 --> 03:01:41,080
You know why?
Because when you're stressed,

3950
03:01:41,081 --> 03:01:43,610
your body makes your stress.
Your body starts to make cholesterol and

3951
03:01:43,900 --> 03:01:48,750
LDL lipoproteins which have cholesterol 
in them because it stops up.

3952
03:01:50,090 --> 03:01:55,090
It stops up what's called endotoxin,
which is released when you're stressed 

3953
03:01:55,090 --> 03:01:58,951
or inflamed and you want your.
You want to stop it up because it can 

3954
03:01:58,951 --> 03:02:01,921
cause lots of damage.
So you start to make cholesterol and 

3955
03:02:01,921 --> 03:02:01,921
what ends up happening is when you're 
inflamed,

3956
03:02:02,710 --> 03:02:07,710
your body will turn off the production.
It basically starts making something 

3957
03:02:07,710 --> 03:02:10,510
called [inaudible],
which is important to make these.

3958
03:02:10,790 --> 03:02:15,790
You know,
these are very low dense particle ally 

3959
03:02:15,790 --> 03:02:18,780
proteins I was talking about,
but what it also does is it inhibits 

3960
03:02:18,780 --> 03:02:23,760
your body from being able to metabolize 
fat with the exception of medium chain 

3961
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:25,690
triglycerides because it inhibits the 
transporter.

3962
03:02:25,840 --> 03:02:29,080
This transporter on Mitochondria called 
cpt.

3963
03:02:29,560 --> 03:02:33,280
That is inhibited when your body's 
inflamed because it's making that Melano

3964
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:35,110
Kobe and when that transporter is 
inhibited,

3965
03:02:35,680 --> 03:02:40,680
your polyunsaturated,
you're saturated all like 99 percent of 

3966
03:02:40,680 --> 03:02:42,520
the dietary fat you take in is not 
getting used,

3967
03:02:42,550 --> 03:02:46,000
so it gets stored or it starts.
It's like you have fatty acids into your

3968
03:02:46,001 --> 03:02:49,090
bloodstream and can raise triglycerides 
and things so it can be really bad,

3969
03:02:49,360 --> 03:02:52,060
but MCTs bypass that.
Mcts don't need that transporter.

3970
03:02:52,780 --> 03:02:56,050
We just blew through three hours again.
That's awesome.

3971
03:02:56,140 --> 03:02:59,680
Lou,
through it feels like it was 20 minutes.

3972
03:02:59,950 --> 03:03:02,620
It's crazy.
It's really crazy.

3973
03:03:02,790 --> 03:03:04,740
Yeah.
These are ridiculous conversations.

3974
03:03:05,070 --> 03:03:06,540
Thank you very much.
You're awesome.

3975
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:07,530
Thanks Joe.
As always,

3976
03:03:07,531 --> 03:03:11,130
I'm going to have to go over this 50 
times with a notebook to try to get half

3977
03:03:11,131 --> 03:03:13,890
of it.
Found my fitness.com,

3978
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:16,770
found my fitness on twitter.
What else?

3979
03:03:16,800 --> 03:03:17,910
Yeah,
the genetic tool.

3980
03:03:17,911 --> 03:03:20,970
I've got people can check that out,
found my fitness.com

3981
03:03:20,971 --> 03:03:23,580
forward slash genetics,
and then I've got a podcast on itunes,

3982
03:03:23,730 --> 03:03:25,320
did the cryotherapy.
I talk all about that.

3983
03:03:25,321 --> 03:03:26,640
I've got some.
How do they get to that?

3984
03:03:26,641 --> 03:03:28,800
What is it on itunes?
What's it called?

3985
03:03:28,830 --> 03:03:30,260
Found my fitness.
Good.

3986
03:03:30,440 --> 03:03:32,580
Sticking with one brand.
Yeah.

3987
03:03:33,330 --> 03:03:34,500
Thank you so much.
You're awesome.

3988
03:03:34,870 --> 03:03:37,980
Can't say enough things.
So those are the best conversations.

3989
03:03:37,981 --> 03:03:40,920
I look forward to them and I'm really,
really appreciative that you do these.

3990
03:03:41,320 --> 03:03:43,710
Thank you so much.
Bye everybody.

3991
03:03:52,740 --> 03:03:53,270
Yes.
