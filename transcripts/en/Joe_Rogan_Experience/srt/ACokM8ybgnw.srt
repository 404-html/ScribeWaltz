1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,710
So I've never been to woodland hills.
It's a rare land.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,050
The land of would it smells like money?
Does it out here really?

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,210
It smells like like white people where 
white people come to breed.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,590
Hank shot.
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:18,591
we're live D.
Hank Shaw said woodland hills smells 

6
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:18,591
like money.
You've got to go to Beverly Hills.

7
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:23,271
It smells like diamond.
They don't let people like me and they 

8
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:23,271
don't know.
Come on man.

9
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:24,060
You look respectable.
Barely.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,400
Are you looking fine?
You're a chef.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,310
How do you go from being a political 
blogger?

12
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:34,311
You are political blogger.
That was a political capital bureau 

13
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:35,100
chief in Sacramento in another places in
covered congress.

14
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,650
So a bit more than a blogger.
But you are deep in.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,740
Oh yeah.
I always in the room several times 

16
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,900
watching this thing go down now this 
atrocity of justice and voting and chaos

17
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,750
and all,
everything that's going around,

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,710
the Russians are attacking all this 
stuff that's going on right now.

19
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:52,200
What?
What does this feel like to you?

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,600
It feels so good to not be doing this 
job anymore.

21
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,970
I just,
I feel like anybody that has any sort of

22
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:04,971
intelligence that is a political blogger
that's involved in it for any length of 

23
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:08,310
time or not as political blogger and 
columnist and author.

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,730
After awhile you got to realize you're,
you're fucking writing about pro 

25
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,820
wrestling.
This is a rig system.

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,970
You're writing about a rigged system and
then occasionally something like this 

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,000
happens.
It used to be,

28
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:21,720
I mean,
what got me into,

29
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,670
I did for 18 years,
wow.

30
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,130
I got into it because when I got into 
it,

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,280
the essence of politics with people of 
different kinds of backgrounds and 

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,160
persuasions or different regions would 
all meet in a room.

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,250
I either capital either as a state 
capitol Congress and solve a problem 

34
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,481
somehow.
So it was all about compromise and 

35
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:41,481
debate and wheeling and dealing and that
kind of stuff.

36
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:45,771
Which is inherently fascinating when 
you're a report like whose ox is going 

37
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:45,771
to get cord?

38
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:46,740
Who's going to win this?
And like,

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,930
you know,
joe needs this and somebody else needs 

40
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:51,930
that.
I got to give him this thing.

41
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:51,930
Otherwise I'm not going to do is vote 
and Dah,

42
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:51,930
Dah,
Dah.

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,920
And then the,
at the end of the day,

44
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:54,690
you'd have this bill,
this transportation,

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,720
I mean,
I could go on about some hilarious 

46
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,180
congressional stories and in state 
government stories do.

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,140
So there was a transportation bill 
[inaudible] bill in Congress in 98.

48
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,260
And one of my guys,
a guy named Frank Wolf,

49
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,210
he was a,
is a lawmaker from northern Virginia.

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,520
He's not there anymore.
He used kind of a do gooder,

51
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,830
you know,
kind of a reformer Republican guy,

52
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:20,060
you know,
Dudley direct kind of guy and he wanted,

53
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,400
he hated pork and want to get rid of all
the earmarks in transportation bill.

54
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,430
But as you probably know,
the transportation bill is what they 

55
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:28,430
call a Christmas tree.

56
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,130
So everybody gets a little bit of an 
ornament on top of the tree so that they

57
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,960
can go home to their district and say,
look what I got.

58
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,500
So Bud,
Schuster of Pennsylvania with the head 

59
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:39,500
of the transportation committee back 
then.

60
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,560
So Bud,
uh,

61
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,670
would shut the door and anybody in the 
transportation committee with one of 

62
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:46,670
Bud's boys,
you are a Republican,

63
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,180
you want a Democrat,
you one of Bud's boys.

64
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,080
And so they all play a game like this 
and so except for my guy,

65
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,120
my guy would come out and hold press 
releases saying,

66
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,470
oh,
are,

67
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:55,680
you know,
it was a terrible,

68
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,720
you know,
this is,

69
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,540
this is corruption,
blah,

70
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,170
blah blah.
Now the game is played,

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,000
you know,
everybody gets it.

72
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,220
Everybody gets a little piece.
So it comes out and the bill passes over

73
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,340
frank's dead body basically,
and he holds a press release or a press 

74
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,800
conference talking about how terrible it
all was.

75
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,370
And I'm coming out of this press 
conference and one of Bud Schuster's 

76
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:17,370
aids comes and says,
hey,

77
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,190
check out page.
I can't remember.

78
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,610
It was a page 123 of the bill.
So I did.

79
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,820
And in there was a line item that gave 
the residents of Bud Schuster's 

80
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:32,461
congressional district a free pass to 
drive the Pennsylvania turnpike for x 

81
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:38,431
number of years.
So basically anybody who lived in Bud's 

82
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:39,370
district didn't have to pay tolls for,
I think it was two years.

83
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,550
Awesome.
That's ridiculous.

84
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,630
Well,
there was a reason because,

85
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:43,970
uh,
the,

86
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:48,971
the,
the road that most of those people took 

87
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:51,301
to work was being,
there was going be construction on it 

88
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:51,301
for like the next two years.

89
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:51,620
Oh,
well that's fairly reasonable.

90
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:55,760
Then you could justify it in front of a 
court of law is not completely,

91
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,580
but you know,
I mean cases where like,

92
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:00,170
yeah,
check out into page 423.

93
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,790
We stuck something in there that's still
going on too.

94
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,810
I mean that,
that's what's so bizarre that even in 

95
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,881
this age of transparency,
there's still like stacking stuff in 

96
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:10,760
sliding things into bills and there's 
very few people to watch them now.

97
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,910
Yes.
And there's too many things to look at 

98
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,910
anyway,
even if there is something.

99
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,700
Yeah,
something does get in,

100
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,100
there's gonna be some new scandal 
tomorrow.

101
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:24,920
Kanye west going to be visiting trump at
the trump tower and that like,

102
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,330
you're not going to think about the bill
anymore.

103
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Exactly.
There's too much to pay attention to 

104
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,131
Hank Shaw,
which is why I find it fascinating that 

105
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,681
you went from that world too,
like much more of an artistic pursuit of

106
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:37,370
being a chef.

107
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,000
And that's something that I've really 
come to appreciate over the last,

108
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:45,680
say 10 years or so.
And I credit the initial push to,

109
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:46,820
uh,
watching,

110
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,860
uh,
no reservations when Anthony Bourdain 

111
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:51,860
show was on the travel channel.
Um,

112
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,050
because I,
I always loved food,

113
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,480
you know,
I,

114
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,690
I like eating.
Everybody does,

115
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:59,330
you know,
but I never really thought of dieticians

116
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,590
don't like eating.
Which,

117
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,570
which ones are your dieticians?
They don't,

118
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:03,580
they don't like it.
Well,

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,570
they don't like the pleasure aspect of 
it.

120
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,350
They want everybody to just say like,
if there's a fucking guy that I know,

121
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,740
there's like a,
I don't eat for taste.

122
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:13,610
I eat for performance.
He eats like a oatmeal with water and he

123
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:14,480
doesn't heat it up.
I'm like,

124
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,430
get the fuck Outta here.
You asshole.

125
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,570
Just,
you're missing the point.

126
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,750
You could do both stupid.
But um,

127
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,940
the point being that I didn't think I 
thought of food as being like great.

128
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,520
Like,
oh,

129
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,170
this is good,
I like this.

130
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,820
I didn't think of it as an art and then 
when I watched Anthony Bourdain show,

131
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:39,110
when he would have these great reverence
for these people that he would visit,

132
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,290
who are these real artists and they were
put together these amazing dishes and 

133
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,490
the enthusiasm and the passion that he 
had for describing it made me super 

134
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,010
excited about it.
And then I started realizing,

135
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:51,350
Oh wow,
I never thought about it like this.

136
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,050
This is an art form.
This is just an art form.

137
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,260
Like you know,
in a way that you would like to make a 

138
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,260
sand castle know it's not going to last

139
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,810
forever.
You're making a meal.

140
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,400
You can take a photo of it.
It is not unlike standup comedy in a lot

141
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:04,960
of it's performance art.
Yeah.

142
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:10,230
The last.
For as long as you're in the restaurant 

143
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,230
or as long as you're in that comedy 
hall.

144
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,670
Yeah.
If,

145
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:15,671
if like,
you couldn't record comedy where you 

146
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:15,671
could record

147
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,070
a meal and film it.
Like on Anthony Bourdain shot.

148
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,080
I can't appreciate it at home,
but I could watch you if you did stand 

149
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,050
up and I laughed at home.
I don't have to be there.

150
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,880
That's true.
It,

151
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,090
it,
it serves more people,

152
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:27,500
but in the sense the same way.
Like,

153
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,780
like if there was no

154
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,960
recordings,
it would be kind of very similar and a 

155
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,390
lot of ways but shared for with larger 
groups of people.

156
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,030
Right.
I enjoyed cooking.

157
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,280
When you bring it up to that kind of a 
level,

158
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:38,840
and I still,
I,

159
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,720
I hesitate to use the word artists with,
with cooks and she sounds pretentious.

160
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:45,760
Right?
Were were artisans.

161
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,020
We're craftsman.
Were artists too.

162
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,580
Like what's the difference?
Well,

163
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:55,581
okay,
so there are some people who will say 

164
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,770
that my cooking leaves you with a deep 
feeling of whatever you know,

165
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,570
on Wifi or happiness or joy or parts or 
whatever.

166
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,610
And,
and like,

167
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:04,620
no,
we're cooking good food.

168
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,720
We are buying product,
we're making product and in a way that 

169
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,310
will make you interested in it and will 
delight you in some way,

170
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:13,760
shape or form.
And you know,

171
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,770
there's a famous old,
a Spanish chef whose name escapes me at 

172
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,030
the end of every Michelin Star meal ends
with the good shit

173
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,010
looking it.
I just don't want to take myself that 

174
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,010
seriously.
Well,

175
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,880
good for you.
But that's the same thing as comedians.

176
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:34,330
Like my comedy changes worlds,
changes minds.

177
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,460
It influence.
I mean,

178
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,420
the influencer is,
it's,

179
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:40,210
I think it's important to get my message
out there and use my platform.

180
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,050
No,
dude,

181
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:42,490
you're joking.
You're telling.

182
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,260
You're making people laugh.
I ultimately.

183
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,170
Well,
what comics are freed from that today?

184
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,390
Uh,
in this very unique form because of the 

185
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,270
Internet and because of the podcast.
So because of podcasts,

186
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,760
comics,
if you have,

187
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,990
if you have actually something that you 
want to say that is not necessarily 

188
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,381
funny,
you could do that now because podcasts 

189
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:04,381
are so open ended.
There's no real structure to it.

190
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,240
Whereas like if you go on stage and 
people did for the longest time,

191
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:12,241
they would go on stage and rant about 
the government or about abortion or 

192
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,781
about crime or whatever and it would be 
not funny and they would feel like it 

193
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:15,880
was.

194
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,210
It was something that was important.
So it had to be discussed even though it

195
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:24,211
was discussed in this weird forum where 
people go to pay to see comedy and 

196
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,570
you're not giving them comedy.
You're ranting.

197
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,720
And it was almost like respected under 
like some snobbish sort of sect of 

198
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,210
standup comedy fans and practitioners.
There's a real weird was I blame Bill 

199
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,860
Hicks,
you know Bill Hicks's?

200
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,610
Yeah.
Bill Hicks did it perfectly,

201
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,820
but the way he did it,
he fuck every lot of people imitated it 

202
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,021
to the point where there's a famous,
a comedy club in Georgia called the 

203
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:53,790
punchline that went under and it had a 
back room that the green room where the 

204
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,751
comics would hang out and they'll.
Everybody wrote on the walls and a one 

205
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:59,340
section of this wood paneled wall said,
quit trying to be Hicks.

206
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,350
And uh,
Jamie,

207
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:03,780
the owner says it's going to get me that
because they tore it down.

208
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,350
They saved that.
Those pieces.

209
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,360
Put it up in here.
Someone by by all means make a statement

210
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:10,680
but make it funny.
Yeah,

211
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:12,000
man,
that's where it's hard.

212
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,230
It's hard to do that.
But.

213
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:18,231
So some people like took the shortcut 
and they just want it to be self 

214
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:18,360
righteous.
It's hard to do molecular gastronomy and

215
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:23,361
make it actually soulful molecular 
gastronomy is when he's calling cooking 

216
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,050
ladies and gentlemen.
Not now my cooking,

217
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:27,150
but tweezers,
foams,

218
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,770
verification,
calcium,

219
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:29,770
lactate,
all that kind of.

220
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,860
What is that all about?
Like some people go too deep,

221
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:32,940
right?
Yeah.

222
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,420
Well you kind of the opposite.
You're like,

223
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,380
one of the things that I've really 
enjoyed about seeing some of your dishes

224
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:44,040
that you like to cook.
Things like say if you're cooking like a

225
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:49,041
wild pork Loin,
you want to use a lot of the ingredients

226
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,810
that are in the area where that animal 
lives.

227
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,540
Yeah.

228
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,940
I'm not the first person to do that,
but it's one of the things that I do a 

229
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,241
lot of what goes together in the field 
or in the water and the seashore or 

230
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:07,151
whatever,
almost always will go together and on 

231
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:07,490
the plate.
So I mean,

232
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:09,410
I've gotten to.
It's weird stuff is,

233
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:10,760
you know,
when I go grouse hunting,

234
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,900
well,
what were the graphs eating?

235
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,120
You can tell what was in the product and
like,

236
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,760
I'll never forget there was this moment 
in um,

237
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,980
we are in North Dakota hunting sharp 
tailed grouse and the graphs had all 

238
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,040
been eating rose hips.
So I'm like,

239
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:27,100
I've got gotta make a rose hip glaze on 
these sharpies of rose hip Glenn.

240
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,380
What does rose hips taste like?
Um,

241
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,750
they're a little bit like a,
well,

242
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:38,640
they're loaded with vitamin C so they 
have that kind of acidy toying to them,

243
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:39,550
but

244
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,270
there

245
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,630
like imagine a cross between a 
watermelon and an orange or something 

246
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:48,980
like that.
That's what rose hips tastes like.

247
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,340
Why don't we just buy rose hips to the 
store and eat them?

248
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,030
Uh,
because the center of a rose hip is what

249
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,340
they used to make itching powder out of.
That's what it looks like,

250
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,990
Jamie.
I'm looking at.

251
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,460
That's,
that's a rose hip.

252
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,100
It's a fruit.
It,

253
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,000
it's,
it's the end of the rose.

254
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,550
And I mean that's what a bit rose 
becomes really.

255
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,380
There's a variety called A.
Yeah.

256
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,200
How the fuck do I not know this?
I have roses.

257
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,820
Well,
they don't all,

258
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,020
they don't always get pollinated.

259
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,850
Oh.

260
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,810
So when they get pollinated,
the best one is called a regresa rose.

261
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,230
And it is a,
it's a coastal reslizumab beaches and 

262
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,920
dunes and the roasted there.
It's like the size of a cherry pepper.

263
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,450
It's like that.
Wow.

264
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,680
Yeah.
That's something that's solid,

265
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,580
you know,
half dollar size.

266
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,190
People remember what half dollar looks 
like.

267
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,090
It's that big and it's juicy,
like a,

268
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,300
like a sweet pepper,
but you don't eat the center because the

269
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,890
center is what they used to make itching
powder out of

270
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,550
itching powder.
Oh Jesus Christ.

271
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,400
So it's like one of those kind of eat 
around the edge,

272
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,480
low fish that can kill you,
like kind of a deal.

273
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,730
But it just,
it's not that bad.

274
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,700
No.
But the outside's Yummy.

275
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,730
Yeah.
Wow.

276
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,750
Fucking how bizarre.
Put that photo up again.

277
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,210
I literally had no idea that they looked
like that center part is nasty.

278
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,770
Nasty.
Now if it dries in you,

279
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,610
um,
so what?

280
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:08,680
I make a roasted puree.
So get these,

281
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,940
that kind of rose hip and dry it and um,
and then you rehydrate it and then you 

282
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:17,200
boil it just to get it soft and then you
run it through a food mill.

283
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,280
And so only the red flesh comes through 
and all those seeds stay in the food 

284
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,871
mill and you get this incredibly amazing
looking paste that looks exactly like 

285
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:27,370
tomato paste,
but it's like concentrated roset flavor.

286
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,500
Oh.
And it's ridiculously good.

287
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Wow.
And that's what is that back there to 

288
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:34,920
back that up one,
Jeremy?

289
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,270
That's like a puree or something.
Is that like how they would make that?

290
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,910
W would grind that up in some sort of a 
way?

291
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:40,630
It's probably,
yeah,

292
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:41,890
it's probably the extract.
I mean,

293
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,970
they make jellies out of it a lot and 
um,

294
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,510
the,
the,

295
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,860
the Swedes and Norwegians make um,
fruit soup out of it.

296
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,370
How do I not know this,
this,

297
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,380
this.
So I really thought rose hips were 

298
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,380
somehow or another,
like a rose leaf.

299
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,710
I thought you'd take like the.
Because I know those things must taste 

300
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,590
good because deer eat them like crazy.
Oh yeah.

301
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,580
They,
they like.

302
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,770
My friend's wife was like,
oh,

303
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:04,270
I love animals.
It's so cute.

304
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:09,271
We have deers in the same way.
They started planning the roses,

305
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,890
the deer Cape beat the rose and she's 
like,

306
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,390
these fucking cuts need to die.

307
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,840
Kill them,
kill them off.

308
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,450
So his.
I saw his wife literally wants to murder

309
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,130
these deer because they're killing her 
flowers.

310
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,150
It's fun.
It's like 100.

311
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,500
We need a tag.
Yeah.

312
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,800
Going to try to get a tag for Malibu,
Malibu.

313
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,550
Lots of luck.
I know.

314
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,580
Malibu.
Just granted a stay.

315
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:40,120
A pardon on that mountain lion who's 
been killing all the alpacas up there.

316
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,640
And I heard that story.
No,

317
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,650
but it's awesome.
It's a fascinating story because there 

318
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:46,650
is a mountain,
mine's name is p 45.

319
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,910
He's actually been collared and they 
know who he is,

320
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:53,911
they know he's an active Radio Colorado,
so they know it's him and he's just 

321
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:57,610
murking these alpacas.
He killed was 11 alpacas and stupidest 

322
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,130
slow as dear I've ever.
Chest cage.

323
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,040
He does opposite fence.
It has a slaughter fest.

324
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,390
I mean,
he's not even eating them.

325
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:05,820
He's just fucking them up,
you know,

326
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,460
I think he's plenty of food up there.

327
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,470
He's just decided to eat them because 
they were killed them because they were 

328
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,310
there.
And so they decided that they could pay,

329
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,060
they could,
uh,

330
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,000
pass a,
um,

331
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,150
depredation permit so they're going to 
kill him.

332
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,100
And so then in this outrage and the 
woman who owns the Alpaca farm account,

333
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,200
apparently it was like really scared 
because she was like,

334
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:31,000
I just wasn't prepared for the vitriol.
And so now she doesn't want it killed.

335
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,520
She's not going to use the depredation 
order.

336
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:38,521
She's instead wants someone to somehow 
or another take it away and put it 

337
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:39,840
somewhere else.
Probably up in nor cal where I live.

338
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,390
I've seen five mountain lions wandering 
around in the wild.

339
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,720
I mean we throw around.
Oh,

340
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:45,230
there's a lot.
There's one today.

341
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,480
They kitties.
There's once a day,

342
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:49,900
a video they put up of this guy in his 
home,

343
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,140
looks out on his front porch and there's
a fucking mountain lion killing a deer 

344
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,140
on his front porch.

345
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,110
It was just put out today.
Did you see a jamie?

346
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,590
You see that one is crazy.
I mean it's.

347
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:04,040
It's in a suburban neighborhood is a big
cat too and it's just dragging this deer

348
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,690
on his,
on his front porch.

349
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,710
Like,
whoa.

350
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,720
Jesus Christ.
Here it is.

351
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,930
Like this is this guy security.
The mountain lion was caught on camera 

352
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,620
Thursday attacking a deer to residents.
Front porch in Sanford,

353
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,240
San Francisco.
Yes.

354
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,270
Watch.
Look at this and this is fucking San 

355
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,710
Francisco.
San Francisco is dragging the deer way.

356
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,470
This is crazy.
That's amazing.

357
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:30,350
Because both of us have been to San 
Francisco.

358
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,900
That thing must be living in golden gate
park.

359
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Well,
the crazy part came up from the 

360
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:38,920
peninsula where there's a fair bit of 
habitat for it.

361
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,610
It's very strange what they're able to 
do and how they're able to move around.

362
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,040
They're just so smart of the deer had 
been eaten.

363
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Rosa say fuck them sometimes you got to 
pay rent amount.

364
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,460
Mountain Lion inspired by the fucking 
rose owners.

365
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,930
The Jack.
The deer.

366
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,520
Yeah.
It's up there.

367
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,550
It's amazing how they can get around.
They killed a giant one in Santa Monica 

368
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,930
in someone's backyard.
Santa Monica was just like deeply 

369
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:07,930
populated and uh,
this,

370
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,850
this guy called up the police I guess 
and said,

371
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:12,860
hey,
there's a fucking giant mountain lion in

372
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:14,630
my yard.
And they couldn't figure it out.

373
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:15,520
How to get it out of there.
This,

374
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,210
they killed it.
It was,

375
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,400
you know,
150 pound cat in Santa Monica just 

376
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,400
wandering.
Pretty big.

377
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,410
They get bigger.
Do they be really 100?

378
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,610
Do they get to go?
Yeah.

379
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,620
That's a giant big kitty.
You see them in like Utah.

380
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,130
Well,
I was listening to this podcast 

381
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:33,130
yesterday where this,
uh,

382
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,190
they were talking about spotting Jaguars
in Arizona.

383
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,780
They're spotting and more and more 
lately,

384
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,050
especially the spotted a couple of them 
now and in the south.

385
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,290
And that to in Texas to really very 
southern part of Texas.

386
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,420
It's so interesting.
It's so.

387
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,980
It's like part of you is like,
yeah,

388
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:47,090
that's cool.
They're coming back.

389
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,590
You're part of them was like,
it's cool.

390
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,150
As long as there's only a couple of 
them.

391
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,450
Right.
You don't want too many jaguars were 

392
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:55,450
running around where the kids are 
playing.

393
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,270
It's like sea lions.
I have nothing against the lions,

394
00:16:56,271 --> 00:17:01,271
but there aren't enough great white 
sharks to make the sea lion population 

395
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:05,141
kind of normal.
So we're just blitzed with sea lions up 

396
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:07,871
in northern California.
Have you ever seen the video that they 

397
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:07,980
took of people?
Right on fisherman's wharf?

398
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,760
He took his Mahi Mahi.
It's.

399
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,310
No,
no,

400
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:10,680
no.
The,

401
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,050
the,
the.

402
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:16,070
They're killing seals or sea lions.
They're killing seals and fisherman's 

403
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:16,070
wharf,
giant,

404
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,200
huge sharks.
Sharks.

405
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,410
Murking these sea lions right next to 
the fisherman's wharf.

406
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,770
So these people were there filming and 
then see that while they're hanging out 

407
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:26,990
here is right.
Yeah,

408
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,960
exactly.
Yeah.

409
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,950
These people are hanging out and like,
yeah,

410
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:31,670
yeah.
Well,

411
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:32,580
you know,
we're just going to.

412
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:33,720
Oh Shit,
boom.

413
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,690
I look at all the blood in the water,
I mean,

414
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:41,691
then they all come to the,
to the side of the edge to look over 

415
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:45,140
over the edge of the dock.
And I guess this is a security camera 

416
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,320
that's on this boat.
It's filming this,

417
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:47,120
but if you look at all the fucking 
blood,

418
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,070
yeah,
this

419
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,100
one's rapidly cooling.
Um,

420
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,280
I've caught all kinds of sharks.
You see where the,

421
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,440
uh,
that power boat is in the background.

422
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,550
Go about 150 yards towards Alcatraz or 
you know,

423
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:04,680
or actually as towards Angel Island.
Um,

424
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,290
and uh,
and there are seven guild sharks,

425
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:07,920
big,
big,

426
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,580
big seven guild sharks that live in that
channel.

427
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:14,581
What's under d?
Seven guild sharks at different type of 

428
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:14,581
shark.
It is,

429
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:14,700
it's a really,
really primitive kind of shark.

430
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:16,810
They're actually quite tasty.
Um,

431
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:21,950
and you're allowed one a day and they 
cruise the bottom and the deep channels 

432
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,361
in San Francisco Bay,
that's actually one of the best places 

433
00:18:26,361 --> 00:18:26,361
to catch them outside of New Zealand.
Um,

434
00:18:26,361 --> 00:18:27,690
how deep is.
That can be over a hundred.

435
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,890
So you just trolled the bottom or you 
just draw a line down a either anchor up

436
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,660
or you already bounced bottom.
Oh Wow.

437
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:34,740
What a cool looking shark.

438
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,550
Yeah,
the crazy looking.

439
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,410
Wow.
They do look really primitive.

440
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,510
You know,
it's interesting.

441
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:42,600
Sharks because of the whole shark fin 
soup controversy.

442
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,300
This,
which is not good by the way,

443
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:47,790
if you've ever had it.
I have had it once and I'm like,

444
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:48,900
no,
thank you.

445
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,710
It was okay.
I mean,

446
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,860
it wasn't anything that I think you 
should slaughter sharks.

447
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:55,440
Precisely.
Especially not just the fin,

448
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:56,940
like it's so bizarre.
Worse.

449
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,550
There's so much meat on a shark.
The single worst,

450
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,700
you know,
but what I was going to say is that 

451
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,741
there's this new sort of liberal knee 
jerk reaction to sharks that now you're 

452
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:10,890
not supposed to kill sharks.
So there was a,

453
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,110
I think it was the mayor of New York 
City,

454
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,230
or was it the governor that caught a 
thresher shark and it's not an 

455
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,030
endangered species.
It's a totally legal fish to catch.

456
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:26,031
And you'll see him at fish markets and 
he caught it and cooked it and people 

457
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,511
just jumped on the outrage train and 
started getting angry that he was 

458
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:29,670
killing endangered sharks.

459
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,270
And there was like,
well blah,

460
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:30,490
blah,
blah,

461
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:30,750
blah,
blah,

462
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,890
blah.
This is not.

463
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,970
We're not making shark fin soup.
We're not some gigantic Chinese 

464
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,070
commercial fishing vehicle right.
Here it is.

465
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,800
New York governor in hot water over 
sharp photo.

466
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,220
And that's a little fresher to.
It's totally legal.

467
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,250
Yeah.
So it's a fish.

468
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,450
I mean,
it's not a fish,

469
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,800
it's a shark,
but it's,

470
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:47,340
uh,
it's,

471
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,080
it's no different.
I mean,

472
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,720
it's what I mean,
I get that a lot because,

473
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,740
um,
I fish for leopard sharks in San 

474
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:56,970
Francisco Bay and Tamales Bay,
they're delicious.

475
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:58,910
They're fantastic.
And everyone gets.

476
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,390
I get the same reaction,
but I'm like,

477
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:00,890
wait,
wait,

478
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:01,150
wait,
wait,

479
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,550
wait.
First of all,

480
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,630
they're a species of least concern if 
you look at all the fish monitoring 

481
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,580
things or whatever.
And we're keeping like for,

482
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,790
for the whole season.
And because they can get reasonably big 

483
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:16,790
and they're there,
it's just,

484
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,501
it's the,
it's the common shark that lives up 

485
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:21,501
there.

486
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:23,540
And everybody,
I think that when you get down to it as 

487
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,510
Americans are not very good at nuance,
right.

488
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,520
And you know,
it's like,

489
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,070
oh well one sharks endangered so they 
all must be endangered.

490
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,060
I was like,
no.

491
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Well there's a very cursory glimpse at 
the facts and what it,

492
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:40,490
what they're going to get outraged at 
before they decide to pull the outrage 

493
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:40,490
shoot.
They're just like,

494
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:40,770
pull it,
pull it.

495
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,070
He's got a shark.
It eop outrage.

496
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,200
They just,
they don't,

497
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,740
I,
I mean there's not enough time in the 

498
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,940
day to really pay attention to all the 
different animals that are being 

499
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,261
consumed and how you,
what you should be concerned with and 

500
00:20:58,261 --> 00:20:58,261
whatnot.
So you think,

501
00:20:58,261 --> 00:21:01,390
I think I read somewhere that sharks are
endangered and he's got a sharp hey man,

502
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,840
fuck you.
And they just say filet of fish.

503
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:09,841
And there's namec eating fries,
cooked in beef fat as there were on the 

504
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:10,120
way over there.

505
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,170
Which are good by the way.
Yeah,

506
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:14,490
they're great.
But these leopard sharks now,

507
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,500
what is the difference in like,
I've had Makos the only shark I've ever 

508
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,520
eaten.
What would you say a leopard would be?

509
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,790
Dramatically different because makers 
and treasures are much more like 

510
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:26,790
swordfish.
So if I were swordfish,

511
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,310
sturgeon makers and threshers all kind 
of on the same culinary bucket,

512
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,730
they're like a steak,
like a thick mia.

513
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,750
I liked that.
A lot of people don't though,

514
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,510
right?
Some people don't know,

515
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,990
you know,
no accounting for taste,

516
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,620
but a leopard sharks.
But you have down here in cal,

517
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,260
um,
leopard shark is super,

518
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,640
super white.
Uh,

519
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,130
it's very dense.
Um,

520
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,250
it's a little bit more like grouper is 
interesting.

521
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,750
It's an amazing now.
I mean,

522
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:57,751
there's a trick to it.
So if you're going to fit for these 

523
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:57,751
fish,
you need to have ice on board,

524
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:02,040
um,
and you need to basically catch the 

525
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,040
fish.

526
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,040
You kill the fish.
Um,

527
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,160
and then you got the fish right there 
and then you'd get them on ice because 

528
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,660
Sharks Skates and rays effectively pee 
through their skin.

529
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,130
So.
So if you don't get the fish right after

530
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:18,280
you kill it,
you get this buildup of uric acid in the

531
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:23,281
meat.
And it's basically your fish filets 

532
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:23,281
going to smell like ammonia,
which nobody likes.

533
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:24,490
So that's,
that's interesting.

534
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,160
Skates and rays are the same as well.
So all three,

535
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:30,420
I think if I remember,
they're a less.

536
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,850
I'm going to forget.
It's a plasma allows momorphism I forgot

537
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:37,450
what the scientific name is,
but it's the cartilaginous fish now.

538
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,320
The variations and sharks.
That's a very extreme variation.

539
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:43,820
The difference between like a grouper 
and a swordfish,

540
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,520
which is like a real thick midi wha.
What,

541
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:48,430
what accounts for that diet?
Diet.

542
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:49,270
Yeah.
Um,

543
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,670
leopard sharks,
like the crabs,

544
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,580
crustaceans,
a shellfish,

545
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,210
that sort of thing.

546
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,390
Although they actually really,
really dig this nasty little fish called

547
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:00,430
a midshipman.
Um,

548
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,050
which is this.
It looks like a,

549
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,160
the ugliest catfish you've ever seen.
And here's a pro tip for you.

550
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,220
The best bait to catch a leopard shark 
is what was ever in the previous leopard

551
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:11,920
sharks.
Stomach.

552
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,350
Just Bait your hook up with whatever was
in his stomach.

553
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,390
And then you will absolutely catch 
another leopard shark.

554
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,730
And this is the mid shipment.
Yeah,

555
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,200
midshipman strange looking fish as well.
The other good thing about them is not 

556
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
only to the sharks love them,
but they stay on the hook forever,

557
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,770
that they like have a thick outer shell 
or something and see the luminescent 

558
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,770
dots on the bottom and that's pretty 
cool.

559
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,540
Wow.
What a cool looking thing.

560
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,750
How big those things get well about like
that,

561
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,780
but that's it.
So they're essentially just tiny bait 

562
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,870
fish you can get maybe 10 inches long.
Maybe.

563
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,900
What a cool looking fish though.
That's so prehistoric looking as a 

564
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,081
little way I can get to skate.
He would go back to that other thing 

565
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:52,081
again.

566
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,010
Yeah.
Look at that thing.

567
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,320
That's a little bioluminescent dots 
underneath it.

568
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,500
So in deep deep water,
that thing that's all visible.

569
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,980
It's like racing stripes and all those.
A tricked out sports cars,

570
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,460
you know,
the maximum.

571
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,410
Like my sneakers,
like if you ran either these things like

572
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:11,480
you see them at night.
Oh I think when I'm talking about.

573
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:12,770
Yeah.
Well they reflect.

574
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:13,530
Yeah.
So that's cool.

575
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,440
Well that actually is like luminescent 
though.

576
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:16,790
It's not it.
It reflects light.

577
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,560
Yeah,
it actually exudes light.

578
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,270
Right.
Wow.

579
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,790
That's a trip.
That's.

580
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I am as fascinated by the ocean as any 
other part of the world and I just think

581
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:33,401
it's so incredible that we've only 
explored like 92 percent or something 

582
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:36,370
ridiculous like that.
I think 90 something percent is unknown,

583
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,420
unexplored,
so strange.

584
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,610
You go look at that thing.
But it's funny.

585
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,710
I mean I'm known as the Game Guy,
right?

586
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,740
But I've spent most of my life dealing 
with fish and shellfish and seafood and 

587
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:50,770
I only started hunting when I was 30.
That's interesting.

588
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:55,771
Yeah.
Adult onset hunting as many people call 

589
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:55,771
it right now.
Um,

590
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:59,010
when you,
when you cook something like a,

591
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:04,110
uh,
like a shark or anything that's 

592
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,110
controversial,
anything along those lines?

593
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:09,310
Do you feel like you have to preface it 
with some sort of an explanation that 

594
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,491
this is not endangered species and 
they're just a giant misconception and 

595
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:16,511
this is no different than eating a tuna 
or I usually put a paragraph or 

596
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:19,820
something in there to say when you're 
writing something and you'd be like,

597
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,700
hold on people,
this is not,

598
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,260
you know.
Yeah.

599
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,820
So the white shark,
it's not,

600
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,070
you know,
it's not an endangered species at all.

601
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:29,010
I mean just,
you don't,

602
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,860
I'll usually put a link to the,
the word says you can,

603
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,640
is the International Union of concern 
whatevers and it's basically,

604
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:42,641
it's the,
it's the marker that shows what's 

605
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,651
endangered,
what's threatened with a species of 

606
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:44,651
concern.

607
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:44,651
And you know,
even then if you think about it,

608
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:49,571
our,
our bag limit for leopard sharks in the 

609
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:52,931
San Francisco Bay is three a day and we 
typically do a self imposed limit of 

610
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,210
only two a day.
And we almost never keep females.

611
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,820
When you say we,
meaning you and your friends now,

612
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,090
most of the commercial fishing fleet in 
a like,

613
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,350
so if you could take a charter and the 
commercial,

614
00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:09,770
like recreational charter charter boats,
they'll typically like,

615
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,560
do you need three fish?
Like you can have for three fish.

616
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:14,510
But there it's sort of strongly 
encouraged just,

617
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,620
you know,
oh that's cool.

618
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,460
Just take the two and we're going to 
throw these,

619
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,970
these big giant females back because a 
lot of times,

620
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:22,910
especially this time of year,
they,

621
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:27,911
uh,
they can have pups because they give 

622
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:27,911
birth to live young and nobody wants to,
you know,

623
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:29,810
open up a shark.
That's got little pups inside.

624
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:32,660
That's just wrong.
Have you ever seen that?

625
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,750
Is it an x ray or a sonogram of sharks 
with the baby?

626
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,390
Sharks in their stomach.
Now know this,

627
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,190
but most people don't know.
Probably the sharks do

628
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,950
what you say.
You have live young inside of them,

629
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,220
but they're like these.
I put it up on my instagram because it 

630
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,891
looks.
It's so crazy looking that it looks 

631
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:54,891
fake.
It's like they'll little monsters living

632
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:57,180
inside this,
this other sharks body.

633
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,710
See if you can find that.
Well,

634
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:01,680
if you look at a human fetus for days,
look at that.

635
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,470
It isn't his mouth going open.
Oh yeah,

636
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,810
but there's images of it that's better.
Jamie.

637
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,420
There's A.
There's some.

638
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,500
Yeah,
that's it.

639
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,280
Can get a look at what it,
what it looks like.

640
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,750
I mean,
that's fucking crazy.

641
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,500
I mean that's what that.
And some of them eat their fellow 

642
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,040
brothers and sisters inside the womb,
like they'll eat the weaker ones.

643
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,290
That's why you shouldn't have more than 
five kids,

644
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,900
but what the fuck?
How do they eat?

645
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,200
And they're eating inside a womb.
Like what kind of a monster is a shark 

646
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,600
that they can eat while they're in the 
womb and they have teeth already.

647
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,850
They have fangs.
Well,

648
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,890
yeah.
Our human babies of teeth when they're 

649
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:40,890
born,
don't they?

650
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:40,890
No,
no,

651
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,560
that's right.
They don't know.

652
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,180
You don't have kids do?
No,

653
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,340
not that I know of.

654
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,050
He skated through pass the breeding 
point.

655
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:52,440
I'm pretty sure that we'll do a 45 or 
46.

656
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,990
Did you come close at anytime?
Not that I know of.

657
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,830
No.
No.

658
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Good for you.
There's plenty of picking fucking 

659
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,321
people.
That's one thing people with kids will 

660
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:03,321
try to tell you like that.
Everybody needs kids.

661
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:03,720
Like I have kids.
Let me tell you something.

662
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,880
Everybody doesn't need kids.
There's plenty of people.

663
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:11,020
You can be a wonderful contributing 
member to our culture and society 

664
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,020
without reproducing.
Yup.

665
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,930
It's nonsense.
It's not everybody's path.

666
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,140
But one thing about babies is they don't
eat other babies while they're in the 

667
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:18,940
womb that,
you know,

668
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,230
I have to do absorb them though,
don't they?

669
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,980
Like some weird twins.
Oh.

670
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:25,260
Which is weird.
Weird.

671
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,840
A Siamese twins where one twin will 
absorb the other one.

672
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,690
Then they'll find like a tooth in the 
babies.

673
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,940
I've heard about that dermoid,
Ooh,

674
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,300
what's a good name for it?
Be Good enough for a kid.

675
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,500
What's your name?
Dermoid.

676
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,020
But there are a lot of meals now that 
people look up,

677
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,900
look down upon,
and that's becoming one of them,

678
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:46,800
right?
Sharks,

679
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,230
sharks coming.
One of them.

680
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,070
Squirrels and other ones.
Girls mostly.

681
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,290
Mostly,
uh,

682
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,330
urban,
urban and people like to make fun of 

683
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:56,330
rural people for eating squirrels.
It's a sign of like,

684
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:56,580
oh,
you must be a hick.

685
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,480
Well,
if you go to,

686
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,990
there's a park in north Hollywood that a
near where I used to live and you can go

687
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:03,120
there and feed them peanuts.
It's kind of cool.

688
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,770
They come right up to you.
You just lay down.

689
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:07,470
As long as you're laying down,
this girl's would literally lay down and

690
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:12,471
hold up a peanut and the squirrels will 
literally come up to you and take a 

691
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:12,471
peanut.

692
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:15,800
And people feel bad about that.
Like we have weird rules about what 

693
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,280
animals we like and what animals we 
don't.

694
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:19,890
Because if it was a rat that came over 
and took your peanut,

695
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:22,940
you'd be freaking out and there's not a 
whole lot of difference between squirrel

696
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:26,610
and a rat.
The tail dude and adorable.

697
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,280
And it sticks up.
It looks like it's talking to you.

698
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,340
Tree tree rat with a good pr.
Good pr and something about fuzziness.

699
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:36,240
We'll,
we'll let them in.

700
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,820
Come on in.
Come on in as long as you just plants,

701
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,500
you know,
which is not true.

702
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:41,720
Apparently there's a,
uh,

703
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,890
a

704
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,100
video of a squirrel.
They caught eating some sort of a 

705
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,920
mammal,
a mouse or something like that.

706
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,870
Eggs all the time to do that.
Like ground nesting birds as well.

707
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,510
They go into a tree and tree.
Yeah.

708
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,150
Oh Wow.
There it is.

709
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Look at this fucking squirrel.
Then this mouse like python rabbit.

710
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,610
This is so crazy like this happen.
You know,

711
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,790
ground squirrels in California.
Uh,

712
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,860
there are guys.
I don't,

713
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,810
I haven't done it,
but they're,

714
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,450
these guys will go out and shoot ground 
squirrels and then keep that up.

715
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,580
Like when Louis,
when you shoot Louie,

716
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,580
Joe comes out of this hole and grabbed 
and eatsa.

717
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,380
Oh Jesus,
I,

718
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:26,350
it's a little horrible.
Instantaneously.

719
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:27,940
They just started.
I never liked you anyway,

720
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:28,420
you know?
I mean,

721
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,450
it's horrible.
There's a ranch that I go to to hone 

722
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:33,450
ranch.
Oh yeah.

723
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:33,450
Yeah.
And uh,

724
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,210
to hone ranch.

725
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,950
The guy who,
one of the guys was a guide there,

726
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:39,190
told me that the biomass,
this is a morbid senior,

727
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,460
get his square.
We're sitting here talking while the 

728
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,760
squirrel is eating intestines is pretty 
much an entire mouth.

729
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:50,850
Oh my God.
And he's going off to the bio mass of 

730
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,990
ground squirrels.
Is He a ground squirrel?

731
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:57,991
He must be right.
It looks like it was a little squirly 

732
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:57,991
tail.
He does look like a ground squirrel.

733
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:58,700
Yeah.
Squirrel.

734
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,740
A little bastard.
I'm the biomass of ground squirrels is 

735
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,490
more than any other animal on the ranch 
is 270,000

736
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,390
acres with mountain lions,
deer,

737
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,570
elk,
elk,

738
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,800
pigs,
pigs,

739
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,760
and there's more weight of ground 
squirrels and anything else.

740
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,630
And it was,
I would love to be able to tell you 

741
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:21,630
that.
Yeah,

742
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,030
they're delicious,
but they tend to carry bubonic plague,

743
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,490
which does not make them good.
Eats.

744
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,500
Yeah.
You can eat regular squirrels.

745
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:27,430
Be Kenny,
ground squirrels.

746
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,270
Tree squirrels.
Yes.

747
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:28,960
Ground squirrels.
Now,

748
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,200
what is the difference in the species?
Are they interchangeable or the hybrids 

749
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,200
ever?
No,

750
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,740
they're totally different species.
And uh,

751
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:40,150
uh,
the western gray tree squirrel is 

752
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,150
really,
really big.

753
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,350
He's over two pounds and he's kind of a 
very cold slate.

754
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:46,351
Gray and it's actually quite good.
Good hitting squirrel.

755
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,040
Um,
there used to be a very high limit on 

756
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,740
him here in California,
but when Southeast Asian immigrants,

757
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:58,741
the mom came,
so the mom are very fond of squirrel 

758
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:01,030
hunting and so it was a big thing what 
they did back in Southeast Asia.

759
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:06,690
And so when they caught here,
they're like Suede or all these 

760
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,380
squirrels and I guess they shot them out
because they,

761
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,420
uh,
the limits were 10 in the seventies and 

762
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,250
early eighties.
Now they're just for a,

763
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:16,800
which is fairly low.
Uh,

764
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,680
you know,
for example,

765
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:22,240
in some of the Appalachian States is 10.
So That's interesting.

766
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:27,241
The moms,
I've heard that before there a big 

767
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:27,241
hunting community.
Yeah.

768
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:27,241
The of the,
uh,

769
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:31,861
the recent immigrants to this country,
the two homos hunting as groups or the 

770
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:33,130
Hmong and the Russians.
Hmm,

771
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,930
interesting.
And when I say Russians,

772
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,940
Russians,
Ukrainians,

773
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,090
Moldovans,
you know,

774
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,070
do they have a preference for like what 
they

775
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:45,070
go after more?
I know the Russians have been putting a 

776
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,160
hurt on our sturgeon up north sturgeon.
Yeah.

777
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:50,161
Interesting.
And it's mostly poaching and fishing 

778
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:52,340
game is having a hard time getting a 
handle on it now.

779
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:54,740
Do they like sturgeon for the caviar?
For the meat?

780
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:55,580
Yeah,
for the caviar.

781
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,820
So mean,
but that would have to be a female.

782
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:01,350
So how do you differentiate when you 
catching them a.

783
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,390
well you can use and they're pretty slow
there.

784
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,840
They're pretty calm,
slow fish.

785
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:08,990
So it's pretty easy to determine if it's
a male or a female.

786
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,190
Um,
and if it's,

787
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,140
it looks sort of,
they call it gravity,

788
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,900
but um,
it looks pregnant if it's a big female.

789
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,470
And the other thing is I'm there almost 
almost always oversized fish so we're 

790
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,700
allowed three a year in California 
legally and they have to be,

791
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:30,810
oh I'm gonna forget this,
I think it's 40 to 60 inches from the 

792
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:30,810
fork of the tail.

793
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,920
Um,
that might be a slightly off,

794
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:36,921
but that's basically the legal.
How the lyrics is that legal size is 40 

795
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:37,220
inches.
Oh yeah.

796
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:39,200
You have to catch something 40 inches.
Well,

797
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,320
that's a big ass state records I think.
Eight and a half feet long.

798
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,940
Wow.
In California?

799
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,020
Yeah.
It's either eight or 10.

800
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:50,021
It's huge.
The state record was caught by a dude 

801
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,761
and a in Vallejo.
He caught it in the Carquinez straits 

802
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:51,761
and like,
um,

803
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:53,750
I want to say the eighties,
but judging by the haircut now where are

804
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:56,370
they?
Are you catching them in deep water?

805
00:33:56,371 --> 00:33:59,180
Like how you can catch them in 
Sacramento.

806
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:02,000
You can catch the Calusa.
You can catch them in the delta.

807
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,650
Reverse.
What are the end?

808
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,630
Yeah,
they're in rivers there and then they go

809
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:07,220
out into the bay.
Wow.

810
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:12,221
But the general place you're going to 
fish for them is going to be the delta 

811
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:13,970
at Antioch,
at a San Pablo Bay,

812
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,780
that kind of area.

813
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,890
Now these sturgeon are.
Are they biting hooks?

814
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,400
Are you snagging them now?
They're nearby.

815
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,710
They're biting hooks.
What do they get?

816
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:24,440
What they feed.
So depending on who you talk to,

817
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,010
there's a friend of mine named j Dot 
Lopes who runs a guide service or um,

818
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,370
he's a specialist in sturgeon and he 
really loves cured Salmon Roe.

819
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,780
Uh,
so,

820
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:35,010
and he's got some special thing that he 
does with the Salmon Roe,

821
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:38,390
but some people use ghost shrimp,
some people use cut herring.

822
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,210
Um,
they'll eat all kinds of stuff.

823
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,510
The largest freshwater fish on record 
for California is a white sturgeon 

824
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,321
caught by Joey Palato,
the huge fish waiting.

825
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:53,570
Amazing.
Four hundred and 68 pounds.

826
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,230
Whoa.
That's a big fucking fish,

827
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:59,120
man.
That's amazing.

828
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:04,450
That's amazing.
The story of that fish is pretty 

829
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:04,450
hilarious too because he can,
he's a,

830
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,390
he was working these cutoff work at,
you know,

831
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:07,040
so I think it was June or July.

832
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,910
Yeah.
So it was still,

833
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,930
it was still light out late.
So he caught this fish after work and he

834
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:13,400
couldn't get the damn thing in.
So he's like,

835
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,270
it's dragging them all around the 
Carquinez straits and I guess he gets on

836
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:22,271
another boat like mid catch and it was a
bigger boat that could actually control 

837
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:28,241
it because the sturgeon was just 
dragging up and down and it's just the 

838
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:28,241
story.
If you find the story of it,

839
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:32,291
it's just hilarious and that it.
And I'll look at the size of it and it 

840
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:35,801
is a story that will end that,
that fish will never be broken because 

841
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:36,320
that's a.
That would be an illegal fish right now.

842
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:41,350
Why is it illegal?
Because you're not allowed to land 

843
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,700
anything bigger than 60 inches from the 
fork of the tail.

844
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Oh Wow.
Well how the fuck you gonna measure 

845
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,120
that?

846
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,680
Like what if it's like hold on,
get the fish close.

847
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,510
I'm gonna.
Get Out of the ruler.

848
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,800
Like if it's a.
If it's close,

849
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,550
you just cut the lawn.
Well now if it's closed you can.

850
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,790
They're really survivable fish.
They don't die easy.

851
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:59,400
So you can.
I think you bring them on board.

852
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,680
You bring them on board,
measure them and then thrown back.

853
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,230
Huh?
Now,

854
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:07,170
is that a good fish to eat outside of 
the row?

855
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,390
I love sturgeon.
How do you eat it?

856
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:14,870
A sturgeon again,
I would say if you've never eaten 

857
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:14,870
sturgeon,
imagined swordfish.

858
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,210
Oh,
it's a lot like that.

859
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,500
No kids.
It's a signature dish of Sacramento 

860
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,941
cuisine actually.
So if you go to restaurants in 

861
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:22,941
Sacramento,
you will see sturgeon.

862
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:22,941
Oliver,
our menus,

863
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:27,890
people don't know about Sacramento.
Sacramento is so different than 

864
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,000
California in terms of like how it is 
la.

865
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:32,400
People think or you know,
San Diego.

866
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,790
People think Sacramento might as well be
like Iowa.

867
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:36,700
MMM.

868
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,080
Not in a bad way.
I mean,

869
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm not.
I love Iowa.

870
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:45,470
I mean,
I mean in terms of like the hunting and 

871
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:45,470
fishing and the outdoors,
people know

872
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,760
it's more like the twin cities.
Oh,

873
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,070
okay.
That's a good way to put it.

874
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:49,300
Yeah,
like a Minnesota.

875
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,620
Yeah.
Yeah,

876
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,170
that makes sense.
So here's a stat for you that I just,

877
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,200
my uh,
my girlfriend holly told me as she was 

878
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,200
doing some research for a pr piece that 
she was working on.

879
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,510
Ninety five percent of Californians are 
urban.

880
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,410
Ninety five percent of California is 
rural.

881
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,360
Oh,
in that crazy.

882
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,000
That is crazy.
Wow.

883
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,220
And over a third of the state is public 
land.

884
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,590
Really?
Wow.

885
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,780
It's,
it's remarkable.

886
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,520
And it's uh,
you know,

887
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,060
it's why stay here,
that whole public land,

888
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:23,370
private land,
things of

889
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,370
is something that I had literally no 
knowledge of,

890
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:31,420
no interest in,
never discussed until I met Rinella.

891
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,320
And when Rinella started,
Steven Alan started explaining to me the

892
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:40,321
difference between public land and 
private land and how it was all put in 

893
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:42,841
place by Teddy Roosevelt and all the 
conservation that was done in the 18 

894
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:43,030
hundreds and how much resistance was 
behind it.

895
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,000
And he actually talked about a pretty in
depth and I podcast,

896
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:48,480
we did hear a couple of weeks ago and 
uh,

897
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,700
I just,
I can't believe it took me until I was 

898
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:53,700
like 45 until I heard about that.
Uh,

899
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,580
it's,
you know,

900
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,820
Steve's got a really good example of why
you might not necessarily have to.

901
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:04,821
It was because he was talking at the 
back country hunters and anglers and he 

902
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:05,100
had,
he used to live in Brooklyn.

903
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,350
[inaudible] weirdly.
Well,

904
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,900
his wife was working there.
I know just when I met him,

905
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,240
he was still kind of odd,
but uh,

906
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,500
it is,
he's about as Michigan as you get.

907
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,690
Yeah.
Um,

908
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,650
and so he was like,
yeah,

909
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:21,651
well everybody in New York City knows 
can cite you chapter and verse the 

910
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,950
subway lines.
No one who's doesn't have reason to,

911
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,770
has any reason to know about the subway 
lines.

912
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,520
So when somebody who lives in rural 
Montana or whatever,

913
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,580
says,
why haven't you ever know this issue 

914
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:37,580
with public blah blah,
but well,

915
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:37,580
if

916
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:37,600
I live in New York City there,
I don't have to know.

917
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,100
Um,
and it's just like we got,

918
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:45,110
we were saying at the beginning of this,
it's like there's too many things to 

919
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,270
look at.
There's too many distractions in our 

920
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,690
world right now and it's just,
it makes it hard to do anything anymore.

921
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:52,450
There's no quiet at all in our lives 
anymore.

922
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,240
Most people's lives.
Yeah.

923
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,830
Yeah.
That's,

924
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,440
Steve's got a real good way of breaking 
things down like that.

925
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:04,441
He's,
he's got a good way of providing you 

926
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:05,230
with examples that you go,
oh yeah,

927
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,310
that,
that's a good one,

928
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,000
you know,
because yeah,

929
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:12,001
if you lived in Montana you wouldn't 
give a shit about the subway lines at 

930
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:14,581
Brooklyn and if you lived in Brooklyn,
the infringing on public lands or Paul 

931
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,750
Ryan's plan to sell them off to 
corporations so that they could pay off 

932
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,750
the debt.

933
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,840
It doesn't even register.
Well,

934
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:25,390
here's a good one for ya.
So depending on where you live,

935
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
like most of us call it public land.
Other people call it government land was

936
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,950
a very different connotation.
Yeah,

937
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,960
because the government land means it's 
not ours,

938
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,460
but it's really ours.
Right?

939
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,650
So if you call it government land,
seems like,

940
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,390
well if they sell it,
it's not yours anyway,

941
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,090
but it actually is yours,
which is that,

942
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,580
that is a weird one that takes a while 
to absorb.

943
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,240
Like the land is actually the own.
We've the people of the United States or

944
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:53,560
the owners of the land.
Right?

945
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,410
So if you go hunting on public land 
Europe,

946
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,020
Europe,
you know the background of your hunch.

947
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,000
Back country hunters and anglers shirts,
they have,

948
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:06,001
it says public landowner.
I love that shirt because we're all 

949
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:06,001
public land doors.
If you paid taxes,

950
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:07,460
you live in America,
you own public land.

951
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,460
Similarly,
all the game on everybody's playing in 

952
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:12,460
public or private.
Yeah.

953
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,100
Belongs to the ease of the people in the
United States or if its migratory,

954
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,500
the people of Canada,
the United States and Mexico,

955
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,590
or if you're in Texas and it's a high 
fence,

956
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,140
that's legally livestock.
Yeah.

957
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:24,190
That's weird.
Right?

958
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,710
That's.
That's a strange distinction.

959
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,790
The difference between public land and 
private land and the animals being on 

960
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,500
it.
Even if it's private land,

961
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,930
those animals are owned by people.
Right.

962
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:38,410
By the people reading publishes.
Why we actually have deer.

963
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,940
Yeah.
That's the only reason why.

964
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,150
Well,
that large scale agriculture,

965
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,590
the populations are higher than ever 
before and all that good stuff.

966
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,520
Actually,
it's.

967
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:50,521
There's a great book called dear land 
that talks about why if you go to the 

968
00:40:50,521 --> 00:40:51,070
northeast,
they're overrun with white tails because

969
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:55,390
white tails like the edges between field
and forest.

970
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,140
It's suburbia.
Is there perfect habitat for it?

971
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,010
Yeah.
Well,

972
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,510
and the problem that goes with that is 
of course deer ticks and lyme disease,

973
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:06,400
which is run rampant through the 
northeast.

974
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:08,110
It's just stayed as it.
Yeah.

975
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:13,111
Steve has it.
His son has it and they are amongst two 

976
00:41:13,111 --> 00:41:13,200
people out of,
I don't know,

977
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,550
maybe 10 that I've ever met that had 
been misdiagnosed.

978
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:20,970
I had this Guy Steven Kotler on here the
other day who was misdiagnosed for a 

979
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,330
year,
for one fucking year,

980
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:27,331
and because of that it got so deep into 
his system that he was in bed for three 

981
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:27,331
years in the hospital.
Oh Man.

982
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,110
He was hospitalized for three fucking 
years from lyme disease.

983
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,100
Morale is a horror story.
It's so scary.

984
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,640
You know,
when you talk to people that have had 

985
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:39,640
it,
and one of the really fascinating things

986
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:39,640
about Steve,
he's really smart.

987
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,080
Steven Kotler,
and when he was discussing it,

988
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:45,770
he was talking about the neurological 
aspects of lyme disease,

989
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,620
that it really wreaks havoc on your 
cognitive function.

990
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,530
To the point where one time when he had 
it before he was diagnosed,

991
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:56,531
he didn't know what was wrong with him.
He was at a green light and he couldn't 

992
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:56,531
figure out what green met.
Oh Wow.

993
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:57,350
Then he couldn't figure out how to drive
his car.

994
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:02,410
He had a stick shift.
He could not figure out how to do it 

995
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:02,410
anymore.
He didn't know how to drive his car like

996
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:07,090
in the middle of driving.
He forgot how to drive it and it was 

997
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:07,090
like,
oh my God,

998
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:07,730
they're going crazy.
There's something wrong with me.

999
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:10,400
Like bad.
And that's like right before,

1000
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:13,610
I believe you said it was right before 
they checked him into the hospital and I

1001
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:17,890
bet pumped him full of IV antibiotics 
and figured out exactly what it was when

1002
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,940
I play it ticks on me.
But you know,

1003
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:21,260
knock on wood,
I've never had your line,

1004
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:21,860
man.

1005
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:26,860
I wish there was a way to stop it.
Like I wish there doesn't seem to be 

1006
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,551
any.
I think it's in California in 

1007
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:31,760
particular,
it's misdiagnosed a lot because it's not

1008
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:32,780
here yet.
It is.

1009
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,190
They found it in Mendocino,
but it's not in like math.

1010
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

1011
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:40,520
And in the east coast,
they think something like,

1012
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:45,521
I think they were talking about,
I think they were talking about long 

1013
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:45,521
island where they were saying some 
absurd number,

1014
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,050
like 50 percent of the ticks of lyme 
disease.

1015
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,610
There's something crazy.
I went mushroom hunting to summer ago,

1016
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,180
Sogo with,
um,

1017
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,610
a fellowship friend of mine and Anita 
Lo.

1018
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,460
And uh,
so we were at a meeting and by her place

1019
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:01,070
in eastern end of Long Island and uh,
you know,

1020
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:02,180
it took some mushrooms,
had a good time,

1021
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:02,600
blah,
blah blah.

1022
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:08,020
So I get back like 48 hours later I find
to tick nymphs right the right the band 

1023
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:13,520
of my boxers and like,
oh shit.

1024
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,670
And so I immediately rush to the doctor 
and I got that day the basically they 

1025
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,060
give you a three pack of Cipro and he'd 
go boom,

1026
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:20,480
boom,
boom.

1027
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:24,680
And try and knock it out and seemed to 
work to get it quicker.

1028
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,730
Yeah,
you got to get it really quick.

1029
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:30,770
Those little fuckers we see.
I did this show for Scifi called Joe 

1030
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:30,770
Rogan questions,
everything.

1031
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:35,711
And one of the things that we're,
we investigated was this weird disease 

1032
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:36,170
called more Jaylen's.
Have you ever heard of this?

1033
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,430
And not by that name.
Well,

1034
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:40,880
it's a weird.
They think it's a psychosomatic disorder

1035
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:43,070
where these people believe there's 
something wrong with them,

1036
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:48,071
but there's not.
And they have these parts of their body 

1037
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:51,881
where they just itch incessantly and 
they can't stop and then they believe 

1038
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:53,500
fibers are growing out of their body and
they'll get like um,

1039
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,320
carpet hairs in there and they think 
that it's growing out of their body,

1040
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:59,480
you know,
carpet fibers and they're convinced.

1041
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:04,870
But one of the guys that I interviewed 
was a doctor who also had more jealous 

1042
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:09,820
and what he,
he had a really unique insight to it 

1043
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,570
because he said that as a doctor,
one of the things that he found,

1044
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:16,571
this is a direct correlation between 
people who have this disease and lyme 

1045
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,450
disease.
They almost all have lyme disease.

1046
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,350
And he thinks it was really going on is 
that peep.

1047
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,220
And this is a guy who was talking about 
his own,

1048
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:27,221
like his brain malfunctioning on him.
He was saying that people who have lyme 

1049
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:29,960
disease,
that there is some sort of a neuro toxic

1050
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:34,990
effect of lyme disease,
which distorts reality to the point 

1051
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:38,571
where these people think these fibers 
are growing out of them and he was 

1052
00:44:38,571 --> 00:44:40,250
talking about himself like he had saw 
something moving around in his eye,

1053
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,440
like saw something wiggling around on 
the surface of his eye and then it 

1054
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:45,440
wasn't there anymore and he realized 
like,

1055
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,680
okay,
this is not real.

1056
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,840
Like I'm seeing something that's not 
real.

1057
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,110
And then as he got deeper into it,
he found that all these people that had 

1058
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,670
this bizarre morgellons thing also had 
lyme disease.

1059
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,020
Make sense?
I mean,

1060
00:44:58,021 --> 00:44:59,100
if you,
if you know,

1061
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:04,101
you know about the symptoms of 
toxoplasmosis where we should make some 

1062
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:04,800
mice really dig cats.
Yeah.

1063
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:07,470
Well it makes them sexually attracted to
cat urine.

1064
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,360
People don't know what we're talking 
about.

1065
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,440
Google,
Robert Sapolsky from Stanford University

1066
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:15,990
in Northern California,
but try and get that guy on for years.

1067
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:18,720
He's just so not a publicity whore.
He just,

1068
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:19,770
I can't get them on.
I'm like,

1069
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,920
I'll fly to you,
dude.

1070
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:21,600
He's like,
I'm busy.

1071
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,470
I'm like,
fuck,

1072
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,960
he's.
I'm an expert in.

1073
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,020
While he does a lot of primate work too,
it does a lot of work with baboons and 

1074
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,291
stuff too,
but he's the foremost expert in the 

1075
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,520
United States of toxoplasmosis and the 
effects of it.

1076
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,090
It gets,
it gets them horny for cat urine.

1077
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,570
It literally changes the.
The sexual hard wiring of a rat gets it 

1078
00:45:45,361 --> 00:45:48,810
horny for cat urine.
They literally get erections and they go

1079
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:51,180
running around near Cath.
They're not scared of cats,

1080
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,550
takes away their fear.
The cats eat them,

1081
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:58,730
and because of that it gets into people.
The cats around it doesn't seem to 

1082
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,181
effect the cat's behavior.
The cats are just carriers and then it 

1083
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:03,870
gets into people,
makes people more aggressive.

1084
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:06,050
It makes people more prone to get in 
accidents.

1085
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,610
Disproportionate amount of motorcycle 
victims,

1086
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,220
motorcycle crash victims have 
toxoplasmosis thing.

1087
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,860
That's what's the polsky pointed out 
when he was doing his residency,

1088
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:19,130
they did some.
He was doing some work in emergency 

1089
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:21,381
rooms and one of the surgeons was saying
there's a disproportionate amount of 

1090
00:46:21,381 --> 00:46:25,791
motorcycle victims that have Toxoplasma,
so when a motorcycle victim would come 

1091
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,601
in,
they would test them for toxo 

1092
00:46:29,601 --> 00:46:31,550
interestingly talks,
I was one of the few diseases you can 

1093
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:31,590
pick up from deer.

1094
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,140
Really.
How do you get it from deere?

1095
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,730
Uh,
I'm not entirely sure.

1096
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,730
I think it's contact or eating 
undercooked venison,

1097
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,940
but it's very rare.
It's actually,

1098
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:46,970
I think there's only been like six cases
in the last 20 years that the CDC 

1099
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,410
reports.
But ironically there's a guy who,

1100
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,630
who,
um,

1101
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,510
is on the facebook forum that I run was 
one of the sex.

1102
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:55,420
Oh,
what?

1103
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,430
What are the odds?
Right.

1104
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,450
And he's like,
well,

1105
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:59,460
you know,
I'm one of these guys.

1106
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:00,110
And it was,
it,

1107
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:05,170
it messed him up pretty bad.
In what way would you say they're doing 

1108
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:05,940
a lot of the same?
A lot of the same symptoms that you were

1109
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:07,100
talking about,
you know,

1110
00:47:07,101 --> 00:47:08,570
risk taking risk,
taking it,

1111
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:11,490
any aggressive behavior,
blood problems too.

1112
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:13,830
Like I can't,
I can't remember for the life of me,

1113
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:14,370
but it was,
you know,

1114
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,820
like his blood pressure spiked and it 
was,

1115
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,700
it was significant.

1116
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,900
Well,
it's what people,

1117
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:23,901
when they talk about crazy cat people,
that literally is what they're talking 

1118
00:47:23,901 --> 00:47:23,901
about probably.
Yeah.

1119
00:47:23,901 --> 00:47:26,490
Oh,
the 60 percent of France at one point in

1120
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:29,800
time had toxoplasma because of all the 
roaming around.

1121
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:32,260
They think they've gotten it down to as 
low as like 35 percent.

1122
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:33,790
Uh,
same as Brazil.

1123
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:38,791
Brazil is somewhere around 40 percent,
40 percent plus of people that live 

1124
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:43,111
there have toxo.
There's also a disproportionate 

1125
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:46,021
connection between toxoplasmosis rates 
of infection in infestation of infection

1126
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,980
and successful soccer teams.
They're risk takers.

1127
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:51,450
Yeah.
Well,

1128
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,650
yeah.
Risk takers more aggressive.

1129
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,280
It's very strange if you tested them and
maybe they also know,

1130
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:58,030
again,
it would be off the chain,

1131
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,440
your real problem,
but I'm fucking cat crazy,

1132
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:07,441
bro.
I think there's also some sort of a 

1133
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:09,480
connection between sexual promiscuity 
and females.

1134
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,300
Hmm.
Yeah.

1135
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:15,301
There's a lot of weird stuff they're 
working on to try to figure out what 

1136
00:48:15,301 --> 00:48:15,910
exactly these fucking Paris it's doing 
to people's brains.

1137
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,930
Well,
you've heard of the courthouse steps,

1138
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:17,800
right?
Yes.

1139
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,200
Yeah.
Make the Zombie ants.

1140
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:20,980
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1141
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:21,640
Well,
there's good.

1142
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:25,270
There's good strains of quarter step 
stool to climb to the top of that leaf.

1143
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:25,670
Well,
the.

1144
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:31,180
This is what people don't know.
What you're trying to talk about is 

1145
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,230
there's a mushroom that infects the 
spores.

1146
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:37,231
In fact,
an ant convinced the ant to go some 

1147
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:41,671
linear high so that these cordyceps 
mushrooms grow inside the antibody body 

1148
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:44,710
and then it explodes and sprays spores 
through the air,

1149
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,720
infecting all around.
It's so gnarly nature.

1150
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:53,020
So not like if you watched the movie 
like the movie alien.

1151
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,390
So I don't know if this is 100 percent 
true,

1152
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,970
but I've always heard that that the 
creature is a.

1153
00:48:57,971 --> 00:49:01,640
is a Mashup of real insects.
Is that the.

1154
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,010
The bug.
Okay,

1155
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,600
so this is this a dead one that has it 
already as a timelapse.

1156
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:11,800
So in the time lapse,
this mushroom is growing out of the back

1157
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:16,801
of his aunt's head like this aunt has 
been killed by this fungus and it's now 

1158
00:49:16,801 --> 00:49:21,751
manifesting itself in this growing form.
That's not really a plant.

1159
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,930
That's another thing that people 
misconstrue about fungus.

1160
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,620
It's actually closer to an animal than 
it is to vegetation.

1161
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:32,980
They they breathe oxygen and breathe out
carbon dioxide.

1162
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,370
So this is some fucking freaky ass alien
life form.

1163
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,620
It was growing out.
His aunts had look at the size of that 

1164
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,040
thing.
It's huge.

1165
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:47,050
It's so gnarly.
Kills the ant and it grows mushrooms out

1166
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,270
of it and then the spores blow up and.
Oh,

1167
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,240
well that's cool.
That's so bizarre.

1168
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,560
Look,
it's popping through its exoskeleton.

1169
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,710
That's so creepy.
Like,

1170
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,330
you know where Ridley Scott got it.
Oh yeah.

1171
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,750
Well do you know about that aquatic worm
that infects grasshoppers?

1172
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,550
No.
Oh,

1173
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,320
this is a great one.
This aquatic worms.

1174
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,450
I love how focused and direct our 
conversation today.

1175
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:12,850
So every one of them I do as a director 
of my life,

1176
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:17,470
but um,
these aquatic worms.

1177
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,880
Uh,
or a.

1178
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,310
What is it?
Chronic.

1179
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,240
Yeah,
it's aquatic warm,

1180
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,740
right?
Yeah.

1181
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:28,930
Um,
it gets inside of grasshopper and this 

1182
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,711
is one infected a.
I'm a praying mantis and this one's 

1183
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:32,660
going to burst out of the praying 
Mantis,

1184
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:35,800
but when this aquatic worm gets,
oh,

1185
00:50:35,801 --> 00:50:37,440
because you get it wet,
that's what it'll.

1186
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:42,730
It'll come out and.
But the aquatic worm that gets inside 

1187
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,810
grasshoppers,
when it reaches gestation,

1188
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,400
when it reaches its,
uh,

1189
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,140
it's,
it's when it's time to be born,

1190
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,530
it rewires the grasshoppers brain and 
talks the grasshopper into committing 

1191
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:57,350
suicide.
So the grasshopper jumps into a lake and

1192
00:50:57,351 --> 00:51:01,520
drowns and the aquatic worm comes out of
its body and swims away.

1193
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,410
Like,
look at this thing that's so nasty.

1194
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:08,490
Look at the size of this fucking thing 
that was living inside this praying 

1195
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:12,131
mantis while it was alive.
So it takes over the mind of these,

1196
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,740
these beings.
I mean,

1197
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,760
look at this size of this thing.
I mean,

1198
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:22,060
it is a solid 30 to 40 percent,
maybe more of the mass of the body of 

1199
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:25,200
this.
It's so gnarly.

1200
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,170
It's hard to believe when you look at 
the size of this thing,

1201
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,570
because it's continuing to come out the 
grasshopper.

1202
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,400
Let's just.
If we had a scale,

1203
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,320
the grasshoppers maybe two inches long 
mantis.

1204
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,010
That's the man that meant this is 
probably a solid four inches long.

1205
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

1206
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,550
Mantis.
So whatever length that is,

1207
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,710
the aquatic worms three times that.
Yeah.

1208
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:49,090
Which is just nuts and it's living in 
its body and still coming out as we're 

1209
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:49,090
talking about auto.

1210
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:53,660
It's a fucking huge man and he's trying 
to find water that's gravitating towards

1211
00:51:53,661 --> 00:51:56,420
the water,
but with grass hopping on fire.

1212
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,020
I know,
right?

1213
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,780
That's evil.
We're lucky too little if,

1214
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:01,980
uh,
if you find the grasshopper,

1215
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,890
there's one where it talks the 
grasshopper,

1216
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:09,130
the grasshopper just jumps in,
the water just starts drowning and then 

1217
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:09,590
it pops out of its body and it's like 
nature.

1218
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,870
Such a creepy,
creepy thing.

1219
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,770
And in a lot of ways,
like the parasite world in particular,

1220
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,060
like somehow or another predators to me 
are less disturbing than parasites.

1221
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,990
Oh yeah.
Here's one that's coming out of it was a

1222
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,120
cricket or something.
Could be.

1223
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,240
Look at that creepy thing.
Yeah,

1224
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:31,540
I'm aquatic worms.
Yeah,

1225
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,230
not good.
Let's,

1226
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:38,231
uh,
I want to talk to you about more 

1227
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:38,570
bizarrely edible of things that may be,
um,

1228
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,670
a lot of people don't think of sturgeon 
is one of them.

1229
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,550
I didn't know.
I knew that people eat sturgeon eggs,

1230
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:46,520
but I really wasn't aware that the 
sturgeon was that delicious fish.

1231
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:48,800
I also wasn't aware that it was illegal 
to catch them.

1232
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,290
Like I for some reason thought that they
were in danger.

1233
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,390
It's weird.
Which is one of the reasons why poaching

1234
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:58,391
is such a big issue is because we're one
of the last recreational fisheries in 

1235
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,800
the country for sturgeon.
Really?

1236
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,440
Yeah.
Because the populations.

1237
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,920
Yeah.
Because the um,

1238
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:08,921
the east coast,
east coast sturgeon was fished out 

1239
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:11,800
around 100 years ago and they're only 
now coming back in the east coast.

1240
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,840
There's still no fishery for them.
So all of the sturgeon you've seen 

1241
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,020
restaurants in Sacramento is farmed.
Oh,

1242
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:23,110
that's interesting.
So how do they farm a sturgeon slowly,

1243
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,560
I would imagine.
I think they have to be seven years 

1244
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:29,850
before they can take it to market size.

1245
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,830
So it's like making bourbon.
Yeah,

1246
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:36,831
because I was reading like a,
what was another commercial fish they 

1247
00:53:36,831 --> 00:53:41,121
were talking about the amount of time 
that it takes to grow a commercial fish 

1248
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:42,720
to the point where you can harvest it 
and it was some insane number,

1249
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:47,721
like two inches a year where it takes 
forever to grow these things to the 

1250
00:53:47,721 --> 00:53:48,120
point,
I think it was catfish.

1251
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,940
They were talking about like large 
catfish.

1252
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:54,950
That's what it was.
They were talking about what's going on 

1253
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:55,650
in the Ohio river that um,
they're,

1254
00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:00,060
they're putting these catfish in lakes 
and they're taking them out of rivers,

1255
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:02,730
are putting large cat fish in lakes,
but they can't survive,

1256
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,680
can only live in these lakes for so 
long,

1257
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:06,870
but everybody wants to catch a big 
catfish.

1258
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:12,230
So they have these commercial cat 
fishing businesses were recreational 

1259
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,060
catfishing with take these people and 
they'll have them fishing in these lakes

1260
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:20,420
and they used some sort of chemical in 
the lake that forces the cat fish to 

1261
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:21,960
bite.

1262
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:23,740
Yeah.
And this,

1263
00:54:23,741 --> 00:54:26,760
this chemical fish bordello yeah,
it's really gross man,

1264
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,360
because it causes these legions on the 
catfishes skin.

1265
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,710
So these people catch these catfishes 
and they have catfish rather sorry,

1266
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:40,010
and they have these red sores all over 
their body because some chemicals have 

1267
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:44,621
been introduced into the water,
which I guess the irritant causes them 

1268
00:54:44,621 --> 00:54:46,050
to like they're biting out of 
frustration.

1269
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:49,260
I guess maybe the unspeakable in pursuit
of the inevitable.

1270
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,700
What's is so bizarre.
Like what a strange choice that people 

1271
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,740
have decided.
Let's take this animal out there.

1272
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,720
There's one with legions on it.
Oh yeah,

1273
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,510
yeah.
We'll see.

1274
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:03,720
Another issue rises on bigger catfishes 
are introduced into pay lakes.

1275
00:55:03,721 --> 00:55:05,170
Yeah.
So legs.

1276
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:06,670
Yeah.
They have these lakes.

1277
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,240
So I didn't even know that.
I didn't even know there was a paleo.

1278
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,330
Like look at the all the spots on that 
one.

1279
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:17,390
Look at the fucking spots on that day 
and see you find what it says.

1280
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,530
That chemical is that they dumped into 
the water.

1281
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:22,400
Just go to the river in Virginia.
You'll kitchen ice one.

1282
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:26,820
I've caught 70 pounders.
Well in a river.

1283
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:28,170
Really?
Yeah.

1284
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:29,460
I mean how many of them are out?
Which,

1285
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:32,640
which fish you catch blue fish.
A white cat.

1286
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:35,400
A white cat because it's a big one.
Why cats bluecat's channel cats,

1287
00:55:35,401 --> 00:55:37,110
but yeah,
blues and whites are usually biggest.

1288
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,750
Atlanta heads get really big too,
but they don't live in Virginia.

1289
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:43,050
I don't think it's called juicing.
Okay.

1290
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:46,650
The chemicals they put in the water make
the fish bite in the pe lake industry.

1291
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:51,651
It's called juicing weird.
Look at the fucking lesions on that 

1292
00:55:51,651 --> 00:55:51,900
thing.
Scroll up a little Jimmy backup.

1293
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,480
Look at that.
The poor things body.

1294
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,150
It's just wrong.
It's bizarre.

1295
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,040
It's not just wrong.
It's bizarre.

1296
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:04,110
I don't really understand how that ever 
got past how people are like accepting 

1297
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:04,110
that.

1298
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,230
Like that's a natural one.
The one below that.

1299
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,240
This seems totally healthy that some got
caught from a river.

1300
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,950
So these pay lakes is a is like,
I guess it's like a private land thing.

1301
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:18,951
Somebody owns them and it just keeps 
dumping these fish in there and 

1302
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:18,951
apparently they don't live there very 
long.

1303
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,890
They don't else fishing equivalent of a,
of a.

1304
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:24,400
those little teeny high fence places you
see in the east.

1305
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,100
You go hot,
go hunt elk on 40 acres.

1306
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,160
Do they have those in the east coast?
Like so,

1307
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,520
you know,
in Texas a lot of the high fence places 

1308
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,240
are thousands and thousands of acres,
but they have them in the,

1309
00:56:36,241 --> 00:56:40,210
in the Midwest and the east,
and sometimes they're painfully small,

1310
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,500
you know,
like tens of acres where effectively,

1311
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,350
you know,
you're shooting something in a pen.

1312
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,220
I saw one that was 10 acres,
right?

1313
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,080
It's on Ebay.

1314
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,990
Yeah.
There were craigslist where this guy had

1315
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:57,991
put up this hunt in quotes.
I'm doing air quotes for this enormous 

1316
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:02,860
buck that they had used for breeding on 
this commercial,

1317
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:07,190
dear property.
See if you own a piece of land and pro,

1318
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:12,290
uh,
in Texas or in any place where they 

1319
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:15,001
allow this,
you can buy deer and then have these 

1320
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:17,620
deer released onto your land and then 
you can air quotes again,

1321
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:22,770
hunt them.
So they raised these things to maturity 

1322
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,210
and they give them this massive protein 
rich diet.

1323
00:57:25,211 --> 00:57:27,610
And then they also have great genetics 
on top of that.

1324
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:31,750
So these deer have these insane antlers.
Franken buck of all.

1325
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:36,751
They're so strange looking.
It's such a weird thing when you see 

1326
00:57:36,751 --> 00:57:39,901
them and you know,
that is what a regular wild Colorado 

1327
00:57:39,901 --> 00:57:42,010
mule deer it looks like.
It just looks normal.

1328
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:43,930
It's like that's what you see.

1329
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,930
Everybody recognizes it.
That's what it looks like when you see 

1330
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,220
one of those bizarre farm raised box.
It looks like they have bushes grown out

1331
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:51,850
of.
It does.

1332
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,910
It's really bizarre.
I don't even think it's attractive.

1333
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:56,200
It's gross.
It doesn't,

1334
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,040
it doesn't have that,
you know,

1335
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,030
that classic line of a,
of a regular,

1336
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,980
of a deer that is kind of,
I think is imprinted on our brains.

1337
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:03,730
Yeah.
No,

1338
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:04,570
I agree.
It's,

1339
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,410
it's,
it's some weird thing like double e fake

1340
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:10,210
boobs.
Right?

1341
00:58:10,211 --> 00:58:10,660
Like,
okay,

1342
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:11,920
what are you doing?
Like you went,

1343
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,480
you went crazy.
He went too far.

1344
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,030
Like it is something that doesn't make 
any sense anymore.

1345
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,910
Yeah.
Um,

1346
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,040
another fish that I wanted to ask you 
about is what are you going?

1347
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,690
What's up?
I found out what?

1348
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,950
The juicing.
Okay.

1349
00:58:23,951 --> 00:58:26,550
What's the Chemical Hopper Selfie?
Oh.

1350
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,100
So it says that it forces them to feed 
and move excessively.

1351
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,730
And then it also is used to like treat 
vegetation.

1352
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:38,731
And algae and other lakes kill an excess
that can kill fish too.

1353
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,240
But it says it's designed to kill 
unwanted lake vegetation.

1354
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,080
Copper sulfate.
And it also used to be put in canned 

1355
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,980
green beans to keep them green.
Oh my God.

1356
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,590
I wonder if it made people move around a
lot after the eight.

1357
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,550
Fucking strange man.
God,

1358
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:05,551
what kind of monster pours out into a 
lake to get the fish to eat more?

1359
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,200
Um,
I want to talk to you about Gar.

1360
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:11,140
Have you ever had garfish?
I actually haven't.

1361
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,370
I know guys who have,
um,

1362
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,550
I know you have to pretty much clean it 
with a hatchet.

1363
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:20,950
And I know that everybody I know who's 
eating Gar says is awesome.

1364
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,250
Yeah,
I've heard smoked.

1365
00:59:22,251 --> 00:59:23,690
Gar is awesome.
Jamie.

1366
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:25,670
That's a little tiny one pull up.
But yeah,

1367
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,390
look,
there you go.

1368
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:28,670
Yeah.
That is a crazy fish.

1369
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:30,940
Has been around for what,
how many millions of years of thing,

1370
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,460
but a lot for like over a hundred.
I totally primitive.

1371
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:37,880
I mean it literally looks like some kind
of a fucking dinosaur fish.

1372
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:40,790
And those are in Texas.
Natural Texas.

1373
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:42,260
Oklahoma,
Arkansas.

1374
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,330
Yeah.
Like Louisiana.

1375
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:47,690
And can you catch those on a hooker?
Do you spear them or you can get them on

1376
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:47,990
a hook?

1377
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:49,100
What do they.
What do they have?

1378
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:50,120
Wire?
Yeah,

1379
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:51,340
you'd better have a lot of wire,
right?

1380
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:53,180
Like those teeth,
if I remember right.

1381
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:54,890
They like live bait.
Okay.

1382
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,700
What an enormous fucking crazy,
weird animal.

1383
00:59:59,380 --> 00:59:59,990
There's a big.
Okay.

1384
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:01,550
That's a perspective shot.
That's still.

1385
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,300
That's probably an eight foot car.
What's a world record guard?

1386
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,980
Let's tell you.
Guess I'm going to say gets to 12 feet.

1387
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,350
Twelve feet.
That's going can be my guess.

1388
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,700
Wow.
I'm going to go with 10.

1389
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,660
You're probably right though.
New World record that says quick.

1390
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,200
Twelve feet.
Let's find it on the web.

1391
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,670
What is the world record?
Two hundred 79 pounds.

1392
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:24,890
Wow.
How big is that?

1393
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,050
How long is it?
200.

1394
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:30,110
Seventy nine pounds caught in 1951.
That's the world record.

1395
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,820
Yeah.
Whoa.

1396
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,890
That's not from 1951.
And we'll get the size of that thing.

1397
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,920
Oh,
alligator gar.

1398
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,390
Now is there a difference between an 
alligator Gar and a regular garden?

1399
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:45,420
Yeah,
I think there's a couple of different 

1400
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:45,420
species.
Oh,

1401
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:45,420
and you can eat them all.
Uh,

1402
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:45,880
as far as I know.
So yeah,

1403
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:50,881
that's another animal I didn't know that
you can eat these fish until I watched 

1404
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,801
one of those,
a crazy reality shows where people live 

1405
01:00:53,801 --> 01:00:57,341
in the mountains in other one of those 
subsistence shows bleed and we made 

1406
01:00:58,161 --> 01:01:01,860
people animal.
Dick's never made people igar.

1407
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,630
It's an literally as an armor plate on 
the outside of it.

1408
01:01:05,631 --> 01:01:07,010
Right.
It's like you need like a hatchet to get

1409
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:07,510
through it.
Yeah.

1410
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,030
I've seen people cutting through them 
with what looks like a salsa holds.

1411
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:16,330
No,
it was what they were using was like 

1412
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:16,330
something you would trim branches off 
loppers.

1413
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:22,210
Just try to cut through that stuff.
40 seven inches and girth eight foot 

1414
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:25,190
five.
Oh my God.

1415
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:26,810
That's a giant thing.
So,

1416
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:28,320
but that's not a world record,
right?

1417
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,330
That's just a giant one.
Hmm.

1418
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,090
Ooh,
what a weird animal.

1419
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:37,630
It's just strange to me also that some 
animals figured out how to stay alive 

1420
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,010
like alligators and crocodiles for,
you know,

1421
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,090
x amount of million years.
Well,

1422
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:46,240
all these other things like large mouth 
bass are like so much more recent and 

1423
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,920
these things swim amongst them.
You strange remnants of a much more 

1424
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,380
savage past like the coelacanth.
Yes.

1425
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:57,710
That's a great one because that one they
thought until they caught one,

1426
01:01:57,711 --> 01:02:02,711
it was like the early 19 hundreds.
They thought it'd been extinct for 

1427
01:02:02,711 --> 01:02:02,711
billions of years.
South Africa.

1428
01:02:02,711 --> 01:02:07,520
Yeah.
Now apparently like you can catch them 

1429
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:07,520
like there's,
you know,

1430
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,660
there's a place where you can catch 
them.

1431
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:10,250
It's,
it's legal.

1432
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,370
Well I think it's catch and release,
but it's uh,

1433
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:13,910
but it's,
it's not that,

1434
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,010
you know,
that was up coelacanth,

1435
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,750
but when you catch them,
super common,

1436
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:20,220
but it's not like a news event when the 
catch one anymore.

1437
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,210
Oh,
there's one right there.

1438
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,240
Wow.
What a strange looking prehistoric 

1439
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:26,240
creature to actually.
I think honestly,

1440
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,870
I think the gars more impressive.
That's bizarre looking.

1441
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:31,410
But the um,
the coelacanth if it's,

1442
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:32,860
is it a deep water fish?
Yeah.

1443
01:02:32,861 --> 01:02:37,861
It's a deep water section.
Now when you catch and release at deep 

1444
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:37,861
water fish,
aren't they fuck though?

1445
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:39,630
Bringing them up through the top,
like rockfish hard in the Pacific.

1446
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:44,631
They certainly are.
They don't have the eyeballs pop out of 

1447
01:02:44,631 --> 01:02:44,631
their head.
That was weird.

1448
01:02:44,631 --> 01:02:45,330
But link cod don't.
Oh,

1449
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,160
so if you catch a lean cod,
you can bring them up to the surface and

1450
01:02:48,161 --> 01:02:50,130
there is that a coelacanth and someone 
caught on a hook to you.

1451
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,430
It looks like it.
And so when you catch a link caught on a

1452
01:02:53,431 --> 01:02:58,431
hook,
you can just throw it back in the water 

1453
01:02:58,431 --> 01:02:59,330
and even though it goes 500 feet,
never seen her link card with Ben's real

1454
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,420
rockfish.

1455
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:05,420
Always got them.
So it's just a matter of the frailty of 

1456
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:05,420
the,
uh,

1457
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,380
it's just the way the fish has built,
I think,

1458
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,150
you know,
and here I'm just guessing,

1459
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,950
but um,
but link,

1460
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:15,980
God will come from the,
from the bottom all the way up to the 

1461
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,171
top to hunt as a beautiful fish too.
Whereas bucket mouth,

1462
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,520
God was cool looking fresh and delicious
too.

1463
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,200
Big Old bucket.
Now that link,

1464
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:30,210
odds are,
that's another one that looks like it's 

1465
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:30,360
not supposed to be alive anymore.
They're so awesome.

1466
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,320
They're so awesome.
Lead biggest one I ever caught was a,

1467
01:03:33,321 --> 01:03:38,321
was a hitchhiker.
It had hit a rock fish brought the 

1468
01:03:38,321 --> 01:03:39,450
rockfish,
just the surface and the link.

1469
01:03:39,451 --> 01:03:41,140
I wouldn't let go.
No Shit.

1470
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,560
Gaff.
The linkcard wow.

1471
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,390
That's interesting.
Twenty three pounds.

1472
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,670
Well he wouldn't let go.
Nope.

1473
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,660
Why does that go?
If you,

1474
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:51,570
if you let a 10 break the water,
but if you keep it's head in the water,

1475
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:53,100
it won't like that.
Oh.

1476
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:54,570
So when head comes out of the water,
it's like,

1477
01:03:54,571 --> 01:03:55,470
oh,
this is bullshit.

1478
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:55,990
Right?
He's like,

1479
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,760
oh,
that's peculiar.

1480
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,290
Look at the mouth of those fuckers blew 
one.

1481
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,850
Wow.
So do you like it?

1482
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,940
Like that to be the last thing you saw?
Yeah,

1483
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:10,970
that would suck.
It would be like tripping and hell 

1484
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:11,340
sucked into that vortex.
Yeah.

1485
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:12,540
That looks like something from that 
movie.

1486
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:17,541
The event horizon,
when the demons taking over the 

1487
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:17,541
spaceship like sucked into that.
Yeah.

1488
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,720
The teeth on that fucker.
This is a hard ass world.

1489
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:24,420
That thing lives in done.
Don't let them when you catch him.

1490
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,290
Oh yeah.
Right.

1491
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

1492
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:31,881
You gotta grab that thing around the 
gills or gaffers and what is all that 

1493
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:31,881
we're looking at here?
Uh,

1494
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:34,560
he's gutting.
It was strange stomach looking.

1495
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,120
Yeah,
they turn blue like that.

1496
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,570
It's,
Oh,

1497
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:44,350
I used to know they turn blue because of
what they eat and I think it's like 

1498
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:48,950
salmon when you buy commercial salmon 
and they have to die the skin because 

1499
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:48,950
they're not eating the same kind of 
bugs.

1500
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:50,550
Yeah.
Well farmed farmed Atlantic Salmon.

1501
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,450
Yeah.
Um,

1502
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,210
well they're eating.
The red is from Krill.

1503
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,870
Excuse me.
Blue caught.

1504
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:58,140
Okay.
So this is hilarious.

1505
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:00,120
So I've seen this article extremely 
rare,

1506
01:05:00,121 --> 01:05:03,930
blue cod cod in Australia,
which is a.

1507
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:08,970
okay.
So it was explained to me that they are 

1508
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:08,970
extremely rare in Alaska.
Is that say Alaska Australia?

1509
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:09,930
Scroll up.
Alaska,

1510
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:15,470
Alaska,
but they're incredibly common where I 

1511
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:15,510
live.
Oh.

1512
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,360
I once I once hooked into 13 lingcod

1513
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,430
and one fishing trip and six of them 
were blue.

1514
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,170
Whoa.
So,

1515
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:28,190
and this is all off the northern 
California closes off the Marin Sonoma 

1516
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,290
coast and that's a great area to fish,
right?

1517
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:32,440
It is,
but it's like not extremely rare.

1518
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:34,690
Apparently up.
They're there if they're rare,

1519
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,790
but it has to do with their diet.
Okay.

1520
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:40,630
So maybe that it migrate from up there 
all the way up to Alaska native,

1521
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:45,690
their native all the way up to Alaska.
So that the really biggest ones or if 

1522
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:46,000
you catch them in the Alaska.
Oh really?

1523
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,980
50 pounders.
Yeah,

1524
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,850
the ones that would eat a toddler.
Well,

1525
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:54,250
Alaska has those Goddamn halibut that 
are like our doors giant.

1526
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:59,790
So I was sort of sad because I went up 
there because I wanted to catch a giant 

1527
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:02,530
and then I was reading about it before 
and I realize that every,

1528
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:06,070
every halibut over about 125 pounds is 
big breeding female.

1529
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:10,640
So it's a bad idea to land it because 
actually the halibut stocks and Alaska's

1530
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:14,830
are not doing that well.
So get to the surface,

1531
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:17,800
get a picture of it.
So your ideal halibut,

1532
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:19,990
apparently it's like an 80 pounder or 85
pounder.

1533
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:25,080
That's plenty big,
which is plenty big and it's not 

1534
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,631
necessarily big breeding female.
And so you're not really going to hurt 

1535
01:06:27,631 --> 01:06:27,631
the species is like,
like,

1536
01:06:27,631 --> 01:06:29,950
like the guys who keep the 400 pounders.
Absolutely.

1537
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:34,300
And the weird thing about fish breeding 
behavior is that it's,

1538
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:37,810
it's exponential.
So a buddy of mine,

1539
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,170
a guy named Jay Waldron,
uh,

1540
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,050
he landed 53 pounds,
striper in the delta.

1541
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,150
Um,
actually it was a,

1542
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:51,270
it was a fishing buddy and they tried 
and tried and tried and tried to revive 

1543
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:51,270
it,
but it just,

1544
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:52,060
it died,
which sucked.

1545
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,530
Um,
and,

1546
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:59,700
and then,
but it was that thing there would be 

1547
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,670
like the supermom for thousands and 
thousands and thousands of stripers 

1548
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:07,480
Morales.
An 18 inch striper that was a female 

1549
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,130
would not be.
It's not linear.

1550
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,690
It's not like they get a little bit 
more,

1551
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,910
they get exponentially better,
more,

1552
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:13,790
you know,
they get,

1553
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:18,810
did have exponentially more breeding 
power as they get bigger and bigger and 

1554
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:19,900
bigger.
So it's generally not a good idea to,

1555
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,030
to eat our seed corn even if they're 
fish.

1556
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,820
Wow.
Um,

1557
01:07:23,821 --> 01:07:26,790
I had a friend of mine of cotton,
enormous halibut on a boat.

1558
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,680
It was one of those,
a charter boats,

1559
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,560
fishing boats and calmer when they were 
pulling it up.

1560
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:34,530
They cut the line on him and he was so 
pissed off.

1561
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:36,360
He's like,
they were trying to tell them like,

1562
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,470
look,
you can't keep this one.

1563
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,170
It was huge.
It was like I go how big,

1564
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,420
and he's like more than 300 pounds we 
have.

1565
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,510
I don't even know how big it took 
forever to bring in,

1566
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,550
but once we got it to the surface,
they wanted to cut the line.

1567
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:52,610
They let it go and he was so pissed off.
He just the right thing to do 

1568
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:52,610
biologically.
It makes sense.

1569
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:57,260
It totally makes sense and is such a 
cool looking animal to like what a bus 

1570
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:57,260
train.

1571
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,560
Glad that fucker.
Yeah,

1572
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,070
that one's too big.
Two hundred 55 pounds.

1573
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:03,870
They fucked up.
They shouldn't have killed that one.

1574
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:04,800
Right?
I wouldn't know.

1575
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:05,730
I mean it's,
it's legal.

1576
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:10,731
It's not illegal,
but it's supposed to do it because the 

1577
01:08:10,731 --> 01:08:10,731
stocks are.
They're okay,

1578
01:08:10,731 --> 01:08:15,531
but they're not doing super great 
because the chances are the in the next 

1579
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,280
dropdown

1580
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,140
you're going to get to 75 pounder 
anyway.

1581
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,020
Right?
So really there's Jesus.

1582
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:24,860
You see the ones in the right.
That's what you should be keeping.

1583
01:08:24,861 --> 01:08:27,550
The two 87.
I'd let that go because think about it.

1584
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,540
How much hell,
but are you going to eat really?

1585
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,290
Right?
I mean,

1586
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:35,291
yeah,
I know most guys are gonna go up to 

1587
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:35,291
Alaska once a year,
so.

1588
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:35,840
But still those other ones are in the 
seventies.

1589
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:39,740
It was easily three or four of those in 
the 70 pound range.

1590
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:44,660
Two hundred and 87 pound fish is a big 
ass fucking Fishman.

1591
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,040
And the,
the flake,

1592
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:49,630
the flake on those big halibut is so big
that it's,

1593
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,100
it gets so coarse that they're not.
They're okay.

1594
01:08:52,101 --> 01:08:53,290
I mean they taste fine,
but the,

1595
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:58,130
they're harder to cook.
When my oldest daughter was,

1596
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,940
I guess she was like 12,
somewhere around there,

1597
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,840
12 or 13,
she,

1598
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,020
she's real sensitive.

1599
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:07,910
She's very sweet person and she wanted 
to be a vegetarian and uh,

1600
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,600
you know,
and she was a vegetarian for a while.

1601
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:13,850
Then she started eating meat again,
but she always loves animals and I said,

1602
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:16,070
well listen,
let's go fishing.

1603
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:18,110
And this is before I ever hunted.
I'm like,

1604
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:20,660
let's go fishing.
We'll catch a fish and we'll cook it.

1605
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:25,661
And it's a kind of a cool experience 
because you get to experience catching 

1606
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:25,661
something,
cooking it.

1607
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,920
So we went out on his boat five minutes 
into the trip.

1608
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:29,980
We catch a fucking Marlin.
All right.

1609
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,790
And Are you fishing Hawaii?
Oh,

1610
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:35,650
we're in Hawaii and five minutes in we,
we,

1611
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:38,140
it's not a big Marlin.
It's about a 70 pound Marlin.

1612
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,480
Um,
it takes a while to get an onboard.

1613
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:45,290
We get on board and then the guys who 
run the boat beat this thing to death in

1614
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:47,600
front of her with a club because that's 
what you do.

1615
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,480
You get a Marlin on board,
you beat it to death.

1616
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:55,510
Why?
That's the only way to stop it from 

1617
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:55,650
flopping around.
And why would they kill it needed?

1618
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,750
Oh,
they eat them.

1619
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:57,350
Okay.
Yeah,

1620
01:09:57,351 --> 01:09:58,700
they smoke them apparently.
Okay.

1621
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,280
But that was another thing I thought 
Marlin's aren't good.

1622
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:04,790
I'm glad you just said that because the 
most recent trip that I had,

1623
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:09,791
I was in Hawaii just a month ago and 
that's the only state I've never been 

1624
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:09,791
to.
Oh my God,

1625
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:11,630
you got to go.
That's a magic place.

1626
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:16,960
That's a real.
I think Hawaii has an energy that when 

1627
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:17,330
you get off the plane,
he goes,

1628
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,020
oh,
we're here.

1629
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,690
Like it's got a feel to it because 
you're on a fucking volcano.

1630
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:23,600
A volcano in the middle of the ocean.
I mean,

1631
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:24,610
that's really what it is.
Sure.

1632
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,050
Volcano popped at me.
You could.

1633
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:31,180
You could.
We took a helicopter where you fly over 

1634
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:33,791
the volcano as it leaks into the ocean.
You see the steam coming up as the lava 

1635
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:34,580
is flowing.
It's amazing.

1636
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,060
Anyway,
they pulled me.

1637
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:41,300
She's such a sweet kid.
She's so sensitive and friendly and nice

1638
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,600
and they beat this fucking and Marlin to
death in front of her and then they're 

1639
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,101
covering it with bags of ice and they're
all psyched and it's making all these 

1640
01:10:51,101 --> 01:10:54,881
weird noises and then like,
she just starts to calm down and get 

1641
01:10:54,881 --> 01:10:56,210
over it and then 20 minutes later start 
flopping again.

1642
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:57,260
It's not totally dead.

1643
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,000
I've never been able to take her fishing
since she's 20 now.

1644
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,200
She's like,
fuck you,

1645
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,630
fuck you dad.
What did you do?

1646
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:09,860
And I'm like,
honey,

1647
01:11:09,861 --> 01:11:12,200
this is where we get fished.
This were from,

1648
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,090
it was the size of a dog.
It was like,

1649
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:16,440
you know,
a dog size thing.

1650
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:18,840
It was,
it wasn't like we brought in,

1651
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,150
you know,
a 12 inch trout.

1652
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:26,210
Right.
It was a giant ass living creature that 

1653
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:26,860
these guys beat to death.
I mean,

1654
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,130
it's a small boat.
They,

1655
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,390
they beat it to death five feet from 
her,

1656
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,450
so five feet away they're beaten this 
thing with club.

1657
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,160
Wow.
Yeah.

1658
01:11:35,161 --> 01:11:37,080
And I just kind of dramatic.
It was very dramatic.

1659
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,150
It was.

1660
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:44,520
So that was the end of that.
We've talked about taking her hunting,

1661
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:50,060
but I don't think,
I think still that fucking one Marlin 

1662
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:50,060
messes with her.
Um,

1663
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,470
but they were telling me that you had to
smoke it.

1664
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,010
But on the last trip that I was on,
which was about a month ago,

1665
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:57,420
these guys were telling me that.
No,

1666
01:11:57,421 --> 01:11:57,660
no,
no.

1667
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:59,490
You can cut it and eat it.
Like swordfish.

1668
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:00,470
Yeah.
He cut it and grill.

1669
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:02,370
No reason why you couldn't.
Have you ever had.

1670
01:12:02,371 --> 01:12:07,371
You've ever had it though?
I've never actually said why were you 

1671
01:12:07,371 --> 01:12:07,920
saying why would you keep Marlin?
Because almost nobody does.

1672
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:12,750
Like you didn't like if you go to Costa 
Rica or Baja or the Caribbean,

1673
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:17,270
they're caught in a catch and release.
Only do that to ensure the population.

1674
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:18,300
I think they do.
I mean,

1675
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:19,020
because I've,
I've,

1676
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:22,230
I've heard that the Hawaiians Cedam but 
I've eaten it and it's just.

1677
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:27,230
But yeah,
I mean almost all Marlin fishing is 

1678
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:27,450
catch and release.
That's interesting.

1679
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:28,860
Yeah.
That's a,

1680
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:31,010
that's the big trophy fish,
right?

1681
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,150
That's the one that they want.
I've never caught one wall.

1682
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:38,640
That was the only time I ever caught one
and then we caught it maybe 10 minutes 

1683
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,380
into fishing.
Swordfish.

1684
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,190
Get that big.
Yeah.

1685
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,500
But that one's coming over the rail.
Yeah.

1686
01:12:43,501 --> 01:12:48,501
That's delicious fish right now.
You think that takes a significantly 

1687
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:49,800
different than a Marlin?
I bet they're pretty similar.

1688
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:54,240
I would like to know why I was wanting 
to ask you about God because I've always

1689
01:12:54,241 --> 01:12:59,241
wanted to go golf fishing because I've 
seen them and when you see those images 

1690
01:12:59,241 --> 01:12:59,470
that we just looked at like,
God damn,

1691
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,080
I want to see that thing in real life.
I would wish to.

1692
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:05,250
You had tried it.
I've tried a lot of things.

1693
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:05,460
Yeah.

1694
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,850
How have you not both in paddlefish is 
an interesting one.

1695
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,740
Right?
That's a Sacramento fish too,

1696
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:12,480
is now.
That's a Missouri River thing.

1697
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:15,300
They're cousins of the sturgeon.
Oh,

1698
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,180
okay.
And that's one that doesn't really have,

1699
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,010
um,
they don't have any bones,

1700
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:20,670
right?
Either.

1701
01:13:20,671 --> 01:13:22,380
Just sturgeon.
Oh really?

1702
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:27,770
Oh.
So sturgeon's law like a shark in that 

1703
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:27,770
sense.
Yeah.

1704
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,520
But start sharks have bones only around 
the jaw right now.

1705
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,560
There's also some weird thing with a 
paddlefish where you pull that spinal 

1706
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,321
cord out of them right now.
What a weird looking fucking thing that 

1707
01:13:39,321 --> 01:13:40,350
is.
They're pretty tasty though.

1708
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,840
That's what I hear.
And uh,

1709
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,280
if you've ever had lump fish caviar,
that's what that is.

1710
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,270
No,
I've never.

1711
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:49,470
What is a lump fish caviar caviar out of
a paddle fish?

1712
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:50,850
I don't know why they call it paddle 
fish,

1713
01:13:50,851 --> 01:13:52,440
but they should just call it paddlefish 
caviar,

1714
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:57,500
which I think they are now.
Something about the restrictions on 

1715
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,620
commercial paddle fishing because I 
don't think there is.

1716
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,020
No,
I think it's all recreational now.

1717
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:03,450
And then some states,
wow,

1718
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,950
that looks like a fake animal.
It doesn't even look real football fish.

1719
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,470
But I think that concern was about the 
caviar.

1720
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:12,490
Right?
So there was again,

1721
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:14,020
um,
there was uh,

1722
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,990
an illegal trade in,
in uh,

1723
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:22,530
and paddlefish caviar.
So there are some states where you can 

1724
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:22,960
keep your fish,
but fish and game keeps the caviar.

1725
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,660
Really.
How bizarre.

1726
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,110
That's not.
I don't think that's pretty good.

1727
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,290
I don't think that's cool.
I think it should be illegal to sell,

1728
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:32,230
but like in Missouri,
Missouri fishing game.

1729
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:34,690
Keep the caviar.
What are they going to do this?

1730
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:35,860
They sell it.
Oh,

1731
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:37,300
that's even weirder.
Yeah,

1732
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,370
that's really weird.
Well,

1733
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,080
I wouldn't,
I mean it probably.

1734
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:42,500
I would,
I would hope I'm,

1735
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,630
you know,
missourians will,

1736
01:14:43,631 --> 01:14:44,620
will,
will tell us,

1737
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:49,890
but I would hope that the proceeds from 
selling the caviar by fish fishing game 

1738
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:50,530
would go back to it.
Like habitat restoration or something.

1739
01:14:50,531 --> 01:14:55,531
I would hope so too.
But I would hope so that you could pay 

1740
01:14:55,531 --> 01:14:56,600
like an additional tag and get to keep 
the caviar.

1741
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,980
I'm saying he caught a female and he pay
an extra $30 or something like that.

1742
01:14:59,981 --> 01:15:04,981
And You keep the caviar.
I know you can't in some states like 

1743
01:15:04,981 --> 01:15:04,981
Montana for sure.
You can.

1744
01:15:04,981 --> 01:15:05,270
In Montana,
like what?

1745
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,740
They have paddlefish in Montana.
Yeah.

1746
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:11,750
They're all a giant rivers,
like name of big giant river in the 

1747
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:11,750
middle of the country and they live 
there.

1748
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,300
That's,
it looks like another one that just made

1749
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:15,220
it through.
It did evolution.

1750
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:16,750
Yeah.
How long has that fucker been?

1751
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:18,070
Around?
One hundred million years.

1752
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:22,180
Easy.
There's a show on tv,

1753
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:25,570
I forget the name of it,
but it's this guy who,

1754
01:15:25,571 --> 01:15:30,571
uh,
who cooks weird stuff on like the 

1755
01:15:30,571 --> 01:15:30,571
sportsmans channel.
Oh,

1756
01:15:30,571 --> 01:15:32,780
that's got les sap dead meat.
Yeah.

1757
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:36,370
Scott.
Scott lives like one to 10 miles from my

1758
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:41,371
house.
That's what I was going to bring him up 

1759
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:41,371
because he's a sacramento.
Yeah.

1760
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:41,620
And he cooked paddlefish.

1761
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:43,200
Yep.
That's what he,

1762
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,940
he like,
he pulled the spinal cord out of him.

1763
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:48,100
He's got an interesting show.
He takes everything.

1764
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:52,450
He has the one of the best self 
deprecating sense of humor ever.

1765
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:53,860
Ever.
Yeah.

1766
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:56,200
That's hilarious.
I mean he's on the dates on the road 300

1767
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:57,400
days a year.
Really?

1768
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,660
Yeah.
He does a lot of stuff for like,

1769
01:15:58,661 --> 01:16:00,910
um,
a group called hunt fish feed.

1770
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:05,830
So it's gets hundreds together to,
to donate tons and tons of game meat for

1771
01:16:05,831 --> 01:16:08,750
homeless shelters.
And they do big like a big cookout thing

1772
01:16:08,751 --> 01:16:10,120
so that everybody gets a meal.
Oh,

1773
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:11,530
that's cool.
That's cool stuff.

1774
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:16,590
Yeah.
But he's found a lot of fish and a lot 

1775
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:19,411
of game that people thought was inedible
actually turns out to be quite 

1776
01:16:19,411 --> 01:16:20,440
delicious.
I'll tell you one that he didn't python.

1777
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,620
Oh really?
Not Good.

1778
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:23,020
He said it was like main landing.

1779
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,520
Mercury.
Whoa.

1780
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,440
He said it was the worst thing he's ever
put in his mouth.

1781
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:27,500
Wow.
Yeah.

1782
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,740
Python.
Python in the everglades.

1783
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:32,290
Huh?
Did he try to do anything with it?

1784
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,270
Marinated?
I think he tried it every which way,

1785
01:16:34,271 --> 01:16:35,400
but Sunday.
And he just like,

1786
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:36,240
no,
none of it here.

1787
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,410
Do you know how do you know when you're 
eating something like that?

1788
01:16:38,411 --> 01:16:41,060
Whether or not it's actually edible?
Well,

1789
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:43,540
I think you can do some,
like allbirds are edible.

1790
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:44,920
For example.
Allbirds.

1791
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,840
Yeah,
some disgusting and fishy.

1792
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:49,870
But uh,
and most mammals are edible,

1793
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:50,800
but like,
you know,

1794
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:53,020
the livers on polar bears have so much 
vitamin A,

1795
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:54,670
it'll kill you if you eat them.
Really?

1796
01:16:54,671 --> 01:16:56,440
Yeah.
So don't need polar bear liver.

1797
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:01,570
Just just the dude I was about to pro 
tip another protest to show folks what a

1798
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:05,600
show.
I know.

1799
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:09,040
It's like so random it polar bears and 
odd,

1800
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:09,500
right?

1801
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,800
That's a.
that's a strange animal in that it's 

1802
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:14,800
just 100.
It's a bear,

1803
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,881
but it's 100 percent carnivorous.
There's not a vegetable to be seen up 

1804
01:17:18,881 --> 01:17:21,290
there and it's adapted.
I've seen him eat seaweed on TV.

1805
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,100
Really?
Yeah.

1806
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:27,310
I think.
I think it's because they're freaking 

1807
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,561
out because they have no sea ice anymore
and so they're just doing whatever they 

1808
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:30,570
can do to survive.
Ooh,

1809
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:36,730
that's creepy.
There's a really fucking scary video of 

1810
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,400
this.
A polar bear.

1811
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:42,610
There's a seal on an ice shelf and the 
polar bear slips up behind the seal and 

1812
01:17:43,571 --> 01:17:44,480
the seal isn't.
No,

1813
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,310
and the seals like,
oh Jesus.

1814
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:49,490
They just tries to get away and he's got
really sad look on his face.

1815
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:50,630
I've seen that video.
It's just like,

1816
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:55,680
oh you Lucille,
and he gets into the water and then the 

1817
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,780
polar bears in the water right behind 
them seconds later,

1818
01:17:56,781 --> 01:18:01,781
and then the polar bear comes out with 
an incident in his jaws as a Goddamn 

1819
01:18:01,781 --> 01:18:01,880
ruth was animal.

1820
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:03,770
It's poppy's.
Got to eat,

1821
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:05,840
was no other way.
There's no.

1822
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:08,030
And it's enormous.
So there it is.

1823
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:10,460
Look at it.
He just slowly creeps up.

1824
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,750
It slowly,
just moving around.

1825
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:16,670
And that sea lion.
Is that a sea lion?

1826
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,090
Yeah,
that's a static seal.

1827
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:24,310
So apparently they differentiate seals.
So like that one's a good tasting one 

1828
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:27,440
and then I think if it,
if this is the one that gets eaten,

1829
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:32,441
it's the good tasting one.
And then there's another one that it's 

1830
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:35,831
really nasty with the sharp teeth.
So the polar bears and leave that one 

1831
01:18:35,831 --> 01:18:35,831
alone,
like a leopard seal.

1832
01:18:35,831 --> 01:18:36,590
So when you mean,
yeah,

1833
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:41,591
it's not that bad,
but it's a that some CEO that lives up 

1834
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:42,920
in the Arctic that's kind of bad ass 
leopard seals are amazing.

1835
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,930
Oh yeah.
That's a crazy animal.

1836
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:47,000
I remember that marching at the penguins
movie.

1837
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:48,910
I didn't even know there was a leopard 
seal real.

1838
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,120
He's like,
well,

1839
01:18:50,121 --> 01:18:51,590
we're just chilling.
Look at him.

1840
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:57,320
And he just right in the water after 
him.

1841
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:02,590
Sorry Dude,
you ain't gonna make it there.

1842
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:06,690
I like the silence is kind of epic.
There's a standup comedian,

1843
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,110
Kevin Fitzgerald,
he's a,

1844
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:14,111
uh,
also a veterinarian and I worked with 

1845
01:19:14,111 --> 01:19:15,761
them once in Denver and he told me that 
polar bears are one of the few animals 

1846
01:19:15,761 --> 01:19:19,361
that when they come out of the womb to 
elect a little alien from the movie 

1847
01:19:19,361 --> 01:19:23,351
alien,
the burst out of the chest lifting to 

1848
01:19:23,351 --> 01:19:23,351
bite you.
And he's like,

1849
01:19:23,351 --> 01:19:25,370
they are predatory from the moment they 
come out of the vagina.

1850
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:31,080
Yeah.
You said they just look at you 

1851
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:31,080
different.
They look at you like your meat leds.

1852
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:31,080
Interesting.
So,

1853
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:31,610
uh,
another friend of mine,

1854
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:33,800
a woman named Rebecca who's really good 
with animals,

1855
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:34,970
she,
um,

1856
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:36,950
she works with,
she's worked with all kinds of animals,

1857
01:19:36,951 --> 01:19:39,440
but she mostly focuses on raptors now.

1858
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:40,700
But,
um,

1859
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:44,990
she worked with cats back in the day and
she said that,

1860
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:48,500
um,
mountain lions are big kitty cats.

1861
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:51,110
They're giant house cats.
So if you can understand a house cat,

1862
01:19:51,111 --> 01:19:56,111
you can understand a mountain lion 
leopards and jaguars very different 

1863
01:19:56,111 --> 01:19:56,490
thing.
It's just like,

1864
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:57,890
it's exactly what you were saying,
you know,

1865
01:19:57,891 --> 01:20:02,891
they're looking at you for you to make a
mistake and it's just a very different 

1866
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:05,600
vibe from those cats and funded and 
mountain lions.

1867
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:09,130
It's not that I remember that.
Yeah,

1868
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:10,170
don't make.
Yeah,

1869
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:12,060
it was interesting because it's,
you know,

1870
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:15,090
back to our talk about Jaguars coming 
back into the United States.

1871
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:20,540
Well,
any animal that's forced to kill things 

1872
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,671
with its face in order to stay alive,
sketchy thing to have in your 

1873
01:20:22,671 --> 01:20:24,330
neighborhood in San Francisco.
They're just so big.

1874
01:20:24,331 --> 01:20:25,860
They need so much food too.
I mean,

1875
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:29,940
you think about how big a polar bears,
how much actual meat the thing must need

1876
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:33,060
to consume in order to keep that mass a 
lot.

1877
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:33,930
I mean,
they,

1878
01:20:33,931 --> 01:20:35,160
uh,
I,

1879
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:40,080
there's a place called Ollie's big game 
lodge and packs in Nebraska and it's one

1880
01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:42,510
of these places in the middle of western
Nebraska is kind of a knower,

1881
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,380
but it's where you get off the highway 
if you've got to go eat and uh,

1882
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:47,760
and you,
you walk in,

1883
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:48,780
they're like,
holy shit,

1884
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:53,810
there's this giant 12 foot tall polar 
bear stuffed like right at the door when

1885
01:20:54,061 --> 01:20:59,061
you open up the door and it just,
it gives you an instantaneous notion of 

1886
01:20:59,061 --> 01:20:59,790
how small you are compared to a polar 
bear.

1887
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:00,900
They're the biggest,
right?

1888
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,970
Yeah.
They're bigger than a Kodiak bears.

1889
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:03,930
Yep.
Wow.

1890
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,120
Yeah.
That's a weird thing,

1891
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:11,121
right?
An animal that lives whereas no 

1892
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:13,131
vegetation and does the law all the life
comes from the sea and it's bigger than 

1893
01:21:13,131 --> 01:21:14,880
all of them.
See,

1894
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:20,270
blubber must be good.
What isn't also that principle that the 

1895
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:21,810
larger mammals Bergman's rule,
the further north you go,

1896
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:25,200
the larger body has to be in order to 
maintain his skull Bergman's rule.

1897
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,970
Thus Scandinavians.
Yeah.

1898
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:32,370
That's another animal.
Bears are that Steve Rinella likes to 

1899
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:33,210
call charismatic megafauna.
That's an,

1900
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:37,800
that's an old biological term for um,
for when back in the seventies when,

1901
01:21:37,801 --> 01:21:42,801
you know,
save the whales and everything and 

1902
01:21:42,801 --> 01:21:43,080
everybody who was studying keystone 
species like Krill or you know,

1903
01:21:43,081 --> 01:21:44,910
things that aren't very charismatic were
like,

1904
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:50,430
man,
everybody wants to say the charismatic 

1905
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:51,180
megafauna and what really is the key to 
everything of these,

1906
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:56,210
this indiscriminate Krill or you know,
this little teeny forage fish or 

1907
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:56,210
whatever,
whatever.

1908
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:59,160
Or like ants we were talking about.
They say of all the aunts died,

1909
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:02,010
there would be no life on this planet 
inside of 100 years.

1910
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:05,330
Wow.
Dead.

1911
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:08,070
Even though it might be less than 100 
years.

1912
01:22:08,071 --> 01:22:10,290
Find out what would happen if all the 
ants dot.

1913
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:12,360
I think it's actually less than 100 fire
ants.

1914
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:13,610
I hate fire ants with.

1915
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,600
They're not nice.
They're definitely.

1916
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:19,350
When I first discovered fire,
I knew they existed all the time,

1917
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:24,351
but I'd never actually encountered them 
until I was in Texas in Austin digging 

1918
01:22:24,351 --> 01:22:26,400
wild onions and these ants crawl over my
hand.

1919
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:26,850
Like,
oh look,

1920
01:22:26,851 --> 01:22:31,851
there's an isolated Florida Florida.
There were all over the place and my 

1921
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:38,850
friend Jesse is like,
people have died for sure.

1922
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:41,640
There was some little old lady.
You remember the story?

1923
01:22:41,641 --> 01:22:46,641
She tripped,
fell right onto a mound and they just 

1924
01:22:46,641 --> 01:22:47,910
consumed or with bites.
Wow.

1925
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:53,060
And just fucked her up.
They thought she was a threat and time 

1926
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:53,060
to take you out.
God,

1927
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:57,570
what's it going?
It was going to be on that poor ladies 

1928
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:57,570
soon.
I don't know.

1929
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:57,650
I don't know.
Um,

1930
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,920
you're aware of bullet ants,
right?

1931
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:00,250
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1932
01:23:00,251 --> 01:23:01,560
That's a,
that's an interesting one.

1933
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:04,200
Didn't Steve and counter Bolivia and 
Bolivia.

1934
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:06,310
It's the same place where he ate a 
monkey.

1935
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:06,750
Yeah.
No,

1936
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,590
thanks dude.
You wouldn't eat a monkey now.

1937
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,870
That's where you cross the line.
But if someone cooked it in front of you

1938
01:23:10,871 --> 01:23:15,871
and it smelled good,
it was in the bowl and you were with 

1939
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:15,871
these people and they were all eating 
at.

1940
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:16,420
You wouldn't take a bite.
I don't know.

1941
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:18,550
I'd have to judge that when I got there.
I think you would.

1942
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,220
I would probably try and get out of that
situation before it ever happened.

1943
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,240
I would worry about primate primate 
diseases,

1944
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,310
like I know they're cooking it really 
well,

1945
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:29,760
but I know that prions,
prions,

1946
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:33,040
it caused mad cow disease that come from
brain matter.

1947
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:33,710
Well,
you know,

1948
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:34,950
chronic wasting.
Yeah.

1949
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:37,630
Is that from prions as well?
Same thing.

1950
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:42,690
Yeah.
And then chronic wasting disease for 

1951
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:43,240
folks who don't know what we're talking 
about is a disease that affects dear and

1952
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:47,410
it's really common in the Midwest and 
they think that it may have originated,

1953
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:52,411
at least this is the rumor from these 
weird commercial dear farms where they 

1954
01:23:52,411 --> 01:23:56,791
grow all these deer and they all lived 
together because apparently one of the 

1955
01:23:56,791 --> 01:24:00,490
things that happens is if deer eat out 
of the same spot,

1956
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,560
like that's where it develops.

1957
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:07,560
Like if deer,
like if there's like a feed tray and 

1958
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,300
they're all eating out of the feature,
that's unnatural for the wild,

1959
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,910
right?
Yeah.

1960
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:10,660
Yeah.
It's uh,

1961
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:11,370
it's,
you know,

1962
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,300
it's one of those things that are 
difficult to.

1963
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:15,690
I mean,
I get asked about it all the time,

1964
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:16,240
like,
well,

1965
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:17,820
what do I do with,
you know,

1966
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:21,280
if I want to make chops or for I want to
make stock out of the bones of the deer,

1967
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:23,320
I shot,
what do I do with cwt?

1968
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:28,321
And it's,
I've done an exhaustive look of all the 

1969
01:24:28,321 --> 01:24:31,740
science that's out there and it's never 
jumped the species barrier to humans to 

1970
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:31,740
humans.
It's,

1971
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,380
um,
it's primarily gonna be located in,

1972
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:40,420
in spinal tissue.
So your pelvis to skull and that's not 

1973
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,600
what we know.
So if it was me,

1974
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:48,980
uh,
and there was testing available for my 

1975
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:48,980
dear,
I would absolutely do it.

1976
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:51,160
And if you're in the clear and the 
clearer and if not it was too hard.

1977
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,240
I would probably keep the limb bones but
not the uh,

1978
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,650
but not anything off the spinal column 
because I've just,

1979
01:24:56,890 --> 01:25:01,890
you know,
and you would keep the limb bones for 

1980
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:01,890
marrow.
Uh,

1981
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:02,140
yeah.
Either marrow or um,

1982
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:04,780
or making a stocks and broths.
And then,

1983
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:05,440
you know,
cooking,

1984
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:06,810
cooking shanks on the bone.
Right?

1985
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:09,640
And when you do shanks,
you braise them slow cook.

1986
01:25:09,641 --> 01:25:12,130
Um,
and that's a neglected part of,

1987
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,960
uh,
a lot of undulates right?

1988
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,740
I think it's a,
the part of the single easiest way of,

1989
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:22,180
you know,
use the stupid catchphrase opening or a 

1990
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:24,591
game because it grinding shank meat 
socks because there's so much connected 

1991
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:28,450
tissue and they're easy to solve for the
sawzall or hacksaw.

1992
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,890
They usually will fit in your pot and 
they're amazing race like that.

1993
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:38,130
And even if they,
if that's all you do different and 

1994
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:39,700
besides your butcher will like you 
because all he's got to do is solve them

1995
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,260
off,
put them in a butcher paper,

1996
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:44,940
butcher paper and bring it back to you.
Now you started your,

1997
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
your hunting and cooking career off you 
start as a chef and then you wanted to 

1998
01:25:50,441 --> 01:25:55,441
get closer and may maybe understand what
you were cooking better.

1999
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:59,440
Is that a good way to describe it?
Is that accurate as sort of.

2000
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:00,250
I mean,
I,

2001
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:05,251
uh,
I started hunting in Minnesota and my 

2002
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:05,251
best friend was the

2003
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:09,520
outdoor writer for the St Paul Pioneer 
Press and we had been fishing at the 

2004
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,810
time and then hunting season came around
and he invited me out.

2005
01:26:11,811 --> 01:26:14,270
And it hit,
well let me preface this,

2006
01:26:14,271 --> 01:26:19,271
but he'd been sort of plying me with 
mallards and with rabbits and with some 

2007
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:22,511
venison prior to me ever going out so 
that he had killed.

2008
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:25,820
He wanted you to try and this and you 
were already a shaft by then.

2009
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:30,880
Well,
at that point it was a newspaper 

2010
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:30,880
reporter.
So I started as a restaurant Cook,

2011
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,640
you know,
line cook and a low level sous chef.

2012
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:36,670
Then I went into newspapers and um,
that was still in as a newspaper 

2013
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:36,670
reporter at that point.
And I,

2014
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:38,930
I got into it because I wanted to eat 
these things.

2015
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:41,170
I loved cooking the mallards I love 
cooking pheasants.

2016
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,490
I love cooking,
you know,

2017
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,510
medicine and he can't buy it.

2018
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:49,990
So gotta learn to get it.
And the other thing that was really life

2019
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:55,001
changing about it was.
So I'm a pretty good fisherman and when 

2020
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:57,010
I'm in a place for awhile,
uh,

2021
01:26:57,020 --> 01:27:00,170
you learn to read the body water,
you know,

2022
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:03,140
in my case back in Long Island,
you learn tides,

2023
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:08,260
you learn weather patterns,
you learned all of the little 

2024
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,640
intricacies of what it takes to actually
get on fish.

2025
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
So most anglers are just and lines,
the real fisherman knows where to put 

2026
01:27:17,271 --> 01:27:20,750
the boat to find the fish,
knows how fast patrol knows what,

2027
01:27:20,751 --> 01:27:22,370
what angle to the waves you want to be 
in,

2028
01:27:22,371 --> 01:27:24,680
all these little detailed things.
And I knew that,

2029
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:30,700
uh,
my friend Chris knew this by looking at 

2030
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:30,700
the land,
like he could just take out a glance,

2031
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:30,860
you could look at a field like,
nope,

2032
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:35,861
no fences,
we're going to be in that and I didn't 

2033
01:27:35,861 --> 01:27:35,861
have,
how do you know?

2034
01:27:35,861 --> 01:27:39,580
And he just knew because he'd done this 
a zillion times and his ability to read 

2035
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,180
land,
like I could read water.

2036
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:47,050
I wanted that ability and that every bit
as much as I'm the eating part of it was

2037
01:27:48,771 --> 01:27:52,130
what brought me into it.
Now when you say that you really enjoyed

2038
01:27:52,131 --> 01:27:53,900
cooking them and you really enjoy eating
them,

2039
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:58,100
is it because the flavors are different?
They're more complex,

2040
01:27:58,101 --> 01:27:59,950
they're more like,
you know,

2041
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,960
one of the main criticisms that people 
have said to me when I talk about wild 

2042
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:06,940
game,
like,

2043
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,230
ah,
I tried Venessa in like it's game me and

2044
01:28:09,231 --> 01:28:11,960
my God damn somebody ruined you because 
it's just,

2045
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:14,580
it's not like they did something wrong 
with it.

2046
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:20,550
I mean there's two things to me.
So one I think we both agree that what 

2047
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:22,130
we would call Gamie is somebody screwed 
up,

2048
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:27,410
right?
So poor you almost 75 percent of all 

2049
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:31,190
good venison care happens before the 
meet ever gets the kitchen.

2050
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:34,310
So that can give you what we would call 
Gamey.

2051
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:39,680
But I mean I've had people eat backstrap
that it was perfectly prepared,

2052
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:41,390
perfectly cared for.
And they said,

2053
01:28:41,391 --> 01:28:46,391
well,
it's kind of gave me what they're 

2054
01:28:46,391 --> 01:28:46,391
talking about is that it doesn't taste 
like corn.

2055
01:28:46,391 --> 01:28:50,920
Every meat animal,
including to some extent salmon that we 

2056
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,900
will get an a supermarket is corn fed.
They,

2057
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:55,100
they corn feed salmon.
Yeah.

2058
01:28:55,101 --> 01:28:57,460
That it's in the pellets that they feed 
them Christ.

2059
01:28:58,030 --> 01:29:03,030
Yeah.
Goddamn corn industry that it has its 

2060
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:03,550
tentacles deep into America.
Right.

2061
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,960
And you know,
those corn tastes like it has very 

2062
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:08,960
particular favorite pillow file.
And so with,

2063
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,500
with that flavor profile is broken by 
deer that ate something else.

2064
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:15,090
People are like,
ah,

2065
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:15,810
it's different.
Well,

2066
01:29:15,811 --> 01:29:16,830
yeah,
it tastes like something.

2067
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:19,890
Someone can actually lived a life.
Tell me that about mule deer,

2068
01:29:19,891 --> 01:29:24,891
that they don't like mule deer because 
mule deer tastes like the sage that it 

2069
01:29:24,891 --> 01:29:26,310
eats and that they like white tails 
because they corn.

2070
01:29:26,311 --> 01:29:27,870
I'm like,
Jesus Christ man.

2071
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,150
Like I've had a mule deer.
They taste great.

2072
01:29:30,151 --> 01:29:32,280
You're out of your mind.
It's a no.

2073
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:35,040
Then people will say,
elk is so much better than deer.

2074
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,180
I'm like,
okay,

2075
01:29:36,181 --> 01:29:38,760
I get it.
I mean there's some minor differences in

2076
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:39,540
subtle differences

2077
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,440
if you put one next to each other.
Yeah,

2078
01:29:42,830 --> 01:29:45,080
there's a little bit of a difference,
but it's not that dramatic.

2079
01:29:45,410 --> 01:29:50,410
Like I'm a duck hunter.
The difference between a Spoonie and a 

2080
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:52,280
pin tail is profound.
What's a spoonie and what's a pin tail?

2081
01:29:52,281 --> 01:29:57,020
So a spoonie is in northern shoveler and
it's one of the least desired ducks that

2082
01:29:57,021 --> 01:29:58,610
we are then shoveler.
Yeah.

2083
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,860
And is it a,
a diver doc?

2084
01:30:00,861 --> 01:30:02,450
Is that what it is?
It's kind of a hybrid.

2085
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:03,280
Um,
it's,

2086
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:08,300
it's technically a puddle duck,
but it dives more so than the other 

2087
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:09,920
puddle duck if you don't mind explaining
to people what the differences are.

2088
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:13,130
So every bucket you've seen in a park 
with his butt up in the air,

2089
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:18,160
that's a Dabbler or a puddle duck.
So a diver duck is a duck that dives 

2090
01:30:18,821 --> 01:30:23,821
very deep and the deepest of all,
or a third kind of duck called the sea 

2091
01:30:23,821 --> 01:30:23,821
dock,
which as you might guess,

2092
01:30:23,821 --> 01:30:24,650
listen deep,
deep,

2093
01:30:24,651 --> 01:30:25,370
deep,
deep water.

2094
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,730
So divers,
we'd be like bluebills,

2095
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:29,150
canvasbacks,
redheads,

2096
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:30,060
buffalo heads,
gold,

2097
01:30:30,061 --> 01:30:31,070
Nih.
Um,

2098
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,710
and then puddle docs would be obviously 
the Mallard,

2099
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:37,040
which everybody knows.
Mallards pin tales,

2100
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:41,450
spoonie wigeon a teal.
And so in general,

2101
01:30:41,451 --> 01:30:44,330
puddle ducks tastes better than diver 
ducks because the,

2102
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,480
what they eat and,
and so,

2103
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,840
but,
but ducks are all omnivores much like 

2104
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:53,750
pigs and bears.
So you have a spoonie which loves to eat

2105
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,840
shrimp.
He things and algae may versus a pentel 

2106
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,160
which loves seeds in seeds of all time,
all kinds.

2107
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:06,220
And that's a more tasty bird.
Any bird that eats seeds as a matter of 

2108
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:07,730
habit,
human beings are going to like to eat it

2109
01:31:07,731 --> 01:31:12,731
more because it's just a creates a set 
of flavors that we're more familiar 

2110
01:31:12,731 --> 01:31:12,731
with.
Now,

2111
01:31:12,731 --> 01:31:13,790
the exception is that are kind of 
fascinating.

2112
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:18,430
If you talked to newfoundlanders where 
Icelanders or anyway,

2113
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:23,730
uh,
the people who are grown up eating 

2114
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:24,110
seabirds,
they love that fishy,

2115
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:27,400
low tidy flavor thing going on at the 
same.

2116
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,980
I see her.
You're getting hairy.

2117
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:35,020
Eyebrow.
I want to try even though I know I'll 

2118
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:37,751
hate it.
I want to try that fermented shark that 

2119
01:31:37,751 --> 01:31:37,751
they live in Iceland.
No,

2120
01:31:37,751 --> 01:31:37,760
you don't have.
You had it.

2121
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:38,920
Tell me what it's like.

2122
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:40,770
MMM.

2123
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:49,930
What's not toe.
It's fermented stinky soybeans.

2124
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,520
So I've heard of that stuff too.
It's disgusting.

2125
01:31:52,521 --> 01:31:55,610
Supposedly stinky blue,
cheesy,

2126
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:58,820
fishy ammoniated.

2127
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:02,260
It attacks your mouth.
Ammoniated.

2128
01:32:02,261 --> 01:32:03,750
Yeah.
Heavily ammoniate.

2129
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,070
Now the Iceland people with a drunk when
they eat this.

2130
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,710
I think it's just was there was nothing.
It's like a polar bear.

2131
01:32:08,711 --> 01:32:11,590
There's nothing else.
So he developed a taste for a while.

2132
01:32:11,591 --> 01:32:15,090
Apparently you can't eat that.
That shark fresh what?

2133
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,200
Yeah,
I think.

2134
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:18,880
I think it's another vitamin A or 
something like that.

2135
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:22,150
There's some reason you can't eat that.
It's a greenland shark and you can't eat

2136
01:32:22,151 --> 01:32:24,430
a greenland shark fresh.
So it was the only way to eat.

2137
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:25,120
It was too.
For a minute.

2138
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,310
How bizarre.
Yeah,

2139
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:29,630
and so they became the first guy to 
figure that one out.

2140
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:30,070
Yeah,
right.

2141
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:33,340
Let's eat the rotten one.
How to prepare it.

2142
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:39,030
You have to figure out how to ferment 
that thing because I have never seen or 

2143
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:40,000
heard of seen videos of people trying 
it.

2144
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:41,440
I've never heard anybody's tried it.

2145
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,110
They enjoyed it.
Anybody who lives in Iceland though will

2146
01:32:44,111 --> 01:32:46,360
tell you like it's a.
it's a delicacy.

2147
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:48,400
We like it.
Like I don't understand.

2148
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:53,401
I wonder what our delicacy is.
What is the thing that we either in 

2149
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:54,220
California or in the United States 
really,

2150
01:32:54,221 --> 01:32:56,800
really like that.
Everybody else in the world was like,

2151
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,720
holy crap,
how can you eat that?

2152
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:04,140
That's a good question.
I don't think we have anything like 

2153
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:04,140
that.
Our food is so bland.

2154
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:07,330
Like an American food is like,
you think of a cheeseburger and fries or

2155
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:12,331
steak and mashed potatoes.
You don't think of anything that has 

2156
01:33:12,331 --> 01:33:13,750
like an incredibly potent flavors to it.
Yeah,

2157
01:33:13,751 --> 01:33:18,751
I mean,
I can think of some regionalities like 

2158
01:33:18,751 --> 01:33:18,751
scrapple.
Right,

2159
01:33:18,751 --> 01:33:18,751
but,
but that's not you.

2160
01:33:18,751 --> 01:33:22,000
You call scrapple regional American,
but not dominant American food.

2161
01:33:22,001 --> 01:33:23,640
What's scrapple again?
Eh,

2162
01:33:23,641 --> 01:33:28,641
that's basically Lipson assholes.
Ground up really small and mixed with 

2163
01:33:28,641 --> 01:33:31,740
either cornmeal or,
or sometimes oatmeal and it still won't 

2164
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:31,810
be potent.

2165
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:33,440
It's baked it in,
is it?

2166
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:36,640
Yeah.
Liver Mush is even more potent.

2167
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:38,470
Liver,
much liver mush,

2168
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:39,310
Mush.
Really?

2169
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:44,340
It's basically that,
but it's made with liver and they're 

2170
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:46,000
both breakfast meats and you know,
I've had good scrapple.

2171
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:48,870
I've not had liver much that I really,
really enjoyed it.

2172
01:33:48,871 --> 01:33:50,230
It's kind of a uh,
uh,

2173
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,620
you see a lot in south central 
Pennsylvania,

2174
01:33:53,621 --> 01:33:55,270
West Virginia,
Tennessee,

2175
01:33:55,271 --> 01:33:57,190
that area well lit.
Well that's.

2176
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:59,410
Wow.
See,

2177
01:33:59,411 --> 01:34:00,290
that's grapple.
Yeah.

2178
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:03,290
So it's like you cut it like a low flow 
meatloaf.

2179
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,270
Yep.
And then you fry it.

2180
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:07,360
Oh Wow.
So you horrible.

2181
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:09,160
Do you boil it?
How do you get into that state?

2182
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:10,210
Oh,
it's all liquid.

2183
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:17,270
It's all liquid liquid.
It's basically like scrapple is the 

2184
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,670
scraps from the,
from slaughtering a pig.

2185
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,300
So is it almost like a gelatin thing,
like a head cheese type of a scenario?

2186
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:25,250
It is,
but I kind of,

2187
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,280
I would say is probably a more wholesome
product.

2188
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:35,870
Head cheese is very strange.
I didn't know what head Cheese Romano 

2189
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:37,330
should do tat until probably like five 
years ago.

2190
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:42,600
And uh,
I remember watching a video of someone 

2191
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:42,910
making head.
She had cheese.

2192
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:44,590
I've never had it.
It's okay.

2193
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:46,030
So here's the thing.
All it is,

2194
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:51,060
is while the German way that is really 
dig on the gelatin and I'm not super 

2195
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:57,360
heavy on the,
that gelatin comes from the collagen 

2196
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,430
breaks down and the tissues,
those

2197
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,840
take a pig's head.
Okay.

2198
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:04,990
And typically you will either have the 
ears thrown in there or you'll have an 

2199
01:35:05,971 --> 01:35:08,180
extra foot thrown in there for some more
collagen.

2200
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:13,810
You boil it slowly with a lot of spices 
and herbs until practically falls apart.

2201
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:19,980
Then you fish everything out.
And then the iron rule of,

2202
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:22,550
of head cheese making is,
if it looks like meat,

2203
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:26,420
keep it fairly big.
If you have no idea what it is,

2204
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:31,950
chop it very small and then,
and then you pack it into a loaf pan or 

2205
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:38,900
a sausage casing and then you boil down 
the cooking liquid by half and then that

2206
01:35:38,901 --> 01:35:43,901
really concentrates the gelatin and then
you pour that hot broth over the mixture

2207
01:35:44,991 --> 01:35:49,991
that you packed into the,
the loaf pan or the or the sausage 

2208
01:35:49,991 --> 01:35:53,531
casing or whatever,
and then you put it in the refrigerator 

2209
01:35:53,531 --> 01:35:55,601
and it sets and you eat it cold.
So the best head cheese as is where the 

2210
01:35:57,801 --> 01:36:02,801
gelatin is set just enough where it kind
of melts when it hits the heat of your 

2211
01:36:02,801 --> 01:36:07,061
mouth.
And so it's not 99 new sort of to a knox

2212
01:36:07,731 --> 01:36:09,470
gelatin and like,
um,

2213
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:11,540
and it's,
it's actually very,

2214
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:12,820
very good.
And it's a,

2215
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:16,190
it needs pickles and slash or mustard 
pickles and slash or.

2216
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,570
Yeah,
there's head cheese,

2217
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:18,920
so yeah,
it looks good.

2218
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,230
That looks better than scrapple.
Oh yeah.

2219
01:36:21,231 --> 01:36:22,310
It's much better than scrapple,

2220
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:24,090
but it's weird distinction.
I mean,

2221
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:25,980
I guess it's because it's not Dixon 
assholes.

2222
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:30,960
More uteruses please.
I mean,

2223
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:33,720
I've always been fascinated by sharp 
prudery.

2224
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:38,750
Just the idea that people figured out a 
long time ago how to draw things and 

2225
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:39,060
preserved thing.
That's it.

2226
01:36:39,061 --> 01:36:39,560
Had cheese.
Okay.

2227
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:40,720
That's my.
That's how I make it.

2228
01:36:40,721 --> 01:36:42,670
That's called Beta tested.
That's an Italian style.

2229
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:44,830
Okay.
And then you slice it very thin.

2230
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:47,080
See that arc thing and the bottom left 
hand corner.

2231
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:49,540
That's a little bit slice of pig ear.

2232
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:51,440
Oh Wow.
Really?

2233
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:54,450
And that's edible.
You can now yet.

2234
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:56,100
Well,
it's been boiled for hours and hours.

2235
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:58,580
Just become superintendent because I 
think of them as things.

2236
01:36:58,581 --> 01:37:03,581
I feed my dogs.
Those are the pet store if they're not 

2237
01:37:03,581 --> 01:37:03,581
boiled.
Yeah,

2238
01:37:03,581 --> 01:37:03,710
yeah.
Pigs are a weird one,

2239
01:37:03,711 --> 01:37:08,711
man.
That's such a weird thing because you 

2240
01:37:08,711 --> 01:37:10,541
find out how smart they are and like 
commercial pig farming becomes very 

2241
01:37:10,541 --> 01:37:11,420
disturbing.
I find out how.

2242
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:13,780
That's another reason why I got into 
hunting so too.

2243
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:17,250
I have not bought meat or fish for the 
house since [inaudible].

2244
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:19,420
That's awesome.
With maybe a handful of exceptions.

2245
01:37:19,421 --> 01:37:22,530
I bought a chicken a couple of times,
but part of that is I.

2246
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:25,810
I would prefer to opt out of that system
because you're exactly right.

2247
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:31,420
Yeah.
I just did a podcast recently with my 

2248
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:31,420
friend Ari,
Ari Shaffir,

2249
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:35,771
who's a stand up comedian and his,
his podcast is called the skeptic tank 

2250
01:37:35,771 --> 01:37:38,981
and we went into that because he's never
a hunted and he asked me about it and 

2251
01:37:38,981 --> 01:37:43,391
that is what I gave him is pretty much 
my reason for doing it in the first 

2252
01:37:43,391 --> 01:37:47,111
place.
I felt like I didn't want to be a part 

2253
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:47,111
of that system anymore and I wasn't sure
if I wanted to be a vegetarian.

2254
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,770
I was like,
it's going to be one of these things,

2255
01:37:48,771 --> 01:37:51,500
either vegetarian or a hunter,
so let me try this hunting thing.

2256
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:56,250
And then I got into it.
But it's the connection with the food.

2257
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:01,520
It becomes.
It becomes a completely different 

2258
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,981
experience and it's so hard to explain 
that without sounding pretentious or 

2259
01:38:03,981 --> 01:38:06,480
without just repeating myself over and 
over again,

2260
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:07,230
which I've done many,
many,

2261
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:08,880
many,
many times on this podcast.

2262
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,520
But when you,
if I'll,

2263
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:14,970
I'll pull like an elk backstrap out of 
the freezer tonight and I'll thought out

2264
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:16,620
and I'll,
you know,

2265
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:21,640
marinade,
put some kosher salt and pepper and 

2266
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:22,230
grill it.
And it's a wonderful experience.

2267
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:24,240
Like while I'm cooking this thing,
I'm all excited.

2268
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:26,280
I remember the hunt,
I remember,

2269
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:27,680
you know,
seeing the elk,

2270
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:28,680
the whole thing.
I mean,

2271
01:38:28,681 --> 01:38:30,020
it's just,
it's a totally to.

2272
01:38:30,030 --> 01:38:35,030
And when you're eating it,
it's just rich with vitamins and flavor 

2273
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:35,180
and it's alive.
I mean,

2274
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,350
it's definitely not alive,
but I mean,

2275
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:42,380
it has this taste to it.
It's just so different than anything 

2276
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:42,380
you're going to buy in a store.
Well,

2277
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:45,960
for me as a cook,
having entered this whole game as a,

2278
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:48,420
as a cook or you know,
this pursuit of hunting,

2279
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:54,030
um,
it really challenges me to make great 

2280
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:54,720
food out of every bet because,
you know,

2281
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:55,500
you broke it,
you bought it.

2282
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:59,010
And tacos to language made from elk 
tongue,

2283
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,150
phenomenal.
Um,

2284
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:04,020
head cheese made from a dose head,
a brace.

2285
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:07,980
Shanks a hell I even,
I even made a venison tripe.

2286
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:13,580
One of the most delicious meals that I 
ever cooked with wild game was on our 

2287
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:15,870
first hunt Rinella.
I'm cooked a deer head in the ground.

2288
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,770
Oh yeah.
Sky,

2289
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:18,580
like,
uh,

2290
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,160
he,
he read about it in that book,

2291
01:39:20,161 --> 01:39:22,380
Big Sky,
the Guthrie Book.

2292
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:25,320
And he decided that he wanted to try it 
that way.

2293
01:39:25,321 --> 01:39:26,790
So this is like the first time you ever 
tried it.

2294
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:30,120
And we buried this thing.
We put hot coals,

2295
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:34,500
you wrapped it up in a cloth and a wet 
cloth,

2296
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,170
put it under ground,
poured hot coals all over.

2297
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,230
And I do not remember,
but it was amazing.

2298
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:41,880
Whatever he did,
he did it right.

2299
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:43,680
And maybe he didn't solve it.
I don't remember.

2300
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:45,990
I love Steve will always take the hard 
way out.

2301
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:48,270
Oh,
he's the hardest motherfucker on earth.

2302
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,460
Every time I out with him I feel like a 
pussy.

2303
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,840
He just always wanted to do everything 
hard and if he doesn't get miserable.

2304
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:59,100
Like I watched a show once where he saw 
this giant bull elk on the first day.

2305
01:39:59,101 --> 01:40:04,101
It was hunt within the first couple of 
hours and he didn't shoot it because he 

2306
01:40:04,101 --> 01:40:07,311
didn't want to be done hunting.
When that's why you go fishing 

2307
01:40:07,311 --> 01:40:07,311
afterwards.
I'm like,

2308
01:40:07,311 --> 01:40:09,120
you're out of your fucking time to go 
fishing.

2309
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,380
He explained it to me afterwards.
It made more sense and it was because he

2310
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:18,381
had just come from Kentucky where he had
did another show and he had shot an elk 

2311
01:40:18,381 --> 01:40:20,040
and Kentucky like literally the week 
before,

2312
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,950
so he felt bad about shooting one right 
away.

2313
01:40:22,951 --> 01:40:27,951
I'm like,
it's not like you're going to let it go 

2314
01:40:27,951 --> 01:40:27,951
to waste.
Right?

2315
01:40:27,951 --> 01:40:27,951
And he's like,
well,

2316
01:40:27,951 --> 01:40:31,291
we have to make a show and I can just 
shoot it on the first day of shoot on 

2317
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:32,640
the first day and then pretend you're 
looking for an l three days afterwards.

2318
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:33,480
Jesus Christ,
I,

2319
01:40:33,481 --> 01:40:36,270
you know about editing your hot tea 
because he's so.

2320
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:41,480
He has.
So his ethics are so strong and his 

2321
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,000
inability to be disingenuous is so 
powerful that he won't do that.

2322
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,590
Well,
the one I did with him was like,

2323
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:49,340
Hey,
I'm,

2324
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,540
I'm older than he is.
I'm like,

2325
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:55,550
I'd like to climb to the top of this 
mountain and look for things and then 

2326
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:55,550
sit here for,
until

2327
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:55,960
I find something and then walk to that 
thing and shoot it.

2328
01:40:56,390 --> 01:41:01,390
He's like,
let's climb all over these mountains 

2329
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:01,390
like woo.
And I'm like,

2330
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:01,650
Oh dude,
I'm just going to sit here and like,

2331
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:04,150
this is where we saw deer.
I'm going to know as it turned out,

2332
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:07,420
he was right.
He knows what he's doing.

2333
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:09,740
I want an a mule deer hunt with them 
recently and you know,

2334
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:10,900
I was like,
let's go after them now.

2335
01:41:10,901 --> 01:41:11,210
He's like,
no,

2336
01:41:11,211 --> 01:41:11,500
no,
no.

2337
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,540
Just sit and wait.
You don't want to blow them out.

2338
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,700
I'm like,
you sure just go,

2339
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:16,450
let's go.
He's like,

2340
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:17,620
you can go if you want them.
Okay,

2341
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:19,780
go down the hill.
They're gone.

2342
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:21,580
If I could take off.
He's like,

2343
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:22,640
well,
go after him tomorrow.

2344
01:41:22,641 --> 01:41:23,870
I'm like,
tomorrow,

2345
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:25,720
like,
but it's like one of those things,

2346
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:29,410
what you friend could read the land.
Like you have to listen.

2347
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:33,670
Like when you,
when you have someone that has this deep

2348
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:37,210
experience in something that's very odd 
information,

2349
01:41:37,211 --> 01:41:39,290
like where the quail will be.
I gotTa,

2350
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:40,270
you know,
Dude,

2351
01:41:40,271 --> 01:41:42,280
I've been doing this.
I had that with ducks.

2352
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,130
I can do that with ducks and geese.
Is that your favorite bird?

2353
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:46,340
It's,
well,

2354
01:41:46,341 --> 01:41:49,150
I don't have my favorite favorite book.
Maybe grouse,

2355
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:50,680
grouse,
maybe never had it.

2356
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:51,790
Uh,
what's it like?

2357
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:56,410
Imagine it's what a chicken dreams about
being when it grows up and goes wild.

2358
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:00,880
It's a wild chicken.
It's a little tiny wild chicken.

2359
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:03,580
They're not that tiny.
What's a fat grouse?

2360
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:08,610
I shot a big blue grouse in Utah that 
plucked gutted and dress just it looked 

2361
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,480
Jessica chicken you buy in the store was
two pounds.

2362
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:15,400
Woo.
That was pretty heavy.

2363
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:19,600
That's about as big as they get.
That's like about like that.

2364
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:20,980
That's a pretty big animal.

2365
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,890
No kidding.
And Sage grouse or even bigger?

2366
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:29,340
A really.
What's like the biggest world record 

2367
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:30,100
grouse,
like a five pound grouse Capercaillie in

2368
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:33,440
Sweden there I think there were like 15 
pounds or so.

2369
01:42:33,441 --> 01:42:34,390
Oh,
it's a fucking Turkey.

2370
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:35,920
Pretty much.
They don't have turkeys there.

2371
01:42:35,921 --> 01:42:36,970
So.
Wow.

2372
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So I mean I guess the biggest gallon 
[inaudible] bird would be the Turkey I 

2373
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:42,330
was interested in.
Um,

2374
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:46,300
what the difference between wild Turkey 
and regular Turkey is.

2375
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:49,580
And it's surprisingly not as big as you 
might think.

2376
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:52,990
The breast was almost identical except 
it's very narrow,

2377
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:58,410
but the wings and the other brother,
the drumsticks did have a different 

2378
01:42:58,410 --> 01:42:58,410
flavor to them.
Yeah,

2379
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:02,710
it was more just more distinct and they 
worked for living.

2380
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,240
Yes,
they're out there hustling.

2381
01:43:04,241 --> 01:43:05,260
Yeah.
Which is the same.

2382
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:10,261
You could say about pigs,
like the darkness of the meat of wild 

2383
01:43:10,261 --> 01:43:12,790
pig is so preferable to a domestic pigs.

2384
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,320
I love,
I loved shooting wild hogs.

2385
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:17,030
Well you have to,
first of all,

2386
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:19,720
that's one of those things.
That's one of the animals that really,

2387
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:23,830
when you talk to people that are anti 
hunting and anti,

2388
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:25,930
they just want to let nature run its 
course.

2389
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:28,330
Like there's some animals where you 
literally can't do that,

2390
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:31,000
like pigs or one of them.
Especially invasive pigs.

2391
01:43:31,001 --> 01:43:34,030
I had no so 500 pigs in California for 
years and years and years.

2392
01:43:34,031 --> 01:43:39,031
So,
and I've heard all these stories about 

2393
01:43:39,031 --> 01:43:40,450
Texas and a few years ago I finally went
down to South East Texas to do.

2394
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,470
I do punting and cooking schools.
And um,

2395
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:47,880
so the guy,
I was working with this in Bay city and 

2396
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:49,630
so we're down there and uh,
he's like,

2397
01:43:49,631 --> 01:43:54,631
okay,
first thing you have to understand is 

2398
01:43:54,631 --> 01:43:54,631
that these are a problem.
Like when we were talking about.

2399
01:43:54,631 --> 01:43:58,580
So we went out and there are these herds
of pigs and like 90 pigs in a shot,

2400
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:04,030
the walk into a field to do $100,000
damage in one night and it's,

2401
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:08,090
it's astonishing and this is all year 
round and I had no idea like,

2402
01:44:08,091 --> 01:44:10,910
because you know,
if you found it pigs in California,

2403
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:11,840
it's a hunt.

2404
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:17,590
If you go to Texas,
it's like how many can you kill and you 

2405
01:44:17,991 --> 01:44:22,991
still won't make a dent on the 
population as a story that I've told 

2406
01:44:22,991 --> 01:44:22,991
before.
But I'll tell it again just for the sake

2407
01:44:22,991 --> 01:44:27,611
of this conversation.
There's a new highway they opened up in 

2408
01:44:27,611 --> 01:44:27,710
Texas and the first night they opened up
the road.

2409
01:44:27,711 --> 01:44:32,711
Forty car accidents with pigs.
Lao just overrun.

2410
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:36,400
They were just overrun with big.
Yeah.

2411
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:41,980
Car accidents and wild game and 
population control is one of the most 

2412
01:44:42,351 --> 01:44:45,570
surprising statistics when you give them
to tell people $2,

2413
01:44:45,571 --> 01:44:50,571
million car accidents with deer every 
year and the one point $5 million at 

2414
01:44:50,571 --> 01:44:51,800
least in the United States with,
with deer.

2415
01:44:51,801 --> 01:44:53,590
And they will what?
Like people don't know.

2416
01:44:53,591 --> 01:44:54,460
Go what?
Oh,

2417
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:58,310
you're one and a half million car 
accidents with deer a year.

2418
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:03,080
Just the United States and they're 
delicious.

2419
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:04,610
Yeah.
Years ago I did.

2420
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:09,670
I was working at the pipe press pioneer 
press and St Paul and I did a data 

2421
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:10,760
analysis,
one of the first ones that was ever done

2422
01:45:10,761 --> 01:45:14,600
and try dear vehicle collisions and 
apparently if you're in an oca county,

2423
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:17,540
north of the twin cities on November 
eighth at dusk,

2424
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:18,650
watch your ass.

2425
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,400
That's the one day that was like,
so you'd like.

2426
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:24,140
There's a huge cluster right there.
Well,

2427
01:45:24,141 --> 01:45:25,640
the November is the Rut.
Yeah,

2428
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:30,720
November.
That's when they just get completely 

2429
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:30,720
bonkers.
You're running into traffic and.

2430
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:34,930
Well,
you've been to a singles bar at closing 

2431
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:34,930
time.
Yes.

2432
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:34,930
Well,
I've also been an Iowa in the Rut.

2433
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:36,710
Was just there a few weeks ago.
You got to Iowa Tag.

2434
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:42,070
Yes.
I got a governor's tag for my buddy of 

2435
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:45,311
mine.
Owns some property out there and knows 

2436
01:45:45,311 --> 01:45:45,311
people.
You're lucky.

2437
01:45:45,311 --> 01:45:45,311
Yes.
Very lucky.

2438
01:45:45,311 --> 01:45:45,970
Yeah,
you could get one there.

2439
01:45:45,971 --> 01:45:48,050
It takes a couple of years.
He put it in points.

2440
01:45:48,051 --> 01:45:50,590
You can get one every five years.
But um,

2441
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:52,370
I was amazing,
like the,

2442
01:45:52,371 --> 01:45:57,371
the white tail population is so strong 
and one of the reasons is they don't 

2443
01:45:57,371 --> 01:45:57,800
have a rifle season.
Right?

2444
01:45:57,801 --> 01:46:02,801
It's on only shotgun and archery.
So you gotta work for it because if 

2445
01:46:02,801 --> 01:46:03,060
you're going to shoot some of the 
shotgun,

2446
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,280
you got to be pretty fucking close.

2447
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:06,770
I'd rather use a bow even with,
uh,

2448
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:08,160
with uh,
say bit rifle,

2449
01:46:08,161 --> 01:46:11,180
barrel slug.
You still talking a hundred yards.

2450
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:12,640
Is that the most you could shoot?
Went out.

2451
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:17,920
I've heard guys shoot farther but 
weekend and week out 100 yards with 

2452
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,540
those rifled save at slugs.
And I would imagine there's a giant drop

2453
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:23,180
to how far it falls in 100 yards.
Yeah,

2454
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:28,200
you gotta be aware of it.
It's like she didn't have top of the 

2455
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,431
back about a hundred yards.
I showed it to 70 and I lose two inches 

2456
01:46:30,431 --> 01:46:32,600
at 300.
And I've heard this with some places,

2457
01:46:32,630 --> 01:46:35,120
some states that allow you to use 
shotguns,

2458
01:46:35,121 --> 01:46:37,430
but you can't use a scope.
Oh,

2459
01:46:37,431 --> 01:46:38,180
that's interesting.
Yeah.

2460
01:46:38,181 --> 01:46:40,520
You can't use the scope on the shotgun.
You have to use the old,

2461
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:44,180
the old timey iron sights or you could 
probably use a peep site.

2462
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:47,650
Do you have a favorite game that you 
enjoy cooking?

2463
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:49,950
Is there anything that you like this is 
my favorite

2464
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:53,040
game to cook in a variety of different 
ways?

2465
01:46:53,041 --> 01:46:54,150
Or do you just like all of them?

2466
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:59,380
Well,
I think if you're talking about a 

2467
01:46:59,380 --> 01:46:59,380
variety of different ways,
ducks and venison,

2468
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:03,280
um,
but if you're talking about favorite 

2469
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:04,430
thing to cook it in general,
go back to grouse.

2470
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:09,380
But graphs are not as versatile but I 
love the flavor of grouse,

2471
01:47:09,410 --> 01:47:09,980
but it's,
you know,

2472
01:47:09,981 --> 01:47:11,120
it's a whole bird you're cooking.

2473
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:14,120
And is it just,
is it because of its wild diet?

2474
01:47:14,121 --> 01:47:16,260
It just has a more complex flavor to it.
Is it?

2475
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:17,800
Very much so it's,
it's,

2476
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:19,400
there's nothing that tastes like a 
grouse.

2477
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:21,170
The,
it's sort of like a chicken,

2478
01:47:21,171 --> 01:47:23,720
but you'll know you're eating grass now.

2479
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:29,190
Well,
I didn't know this either until fairly 

2480
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:29,190
recently that the,
as you were explaining before,

2481
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:33,121
that there's different kinds of ducks 
and the ducks and the seeds are 

2482
01:47:33,121 --> 01:47:34,360
preferable,
but diver ducks you can eat,

2483
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:36,080
but they have like,
do you,

2484
01:47:36,081 --> 01:47:37,190
do you enjoy them?
Oh yeah.

2485
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:40,750
And they have like a fishy taste or 
because they primarily seafood.

2486
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:42,160
So,
uh,

2487
01:47:42,610 --> 01:47:45,190
this is a great example of Diet.
So brant,

2488
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,150
which is like a sea goose,
um,

2489
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:52,190
there's east coast brand and west coast 
brand and the season just ended 

2490
01:47:52,190 --> 01:47:54,850
yesterday I think on Brandon and they,
um,

2491
01:47:55,300 --> 01:48:00,030
and so on the west coast,
they are the best eating waterfowl.

2492
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:04,420
There is period Barton because they eat 
eel grass in there have a very clean,

2493
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:07,930
almost celine flavor.
It's very fishy.

2494
01:48:07,931 --> 01:48:09,190
It's not Pondi,
it's just,

2495
01:48:09,191 --> 01:48:11,200
it's,
it's a fantastic birds.

2496
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:14,890
You shoot it,
the brand and the east coast in the East

2497
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:19,360
Sea lettuce a see a seaweed revolting,
like barely edible.

2498
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:22,510
Really,
like barely just got to chew through it.

2499
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:23,890
Yeah.
But you know,

2500
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:25,570
so canvas backs.
Are there a diver?

2501
01:48:25,571 --> 01:48:26,830
Red Heads?
They're a diver.

2502
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:28,690
Uh,
for the most part I'll always pluck them

2503
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:32,080
because they have a different diet and,
but on the other hand,

2504
01:48:32,230 --> 01:48:37,230
Goldeneye as buffalo heads most blue 
bills but not all ring next.

2505
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:40,330
A lot of those birds,
you know,

2506
01:48:40,331 --> 01:48:41,350
there's still tastes good,
but I'll,

2507
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:42,340
I'll tend to skin them.

2508
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:47,790
It is really fascinating to me that the 
taste of when you eat an animal depends 

2509
01:48:47,801 --> 01:48:52,510
so much on what the animal's diet is and
then it makes me think about my own diet

2510
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:55,570
and like what is going on with the cells
of my own body.

2511
01:48:55,720 --> 01:49:00,720
And you think about people that are on 
poor diets that have terrible food that 

2512
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,070
they consume and they choose to drink 
soda all the time and they,

2513
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:06,190
their tissue itself is affected.
So drastic lung pig,

2514
01:49:06,191 --> 01:49:07,260
this one sweet.
Oh,

2515
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:11,020
long pig animals called human.
I don't know what that accident was,

2516
01:49:11,021 --> 01:49:15,310
but I don't like it.
Have you ever had blueberry bear?

2517
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:18,140
Um,
I've had Manzanita bear.

2518
01:49:18,650 --> 01:49:19,950
What's that?
So Anthony,

2519
01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:21,730
is it just a different bearer?
A,

2520
01:49:21,731 --> 01:49:24,080
just a different barrier that bears 
loved to eat in northern California.

2521
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:24,910
Oh,
okay.

2522
01:49:24,911 --> 01:49:28,030
And how was it similar to like the 
blueberry bear concept?

2523
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:29,520
Well,
they didn't turn anything blue,

2524
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:31,500
but uh,
but it was a,

2525
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:33,900
it was amazing.
I mean it was super sweet,

2526
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:35,730
super fatty.
Just very mild.

2527
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:41,170
Yeah,
that's what I hear that blueberry bear 

2528
01:49:41,170 --> 01:49:43,781
is like the ultimate game.
I think you get a bear in the fall 

2529
01:49:43,781 --> 01:49:46,880
that's been eating blueberries and like 
Rinella did a whole episode.

2530
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,010
It on his show where he

2531
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,890
cut one open and it had purple fat.
Crazy.

2532
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:52,960
Amazing.
There's actually a better one.

2533
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:55,810
And it lives right near you.
So legend has it.

2534
01:49:55,930 --> 01:50:00,930
So I believe the state record,
black bear and California as a 700 

2535
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:01,550
pounder from the San Gabriel mountains 
in Ventura.

2536
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:03,070
Trust.
So.

2537
01:50:03,071 --> 01:50:05,260
Or it's been from Ventura County.
From Ventura.

2538
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:07,210
Yes.
700 prejudice on far.

2539
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:12,300
So apparently these bears live in the 
mountains and they come down to the 

2540
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:14,110
avocado groves and gorge themselves on 
Avocados.

2541
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:19,740
And it's been,
it's one of my bucket list goals is to 

2542
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:23,401
get what they call a guacamole bear.
A guacamole because that's supposed to 

2543
01:50:23,401 --> 01:50:28,261
be really good.
Only imagine how delicious a avocado 

2544
01:50:28,261 --> 01:50:29,860
eating bear would taste.
I wonder if it would affect it that much

2545
01:50:29,861 --> 01:50:32,230
because Avocados are a fairly mild 
fruit,

2546
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,310
but as a fruit.
Right,

2547
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:34,570
but when you consider all the kind of 
fruit,

2548
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:36,610
but the fact quality would be amazing.

2549
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:38,500
Yeah.
It was very rich and fat.

2550
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:40,900
Right.
I eat a lot of Avocados.

2551
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:47,370
I wonder if I would see.
The thing about the blueberry bear 

2552
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:50,941
though is that it's got that engaging 
sort of sweetness to it that I think 

2553
01:50:50,941 --> 01:50:55,351
would be really interesting.
I don't think you'd get that from the 

2554
01:50:55,351 --> 01:50:57,301
avocado.
Now you have an urge to eat Mexican 

2555
01:50:57,301 --> 01:50:57,301
food,
I think.

2556
01:50:57,301 --> 01:50:57,301
Is that what?
Is this,

2557
01:50:57,301 --> 01:50:57,910
the other Rinella One?
Yeah.

2558
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:02,920
It's just showing how many cuts into it.
This fat has this insane sort of Blueish

2559
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:06,480
hint to it,
Huh?

2560
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:08,710
Yeah.
He can see how that.

2561
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:11,220
Is this when he gets himself?
No,

2562
01:51:11,410 --> 01:51:14,020
that was later.
That was the.

2563
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:15,570
Yeah.
Well,

2564
01:51:15,571 --> 01:51:17,170
it's just,
he's just crazy.

2565
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:22,200
He's still.
The best part is that everything is 

2566
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:22,200
fucking guy.
He said trick gnosis.

2567
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:22,850
He's had lyme disease.
Get charged for the ups.

2568
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:23,620
Yeah.
Oh,

2569
01:51:23,621 --> 01:51:25,090
he got Giardia.
Giardia.

2570
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:26,470
Yeah.
If you.

2571
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:29,140
Um,
the other cool thing is that if you were

2572
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:32,440
to get one of these guacamole bears,
you can freeze it and be free of chicken

2573
01:51:32,441 --> 01:51:37,441
houses because south of about Oregon 
draw a line all the way across the 

2574
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:40,870
country.
The bears there,

2575
01:51:40,871 --> 01:51:43,050
if they have it,
will tend to have a,

2576
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:46,100
a variety called trick and trick and 
Ellis by Rallis,

2577
01:51:46,630 --> 01:51:49,240
which you can kill by freezing.
Interesting.

2578
01:51:49,241 --> 01:51:54,241
So,
but north of there from the northern 

2579
01:51:54,241 --> 01:51:54,241
tier of this country and all Canada and 
Alaska,

2580
01:51:54,241 --> 01:51:58,140
it's called trick and I nativa and that 
one is resistant to freezing so it stays

2581
01:51:58,271 --> 01:52:00,910
alive even if you have it in the freezer
for months.

2582
01:52:00,930 --> 01:52:02,440
Right.
That's sick.

2583
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:04,090
Creepy animal.
I know.

2584
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:05,170
Well,
I mean it's from up there.

2585
01:52:05,171 --> 01:52:06,340
So it must be,
you know,

2586
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:07,690
frost,
frost resistant.

2587
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:10,570
I was surprised how good beer taste I 
was too.

2588
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:12,490
Yeah.
That's one of those ones where you go,

2589
01:52:12,491 --> 01:52:15,430
I don't know if I want to eat this.
This is just a teddy bear.

2590
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:20,460
St Says Yogi.
This is all the amp for more physicians 

2591
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:20,980
of ours.
Madec megafauna.

2592
01:52:21,490 --> 01:52:24,430
That's the weird.
I've never had people more mad at me for

2593
01:52:24,431 --> 01:52:26,070
anything.
I've ever shot than bear,

2594
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:29,770
like they don't.
People don't seem to be that mad about a

2595
01:52:29,771 --> 01:52:31,030
deer.
Some people are,

2596
01:52:31,031 --> 01:52:33,790
but most people understand it like you 
ate that you're going to eat it.

2597
01:52:33,791 --> 01:52:38,791
That's the way shot.
And we are who we are because we hunt 

2598
01:52:38,791 --> 01:52:38,791
deer know,
anthropologically speaking.

2599
01:52:38,791 --> 01:52:43,000
I mean there's all kinds of evidence to 
show that the reason why we can run,

2600
01:52:43,001 --> 01:52:46,010
we were the only primate with an arch.
The reason

2601
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:51,010
that we can actually throw properly,
the reason why that we can communicate 

2602
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:52,910
so complicated in so many complicated 
ways.

2603
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:56,120
There's all kinds of reasons that the 
structure of our shoulders,

2604
01:52:56,121 --> 01:53:01,121
the structure of our hips that are a 
great amount of the way we're built in 

2605
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:06,191
the way we think and the way we act has 
to do with us teaming up to hunt large 

2606
01:53:06,631 --> 01:53:08,590
deer.
Like things real [inaudible].

2607
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:10,700
Where'd you get this?
All over the,

2608
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,800
um,
the anthropological literature.

2609
01:53:12,801 --> 01:53:14,240
I mean,
I could cite you a bunch of books,

2610
01:53:14,241 --> 01:53:15,980
but um,
but there's,

2611
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:17,570
I mean,
obviously it's debatable,

2612
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:21,680
but the consensus is that there's an 
enormous amount of,

2613
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:27,720
uh,
of developments that stemmed out of 

2614
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:32,110
pursuit hunting.
And ganging up on things like mammoths 

2615
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:34,460
and rhinos and large,
basically large,

2616
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:37,010
large herbivores.
And,

2617
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:40,880
you know,
that's why we were hardwired hunt deer.

2618
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:43,320
Well,
one of the things that I said that I was

2619
01:53:43,321 --> 01:53:47,310
describing to my friend Ari about it as 
there's this strange familiarity.

2620
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,260
Yep.
Uh,

2621
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:53,330
and almost like this,
a deep reward system that gets plugged 

2622
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:57,501
into that you weren't even aware that 
you had when the deer's down and you 

2623
01:53:57,501 --> 01:53:59,100
know,
when you're quartering it and cutting it

2624
01:53:59,101 --> 01:53:59,580
up,
it's like,

2625
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,140
oh,
I kind of know how to do this,

2626
01:54:01,141 --> 01:54:04,200
or at least I don't know how to do this,
but this seems normal to me.

2627
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:05,310
It seems familiar.

2628
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:06,840
I mean,
we've been in.

2629
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:11,900
This is the other thing about some of 
the research I've been doing lately is 

2630
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:12,910
that everybody hunts deer or something 
like a deer.

2631
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:17,730
So all over the world.
So my banker guy named Omar,

2632
01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:20,780
uh,
I was doing some banking stuff and I was

2633
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,780
talking to him about the book I just 
wrote.

2634
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:25,240
And he said,
Oh yeah,

2635
01:54:25,241 --> 01:54:30,241
you know,
I really miss hunting gazelles and the 

2636
01:54:30,241 --> 01:54:31,070
eastern deserts of Lebanon.
Oh,

2637
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:31,830
right.
I,

2638
01:54:32,110 --> 01:54:37,110
it's the same reaction as you know,
I have a friend from the Yucatan who 

2639
01:54:37,110 --> 01:54:37,960
hunts deer in the Yucatan and you know,
I've uh,

2640
01:54:37,961 --> 01:54:42,961
uh,
another friend from Hokkaido in the 

2641
01:54:42,961 --> 01:54:45,300
Northern Ireland in Japan who,
who hunts the same sick of blacktail in 

2642
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:48,440
Alaska now that he used to hunt in 
Hokkaido as a kid and you know,

2643
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:50,300
South Africans and New Zealanders and 
men,

2644
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:53,320
even if you can be for,
if you're smart and thinking out there,

2645
01:54:53,321 --> 01:54:53,940
you're going to say,
well,

2646
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:56,350
what about Australia and Australia?
I mean,

2647
01:54:56,351 --> 01:55:01,351
if,
I don't know if you've ever eaten 

2648
01:55:01,351 --> 01:55:01,351
kangaroo,
but kangaroo looks exactly like medicine

2649
01:55:01,351 --> 01:55:01,351
and pretty much tastes like medicine.
Yeah,

2650
01:55:01,351 --> 01:55:02,080
it's a crazy deer,
right?

2651
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:05,980
It's kind of strange.
Sort of a weird hopping deer with a tail

2652
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:06,880
ish.
Yeah.

2653
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:08,230
Uh,
so let me,

2654
01:55:08,231 --> 01:55:09,290
there's.
So the,

2655
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:13,940
the human connection with hunting and 
eating something like a deer is very,

2656
01:55:13,941 --> 01:55:15,550
very,
is worldwide and in very,

2657
01:55:15,551 --> 01:55:16,630
very deep.

2658
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:19,370
Now this new book that you have here,
I've been reading it,

2659
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,260
I was reading it today actually,
buck,

2660
01:55:21,261 --> 01:55:26,261
Buck Moose.
That's a lot of really interesting 

2661
01:55:26,261 --> 01:55:29,270
information about animals and about how 
to prepare them.

2662
01:55:29,271 --> 01:55:34,271
The difference.
One of the things that I thought it was 

2663
01:55:34,271 --> 01:55:35,921
really funny,
it was the whole point about 

2664
01:55:35,921 --> 01:55:35,921
testosterone.
Testosterone stinks.

2665
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:40,070
And like the animals that everybody 
wants the big bucks with the big racks,

2666
01:55:40,071 --> 01:55:45,071
they're going to be smelly animals.
They're going to be tougher if you get 

2667
01:55:45,071 --> 01:55:45,071
them before the Rut,

2668
01:55:45,071 --> 01:55:46,470
which is not easy,
but if you get them before the route,

2669
01:55:46,471 --> 01:55:49,860
they're perfectly fine.
But that's the rub is that,

2670
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:52,800
that's when they're easiest to get,
when they're all horny and confused.

2671
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:54,020
Yep.
Um,

2672
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:57,780
but you've got some great fucking 
recipes and ideas in here,

2673
01:55:57,781 --> 01:55:58,280
man.
How,

2674
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:01,410
how long did it take you to put this 
together over?

2675
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:03,420
I've started a,
I don't know,

2676
01:56:03,421 --> 01:56:05,340
maybe some of it 10 years,
but,

2677
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:07,590
but actually sitting there writing it 
two years.

2678
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:09,860
Um,
you know,

2679
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:14,870
because all the recipes,
I had a test and I had to send the 

2680
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:14,870
recipes out to,
uh,

2681
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:19,900
you know,
lots of readers because one of the 

2682
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:21,420
things is important for me is that my 
recipes are as water tight as possible.

2683
01:56:21,421 --> 01:56:26,421
So I send them out to civilians.
I don't let other chefs test my recipes 

2684
01:56:26,421 --> 01:56:27,030
because I,
first of all,

2685
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:27,930
they're not gonna follow the recipe.

2686
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:29,970
Second of all,
they wouldn't.

2687
01:56:29,971 --> 01:56:31,510
They would have their own bullshit.
Oh yeah.

2688
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:33,030
Because it's just you.
They can't help themselves.

2689
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:34,860
So no kidding.
It just is.

2690
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:37,200
It's,
I'm happy I'm at peace with it.

2691
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:39,090
But uh,
but I.

2692
01:56:39,091 --> 01:56:44,091
What I want is for somebody who reads 
what I write to be able to make what I 

2693
01:56:44,091 --> 01:56:48,891
made.
So anybody who's ever sent a text 

2694
01:56:48,891 --> 01:56:50,280
message knows that if you ever send a 
text message,

2695
01:56:50,281 --> 01:56:53,040
what you write is not necessarily what 
the person hears in their head.

2696
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:55,610
Right?
So at that can't,

2697
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,380
that can't go if I'm writing a recipe,
because especially because,

2698
01:56:58,381 --> 01:56:59,070
think about it,
right?

2699
01:56:59,370 --> 01:57:00,660
If I'm going to tell you to do x,
y,

2700
01:57:00,661 --> 01:57:04,560
or z with the tenderloin,
there's only one.

2701
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:09,620
You only get one shot at it.
There's only one set of tenderloins on 

2702
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:13,011
any animal.
And if I'm going to tell you to do 

2703
01:57:13,011 --> 01:57:14,961
something with it,
that's beyond whatever it is that you 

2704
01:57:14,961 --> 01:57:14,961
normally do.

2705
01:57:14,961 --> 01:57:14,961
If better damn work.
Because you don't,

2706
01:57:14,961 --> 01:57:19,460
you can't get,
just go to the store to get another 10 

2707
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:19,460
line,
right?

2708
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:19,460
Like you can get another chicken,
you can't get another,

2709
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:23,771
the tenderloin,
so you may tenderloin from a moose or 

2710
01:57:23,771 --> 01:57:26,810
from a prior.
And so everything has to be airtight and

2711
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:31,820
in and tested.
Will any of these recipes work with 

2712
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:32,520
domestic animals?
Like if somebody is really curious about

2713
01:57:32,521 --> 01:57:33,210
it?
Sure.

2714
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,130
Uh,
how would you know how to substitute?

2715
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:40,310
I would say a bison or grassfed beef 
will get you pretty close and flavor and

2716
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:43,050
a lamb or goat will get you pretty close
in size.

2717
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:46,620
No lamb doesn't taste like medicine,
but in terms of size,

2718
01:57:46,621 --> 01:57:50,880
like a shank recipe for example,
or a shoulder recipe or a neck recipe.

2719
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:56,150
Land would be a perfect substitute.
But if you want to get close to what a 

2720
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:58,020
good deer or an elk tastes like,
grass fed beef or bison.

2721
01:57:58,350 --> 01:58:00,420
And when people do buy commercially 
available,

2722
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:03,990
venison and elk,
doesn't it all come from other countries

2723
01:58:03,991 --> 01:58:05,520
as a come from New Zealand?
Most of it,

2724
01:58:05,521 --> 01:58:08,340
at least most of them,
most of whatever it is that you will see

2725
01:58:08,341 --> 01:58:10,920
that called Venison will be red stag 
from New Zealand,

2726
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
but there are elk farms in the United 
States that I've seen how commercially 

2727
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,601
for sale,
really Marshall Elk growing in the 

2728
01:58:20,601 --> 01:58:20,601
United States.
That seems wrong.

2729
01:58:20,601 --> 01:58:22,440
You might say that,
but I couldn't possibly comment.

2730
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:27,510
Does that seem a little.
But that's one of the weird things about

2731
01:58:27,511 --> 01:58:29,670
wild game is that you can't sell it.
Right?

2732
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:35,120
I mean that's one of the really 
appealing things about because they 

2733
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:35,120
belonged to all of us.
Yeah.

2734
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:35,120
Yeah.
What's.

2735
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:40,190
Well,
it's also the market hunting is what 

2736
01:58:40,190 --> 01:58:40,570
wiped them out at the turn of the 
century and the,

2737
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:43,780
you know,
even as late as the 19 fifties,

2738
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:47,040
it was a news item for somebody to get 
an eight point.

2739
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:51,190
Wow.
I know guys who an eight point buck what

2740
01:58:51,191 --> 01:58:53,830
he's talking about the yellers because 
there there were almost wiped out.

2741
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:58,980
Yeah.
I mean it was a news event even in the 

2742
01:58:58,980 --> 01:58:58,980
sixties in some places.
So it's like these are the good old days

2743
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:00,000
of deer hunting.
Yeah.

2744
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:01,360
Yeah.
Well,

2745
01:59:01,361 --> 01:59:02,770
when I was in Iowa,
we saw a lot of,

2746
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,720
we didn't see any big deer that got 
close,

2747
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:05,710
but we saw like,
wow,

2748
01:59:05,711 --> 01:59:06,640
like,
this is crazy.

2749
01:59:06,641 --> 01:59:07,450
There's,
they're here.

2750
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:11,920
The biggest white tell ever saw was this
giant in western Kansas when I was quail

2751
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:14,050
hunting as this is supposed to be Mecca.
Right.

2752
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:15,310
It's a mecca.
I mean,

2753
01:59:15,311 --> 01:59:16,630
Kansas,
Iowa,

2754
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:18,820
you know,
in Kansas for big,

2755
01:59:18,821 --> 01:59:20,470
giant white tails.
Yeah,

2756
01:59:20,471 --> 01:59:25,471
I know people that moved there.
My friend John Dudley moved there just 

2757
01:59:25,471 --> 01:59:25,471
because just because of the deer 
hunting,

2758
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:27,490
he's an archer and there's a little 
obsessive,

2759
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:29,560
little crazy,
a little crazy.

2760
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,220
Um,
do you have a,

2761
01:59:31,221 --> 01:59:32,280
a favorite?
Me.

2762
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:36,380
I'm a mammal that you like to cook.
Eno.

2763
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:43,060
Okay.
But the first thing that popped in my 

2764
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:44,431
head and was heavily ina have Alina,
and I think it's because I'm a fan of 

2765
01:59:44,431 --> 01:59:48,850
the underdog a.
So I shot a couple of skunk pigs.

2766
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:50,750
I'm so heavily in columns,
gunk,

2767
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:52,780
pig.
It's not really a pig,

2768
01:59:52,781 --> 01:59:53,310
right?
Well,

2769
01:59:53,311 --> 01:59:53,950
it's,
it isn't,

2770
01:59:53,951 --> 01:59:55,060
but it isn't.
It's a peccary.

2771
01:59:55,170 --> 02:00:00,170
Um,
and it's native to the United States 

2772
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:00,170
where pigs are not.
And they look like pigs,

2773
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:04,891
they act like pigs,
they are related to pigs on the family 

2774
02:00:04,891 --> 02:00:04,891
tree,
but they're not,

2775
02:00:04,891 --> 02:00:07,770
they're not that close and there is no 
reason why people should hate heavily 

2776
02:00:08,741 --> 02:00:13,741
now.
So like if you go to Arizona or New 

2777
02:00:13,741 --> 02:00:13,741
Mexico,
everybody loves how heavily,

2778
02:00:13,741 --> 02:00:16,060
like he was to eat and he'd go only to 
South Texas.

2779
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:17,450
There you go,
creepy fucker.

2780
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:19,660
If you go to south Texas,
they're like,

2781
02:00:19,690 --> 02:00:24,690
ah,
they're disgusting over the rats or 

2782
02:00:24,690 --> 02:00:26,521
whatever.
And so I was in south Texas and I said 

2783
02:00:26,521 --> 02:00:26,521
to the landowner,
I was weighing like,

2784
02:00:26,521 --> 02:00:27,580
let me,
let me show you a couple of like a.

2785
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:33,420
So I cleaned up because I was,
I was wondering about this mysterious 

2786
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:36,431
thing,
clan that you're not supposed to break 

2787
02:00:36,431 --> 02:00:36,431
up,
which is the smaller back.

2788
02:00:36,431 --> 02:00:36,431
It's like,
you know,

2789
02:00:36,431 --> 02:00:36,431
it's kind of like a heavily in a tramp 
stamp.

2790
02:00:37,330 --> 02:00:39,840
And,
and so if you,

2791
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:42,310
if you skin the animal,
like you would scan a pig,

2792
02:00:42,490 --> 02:00:45,130
you never see it.
It's in the skin.

2793
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:47,470
So if you come underneath the skin 
you'll never nick it,

2794
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:50,530
you'll have no problem.
And it's just like a little teeny pig.

2795
02:00:50,650 --> 02:00:53,170
And they taste fantastic.
They're really.

2796
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:56,010
There is no off taste to them at all.
Describe it.

2797
02:00:56,011 --> 02:00:58,540
Was it pork pig like big,
like,

2798
02:00:58,780 --> 02:00:59,380
like,
no.

2799
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:03,070
More like pork pork.
Then wild boar is really.

2800
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:05,140
Yeah,
they're there because they're almost,

2801
02:01:05,530 --> 02:01:07,600
I don't know if they're obligate 
vegetarians,

2802
02:01:07,601 --> 02:01:12,601
but they're primarily vegetarians.
I know my friend Doug Stan Hope told me 

2803
02:01:12,601 --> 02:01:16,430
that one killed his neighbor's dog.
Fucking they surrounded the dog and mold

2804
02:01:16,431 --> 02:01:17,500
it.
Well that's good.

2805
02:01:17,530 --> 02:01:19,390
Have you ever seen heavily to teeth?
Yeah,

2806
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:22,480
the big ass crazy spikes.
They actually like spikes were,

2807
02:01:22,481 --> 02:01:27,481
were uh,
were wild boars have like a arcs like 

2808
02:01:27,481 --> 02:01:27,481
comes.
They will.

2809
02:01:27,481 --> 02:01:28,760
They hunted this thing like the,
they killed it on purpose.

2810
02:01:28,761 --> 02:01:30,220
Look,
you're that fucking creepy bastard.

2811
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:32,500
Jesus Christ.
Roar.

2812
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:35,230
Ferocious looking weird.
Hobbit,

2813
02:01:35,231 --> 02:01:38,110
animal hobbit tag.
That doesn't want a real animal.

2814
02:01:38,111 --> 02:01:43,111
Right?
It looks like something from a movie 

2815
02:01:43,111 --> 02:01:43,111
like Lord

2816
02:01:43,111 --> 02:01:43,111
of the rings movie.

2817
02:01:43,111 --> 02:01:43,111
But you know,
that said,

2818
02:01:43,111 --> 02:01:43,111
um,
I just,

2819
02:01:43,111 --> 02:01:44,340
um,
I like it.

2820
02:01:44,341 --> 02:01:49,341
I,
I love cooking them because they're fun 

2821
02:01:49,341 --> 02:01:51,051
and I like pork.
And you prepare it the same way you 

2822
02:01:51,051 --> 02:01:53,481
would cook or the pork loin or.
I tend to go a lot of Mexican Central 

2823
02:01:53,481 --> 02:01:56,811
American recipes because that's where 
they live and in desert southwest kind 

2824
02:01:57,271 --> 02:01:58,080
of stuff.
But you know,

2825
02:01:58,270 --> 02:01:58,860
took.
Get me wrong.

2826
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:04,100
I love Angela.
Probably pronghorn antelope wouldn't be 

2827
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:04,100
my second.
I've heard this delicious save.

2828
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:05,640
You'll hear it's delicious in your hair.
It's disgusting.

2829
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:08,490
And here's why.
Because pronghorns are,

2830
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:11,880
they're super nervous animals that are 
like high strong,

2831
02:02:11,881 --> 02:02:13,500
dear basically,
even though they're out of here,

2832
02:02:13,730 --> 02:02:16,280
I'm pseudo capra something or other.
That's their,

2833
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:17,940
that's their genus.
They're their own thing.

2834
02:02:18,870 --> 02:02:23,870
Weird side note there so fast because 
they were evolved to run away from the 

2835
02:02:24,781 --> 02:02:27,600
Cheetah,
this blue mind.

2836
02:02:27,810 --> 02:02:32,810
So the Cheetah in Africa was actually a 
Cheetah and the American Great Plains 

2837
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:35,970
before the ice age,
it migrated back over the land bridge.

2838
02:02:36,690 --> 02:02:41,690
It got itself into Asia and Africa.
So the Cheetah that exists now is our 

2839
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:45,651
Cheetah,
said our cheetah died out in the ice 

2840
02:02:45,651 --> 02:02:45,651
age.
In the end,

2841
02:02:45,651 --> 02:02:49,371
the pronghorn antelope did not.
So the antelope is essentially waiting 

2842
02:02:49,371 --> 02:02:50,070
for the Cheetah.
Nothing can catch it.

2843
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:52,110
The other so fast.
Nothing can catch it.

2844
02:02:52,140 --> 02:02:53,310
People call them speed.
Goats,

2845
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:54,310
goats.
Yeah.

2846
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:56,610
And so they're super nervous and they 
die really easy.

2847
02:02:56,611 --> 02:02:57,350
Usually it's like,
wow,

2848
02:02:57,351 --> 02:02:58,350
I'm dead.
And they fall over.

2849
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:03,680
And uh,
and so you go with what you do is you go

2850
02:03:03,781 --> 02:03:04,680
up,
you take your little shot,

2851
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:07,890
Yay.
And then got him right there,

2852
02:03:08,430 --> 02:03:12,120
throw the wobbly bits in a bag and throw
it a cooler and get them out of the skin

2853
02:03:12,121 --> 02:03:14,520
as fast as possible.
If you do those two things,

2854
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:17,820
it's some of the best events and you'll 
see why do you have to get it out of the

2855
02:03:17,821 --> 02:03:18,500
skin as fast ball?

2856
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:22,320
Because they burn hot body temperature 
is hotter than a deer in there.

2857
02:03:22,321 --> 02:03:26,130
Hide holds heat better than a deer.
So those two things,

2858
02:03:26,131 --> 02:03:27,840
plus the fact that they're super nervous
like this,

2859
02:03:28,290 --> 02:03:33,290
they can go off in a hurry.
So what you see a lot of guys do is 

2860
02:03:33,290 --> 02:03:36,720
let's say you and me and steve were 
hunting antelope and you know,

2861
02:03:36,750 --> 02:03:40,210
I shot mine first thing in the morning 
and you shot yours,

2862
02:03:40,270 --> 02:03:42,570
meaning an hour or two later.
But Steve can't buy a shot,

2863
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:45,810
which is probably not how it would work.
But for the sake of the story,

2864
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:49,080
so let's say steve finally gets one at 
like 3:00

2865
02:03:49,081 --> 02:03:50,220
in the afternoon.
Yay.

2866
02:03:50,970 --> 02:03:53,400
Then we would start getting them.
That's,

2867
02:03:53,610 --> 02:03:57,450
you see that happen a lot and our,
our analysts will be ruined.

2868
02:03:57,451 --> 02:03:58,080
His will be fine.

2869
02:03:58,650 --> 02:03:59,790
Oh,
let's see.

2870
02:03:59,791 --> 02:04:04,791
So you just got to jump on it right away
and get it to a cooler as quickly as 

2871
02:04:04,791 --> 02:04:04,800
possible.
You often hunt antelope and warm weather

2872
02:04:04,801 --> 02:04:05,870
to very hot,
right?

2873
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:08,970
Like New Mexico in the summer,
late August,

2874
02:04:08,971 --> 02:04:11,760
September.
So it's like many things we were talking

2875
02:04:11,761 --> 02:04:16,761
about gaming ness.
It's just a preparation and an 

2876
02:04:16,761 --> 02:04:18,921
understanding of what,
what you are required to do in order to 

2877
02:04:18,921 --> 02:04:19,200
make sure that this meat is edible.
Exactly.

2878
02:04:19,230 --> 02:04:21,030
In tastes good.
Um,

2879
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:22,260
there's,
there's,

2880
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:26,100
there's a bunch of animals that people.
You've got to get out of here soon.

2881
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:27,900
Soon.
We'll wrap this up.

2882
02:04:28,050 --> 02:04:31,350
We can wrap this up there.
There's a bunch of animals that,

2883
02:04:31,351 --> 02:04:32,520
uh,
I think,

2884
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:37,560
uh,
have no equivalent in domestic food,

2885
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:43,370
right?
Like what would you say if you've 

2886
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:44,850
wanted,
if you were trying to coach someone into

2887
02:04:44,890 --> 02:04:47,700
a trying wild game or being interested 
in wild game,

2888
02:04:47,701 --> 02:04:50,430
what do you think would be one that you 
would start them off with?

2889
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:53,420
Something that's familiar.
So duck.

2890
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:58,550
I'm venison backstrap.
Anything with wild boar because it's 

2891
02:04:58,550 --> 02:05:00,390
basically if you had to pick a,
an a recipe out of this.

2892
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:04,020
Oh,
this one I would do just a simple seared

2893
02:05:04,021 --> 02:05:07,350
backstrap with like a cumberland sauce 
or a or steak.

2894
02:05:07,351 --> 02:05:09,010
Diane steak.
Diane.

2895
02:05:09,210 --> 02:05:12,240
Diane.
Diane is a,

2896
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:15,960
it's a 150 year old recipe.
That's a classic for a reason.

2897
02:05:15,961 --> 02:05:17,680
It's,
it's back.

2898
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:20,430
It's Diane is for Diana,
the goddess of the hunt.

2899
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:25,610
So originally in France it was a,
it was venison for recipe and it became 

2900
02:05:25,610 --> 02:05:29,241
a beef recipe later and it is a recipe 
with cognac or brandy,

2901
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:31,290
a little bit of mustard,
a little bit of cream.

2902
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:34,120
The drippings from the pants that.
Yup.

2903
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:35,880
Good Lord.
That looks good.

2904
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:38,880
And uh,
and at that actually my recipe,

2905
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:41,910
I did that.
I did that on simply recipes.

2906
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:44,190
Oh Nice.
And so it's a,

2907
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:48,750
it's a million years old.
And it is amazing.

2908
02:05:48,751 --> 02:05:53,751
There's not,
I don't think I've ever encountered 

2909
02:05:53,751 --> 02:05:53,970
anybody who has made my recipe for it 
who didn't like it.

2910
02:05:54,110 --> 02:05:55,590
Goddammit.
I want to cook that tonight.

2911
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,600
It's easy too.
That's the other thing.

2912
02:05:57,601 --> 02:05:59,730
It's like,
it feels sort of chefy and date 90,

2913
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:01,770
but it's it,
it's the 30 minute meal.

2914
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:03,780
Wow.
That's awesome.

2915
02:06:03,810 --> 02:06:05,160
Well listen man,
your books.

2916
02:06:05,161 --> 02:06:07,920
Awesome.
I've enjoyed a lot of your videos.

2917
02:06:07,921 --> 02:06:12,921
I've enjoyed you on television before as
a pleasure to have you on and get to 

2918
02:06:12,921 --> 02:06:14,820
talk food and the origins and everything
with you.

2919
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:15,650
And uh,
I heard,

2920
02:06:15,950 --> 02:06:17,640
I like are nonlinear conversation.
It's great.

2921
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:19,250
It was fine.
That's all my goal.

2922
02:06:19,251 --> 02:06:22,110
That way I,
I urge people to go out if you're a,

2923
02:06:22,111 --> 02:06:25,230
if you're a hunter or if you're just a 
fan of delicious food,

2924
02:06:25,231 --> 02:06:30,231
go out and check this out.
Buck Buck Moose by Hank shot and you 

2925
02:06:30,231 --> 02:06:30,470
have other books available,
right with the other books.

2926
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:33,560
My last one is duck duck goose,
which as you might guess is what bell or

2927
02:06:33,570 --> 02:06:38,570
found silly goose.
And then my first one is called Hunter 

2928
02:06:38,570 --> 02:06:38,570
Gatherer Cook.
Okay.

2929
02:06:38,570 --> 02:06:42,560
And you are a hunt.
Gather Cook on twitter and same on 

2930
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:42,560
instagram.
Yep.

2931
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,070
And do you have a facebook as well?
I do.

2932
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:45,900
And it's a hunter angler.
Gardiner.

2933
02:06:45,901 --> 02:06:47,040
Okay.
Thank you brother.

2934
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:49,140
This was really fun.
I really appreciate you coming on.

2935
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:50,820
Absolutely.
Thanks everybody.

2936
02:06:50,821 --> 02:06:53,370
We'll be back tomorrow with James 
Hetfield from metallica.
