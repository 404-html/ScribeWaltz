1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,203
Donta.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,630
Uh,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,260
and we're back.
What's up buddy

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,990
tan really and joined the southern
California weather,

5
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,930
sir,
my biggest problem everyday is to decide

6
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,470
which beach between La and San Diego to
hit.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,860
Would you bragging,
bragging about your lacks problems?

8
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,690
My privileged life,
you're brown privilege,

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,340
like Brown privilege.
It's like a bronze.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,570
It's a very bronze shine.
In a few days it'll settle in and that's

11
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,890
when the true glory of God comes up.
Ah,

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,490
I bet your,
your vitamin D levels are at an all time

13
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:42,000
high.
I need to take them in for the Montreal

14
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:42,540
winters.
Right.

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,880
Do you supplement and when you were in
the winter in Montreal,

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,250
you don't died a hundred percent vitamin
D's.

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,020
It's a critical factor or I'd just come
back to do your show in the winter and

18
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:54,030
then that's how I got myself.
I don't think that's enough.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,510
I need that vitamin D,
that's a big thing with the,

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,810
apparently with people that live in
Seattle in the winter is taking vitamin

21
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,640
D and even sun tanning beds.

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,950
People don't realize it's sun tanning
beds,

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,620
although it's kind of counterintuitive.
You think they're really bad for you?

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,830
It's actually not that bad for you.
As long as you don't burn yourself.

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,110
It's actually good.
I did a study a while,

26
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:14,160
a paper,
I wrote it.

27
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:17,760
This was a theoretical paper with a
dermatologist a few years ago where we

28
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:22,761
looked at some evolutionary explanations
for the epidemiology of suntanning.

29
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,430
So if I were to ask her,
not without you knowing anything about

30
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,020
it or not much about evolutionary
theory,

31
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,010
who do you,
what's the typical demographic of the

32
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,080
sort of obsessive Santana [inaudible]
what?

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
Well women,
young,

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,390
bright,
single.

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,590
And they usually tend to discount the
future consequences for the immediate

36
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:44,340
benefits.
Right?

37
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,900
Right.
So the smoking cigarettes,

38
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,190
they probably smoke.
Exactly.

39
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,480
So it doesn't matter whether I'll get my
window when I'm 73 I'm going tonight to

40
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:53,390
the Party and Tony might be there and
I'd like to,

41
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,710
and so we,
so,

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,170
so with this,
this dermatologist friend of mine had

43
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:59,970
written to me,
he was doing his fellowship and he said,

44
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:00,480
look,
I've got,

45
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,580
as part of my research requirements,
I'd have to write a paper,

46
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,200
can I,
you know,

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,140
you're the big researcher.

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,670
Can I do a paper with you?
I said,

49
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,410
but you're a dermatologist.
What can we talk about?

50
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,580
And then I thought,
well,

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,810
let's do the evolutionary roots of
suntanning and there.

52
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,850
And that's how that paper came to be is
how was that evolutionary though?

53
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,030
What's evolutionary about white girls
that don't think about the future?

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,961
Well,
no,

55
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,794
it's,
it's,

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,510
are there particular ways that we can
predict the demographics of people who

57
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,160
do certain behaviors?
So for example,

58
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,760
pathological gambling.
Who Do you think is likely to succumb to

59
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:33,120
that affliction?
Pathological gambling.

60
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:34,260
I would say,
uh,

61
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,330
men are with men,
adult men in their thirties.

62
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,840
Low status,
low status on average.

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,440
Okay.
And the reason is because it's,

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,730
it's,
it's one of a multitude of strategies to

65
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:49,020
acquire resources,
right?

66
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,390
It's the same reason that men,
rob banks,

67
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:52,830
not women.
And so you could,

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,233
okay,
let's do another one.

69
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,090
Eating disorders.
Who Do you think it's,

70
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,730
it comes to eating disorders?
More anorexia Nervosa in particular.

71
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,080
Okay.
Women limit.

72
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,880
Now typically the social science
explanation is old,

73
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:09,340
just due to exposure to media images,
right at that turns out to be a

74
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,620
laughably false premise.
Why is it laughable?

75
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,300
So here we go.
Here's the evolutionary angle.

76
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,790
Okay.
Hippocrates,

77
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,880
founder of modern medicine 2000 plus
years ago had documented the exact same

78
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,820
epidemiology of eating disorder
disorders in women.

79
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,560
So it certainly can't be because of
media,

80
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,310
right?
So there,

81
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,310
there must be something biological that
explains the sex specificity of these

82
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:34,090
different,
uh,

83
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,590
you know,
dark side consumption.

84
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,630
And so the evolutionary perspective is
to then look at to the extent that these

85
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:45,631
human universals manifest themselves in
exactly the same way across time and

86
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,460
place.
What might be some of these biological

87
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,190
drivers,
compulsive buying almost exclusively

88
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,450
women,
90% women,

89
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,940
uh,
pornographic addictions,

90
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,190
almost exclusively male.

91
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,800
And let's just stick with this one.
Let's just stick with this one.

92
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,190
The anorexia Nervosa.
First of all,

93
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,620
when you're talking about hippocrates,
you're talking about one lone

94
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,900
individual,
so completely anecdotal piece of

95
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:12,901
evidence and he said that women were
throwing up at a status symbol back then

96
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,880
for women to be overweight.
So it actually,

97
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:16,714
it's,
it's a good question.

98
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,690
Uh,
eating disorders are much more likely to

99
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,720
occur in cultures of plenty,
right?

100
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,870
Precisely.
Because the argument is that you can

101
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,780
shut off your reproductive window today
because when,

102
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,920
what happens when you,
so here's the evolutionary angle.

103
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,310
When you,
when you suffer from eating disorder,

104
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,980
the first thing that happens
physiologically is you get what's called

105
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:39,010
[inaudible] Arabia.
Primary Laminaria is where you haven't

106
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:41,260
had your mentees yet and now they don't
come out.

107
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,410
They don't,
there's no onsite and recycle.

108
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,280
Yeah.
Did you say menzies?

109
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:45,940
Your mentees?

110
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,691
Yeah.
Is that,

111
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:48,440
is that like the technical term for it?
It's the,

112
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,680
it's the fancy term for it.
Yeah.

113
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,490
MNCS,
everyone said it sounds like something a

114
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,130
little kid would call it mommy,
I didn't get my mentees.

115
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,690
Well,
uh,

116
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,130
now secondary amenorrhea is where you
already had your menstrual cycle and

117
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:03,460
then it's shut off once you become,
once you have anorexia Nervosa.

118
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,570
Okay.
Well what happens when you have an

119
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,590
erection when you have avenue area is
that you,

120
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,420
you know,
your,

121
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,440
your reproductive potential shut off.
Right?

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,920
And so what evolutionary scientists have
found is that it turns out that when

123
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:19,150
women suffer from Anorexia Nervosa,
there is some environmental trigger that

124
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:23,950
they're being exposed to Co.
Rightly so or wrongly so that they think

125
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,670
they should shut off their mentees.
They reproductive potential for a better

126
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:29,110
future.
You can see what I'm saying.

127
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,220
Whoa.
So,

128
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,771
and,
and let me,

129
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:31,870
let me give you the background to this.

130
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,450
There's a model called the reproductive
suppression model,

131
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:37,180
found an other mammalian species that's
say a cow.

132
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,980
Okay.
So if you take a cow,

133
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,340
what would be the biggest environmental
threat that it faces other than

134
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,280
predators?
What would you think about tainted water

135
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:47,770
or food or just how much food she can
have?

136
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,320
Right.
Cause she had access to enough calories

137
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,690
to sustain her gestational period.
Right.

138
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,870
Well it turns out that in in Mammalian
species,

139
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,080
a wide range of movie alien species.
Somehow there was a mechanism in

140
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:03,770
evolutionary mechanism that either
causes the females of the species to

141
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:07,790
either shut off they reproductive window
or if they're already pregnant.

142
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,280
And then there's an environmental input
that says,

143
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,540
Hey,
this is not looking good.

144
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,640
What do you think happens to their body?
What did they do with the video board?

145
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,990
The fetus,
they abort the fetus.

146
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,160
And now postnatally you have
infanticide.

147
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,570
So in this case you have the child,
but you realize for whatever

148
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:27,650
environmental reason that it's not going
to be fruitful to raise that child and

149
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,320
you buy where you fall.
You see it in human cultures where

150
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:34,340
typically the one who was killed as the
last born as you would expect because

151
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,740
the other children now you've invested
quite a bit in them.

152
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,880
And so if you're going to get rid of
some of your genetic package,

153
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,720
you get rid of the one that you've
invested Leeson.

154
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,220
So all of these mechanisms that are part
of something called the reproductive

155
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:49,910
suppression model,
the idea is that eating disorders is a

156
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:53,510
special instanciation of that because
what the eating disorder is doing,

157
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,080
it's shutting off your reproductive
potential because you're getting

158
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,820
amenorrhea,
right?

159
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,110
But is that absolutely connected to why
women get anorexic?

160
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:07,430
Because it could easily be just a side
effect of them wanting to be

161
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,380
ridiculously skinny like it.

162
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,880
Like I would understand with a cow,
with something that's living in a very

163
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,980
wild life,
a wild world,

164
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,620
you know,
this animal out there just eating grass

165
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:21,740
and when resources are depleted,
like nature kicks in.

166
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,570
But,
but there's no conscious decision making

167
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:26,450
process when a woman is deciding to be
anorexic.

168
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,900
At least there's some form of decision
making process that wants her to lean

169
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:37,190
towards a slimmer physique.
So that speaks to a very interesting

170
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,890
distinction.
And so bear with me as I set it up.

171
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,140
Okay.
There's something in evolutionary theory

172
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:45,080
known as proximate versus ultimate
explanations,

173
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,870
proximity.
And actually that speaks to the article

174
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:49,580
that I had sent you.
That's one of the points that I

175
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,280
discussed in that article.
Proximate explanations and science.

176
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,150
Explain the how and the what of
something much of science operates at

177
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:59,750
the approximate level.
If you want to explain what diabetes is

178
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:01,370
exactly,
physiologically speaking,

179
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,320
you'll explain it at the approximate
level.

180
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,770
The ultimate explanation is the
Darwinian why,

181
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,950
why would something have evolved to be
of that form?

182
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,970
So let's discuss it in relation to
something related to eating disorders.

183
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:15,440
Pregnancies taken us,
right?

184
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,550
So pregnancy sickness is a phenomenon
that women experience around the world.

185
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,830
That's a universal phenomenon found in
all cultures.

186
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,350
Uh,
approximate explanation might be,

187
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:29,180
or approximately exploration might be,
how do shifts in a woman's,

188
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,540
uh,
estrogen levels affect the severity of

189
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,790
her symptoms?
That's approximate question.

190
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,270
The ultimate question is why have women
evolved that physiological response

191
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,280
before I give the answer?
Can you guess what that might be?

192
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,370
Why do they develop that ultimate
response?

193
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,350
So why is it that women experience Prek?
The,

194
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,390
I call it pregnancy sickness,
but I mean the typical colloquial term

195
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:56,580
is morning sickness,
but some women don't experience it in

196
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:58,020
the morning.
I have no idea why.

197
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,130
Tell me why you ready.

198
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,700
Yeah.
So pregnancy sickness happens during the

199
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,760
first trimester of gestation during a
period called organogenesis.

200
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,810
This is when the fetus is developing its
main organs during that particular

201
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,660
period.
It's particularly important that the

202
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:20,661
women not be exposed to food pathogens
teratogens that might harm the

203
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:25,560
developmental pathway of the fetus is
organs.

204
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,200
Therefore,
all of the mechanisms that she

205
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:31,590
experiences attraction to certain foods,
pickles,

206
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,930
up,
repulsion from other foods.

207
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,290
Uh,
the feeling of feeling,

208
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,711
uh,
you know,

209
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,330
being nauseous,
the throwing up,

210
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,100
all of those built in mechanisms are
evolved mechanisms that are meant to

211
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:49,101
protect possibly the fetus from being
exposed to teratogens and it's perfectly

212
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:54,201
timed so that once organogenesis ends,
that's when the pregnancy sips symptoms.

213
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,510
And so the difference between proximate
and ultimate,

214
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:00,540
it's not that one is a better
explanation than the other is that you

215
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,980
need both levels of explanations to
perfectly understand something.

216
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,690
Well that makes total sense,
but it doesn't necessarily apply to why

217
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:14,520
women become anorexic because the desire
to be slim,

218
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,550
to look very thin in public is very
strong because of social media or media

219
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,420
rather.
Uh,

220
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,360
the depictions of women,
they're always almost impossibly slam.

221
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:26,670
And then on top of that,
they also had photoshop to it.

222
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,320
Right.
So in the,

223
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,600
in the,
the evolutionary explanation to the

224
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:35,460
eating disorder story is there is
something in the environment that the

225
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:39,750
woman in question is thinking is a
threat to her.

226
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,710
Could you think the same thing as the
cow felt for the lack of calories?

227
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,920
Can you think in the human context?
What might be such a threat?

228
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,460
Do you see what I'm saying?
So what?

229
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,210
I don't know.
What would be such a salt,

230
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:53,430
for example,
if you feel rightly or wrongly,

231
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:53,940
right?
It doesn't.

232
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,830
It doesn't matter whether they
objectively it's true or not.

233
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,660
Whatever she feels is what the reality
is,

234
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:00,450
right?
If she feels that there isn't going to

235
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,870
be sufficient either can support,
extended,

236
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:08,010
can support when she raises the child or
the most likely thing is partner

237
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:10,530
support.
If she feels that there isn't likely to

238
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:14,520
be a good partner who's going to support
her since we are by parental species,

239
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,830
then she engages at and shutting down
her reproductive window.

240
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,570
Hence what you said is true at the
proximate level,

241
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,570
right?
Her thinking can become this disordered

242
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,750
so that she actually looks at herself in
the mirror even though she's only 70

243
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:32,970
pounds and she still thinks that she's
fat,

244
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,960
but that's approximate explanation.
But the explanation that I've given you

245
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:40,320
is the ultimate Darwinian white.
Together they make a full,

246
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,630
complete explanation of the phenomenon.
So it doesn't occur in people that have

247
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:50,631
very healthy relationships with a spouse
or it occurs much more rarely.

248
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,260
Much more rare.
Exactly.

249
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,910
So the research shows,
the evolutionary research shows that the

250
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:59,911
environmental threats equivalent to
lacking of grazing area for the cow is

251
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:05,380
lack of extended,
can support or made support to the

252
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:07,030
woman.
Does that makes sense?

253
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,270
That makes sense.
Because it is primarily single women,

254
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,510
right?
That they'd have anorexia and that's

255
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:14,350
why,
by the way,

256
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:18,880
you see it in cultures of plenti rather
than an Ethiopia because you would

257
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:23,140
expect that the woman who shuts off her
reproductive potential today,

258
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,490
it's because she's hoping that in some
future state things will be better for

259
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,350
her to get back on the reproductive
train.

260
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,220
When you're in Ethiopia.
I don't have a chance to shut off my

261
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,680
reproductive potential.
I need to get the food tomorrow,

262
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:37,360
I'm going to die.
Right.

263
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,830
Wow.
Interesting.

264
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,250
But that still doesn't cover is
hippocrates.

265
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,980
Hippocrates is just one guy who,
right.

266
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,210
Who had a sufficient database at the
time to,

267
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,050
uh,
describe the findings in very similar

268
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:56,620
farms to the current ones.
What I'm saying basically is that if

269
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,680
it's were that it's due to media images
then well he didn't have media and it

270
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,401
just at that time.
Right.

271
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,440
I mean so how would it be that an
ancient Greece,

272
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,440
it is also the case that is only women
who experienced an erection or votes.

273
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,940
What did he describe?
What was he talking about?

274
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,080
I mean the specifics,
I don't know.

275
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:15,910
So I haven't read the,
the original,

276
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,170
it's kind of managing,
I don't know.

277
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,700
I mean cause I'm just aren't like
ancient depictions of women.

278
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,710
Like it's desirable for them to be
overweight.

279
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,210
Right.
It depends on the culture.

280
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:29,680
I mean the usual universal that we
typically talk of in terms of body types

281
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,220
is that it'd be an hourglass figure,
which actually is going to speak to the

282
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:33,820
second point.

283
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
That other paper that I send you,
so an evolutionary theory.

284
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,990
What we do typically is we build what
are called neurological networks of

285
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,220
cumulative evidence.
In other words,

286
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,050
when you're trying to make an
evolutionary argument,

287
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,470
it's you don't just come up with a post
hoc story as some people who don't

288
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:49,570
understand evolutionary theory like to
say that,

289
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:52,000
oh,
we just concoct these post hoc

290
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,520
speculative evolutionary stories.
As a matter of fact,

291
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,010
the evidentiary threshold that
evolutionists typically seek to achieve

292
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,800
is actually very high.
So let's take the hourglass figure for

293
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,634
example.
Okay,

294
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,090
so what is some data that would convince
people that men have evolved the pension

295
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,340
for the hourglass figure?
So let's go through some of these.

296
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,540
You Ready?
Okay.

297
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,750
What is some data?
Yeah.

298
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,660
So in other words,
if I wanted to convince you

299
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,690
unequivocally of the adaptive argument,
the evolutionary argument as to why men

300
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,560
might prefer the hourglass figure so
that they should have bigger hips,

301
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:31,420
it would make it easier for her to breed
larger fat deposits in the breasts in

302
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:31,960
the ass.

303
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,540
It makes it healthier.
She has fat storing for she's,

304
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,120
she'll have healthy offspring.
Okay,

305
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:40,960
so let me jump in.
So if you had medical and reproductive

306
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:45,280
data that shows that women who have that
particular body type are more likely to

307
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:47,980
conceive,
then that would be one check and we have

308
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:48,520
it.
Yeah.

309
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,310
Then we might look for human universals
of that preference.

310
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:55,400
In other words,
we don't simply use data from Ucla

311
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:58,280
undergrads to tell us what types of body
types would prefer.

312
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,610
We go to the animal,
more tribe in the Amazon and ask them

313
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:03,560
what type of body types they prefer and
so on.

314
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,950
So if you then demonstrate the
universality of that preference,

315
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,400
that's another check.
Now we could look at art data.

316
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:13,060
You,
you pointed to some of the depictions so

317
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,310
we can ask Ruben.
We can look at data from ancient Greece,

318
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,910
from ancient Egypt,
the pharaohs and so on from Africa,

319
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:22,670
from India,
and we could take the statues from those

320
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,660
cultures spanning several thousand years
and do a content analysis of the statues

321
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:29,510
and show that they,
they come very close to that hourglass

322
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,510
figure we could take,
if that's not enough data,

323
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,220
this one's going to clinch it for you.

324
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,320
But there's many others that I could
give you.

325
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,740
You could take congenitally blind men,
these are men who have never had the

326
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:45,050
gift of sight.
And you could show haptically through

327
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:49,580
touch that they prefer women that have
the hourglass figure,

328
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,160
which,
which immediately negates the

329
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:56,600
possibility that it's due to the fact
that they were taught those preferences

330
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,040
through the media.
And so you systematically collect data

331
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,780
from multiple converging lines of
evidence where that that data becomes

332
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,540
overwhelming,
it becomes unassailable.

333
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,700
And that's how you built an adaptive
argument.

334
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,860
So contrary to all the guys who say,
oh,

335
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,560
evolution has just come up with these
cute post-hoc stories,

336
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,670
we're actually profoundly more
meticulous and a situation.

337
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,730
And the data that we collect well is
that really been established that so

338
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:28,550
many men prefer soft,
mushy,

339
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,330
hourglass type figures is deposed too
hard bodied women?

340
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,880
How many women are you letting these
blind guys grope?

341
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,290
It's like,
are they getting a real study sample to

342
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,330
choose from or like how's that?
I like it.

343
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,200
Good.
We got it.

344
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,430
Well,
the p the,

345
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,830
the particular data with the congenital
blind men,

346
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:48,230
I think they only had maybe two or three
mannequins.

347
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,410
Mannequins.
Wait a minute.

348
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,660
Okay.
So you're letting them feel up

349
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:55,490
mannequins.
So all the day that I gave you is not

350
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:56,990
enough.
Now you're going to attack me mannequin

351
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:57,650
style.
He got it.

352
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,251
Okay.
How about,

353
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,840
can't you bring up strippers?
I mean,

354
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,320
how do you,
why do you have to have a mannequin?

355
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,270
Well,
because probably it might be difficult

356
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,910
to have the,
uh,

357
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,280
ethics approval board of universities
have young,

358
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,210
a young blind men or maybe they're not
young feel off a bunch of women.

359
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,550
Yes.
The ethics board doesn't like science

360
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,880
because you can't just judge what a guy
likes and women by you letting them

361
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,160
touch a doll,
that's ridiculous.

362
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,080
But let's shit science.
Okay,

363
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:29,081
well isn't that look every,
every study has some methodological

364
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:31,004
constraints,
right?

365
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,710
That one's easy to fix by having real
women being fest.

366
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,070
I'm sure a lot of women would sign up
for that.

367
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,061
Okay,
well maybe.

368
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:40,040
Maybe.
Why didn't they try that?

369
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,770
That seems so that you can tell by the
way that I'm not misspeaking.

370
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,350
I hope that they did use mannequins and
let's find out what's the name of the

371
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:48,440
study at Jimmy.
We'll look at the 2010 he just do

372
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:52,230
congenital blind men and waist to hip
ratios and it'll come up.

373
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:54,390
It'll come up on the Jamie Board of
truth,

374
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,060
the Jamie Bode of truth,
Aka the Internet,

375
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,923
by the way.
You could,

376
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,380
you could take Fmr,
righ,

377
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,910
right?
Brain imaging studies of men that are

378
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:07,911
exposed to women of different waist to
hip ratios and their pleasure centers in

379
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:13,140
their brain light up more when exposed
to women that have that hourglass

380
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:13,680
figure.

381
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,050
So again,
the data is unassailable because it

382
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:20,430
comes from multitude of countries,
multitude of time periods using

383
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:22,800
different methods.
I'm not denying that men enjoy that.

384
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,960
What I'm saying is that that Saturday
was study.

385
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,130
Yeah.
By using hourglass figures on the

386
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,660
mannequins.
So let me,

387
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,160
let me build on that.
I,

388
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,680
I in one of my papers,
I looked at sex dolls,

389
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,540
right?
Sex Doll,

390
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,530
convenient money.
I have to look at sex dolls for a paper,

391
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,210
right?
Uh,

392
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,400
so anyways,
in that paper I just went to,

393
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:46,070
I can't remember the company's name.
It's,

394
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,510
it's a real dog.
Probably one of those,

395
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:50,970
was it a like a realistic one?
I mean,

396
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:52,830
I didn't get them at home and measured
them.

397
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,210
They don't mean one that looks like that
person looks like a person and they

398
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:59,880
advertise their measurements.
Okay.

399
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,790
And as you would expect,
the average waist to hip,

400
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,760
their hair color changes in their skin
color changes.

401
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:09,750
But the average waist to hip ratio was
close to that 0.7.

402
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,300
And so here what you're demonstrating is
that marketers,

403
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,010
right,
these guys that are producing these

404
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:17,880
products are producing products that are
aligned with our evolve preferences.

405
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,940
If they didn't do that,
if they produced a sex dolls that look

406
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:24,240
like east German female slash male
swimmers,

407
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,830
it's not going to work.
Well.

408
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,360
It's not going to say,
how dare you.

409
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,190
Those are women,
I think.

410
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,670
How are we going to get into the
intersex debate from the Olympics?

411
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,504
Is that what we're doing?

412
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,360
Um,
well the Olympics is a fascinating place

413
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,190
to jump off with that,
but no.

414
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,200
Um,
so I think,

415
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,090
okay.
The atomy anatomy of desire,

416
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
uh,
the two mannequins stood side by side,

417
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,091
blah,
blah,

418
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,820
blah.
Cargo van mobile vans.

419
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,720
Yeah.
Okay.

420
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,900
Mannequins.
Yeah,

421
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:51,900
it's just two mannequins.
It's a shit study.

422
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,920
They could have easily gotten strippers
published in one of the top science

423
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:56,754
journals,
but okay,

424
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,270
well I'm still still publish it all day.
It's,

425
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,290
I'm fucking mannequin.
Why would they,

426
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,860
you can get real women.
All right.

427
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,200
I'll speak to them.
The only the way that it would be rude.

428
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,400
Well,
even the woman who was like not chosen,

429
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,960
well you don't know.
I mean,

430
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:12,090
some,
some guys might be like in petite,

431
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,370
slim,
slender model type.

432
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,920
Well,
that's what's interesting to me is that

433
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:20,700
men aren't really attracted to that
model shape.

434
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,660
No.
Yeah.

435
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:24,870
It's weird cause women oftentimes think
that men are,

436
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:29,550
because they see these models in these
magazines and I think that does lean

437
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:33,980
towards the desire for some women to get
into that anorexic state because he's

438
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:37,380
sort of get this body dysmorphia thing
going on by looking at these,

439
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,600
uh,
almost a completely unrealistic to

440
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:39,900
pictures.

441
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,060
I mean,
I know people were actually built like

442
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:43,770
that,
but they're extremely rare.

443
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,450
Right?
It's like knowing someone who's built

444
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:47,980
like a professional basketball player,
they absolutely exist.

445
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,950
But boy,
good luck finding one on a random day,

446
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,680
finding some seven foot tall super
athlete.

447
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,940
Right?
Yeah.

448
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,660
No,
I agree.

449
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,450
Uh,
there's all sorts of differences between

450
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:01,360
what images that you see sometimes and
what people truly prefer.

451
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,130
I think it's really strange how women
always say want to paint it as women

452
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,520
being victimized by these unrealistic
body images.

453
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,080
But you never hear the same from men
when it comes to body builders,

454
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,970
right?
When men see a guy who's just giant

455
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:19,840
muscles that had big six pack and just
looks like a stud.

456
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,070
Men never feel like they're being
victimized by these unrealistic body on,

457
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,520
right?
I mean most of the guys that you see as

458
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:30,880
leading men on average tend to be taller
than the norm.

459
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:33,010
Right?
So I'm being victimized cause I'm a

460
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:36,280
shorter guy as if you don't,
if you forgive me for saying as you are,

461
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:36,490
right.

462
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,350
So how come we don't complain about,
you know,

463
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:41,200
short guys and he'd love as well?
Or how about social status?

464
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,860
Right?
Typically you see the six,

465
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,910
the depiction say in romance novels.
I've given this example on previous

466
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:47,590
occasions.
I'm not sure if I did on your show,

467
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,930
but if you,
if you studied the archetype of

468
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:52,450
masculinity in a romance novel,
they'll look,

469
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:53,920
fabio,
it's long hair.

470
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,000
It's exact same guy,
right?

471
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,880
He's tall,
he's account and he's a neurosurgeon.

472
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,930
He's rough.
He's reckless in terms of his risk

473
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:02,860
taking.
He can only be tamed by the love of this

474
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:05,500
one woman.
He wrestles alligators on his chest,

475
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,940
uh,
on a six pack,

476
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,890
right?
He's usually not a pear shape.

477
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,300
How many of these books you've read and
Man,

478
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:12,790
I'm reading them every single day.
I just read one before I came here.

479
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,090
It looks so deep.
But the reality is that that you know

480
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,990
the product works because there is a
commonality to what women fantasize

481
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:23,580
about,
right?

482
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,230
And whether she's Romanian or Nigerian
or Japanese,

483
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,800
she likely prefers a high status tall
alpha male to a nasal pear shaped a

484
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,330
wimp.
And,

485
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,080
and so that's how you describe yourself.
How rude I am.

486
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,210
I am the walking Alpha male side.

487
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,290
I could call you son cause you're a bit
younger than me.

488
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,440
We slightly plus I've got gray hair so
maybe I can get away with that

489
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:51,250
appellation.
But no look up products that work well

490
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,860
are typically those that are congruent
with our human nature.

491
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,020
Right?
And those that are not will typically

492
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:58,510
fail.
I've always wondered why women claim

493
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:02,710
victim status when they're,
they're being compared to unrealistic

494
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:06,150
body images,
but men don't because I think that just

495
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,990
kind of relates to social justice
warriors.

496
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,440
I've proposed the theory of Munchhausen
Syndrome.

497
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,810
Have you heard me talk about this?
I don't know what it is.

498
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:15,220
Yeah,
so Munchhausen's syndrome for those,

499
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,460
for the viewers who don't know is this,
you know,

500
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,470
you get sympathy and attention by being
victim and so you feign an illness to

501
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:27,130
get attention.
Munchhausen Syndrome by proxy is when

502
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:31,540
you hurt someone else was in your care,
typically an elderly person or a pet or

503
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:36,100
typically your biological child because
that will garn you garner you empathy

504
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:38,320
points at well,
so then to answer your question,

505
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:39,070
why do women do that?

506
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,420
Because some women ultimately I trapped
and they sort of big Munchhausen a love

507
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:47,810
fest where I need to constantly get
reaffirmation and empathy by being the

508
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:49,970
victim.
To the extent that Western women,

509
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,910
you know,
have been liberated from all of the

510
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,160
typical problems that we see in other
parts of the world.

511
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,770
I've got to look for a new victim
narrative and boom,

512
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,210
that's a good one.
Well,

513
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:03,200
isn't it also though that it is an
unrealistic body shape and that they do

514
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:07,910
feel it completely.
It's like a completely impossible task

515
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:10,190
for a lot of women who were built like
normal people.

516
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:14,720
Have you seen the body shapes of a male
superheroes and toys?

517
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,870
Yeah,
like Mason,

518
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,120
they let me shoot.
That's right.

519
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,480
They look at you.
So what about the rest of us that don't

520
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,640
look like you?
How come we don't go into a fetal

521
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:23,090
position?

522
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:26,420
I'm asking why did,
why is Munchhausen Syndrome more

523
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:31,030
apparent in women than it is in men?
Incidentally in the true form of much

524
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,660
housing,
in terms of harming a child,

525
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,550
it's usually always the biological
mother.

526
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,570
So you're exactly right.
So it's just a manifestation of that

527
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:41,510
phenomenon in a new context.
So you're exactly right.

528
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,240
That's interesting.
But I wouldn't have phrased it that way.

529
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:47,450
I would phrase it more of a term of
frustration then some sort of a

530
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,850
psychological disorder.
I would think that women are just

531
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:53,450
frustrated with this seat.
One of the differences being that if a

532
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,140
woman is large boned or la,
you know,

533
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,920
she has a wide waist or something like
that,

534
00:24:57,921 --> 00:25:01,310
there's very little she can do to try to
achieve that model shape.

535
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,920
Whereas if a man,
uh,

536
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:07,130
is slight,
he can lift weights and you know,

537
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,580
eat a lot of food and go get a personal
trainer and do a lot of squats and dead

538
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,650
lifts and build his body up,
right?

539
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,410
Like a man can make his body look more
masculine.

540
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,210
It's very difficult outside of surgery
for a woman to change the shape of her

541
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,400
body.
She can get in shape and if she's

542
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,070
overweight she can diminish that.
She can lose some fat.

543
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:25,911
She can,
you know,

544
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:28,300
put some meat on her butt and her legs
and,

545
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,340
but she can't like grow breasts,
you know,

546
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:33,740
she can't,
she can't do anything that would make

547
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:37,070
her appear more outwardly feminine.
You know what I'm saying?

548
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,130
By the way,
that exactly speaks to some of the

549
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:43,370
antipathy that people feel towards
evolutionary psychology.

550
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,481
I mean,
you hit the,

551
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:49,481
the nail the nail on the head yet
because there is wrongly saw,

552
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:53,660
there's this idea that evolutionary
theories sort of biological determinism,

553
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,840
right?
If people prefer facially symmetric

554
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,420
faces,
and if my face is not facially

555
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:03,110
symmetric,
then I'm doomed to a life of twiddling

556
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,700
my thumbs and the life of celibacy.

557
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,220
Right.
And that's why there's this narrative

558
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,120
that became famous with Naomi Wolf.
I don't know what,

559
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,320
do you know who that is?
He,

560
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,970
she wrote a book that sold,
I don't know how many millions of copies

561
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,940
called the beauty myth,
which I actually critique.

562
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:20,960
And my first book I talked about the
myth about the beauty myth and the

563
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:22,160
beauty myth.
Basically she,

564
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,810
she provides it this liberatory argument
against these beauty standards.

565
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,270
And here's her argument,
which I will sort of summarize very

566
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,650
quickly.
She basically says,

567
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:33,020
look,
women are now winning in every facet of

568
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:36,830
life.
And the only place that men can still

569
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:39,950
cause harm to women that they could
still dominate women.

570
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,440
And this is going to speak to one of the
points that you raised is by creating

571
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:44,190
this false

572
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,000
narrative about the types of women that
men prefer.

573
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,350
And by pushing this narrative,
it makes women feel insecure about

574
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:53,610
themselves.
Whoa,

575
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,730
hold on.
That's so her proposal is that the only

576
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:59,160
reason that this exists is because men
are trying to harm women.

577
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,430
It's a conspiratorial theory.
That's hilarious.

578
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,170
She must be a lot of fun to hang out
with.

579
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,090
She's not,
she's still alive.

580
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,711
She's alive.
Yeah.

581
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:07,440
Yeah.
She's,

582
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,810
yeah.
She's reasonably young and still very

583
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:11,070
productive.
Uh,

584
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,270
but you know,
again,

585
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:12,780
it's,
it's a,

586
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,260
it's a message that sells because if I
am a unattractive,

587
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,180
if genetically speaking,
uh,

588
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,870
I don't score well on some of these
universal metrics of beauty,

589
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,600
I would much rather hear a story that
basically says,

590
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,480
oh,
it's all due to arbitrary construction

591
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,800
of beauty standards.
It's not,

592
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:30,990
there's nothing innate about these.
Right.

593
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,680
I think there's a lot of women that are
very intelligent that run into asshole

594
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:41,460
men so many times that they developed
this distorted perception of what a man

595
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:41,790
is.

596
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,060
And so they can formulate this theory
and feel justified in doing so.

597
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,260
Is it just ran into so many weak bitches
out there that they start thinking that

598
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:50,650
all men are trying to harm them.
Right.

599
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,350
And all men are trying to hurt their
feelings.

600
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,760
Right.
And that this,

601
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:57,360
this theory is valid in her eyes because
it's based on the anecdotal evidence

602
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:59,790
that she's acquired through her whole
life of running it.

603
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,320
I mean,
obviously she's very intelligent.

604
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:04,230
She's writing books.
She's probably far more intelligent than

605
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:05,970
most of the men she's coming in contact
with.

606
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:10,160
And so she's formulated this theory
based on her own personal evidence,

607
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,720
protect her own ego or you're saying,
yeah,

608
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,970
but there's direct,
there's a direct connection.

609
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:18,930
Like as a man,
there is a huge difference in how you,

610
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,320
uh,
you react how your body feels when

611
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:24,630
you're around a classically attractive
woman.

612
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Like let's classkick attractive like
Sofia wren in her prime,

613
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,910
like when you're around it,
you'd just go,

614
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,980
Jesus,
like your hands would get sweaty,

615
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:37,020
your heart would start beating it start
freaking out.

616
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:41,790
It is 100% natural and there's,
there's no like,

617
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:44,430
uh,
oh I want to enforce this because it

618
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,620
will make other women feel like shit
like that.

619
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:51,120
That is not it.
There is a real genetic propensity and

620
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:55,470
it doesn't it seem as though that should
be so trivially the now to accept,

621
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,393
right?
I mean it's,

622
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,270
but it's not for someone who's an
empowered woman who doesn't see any way

623
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,130
of achieving the right.
So if you don't,

624
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,490
it's like a man could do steroids and
live weights and become a giant body

625
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:08,340
builder type dude if that's what he was
really into.

626
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:11,040
And you could achieve that through time
and effort,

627
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,993
but it can be done.

628
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,150
But for a woman to look like one of
those women,

629
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,000
it's impossible.
If you are not built like that,

630
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:20,370
you are not built like that.
And that's how it goes.

631
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:23,190
So I'll tell you a quick story that I
discussed in one of my other books.

632
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,940
It was a documentary that I had watched
on speed dating.

633
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:29,520
I think it was where there was a,
you know,

634
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,340
profoundly overweight woman,
I don't know,

635
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,090
500 pounds.
It was basically arguing that,

636
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,480
you know,
it's unfair that all these men at this

637
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:43,150
speed dating event are not paying closer
attention to her.

638
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,193
Okay,
that's fair.

639
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,420
It's unfair because they're,
they've been taught,

640
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,770
they've to internalize all these
arbitrary sexist standards of beauty.

641
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,460
So she was really sorry.
Yeah,

642
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,280
yeah.
Now,

643
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,580
but listen to this.
So on the one hand if you're unattracted

644
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,410
to an overly overtly overweight woman,
then you are a fattest.

645
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,710
But on the other hand doesn't,
this is the other side of the coin.

646
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,280
If you prefer very overweight women,
then there's the narrative that you are

647
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,440
fetishizing our,
you know,

648
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,300
access meat.
So if you prefer an overweight woman,

649
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,050
you're a bad guy.
And if you this slight overweight women,

650
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,380
you're a fat that.
So there's no state of the world where

651
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:28,630
someone won't accuse you of being an
asshole.

652
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,130
That's,
that's the world we live in.

653
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,300
Well isn't that just the world of just
so many different people with varied

654
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:37,210
opinions that are trying to justify
their own physical condition?

655
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,920
Sure.
We,

656
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,940
and that's really what it means.
Have Fragile Egos.

657
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,150
Well there's a new study that they put
out recently about the,

658
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,600
the myth of healthy obesity because I've
ever seen that read many times.

659
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,110
Or I've read that rather many times
where people are trying to justify their

660
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:56,920
own obesity by saying that there's this
distorted perception of whether or not

661
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,410
people are healthy because they are
thin.

662
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,020
And then in fact there are some
diseases.

663
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:04,780
And this is kind of true.
It's some sort of a weird contradiction.

664
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,610
There's some sort of diseases where
people actually do better if they

665
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,250
recover because they're overweight.
But the reason for that is not because

666
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:14,920
being overweight is healthy.
The reason for that is there's a lot of

667
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:18,820
diseases where you don't take in any
nutrients while you're sick and so your

668
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:23,170
body goes into a state of ketosis where
it starts burning fat and you're better

669
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:27,670
off using that fat for fuel if you are
overweight than if you are a very lean

670
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:31,380
person was no fat to burn.
Then your body starts burning off a

671
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,470
tissue muscle tissue,
which is much less healthy for you and

672
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:36,070
much more dangerous.
Incidentally,

673
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,380
what you said,
uh,

674
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:42,190
there's I think now a movement to start
fattest studies at universities.

675
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,800
You know how you have women's studies
and peace studies.

676
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,790
So fat to studies in the heart of is
exactly what you led off with,

677
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:52,780
which is the idea that there's this kind
of medical conspiracy that's pushing a

678
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:56,860
false narrative that basically says
being overweight as a bad thing,

679
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,020
when in reality there is no such
evidence.

680
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,350
You know,
there's evidence of,

681
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,650
no,
sorry folks,

682
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,140
pull up that study.
It's a,

683
00:32:04,141 --> 00:32:05,920
it's,
it's really kind of interesting because

684
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:09,010
it's so black and white.
There's just really no arguing about it.

685
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,170
Fuck it.
It's not good to overeat.

686
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,870
It's just not,
it's not good to tax your body,

687
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,940
you know,
having a little bit of fat.

688
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:18,670
It's not that bad.
Studies suggest healthy obesity might

689
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:20,410
just be a meth.
Um,

690
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,310
suggested vigorous health interventions
may be necessary for all obese

691
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,770
individuals.
Yeah,

692
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,520
that's a fact.
There you go.

693
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,110
But everybody knows that.
You know,

694
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:31,930
that that's why you see that fat woman
and people get repulsed.

695
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,170
It's not because they're mean.
It's because it's not because they're

696
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:38,290
taught to think that that's not an
objective standard of beauty.

697
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,070
It's just you see someone fat and you
go,

698
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:41,480
Oh,
this is a mess.

699
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,760
It's a mess.
This is someone who's must be

700
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,740
emotionally fragile because they're
there.

701
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,430
They're throwing food down their face.
They clearly have an addiction to sugar

702
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,040
or too simple carbs.
I mean,

703
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:52,491
they're,
they're,

704
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,820
they're definitely trying to make up for
something.

705
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,133
You know,
there's this,

706
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,900
this idea that people are just naturally
more fat.

707
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,000
Well,
that's not true because if you look at

708
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:05,060
their diet,
it's almost always in support of

709
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,480
maintaining a giant body.
I mean,

710
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:11,150
that's this idea that some people can,
well,

711
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:14,990
there are people that have hummingbird
type metabolisms and they can eat ding

712
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:17,270
dongs all day and still weigh 90 pounds.
Yeah,

713
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,460
that's a freak there.
There's a rare,

714
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,050
you know,
my sister was like that.

715
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,630
My sister's tiny.
Her nickname's peewee,

716
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,400
that's what I call her.
But when we were kids,

717
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,810
she was always,
uh,

718
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,070
she always weighed like a hundred
pounds.

719
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,480
She could fuck it,
eat anything.

720
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,660
She could trank she could have a steak,
she could eat ice cream,

721
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,280
90 pounds.
I mean,

722
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:35,510
that's just what she weighed.
Or,

723
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,890
you know,
maybe I'm exaggerating,

724
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:38,690
she might weigh 105,
but you know what I'm saying?

725
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,390
Like she just had that crazy metabolism.
It's just the way it is now.

726
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,090
But that's super unusual,
right?

727
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,910
For most people.
And you overeat.

728
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,420
I've posted a few photos on social media
of yourself,

729
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:52,460
myself at 1985.
Actually,

730
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:54,770
that was the first time that I've come
to California to visit my brother.

731
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:57,380
And your soccer players Subtler,
uh,

732
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,160
four or 5% body fat.
And of course I said you really get it

733
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:02,240
checked.
I did get a check.

734
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:03,140
Yeah.
But Calipers,

735
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:03,440
right?

736
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,590
Pri Calipers and the electric
conductivity tests.

737
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,060
Yeah,
the electric thing sucks.

738
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,840
I've done that electric thing before.
It was an in real ways submerging,

739
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,310
submerging the electric thing.
Apparently if you're dehydrated it can

740
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:18,110
be off.
There's a lot of like very fat cause

741
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:18,950
it's,
it,

742
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,860
a lot of it is,
I might be using a bad one,

743
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,860
but the one of them using was a one in a
doctor's office,

744
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,370
but he was even explaining to me that it
can easily be off if you,

745
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:29,121
uh,
have,

746
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:31,650
um,
if you're dehydrated and there's very

747
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,020
various factors,
whatever the number was,

748
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,700
was very low.
And this was 85,

749
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,780
so this is almost 30,
well more than 30 years ago.

750
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,870
And until up til about my early
twenties,

751
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,740
22,
23,

752
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:45,200
24,
I was always grossly underweight.

753
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,410
The day that I stopped being a serious
athlete,

754
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,850
it just snuck up on me.

755
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,500
Every single,
it's a coincidence.

756
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,820
That's all that is.
You think so?

757
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,743
No.
Okay.

758
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,270
Of course,
I didn't pick up on the sarcasm.

759
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,231
You know,
it's,

760
00:34:58,231 --> 00:35:02,180
it's very insane.
This is society's standards that they're

761
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,790
enforcing.
I knew God,

762
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,320
exactly.
Venture of these assholes.

763
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:09,050
What it is,
is a bench of men who want you to feel

764
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:10,730
bad.
Right?

765
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,541
Right.
Yeah.

766
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:12,374
So they,
uh,

767
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,450
they let you eat.
There you go.

768
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:14,961
Yeah,
man.

769
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:16,940
Just fucking run every day.
You'll lose a ton of weight.

770
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,920
Well,
not,

771
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:21,230
that's not enough because I actually,
believe it or not,

772
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,410
I trained a lot.
The only way I lose weight as if I'm

773
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,090
very,
very careful about what I eat.

774
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,250
Well,
she thought that I never lose weight.

775
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,830
But you're a smart guy.
Why do you allow yourself to get

776
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,840
overweight?
Oh boy.

777
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,540
We're going to get into this now.
I mean,

778
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:36,500
this is a subject,
right?

779
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,140
Yeah.
Okay.

780
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,010
Uh,
I mean,

781
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,840
I don't think it's related to your
intelligence because,

782
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,501
well,
it must be,

783
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:40,801
right.
Well,

784
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:42,300
let me give you an issue.
No,

785
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,810
no.
We'll,

786
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,720
we'll just so quick to dismiss,
but it is an issue,

787
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,640
right?
You walked into a physician's office

788
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,080
when I had severe bronchitis.
He's,

789
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,740
he was I think a pulmonologist.
He was chain smoking in his office.

790
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,980
Now is that because he was an idiot who
didn't understand the yes.

791
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,930
Yeah.
He's an idiot if he's changed,

792
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,810
but it's an idea.
It's not correlated to his Iq.

793
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:04,411
Right.
It's just,

794
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:08,970
it's correlated to his objective
assessment of what is intelligent to do

795
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:12,090
with your meat vehicle.
This guy is stupid.

796
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:14,490
If he smoked cigarettes,
that is a stupid thing to do.

797
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,160
It doesn't mean that he can't be
intelligent in other areas of his life,

798
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:21,930
but he's most certainly shutting down or
ignoring some really clear information

799
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,360
that we have been given for the past,
you know,

800
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,860
50 plus years.

801
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,080
Well,
I think actually what you're,

802
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,290
what are you talking about speaks to a
point that I reason some of my writings,

803
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,060
the idea of whether we make choices
simply because we don't have the right

804
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,080
information to make better choices.
That's usually the typical argument that

805
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,840
public policy makers use.
So that basically say,

806
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,913
Oh,
if you're,

807
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,570
if you're engaging in,
uh,

808
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,540
on,
you know,

809
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,420
uh,
risky sexual behavior,

810
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:50,490
or if you're engaging in a sedentary
lifestyle,

811
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,550
it's because you don't know any better.
So let's set up public service

812
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:56,610
announcements that teach you a better,
and then hopefully people will act

813
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:58,870
better and that doesn't actually work so
on.

814
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:01,640
So the issue is not so much that people,
you know,

815
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,600
it's not as though I don't know that
being overweight is a bad thing.

816
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,720
And now that you've taught me better,
I will now change my behavior.

817
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,440
The problem stems from the fact that
there are these Darwinian pools that

818
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:16,590
make it difficult for us to extricate
ourselves quite.

819
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,960
Whether it be,
whether you're addicted to drugs because

820
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:21,240
it tickles your pleasure center in your
brain,

821
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,190
or whether it be because you addicted to
sex,

822
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:26,370
or whether you're addicted to a bit more
food than you should be eating.

823
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,860
Those are the Darwinian pools,
uh,

824
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:32,370
Poles that make it difficult for us to
do the optimal decision.

825
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:34,920
It's not because we're too dumb to know
better or we don't have the right

826
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:35,620
information.
But you,

827
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,141
William,
you're,

828
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:38,100
you're,
you're talking about food now,

829
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:40,530
not the cigarettes that this doctor was
smoking,

830
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:43,890
that you were using it as an example.
That's not the best one because there's

831
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:46,740
no Darwinian pool towards smoking
satellites.

832
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,180
Forget,
forget the,

833
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,890
the nicotine example of what I just
said.

834
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,970
In general,
when we make poor decisions that lead to

835
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,390
deleterious health outcomes,
it's not because we don't know any

836
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:59,550
better.
So let's go back to this suntanning

837
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:00,384
example.

838
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,450
Women know more about the deleterious
effects of sun exposure than men do yet

839
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:09,060
they do with more.
If it were only a question of,

840
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,950
you know,
it's because I don't know any better

841
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,450
than,
we wouldn't expect women to be doing it

842
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,280
more.
So it's not a question of not having the

843
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:16,620
right information.
It's whether ultimately you have the

844
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:19,230
control to not succumb to these polls.
I mean,

845
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:22,380
we've got the seven deadly sins since,
you know,

846
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,250
since for thousands of years precisely
because very smart people understood

847
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:28,950
that these are some traps that we all
succumb to,

848
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,610
whether it be greed or lust or gluttony.
And my case,

849
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,980
I've never smoked.
I've never drank.

850
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,530
But very,
I mean,

851
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,363
an elite.

852
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,540
My problem is I guess gluttony.
I'm a gluttonous.

853
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:42,490
Right?
But when you say have the control,

854
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,340
like what,
but what steps have you ever taken to

855
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:46,600
acquire the control?
I mean,

856
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,880
do you practice mindfulness?
Do you meditate?

857
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,810
Do you write down your goals?
Do you write down like what you eat and

858
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:53,500
what your cow,
you,

859
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,860
have you ever gone to a doctor and found
out what your calorie consumption should

860
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:59,380
be?
Have you ever tried to alter your diet

861
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:02,770
and maybe go on a fat burning diet
instead of on a carbohydrate burning

862
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,510
diet?
Not the mindfulness,

863
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:07,150
but all the other stuff that you've done
in a fat burning diet instead of

864
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:08,800
carbohydrates.
Absolutely.

865
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:13,270
So what have you done for them?
And when I do it [inaudible] you'll see

866
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:16,480
me in three months,
I'll be 35 pounds lighter and you won't

867
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,900
believe in what have you done?
Like what pro?

868
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,340
So I just do a heavy protein dive,
minimal carbs with a lot of vegetables,

869
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,203
so upbeat,
you know,

870
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,170
six ounce steak,
you know,

871
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,550
with Broccoli and whatever,
something like that with the tomato

872
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:31,460
juice.
Uh,

873
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,060
and that I'll,
I'll loose kind of like the,

874
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:35,980
uh,
well not the Atkins in the sense that

875
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:40,000
you'd eat as much fat as you want,
but it's really a lot of protein and a

876
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:41,050
lot of vegetables.
Well,

877
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:44,920
honestly the Atkins is when you're
saying eat as much fat as you want

878
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,690
there.
That is actually the trend.

879
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,950
The trend is towards a,
a ketogenic diet when he talking about

880
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,460
getting your body to burn fat,
a lot of athletes are getting involved

881
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:58,180
in getting on fat burning diets.
And I actually switched my own diet to

882
00:39:58,181 --> 00:39:59,610
that where,
I mean,

883
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:01,930
it didn't really have a problem being
overweight,

884
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,410
but I was definitely heavier and I had
more body fat than I have now.

885
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,740
And what I did was I switched over to
this.

886
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,250
Uh,
this is a guy named Mark Sisson who was

887
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,050
on my podcast before.
Um,

888
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,150
and he wrote this book called the primal
blueprint.

889
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,350
And,
uh,

890
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:19,350
it's the idea behind it is that you're,
when you're eating a lot of simple carbs

891
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,630
and a lot of pastas and breads,
you're getting insulin spikes,

892
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:26,230
your body's processing all that sugar
and your body stores it and your body

893
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:29,290
starts burning sugar.
Whereas if you can get your body to a

894
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:32,260
ketogenic state,
meaning your body burns fats and uses

895
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:36,790
that for fuel rather than carbohydrates,
you don't really want high protein.

896
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,040
You want,
um,

897
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,100
uh,
minimal protein.

898
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:41,320
You want what you're supposed to have,
which is like,

899
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,030
you know,
six ounce steak is fine,

900
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,210
but what you really want is a bunch of
healthy fats like coconut oil,

901
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,190
Avocados.
I eat a lot of Avocados.

902
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,130
Salmon is excellent,
excellent.

903
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:54,550
But also because excellent because it
supplies you with Omega six isn't threes

904
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,190
the essential fatty acids,
which are really important for brain

905
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,350
function.
But people this,

906
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:02,020
this idea,
this is also a big fucking problem that

907
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:05,140
people have.
We've been lied to about fats,

908
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:08,980
about the danger of saturated fats and
the danger of cholesterol.

909
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,390
Dietary cholesterol barely moves the
needle on blood lipids.

910
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,580
It's not dietary cholesterol.
It's a problem.

911
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,710
It's sedentary lifestyle.
It's overeating.

912
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,900
It's a consumption of excess carbs is a
bunch of factors that cause people to be

913
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:27,901
fat and it's not necessarily saturated
fats or or um,

914
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,980
or cholesterol.
In fact,

915
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:33,130
saturated fats and cholesterol,
that's the substrate for building

916
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,310
testosterone.
Like when,

917
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:37,980
when I went on this diet of,
uh,

918
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,660
having my body burn fat and not just me,
but a ton of my friends,

919
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,300
my friend Denny,
um,

920
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,570
uh,
who was a,

921
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:47,540
a an elite athlete is a Brazilian
Jujitsu world champion.

922
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,090
Um,
my friend John Rollo who's a MMA

923
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,380
fighter,
Brazilian Jujitsu,

924
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,230
black belt,
these guys have all reported jai and me

925
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:57,320
included gigantic spikes in their
testosterone production.

926
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,740
And it's because that is the building
blocks for testosterone.

927
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:04,100
So when you're eating these low fat
diets and these,

928
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:07,040
uh,
these like minimalistic diets to try to

929
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:10,820
get your body to be more healthy,
you're dropping your body sex hormone

930
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:12,440
production.
Well,

931
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:15,170
we'll have to ask my wife if she has any
complaints of that department.

932
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,033
But,
uh,

933
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,230
Oh God,
fuck.

934
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,690
Honestly,
uh,

935
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,820
the only problem I have is when I walk,
when I walk away from those types of

936
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,620
dyes,
that is where the problem arises.

937
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,520
Of course.
Yeah.

938
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,570
But I bet that if you walked away from
what had,

939
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,870
whenever you're on that diet,
when you get off it,

940
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,620
the things this integrate very quickly.
If you don't descend it,

941
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,483
well,
I'm,

942
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,140
but I guess for me they do.

943
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,891
I mean,
I could,

944
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:46,340
I could put on seven pounds in two weeks
by simply eating.

945
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:49,400
Normally once I'm away from that side is
normal.

946
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:53,510
Then if you're putting that much weight,
seven pounds in two weeks is 14 pounds

947
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:54,344
in a month.
I mean,

948
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,020
that means 28 pounds in two months.
Some liberty,

949
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,450
that's not normal.
Okay.

950
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,770
That's a crazy amount of weight to put
on.

951
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,410
If I saw you two months later and you
put it on 28 pounds,

952
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:05,120
I'm like,
what the fuck are you doing?

953
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,740
No,
I'd have to grab you by the hand and sit

954
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:07,730
down with you and go,
come on,

955
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:08,750
man.
I don't want you to die.

956
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,460
I,
I'm already thinking about all the

957
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,110
comments that are going to be at the
blind.

958
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,300
Oh boy.
Well I'm,

959
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,050
I mean I'm just saying this cause I'm
your friend.

960
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,760
I want to get your copy of this book.

961
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,490
Okay.
That I would love you to try to do it,

962
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:24,350
but it's not hard to just eat til you're
satisfied and not eat until you're full.

963
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,980
That's a big factor.
That alone is probably 20% of everyone's

964
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,650
meal.
A lot of people eat and then they keep

965
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,120
going.
I love to do that.

966
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,360
That's fucking awesome.
I love to eat a giant bowl of pasta and

967
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:38,450
eat a big steak,
but I also work out like a terrorist.

968
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,640
I do that.
I work out almost every day.

969
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,570
I kind of work out hard,
so I keep my body fat down because of

970
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:46,250
that.
So even if my diet has shit,

971
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,600
I still keep my body fat down because of
tremendous working out.

972
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:55,130
But then when I adjust my diet as well,
I saw a big difference in my energy

973
00:43:55,131 --> 00:44:00,020
levels and my cognitive function and a,
and a big difference in just overall

974
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:00,854
wellness.
Right.

975
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:01,743
You know,
I just don't,

976
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,440
I mean I'm an extremist when it comes to
physical performance because obviously

977
00:44:06,441 --> 00:44:09,900
I've been around it my whole life and
I'm in the martial arts world and I'm,

978
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:13,670
I'm trying to get my body to do certain
things that are very unusual.

979
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:18,970
But I just think that people are not
designed to eat big plates of Pasta or

980
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,900
bread or all these sugars that everybody
downs in the form of corn syrup drinks.

981
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,480
It's just not good for you.
Have you seen the uh,

982
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,120
documentary sugar

983
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,390
or something?
I can't remember what the sugar,

984
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,650
that sugar movie.
Yeah,

985
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:36,930
it was crazy.
Festival is a watch with my kids and

986
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:39,050
then we went to the supermarket was
hilarious cause they're,

987
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:42,690
they're grabbing things,
going sugar in this,

988
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:44,550
they were like grabbing things off the
shelf,

989
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,580
finding how many grams of sugar per
serving or,

990
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:48,570
and everything.
So let us,

991
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,580
maybe I'll say this,
you know,

992
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,410
if you say something publicly,
then you have to kind of add to it.

993
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:53,280
Say it.
So let,

994
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,740
here's,
here's what should I look at the camera

995
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:56,574
here?
Uh,

996
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:01,140
next time I'm on your show,
I should hopefully be visibly thinner.

997
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,330
Yeah.
Which you're going to do is you're going

998
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:04,740
to wait until two weeks before the show
and then you're going to stop your

999
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:07,760
period and you're going to do,
I'm going to go anorexia,

1000
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,400
Anorexia and stop your reproductive
system.

1001
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,060
Very nice.
Yeah.

1002
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,650
I mean it's just people should be more
healthy and the body is designed,

1003
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,680
I mean this is this whole trend for like
Paleo Diet,

1004
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,610
Paleo diets and Paleolithic Diet.
That's not an accurate term.

1005
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,650
It's a,
it's an,

1006
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,280
it's an,
it's a good way to eat,

1007
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,120
but it's not an accurate evolutionary
term because in the Para Paleolithic

1008
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:31,410
era,
people ate a lot of grains.

1009
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:33,210
They whatever the fuck they could,
they bugs.

1010
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,540
They were hungry,
you know,

1011
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,890
and they worked hard to acquire it off.
Yes,

1012
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,270
exactly.
That's a big point.

1013
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,550
When they needed those calories in
grains,

1014
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:41,851
like,
look,

1015
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:44,100
if you're out hiking every day,
you talk to people that are like

1016
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:47,400
mountain climbers and hikers,
like they're eating massive amounts of

1017
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,700
calories.
I have friends that go on these gigantic

1018
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,880
mountain trips and they literally cannot
consume enough because they pack all

1019
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:57,330
their food.
Um,

1020
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:02,130
and my friend Jason just got back from
this a big trip that he was taking to

1021
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,220
the Yukon and he's going up and doing
all this mountain climbing.

1022
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,190
They climbed a,
they went a hundred miles in eight days

1023
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:11,820
up in the mountains,
like at 10,000 feet altitude.

1024
00:46:11,821 --> 00:46:14,820
So it's,
it's this incredibly grueling experience

1025
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:18,720
because there's very little air and
you're constantly doing squats cause

1026
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:23,460
you're constantly lifting your body up.
You're going up hill and they were

1027
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:25,860
eating two pounds of food a day.
That's all you could take.

1028
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,280
So you have to eat the most calorie
dense two pounds of food that you could

1029
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,710
carry because you know,
for this trip,

1030
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:33,060
you know,
you're only carrying a certain amount of

1031
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:35,340
food cause you have to have your
sleeping bag on your back,

1032
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:36,960
your tent,
all that jazz.

1033
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,960
And he'd come out of there,
you're 15 pounds lighter right here.

1034
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,090
And you know,
you just had this incredible,

1035
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,290
I mean it's like,
it's,

1036
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,420
it's like running a marathon every day
almost.

1037
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,600
Are you familiar with the field of
evolutionary medicine?

1038
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:50,760
Does that ring a bell?
What way?

1039
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,510
So evolutionary medicine is basically,
actually I had one of the pioneers of

1040
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,680
the field on my show.
His name is Randy Nessa.

1041
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:59,880
He's a physician by training.
So evolutionary medicine is basically

1042
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:03,750
trying to infuse within medicine
evolutionary ideas.

1043
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,450
Uh,
typically most physicians are trained in

1044
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:07,710
the proximate world,
right?

1045
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:11,460
We were talking about proximate and
ultimate about how to deal with the how

1046
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:15,330
and what other disease without ever
asking the ultimate wide Darwinian why.

1047
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,970
So as relating to something that we
talking about now,

1048
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:20,820
if you look at the top killers around
the world,

1049
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,730
you know,
colon cancer and diabetes and heart

1050
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:28,140
disease and high blood pressure,
they're all related.

1051
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,140
As evolutionary folks argue to that,
what's called the mismatch hypothesis.

1052
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,440
The idea being that those things that
were adaptive to us in an environment of

1053
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:44,341
scarcity become grossly maladaptive and
an environment of plenty like we have

1054
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:45,070
today.

1055
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,320
That makes sense.
And so basically what you're having,

1056
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:49,570
I mean,
my gustatory preferences don't change.

1057
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,720
So my desire to eat the fatty foods
remains.

1058
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,880
But what has changed is the fact that I
used,

1059
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,620
I had to do 20,000 calories of
expenditure to punt it down then and now

1060
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:01,630
I could go to the grocery store and get
it.

1061
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:04,270
There is no caloric uncertainty in local
a scarcity.

1062
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:08,380
And so if you look at hunter gatherer
societies that most closely mimic,

1063
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,120
you know,
our evolutionary past,

1064
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:15,610
they don't have all those diseases.
So once they clear the early childhood

1065
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:20,611
mortality threats than they actually
live quite long lifespans precisely

1066
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:24,010
because they don't suffer from,
I think they're the nine top killers.

1067
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,730
So that's a way of taking some of this
stuff that you're very interested in and

1068
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:30,250
infusing it with a bit more of an
evolutionary twist.

1069
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:34,220
So that totally makes sense that people
would have to expand massive amount of

1070
00:48:34,221 --> 00:48:35,500
cowers to track down food.

1071
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,460
Because that was at one point in time
what we did all day with our day,

1072
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:42,520
whether it's hunting or gathering or or
farming.

1073
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,240
We were constantly working to try to
acquire food.

1074
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,250
That was it.
Now that food is so easy,

1075
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:50,080
we still have the same genes.
Right?

1076
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:50,770
Exactly.
Right.

1077
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,990
Yeah.
So look natural selection,

1078
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,270
right?
That the mechanism of how species

1079
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:57,010
evolve,
traits that they have.

1080
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,920
I mean it all,
when I teaching my students,

1081
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,020
I start off by colloquially saying,
look,

1082
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:04,240
most animals,
including humans throughout their

1083
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,890
history had faced,
you know,

1084
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,480
either you don't want to become somebody
else's dinner and you want to get enough

1085
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,870
for dinner for yourself.
Those are the sort of the two big that

1086
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:16,660
the problems.
And then you just add to that sexual

1087
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:18,730
selection,
which is it's not enough to simply

1088
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:20,320
survive.
Then you have to mate.

1089
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,800
And so then you had want to get the
right mannequin that I tear you go.

1090
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,940
So that's basically natural and sexual
selection and in one sentence,

1091
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:29,860
right,
don't become somebody dinner,

1092
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,280
get enough dinner and then get a mate.
And there's your evolutionary is how

1093
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:34,061
much,
if at all,

1094
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:36,430
do you pay attention to your gut health?
Do you,

1095
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,410
do you eat probiotics?
Ooh,

1096
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,180
see that's crazy.
Is that right?

1097
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,930
Oh my God.
Probiotics are one of the most important

1098
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:48,931
aspects of healthy bodies like your gut
health can infect or can affect rather

1099
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:51,700
your mood.
It can affect cognitive function,

1100
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,240
can affect your personality.
There's all these studies being done now

1101
00:49:55,241 --> 00:50:00,050
on probiotics and of gut health and
bacteria content and Gut Candida.

1102
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,280
If you have a high level of candy to
which a lot of people do eat a lot of

1103
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:05,810
sugar and simple carbs,
it be,

1104
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,130
it developed.
You developed this intense craving and

1105
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:14,131
hunger for sugar and simple carbs.
When you adjust your gut bacteria,

1106
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:18,180
when you start taking in healthy
probiotics in the form of Keifer.

1107
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,020
Um,
I like Kombucha.

1108
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,710
I like Kimchi.
I like fermented cabbage and sauerkrauts

1109
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:25,690
and natural sauerkrauts and things along
those lines.

1110
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,421
Um,
I,

1111
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:27,980
I drank a of different kinds

1112
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,010
of them and take a bunch of different
kinds of them every day along with this

1113
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:33,080
thing called the,
on it total gut health,

1114
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,450
which is a packet that I take with every
meal.

1115
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,960
It's a massive factor because what's in
your gut,

1116
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:43,460
like your gut flora is incredibly
important for your overall health and

1117
00:50:43,461 --> 00:50:47,750
for supporting your immune system.
So has that become sort of part of the

1118
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:48,860
daily,
not daily,

1119
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,920
the yearly,
a health checkup that people do?

1120
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,980
It depends on what doctor you're talking
to.

1121
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:56,420
You see,
because most doctors spend very little

1122
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:58,010
time studying nutrition,
right?

1123
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,650
When you go to medical school and you
get a degree,

1124
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,440
you,
I mean the amount of hours that you

1125
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:07,070
spend studying nutrition are so small
end by the time you're out there

1126
00:51:07,071 --> 00:51:09,650
practicing.
This is a field that's constantly

1127
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:11,930
evolving and changing and growing and
this,

1128
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:16,990
this 10 toward this,
I'm leaning towards probiotics as a a

1129
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:17,840
health supplement.

1130
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,470
It's fairly recent in terms of like
mainstream exposure,

1131
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,860
but incredibly important.
It makes a big fee.

1132
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,600
First of all,
I hardly ever get sick and it's a big

1133
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:29,030
factor cause I,
I travel constantly.

1134
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,800
You're shaking hands,
shaking,

1135
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:31,690
hands,
icons.

1136
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,540
I'm constantly flying on planes and I
hardly ever get sick and if I do I can

1137
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:38,270
point to some pretty obvious factors.
Like I didn't get any sleep.

1138
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:40,430
My kids are going to school again.
They were around other people that are

1139
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,930
sick.
They're sitting in my lap,

1140
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:45,140
Kop it in my face.
It's normal stuff.

1141
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,470
And even then I bounced back very
quickly and I attribute that to

1142
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:51,080
probiotics.
I think it's really important to take in

1143
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:52,490
healthy cultures.
Have you,

1144
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,560
are you feeling,
here's another example from evolutionary

1145
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:56,930
medicine that relates to children's
since you mentioned children.

1146
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,030
Uh,
you probably have heard of the studies

1147
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:03,350
that show that if you grow up in an
environment that doesn't have any

1148
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,800
natural,
uh,

1149
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,140
allergens,
you at an increased risk of developing

1150
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,390
respiratory illnesses like asthma.

1151
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,540
That makes sense sic because it doesn't
trigger your immune system to have the

1152
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:19,310
types of responses that you typically
would have encountered.

1153
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:23,990
So if you have a mother or a father or
both parents who are incredibly lcd

1154
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:27,500
about having a perfectly sterile and
spotless home,

1155
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,910
prepare for the onset of asthma,
that's another example of it's asthma,

1156
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:33,730
but not necessarily allergies.
My,

1157
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,990
my,
one of my daughters is allergic to cats.

1158
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,590
We've had cats her whole life.
We've also had dogs her whole life.

1159
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,570
She's been around in these animals her
whole life,

1160
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:42,870
but she's allergic to them.
What,

1161
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,070
what are the manifestations of,
she starts sneezing or eyes get puffy.

1162
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:48,290
The cat can't sleep in the bed with her.
If the cat does,

1163
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,660
she'll,
she starts sneezing and she can't help.

1164
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:52,360
But it's soon.
It's because my wife's allergic.

1165
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,720
It's just genetics.
Okay.

1166
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,870
Yeah.
She's also solar g to horses that we

1167
00:52:56,871 --> 00:53:00,710
were in Italy and we were riding on one
of those horse carriages and she wasn't

1168
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:04,160
even on the horse or touching the horse
just but being behind the horse on a

1169
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:06,740
horse carriage,
she starts sneezing and coughing and we

1170
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:07,810
had to get off the,
uh,

1171
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,660
off the carriage.

1172
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,940
You know,
it fits the saliva,

1173
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,930
the horse or the standard.
The dander.

1174
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:13,550
Yeah.
I'm sure she's allergic to saliva too,

1175
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:15,530
but I'm just not swapping spit with a
horse and grow.

1176
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,210
Settle down.
Gotcha.

1177
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,430
All right.
What's next on the docket?

1178
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,160
Now that you've convinced me that I eat
to lose weight as well.

1179
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:23,930
I'm not saying that you need to lose
weight,

1180
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:26,400
but I'm saying you're a healthy,
you're a smart guy.

1181
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:29,190
You think about it very good life.
You're very handsome,

1182
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:30,850
you bronze,
you're shiny.

1183
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:35,070
You're thinking in these terms of like
looking at the big picture,

1184
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:39,360
but yet there you've got this blind spot
and his blind spot is because you have

1185
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:42,090
this indulgence for food and you look
forward to it.

1186
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:45,420
It becomes your reward at the end of the
day and you sit down,

1187
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:46,860
did you indulge?
And then you,

1188
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:47,641
you say,
Hey,

1189
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,460
I've worked hard for this and I can
enjoy it and now I'm married,

1190
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,020
I've got kids I don't need to look
beautiful.

1191
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,220
And you want to hear something that says
we're getting personal in California,

1192
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:59,940
when we lived in California,
I actually naturally lost a lot of

1193
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:01,650
weight without having to worry about
anything.

1194
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,290
I was a lot more active.
I ate less.

1195
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:07,620
And what about you?
We've talked about a reward when you're

1196
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:12,621
in the dark cold winters of Montreal and
the only reward delivery system is for

1197
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:17,370
us to be foodies,
then that's the problem.

1198
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:18,930
Right.
And we often talk about that.

1199
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:21,330
My wife and I because we eat at Joe beef
and Montreal,

1200
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,470
uh,
that he's your friend,

1201
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:22,891
right?
Yeah.

1202
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:24,510
If you eat in there,
I have not.

1203
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,600
Good Lord.
You are in the same town as the greatest

1204
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:30,180
restaurant on the planet earth.
We're supposed to go there together.

1205
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:33,180
I think when can go back,
something happened.

1206
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,320
Yeah,
we will.

1207
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,030
Next time.
Next time I'm there.

1208
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,140
I'll take you.

1209
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,450
Hopefully I'll be in California.
Going to have to,

1210
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:40,201
yeah,
hopefully.

1211
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:42,870
But if you are there,
you're going to have to indulge.

1212
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,700
Yeah.
That's one of those places we've got to

1213
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:45,710
get off the ducks.
Yeah.

1214
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,610
Well it's,
it's okay to have a cheat day.

1215
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,533
Yeah,
you're right.

1216
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,370
But you know,
um,

1217
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:53,820
I think a lot of people have those blind
spots and even intelligent.

1218
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:54,654
Pete,
what's yours?

1219
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,260
Ooh,
booze.

1220
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,320
Yesterday we got fucked up.
Me and Hannibal burress to the podcast.

1221
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:03,750
We've got a little too hammered.
That's one of those things where I enjoy

1222
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:06,390
it while it's happening,
but like I worked out today and my head

1223
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:07,620
was kind of throbbing.
I was like,

1224
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:10,650
this is so stupid.
And then I don't do it every day,

1225
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:15,180
but I do it maybe once a week or once
every two weeks or something like that.

1226
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,660
It's just,
I know objectively that it's not healthy

1227
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:22,770
so that you enjoy the taste or the
effects after your drinks.

1228
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,890
Enjoy having drinks with friends and
getting stupid laughing,

1229
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,023
you know?
Um,

1230
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,070
that,
I just know it's not healthy.

1231
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,290
It's just,
there's nothing healthy about booze.

1232
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,670
Right.
There's nothing wrong.

1233
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,310
And actually there is some,
some studies that suggest that,

1234
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:38,040
uh,
it's a actually pretty healthy to have a

1235
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:41,190
glass of wine or two with a meal and you
know,

1236
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:45,920
you're getting Rivera trawl.
And also there's some studies that uh,

1237
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:46,803
or,
or some,

1238
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,840
uh,
some indications at 0.2 people developed

1239
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:56,580
for a long time drinking wine because
they couldn't drink still water because

1240
00:55:56,581 --> 00:56:00,330
they would get traveler's disease where
if they found water would have pathogens

1241
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:02,130
in it and they would wind up getting
sick.

1242
00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:05,280
So they drank wine for that purpose
because he can carry it around with you

1243
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:07,350
and it's not going to go bad.
But um,

1244
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,220
but getting drunk like we were drinking
whiskey,

1245
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,810
drink jamison or something like that,
I'm out on the rocks.

1246
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:14,850
It felt great,
were hammered and laughing.

1247
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,460
But God damn it,
it's so bad for your body.

1248
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,890
So if there's,
if there's an indulgence that I take

1249
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:23,320
part in that's not good.
It's the occasional getting fucked up.

1250
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:23,980
Gotcha.

1251
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,120
Yeah,
it's not good,

1252
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,910
but I don't have a lot of those.
I mean,

1253
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,900
I'm pretty good at not having a lot of
those,

1254
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,510
those things in my life,
but it's easy to do that.

1255
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:35,740
It's easy to trip yourself up because
there's a natural tendency towards

1256
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:37,240
distraction.
You know,

1257
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:40,690
the pressure of a attempting to be
successful at something.

1258
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:44,590
The pressure of whether it's competition
or whether it's uh,

1259
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,490
just this yearning for achievement.
We look for a release,

1260
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:49,630
you know,
from that pressure.

1261
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,700
And that's what a lot of people do.
They go to cigarettes,

1262
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:54,220
so they go to booze or they go to food
or whatever it is.

1263
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,430
Yeah.
I've never smoked a single cigarette in

1264
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,640
my entire life.
Good one puff good.

1265
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,750
I did when I was like 15.
I smoked a cigarette with my sister.

1266
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,730
She kept going.
I quit.

1267
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,451
I was like,
fuck,

1268
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:05,410
this is so stupid.

1269
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,740
Is that,
I think that if you hit 19 and you

1270
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:11,630
haven't started,
you almost have zero chance of starting.

1271
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,041
Oh,
I know.

1272
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:16,030
People have started in their thirties
due to start study was fucking 40 years

1273
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,270
old.
He started smoking cigarettes,

1274
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:18,790
smoking.
What are you doing man?

1275
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,070
So weird.
But again,

1276
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,440
I think it's a sabotage thing where
people just go,

1277
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,270
fuck it.
We don't care.

1278
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,790
And by doing that,
it's almost like they can,

1279
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,080
um,
by saying,

1280
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:30,520
fuck it,
I don't care about my health.

1281
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:31,660
They could say,
fuck it.

1282
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:33,610
I don't care about my student loans.
Fuck it.

1283
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:35,680
I don't care about my wife leaving me.
Fuck it.

1284
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:37,780
I don't care about my mortgage.
Fuck it.

1285
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:40,570
I don't care about losing my job.
It's like this,

1286
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:45,490
this sort of like denial of reality by
indulging in something that's not

1287
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:48,820
healthy.
It reminded me of a irrational position

1288
00:57:48,821 --> 00:57:53,200
that one of my former students took to
justify him smoking.

1289
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,020
And so if you,
I don't know if you'd do this in the

1290
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:57,070
United States,
but in Canada,

1291
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:58,440
Health Canada,
uh,

1292
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:03,430
has this program where they put very
vivid images on cigarette packets.

1293
00:58:03,431 --> 00:58:04,370
You have the same thing here,
right?

1294
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,950
They used to,
well,

1295
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,710
not that they don't have images,
but they have the sayings.

1296
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:11,020
Okay.
But in Canada with these images,

1297
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,730
I should even say they used to,
they still do.

1298
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:14,860
There's still like,
so you know what he would do,

1299
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:18,460
what to show you how irrational human
beings are.

1300
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,530
So he would,
let's say ask for whatever the brand was

1301
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:25,390
marble roll.
Now he would receive one and look at it.

1302
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:30,160
If the warning message was one that
would be relevant to him,

1303
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,520
he'd ask for another one until he
received got low birth weight.

1304
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,480
He got low or you don't,
don't drink while pregnant.

1305
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,040
It doesn't apply to me.

1306
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,810
And since I looked at,
I said he was serious.

1307
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,240
But you obviously know Bill Hicks bit,
by the way.

1308
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,770
What does that,
what does Bill Hicks,

1309
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,000
who's one of the greatest comics hour?
There was a bit that he had on exactly

1310
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,170
that point.
Said just,

1311
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:52,390
just pick one that doesn't apply.
Low birth weight.

1312
00:58:52,391 --> 00:58:53,020
Good.
Oh,

1313
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,150
there you go.
Maybe he got it from him.

1314
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,710
But it shows you how,
even though we often have our fully

1315
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:03,850
cognizant objectively about some truth,
uh,

1316
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:07,030
our ability to engage in self deception
is limitless.

1317
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:07,841
Right?
Well,

1318
00:59:07,841 --> 00:59:10,180
it is for some folks.
And I think,

1319
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:10,841
uh,
again,

1320
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:13,770
that goes back to mindfulness.
It goes back to meditation.

1321
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:16,660
It goes back to reflection.
Most people live their lives in a

1322
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:20,140
constant state of momentum.
The momentum of the past constantly

1323
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:23,060
propelling themselves forward,
and they're always adjusting and trying

1324
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:26,030
to make up for all the mistakes that
their past is made.

1325
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,650
They don't live their life in a state
of,

1326
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:29,630
in the now they lived their life in a
state of,

1327
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:30,890
fuck.
Why did I do that?

1328
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:33,050
Now I gotta do this.
You know what I,

1329
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:35,030
you know what I used to come to and I
think,

1330
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:38,720
let me let me know if you feel it too,
because you have young children.

1331
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:43,550
I'm obsessed about first,
for example,

1332
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:46,670
this is the first time that my daughter
did this and they'll never be another

1333
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:49,880
first.
I'm always panicking about them growing

1334
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:50,690
up.
Really?

1335
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,970
Yeah.
I want to sort of weird,

1336
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,130
just it,
there's a purity,

1337
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:55,971
you know,
look,

1338
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:59,150
we live in a world where we're exposed
because we're in the public eye.

1339
00:59:59,151 --> 01:00:02,630
We're exposed to a lot of negativity.
Even though we're exposed to a 100 fold

1340
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:04,280
more positivity,
you know,

1341
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:05,930
it's a,
it's a rough ride out there.

1342
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:11,200
And then my solace is coming home to the
purity and innocence of my children.

1343
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:16,820
And then the reality is that you can't
bottle up that innocence and that purity

1344
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,200
forever.
And so I,

1345
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,320
so speaking of the here and now,
rather than oftentimes just enjoying the

1346
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:23,090
moment,
I'm always worried that,

1347
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:25,240
you know,
in five years she,

1348
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:28,040
she's going to be a prepubescent girl
and then there's going to be a bunch of,

1349
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,030
take this young boys that are gonna come
around.

1350
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,080
So that's something that truly bothers
me.

1351
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,970
Does it doesn't affect you?
I mean,

1352
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,270
I,
I don't dwell on it honestly.

1353
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,730
I mean,
I just try to enjoy every moment I can

1354
01:00:40,731 --> 01:00:43,610
with them and try and enjoy all the
different stage of their life.

1355
01:00:43,611 --> 01:00:44,410
Right.
But,

1356
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,243
uh,
you know,

1357
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,140
I,
I remember what they were like when they

1358
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:50,660
were babies,
when they could barely talk.

1359
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:51,860
And I,
it was,

1360
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,960
I was thinking I could never love
something.

1361
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:55,310
It's a lot,
much as I love them,

1362
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,240
but now I think when I talked to them,
I love them even more because now I get

1363
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:01,190
to have little conversations with
people.

1364
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,960
You know,
when you have like a deep conversation

1365
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:05,690
with an eight year old,
it's pretty intense and it's one of your

1366
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:08,300
child and your daughter.
It's pretty intense,

1367
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:11,330
isn't it?
Humbling when they ask you things that

1368
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:13,880
clearly demonstrates out,
you know,

1369
01:01:13,881 --> 01:01:17,060
little about so many things because they
often will ask you the questions that

1370
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:21,740
are profound and deep.
Why is lightning in that particular

1371
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:24,680
form?
And you try to concoct some story while

1372
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,350
being truthful and then oftentimes they
stump you.

1373
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,520
Right?
Uh,

1374
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:30,110
all right.
Just go to Google man.

1375
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,870
Well it's got a heart to go to Google
while you're driving and having a

1376
01:01:32,871 --> 01:01:35,420
conversation about some,
some observation of that just made,

1377
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,730
but it just shows you again the,
the,

1378
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:42,680
the purity of the child and sort of
looking at the world and hitting you

1379
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:44,720
with questions that you frankly can't
answer.

1380
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,700
Well I always like to say that I can't
answer it.

1381
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:50,140
I think it's important to let kids know
that you don't know everything.

1382
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:50,841
Right.
You know,

1383
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:55,310
cause I think children automatically
look towards adults as being some sort

1384
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,650
of superior form of a child.
You know,

1385
01:01:57,651 --> 01:01:58,251
like the,
well,

1386
01:01:58,251 --> 01:01:59,720
I don't know anything,
but I'm a little kid,

1387
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:01,800
but my dad will know.
And then you know,

1388
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,200
if you let them know like,
Hey,

1389
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:05,660
there's just way too much information
for everyone to know.

1390
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:08,150
But what's important is you're honest
about what you do now.

1391
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,970
Yes.
And we were very fortunate that we have

1392
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:15,410
this thing called the Internet so we can
find out what it is that we're trying to

1393
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:17,180
give them the answer for.
And incidentally,

1394
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:21,690
I do that with my one.
They ask a question and let's see.

1395
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:23,640
I don't know the answer.
I'm very open.

1396
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:24,474
I said,
you know what?

1397
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,530
I think you've gone with this one.

1398
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,191
Yeah,
good for you.

1399
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:27,960
Why don't you send me an email,
remind me.

1400
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:29,260
And I'll look into it.
And,

1401
01:02:29,261 --> 01:02:32,460
and I do it just naturally,
but oftentimes they'll write back to me

1402
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,080
and say,
you know why that was so refreshing?

1403
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,690
But you know,
you are humble enough to not pretend

1404
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:38,640
that you know everything about every
single thing.

1405
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:39,474
You know,
I,

1406
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,500
yeah,
I love that.

1407
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:42,970
And it's so frustrating when you're
talking to someone who was really smart,

1408
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,420
who don't,
doesn't want to admit that they don't

1409
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:48,750
know something or wants to deny
something's true when they haven't

1410
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:50,520
researched it.
It's very frustrating.

1411
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,710
I have a friend who's a brilliant guy
who does that.

1412
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:54,450
He just,
you'll bring something up and he's like,

1413
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:55,410
that's not true.
And you're like,

1414
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,450
oh Jesus fucking Christ.
We just google it.

1415
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:59,610
Right?
And I've done it with him over and over

1416
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:00,240
and over again.

1417
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,800
I had to have a conversation with them.
I said,

1418
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:03,150
listen man,
if I tell you something,

1419
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:03,820
it's true.
It's,

1420
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,660
I'm not making it up.
And if I'm wrong,

1421
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,520
it's a,
it's an honest mistake.

1422
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,890
But if you just google it,
then you'll know.

1423
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:12,930
But you're,
you're saying it's not true and you've

1424
01:03:12,931 --> 01:03:17,460
never even looked at it.
But here we are in 2016 give a fucking,

1425
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,850
you have a device in your pocket.
We can get the answer to virtually

1426
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:22,120
anything at anytime.
Oh,

1427
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,840
shit is out the window.
So what's the psychological trait?

1428
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:25,710
Ego.
Ego.

1429
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:29,070
He's a very smart guy and he wants to be
the smartest guy in the room all the

1430
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:32,070
time.
And so it just gets really frustrating,

1431
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,980
especially if we're somewhere with,
there's no Internet service.

1432
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,810
You're like,
we're going to get to Internet service

1433
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,520
motherfucker,
and then you're gonna apologize.

1434
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,391
It's,
it's,

1435
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:41,340
it's this thing that people do where
they,

1436
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,290
uh,
when you're having a conversation with

1437
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:45,450
someone,
they're not just talking to you.

1438
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,490
They're engaged in a contest.
Yes.

1439
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,110
Oh yeah.
Men Do that.

1440
01:03:49,111 --> 01:03:51,480
All that.
I have several of those in my own,

1441
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,910
uh,
and not nuclear family,

1442
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:57,630
but my family of procreation,
so might brutal and say who but brutal.

1443
01:03:57,631 --> 01:03:58,410
Right?
And,

1444
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:02,310
and here's another thing that you'd
never admit that you're wrong,

1445
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,890
right,
because admitting that you're wrong

1446
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,870
makes you lose face.
And that's such a detrimental dynamic to

1447
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:10,704
have.
Right?

1448
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:11,850
I mean,
you know,

1449
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:13,340
I might come home at night and,
um,

1450
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,370
I've had a tough day and I might respond
curtly to my dog.

1451
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:19,920
I actually,
we'll go back and then hug my dog

1452
01:04:19,921 --> 01:04:23,370
because I have enough self awareness to
realize that I didn't give her enough

1453
01:04:23,371 --> 01:04:24,090
attention.
Right.

1454
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:27,480
So I have enough humility to nevermind,
you know,

1455
01:04:27,481 --> 01:04:29,910
another human.
My dog is just as important to me and if

1456
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:33,150
I responded curtly I will sort of
apologize to her yet I haven't got

1457
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:34,140
family members.

1458
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,190
Uh,
again,

1459
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:38,160
this is not my family of my wife or
kids,

1460
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:43,320
but the family that I was born into that
have never apologized about anything

1461
01:04:43,321 --> 01:04:48,321
because they come from a cultural
landscape where to apologize to your

1462
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:51,210
child,
to somebody younger is to lose face at

1463
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:54,840
parent is always right.
And I mean that might work when you're

1464
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:57,420
too,
but when you're both now adults,

1465
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,910
I think you sort of have to get out of
that and realize that we all make

1466
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:01,680
mistakes and we all have to own up to
them.

1467
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,320
We all have to apologize,
honesty when we make a mistake.

1468
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:08,190
And yet some people it's super unhealthy
and it's unhealthy for the person who

1469
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:11,040
doesn't admit they make the mistake too
because then it puts you in this

1470
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,950
position of being in denial of what you
know to be the truth,

1471
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,930
right?
You're going to run around pretending

1472
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,070
that you were right all when you know in

1473
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,370
your head that you were wrong.
So it diminishes your own personal

1474
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:23,100
opinions about yourself,
right?

1475
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:26,170
You're not sorry.
Ready on this exact point.

1476
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:28,480
Okay.
So I'm having a chat with a family

1477
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:31,130
member,
an older family member of mine for my

1478
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,730
family as the problem person.
This is,

1479
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,030
this is one of the key problem for
people in with my family.

1480
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,160
And we,
uh,

1481
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,960
he says something to the effect of,
Oh,

1482
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:42,280
you know,
those ancient Greeks,

1483
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,890
uh,
those Christians were really,

1484
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,920
uh,
antisemetic where I come up with these

1485
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:47,950
details.
I said,

1486
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:48,311
oh,
well,

1487
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:48,950
you know,
I'm,

1488
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,260
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to correct you,

1489
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:51,094
but,
uh,

1490
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,250
those ancient Greeks were not Christian.
As a matter of fact,

1491
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:58,330
the way we mark that eras,
we say bce before common era or BC

1492
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:00,490
before Christ.
So by definition,

1493
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,180
those guys were marked as not being
Christian.

1494
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,860
So when he's now faced with sort of
historical evidence that suggested he

1495
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:10,720
was wrong,
what do you think he does?

1496
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,300
It's,
it's so grotesque that I'm not even sure

1497
01:06:13,301 --> 01:06:15,880
you can guess what he did.
I don't want to guess.

1498
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,650
So he basically says no,
that's right.

1499
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:20,050
That's what I said.
I said that they weren't Christian and

1500
01:06:20,051 --> 01:06:23,260
you said that they were Christian,
so he looks at you in the face.

1501
01:06:23,261 --> 01:06:24,041
That's,
that's called,

1502
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,990
if I,
if you don't mind me saying on air,

1503
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,810
that's mind fucking right.
He looks at you in the face.

1504
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,580
He knows that,
you know,

1505
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,120
but he has enough in Arabic.
You say what?

1506
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:36,490
Ha it's the,
it's this kind of pathological pride.

1507
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:37,900
Right.
Fuck you.

1508
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,460
Right.
I'm going to look at you.

1509
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,080
Right.
So rather than saying,

1510
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,400
Oh gee,
I didn't know that.

1511
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:46,420
Thanks for correcting me.
He flips what our original points of

1512
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,380
disagreement was
there.

1513
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,850
You can talk to that dude.
You've got to cut that guy loose.

1514
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,440
Well,
maybe I have,

1515
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,780
oh,
maybe have molly can I said that.

1516
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:57,670
Yeah,
that's a,

1517
01:06:57,671 --> 01:07:00,310
that's an unfortunate characteristic in
men.

1518
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,590
Uh,
I guess it probably exists in women too,

1519
01:07:02,591 --> 01:07:04,430
but I see it more in men,
uh,

1520
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,370
that they will,
they'll always want to be right,

1521
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,060
right.
You know,

1522
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,690
but it doesn't make you better to have
information that someone doesn't have.

1523
01:07:10,691 --> 01:07:13,060
Like I like when someone can tell me
something that I don't know.

1524
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,440
Sure.
It's interesting.

1525
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:19,210
I suspect that one of the reasons why
your podcast is so successful is because

1526
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:23,320
you exhibit that generosity.
If you came to the,

1527
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,350
to every discussion thinking that there
is nothing that the other person could

1528
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:28,300
bring to the table,
you're not going to have a show that's

1529
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:30,070
going to last long though.
Well that's also,

1530
01:07:30,071 --> 01:07:34,480
it's impossible says we're not talking
about like the 1950s when people at this

1531
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:38,140
narrow view of the world,
it was defined by their own environment,

1532
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:38,620
right?

1533
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:43,480
We're talking about this broad place now
where you can just access all sorts of

1534
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:45,430
data.
And one of the beautiful things about

1535
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:49,480
the podcast is by sitting down with
people like you or all the other awesome

1536
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:54,310
guests I get to sit down with,
I get to experience the wisdom and the

1537
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:57,130
information of someone who's lived a
completely different life than me.

1538
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:02,550
And I just find that really fascinating.
And I just think that that arrogance

1539
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:07,750
that someone would display by doing what
that guy did to you and switching around

1540
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:08,590
your,
your points.

1541
01:08:08,591 --> 01:08:13,591
And just that's just a child that's like
a developmental dead end that this

1542
01:08:13,901 --> 01:08:16,760
person went down still.
So unhealthy.

1543
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:18,500
I hear you.
But so common,

1544
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:19,550
right?
So common.

1545
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,380
Yeah.
What's next?

1546
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,810
What do want to talk about?
I want to talk about your paper that you

1547
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:25,130
brought up.
Oh yeah,

1548
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:27,620
sure.
So this is a paper that uh,

1549
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:32,150
I was invited to write and one of the
leading journals in the field general

1550
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:33,800
marketing research,
uh,

1551
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:38,540
where I was asked to talk about the
methods of evolutionary psychology,

1552
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,240
how evolutionary psychologists conduct
research.

1553
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:46,750
And it was specifically to address some
of the common canards that we hear from

1554
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:48,620
the tractors of evolution psychology.
Oh,

1555
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:50,930
it's all a bunch of post hoc
storytelling and so on.

1556
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,970
And so the paper basically looks at
three points,

1557
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:54,530
two of which we've already sort of
covered.

1558
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:57,830
One is the distinction between proximate
and ultimate explanations.

1559
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,290
And again,
that's a very important point to make

1560
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:04,400
because it basically argues that you'll
never have a full explanation of any

1561
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:08,480
phenomenon involving biological agents
if you don't study the phenomenon at

1562
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:11,930
both the proximate and ultimate level,
approximately how,

1563
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:15,350
what ultimate is the Darwinian wise.
That's one we've already covered that

1564
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:18,980
one.
The second method of evolution

1565
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:22,400
psychology is the building of these
networks of cumulative evidence.

1566
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:25,010
Like the one I gave you with the waist
to hip ratio.

1567
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,830
Uh,
maybe I'll give you another one as an

1568
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,410
example of this mechanism.

1569
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:34,610
So for example,
if I want to argue that toy preferences

1570
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,970
have sex specificity,
that is innate,

1571
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,370
right?
So it's not that cause typically in the

1572
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:43,490
social sciences we,
we hear that what makes little boys,

1573
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:45,020
little boys and little girls,
little girls,

1574
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:48,830
little girls,
is that boys are taught to play rough

1575
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:51,380
with the GI.
Joe Girls are taught to play gentle with

1576
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:53,330
the pink thought.
But that's dismissed.

1577
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:53,791
I mean,
you,

1578
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,680
you,
you hear that,

1579
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:57,320
but it's a very fringe in the social
sciences.

1580
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:57,891
It isn't,
it,

1581
01:09:57,891 --> 01:09:59,510
it's,
it's still up there.

1582
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:02,240
Well,
it's only because of liberal colleges.

1583
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:04,190
It's not because of a,
it's,

1584
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,820
it's not people that are objectively
intelligent that are recognizing us,

1585
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:12,080
but certainly in terms of the university
landscape that is the dominant,

1586
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:13,310
uh,
navigate.

1587
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:17,150
What are they uses evidence to point
that men are taught to that because

1588
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:22,450
they've proven that children absolutely
gravitate just based on gender gravitate

1589
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:25,670
towards certain types of tasks and toys.

1590
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,280
So that's what I'm going to do next is
I'm going to demonstrate how

1591
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:32,150
evolutionary psychologists build these
numb logical networks of keen wealth of

1592
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:34,940
evidence.
So if I want it to prove that that

1593
01:10:34,941 --> 01:10:38,420
premise that you argued is dismissed is
truly laughable,

1594
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:40,760
how would I go about them?
And so that's one of the things that I

1595
01:10:40,761 --> 01:10:44,480
did in the paper.
So we could look at children who are in

1596
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:47,450
the pre socialization stage of their
cognitive development,

1597
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:51,440
meaning that by definition they're too
young to have been socialized and we

1598
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:53,800
could do studies on them to see what is
it that the,

1599
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:55,310
that that they,
you know,

1600
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:58,580
approach first or what is it that they
gaze at longer.

1601
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:02,480
And we see that there is a sex
specificity in such young children.

1602
01:11:02,481 --> 01:11:05,960
So already it demonstrates that it's
probably not due to socialization.

1603
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:10,961
So that's evidence line number one.
We could take other species vervet

1604
01:11:11,331 --> 01:11:14,070
monkeys and rhesus monkeys.
And now there's some research

1605
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,450
with chimps showing that they exhibit
the same sex specificity.

1606
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,930
Would these types of toys as human
infants do?

1607
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:27,390
They done number two,
we could take data from a clinical

1608
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:29,310
population.
So there's a this order known as

1609
01:11:29,311 --> 01:11:33,150
congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
which is an endocrinological problem

1610
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:36,990
that masculinized as little girls that
masculinized his little girls,

1611
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:39,330
both in their morphology but also in
their behaviors.

1612
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,180
So if you take little girls who suffer
from this disorder,

1613
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,250
what do you think happens in their toy
preferences?

1614
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,860
They become more like those of little
boys.

1615
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:51,360
We could take a depictions on funerary
monuments,

1616
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:51,990
uh,
you know,

1617
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:54,740
these big mausoleums of that people,
uh,

1618
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,870
from ancient Greece.
And you look at depictions of little

1619
01:11:57,871 --> 01:12:00,840
boys and little girls and you'll see
that the little boys are depicted with

1620
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:02,190
the typical toys,
you know,

1621
01:12:02,191 --> 01:12:02,941
with a ball,
with a,

1622
01:12:02,941 --> 01:12:04,080
something with a wheel thing.

1623
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,590
Little girls are depicted with dolls.
You could do the studies across a wide

1624
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:10,740
range of cultures that are very
different from western cultures.

1625
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,100
The phenomenon manifests itself again.
And so what you do,

1626
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:17,850
again in evolutionary theory is you
build this normal,

1627
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,120
normal logical network of cumulative
evidence coming from completely

1628
01:12:21,121 --> 01:12:25,860
different data sets that then makes it
unassailable to argue against it.

1629
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,590
So that's the second method of evolution
psychology.

1630
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,180
The third one I argue is a evolutionary
psychology operates on what are,

1631
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:36,480
what are called consilience trees of
knowledge.

1632
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:40,290
Consilience is a term that had sort of
lost its way.

1633
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,390
It basically refers to unity of
knowledge.

1634
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:45,540
So if you say for example,
physics is more conciliatory than

1635
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:48,810
sociology,
it's because physics has these organize

1636
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:52,980
knowledge trees that sociology doesn't,
okay,

1637
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,010
so what is a typical tree of knowledge
and evolutionary theory?

1638
01:12:56,011 --> 01:12:58,320
So you could start with something like
sexual selection.

1639
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,470
Sexual selection is basically the idea
that how do,

1640
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,510
how does a peacock evolve?
It's a big tail.

1641
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:06,600
So,
so how do animals evolve their traits to

1642
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:10,290
give them reproductive advantage?
That's been established from the time of

1643
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:12,450
Darwin through a million different
species.

1644
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:16,230
So now that leads to down the tree to
another theory.

1645
01:13:16,231 --> 01:13:18,840
It's called the mid level theory called
parental investment theory.

1646
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,380
Parental investment theory basically
says that if you want to know about sex

1647
01:13:22,381 --> 01:13:25,080
differences within a species,
look at the minimal,

1648
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:29,100
I would look at Dory parental investment
that each sex has to have in that

1649
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:32,550
species.
So in most species it's the female that

1650
01:13:32,551 --> 01:13:35,670
has more parental investment.
So typically they're smaller.

1651
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,730
It's the males who fight for access to
females.

1652
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,520
Females are more careful about the May
choices they make.

1653
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:45,750
But you also have sex role reversal
species where it's as the males who have

1654
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:46,920
greater parental investment.

1655
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:49,110
What do you think happens to the sex
differences there?

1656
01:13:49,111 --> 01:13:50,610
Exactly reversed,
right?

1657
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:53,490
So that has been also established.
So now we go down.

1658
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,110
Parental investment theory leads to
another theory that basically says that

1659
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:03,660
in the human context females will make
more judicious may choices than men.

1660
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,360
In other words,
women are more careful and the types of

1661
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:10,800
make choices that they must make
precisely because they have greater

1662
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:13,870
costs if they make a wrong may think
choice,

1663
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:18,310
which leads to a study that I did.
Looking at how much information the men

1664
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:22,240
and women look at before they either
reject mates or choose mates.

1665
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,840
And what do you think the results shows
when it comes to rejecting mates?

1666
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,420
Women need less convincing.
In other words,

1667
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:31,060
they,
they acquire less information before

1668
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:34,210
they decide all these mates are losers.
On the other hand,

1669
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:38,920
when it comes to choosing a mate,
women look at more information prior to

1670
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:39,610
choosing.

1671
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:43,570
So what I've shown you here is how you
start with a general principle and work

1672
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:48,400
down a tree to a specific hypothesis.
That's called a tree of knowledge of

1673
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:51,250
evolutionary theory.
That's what the method of evolutionary

1674
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:55,510
psychology is.
So contrary to what typical the

1675
01:14:55,511 --> 01:14:56,890
tractors,
there'll be some buffoon,

1676
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:58,550
some customer data on your,
uh,

1677
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,340
at the bottom of your comments section
that says,

1678
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:03,600
but evolutionary sciences,
that's not a real solid mckinnis

1679
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:04,780
toronto.
Right?

1680
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:06,550
Okay.
So that's hilarious.

1681
01:15:06,551 --> 01:15:07,121
Yeah,
you liked that,

1682
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:10,210
huh?
That's the turn out of that is good.

1683
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,760
Uh,
singers and other balls chopped off.

1684
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,020
I usually call him the Castrati brigade
and of course in the singular form,

1685
01:15:17,021 --> 01:15:17,920
that's gus throttle,
right?

1686
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:20,520
So it's a guy who walks around without
testes,

1687
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:23,230
but a very inflated ego who then tells
you,

1688
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:25,150
you know,
despite the fact that you've spent 20

1689
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:27,370
plus years studying something,
he knows more than you.

1690
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:29,620
All of you evolutionary scientists are
full in order.

1691
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:30,890
Well,
it's,

1692
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:35,510
it's interesting to me that there would
be people that would be involved in

1693
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:40,511
universities that would debate this sort
of very objective research.

1694
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:43,640
Right?
Right.

1695
01:15:43,641 --> 01:15:45,450
I mean,
especially when it comes to gender and

1696
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,930
obviously there's variables,
but when it comes to the,

1697
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,980
the gravitating towards certain types of
toys and tasks and,

1698
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,100
and then it also pertains to career
choices as well.

1699
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,390
Like there's this big push to get women
involved in stem and women involved in

1700
01:15:59,391 --> 01:16:01,880
technology and other th there's
discrimination.

1701
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:02,714
Women in tech,
well,

1702
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,880
no,
w women don't gravitate towards those

1703
01:16:04,881 --> 01:16:06,830
particular jobs.
They don't want to do them.

1704
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:08,660
Some do.
And the ones that do,

1705
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:11,720
they cry sexism because there's so few
of them.

1706
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:12,890
Well,
there's just no,

1707
01:16:12,891 --> 01:16:16,130
it's just not something that they
naturally gravitate towards.

1708
01:16:16,131 --> 01:16:16,964
Overwhelming.

1709
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:17,770
Well,
that's what,

1710
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:21,310
I don't know if you remember the,
the whole debacle with Larry Summers,

1711
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,690
who was the president of Harvard
University who then became,

1712
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:27,550
I don't know if he was in the Obama
administration,

1713
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:30,340
but here's this guy who was president of
Harvard University.

1714
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:33,580
He was giving a speech,
probably Jamie can pull it up if he has

1715
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:34,540
time.
Uh,

1716
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:40,140
and he was basically giving a talk where
he hinted to exactly what you said.

1717
01:16:40,241 --> 01:16:41,830
He said that he didn't say,
Oh,

1718
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,440
you know,
women don't have the capacity to get

1719
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:45,490
into these fields.
Right.

1720
01:16:45,491 --> 01:16:49,000
I think he hinted to exactly what your
sensitive then they might not like it as

1721
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:51,280
much.
Despite these very aggressive programs

1722
01:16:51,281 --> 01:16:53,530
that we've instituted to try to attract
women,

1723
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,760
maybe they're not drunk,
just hinting at that led him to

1724
01:16:57,761 --> 01:17:01,150
eventually stepping down as president of
Harvard.

1725
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,510
It's a real problem in colleges and
universities today with that,

1726
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:08,230
with this denial of reality to her to
help other people's feelings,

1727
01:17:08,231 --> 01:17:10,490
where to make other,
but to placate other people's feelings.

1728
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,260
And it's also this repeating that even
Obama has been involved in repeating

1729
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:20,070
this myth that women working the same
job make 77 cents for every dollar that

1730
01:17:20,071 --> 01:17:22,070
a man makes.
That's not true.

1731
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,350
I don't know if you've ever researched
that or gone into that.

1732
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,820
So I know,
I know from two sources,

1733
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:28,220
the only two sources that I've sort of
paid attention to that have addressed

1734
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:30,740
this.
I think as Milo Yiannopoulos,

1735
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:33,290
who's sort of been one of the big
champions to try to dismantle that

1736
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:34,460
narrative.
Well it's just,

1737
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:37,730
it's been dismantled by sociologists,
has been dismantled.

1738
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:38,840
Dena hoff summers.
Yeah.

1739
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,220
Did it so,
so,

1740
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:40,491
yeah.
Yeah,

1741
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:41,660
I think you're exactly right.
Well,

1742
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:43,670
the,
the data is wrong.

1743
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:45,770
I mean it's,
it's totally misinterpreted.

1744
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:49,820
The real data is when you look at the
overall wealth,

1745
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:52,430
like what men make versus what women
make.

1746
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,850
Men make more money,
but they also work more hours.

1747
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:59,660
They also choose different jobs.
They also are at a higher risk to die on

1748
01:17:59,661 --> 01:18:01,460
the job.
There's all of these different factors.

1749
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:05,780
The misconception is that a man and a
woman working side by side doing the

1750
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:09,050
same job that the woman is making 77
cents to the man's dollar.

1751
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:10,940
That is not true.
Exactly right.

1752
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:13,460
And that's the problem with this thing.
And even fucking Obama,

1753
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,310
he,
he parroted that and Sarah Silverman did

1754
01:18:16,311 --> 01:18:17,510
it recently,
one of those,

1755
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:20,030
Hillary Clinton's speech is talking
about how women make less than men.

1756
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:21,680
It's not true.
Right?

1757
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:25,640
But it's one of those things that if you
tell people they don't believe you,

1758
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,220
like you have to,
you have to send them studies and then

1759
01:18:28,221 --> 01:18:31,430
they read it and you're like,
we have this myth has been perpetrated

1760
01:18:31,431 --> 01:18:33,200
so pervasively.

1761
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,490
It's so common that people parrot it and
no one questions it.

1762
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:42,670
The fucking president parrots it on
television like intellectually that is

1763
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:46,010
so incredibly dishonest for him to do
that.

1764
01:18:46,011 --> 01:18:50,030
If he is aware of the actual stats and
he says that just because he knows

1765
01:18:50,031 --> 01:18:51,770
that's what people want to hear.
Like,

1766
01:18:51,771 --> 01:18:53,390
oh,
Obama does care.

1767
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:56,450
He is,
he's caring and sympathetic and he's not

1768
01:18:56,451 --> 01:18:57,580
a pig.
I mean,

1769
01:18:57,581 --> 01:19:01,160
similar narrative has been proposed and
you could probably could fill in the

1770
01:19:01,161 --> 01:19:03,620
details regarding the,
I don't know what the number is.

1771
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:07,820
You know,
one in five women on university campuses

1772
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:12,800
will experience a sexual assault.
That is a ridiculous stat that is,

1773
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:17,870
I don't know that that's not the ice did
define sexual assault.

1774
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:22,490
If it's a guy making an an an unwanted
grope,

1775
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,700
you know that a guy moves in for a kiss
when he doesn't,

1776
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:27,320
I mean,
I think you're dealing with a lot of

1777
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:28,460
awkward kids.

1778
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:32,690
They're drunk and they do stupid shit
and some of it easily could be sexual

1779
01:19:32,691 --> 01:19:35,150
assault or sexual,
you know,

1780
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,660
in propriety.
I,

1781
01:19:36,661 --> 01:19:38,720
I don't,
I don't necessarily think that that

1782
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,440
number's off so that I think rape is
much more,

1783
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,350
much more complicated.
I mean that then I think you're talking

1784
01:19:45,351 --> 01:19:47,570
about something way,
way more.

1785
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:51,260
I'm way less common,
but way more disturbing.

1786
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,140
And uh,
I think the,

1787
01:19:53,141 --> 01:19:57,950
the real re the real statistics about
how many women get raped or I'm way

1788
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:01,880
different than what is being proposed.
The problem is you start talking about

1789
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:06,650
things like an unwanted grope or someone
slapping someone in the ass that that

1790
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:07,830
all gets factored in.

1791
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,060
Then they start factoring in things like
having sex while intoxicated and that

1792
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:17,061
becomes sexual assault.
But conveniently only for the man to be

1793
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:22,461
the one who's the sexual assault or like
if a woman is sober in the man is drunk,

1794
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:27,090
no one has ever accusing the woman of
being a rapist by having sex with a

1795
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:28,260
drunk man.
Right.

1796
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,160
Have we talked,
uh,

1797
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:31,410
speaking of very private,
I'm not sure if we've discussed it on

1798
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:32,790
the show,
that'd be discussed,

1799
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:36,450
the rape by fraud story of this show.
Yes,

1800
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:39,210
we have.
Well there's also the new laws that are

1801
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:42,180
being passed rate by fraud,
which is a fascinating,

1802
01:20:42,181 --> 01:20:44,220
like if a guy says he's a prince and you
know,

1803
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:48,030
I'm going to take you to my council,
you will live in luxury forever.

1804
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,620
Right.
But he's really not a prince.

1805
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:52,710
That guy can get charged with rape.
What are your thoughts on that?

1806
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,110
Well,
the guy's a piece of shit.

1807
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,560
So Amal be arrested as a rapist?
Well,

1808
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,300
no,
but he is definitely a liar.

1809
01:21:00,301 --> 01:21:00,731
It's,
it's,

1810
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:03,900
it's really tricky.
It's like what is he doing exactly?

1811
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,970
Uh,
he's being a liar.

1812
01:21:05,971 --> 01:21:09,000
He's telling a story that's not true.
And because of that,

1813
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:11,250
of girls having sex with him,
he's immortal.

1814
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,830
He's unethical.
It's reprehensible behavior.

1815
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,410
He's not criminal.
Criminal.

1816
01:21:16,411 --> 01:21:19,230
Because if that were criminal,
as I think I might've mentioned on your

1817
01:21:19,231 --> 01:21:23,010
show before,
95% of people who are engaged in online

1818
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:24,630
dating are rapists.
Well,

1819
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:25,300
yeah,
that's,

1820
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,570
that's true.
And also a lot of guys will lie to

1821
01:21:27,571 --> 01:21:28,950
themselves,
the raping themselves,

1822
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,040
you know,
pretending they really loved that one.

1823
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:33,510
When I tell it now,
musterbation is raping yourself even

1824
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:34,920
mean masturbation.
I mean,

1825
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:36,160
having sex with someone,
you don't really,

1826
01:21:36,161 --> 01:21:38,760
you're not really attracted.
You just horny as fuck and you convince

1827
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:39,880
yourself this is the right girl.

1828
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:41,430
And then as soon as your orgasm,
you're like,

1829
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,160
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
I just wrote myself.

1830
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,510
Um,
I think,

1831
01:21:45,511 --> 01:21:48,090
um,
there's something immoral about it.

1832
01:21:48,091 --> 01:21:50,130
There's something unethical about it,
but it,

1833
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:54,420
it becomes very tricky when you try to
decide whether or not that's a crime.

1834
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,280
Right?
Or you want to prosecute someone for

1835
01:21:56,281 --> 01:21:57,570
rape,
for doing something like that.

1836
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:02,520
Also,
it's weird because presumably the woman

1837
01:22:02,521 --> 01:22:04,350
had sex with that man,
uh,

1838
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:09,000
voluntarily and enjoyed it and then
decided she didn't enjoy it when she

1839
01:22:09,001 --> 01:22:12,780
realized that guy was crazy or a liar.
Isn't that just like a lesson?

1840
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:16,680
Like isn't that just a life lesson and
now you're going to go and be way more

1841
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,480
picky with who you decide to have sex
with?

1842
01:22:18,481 --> 01:22:18,901
Well,
I mean,

1843
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:19,890
think of it this way.
I mean,

1844
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:21,870
again,
let's link it back to evolutionary

1845
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:24,300
theory,
not just in the human context,

1846
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:26,010
but across the animal kingdom.

1847
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:28,930
There's endless manifestations of the
set of signaling,

1848
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:30,200
right?
Sure.

1849
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:34,020
Animals including engage in deceptive
signaling,

1850
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:34,740
right?
I mean,

1851
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,680
he's an example that doesn't relate to
me thing.

1852
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:38,580
Uh,
apple somatic colorings,

1853
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,620
which is basically warning colors,
right?

1854
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:45,180
So you have a species of say,
Amazonian frog that has very vivid

1855
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:46,200
colors.
Why?

1856
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:47,520
Why would it be vivid?
Well,

1857
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:49,470
because it is advertising to everybody.
Hey,

1858
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,360
don't approach me.
I'm very venomous.

1859
01:22:51,361 --> 01:22:53,610
Right?
Well then there'll be another species of

1860
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:58,611
frog that piggybacks on that coloring.
That actually itself is not at all

1861
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:03,710
venomous but yet because it is a Serp,
this signal now nobody will attack it,

1862
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,590
right?
Oh boy.

1863
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:06,040
What a,
what

1864
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,940
a fraud.
What it right.

1865
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:08,110
So,
so the idea,

1866
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:11,770
and again I don't want to receive
comments now that I support lying and so

1867
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:14,110
it is reprehensible.
It is unethical,

1868
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,500
it is immoral.
I don't do the behavior of course,

1869
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:20,830
but it's part of life.
People lie to one another.

1870
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:23,160
People lie to themselves.
I think I might've mentioned on this

1871
01:23:23,161 --> 01:23:25,090
show before and even if I have,
it's,

1872
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,620
it's worth repeating.
Uh,

1873
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:29,440
there's a gentleman,
a very famous biologist by the name of

1874
01:23:29,441 --> 01:23:32,170
Robert trevors.
We've talked about the evolutionary

1875
01:23:32,171 --> 01:23:33,880
roots of self deception,
right?

1876
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:38,830
Why is it that we deceive ourselves?
And then the argument there is that the

1877
01:23:38,831 --> 01:23:43,180
reason why I have to first believe in
the lie before selling it to you is

1878
01:23:43,181 --> 01:23:46,990
because when I lie,
I actually have these micro expressions

1879
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,870
that serve as tale tale signs of my
line.

1880
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:53,620
If I could suppress these so that when
you're trying to look at my face to see

1881
01:23:53,621 --> 01:23:56,410
if there are any signatures of deception
on my face,

1882
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,110
you won't read them because I've already
lied to myself.

1883
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:03,370
And so they are even clear evolutionary
adaptive reasons for why we lie to

1884
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,350
ourselves,
nevermind lying to others.

1885
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:10,620
So lying and deception is part of the
large repertoire of human behaviors.

1886
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,190
And to call somebody a rapist for
engaging in that represents that we'd

1887
01:24:14,191 --> 01:24:16,390
behavior it does nobody any good.
Hmm.

1888
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:21,190
That's interesting.
Now deception also has to be defined

1889
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:25,900
like lying and rape by deception.
Like at what level are we still calling

1890
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:28,930
it rape by deception?
Like if a guy has a fake rolex on,

1891
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:29,890
right?
Like,

1892
01:24:29,891 --> 01:24:32,980
and he's advertising that he's wealthy
when in fact he's not,

1893
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:36,460
I mean,
when a guy pretends he's making $100,000

1894
01:24:36,461 --> 01:24:39,040
a year,
but it really makes 45 let's make it

1895
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,480
less fun.
Let's make it more fuzzy.

1896
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:43,510
Okay.
How about if I am actually a very,

1897
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:47,560
uh,
apathetic guy who can't get out of bed

1898
01:24:47,561 --> 01:24:51,820
till 11 o'clock in the morning,
but yet I convince whomever I'm going

1899
01:24:51,821 --> 01:24:55,420
out with that I have this infinite
bottled up ambition.

1900
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,080
So not even faking the Rolex watch,
this is not a tangible thing.

1901
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:03,610
I'm just sending her cues that I'm going
places that all great ideas.

1902
01:25:03,611 --> 01:25:07,150
I've got a lot of entrepreneurial spunk
and my workout every day.

1903
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:10,980
I worked with drink wheat grass.
I'm super healthy or meditate and soda

1904
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,280
my rapist.
Yeah,

1905
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,710
that's a good question.
Like who are you?

1906
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,720
You know,
I always tell guys,

1907
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:19,210
you should aspire to be the man you
pretend to be when you're trying to get

1908
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:21,280
laid.
Like if you could just do they just be

1909
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:23,560
that guy all the time.
Like you don't really,

1910
01:25:23,561 --> 01:25:24,970
it's the best way to go.
Right?

1911
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,170
Uh,
but yeah,

1912
01:25:26,171 --> 01:25:27,170
that is a,
that's interesting.

1913
01:25:27,171 --> 01:25:28,720
Like that is deceptive,
right?

1914
01:25:28,721 --> 01:25:30,790
If he's pretending to have all this
really,

1915
01:25:30,791 --> 01:25:32,440
uh,
admirable behavior,

1916
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,240
one on one fakes orgasm and makes you
think that you're a great lover and you

1917
01:25:37,241 --> 01:25:39,650
have sex with her,
she's alive.

1918
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,980
She raped me.
So then I had sex with her.

1919
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:46,030
It was under the misconception that I
was a great love of the first time when

1920
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:48,640
she faked an orgasm.
So she's raping me that second time.

1921
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:51,220
Now when you were talking about
evolutionary psychology,

1922
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:53,610
receiving a lot of criticism,
what,

1923
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,640
what is it?
What is this?

1924
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:56,860
You and you,
you sort of glossed over it real quickly

1925
01:25:56,861 --> 01:25:59,230
to make your point.
Like where's the,

1926
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:01,390
where's the vast majority of this coming
from?

1927
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,470
Yeah,
that's a great question.

1928
01:26:02,471 --> 01:26:03,860
So it comes from

1929
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:06,590
different camps for different reasons,
right?

1930
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,640
So you,
so let's start,

1931
01:26:07,641 --> 01:26:09,050
let's kind of break them up.
Okay.

1932
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,290
So we can go to the religious folks,
right?

1933
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,980
I mean that's obvious though,
isn't it obvious that they would be the

1934
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:18,470
track?
Obviously they're not going to look at

1935
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:20,150
things realistically because they have
this,

1936
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:23,660
that blind spot.
Let's talk about like professors,

1937
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:26,540
right?
So then the professors typically will be

1938
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,370
one of,
against several types.

1939
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:32,690
They'll be the social constructivists.
Those are the guys who believe that

1940
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:36,410
everything's due to social construction.
That what makes us human is that we

1941
01:26:36,411 --> 01:26:38,180
transcend our biology,
right?

1942
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:39,770
It's an argument for that though,
isn't it?

1943
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,040
Well,
we don't transcend our bile.

1944
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:45,470
We were not strictly biological animals
would biological and cultural,

1945
01:26:45,471 --> 01:26:47,930
but we certainly can't negate our
biology,

1946
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:50,150
right?
What they're basically arguing is that

1947
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:54,680
what differentiates us from all other
life forms is that we transcend our

1948
01:26:54,681 --> 01:26:55,730
biology,
right?

1949
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:58,580
So,
so they're perfectly fine if you use an

1950
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:03,581
evolutionary explanation to explain the
behavior of the mating behavior of the

1951
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:07,310
salamander,
but don't apply that exact same

1952
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:09,200
phenomenon.
What are the flies to humans,

1953
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:11,540
right?
Because somehow we have,

1954
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,410
uh,
you know,

1955
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:15,490
consciousness and we have higher order
thinking and we're called church

1956
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:17,240
culture.
And that's what makes us human,

1957
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:18,171
right?
Uh,

1958
01:27:18,171 --> 01:27:19,610
there are guys who,
for example,

1959
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:23,690
professors who believed that evolution
stops at the neck,

1960
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:26,570
so,
so they're perfectly happy with a,

1961
01:27:26,571 --> 01:27:31,400
you offering an evolutionary explanation
for why we fingernails where we evolve

1962
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,320
opposable thumbs.
That's fine.

1963
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:35,600
Why we've evolved the particular,
uh,

1964
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:40,400
pancreas that we have,
but don't apply it to anything above the

1965
01:27:40,401 --> 01:27:41,520
neck,
not dumbo.

1966
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:44,540
How behavior patterns or cultural
personhood,

1967
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:45,750
who you are as a human being.
Right?

1968
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,593
Right.
Uh,

1969
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:49,390
there are some guys who,
uh,

1970
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:52,610
don't have any ideological reasons for
hating evolution psychology,

1971
01:27:52,611 --> 01:27:54,650
but because they don't know much about
evolution psychology,

1972
01:27:54,651 --> 01:27:56,240
they typically will argue,
oh,

1973
01:27:56,241 --> 01:27:59,300
evolution has come up with all these
fanciful post hoc stories.

1974
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,460
And in a sense,
the article that I wrote that I

1975
01:28:01,461 --> 01:28:04,790
discussed on your show today seeks to
address that.

1976
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:07,790
Then contrary to what people think,
the,

1977
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:11,660
the standard of evidence that
evolutionary scientists typically seek

1978
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:16,661
to meet prior to accepting an
explanation is actually much,

1979
01:28:17,031 --> 01:28:21,860
much higher than other sciences by the
very nature of the epistemology of the

1980
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:24,080
field,
by the very nature of how knowledge is

1981
01:28:24,081 --> 01:28:25,820
created and generated an evolutionary
theory.

1982
01:28:25,821 --> 01:28:28,490
So for all sorts of reasons,
reasons,

1983
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:33,520
none of which is valid,
there's a long queue of frankly buffoons

1984
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:38,780
who despise evolutionary theory.
Now the reality is that they're going to

1985
01:28:38,781 --> 01:28:39,800
lose this battle,
right?

1986
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:45,550
There will be a day when it will become
by now to argue that humans are driven

1987
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:49,250
by evolutionary imperatives.
And I already see it from my own

1988
01:28:49,251 --> 01:28:52,580
scientific career.
If I look at the antipathy that I felt

1989
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:56,630
that I faced 15 years ago versus today,
it's very,

1990
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:57,260
very different.

1991
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:59,630
Right?
The antipathy that I felt from sometimes

1992
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:03,120
the same person,
I could still have emails from somebody

1993
01:29:03,121 --> 01:29:06,750
who wrote me 10 years ago thinking that
my work was full of Shit,

1994
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,930
who's now inviting me to his university
with all sorts of deference.

1995
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:11,760
And so that's the nature of science,
right?

1996
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:14,940
It's auto corrective.
And the reality is the cat's out of the

1997
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:15,930
bag.
We,

1998
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:17,580
everything's evolutionary,
right?

1999
01:29:17,581 --> 01:29:17,911
I mean,
we,

2000
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:20,880
by the way,
we could talk about the range of fields

2001
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:24,360
where evolution has made its way in
fields where you wouldn't typically

2002
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:25,810
think.
So is that something that interests you

2003
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:28,100
that we can talk about that,
but I want to keep going down this road

2004
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:28,943
for a little bit.
Sure.

2005
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:33,510
I find it very fascinating when people
oppose things that seem pretty obvious,

2006
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,460
right?
And not only that,

2007
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:40,260
or unwilling to take into account that
it might not be a case of either or,

2008
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:42,100
but it might be a case of there's a,
uh,

2009
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:47,510
a bunch of combining factors and that
evolution must certainly continue to

2010
01:29:48,451 --> 01:29:48,750
play.

2011
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,960
It's the idea that we've completely
transcended evolution with culture and

2012
01:29:51,961 --> 01:29:54,000
thinking and logic and language.
It's insane.

2013
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:56,310
It doesn't make any sense.
I don't know,

2014
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:58,770
forgive me if I've mentioned this on the
show before,

2015
01:29:58,771 --> 01:29:59,370
but again,
it's,

2016
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:01,350
if I have it's worth repeating.
Uh,

2017
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:04,680
I always talk about the interaction test
framework.

2018
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:07,320
Interaction basically means everything's
interaction.

2019
01:30:07,321 --> 01:30:09,810
Most things aren't traction between our
genes and our environment.

2020
01:30:09,811 --> 01:30:10,260
Right?
Right.

2021
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:13,440
As a matter of fact,
genes get turned on or off as a function

2022
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:15,960
of environmental input,
which is fascinating.

2023
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:18,540
Exactly.
Evolution happens within an environment.

2024
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:23,640
So by its very nature,
evolution itself recognizes the

2025
01:30:23,641 --> 01:30:25,200
importance of the environment,
right?

2026
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:26,310
So any,
any,

2027
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,960
anybody who is,
uh,

2028
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:33,120
who exhibits hatred or rejection of
biology using those types of arguments,

2029
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:36,450
it's simply advertising and they know
very little about biology.

2030
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:40,410
The reality is it's an interaction.
And the example I like to give,

2031
01:30:40,411 --> 01:30:42,540
the metaphor I give is the cake
metaphor.

2032
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,630
If you take the separate ingredients of
a cake,

2033
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:48,590
here's the sugar,
here's the exit as the baking soda,

2034
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,620
whatever,
whatever the parts are,

2035
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:51,840
the butter,
they're separate at first.

2036
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:55,110
Now you bake the cake.
If I then ask you when you have the

2037
01:30:55,111 --> 01:30:59,010
final kick in front of you,
point to the sugar or point to the eggs,

2038
01:30:59,011 --> 01:31:01,170
you can't.
It's an inextricable mix.

2039
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:02,370
Them both.
And that's a very good point.

2040
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,730
That's what we are.
We are in an inextricable mix of our

2041
01:31:05,731 --> 01:31:09,600
genes and our unique environments and
our unique talents and our unique

2042
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:12,930
personhoods.
The problem with much of the social

2043
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:16,230
sciences has been,
and they're losing now by the day,

2044
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:21,500
has been that they've completely
rejected biology as an any way relevant

2045
01:31:22,381 --> 01:31:25,710
and explaining anything,
mating criminality,

2046
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,630
a political choice.
For example,

2047
01:31:27,631 --> 01:31:30,840
there's a field called evolutionary
politics or bio politics,

2048
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:35,400
which tries to infuse evolutionary
theory within political science.

2049
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:36,720
Well,
no kidding.

2050
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,060
I mean what?
What happens when we were making

2051
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:40,860
political choices?
Suddenly our biology,

2052
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:44,490
she's just a matter.
So evolutionary theory is relevant

2053
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:48,450
anywhere that you're studying biological
agents.

2054
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:52,500
So what is the argument against this and
what and why?

2055
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:57,300
How has someone got into a university
level teaching this kind of bullshit?

2056
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:59,950
Right?
So it comes from several sources.

2057
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,350
Uh,
so maybe we could sort of point to a few

2058
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:04,540
of you ever debated anyone about this.
Uh,

2059
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:08,590
and I mean I have in various forms,
not necessarily in a public one on one

2060
01:32:08,591 --> 01:32:10,060
like this,
but I would like to see that,

2061
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:11,410
hook it up,
make it happen.

2062
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,360
I would like to find somebody who
opposes,

2063
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:16,930
you have read their stuff online and
it's infuriating.

2064
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:19,090
It's unopposed.
Like someone who writes a ridiculous

2065
01:32:19,091 --> 01:32:21,040
blog and you know,
you,

2066
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:23,530
you know right away what the motivation
is.

2067
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:28,550
Someone who is distorting reality to fit
their own ridiculous view of the world.

2068
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,510
I mean,
I've debated them and typically one of

2069
01:32:31,511 --> 01:32:35,620
two ways,
either through the review process where

2070
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:38,470
usually they're anonymous and oftentimes
I'm in on this.

2071
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:41,080
So what,
in a double blind review process,

2072
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,270
I don't know who they are,
they don't know who I am,

2073
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,150
and then we're engaging in the debate,
right?

2074
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,280
And oftentimes the paper gets rejected
because they're the reviewer,

2075
01:32:48,281 --> 01:32:50,110
they're the editor,
and then they have the final say.

2076
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:53,260
So in that context of the Beta,
or I've debated publicly,

2077
01:32:53,261 --> 01:32:56,200
typically when I go after somebody on
twitter who is espousing these kinds of

2078
01:32:56,201 --> 01:32:58,150
stupidities,
but I've never done it publicly in this

2079
01:32:58,151 --> 01:32:59,770
way.
Have you had a paper,

2080
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,730
a rejected that was logical and
objective and made a lot of sense?

2081
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:06,280
Tons of times really.
And what like give me an example one.

2082
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:08,550
So the paper when I was talking to you
about the,

2083
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,630
the tree of knowledge going down the
tree sexual selection plan.

2084
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:15,520
So that,
so I had a paper where I had looked at

2085
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:20,410
how much information do men and women
look at before they either reject a mate

2086
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,170
or choose a mate,
which I mentioned earlier,

2087
01:33:22,171 --> 01:33:24,370
right?
That paper originally I had sent it to a

2088
01:33:24,371 --> 01:33:29,371
top journal and consumer psychology and
to kind of just summarize the,

2089
01:33:30,181 --> 01:33:30,851
the thing,
the,

2090
01:33:30,851 --> 01:33:31,750
the,
the position,

2091
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:33,640
it was,
well this is all biology.

2092
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:35,320
What does this have to do with
psychology?

2093
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:40,830
So these very esteemed psychologist
somehow thought that biology existed in

2094
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:47,410
a separate realm to psychology in a
vacuum.

2095
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,050
You're brain exists in this other
parallel.

2096
01:33:50,051 --> 01:33:52,900
His influence,
the body has no influence in the brain

2097
01:33:52,901 --> 01:33:53,734
at all.
Exactly.

2098
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:55,180
The other thing that they were upset
about,

2099
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,060
cause they were talking about,
well why is this person who was an

2100
01:33:58,061 --> 01:34:02,530
otherwise be very patronizing was an
otherwise clearly a bright behavioral

2101
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:07,210
scientists talking about sex differences
when we should be looking at things that

2102
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:09,220
make us similar to one another.

2103
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,990
Well,
when you're talking about sex

2104
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:14,230
differences in mating behavior,
your study sex differences,

2105
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:17,770
right?
I mean it's a fundamental defining

2106
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:20,920
quality of humans that they are sexually
dimorphic.

2107
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:23,080
They are innate differences between men
and women.

2108
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:26,590
So he are people who did not want to
accept that they were sex differences

2109
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:29,170
between men and women.
And they didn't want to accept that

2110
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:33,010
biology has something important to say
about psychology.

2111
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:35,680
Right now.
If I speak to neuroscientists,

2112
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:39,790
if I speak to bio psychologists,
they would listen to my stuff and say,

2113
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:40,690
well yeah,
no kidding.

2114
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:44,080
So,
so in a sense I've existed in a

2115
01:34:44,081 --> 01:34:49,081
fractured life in my academic life.
If I am navigating amongst my natural

2116
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:52,000
science colleagues,
then they're all like,

2117
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:53,710
Oh yeah,
I love your stuff.

2118
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:54,670
You know,
I love you.

2119
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:57,650
If I navigate amongst my social science
friends,

2120
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,040
while they're

2121
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,010
less loving and less receptive,
but they're coming around.

2122
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:04,730
So I think the problem stems from the
empty slate premise,

2123
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:09,950
the idea that we are born with empty
minds that are only subsequently failed

2124
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,670
by a wide range by a cascading number
of,

2125
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:16,520
that's a nonsensical isn't it?
It is.

2126
01:35:16,521 --> 01:35:18,620
But it also,
I have a problem with someone saying,

2127
01:35:18,621 --> 01:35:22,130
why are you looking at this instead of
looking at that?

2128
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:23,570
Right.
Well looking at this,

2129
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,980
it just because you're looking at
something,

2130
01:35:24,981 --> 01:35:29,981
it doesn't make it so that you can't
understand why we were all similar in

2131
01:35:30,231 --> 01:35:35,231
many ways,
but the denial of these preferences of

2132
01:35:35,331 --> 01:35:38,270
these genetic preferences of these
evolutionary tendencies,

2133
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,020
that's not scientific at all like that.
That is,

2134
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:45,110
that's really preposterous.
And the fact that that's being taught to

2135
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:49,670
kids and that they go leave these
institutions with these thoughts in

2136
01:35:49,671 --> 01:35:52,700
their head that are based on a bunch of
people that have never even existed in

2137
01:35:52,701 --> 01:35:53,540
the outside world.

2138
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:57,110
That's what's fucked up about schools
and a lot of ways chair is there going

2139
01:35:57,111 --> 01:36:01,580
from learning by these people to
becoming one of these people teaching in

2140
01:36:01,581 --> 01:36:03,980
these schools and never existing,
uh,

2141
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:08,420
John gigantic percentage never existing
outside of academia.

2142
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:10,390
Absolutely.
So to speak,

2143
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,460
to your point about if I ever faced this
type of antipathy and so on,

2144
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,510
I gave two talks.
One of my first book came out at a

2145
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:21,140
university in the psychology department
and in the business school they were

2146
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:24,890
back to back to on two separate days.
So this was a talk on my book.

2147
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:27,380
How do you Darwin eyes,
the field of consumer behavior.

2148
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:30,170
I gave it in the psychology department
first,

2149
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:33,760
which is made up of a lot of people who
have background in neurosciences,

2150
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:35,720
in biology and they all listened and
said,

2151
01:36:35,721 --> 01:36:36,740
yeah,
beautiful.

2152
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,491
No kidding.
I mean,

2153
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:39,530
of course,
to study our consumer Tory nature,

2154
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:42,590
we have to understand the biological
impulses that drive us.

2155
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:46,070
Great.
Exact same talk the next day in the

2156
01:36:46,071 --> 01:36:48,200
business school.
This is one of the top universities in

2157
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:50,360
the world.
I couldn't get through a single

2158
01:36:50,361 --> 01:36:51,920
sentence.
Why?

2159
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:55,640
Because of the amount of hostility that
I faced in the business school,

2160
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:56,840
the business school.
Why Business?

2161
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:59,330
So I think so.
This is a very interesting question.

2162
01:36:59,331 --> 01:37:01,940
So I think business practitioners,
in other words,

2163
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:05,420
business people,
not business academics actually loved by

2164
01:37:05,421 --> 01:37:09,800
work or historically he loved my work
because they're not vested in a

2165
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:11,990
particular paradigm.
All they care ideology,

2166
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:15,380
they care about results.
What works right or earns the money.

2167
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:17,840
Exactly.
You're going to tell me what are the

2168
01:37:17,841 --> 01:37:22,841
evolutionary triggers for me to develop
a more effective advertising campaign.

2169
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:25,600
I'm in,
I'm in talk to me professor side.

2170
01:37:25,601 --> 01:37:28,760
I don't give a shit about your
paradigmatic fights in academia,

2171
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:30,710
but yes,
by the act,

2172
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:35,740
but the academics who've been vested in
social constructivism or an cultural

2173
01:37:36,261 --> 01:37:38,570
relativism,
every culture is relative.

2174
01:37:38,571 --> 01:37:42,380
There are no human universals.
There is no shared human nature.

2175
01:37:42,381 --> 01:37:47,381
There is no shared biological heritage.
Then I come in on my biology train and

2176
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:50,210
I'm dangerous.
We've got to shut this guy down.

2177
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,780
Now the reality is if you're
sufficiently confident about what you're

2178
01:37:53,781 --> 01:37:55,590
doing,
you ride out that storm.

2179
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,340
And Luckily

2180
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,390
for me,
you know,

2181
01:37:57,450 --> 01:38:00,060
now 20 years into the game,
uh,

2182
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:03,000
more people are coming to seeing things
in the way that I'm saying him.

2183
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:08,360
But it's taken a lot of dog fighting to
convince people,

2184
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,750
uh,
of,

2185
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:12,810
of the veracity of what I'm saying.
So when you were giving these speeches

2186
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:14,340
and you're being interrupted,
yeah.

2187
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:15,960
Like what are they saying?
No example.

2188
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:17,100
Okay,
I'll get the first one.

2189
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,180
How do you explain homosexuality?
Right?

2190
01:38:21,181 --> 01:38:24,240
Because their first instinct,
no pun intended,

2191
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:27,270
instincts as an evolutionary
term,

2192
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:28,610
uh,
they,

2193
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:31,470
they want to show that if everything is
evolutionary,

2194
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,720
if everything is adaptive,
then how could you explain something

2195
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:36,780
like homosexuality,
which by definition is Darwinian,

2196
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:38,340
could the socket that end?
Right?

2197
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:39,751
Well,
then I say,

2198
01:38:39,751 --> 01:38:41,790
well,
there are some evolutionary theories

2199
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,460
that try to explain homosexuality,
but that's not really the focus of my

2200
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:45,630
talk tonight.
Can I just go on?

2201
01:38:46,150 --> 01:38:49,080
And he explained suicide.
Here's the other.

2202
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,880
Now,
if we are these adaptive creatures that,

2203
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:55,260
that have this survival instinct,
how do you explain the fact that there

2204
01:38:55,261 --> 01:38:57,420
is an epidemiology of suicide?
Why would somebody to take their own

2205
01:38:57,421 --> 01:38:58,260
life?
So,

2206
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:59,690
uh,
if I started,

2207
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:03,600
it's pretty easy to describe.
I don't think I'd have a problem with

2208
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:06,810
no,
but then imagine if this goes on for

2209
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:08,310
every syllable that I authored,
right?

2210
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,850
So these are students that are
interrupting all these up,

2211
01:39:10,851 --> 01:39:12,960
but he's a professor professors,
as a matter of fact.

2212
01:39:13,010 --> 01:39:14,550
That's so rude.
Yeah.

2213
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:19,260
So two points I'll make the,
the more senior,

2214
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:23,520
the person in the room,
the more hostile they were really.

2215
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:27,720
So the doctoral students who took me out
to lunch after,

2216
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,640
we're all like,
Oh man,

2217
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:30,880
I love your stuff.
Professors up.

2218
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:31,830
Now why?
Again,

2219
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:36,630
anecdotally we can understand why
because the more senior professors are

2220
01:39:36,631 --> 01:39:41,631
vested in their paradigms,
therefore their brains are closed to any

2221
01:39:41,701 --> 01:39:43,890
ideas that might challenge the status
quo.

2222
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:49,020
The doctoral student who still surfing,
who's surfing at the buffet of ideas is

2223
01:39:49,021 --> 01:39:50,160
open to the idea.
Oh yeah.

2224
01:39:50,161 --> 01:39:53,250
Biology seems to make sense.
The second thing that I'll point when

2225
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:56,760
you said it's very rude.
I actually got upset and I'll just try

2226
01:39:56,761 --> 01:40:00,120
to stay with the Corum and politeness,
but as we were leaving,

2227
01:40:00,121 --> 01:40:02,040
I took a couple of those senior folks
and I said,

2228
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:04,740
you know,
what is the point of inviting me here

2229
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:09,900
and wasting your money and our
respective time by not giving me a

2230
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:12,660
chance to get through my talk?
Would it make more sense to give me the

2231
01:40:12,661 --> 01:40:14,310
forum?
And then at the end of the day,

2232
01:40:14,311 --> 01:40:17,520
if you decide that it's not worthwhile,
you throw it in the garbage,

2233
01:40:17,521 --> 01:40:20,580
but at least you've given,
you've given me the opportunity to share

2234
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:21,830
my ideas with you.
Oh No,

2235
01:40:21,831 --> 01:40:25,230
no professor side you mis mistook are
interruptions is because we were so

2236
01:40:25,231 --> 01:40:26,040
engaged.

2237
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:26,371
I said,
well,

2238
01:40:26,371 --> 01:40:29,220
it can't be really engaged when you're
not allowing me to finish the syllable.

2239
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:30,001
Well,
not only that,

2240
01:40:30,001 --> 01:40:33,360
it's really simple to take notes and
then at the end of it ask me questions.

2241
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:33,991
Right.
I mean,

2242
01:40:33,991 --> 01:40:37,290
why did they feel like they have the
right to interrupt your speech?

2243
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:41,280
That's a great question.
I usually ask people to hold off their

2244
01:40:41,281 --> 01:40:45,720
questions till the q and a period,
but I don't know why,

2245
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:49,230
but especially in business schools and
it's certainly in some of the top

2246
01:40:49,231 --> 01:40:53,080
business schools,
there's this culture of very sort of

2247
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:57,510
Alpha maleness where you hammer at the
person you,

2248
01:40:57,730 --> 01:41:00,020
you because you,
you're trying to one up them up and it's

2249
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,440
very,
there's a great story on Richard.

2250
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,270
Do you know who Richard Feinman is?
Yes.

2251
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:06,760
The Great Nobel Prize winning
physicists.

2252
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:08,320
I think I read it in his book.
Uh,

2253
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,550
surely.
You must be joking,

2254
01:41:09,551 --> 01:41:10,384
Mister Feynman.

2255
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:12,940
Uh,
so I hope I don't watch the story,

2256
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:17,470
but the story goes something like this.
He's giving his sort of pre final

2257
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:19,720
dissertation talk is sort of
departmental talk.

2258
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:24,750
He's still a doctoral student at
Princeton and fun of the WHO's who of

2259
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,860
leading physicists throughout.
I mean,

2260
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:31,270
Einstein is there and everybody's there
and as he's giving his talk as a young

2261
01:41:31,271 --> 01:41:34,030
doctoral student,
there is this one professor who's

2262
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:37,540
interrupting him and the way that those
folks were interrupting me at that

2263
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:42,250
school and from the corner somewhere,
apparently Albert Einstein says,

2264
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:46,540
don't you think we owe the young men the
respect to let him finish speaking?

2265
01:41:46,541 --> 01:41:49,840
And then I'm sure at the end of his talk
you'll have plenty of opportunities to

2266
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:51,760
answer us.
And then after that nobody said

2267
01:41:51,761 --> 01:41:54,190
anything.
So I think it's part of that baboons

2268
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:56,380
sort of gorilla thing.
I'm going to show you that I'm the

2269
01:41:56,381 --> 01:41:57,340
smartest guy in the room.

2270
01:41:57,580 --> 01:42:00,250
So you're typically see it from not the
truly elite,

2271
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:05,640
the truly elite don't have to do this,
but the guys just below want to show

2272
01:42:06,131 --> 01:42:09,820
that they're the toughest guys in the
prison yard and therefore they interrupt

2273
01:42:09,821 --> 01:42:10,571
you,
they harass you,

2274
01:42:10,571 --> 01:42:11,261
they heckle,
you know,

2275
01:42:11,261 --> 01:42:13,990
it's so on the same type of people that
would go after you with like a hate

2276
01:42:13,991 --> 01:42:15,400
blog.
Exactly.

2277
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:19,150
Professors that are just fringe
intellectuals that just really aren't

2278
01:42:19,151 --> 01:42:22,930
that really that smart,
but they've achieved this notoriety.

2279
01:42:22,931 --> 01:42:26,830
And a a status because of the fact
they're teaching at some school.

2280
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:28,300
Can I mention one such got,
sure.

2281
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:31,630
A grand buffoon,
peas,

2282
01:42:31,631 --> 01:42:33,620
Ed Meyers.
Do you know that?

2283
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,090
Yeah,
I know that is one of the most execrable

2284
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:41,500
creatures that has ever walked academia.
I don't know him personally well,

2285
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:46,860
but he's the exact type of guy who
exhibits those types of behaviors.

2286
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:52,260
He has an incredibly successful science
blog hat off hat tip to him for having

2287
01:42:53,561 --> 01:42:58,561
that forum,
but all he does all day is attack fellow

2288
01:42:58,870 --> 01:43:03,070
scientists an extra ordinarily,
you know,

2289
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,960
poisonous manners.

2290
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:08,200
It's never respectful.
Certainly evolutionary psychologists,

2291
01:43:08,201 --> 01:43:12,760
we're all lobotomized idiots who are
faking science.

2292
01:43:12,761 --> 01:43:16,510
He's the real scientists.
All of us are just idiots who couldn't,

2293
01:43:16,511 --> 01:43:18,100
you know,
are borderline illiterates.

2294
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:22,810
And the reality is the last time that he
ever published something was probably

2295
01:43:22,811 --> 01:43:27,460
around the period of the renaissance and
yet he feels perfectly comfortable

2296
01:43:27,461 --> 01:43:30,700
criticizing folks who are infinitely
more productive than him.

2297
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,230
And I only call him out,
not,

2298
01:43:32,231 --> 01:43:34,990
I don't know him,
but I just despise this type of

2299
01:43:34,991 --> 01:43:37,420
bullying.
This is kind of arrogance when they are

2300
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:40,780
incredibly honest,
hardworking scientists that in their

2301
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:43,390
best way are trying to understand the
world.

2302
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:46,150
But here's this guy who's got a huge
soapbox.

2303
01:43:46,151 --> 01:43:49,000
I mean,
I think over a hundred million views and

2304
01:43:49,001 --> 01:43:51,620
visitors on his side.
So he's got a big platform.

2305
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,790
He's just denigrating everybody.
There's a lot of,

2306
01:43:55,791 --> 01:43:59,150
um,
there's the slot out action in that.

2307
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:01,550
Like there's,
there's a lot of eyes.

2308
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:03,140
If you,
if you're one of those people that

2309
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:05,780
writes a hate blog,
you can get a lot of attention doing

2310
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:07,520
that.
And some people become very addicted to

2311
01:44:07,521 --> 01:44:11,060
attention and if you notice,
they start repeating those patterns and

2312
01:44:11,061 --> 01:44:15,290
blogging constantly over and over again.
And then also what he also does is

2313
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:18,200
anybody who opposes him,
he deletes them from the comments,

2314
01:44:18,201 --> 01:44:20,870
even if they're,
even if they're respectful,

2315
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,070
if you,
you're an idiot,

2316
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:23,840
you don't know what you're talking about
and gets rid of any,

2317
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:27,890
I became aware of him because that whole
Michael Shermer debacle.

2318
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,270
Yes.
The rape thing,

2319
01:44:29,271 --> 01:44:30,300
right?
Yeah.

2320
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:32,570
Well,
he accused Michael Shermer of rape

2321
01:44:32,571 --> 01:44:36,410
because he had sex with a woman a
consensually while they were both

2322
01:44:36,411 --> 01:44:38,330
intoxicated at a conference.

2323
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:39,500
I think.
Yeah,

2324
01:44:39,530 --> 01:44:40,100
see,
oh,

2325
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:41,090
that's how you got to know him.
Like,

2326
01:44:41,091 --> 01:44:42,650
yeah,
well that's how I heard of them.

2327
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,730
Right.
You know,

2328
01:44:43,731 --> 01:44:46,910
and just,
and it was the way it was done was so

2329
01:44:46,911 --> 01:44:51,911
reckless and so uninformed.
Like you don't know what happened unless

2330
01:44:51,991 --> 01:44:55,460
he were there.
And also there's photos of Michael

2331
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,980
Shermer and the girl's smiling weeks
after this incident.

2332
01:44:57,981 --> 01:45:01,760
It was all,
it's all very sorted and its ugliness,

2333
01:45:01,761 --> 01:45:05,390
right?
It's just to understand what he gets out

2334
01:45:05,391 --> 01:45:09,170
of this sort of frivolous,
diabolical ugliness.

2335
01:45:09,171 --> 01:45:10,760
It's a tension.
It's a tension maybe.

2336
01:45:10,761 --> 01:45:11,750
Yeah.
It gets attention.

2337
01:45:11,751 --> 01:45:14,990
And you know,
he is the Grand Poobah of the retarded

2338
01:45:14,991 --> 01:45:16,760
social justice warriors.
Very true.

2339
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:19,280
That's a,
there's a lot of people like that out

2340
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:20,450
there.
And there's,

2341
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,460
again,
there's a lot of attention in doing

2342
01:45:22,461 --> 01:45:24,260
something like that.
Um,

2343
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:25,483
you know,
and if,

2344
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,910
unfortunately it negates some really
good points that they might have,

2345
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:32,450
might have about a bunch of different
issues because you have to look at it

2346
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:35,720
through the lens of this really poisoned
his person.

2347
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:37,050
Exactly right.
You know,

2348
01:45:37,051 --> 01:45:38,880
I,
the first I had heard of him,

2349
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:42,180
uh,
was there was an incident that happened

2350
01:45:42,181 --> 01:45:45,270
on psychology today with a gentleman by
the name of Satoshi Kanazawa.

2351
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:46,610
Are you familiar with him?
No.

2352
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:52,030
So [inaudible] is a professor,
an evolutionary psychologist at the

2353
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:52,951
London School of Economics.
It's a very,

2354
01:45:52,951 --> 01:45:54,570
very prestigious school in London,
England,

2355
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:58,140
uh,
who was a very popular blogger at cycle

2356
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:01,890
at psychology today.
But he had a very sort of bombastic

2357
01:46:01,891 --> 01:46:06,870
style of writing that sort of drew a lot
of attention because of the way he

2358
01:46:06,871 --> 01:46:08,280
phrased things.
And,

2359
01:46:08,490 --> 01:46:10,470
but,
but I guess he thought that he was so

2360
01:46:10,471 --> 01:46:14,280
popular that he was sort of untouchable.
And at one point he wrote a blog article

2361
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:19,170
summarizing somebody else's work,
looking at racial differences in

2362
01:46:19,171 --> 01:46:20,850
attractiveness.
So for example,

2363
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,470
who's most attractive white women or
black women,

2364
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:26,970
white men or black men?
And one of the results from that

2365
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,720
Dataset,
this wasn't his own study,

2366
01:46:28,721 --> 01:46:30,210
he was summarizing somebody else's
water,

2367
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:34,770
was that black women had been rated as
less attractive than white women.

2368
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,960
And he gave some,
I guess,

2369
01:46:36,961 --> 01:46:39,120
speculative reasons as to why that might
be.

2370
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,450
So that caused a huge,
you know,

2371
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:42,600
fewer.
Uh,

2372
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:44,550
he's a racist,
but he's Japanese by the way.

2373
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:45,960
Uh,
he's a racist.

2374
01:46:45,961 --> 01:46:47,400
He hates blacks.
He hates this.

2375
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:48,240
He was,
he,

2376
01:46:48,241 --> 01:46:50,730
they tried to get him out of a
psychologist today.

2377
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:53,430
They eventually kicked him out.
They tried to revoke,

2378
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:58,470
they started a petition to try to revoke
his tenure at London School of

2379
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:59,820
Economics.
But I'll mention two points.

2380
01:46:59,821 --> 01:47:01,280
Number one,
uh,

2381
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:05,250
bees at meyers takes this example and
says,

2382
01:47:05,251 --> 01:47:07,830
look,
here's what evolution psychology is.

2383
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:10,980
Here's this racist who happens to be an
evolution psychologist.

2384
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:13,650
All evolution psychologists are racist.
Well,

2385
01:47:13,651 --> 01:47:15,690
I mean,
that's what racism usually is,

2386
01:47:15,691 --> 01:47:17,370
right?
Give me a generalization.

2387
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:21,630
I know a friend who is Jewish and who
was caught cheating on his taxes,

2388
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:26,280
that that shows you Jews cheat when it
comes to money because they're always

2389
01:47:26,281 --> 01:47:27,780
looking to make the most money.

2390
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:29,400
That's what happens with those jobs,
right?

2391
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:33,150
So he doesn't see the irony of that.
So then I wrote an article,

2392
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:35,170
which I frankly,
if you don't want me to say,

2393
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:39,030
it took a lot of courage where I,
and you could probably pull it up while

2394
01:47:39,031 --> 01:47:43,620
you could pull it up if you wanted,
where I basically argued that to purge a

2395
01:47:43,621 --> 01:47:46,260
blogger would set a very dangerous
precedent,

2396
01:47:46,261 --> 01:47:50,600
right?
If you disagree with whatever Satoshi

2397
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:53,490
Kanazawa saying,
let his words come back to haunt him,

2398
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:55,320
right?
His words will be there.

2399
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:59,430
If the are truly racist,
if he is espousing racial theories that

2400
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:02,400
are pure quackery,
that will be the biggest punishment he

2401
01:48:02,401 --> 01:48:06,060
could suffer.
But to remove him from the discourse,

2402
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:10,560
the public arena of ideas sets a very
dangerous precedent precedent.

2403
01:48:10,561 --> 01:48:11,281
Now,
guess what happened?

2404
01:48:11,281 --> 01:48:14,250
A lot of my academic colleagues wrote to
me privately said,

2405
01:48:14,251 --> 01:48:16,740
my God,
thank you for having the courage to

2406
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:18,720
write that article.
That's exactly what I thought.

2407
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:22,080
But I didn't want to write the article
because then people might think that I'm

2408
01:48:22,081 --> 01:48:25,770
supporting Satoshi.
So it shows you that why would this of

2409
01:48:25,771 --> 01:48:28,770
people,
to me it seemed very natural to write

2410
01:48:28,771 --> 01:48:30,000
that article.
I don't give a shit.

2411
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:33,360
I mean I know what's right and I'm going
to support that principle,

2412
01:48:33,361 --> 01:48:37,140
which is you don't ban people based on
ideas that they write.

2413
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:40,500
Let their ideas come back to haunt them
if they are bad ideas.

2414
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:41,360
Not only that,
right.

2415
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:45,050
Why is it okay to say that it,
there's a,

2416
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:51,790
there's an evolutionary desire for women
to breed with an Alpha male,

2417
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:54,770
like one of these romance novel guys.
Right.

2418
01:48:54,830 --> 01:48:59,830
Why is it okay to say that women are
more inclined to favor taller men with

2419
01:49:01,011 --> 01:49:06,011
broader shoulders and longer or whatever
the fuck it is or why is it okay to say

2420
01:49:06,681 --> 01:49:09,830
that women are less attractive to obese
short men?

2421
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:15,400
Why is it okay to say that women or or
that men would be less attractive to

2422
01:49:16,311 --> 01:49:17,960
obese women,
which is a fact,

2423
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,300
but as soon as you involve race,
that's it.

2424
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:22,940
Then you're not allowed to look at the
actual statistics.

2425
01:49:22,941 --> 01:49:24,740
You're not allowed to look at the real
numbers.

2426
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,020
Have you noticed by the way,
that the a hundred meters was very

2427
01:49:27,021 --> 01:49:29,540
racist this year wasn't racist.
How so?

2428
01:49:29,570 --> 01:49:30,403
Black people,
one,

2429
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:33,910
there were no Lebanese Jews who are
overweight that we're in the final,

2430
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:37,180
ah,
there was no proper representation of

2431
01:49:37,181 --> 01:49:40,210
the rich tapestry of humanity.
Why were they all black?

2432
01:49:40,211 --> 01:49:41,460
That was,
that was clearly racist.

2433
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:44,740
We're talking about an athletic event.
We're not talking about sex,

2434
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:45,723
right?
It's,

2435
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,200
it's,
it's all sorted

2436
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:50,920
in many ways.
Um,

2437
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:54,010
you could make the argument that there
are women that are far more beautiful

2438
01:49:54,011 --> 01:49:56,620
than any of that are black,
that are far more beautiful than any

2439
01:49:56,621 --> 01:49:57,460
white woman that,
you know,

2440
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:00,250
I mean,
there's a broad range of attractiveness

2441
01:50:00,251 --> 01:50:02,350
and all sorts of different,
um,

2442
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:04,750
uh,
different races and creeds and different

2443
01:50:04,751 --> 01:50:07,840
parts of the world and is also be
different.

2444
01:50:07,841 --> 01:50:11,050
People have different things that
they're attracted to.

2445
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:13,330
Sure.
Like some people are attracted to short

2446
01:50:13,331 --> 01:50:15,850
Asian women.
Some people are attracted to tall women

2447
01:50:15,851 --> 01:50:16,750
from Norway.
You know,

2448
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:20,620
there's a lot of variety in what people,
personal preference.

2449
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:23,230
Sure.
But when you're just looking at sheer

2450
01:50:23,231 --> 01:50:27,370
numbers and which is,
I'm sure he wasn't saying black women

2451
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:29,110
are completely unattractive.
Absolutely not.

2452
01:50:29,111 --> 01:50:30,760
That's in fact,
I think in the same study,

2453
01:50:30,761 --> 01:50:34,270
if I'm not mistaken,
he pointed to the fact that black men

2454
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:37,150
had been at scored as more attractive.

2455
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:42,480
So the result that demonstrates a
finding that is racially acceptable is

2456
01:50:43,781 --> 01:50:48,781
gleaned over the one that is
unacceptable then makes him a Kkk Nazi.

2457
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:51,790
He supposed to do what he's supposed to
ignore the statistics.

2458
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:53,280
Exactly.
Incidentally,

2459
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:53,681
the,
the,

2460
01:50:53,681 --> 01:50:54,250
the,
the,

2461
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:57,520
the king on this issue as a gentleman by
the name of Phillip Rushton,

2462
01:50:57,820 --> 01:51:01,840
who's now passed away a few years ago,
who was a Canadian psychologist who

2463
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:05,370
spent his career studying racial
differences specifically,

2464
01:51:05,371 --> 01:51:06,460
he studied,
uh,

2465
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:10,960
differences in Iq.
And I actually had a personal anecdote

2466
01:51:10,961 --> 01:51:13,840
with him because early on in my career,
uh,

2467
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:16,420
I think two years into my original
professorship,

2468
01:51:16,421 --> 01:51:21,421
I think it was [inaudible] 96 I was
giving a talk at a conference and this

2469
01:51:22,991 --> 01:51:27,010
hall had maybe 50 a hundred people.
And I hadn't looked at who were the

2470
01:51:27,011 --> 01:51:30,520
other speakers in my session,
but I noticed that people were very,

2471
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:34,420
seemed there's a lot of poison in the
air and it turned out I should have

2472
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:36,580
maybe checked before going into the
hall,

2473
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:39,940
that the gentleman who was speaking
immediately before me was this gentleman

2474
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:42,070
Phillip Rushton and he's going to talk
about,

2475
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:45,310
um,
a cranial capacity postmortal carrying

2476
01:51:45,311 --> 01:51:47,560
capacity of black men,
black women,

2477
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:48,940
white men,
white women.

2478
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:50,920
And then he would show some racial
differences.

2479
01:51:50,921 --> 01:51:54,340
We forget everybody riled up.
And this was probably the only time ever

2480
01:51:54,341 --> 01:51:58,150
where I was about to give a talk where I
was genuinely terrified because I

2481
01:51:58,151 --> 01:52:00,790
thought that I would just get lynched by
proxy because I'm,

2482
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:04,120
I'm the next guy in line and they just
going to kill me just because I was next

2483
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:07,870
on the same stage as him.
The good news for me is that after he

2484
01:52:07,871 --> 01:52:08,950
finished his stock,
so the room,

2485
01:52:08,951 --> 01:52:11,560
let's say I had 1500 people,
he finishes a stock.

2486
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:16,590
I'm getting ready to go up about 425 out
of the 1500 leave to follow him.

2487
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:19,270
And his new yelled at him to yell at him
to kill her.

2488
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:23,050
And there's maybe like 75 people in the,
in a room of,

2489
01:52:23,290 --> 01:52:25,570
and I was actually very happy that there
were so few.

2490
01:52:25,870 --> 01:52:30,870
So few people that had stayed at my talk
undeniable physical differences in human

2491
01:52:30,941 --> 01:52:34,270
beings to,
to somehow or another say that bringing

2492
01:52:34,271 --> 01:52:36,550
those up is racist,
is really strange.

2493
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:40,540
Like there's just some undeniable
physical differences in bone structure,

2494
01:52:40,541 --> 01:52:44,260
bone density.
There's just some thing,

2495
01:52:44,261 --> 01:52:45,770
like for instance,
uh,

2496
01:52:45,771 --> 01:52:47,210
African American women,
uh,

2497
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:52,240
tend to have a higher bone density and
similar bone density to a Caucasian men,

2498
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:54,620
which is very rare.
Like in women,

2499
01:52:54,621 --> 01:52:57,350
it's not the same like African American
women have denser bones,

2500
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:58,670
uh,
per capita.

2501
01:52:58,671 --> 01:53:00,710
You know,
normally rather you've got on average,

2502
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:02,570
just in general,
just in general,

2503
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,080
you know,
who and who knows what the origin of

2504
01:53:06,081 --> 01:53:06,681
that.
I mean,

2505
01:53:06,681 --> 01:53:09,230
you could go into that from an
evolutionary standpoint and try to

2506
01:53:09,231 --> 01:53:11,390
figure out what part of the world they
come from,

2507
01:53:11,391 --> 01:53:13,640
what you know,
what their ancestors did,

2508
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:16,670
what would have been the selection
pressures that would have resulted in

2509
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:19,490
this indication that they're fascinating
conversation.

2510
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:21,900
Exactly what Phillip Rushton,
you still have new,

2511
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,910
he used to argue,
look,

2512
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:24,710
I'm not a racist,
I don't have an agenda.

2513
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:27,950
I follow an interesting line of
questions.

2514
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:29,900
Yes.
And here's the data.

2515
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:34,730
Now I've asked people who were friends
with him privately,

2516
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:37,190
so,
so what is the deal on the gentleman?

2517
01:53:37,191 --> 01:53:38,300
Is he racist?
Is he not?

2518
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:41,870
And I've never been told by anybody that
he was a racist.

2519
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:45,770
But here's where I'm confused.
If you're showing actual skulls and

2520
01:53:45,771 --> 01:53:48,710
you're actually measuring cranial
capacity,

2521
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:52,550
are you not allowed to do that?
Are you not allowed to look at the

2522
01:53:52,551 --> 01:53:57,350
differences between Asian people and the
Norwegian people?

2523
01:53:57,351 --> 01:54:02,000
Or are people from Antarctica versus how
you not allowed to do that?

2524
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:04,460
Because it seems kind of crazy if you're
not allowed to.

2525
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:06,860
So that's part of,
there's a great paper that was published

2526
01:54:06,861 --> 01:54:10,010
I think in 2005 or 2006 either in
science or nature.

2527
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:13,730
I love the title of the paper.
I think it's forbidden knowledge and

2528
01:54:13,731 --> 01:54:18,731
it's specifically sort of breaks down
the types of research questions that if

2529
01:54:19,851 --> 01:54:22,910
you want to have a viable career as a
scientist,

2530
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:24,350
you should stay away from.

2531
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:28,760
And I think pretty much on top of that
list is studying racial differences,

2532
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:34,090
especially racial differences that might
eventually point to a finding that is

2533
01:54:36,441 --> 01:54:37,970
politically incorrect.
Right?

2534
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:42,470
That's an excellent way for you to
become the pariah of academia,

2535
01:54:42,471 --> 01:54:45,020
if not more generally the public.
And so,

2536
01:54:45,021 --> 01:54:45,710
yeah,
it's growth.

2537
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:49,280
I actually did a sad truth clip on my
youtube channel where I talked about,

2538
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:52,070
you know,
facts are not racist,

2539
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:54,710
right?
I mean w [inaudible] and boolean logic

2540
01:54:54,711 --> 01:54:57,080
and mathematical logic.
You'd take a statement and it's either

2541
01:54:57,081 --> 01:55:00,020
true or false,
it has a binary value one or zero,

2542
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:00,771
right?
I mean,

2543
01:55:00,771 --> 01:55:04,160
that's how we create circuitry,
architectural circuitry of a computer,

2544
01:55:04,161 --> 01:55:05,660
right?
It has a truth value.

2545
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:06,470
Yes.
No.

2546
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:10,220
Right?
So the idea that a statement is racist

2547
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:11,750
scientifically,
no,

2548
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:15,080
it's either false or not false or
provisionally true.

2549
01:55:15,650 --> 01:55:17,600
Uh,
but apparently the argument from the

2550
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:22,601
other camp is the mere fact that you
asked these questions suggest that there

2551
01:55:23,601 --> 01:55:27,800
must be a reason that is nefarious for
you to ask these questions.

2552
01:55:27,801 --> 01:55:30,200
What is the value in asking that
question?

2553
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:35,440
So they sort of infer a nefarious motive
to you going down that alley.

2554
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:38,330
Yeah,
but you can't do that.

2555
01:55:38,331 --> 01:55:40,520
And because it's an appeal to ignorance,
you,

2556
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:42,440
you're,
you're saying that let's all,

2557
01:55:42,590 --> 01:55:43,800
let's all feign

2558
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:49,010
ignorance and not look at the actual
facts of just the physical bodies of

2559
01:55:49,591 --> 01:55:53,370
human beings and that they vary based on
climate based on,

2560
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:54,360
you know,
what,

2561
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:56,400
what area of the world,
what,

2562
01:55:56,401 --> 01:56:00,180
what the people were up to that were
living there for generation after

2563
01:56:00,181 --> 01:56:03,660
generation that led to the genetics
expressing themselves and the way they

2564
01:56:03,661 --> 01:56:06,930
do in 2016 it's,
it's crazy,

2565
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:08,760
but it's weird.
It's weird.

2566
01:56:08,761 --> 01:56:11,850
And it's,
it's almost like in response to what

2567
01:56:11,851 --> 01:56:14,550
they believe to be illogical criticism.
That's inevitable.

2568
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:16,830
It's like this illogical criticism is
inevitable.

2569
01:56:16,831 --> 01:56:21,570
So hedge your bets early and say there's
no difference between the sexes.

2570
01:56:21,571 --> 01:56:24,450
There's no difference between the races.
I don't want to get in any arguments.

2571
01:56:24,451 --> 01:56:26,940
I want tenure.
I want just to want to keep promoting

2572
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:30,850
ignorance at an institution of learning
Zap,

2573
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:32,220
which is bananas.

2574
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:34,310
Is it that the,
that's how you remember already were

2575
01:56:34,311 --> 01:56:35,990
asking me.
So who are some of these,

2576
01:56:35,991 --> 01:56:39,850
the tractors of evolutionary psychology?
So what you just mentioned kind of can

2577
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:44,860
bring us back to that point.
Some of the early proponents of sort of

2578
01:56:45,381 --> 01:56:50,381
this anti evolutionary position came
from anthropologists who saw the

2579
01:56:52,281 --> 01:56:57,281
potential for biology being misused or
Darwinian theory to be misused,

2580
01:56:57,381 --> 01:56:58,930
right?
So the Nazis can,

2581
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:00,770
can,
can refer to,

2582
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:02,150
you know,
Darwinian theory.

2583
01:57:02,151 --> 01:57:04,730
There's a,
there's a struggle between the races and

2584
01:57:04,731 --> 01:57:08,240
we are the areas the Jews lost.
So what's wrong with getting rid of

2585
01:57:08,241 --> 01:57:09,110
them?
That's Darwinian.

2586
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:10,430
Of course,
it has nothing to do with Darwinian

2587
01:57:10,431 --> 01:57:13,190
theory,
but I the assert the theory for my

2588
01:57:13,191 --> 01:57:16,610
nefarious pursuits.
A British class elitists said,

2589
01:57:16,611 --> 01:57:18,600
hey,
there's a struggle between the uh,

2590
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:20,720
classes.
We are the upper class.

2591
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:23,060
Who cares if the lower class are
eliminated?

2592
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:24,770
If we don't fund them,
if we don't give them healthcare,

2593
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:26,990
if we don't educate them,
that's natural selection.

2594
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:31,310
You Genesis said the same thing.
You know what's wrong if we sterilize,

2595
01:57:31,490 --> 01:57:33,290
uh,
people who are dull,

2596
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:36,290
you know,
mentally deficient people who are maybe

2597
01:57:36,291 --> 01:57:38,420
a bit too dark,
people who are homosexual,

2598
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:40,790
hey that's cleaning out the gene pool.
Hey that's Darwinian,

2599
01:57:40,791 --> 01:57:43,010
right?
So some anthropologists thought,

2600
01:57:43,250 --> 01:57:43,760
well,
you know,

2601
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:48,760
there is going to be misuse of biology.
So let's now create a new world view

2602
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:53,510
built on bullshit.
So the edifice is built on bullshit

2603
01:57:53,511 --> 01:57:55,760
after bullshit,
but at least there won't be an

2604
01:57:55,761 --> 01:57:59,720
opportunity for people to otherwise
misuse biology.

2605
01:57:59,721 --> 01:58:03,560
And so how do they express that?
They created a narrative that basically

2606
01:58:03,561 --> 01:58:07,910
says that cultural relativism is what?
The fines,

2607
01:58:07,911 --> 01:58:10,190
humanity.
Every culture is unique.

2608
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:13,130
Every culture is different.
There is no such thing as human

2609
01:58:13,131 --> 01:58:13,940
universals.

2610
01:58:13,940 --> 01:58:18,940
Cause that would necessitate biological
commonalities which we don't accept.

2611
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:23,840
And so therefore for a hundred years,
anthropology departments have been built

2612
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:27,920
on an edifice of pure bullshit,
at least the cultural anthropologists.

2613
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:30,410
The Bio anthropologists recognize
biology.

2614
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:33,560
But the cultural anthropologists are
driven by a premise of cultural

2615
01:58:33,561 --> 01:58:36,080
relativism,
which incidentally on our common friend

2616
01:58:36,081 --> 01:58:39,260
Sam Harris,
it tells a great story about moral

2617
01:58:39,261 --> 01:58:41,620
relativism.
And I hope I don't watch the story,

2618
01:58:41,621 --> 01:58:45,190
but apparently he was at a conference
somewhere where he had a chance to speak

2619
01:58:45,191 --> 01:58:49,930
to the bioethicist who is sitting on the
president's commission on bioethics.

2620
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:53,560
And she apparently is a sort of moral
relativist stipe.

2621
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:56,710
And he asks her,
are you sure that there are no universal

2622
01:58:56,711 --> 01:58:57,580
moral truths?
I mean,

2623
01:58:57,790 --> 01:59:01,990
are you not able to pronounce a position
on whether if there were a culture where

2624
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:07,060
people were told that every fourth child
has to have his eyes gouged so that he

2625
01:59:07,061 --> 01:59:11,230
can walk towards the light without eyes,
would you support?

2626
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:12,760
Well,
who am I to judge?

2627
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:17,970
So this bio ethicists was unable to pass
a moral judgment as to whether if you

2628
01:59:19,511 --> 01:59:23,860
had a religious narrative that says that
every fourth child should have his eyes

2629
01:59:23,861 --> 01:59:26,830
gouged out,
she couldn't pronounce the position.

2630
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:29,830
And the reason why she couldn't,
she because she is shackled,

2631
01:59:29,831 --> 01:59:34,000
she's intellectually shackled by the
narrative of cultural relativism.

2632
01:59:34,001 --> 01:59:37,120
Who are we to judge other culture.
It's the lack of criticism for things

2633
01:59:37,121 --> 01:59:41,530
like female genital mutilation in the
Islam and that's why the ca strata and

2634
01:59:41,531 --> 01:59:46,360
chief Justin true though.
That's why when he was not before he was

2635
01:59:46,361 --> 01:59:48,730
prime minister,
when he was a minister in parliament,

2636
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:54,090
he got very upset when somebody referred
to child bride honor,

2637
01:59:54,461 --> 01:59:56,560
killing,
genital mutilation,

2638
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:59,650
throwing acid in their faces when they
refuse marriage,

2639
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:00,730
whatever.
Uh,

2640
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:04,420
somebody referred to these practices as
barbaric and there is no place for the

2641
02:00:04,421 --> 02:00:05,320
Mccain society.

2642
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:10,620
He didn't get upset by those practices.
He got upset by the other politician

2643
02:00:11,141 --> 02:00:13,870
referring to them as barbera.
Is that true?

2644
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:14,800
That is true.
Look it up.

2645
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,710
Then he later came out and you know,
hedged and so on.

2646
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:21,280
Of course after criticism of course,
but he's responding to that standard

2647
02:00:21,281 --> 02:00:26,110
social justice warrior sort of creed.
He is the king and we've talked about

2648
02:00:26,111 --> 02:00:27,580
this I think last time on the show
briefly.

2649
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:30,580
He is the king of the social justice
warriors.

2650
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:35,790
He is taking down Canada to meet where
Sweden and the rest of the European hell

2651
02:00:36,001 --> 02:00:38,920
holes are not becoming as fast as he
can.

2652
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:40,930
Well,
what is his motivation?

2653
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,110
I think he's,
I don't,

2654
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:46,690
I don't think it's because he's an evil
guy who you know has nefarious ulterior

2655
02:00:46,691 --> 02:00:49,480
motives.
I think he is simply profoundly

2656
02:00:49,481 --> 02:00:52,570
misguided because of all the bullshit
that you and I have talked about through

2657
02:00:52,571 --> 02:00:53,350
the years.

2658
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:58,180
He comes from a environment of social
justice warriors.

2659
02:00:58,181 --> 02:01:03,040
His Dad was the architect.
Pure true though was the architect of

2660
02:01:03,041 --> 02:01:05,440
multiculturalism and Canada.
Now,

2661
02:01:05,441 --> 02:01:07,660
multiculturalism,
as we may or may not have discussed on

2662
02:01:07,661 --> 02:01:09,700
the show before,
has two different meanings.

2663
02:01:09,701 --> 02:01:11,860
We could talk about multiculturalism.
As you know,

2664
02:01:11,861 --> 02:01:15,670
there are many cultures in Orange County
that's multicultural but

2665
02:01:15,671 --> 02:01:18,100
multiculturalism as a political
philosophy,

2666
02:01:18,370 --> 02:01:22,480
as the idea that when people come to
your land you don't ask them to

2667
02:01:22,481 --> 02:01:26,680
assimilate.
You rejoice in the fact that everybody

2668
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:30,790
has their unique,
distinct cultures where they can express

2669
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:32,560
themselves in any way that they can.
Well,

2670
02:01:32,561 --> 02:01:35,290
of course in some cases that's fine.
When it comes to cuisine,

2671
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:39,340
it's not fine when it comes to let's cut
off some cliteracy his right,

2672
02:01:39,341 --> 02:01:40,010
I don't where

2673
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:44,580
it's not fine when it comes to genocidal
hatred of the Jews honor killings and on

2674
02:01:44,581 --> 02:01:46,610
it.
But from his perspective,

2675
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:51,640
he is simply shackled by his inability
to have a clear moral compass that says

2676
02:01:51,950 --> 02:01:53,900
this is right,
this is wrong.

2677
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:58,880
Because all he sees as the parasites in
his brain that says,

2678
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:02,150
who am I to judge?
Well judge Asshole,

2679
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:04,550
they are thumb some things that are
right and some things that are wrong.

2680
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:07,850
And when we're talking about things like
people,

2681
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:12,880
uh,
objecting to the analysis of cranial

2682
02:02:12,891 --> 02:02:16,700
capacity of different people,
I could see why some people would be

2683
02:02:16,701 --> 02:02:20,030
uncomfortable with that because I could
see how some people would perceive that

2684
02:02:20,031 --> 02:02:22,460
as being some sort of a justification
for racism.

2685
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:25,520
And so there was stand,
but as a person who is not racist,

2686
02:02:25,580 --> 02:02:27,440
I'm not racist.
I don't think you are either.

2687
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:29,720
We,
when we're discussing this,

2688
02:02:29,721 --> 02:02:34,670
it becomes a matter of just being a very
curious biological trait,

2689
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:35,030
right?

2690
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:37,520
And it doesn't make someone superior or
inferior.

2691
02:02:37,521 --> 02:02:40,790
It makes someone different.
And it's fascinating to me because I'm

2692
02:02:40,791 --> 02:02:45,791
looking at the human evolution of the
species as being this massive complex

2693
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:50,920
algorithm that's been going on since the
beginning of single celled organisms

2694
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:54,440
branching off into multicell organism.
So there's has been this process of

2695
02:02:54,441 --> 02:02:59,441
change and what has made this process so
that people that live in Iceland are so

2696
02:03:00,501 --> 02:03:01,790
big.
You know,

2697
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:04,430
you look at those men that when those
strong man competitions,

2698
02:03:04,431 --> 02:03:06,170
how many of them are from fucking
Iceland?

2699
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:08,180
It's crazy.
Like what is that?

2700
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:10,100
What it was it viking genetics.
Okay,

2701
02:03:10,101 --> 02:03:11,390
well what,
tell me what happened.

2702
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:13,730
Why are their bones so big?
Why they're so tall?

2703
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:17,000
Like what is it?
What is it about certain people in

2704
02:03:17,001 --> 02:03:20,450
Africa?
Marathon runners are always from east

2705
02:03:20,451 --> 02:03:21,960
Africa.
Yeah.

2706
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:23,300
Was it West Africa?
No,

2707
02:03:23,301 --> 02:03:25,000
east Africa.
Which ones is West Africa?

2708
02:03:25,390 --> 02:03:27,140
Africa as the sprinters.
That's funny,

2709
02:03:27,141 --> 02:03:28,880
isn't it?
Their muscles structures are very

2710
02:03:28,881 --> 02:03:29,430
different.
Right?

2711
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:33,650
Slow twitch versus the longer,
so the east African soul,

2712
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:38,770
Ethiopians and Eritreans and so on,
Kenyans have these elevated bodies that

2713
02:03:38,811 --> 02:03:43,811
are just built for a long distance.
The other guys are packed muscles.

2714
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:45,620
Right?
Uh,

2715
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:50,060
that's why you get those differences
that is not viewed as racist because

2716
02:03:50,061 --> 02:03:52,370
ultimately you're talking about success.
Success,

2717
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:53,990
right?
On the other hand,

2718
02:03:53,991 --> 02:03:58,991
if you talk about race a as somehow less
good at something than race be and where

2719
02:03:59,111 --> 02:04:02,570
race a scores high on the victimology
Olympics,

2720
02:04:02,571 --> 02:04:04,310
forgive the pun and you're screwed,
you,

2721
02:04:04,311 --> 02:04:07,730
that there was a fantastic radiolab
podcast that dealt with,

2722
02:04:07,731 --> 02:04:09,710
uh,
people from one particular part of the

2723
02:04:09,711 --> 02:04:11,990
world that were amazing at running.
And uh,

2724
02:04:11,991 --> 02:04:15,590
they were talking about their ability to
endure pain because of the rituals that

2725
02:04:15,591 --> 02:04:16,040
they were.

2726
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:18,230
Uh,
they had to endure the rites of passage

2727
02:04:18,231 --> 02:04:21,380
as Madison there,
their circumcision done with like sharp

2728
02:04:21,381 --> 02:04:24,850
sticks and having to crawl naked through
thorn bushes and,

2729
02:04:24,851 --> 02:04:27,980
and like really dark,
dark shit that they had to do.

2730
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:31,010
And it was interesting because one guy
who had gone through that and became

2731
02:04:31,011 --> 02:04:35,330
this unbelievably successful runner and
just had this unbelievable ability to

2732
02:04:35,331 --> 02:04:38,160
shut off the pain signal,
like to ignore it,

2733
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:42,210
but he was also talking about who we
wouldn't want his son to go through that

2734
02:04:42,211 --> 02:04:45,570
same process and that he believes that
the benefits are not worth it.

2735
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:49,050
And that remember what culture that was.
Um,

2736
02:04:49,051 --> 02:04:49,950
I do not,
uh,

2737
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:52,380
Jamie could probably pull that up.
He's probably looking it up right now,

2738
02:04:52,410 --> 02:04:54,290
but it was a,
an unfortunately,

2739
02:04:54,291 --> 02:04:56,670
he's like,
I listen to like five podcasts a day,

2740
02:04:56,671 --> 02:04:58,830
so probably a fucking million podcasts
ago.

2741
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:01,410
What is it going Kenyan runners?
There's a Kenyan,

2742
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:06,540
but it's a particular part of Kenya
is a very small population of people by

2743
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:09,270
the way,
that engage in this like really brutal

2744
02:05:09,271 --> 02:05:12,690
ritual of manhood,
a rite of passage.

2745
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:13,870
It's really,
um,

2746
02:05:13,950 --> 02:05:14,431
it's,
it's,

2747
02:05:14,431 --> 02:05:16,510
it's,
it is fascinating how the,

2748
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:18,420
is this it right here?
Okay.

2749
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:20,490
Yes.
Yes.

2750
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:23,890
Collagen,
Collagen people pursue,

2751
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:26,190
pursue,
produced an astonishing number of great

2752
02:05:26,191 --> 02:05:28,800
long distance runners.
Subpopulation of Kenyans.

2753
02:05:28,890 --> 02:05:29,930
Yeah.
Those,

2754
02:05:29,931 --> 02:05:31,980
that practice,
those rites of passage.

2755
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

2756
02:05:33,061 --> 02:05:38,061
So it's not just biology with them,
but it's also this unbelievable ability

2757
02:05:38,641 --> 02:05:39,441
to,
to die.

2758
02:05:39,441 --> 02:05:42,300
And it's called the,
the actual episodes called cut and run

2759
02:05:42,510 --> 02:05:46,170
because it's about circumcision,
about what they're forced to do while

2760
02:05:46,171 --> 02:05:48,510
they have a stick poking through their
dick.

2761
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:53,070
It's really hardcore.
And that this ability to shut off pain

2762
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:56,130
and ability to endure is a,
a,

2763
02:05:56,280 --> 02:06:00,180
a key factor in their ability to succeed
in running that it's a mental toughness

2764
02:06:00,181 --> 02:06:00,720
thing as well.

2765
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:05,430
Like they've maybe perhaps turned on
this aspect of their brain and he's

2766
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:06,120
like,
yeah.

2767
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:08,310
And have you,
have you heard of this other rite of

2768
02:06:08,311 --> 02:06:08,861
passage?
I,

2769
02:06:08,861 --> 02:06:11,640
I talk about this one of my books that
with the bull ants?

2770
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:13,800
Yes.
Yes.

2771
02:06:14,210 --> 02:06:15,870
Yeah.
I know a guy who's been bitten by one.

2772
02:06:15,871 --> 02:06:19,170
My friend Steve,
my friend Steve was in Bolivia.

2773
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:23,460
He was there filming his show called
meat eater and he went down there and

2774
02:06:23,461 --> 02:06:26,310
uh,
he got a bullet ant bite in his foot and

2775
02:06:26,311 --> 02:06:29,550
he said it was so unbelievably scores
the high.

2776
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:32,160
So there's a paint quotient,
whatever.

2777
02:06:32,161 --> 02:06:35,910
I don't know the exact metric,
but apparently the bullet ant scores the

2778
02:06:35,911 --> 02:06:37,220
highest on that.
Yeah.

2779
02:06:37,250 --> 02:06:41,010
And so this particular peoples in their
rite of passage,

2780
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:42,150
uh,
you could probably pull,

2781
02:06:42,151 --> 02:06:44,070
they take a glove,
they take gloves,

2782
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:47,190
they said date the,
the ants.

2783
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:51,840
When the ants wake up,
they start stinging the hands that are

2784
02:06:51,841 --> 02:06:52,530
in those gloves.

2785
02:06:52,530 --> 02:06:56,590
So they are multiple of these bites,
dozens all over the globe,

2786
02:06:56,591 --> 02:07:00,120
all over the glove.
And they have to do that ritual I think

2787
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:05,121
if I'm not mistaken 20 times before they
are accepted as man or someone who could

2788
02:07:06,721 --> 02:07:08,640
take a fucking been there you go there
you,

2789
02:07:08,641 --> 02:07:12,040
Jesus Christ,
the amount of pain that you would endure

2790
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:14,210
it by doing that.
It's just the,

2791
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:18,180
there was a guy from Australia that did
it for a,

2792
02:07:18,240 --> 02:07:20,670
some sort of a television special and
one of going to the hospital.

2793
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:21,830
But uh,
you,

2794
02:07:21,831 --> 02:07:24,570
you,
you see the pain in his face while he's

2795
02:07:24,571 --> 02:07:26,950
doing it credible.
They say it's like getting your hand

2796
02:07:26,951 --> 02:07:30,140
slammed in a car door 24 hours a day.
Incredible.

2797
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:32,280
Yeah.
And it lasts a long time.

2798
02:07:32,281 --> 02:07:35,010
It lasts for hours.
What was interesting is my friend Steve,

2799
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:36,160
he got stung

2800
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:39,520
by this bullet and he says,
unbelievably painful for about an hour

2801
02:07:39,521 --> 02:07:41,080
or two hours.
Like where you just like,

2802
02:07:41,081 --> 02:07:42,990
you can't believe how much pain you're
in during.

2803
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:46,810
And then he said after that he could
remember which ankle got stung.

2804
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:49,120
No,
just goes away.

2805
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:51,340
It goes away.
And then he's just walking through the

2806
02:07:51,341 --> 02:07:52,870
woods with these people.
The,

2807
02:07:52,871 --> 02:07:55,990
um,
I'm trying to remember the name of the

2808
02:07:55,991 --> 02:07:58,060
people in Amazon via,
yes.

2809
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:01,630
We'll try to remember the name of these
people that he was.

2810
02:08:01,631 --> 02:08:04,120
Um,
I don't remember.

2811
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:05,470
Anyways,
speaking of bullets,

2812
02:08:05,471 --> 02:08:07,630
can I tell you another story short on
this vacation?

2813
02:08:07,890 --> 02:08:11,590
So I have a FBI special agent friend
here in southern California,

2814
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:15,070
and so I know Fred,
Fred.

2815
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:15,671
Oh,
you've met him.

2816
02:08:15,671 --> 02:08:16,610
That's true.
That's right.

2817
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:17,950
That's right.
So,

2818
02:08:17,951 --> 02:08:20,920
uh,
so his last name now I won't,

2819
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:22,720
I won't.
Actually,

2820
02:08:22,721 --> 02:08:27,721
we'd met Fred and I met another
gentleman who is a CIA operative and we

2821
02:08:29,051 --> 02:08:31,000
went out that conversation should young.

2822
02:08:31,650 --> 02:08:33,010
Oh boy.
Uh,

2823
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:35,890
maybe I'll give a little few hence
later.

2824
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:38,560
But anyways,
he took me out to a,

2825
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:42,550
cause we've talked about bullets.
I asked him if we could go to a shooting

2826
02:08:42,551 --> 02:08:44,110
range and he said,
sure,

2827
02:08:44,111 --> 02:08:46,840
let's do it.
So he brought his whole arsenal of FBI

2828
02:08:46,841 --> 02:08:50,290
stuff and he had another friend with him
who was a security type guy.

2829
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:52,600
And so I went shooting for the first
time ever.

2830
02:08:52,601 --> 02:08:54,060
Even though I've never shot a gun
before.

2831
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:55,480
No.
Even though I've grown up in the

2832
02:08:55,481 --> 02:08:59,620
Lebanese civil war and I had held the,
I think it was a question Kalashnikov.

2833
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:02,050
Uh,
I'd never fired a gun.

2834
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:05,380
Wow.
It was something that's interesting.

2835
02:09:05,410 --> 02:09:08,980
Yeah.
I guess you shoot your hunt,

2836
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:09,843
correct?
Yeah.

2837
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:11,870
But you hunt with a bow and Arrow,
correct.

2838
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:13,090
Hunt with a rifle you've had.
Okay.

2839
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:14,560
Yeah.
All these animals you see around your

2840
02:09:14,561 --> 02:09:16,330
shot with a rifle,
the rifle,

2841
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:17,290
that one,
that one,

2842
02:09:17,670 --> 02:09:19,840
the one outside with the shot that with
a rifle too.

2843
02:09:19,890 --> 02:09:22,410
Right.
So I've shot things with both bone

2844
02:09:22,411 --> 02:09:24,600
marrow and rifle.
So when was the first time that you ever

2845
02:09:24,610 --> 02:09:25,870
shot?
Four years ago.

2846
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:26,690
Well,
no,

2847
02:09:26,690 --> 02:09:27,700
not just guns.
Yeah,

2848
02:09:27,701 --> 02:09:28,760
long time ago.
A long time ago.

2849
02:09:28,990 --> 02:09:31,030
Yeah.
It was unbelievable.

2850
02:09:31,031 --> 02:09:33,730
It was really,
I mean it's a lot more,

2851
02:09:33,790 --> 02:09:34,840
he told me actually,
he said,

2852
02:09:34,841 --> 02:09:35,201
look,
I'll,

2853
02:09:35,201 --> 02:09:40,120
I'll book the range for two hours and
either you'll be the type of guy who go

2854
02:09:40,121 --> 02:09:45,121
there and we'll use the two hours or
you'll shoot once and you'll say,

2855
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:47,830
this is not for me.
I don't like it and we'll leave.

2856
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:51,990
Cause I was asking him what should my
wife gets come back to pick me up at?

2857
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:54,040
Well I turned out that I stayed for the
full two hours,

2858
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:58,720
but I can understand sort of the,
the response that people might have

2859
02:09:58,721 --> 02:09:59,670
where,
because the,

2860
02:09:59,950 --> 02:10:02,620
it's a lot more powerful than you think.

2861
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:02,891
Right?
I mean,

2862
02:10:02,891 --> 02:10:04,390
you could speak to this probably better
than I can.

2863
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:07,280
Uh,
I shot also the submachine gun,

2864
02:10:07,290 --> 02:10:10,480
the FBI something.
I found that a lot easier because it's

2865
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:14,080
kind of recoil recoil,
but the guns and I think that would have

2866
02:10:14,081 --> 02:10:15,640
different calibers.
2145.

2867
02:10:15,641 --> 02:10:17,390
I don't remember the exact numbers.
Uh,

2868
02:10:17,470 --> 02:10:18,240
wow.
There,

2869
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:22,210
that's why I have some really powerful
rifles that were even different.

2870
02:10:22,211 --> 02:10:24,460
I'm sure that anything you shot,
I have some hunting rifles,

2871
02:10:24,461 --> 02:10:27,760
like a 300 win mag that is like getting
punched in the shoulder.

2872
02:10:27,761 --> 02:10:28,594
Every time you,
you,

2873
02:10:28,710 --> 02:10:31,000
you,
you shoot it because it's designed to

2874
02:10:31,001 --> 02:10:33,650
shoot Moose and elk and big giant
animals.

2875
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:34,310
It's a heavy

2876
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:35,840
fee,
really strong,

2877
02:10:35,841 --> 02:10:37,940
powerful round and a,
yeah,

2878
02:10:37,941 --> 02:10:41,180
the vulnerability that you feel when
that trigger goes off and you hear that

2879
02:10:41,181 --> 02:10:43,100
boom.
And I'm sure you're wearing your head

2880
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:44,450
gear,
your guards,

2881
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:46,190
which you really have to,
it's so important.

2882
02:10:46,490 --> 02:10:50,120
There's so many people out there that
hunt and shoot without ear protection

2883
02:10:50,121 --> 02:10:53,740
and they wind up having tendonitis or
tinnitus and yeah,

2884
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:56,750
all sorts of issues with their hearing.
It's so bad for you.

2885
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:57,270
Well,
what he,

2886
02:10:57,270 --> 02:11:02,120
what was interesting is when before we
went and he gave me maybe a 10 15 minute

2887
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:06,650
safety mini lecture,
the main one that he gave,

2888
02:11:06,651 --> 02:11:08,480
I mean this is of course live,
this is not,

2889
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:10,430
these are live bullets.
I mean are lethal.

2890
02:11:10,910 --> 02:11:13,760
And he said,
the number one thing you do is when you,

2891
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:17,570
the gun,
the gun barrel always points to,

2892
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:18,940
because what happens is he said,
you know,

2893
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:21,080
people pick it up and start doing yeah,
yeah.

2894
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:24,110
Gesture with it.
And so and so to sort of make sure that

2895
02:11:24,111 --> 02:11:26,210
I wouldn't commit such an error.
I said,

2896
02:11:26,211 --> 02:11:29,510
here's what we're going to institute as
I do every action.

2897
02:11:29,810 --> 02:11:33,200
I am verbally going to describe it.
Ah,

2898
02:11:33,201 --> 02:11:36,530
that's smart.
And that really sort of soften us.

2899
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:38,810
Why should that the fear?
Because then he's listening.

2900
02:11:38,990 --> 02:11:39,823
Okay,
I'm not cut.

2901
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:42,350
For example,
he told me after you shoot,

2902
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:47,000
take your finger out of the trigger.
It's a trigger discipline.

2903
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:50,540
Exactly.
So then I would speak it and by speaking

2904
02:11:50,541 --> 02:11:53,060
it,
it sort of gave me the discipline to

2905
02:11:53,061 --> 02:11:54,680
never make an error.
But anyways,

2906
02:11:54,681 --> 02:11:56,860
it was a very smart,
they should actually teach people to

2907
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:57,740
think.
So yeah,

2908
02:11:57,770 --> 02:12:01,160
I think that your method is probably
something that people should adopt as

2909
02:12:01,161 --> 02:12:02,870
very intelligent.
You know where it comes from,

2910
02:12:02,871 --> 02:12:04,910
actually it comes from some of my
research.

2911
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:05,660
There's,
there's a,

2912
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:08,480
there's a methodology called verbal
protocols.

2913
02:12:08,830 --> 02:12:12,440
So what when you're doing research,
you could either ask people to fill out

2914
02:12:12,441 --> 02:12:14,540
something.
So that's where you're only interested

2915
02:12:14,541 --> 02:12:15,920
in the output,
right?

2916
02:12:16,490 --> 02:12:19,430
Please watch this stimulus and tell me
on a scale what you think,

2917
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:22,400
right?
Or sometimes I'm interested in the

2918
02:12:22,401 --> 02:12:26,150
process that you're going through as
you're doing something.

2919
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:29,900
So in that case,
I will have a recorder and I will ask

2920
02:12:29,901 --> 02:12:34,040
for your verbal protocols.
Verbalize what you're doing as you're

2921
02:12:34,041 --> 02:12:37,610
doing it.
What that does is it basically yields

2922
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:39,860
very rich data,
but that,

2923
02:12:39,861 --> 02:12:44,861
that is a real bitch to analyze because
you're not analyzing numbers on a scale

2924
02:12:44,931 --> 02:12:47,080
of one to seven,
you're not agonizing,

2925
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:49,040
uh,
spikes of testosterone.

2926
02:12:49,041 --> 02:12:53,390
You actually have to go through these
huge transcripts of verbalizations.

2927
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:56,630
You know what it also does,
it forces you to exist in the conscious

2928
02:12:56,631 --> 02:13:01,160
mind versus the reactive mind.
You are consciously engaging in a

2929
02:13:01,161 --> 02:13:03,650
process.
So like there's a,

2930
02:13:03,651 --> 02:13:05,840
there's a thing called target panic that
many,

2931
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:08,660
uh,
archer's a face and a,

2932
02:13:08,661 --> 02:13:12,680
it's a huge issue because of nerves,
especially people that aren't used to

2933
02:13:12,681 --> 02:13:14,450
um,
performing under nerves.

2934
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:19,720
They go into this really almost like a
tunnel vision sort of estate and they

2935
02:13:21,291 --> 02:13:25,190
start panicking and they just want to
shoot the shot as quick as possible.

2936
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:27,450
And so they make a lot of errors that
make a lot of,

2937
02:13:27,490 --> 02:13:29,390
cause.
There's a lot of things involved in

2938
02:13:29,391 --> 02:13:32,090
shooting a bow and Arrow correctly,
bowen arrows.

2939
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:34,530
It's so,
it takes so much more disciplined than

2940
02:13:34,531 --> 02:13:37,110
it does to shoot a rifle because of the
rifle.

2941
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:40,350
Essentially what you have to do is have
your face in the proper position,

2942
02:13:40,351 --> 02:13:42,070
put your finger on the trigger and
squeeze.

2943
02:13:42,071 --> 02:13:44,610
So the shot goes off almost as a
surprise.

2944
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,130
And if as long as you're looking through
the,

2945
02:13:47,430 --> 02:13:48,750
um,
the scope correctly,

2946
02:13:48,751 --> 02:13:51,960
you have your,
your rifle centered in or you have a,

2947
02:13:51,961 --> 02:13:53,110
your rifle,
um,

2948
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:56,670
cited incorrectly,
it should hit where you want to aim it.

2949
02:13:56,671 --> 02:13:59,430
If the rifle was accurate with a bow and
Arrow,

2950
02:13:59,431 --> 02:14:01,650
there's so many different anchor points.
The,

2951
02:14:01,651 --> 02:14:03,750
you have to have the string touching the
tip of your nose.

2952
02:14:03,751 --> 02:14:05,970
You have to have your hand the exact
same place every time.

2953
02:14:05,971 --> 02:14:07,800
You have to have practice countless
times.

2954
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:10,370
You have to make sure that you're
holding your shoulder,

2955
02:14:10,380 --> 02:14:12,480
your front shoulder,
and the right position in your hand has

2956
02:14:12,481 --> 02:14:15,000
to be holding the bone,
a very specific position where you're

2957
02:14:15,001 --> 02:14:16,560
not talking the bowl left and right.

2958
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:19,290
And so when you go through your shot
process,

2959
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:24,180
you go through these,
this checkpoint in your mind,

2960
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:28,320
very like I tell when I do it by myself,
I say it,

2961
02:14:28,710 --> 02:14:29,730
I say,
okay,

2962
02:14:29,790 --> 02:14:32,250
and the right position,
front shoulder position,

2963
02:14:32,251 --> 02:14:34,560
and say it in your mind.
Say it out loud.

2964
02:14:34,561 --> 02:14:35,700
Okay.
I say it out loud.

2965
02:14:35,701 --> 02:14:38,850
And then when I go through it in a,
in a hunting scenario where obviously

2966
02:14:38,851 --> 02:14:42,390
you have to keep your mouth shut,
I go through that same checklist in my

2967
02:14:42,391 --> 02:14:47,391
mind and that sort of in many ways
prevents a lot of the panic because um,

2968
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:51,450
that sort of panic exists in the
conscious mind.

2969
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:52,980
You Start Thinking,
oh my God,

2970
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:53,850
here we go.
Oh my God,

2971
02:14:53,851 --> 02:14:55,560
I can't believe it's happening.
Don't fuck this up.

2972
02:14:55,561 --> 02:14:56,610
Don't fuck this up.
Ah,

2973
02:14:56,611 --> 02:15:00,420
you fuck it up.
And it's because of this reaction to the

2974
02:15:00,421 --> 02:15:04,650
overwhelming,
unusual stimulation of the event,

2975
02:15:04,890 --> 02:15:09,060
of the panic sets in.
And you succumb to that unusual

2976
02:15:09,061 --> 02:15:09,890
pressure.

2977
02:15:09,890 --> 02:15:12,570
Yeah.
So the portal causes,

2978
02:15:12,610 --> 02:15:16,050
I'm talking about the income of two
varieties is what's called concurrent

2979
02:15:16,051 --> 02:15:21,000
protocols or retro spective protocols.
Concurrent protocols is where you

2980
02:15:21,001 --> 02:15:24,020
verbalize as you're doing the task,
the,

2981
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:26,190
the,
the benefit of that is that it's,

2982
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:27,330
it's live,
it's,

2983
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:28,730
it's top of mind,
right?

2984
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:35,090
The downside is that sometimes by asking
a participant to verbalize,

2985
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:38,880
it actually changes their cognitive
process.

2986
02:15:38,881 --> 02:15:42,300
Sure.
So then you might go to retrospective

2987
02:15:42,570 --> 02:15:46,560
protocol,
which is now tell me in details how you

2988
02:15:46,561 --> 02:15:49,560
did the thing.
And now the benefit there is that you

2989
02:15:49,561 --> 02:15:50,710
don't have that,
uh,

2990
02:15:50,910 --> 02:15:51,743
that,
uh,

2991
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:54,270
interference.
But the downside of course,

2992
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:57,390
is that you have memory loss.
You don't remember the specifics.

2993
02:15:57,630 --> 02:16:00,450
Or you also have people who fill in
stuff.

2994
02:16:00,451 --> 02:16:01,284
That's bullshit,
right?

2995
02:16:01,730 --> 02:16:04,530
Oh,
now the guy wants me to justify how I

2996
02:16:04,531 --> 02:16:07,170
went and did it.
Now let me just fill in stuff.

2997
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:10,500
But that's not really what I did.
So as is true in most of these

2998
02:16:10,501 --> 02:16:13,500
methodological choices,
when you're making these scientific

2999
02:16:13,501 --> 02:16:17,070
decisions,
there is no absolute optimal strategy.

3000
02:16:17,071 --> 02:16:20,310
There's always pros and cons to any
methodology you use.

3001
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:22,620
Yeah,
and I think there's also something that

3002
02:16:22,621 --> 02:16:26,020
happens to people when they do something
so many times where it becomes a

3003
02:16:26,021 --> 02:16:27,520
subconscious action.
Right?

3004
02:16:27,630 --> 02:16:30,400
And then when you ask him to verbalize
what the steps are,

3005
02:16:30,610 --> 02:16:33,850
oftentimes they don't know because
they've programmed it into their mind

3006
02:16:33,851 --> 02:16:37,270
like electricity.
If I asked you to describe in exact

3007
02:16:37,271 --> 02:16:39,910
detail what is the process that you tie
your shoes with?

3008
02:16:40,090 --> 02:16:41,920
Right?
Like which hand goes first,

3009
02:16:41,921 --> 02:16:44,080
which finger goes under,
where you'd be like,

3010
02:16:44,110 --> 02:16:45,670
um,
how do I do it?

3011
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:48,340
Okay,
I take the,

3012
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:50,240
but when you tie your shoes,
you just go,

3013
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:51,630
Bro,
whoops.

3014
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:52,983
Caught it.
Right.

3015
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:55,570
You know,
you just go through this storm standard

3016
02:16:55,571 --> 02:16:57,400
process.
If that happens with martial artists a

3017
02:16:57,401 --> 02:16:59,230
lot,
there's a lot of martial artists that

3018
02:16:59,231 --> 02:17:01,960
have certain techniques that they've
gotten down to a science.

3019
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:04,240
But then when you ask them to teach it,
you say,

3020
02:17:04,241 --> 02:17:05,650
okay,
what are you doing first?

3021
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:06,910
Are you doing this first shot?
And they go,

3022
02:17:06,911 --> 02:17:07,940
Huh,
um,

3023
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:10,240
I'm not sure.
And they literally don't know.

3024
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:12,910
I've,
I've talked to that with certain archers

3025
02:17:12,911 --> 02:17:14,980
to certain artists.
I've asked them,

3026
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:19,480
are you looking at the,
the site first or are you looking at the

3027
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:21,910
target first?
We know when you released the Arrow,

3028
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:23,290
are you looking at the target or the
site?

3029
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:26,710
They don't know.
You don't know where it falls into this

3030
02:17:26,711 --> 02:17:29,890
sort of subconscious state where they've
made repetition.

3031
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:32,680
So they've,
they've repeated the process so many

3032
02:17:32,681 --> 02:17:36,550
times they've made this repetition
cemented in their subconscious where

3033
02:17:36,551 --> 02:17:38,950
they could just just sort of go into
this Zombie state.

3034
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:39,831
You know,
it's funny,

3035
02:17:39,831 --> 02:17:43,010
I,
I felt that recently trying to play

3036
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:45,520
pickup soccer.
Ah,

3037
02:17:46,150 --> 02:17:49,130
it's going to speak to that authenticity
and exactly how you're saying.

3038
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:52,250
So when I was a young guy,
young player who can,

3039
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:54,830
you know,
accelerate past players as if it's

3040
02:17:54,831 --> 02:17:56,810
nothing,
it's a natural thing.

3041
02:17:56,870 --> 02:17:59,870
I don't think about it.
My Body reacts and if you asked me to

3042
02:17:59,871 --> 02:18:04,280
tell you how I shifted left and right,
I couldn't tell you now is a much older

3043
02:18:04,281 --> 02:18:07,910
and much heavier.
Those moves that I tried to do,

3044
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I no longer had the automatic ability.
So actually my brain was trying to

3045
02:18:13,341 --> 02:18:14,180
think,
oh,

3046
02:18:14,181 --> 02:18:17,570
I better turn right,
but be careful because my knee is a bit

3047
02:18:17,571 --> 02:18:21,680
weak.
And so I actually felt the difference

3048
02:18:22,010 --> 02:18:24,670
and the automaticity response,
Ah,

3049
02:18:24,710 --> 02:18:27,830
if only by virtue of being much older
and much heavier.

3050
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:29,510
Right?
So there you go.

3051
02:18:29,511 --> 02:18:33,590
20 years ago I could have probably not
been able to tell you how I did this

3052
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:35,750
today.
I could tell you how I did it because it

3053
02:18:35,751 --> 02:18:38,200
was a slow as a turtle.
Ah,

3054
02:18:38,210 --> 02:18:39,043
that's funny.

3055
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:40,590
Well,
that exists in a,

3056
02:18:40,591 --> 02:18:44,060
in fighting for sure.
You drill these moments over and over

3057
02:18:44,061 --> 02:18:46,220
into your mind so that when you're
fighting,

3058
02:18:46,221 --> 02:18:48,920
they actually just come out
subconsciously or they come out without

3059
02:18:48,921 --> 02:18:52,100
conscious thought because you don't
really have the time to say,

3060
02:18:52,310 --> 02:18:54,800
okay,
I'm going to slip this right hand and

3061
02:18:54,801 --> 02:18:56,140
throw the left to the body.
The,

3062
02:18:56,210 --> 02:18:57,440
the,
the right high kick.

3063
02:18:57,441 --> 02:19:00,170
It has to sort of be an automatic
response,

3064
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:01,940
right?
So you have to be able to go into this

3065
02:19:01,941 --> 02:19:06,860
zen state,
which is fine in these big movements.

3066
02:19:06,861 --> 02:19:09,230
He's explosive movements like a martial
arts thing.

3067
02:19:09,410 --> 02:19:12,950
But in terms of like an archery thing,
you don't want fast,

3068
02:19:12,951 --> 02:19:16,010
big twitching,
explosive movements to come out

3069
02:19:16,011 --> 02:19:18,710
automatically.
What you want is a very controlled

3070
02:19:18,711 --> 02:19:22,550
process.
Will you maintain very strict form and

3071
02:19:22,551 --> 02:19:25,730
you stay calm.
And so when that sort of a process going

3072
02:19:25,731 --> 02:19:29,990
over this conscious shot making process
is probably better for you.

3073
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:30,913
Right.
Cool.

3074
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:32,810
Are you still fighting?
No.

3075
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:34,910
No.
That's really not good for,

3076
02:19:34,911 --> 02:19:36,990
you know what I mean?
Even as a spotter,

3077
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:39,420
Jujitsu only,
you know,

3078
02:19:39,430 --> 02:19:41,240
that's,
and I haven't done that in over a year.

3079
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:43,220
Okay.
But it's just because of a back injury

3080
02:19:43,221 --> 02:19:45,710
that I've been dealing with,
but it's pretty much gone now.

3081
02:19:45,890 --> 02:19:48,350
But sparring as far as like kickboxing,
sparring,

3082
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:50,120
I gave that up many,
many years ago.

3083
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:53,800
It's just even sparring for fun.
Even just a,

3084
02:19:53,980 --> 02:19:57,920
even you have to like really be sure of
the person you're doing it with because

3085
02:19:57,921 --> 02:20:02,120
every single time you get tagged,
if you looked at your body or your brain

3086
02:20:02,121 --> 02:20:03,660
rather as um,
uh,

3087
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:06,230
a punch card,
like say you have a hundred holes to

3088
02:20:06,231 --> 02:20:08,300
punch and once you punch through those
hundred holes,

3089
02:20:08,630 --> 02:20:09,720
you're fucked.
Right.

3090
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:11,360
And you might get away with a couple of
holes.

3091
02:20:11,361 --> 02:20:15,380
You might get away with three or four or
five or 10 or 20.

3092
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:17,120
This is the whole nfl.
Yeah,

3093
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:19,100
it had been 100%,
100% and,

3094
02:20:19,430 --> 02:20:22,670
but it pertains to a lot of things.
And even soccer players would the head,

3095
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:24,140
the heading,
which is insane,

3096
02:20:24,190 --> 02:20:26,420
you would never meet.
Imagine like for years,

3097
02:20:26,421 --> 02:20:27,380
for decades,
rather,

3098
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:31,010
we had no idea that heading a ball could
have detrimental effects.

3099
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:35,000
But now we're finding out that certain
soccer players who consistently headed

3100
02:20:35,001 --> 02:20:40,001
the ball over a long career develop all
sorts of cognitive issues with memory,

3101
02:20:40,370 --> 02:20:42,980
impulsiveness,
all the same sort of symptoms that I

3102
02:20:42,981 --> 02:20:44,690
find from fighters.
Incredible.

3103
02:20:44,810 --> 02:20:46,850
It's amazing because it's not a
concussion thing.

3104
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:50,690
It's a sub concussive trauma thing where
you're constantly engaging that

3105
02:20:50,870 --> 02:20:54,560
connective tissue inside your brain to
try to stabilize the brain.

3106
02:20:54,561 --> 02:20:58,360
Is it swashes around inside your skull
and it starts failing and then the,

3107
02:20:58,361 --> 02:21:01,970
the damage of your brain moving around
inside of there starts accumulating.

3108
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:06,500
Speaking of soccer and your mma stuff,
I'm triggered by,

3109
02:21:06,770 --> 02:21:10,040
and you're going to be interest Konan
Konan Mcgregor,

3110
02:21:10,860 --> 02:21:11,681
connor,
connor,

3111
02:21:11,681 --> 02:21:12,800
connor,
connor.

3112
02:21:12,801 --> 02:21:14,300
What happened?
I'm going to get a thousand.

3113
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:16,610
He,
I was trying to be impressive.

3114
02:21:16,611 --> 02:21:20,600
Wait for the [inaudible] being nice to
me.

3115
02:21:20,930 --> 02:21:23,300
They're not going to be made,
but it's going to be all whatever colon

3116
02:21:23,301 --> 02:21:24,290
man,
conor,

3117
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:25,880
conor Mcgregor,
conor Mcgregor,

3118
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:28,100
I'm triggered by him.
Triggered because,

3119
02:21:28,120 --> 02:21:32,180
oh,
he's a friend of the nemesis of my top

3120
02:21:32,181 --> 02:21:34,520
man.
He's a friend of Ronaldo.

3121
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:36,310
Oh,
the soccer players channel.

3122
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:41,320
Rinaldo apparently is their buddy buddy,
Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi had

3123
02:21:41,601 --> 02:21:46,601
been trust that you now know who he is.
I also know that he's a tax cheat.

3124
02:21:48,850 --> 02:21:50,450
Motherfuckers going to jail isn't,
ain't no,

3125
02:21:50,451 --> 02:21:52,190
he's not going to jail.
No.

3126
02:21:52,191 --> 02:21:54,980
I think Jamie says he's going to,
the pokey says is going to get banked.

3127
02:21:55,430 --> 02:21:57,480
So Dude's going to bang them.
There is.

3128
02:21:58,490 --> 02:21:59,690
Wow.
By the way,

3129
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:03,370
I will gentleman's in great shape.
I will ask you to look at it.

3130
02:22:03,470 --> 02:22:08,470
Can you put it up again?
I'm going to show you in 1985 pictures

3131
02:22:08,511 --> 02:22:12,650
of me with more defined.
I will show you photos.

3132
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:13,880
Egos,
so showcase.

3133
02:22:13,881 --> 02:22:16,030
How dare you.
Godfather.

3134
02:22:16,190 --> 02:22:17,390
It doesn't matter.
By the way,

3135
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:20,390
you live in the present right now.
You've got a one pass.

3136
02:22:20,391 --> 02:22:21,680
Gloria,
you had a barrel.

3137
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:23,990
Let it go.
The six pack is gone.

3138
02:22:24,950 --> 02:22:26,040
You we get it back

3139
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,060
though.
That's what we should do.

3140
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:29,620
The Dad sad six pack project.
Yeah,

3141
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:32,550
and you sort of fill me as I go through
the transformation.

3142
02:22:32,551 --> 02:22:33,900
I'm not going to do it.
You're going to do it on your own.

3143
02:22:33,901 --> 02:22:34,734
I'm busy,
Bro.

3144
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:36,690
How dare you.
I'm reaching out.

3145
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:38,520
Infection.
This is how you treat me.

3146
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:41,790
I'm going to get you a copy of the book.
I'm gonna get you a copy of the primal

3147
02:22:41,791 --> 02:22:42,870
blueprint.
Yeah,

3148
02:22:42,871 --> 02:22:44,190
I can't.
I can't hold your hand,

3149
02:22:44,191 --> 02:22:45,450
man.
If you're a grown man,

3150
02:22:45,451 --> 02:22:46,650
you're older than me.
He called me son.

3151
02:22:46,651 --> 02:22:48,930
Remember you're,
you're not 50 yet.

3152
02:22:48,931 --> 02:22:49,561
Oh yeah.
No,

3153
02:22:49,561 --> 02:22:51,390
49 just turned.
Oh yeah,

3154
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:53,130
that's right.
Happy Birthday.

3155
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:56,100
The slide is real.
I'm 51 so I'm already,

3156
02:22:56,280 --> 02:22:58,950
I'm on the downside.
So when it makes it even more difficult

3157
02:22:58,951 --> 02:23:00,810
to lose weight,
you're more set in your ways.

3158
02:23:00,811 --> 02:23:05,811
Your hormone system starts Sulu and
does your metabolism slowing down?

3159
02:23:08,890 --> 02:23:09,900
We've got to ramp it up,
buddy.

3160
02:23:09,930 --> 02:23:11,580
I do.
You got to start off your day with

3161
02:23:11,581 --> 02:23:12,990
exercise too.
So are you,

3162
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:16,910
are you currently at the same weight as
you would have been 20 years ago or no,

3163
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:19,950
I'm heavier but more muscle because I've
been lifting weights with the last,

3164
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:22,140
when I got into Jujitsu like really
heavily,

3165
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:27,560
which was about 2000 right around the
year 2000 I started training in 96 but I

3166
02:23:29,911 --> 02:23:34,911
got really into it around 2000 so over
the last 16 plus years I've been lifting

3167
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:38,220
way more weights,
like are really good in the lifting

3168
02:23:38,221 --> 02:23:42,300
weights because I realized how
significant it is a factor and also to

3169
02:23:42,301 --> 02:23:44,490
protect your joints.
That's a big factor too.

3170
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:46,850
Just the,
the ability to uh,

3171
02:23:47,370 --> 02:23:49,470
defend yourself better.
You know,

3172
02:23:49,471 --> 02:23:51,810
I,
I do a lot of long endurance,

3173
02:23:51,830 --> 02:23:53,310
you know,
an hour cardio,

3174
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:56,210
but I've always been terrible a lot of
ways.

3175
02:23:56,760 --> 02:23:59,730
How often do you do self tape?
I've been here for a month in

3176
02:23:59,731 --> 02:24:01,350
California,
so 30 days.

3177
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:03,210
I probably did have 24 days.
Wow.

3178
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:04,380
Yeah.
That's amazing.

3179
02:24:04,381 --> 02:24:05,490
Yeah.
What do you do afterwards?

3180
02:24:05,491 --> 02:24:07,750
Just so I'll usually do,
uh,

3181
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:10,620
an hour,
either treadmill or bike or a

3182
02:24:10,621 --> 02:24:12,420
combination,
sometimes elliptical.

3183
02:24:12,421 --> 02:24:14,400
So these three are usually,
what time do you do it?

3184
02:24:14,401 --> 02:24:15,620
Do you do in the morning and going,
oh,

3185
02:24:15,621 --> 02:24:16,291
that's good.
In the morning,

3186
02:24:16,291 --> 02:24:17,890
but not very early.
Maybe say.

3187
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:19,650
And you do an hour.
I do an hour.

3188
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:20,700
That's a lot,
man.

3189
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:22,860
That's really good.
It's cause I was coming on your show.

3190
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:24,330
Uh,
but uh,

3191
02:24:24,390 --> 02:24:28,830
I usually do about an hour and now here
in California I've tried to incorporate

3192
02:24:28,860 --> 02:24:33,180
weight training usually back home.
I don't as I understand that I need to

3193
02:24:33,181 --> 02:24:36,300
do it more so.
Well I would say that weight training

3194
02:24:36,301 --> 02:24:38,790
definitely makes your body burn more
calories,

3195
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:39,683
that's for sure.

3196
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:41,490
And two for two reasons.
One,

3197
02:24:41,491 --> 02:24:45,900
because when you put on more muscle,
your body has more requirements for for

3198
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:48,210
calories,
so it's easier for your body to burn

3199
02:24:48,211 --> 02:24:51,990
more fuel if you have more muscle.
The act of lifting weights is very

3200
02:24:51,991 --> 02:24:55,980
strenuous,
burns a lot of calories and a it also,

3201
02:24:55,981 --> 02:24:58,050
it's just,
it's just really good for your endocrine

3202
02:24:58,051 --> 02:25:01,320
system when you start lifting weights,
especially if you do things like

3203
02:25:01,321 --> 02:25:03,750
deadlifts or squats.
I can't do any of that stuff cause I

3204
02:25:03,751 --> 02:25:05,670
have three herniated disks in my back.
You do,

3205
02:25:06,470 --> 02:25:11,340
so I'll try with your back.
What's going not actually about 2005 we

3206
02:25:11,341 --> 02:25:16,341
were moving from one house to another.
I've got a huge library books and I'm

3207
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:18,690
going to say this will become evident in
a second.

3208
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:23,680
As you know,
book boxes are deceptive and that they

3209
02:25:23,681 --> 02:25:24,250
look like

3210
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,680
they're small volume but they are
extremely heavy.

3211
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:29,860
I went to pick one up and I did the
wrong emotion.

3212
02:25:29,950 --> 02:25:34,090
I felt my back and then after that it
would just flare up maybe once a year

3213
02:25:34,450 --> 02:25:38,800
and about four years ago I went down to
bend down and then I was basically

3214
02:25:38,801 --> 02:25:42,490
immobilized for what part of your back?
It's the left side through your lower

3215
02:25:42,491 --> 02:25:43,740
back.
Back there.

3216
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:46,540
Three herniated this.
So I went to see a physiatrist and

3217
02:25:46,541 --> 02:25:48,940
here's his advice.
Never bend again.

3218
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,240
Well those people are dipshits.
There's so many doctors.

3219
02:25:52,241 --> 02:25:53,920
It'll tell you don't do this and don't
do that.

3220
02:25:53,921 --> 02:25:58,921
I went to a doctor in 2002 because I had
a torn meniscus,

3221
02:25:59,110 --> 02:26:01,450
just a torn meniscus,
really simple injury for someone as a

3222
02:26:01,451 --> 02:26:06,451
martial artist and uh,
they told me to stop doing martial arts.

3223
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,740
They literally told me,
you're going to be a cripple if you

3224
02:26:08,741 --> 02:26:08,950
start.

3225
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:10,900
You don't stop doing martial arts.
I'm like,

3226
02:26:10,901 --> 02:26:11,734
yeah,
okay.

3227
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:14,260
What the fuck?
Kind of stupid advices that I'm like,

3228
02:26:14,261 --> 02:26:16,560
just scope this God damn thing and let
me get outta here.

3229
02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:18,790
Right.
I got back on [inaudible] and

3230
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:23,320
glucosamine.
I ate a lot of fish oil and I've had no

3231
02:26:23,321 --> 02:26:27,010
problem with that knee since then.
Like they scoped out a chunk of

3232
02:26:27,011 --> 02:26:29,440
Meniscus,
which is really common with people that

3233
02:26:29,441 --> 02:26:32,650
have extreme athletic pursuits,
whether it's soccer,

3234
02:26:32,651 --> 02:26:34,080
soccer,
La guys are cheering,

3235
02:26:34,150 --> 02:26:35,470
you know,
martial arts.

3236
02:26:35,471 --> 02:26:36,221
It's a big,
it's,

3237
02:26:36,221 --> 02:26:40,480
it's normal thing that they do.
But to have this asshole tell me to stop

3238
02:26:40,481 --> 02:26:42,010
doing martial arts,
I'm going to be cripple.

3239
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:43,750
I've just,
I just wanted to just say,

3240
02:26:43,751 --> 02:26:45,280
look,
you're a fucking asshole.

3241
02:26:45,281 --> 02:26:48,490
Like you really have no,
no qualifications to be saying this.

3242
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:50,740
Like this is foolish.
You're fixed injuries.

3243
02:26:50,741 --> 02:26:55,741
You can't tell me that if I don't listen
to your stupid lazy advice.

3244
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:58,800
It's just such a dumb thing to say to
people be,

3245
02:26:58,870 --> 02:27:01,090
especially when you're talking about a
meniscus injury,

3246
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:04,810
you're not talking about a severe spinal
injury where someone could become

3247
02:27:04,811 --> 02:27:07,420
paralyzed if they continue the same
thing that they're doing.

3248
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:09,340
Now you're talking about a meniscus
tear,

3249
02:27:09,430 --> 02:27:10,480
right?
It's really simple.

3250
02:27:10,510 --> 02:27:12,370
Not only that,
they have artificial meniscus now,

3251
02:27:12,371 --> 02:27:15,550
now they do stem cells that actually
regenerate meniscus.

3252
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,890
By the way,
stem cell research is another one that

3253
02:27:17,891 --> 02:27:19,440
those forbidden knowledge,
uh,

3254
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:23,980
topics because of,
well it was way more now because they

3255
02:27:23,981 --> 02:27:26,470
found so many different methods of
acquiring stem cells.

3256
02:27:26,471 --> 02:27:28,460
But yeah,
but during the Bush administration,

3257
02:27:28,461 --> 02:27:31,420
I was hugely problematic and that's one
of the reasons why Europe got so far

3258
02:27:31,421 --> 02:27:32,440
ahead of America.
It's true.

3259
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:34,220
And there's a lot of,
uh,

3260
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:36,550
people that go to get certain
treatments.

3261
02:27:36,551 --> 02:27:37,250
They got,
they,

3262
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:38,890
they had to go to other countries.

3263
02:27:39,130 --> 02:27:44,050
Fortunately now there's a lot of stem
cell doctors and specialists that are in

3264
02:27:44,070 --> 02:27:47,410
United States that are having incredible
success with injuries.

3265
02:27:47,411 --> 02:27:49,090
And a lot of mixed martial artists do it
right.

3266
02:27:49,550 --> 02:27:51,400
Um,
Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson is the

3267
02:27:51,401 --> 02:27:52,810
best pound for pound fighter in the
world.

3268
02:27:52,811 --> 02:27:54,910
Just had some stem cells shot into his
knee.

3269
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:56,570
Um,
so it's,

3270
02:27:56,590 --> 02:27:59,160
this is a really common thing that
you're,

3271
02:27:59,161 --> 02:28:01,600
you,
you deal with some doctors who aren't

3272
02:28:01,601 --> 02:28:04,120
athletes,
don't work with athletes and then they

3273
02:28:04,121 --> 02:28:06,160
tell you things like,
don't ever lift something again.

3274
02:28:06,460 --> 02:28:10,060
That is crazy.
That is a crazy piece of conceivable.

3275
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:11,620
100%.
Yes.

3276
02:28:11,621 --> 02:28:13,450
I'm going to show you a machine.
When we get off today,

3277
02:28:13,451 --> 02:28:14,500
we'll,
I'll show you in a couple of minutes

3278
02:28:14,501 --> 02:28:16,630
because we're gonna end soon where
there's a machine that I have in the

3279
02:28:16,631 --> 02:28:19,350
back called the reverse hyper and it was
created by this guy.

3280
02:28:19,390 --> 02:28:21,800
I've talked about this so many times,
people like not again,

3281
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:24,050
but it's created by this guy named Louie
Simmons.

3282
02:28:24,050 --> 02:28:28,460
And Louie Simmons is this guy who runs
this very famous powerlifting gym called

3283
02:28:28,461 --> 02:28:32,420
Westside Barbell.
And he had a bulging disc himself and

3284
02:28:32,421 --> 02:28:35,150
his doctors are telling them they're
going to have to fuse your disc and you

3285
02:28:35,151 --> 02:28:36,380
know you're going to have to have an
operation.

3286
02:28:36,390 --> 02:28:37,223
He was like,
what?

3287
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:40,640
And he couldn't,
as a person who is an expert in

3288
02:28:40,641 --> 02:28:42,880
physiology and a person who is an expert
in a,

3289
02:28:42,881 --> 02:28:45,680
in exercise and,
and teaching people how to get strong,

3290
02:28:45,860 --> 02:28:50,860
he couldn't understand why if an injury,
a compression of the disc,

3291
02:28:51,081 --> 02:28:54,920
cause the disc to herniate,
why couldn't a decompression of the disk

3292
02:28:54,950 --> 02:28:58,880
cause it to reset or to heal?
So he developed this machine that does

3293
02:28:58,881 --> 02:29:01,070
exactly that.
It's called the reverse hyper.

3294
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:04,760
And I have one of these in the back.
So you see when he's lifting the weights

3295
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:06,530
up,
it's strengthening the back.

3296
02:29:06,531 --> 02:29:10,970
When the weights go down,
it's actually pulling the back apart.

3297
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:15,140
It's slowly decompressing the back in an
active form.

3298
02:29:15,230 --> 02:29:17,720
But has there been,
have there been any studies that show

3299
02:29:17,721 --> 02:29:20,190
that if you use this,
your herniated disc

3300
02:29:21,810 --> 02:29:25,340
he himself has done,
I mean no peer reviewed studies,

3301
02:29:25,341 --> 02:29:30,260
but athletes have used this time and
time again along with decompression.

3302
02:29:30,261 --> 02:29:32,600
Spinal decompression is also really
important.

3303
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:35,840
Spinal decompression meaning like
hanging from your ankles,

3304
02:29:35,841 --> 02:29:38,060
hanging from your waist.
I have a couple of different devices in

3305
02:29:38,061 --> 02:29:42,230
the back that I can show you that allow
you to relax your back and yoga is also

3306
02:29:42,231 --> 02:29:44,630
critical.
Yoga is huge because there's a bunch of

3307
02:29:44,631 --> 02:29:49,130
positions in yoga where you are actively
decompressing your back.

3308
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:52,730
There's one where you reach back,
you grab yourself behind the heels,

3309
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:56,900
you straighten your legs out and you
literally are pulling with your arms and

3310
02:29:56,901 --> 02:29:58,670
you feel your back all like pop,
pop,

3311
02:29:58,671 --> 02:30:01,970
pop.
You're releasing tension and pressure

3312
02:30:01,971 --> 02:30:03,680
and you're actively stretching your
back.

3313
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:07,760
So I'm walking out of here invigorated
by our chat and filled with hope and

3314
02:30:07,761 --> 02:30:09,900
optimism about diet,
exercise size.

3315
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:10,551
You know,
me,

3316
02:30:10,551 --> 02:30:12,080
nothing my friend.
But I,

3317
02:30:12,081 --> 02:30:14,660
it's,
it's really important for people to work

3318
02:30:14,661 --> 02:30:17,330
on their core and their spine and
there's so many people that don't.

3319
02:30:17,360 --> 02:30:19,040
I have a friend of mine was just big,
strong,

3320
02:30:19,041 --> 02:30:21,050
powerful guy and uh,
you know,

3321
02:30:21,051 --> 02:30:24,590
he played football and he's done a bunch
of different things but he's never done

3322
02:30:24,591 --> 02:30:29,210
any like real significant core work.
And I started showing him some different

3323
02:30:29,211 --> 02:30:32,870
exercises like windmills and things
along those lines and he was stunned at

3324
02:30:32,871 --> 02:30:37,130
how weak his lower back is because so
many people don't work those muscles.

3325
02:30:37,131 --> 02:30:39,590
And those muscles are critical for
athletic performance,

3326
02:30:39,591 --> 02:30:43,760
for your ability to move and to protect
your spine from injury.

3327
02:30:43,761 --> 02:30:47,870
There's a lot of injuries that you can
avoid by just being strong in your core

3328
02:30:47,871 --> 02:30:50,960
and your column,
your spinal column and d developing

3329
02:30:50,961 --> 02:30:53,330
strength around the,
you know,

3330
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:56,900
that whole really super sensitive and
delicate area of your back.

3331
02:30:57,650 --> 02:30:59,720
But decompression is real.
Um,

3332
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:01,820
there's a bunch of machines that doctors
have,

3333
02:31:01,821 --> 02:31:03,160
and when I hurt my neck,
uh,

3334
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:05,570
one of the things that I did is went to
this doctor that would,

3335
02:31:05,630 --> 02:31:07,850
they would have this machine.
It kind of straps you in.

3336
02:31:07,880 --> 02:31:10,370
It just gives you this gentle poles and
it's sort of like,

3337
02:31:10,371 --> 02:31:12,470
what about the upside down world?
I have the one of those two.

3338
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,473
Yeah,
those are good.

3339
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:14,480
Those are good.
Those are good.

3340
02:31:14,481 --> 02:31:16,580
But you have to learn how to really
relax your back.

3341
02:31:16,610 --> 02:31:18,350
A lot of people,
when they hang by their angles,

3342
02:31:18,351 --> 02:31:20,760
they tend to up and it sort of defeats
the purpose,

3343
02:31:20,790 --> 02:31:21,950
right?
You have to learn it,

3344
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:25,530
you have to learn it.
And it feels weird.

3345
02:31:25,531 --> 02:31:27,690
Like you could feel yourself pulling
apart,

3346
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:29,400
right?
But you have to relax that.

3347
02:31:29,430 --> 02:31:32,940
You have to allow that to happen and you
have to do it really consistently.

3348
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:34,890
It has to be something you do all the
time.

3349
02:31:35,070 --> 02:31:37,530
It can't be something you do like once
every now and again,

3350
02:31:37,531 --> 02:31:38,101
like,
oh,

3351
02:31:38,101 --> 02:31:40,680
I'm stretching my back out because it's
going to go right back.

3352
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:44,210
And also posture is significant.
It's a really important part of

3353
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:46,100
[inaudible].
Good.

3354
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:46,921
Yeah.
I mean,

3355
02:31:46,921 --> 02:31:48,570
that's why these chairs that we're
sitting in,

3356
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:49,890
we're sitting in these,
um,

3357
02:31:49,950 --> 02:31:54,750
Ergo depot chairs and these chairs are
designed to make you sit at a good

3358
02:31:54,751 --> 02:31:56,160
posture.
So if you sit like this,

3359
02:31:56,161 --> 02:31:59,130
you'll sit with your spine in a,
in a good position,

3360
02:31:59,430 --> 02:32:02,580
normal chairs.
A lot of times you're back gets rounded

3361
02:32:02,581 --> 02:32:06,240
and you sit into them and he'd sink and
then you developed this pain like right

3362
02:32:06,241 --> 02:32:09,300
around your mid back or maybe perhaps
your lower back depending on the,

3363
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:11,430
you know,
whatever ailments you've got these

3364
02:32:11,431 --> 02:32:13,200
chairs,
I sit in these fucking things for hours.

3365
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:16,080
I don't have any problem.
And I think they're actually in some way

3366
02:32:16,081 --> 02:32:18,660
beneficial because they force a good
posture that actually,

3367
02:32:18,661 --> 02:32:23,310
it's actually like a static exercise.
They think about the standing a working

3368
02:32:23,311 --> 02:32:25,440
desk.
It's better than sitting sometimes,

3369
02:32:25,441 --> 02:32:26,100
you know?
Right.

3370
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:27,270
But I think,
um,

3371
02:32:27,510 --> 02:32:29,130
these things are great.
Like,

3372
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:32,760
because these things force your spinal
column to be in this correct position.

3373
02:32:32,761 --> 02:32:35,100
But I think the standing ones,
a lot of people have a lot of success

3374
02:32:35,101 --> 02:32:36,090
with that.
They also,

3375
02:32:36,091 --> 02:32:38,250
a lot of people have success with those
exercise balls.

3376
02:32:38,490 --> 02:32:40,020
You ever sit on one of those exercise
balls,

3377
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:43,290
they force you to kind of exercise.
Like as you're sitting there,

3378
02:32:43,291 --> 02:32:45,120
you,
you have to kind of be adjust in a

3379
02:32:45,121 --> 02:32:46,230
posture.
Yeah.

3380
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:48,390
There's also a lot of those standing
desks,

3381
02:32:48,630 --> 02:32:51,930
they develop these a standing surfaces
that are,

3382
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:54,630
there are a surface that's very varied.

3383
02:32:54,990 --> 02:32:58,500
So instead of standing on this absolute
flat static,

3384
02:32:58,770 --> 02:33:00,930
um,
sort of a floor while you're in the same

3385
02:33:00,931 --> 02:33:02,460
position all the time,
instead,

3386
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:06,660
it's this dynamic surface where it has
all these humps to it and you move

3387
02:33:06,661 --> 02:33:08,640
around on it lot like,
so you'll,

3388
02:33:08,641 --> 02:33:11,430
you'll like lean on the left leg,
you'll lean on the right leg if you're

3389
02:33:11,431 --> 02:33:13,110
seeing those things.
See if you can find one of those.

3390
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:14,153
Those,
uh,

3391
02:33:14,210 --> 02:33:17,050
surface is standing surfaces,
uh,

3392
02:33:17,070 --> 02:33:19,320
for a standing chairs.
It's really interesting.

3393
02:33:19,321 --> 02:33:22,350
I had a complete rupture,
my achilles tendon when I was a soccer

3394
02:33:22,351 --> 02:33:24,330
player.
And one of the things that I had to do

3395
02:33:24,331 --> 02:33:28,050
in 14 months of Rehab is to stand on one
of those boards with a ball.

3396
02:33:28,270 --> 02:33:33,270
And you had to because just to relearn
how to move in and to adjust.

3397
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:35,460
It's not,
you have to have a repaired surgically.

3398
02:33:36,930 --> 02:33:37,800
That's a big one.
Right.

3399
02:33:38,850 --> 02:33:40,230
That was,
that was finished after that.

3400
02:33:40,350 --> 02:33:41,570
I have one of those,
um,

3401
02:33:41,610 --> 02:33:43,250
in my knee,
I have a,

3402
02:33:43,251 --> 02:33:46,050
an Achilles tendon from a cadaver in my
knee.

3403
02:33:46,620 --> 02:33:47,420
Yeah.
I want to,

3404
02:33:47,420 --> 02:33:50,370
when you get acl surgery,
instead of replacing your acl with a

3405
02:33:50,371 --> 02:33:52,890
cadaver acl,
which is significantly weaker,

3406
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:55,480
they take this,
the acl tendon or,

3407
02:33:55,650 --> 02:33:59,760
and replace it with Achilles,
which is way bigger and way stronger and

3408
02:33:59,761 --> 02:34:04,560
it makes your Achilles' tent where it
makes your acl rather 150% stronger than

3409
02:34:04,580 --> 02:34:05,550
a,
a regular one.

3410
02:34:05,830 --> 02:34:07,770
She goes,
I don't know if you're aware of how it

3411
02:34:07,771 --> 02:34:10,650
works with cadavers,
but when they replace a ligament,

3412
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:15,030
what it does is essentially a acts as a
scaffolding and your body [inaudible]

3413
02:34:15,570 --> 02:34:18,490
this cadaver ligament around your own
cells.

3414
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:23,290
So instead of it being normal size,
it becomes this fat cord that really

3415
02:34:23,291 --> 02:34:24,380
keeps your,
cause.

3416
02:34:24,490 --> 02:34:28,270
I've had both my knees blowout to acl
reconstructions.

3417
02:34:28,330 --> 02:34:29,680
One in each knee.
No,

3418
02:34:29,681 --> 02:34:31,360
that's not it.
There's other ones.

3419
02:34:31,361 --> 02:34:32,860
That's just the chair.
This guy's on.

3420
02:34:32,890 --> 02:34:36,100
It's a standing desk surface,
uh,

3421
02:34:36,350 --> 02:34:38,560
standing surface,
pull up,

3422
02:34:38,561 --> 02:34:40,870
standing surface for,
uh,

3423
02:34:41,170 --> 02:34:45,130
for standing desk or surface for
standing desk.

3424
02:34:45,790 --> 02:34:48,940
Standing desk surface for standing on.
Hmm.

3425
02:34:49,210 --> 02:34:50,210
I don't know.
Uh,

3426
02:34:50,220 --> 02:34:52,450
I bet ergo depot has it.
Well,

3427
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:54,010
there's a bunch of those,
um,

3428
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:59,140
different kinds of standing desks,
but moving surface for standing desk.

3429
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:00,920
I don't know.
Just don't show me this way.

3430
02:35:00,990 --> 02:35:03,820
You're going to go fucking crazy.
But um,

3431
02:35:03,850 --> 02:35:05,170
I don't know.
I don't even know if it's good.

3432
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,170
I just saw that someone developed.
So when I had my,

3433
02:35:08,171 --> 02:35:10,920
a ruptured Achilles tendon,
I'm the trip.

3434
02:35:10,921 --> 02:35:12,880
Have you ever heard somebody describe
what happens?

3435
02:35:13,210 --> 02:35:18,210
You actually feel as if somebody hits
you with a sledgehammer on your Achilles

3436
02:35:19,031 --> 02:35:20,230
tendon.
When it pops,

3437
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:22,300
it feels like you were hit and you,
I mean,

3438
02:35:22,301 --> 02:35:25,660
you drop,
like somebody shot you after the fact.

3439
02:35:25,661 --> 02:35:27,400
So I had the surgery.
This was,

3440
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:30,670
I was a student,
a graduate student at the time at

3441
02:35:30,671 --> 02:35:32,620
Cornell.
I went back to Montreal to have the

3442
02:35:32,621 --> 02:35:33,650
surgery.
When I,

3443
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:37,360
when I went back to Cornell,
I asked my fellow soccer players what

3444
02:35:37,361 --> 02:35:39,400
happened,
who was the guy who tackled me,

3445
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:41,020
uh,
that had hit me.

3446
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:43,270
And then somebody,
nobody hits you.

3447
02:35:43,271 --> 02:35:45,580
You just dropped by herself.
And then I had done,

3448
02:35:45,790 --> 02:35:47,830
you know,
I found out that that's what everybody

3449
02:35:47,831 --> 02:35:50,260
feels like an explosion.
It's an explosion.

3450
02:35:50,261 --> 02:35:53,650
But the way your body feels it,
it's as if there was an impact.

3451
02:35:53,660 --> 02:35:56,980
Someone just clobbered the back of my
leg.

3452
02:35:57,310 --> 02:35:58,150
Nobody was around.

3453
02:35:58,150 --> 02:35:59,950
I just dropped.
That totally makes sense.

3454
02:35:59,951 --> 02:36:02,320
It's amazing how fragile we are.
It's incredible.

3455
02:36:02,350 --> 02:36:04,810
People are so,
it was like the human body that's

3456
02:36:04,811 --> 02:36:06,130
similar.
That's one of them.

3457
02:36:06,580 --> 02:36:08,260
That's a,
that's a standing board.

3458
02:36:08,261 --> 02:36:13,060
This one is a surface is a surface you
stand on and it's just an uneven surface

3459
02:36:13,061 --> 02:36:15,340
that has many different layers to it and
many different,

3460
02:36:15,341 --> 02:36:19,990
um,
so now it's Sunday at either whatever,

3461
02:36:20,260 --> 02:36:22,120
there's a bunch of them I'm sure.
But you know,

3462
02:36:22,121 --> 02:36:25,270
there's all these different solutions
that people try to come up with for the

3463
02:36:25,271 --> 02:36:28,030
real problem,
which is not sitting in the proper

3464
02:36:28,031 --> 02:36:29,680
posture at a,
at a chair.

3465
02:36:29,710 --> 02:36:33,790
And I sit in this desk doing these
podcasts for like yesterday I did nine

3466
02:36:33,791 --> 02:36:34,720
hours.
Wow.

3467
02:36:34,750 --> 02:36:36,310
Yeah.
And when I'm doing that,

3468
02:36:36,311 --> 02:36:38,270
I'm just sitting like this and my back
doesn't hurt it.

3469
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:42,490
She didn't feel that your mental acuity
is as strong going into podcast number

3470
02:36:42,491 --> 02:36:47,440
three as it was in number one or yeah,
it's only nine hours.

3471
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:50,350
It's not that big a deal as long as
you're eating food.

3472
02:36:50,370 --> 02:36:52,450
And I asked this is because,
you know,

3473
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:56,260
earlier in my teaching career,
I could do back to back lectures,

3474
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:59,500
each one being three hours and it was no
problem.

3475
02:36:59,890 --> 02:37:02,830
Now I can't do it,
not because of mental acuity problems,

3476
02:37:03,130 --> 02:37:07,720
but because when I send me back back
starts hurting by about hour for,

3477
02:37:07,721 --> 02:37:09,410
I can't do it.
Well let's wrap this up and I'm gonna,

3478
02:37:09,430 --> 02:37:10,690
I'm gonna show you all this stuff,
equipment,

3479
02:37:10,691 --> 02:37:12,200
because you should really invest in this
stuff.

3480
02:37:12,270 --> 02:37:14,380
So it'll make a big difference in your,
your,

3481
02:37:14,381 --> 02:37:17,630
the health of your back.
Because it's one thing we really didn't,

3482
02:37:17,690 --> 02:37:20,030
they just don't,
they don't look into enough.

3483
02:37:20,060 --> 02:37:22,280
And the only time they look into it is
when they're already injured.

3484
02:37:22,330 --> 02:37:22,941
Right.
And,

3485
02:37:22,941 --> 02:37:25,490
uh,
I really wish people would pay way more

3486
02:37:25,491 --> 02:37:28,370
attention.
And I wish I had known this before I got

3487
02:37:28,371 --> 02:37:29,204
injured.

3488
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:32,750
I got injured from martial arts because
just the nature of Jujitsu and

3489
02:37:32,751 --> 02:37:34,910
wrestling.
There's a lot of people that I get in.

3490
02:37:34,911 --> 02:37:38,660
I know a lot of guys that have had disc
replacements and all sorts of fusions

3491
02:37:38,661 --> 02:37:41,040
and stuff and it's just the brutal
nature of,

3492
02:37:41,041 --> 02:37:42,560
of the sport.
But,

3493
02:37:42,590 --> 02:37:43,670
um,
the,

3494
02:37:43,671 --> 02:37:47,570
I think some of that at least can be
prevented with proper maintenance and

3495
02:37:47,571 --> 02:37:49,520
proper spine health.
Okay.

3496
02:37:49,550 --> 02:37:52,030
Decompression stretching.
I look forward to do yoga at all.

3497
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:53,690
I don't,
you should do it.

3498
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:54,261
I,
you know,

3499
02:37:54,261 --> 02:37:57,290
I do stretching,
but I do it in exactly the way that you

3500
02:37:57,291 --> 02:38:00,980
said I shouldn't,
which is very sporadic and yeah,

3501
02:38:01,010 --> 02:38:02,590
don't do that.
He got,

3502
02:38:02,620 --> 02:38:04,370
it's kind of a daily thing,
man.

3503
02:38:04,371 --> 02:38:06,320
It's gotta be one of those things like
brushing your teeth,

3504
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:07,670
right?
You write down,

3505
02:38:07,820 --> 02:38:09,770
you do it,
you get it out of the way.

3506
02:38:09,800 --> 02:38:11,660
Just force yourself.
To me,

3507
02:38:11,661 --> 02:38:15,710
there's certain things that I just can't
go through a week without doing,

3508
02:38:16,010 --> 02:38:18,680
you know?
And I don't allow myself because I know

3509
02:38:18,681 --> 02:38:22,130
that there's just,
it's easy to just fuck off and not do it

3510
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:23,870
right.
It's easy to just be lazy,

3511
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:25,700
but when you do that,
you,

3512
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:29,590
you do your body a disservice.
You quick final anecdote before we end,

3513
02:38:29,591 --> 02:38:33,260
I know we have to end just to point to
your incredible reach.

3514
02:38:33,560 --> 02:38:34,341
So I'm,
you know,

3515
02:38:34,341 --> 02:38:36,350
I'm recognized on the street reasonably
off.

3516
02:38:36,351 --> 02:38:37,430
We usually,
it's because of the visual.

3517
02:38:37,431 --> 02:38:38,740
Beautiful.
Beautiful,

3518
02:38:38,760 --> 02:38:40,550
right?
This is what happened about two weeks

3519
02:38:40,551 --> 02:38:42,410
ago.
I think I might've even tattooed you on

3520
02:38:42,470 --> 02:38:43,910
twitter about it,
but you're probably going to read it.

3521
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:48,210
I'm being served by a waiter slash bus
boy at a place in,

3522
02:38:49,080 --> 02:38:50,450
uh,
Venice beach.

3523
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:52,850
And the gentleman comes up to me and
says,

3524
02:38:52,910 --> 02:38:54,730
excuse me,
are you?

3525
02:38:56,420 --> 02:38:57,350
I said,
yes.

3526
02:38:57,710 --> 02:38:58,401
He goes,
Oh,

3527
02:38:58,401 --> 02:39:03,401
I recognized you by your voice because I
listened to Joe Rogan's podcast.

3528
02:39:05,320 --> 02:39:09,320
So this is the first time that I was
recognized auditorily,

3529
02:39:09,380 --> 02:39:11,990
not visually.
That's a pretty astute listener.

3530
02:39:12,110 --> 02:39:15,050
That's a guy who really listens to Joe
Rogan.

3531
02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:15,790
But I mean,
I,

3532
02:39:15,790 --> 02:39:20,790
I say that story simply to point to
apparently how infinite you'll reaches.

3533
02:39:21,020 --> 02:39:23,480
That's pretty crazy.
Or I have a very unique,

3534
02:39:23,570 --> 02:39:25,370
very sexy,
and they definitely have that.

3535
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:27,350
You definitely have that.
But I also think that guy is probably

3536
02:39:27,351 --> 02:39:30,020
pretty exceptional in his ability to
pick up voice has amazing.

3537
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:31,490
Yeah.
Because your voice is,

3538
02:39:31,550 --> 02:39:32,330
it's,
uh,

3539
02:39:32,330 --> 02:39:35,330
it's distinctive,
but not so much.

3540
02:39:35,331 --> 02:39:35,901
Right.
Exactly.

3541
02:39:35,901 --> 02:39:36,734
Yeah.
Well,

3542
02:39:36,890 --> 02:39:37,490
listen,
man,

3543
02:39:37,490 --> 02:39:39,980
it's always a pleasure having you and
somewhat have an open invitation.

3544
02:39:39,981 --> 02:39:41,360
Of course.
Anytime you're in town,

3545
02:39:41,361 --> 02:39:43,310
and I really do hope you wind up moving
here.

3546
02:39:43,370 --> 02:39:45,020
Thank you buddy.
Fuck those winters up there,

3547
02:39:45,021 --> 02:39:45,801
buddy.
Love you,

3548
02:39:45,801 --> 02:39:46,640
man.
I love you too,

3549
02:39:46,641 --> 02:39:47,474
brother.
Thank you.

3550
02:39:47,660 --> 02:39:50,300
All right folks.
We'll be back at five o'clock and about

3551
02:39:50,301 --> 02:39:52,570
40 minutes with Josh apps.
See?

3552
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:53,473
Yeah,

3553
02:39:59,250 --> 02:39:59,340
yeah.
