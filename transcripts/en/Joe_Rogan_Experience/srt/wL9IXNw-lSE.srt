1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,321
I try,
I,

2
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:03,270
I'll,
I won't take them unless I can actually

3
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:06,000
sell it,
but having to sell it more than once,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,660
which doesn't happen.
Which you have squarespace now.

5
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,830
I think we're live right?
We're live.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,590
All right.
I like that one because it's real,

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,450
like there's no disputing.
It's a really good product like.

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,530
Yeah,
but Charlie does my website and uses

9
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:23,130
squarespace so he can actually tell the
shit that it does.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,260
Well,
red bands made like no bullshit,

11
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:30,261
like a dozen or more websites during the
time in which it took to do a

12
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:33,060
squarespace commercial.
He would just slap together a bunch of

13
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,880
pictures,
call it red blood easy and put it up

14
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,460
online in like 30 seconds and I'm not
bullshitting.

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,290
It's that easy.
But yeah,

16
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,500
we made.
What was the one that he made some gay

17
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,450
one with Ari.
Do you remember?

18
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:48,450
Jamie burt?
Squirts was one of them,

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,790
but there was something about Ari's legs
or something,

20
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:54,120
something sexually feet on the table or
some shit like that.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,960
Yeah,
something like that.

22
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:55,910
Right.
Okay.

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,740
So it's probably not,
it doesn't exist anymore.

24
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,660
Maybe some fan picked it up in Omaha,
but um,

25
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,070
it's,
it's a legit sponsor,

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,330
right?
You can't argue with it.

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,810
Some of them to get sketchy.
There's a couple light turn down some

28
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:16,890
luxurious sheets and I have no idea what
it was,

29
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:20,610
but I do buy nice sheets because I sleep
a lot.

30
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,890
So they go,
they're going to send you a free set of

31
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,891
these luxurious sheets and these are
$300 sheets that are shittier than the

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,950
$59 ones I bought from some triple a
promotion on a email spam blast.

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,310
I'm not promoting that.
Money's not that good.

34
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,910
But we had this one called lumosity.
Have you heard of that one?

35
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,420
And it's like brain games and they're
actually kind of cool.

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,190
They're fun to play,
they're stimulating,

37
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,580
but I'm like,
games are good for you.

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,740
Like if you play chess,
chess is good for the brain.

39
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,780
It's good for the brand.
Try to solve puzzles,

40
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,550
try to.
It's like an exercise.

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,630
So that's undeniable.
But I guess someone had fucked up and

42
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:04,560
like made some outlandish claims.
Like it helps early onset Alzheimer's

43
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:07,410
disease and memory loss.
And a lot of like,

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,570
I don't know who said what,
I don't know what happened,

45
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,450
but they lost millions of dollars in
court so they must have said some stupid

46
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:15,510
shit.
They were one of our sponsors and while

47
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,870
we were doing it,
people will like one of my sponsors and

48
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,440
that really went sideways.
You got in late,

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,990
you're late adapter.
Yeah.

50
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,280
There were just.
It's not a bad product.

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,310
It's good.
They're fun.

52
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,200
It's fun to play.
They're stimulating little games,

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,630
but I guess they don't know.
Make you smarter or fix your problem is

54
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:40,020
I would promote shit.
This is not my sponsor just because I

55
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:44,400
liked it because I had to go to break.
So just make up a fucking neck stuff you

56
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:48,480
like or stuff I didn't even.
I would just pick random things out of.

57
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,940
All right.
Let's say a Bangor Maine,

58
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,310
a wedding attire and this google
someone's shop and then do a whole like

59
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:58,470
really dumb.
Hey,

60
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,790
you're getting married on Tuesday.

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,070
Wow.
Where is your wife going to get a

62
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:07,600
wedding dress on short notice.
Just and do the actual company without

63
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,920
their knowledge or consent.
And just do a really bad commercial just

64
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:13,720
for fun.
That's a good move.

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,580
That's a real good move.
Yeah.

66
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:20,581
But things that I actually liked,
I've bet on a bed online dot age.

67
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,530
That's where I do my sports betting and
then we.

68
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,870
But I promote them all the time,
like how am I going to get a deal of

69
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,990
them promote free.
Anyway,

70
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,020
I keep telling you that what'll happen
is that's Brian Hennigan,

71
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:36,700
my filthy uncut,
scotsmen manager sitting in who tells me

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,360
don't say anything for free.
Brian.

73
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,160
That's a good.
That's always a good move.

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,050
Don't say nothing for free,
Dude.

75
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,470
You're a.
you're off often on his podcast.

76
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,480
Very enjoyable.
Well listen you guys together.

77
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,330
Oh,
podcasts.

78
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:50,980
Pretty bad ass.

79
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,570
I enjoy it.
It's so loose.

80
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,750
So one of my favorite because it like,
it has no beginning.

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,720
It's just the conversations in mid
stride.

82
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,160
When is it on?
I don't know if it's fucking on this.

83
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,330
Things moving.
Okay.

84
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,260
It's my open mic.
I don't have comedy there.

85
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,440
So I do a podcast as open mic.
Just to keep in the mode of talking in

86
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:15,820
an entertainment arena.
And you cross training?

87
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,390
Yes,
basically it is,

88
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,480
right?
I mean it kind of in a way a defacto

89
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,590
open mic where otherwise I'd just be
watching fucking Netflix all the time so

90
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:30,940
I have to at least do something
artistically creatively.

91
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,700
Fuck.
We haven't put out a podcast.

92
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:38,080
We need to a week we try to hit.
How many people do we have?

93
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,180
Just over 5,000.
Do you guys,

94
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,230
do you think that it's possible that you
could sustain a small comedy club,

95
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,700
a small local comedy club?

96
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,190
Like we were kind of talking about this
the other night at the comedy store.

97
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,350
Like I think if you put together like a
small comedy clubs like you know,

98
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,740
150 seats or so like you could fill that
even though it's a weird place,

99
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,710
it's in the middle of nowhere.
You could make it like a destination

100
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:04,090
thing.
Like guys like me would do it.

101
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,550
I would do it for sure.
Problem is the.

102
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,420
And I make jokes about it,
but the main source of income and

103
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,460
[inaudible] his permanent disability or
handyman really.

104
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,040
So no one charges when I just,
I,

105
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,050
I've filmed as my last special there and
the fact that I was charging money at

106
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,830
all was reprehensible to a lot of the,
the town really.

107
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,830
Fortunately it sold out with out of
towners within under an hour.

108
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,250
Probably a better move that way,
right?

109
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,540
Yeah.
A lot of people in a small town,

110
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,680
they like.

111
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,360
I'm a rich guy there and again,
it's a destination at the weekend,

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,740
meaning it's the same as every comedy
club on the planet.

113
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,060
It only makes money at the weekends.
It could.

114
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,280
And it could do.
You could do that because you're only

115
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,500
like how far from Tucson?
An hour and a half.

116
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,980
Yeah.
See,

117
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,400
that's not much actual Tucson,
but that's driving.

118
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,490
That's a fun track.
Like that'd be a fun track.

119
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,720
You know,
you fly into Tucson,

120
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,640
fuck yeah.
We're going to go to the fucking standup

121
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:07,400
comedy club and then you take a drive,
you rent a car.

122
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,410
Uber if you're baller,
these stay at this shady Dell Dot com

123
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,640
place.
But know that that's a friend of mine,

124
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,600
that vintage trailer park.
It's.

125
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,300
I look for reasons to stay there.
Hey,

126
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,540
let's fumigate the house so we have a
reason to stay at the Shady Dell.

127
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,150
Nineteen fifties airstream trailers,
the silver gun,

128
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,460
everything inside old records with old
record players,

129
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,130
silverware and cups or wow,
19 Tiki bus.

130
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,980
Wow.
You could just go back and dig and

131
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,010
roleplay and got married there on a.
They have a 38 foot yacht that you can

132
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,710
stay on.
Just land locked and unlocked.

133
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,720
Dry,
dry.

134
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,080
Dr. Look how well that marriage went.
Hey,

135
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,340
Hey,
citizen,

136
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,550
I don't want to insinuate to any crime
took place on this podcast.

137
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,880
Let's change the subject rapidly.
That's fucking.

138
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,290
How ridiculous is that that all you have
to do to become a citizen is you got to

139
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,950
get a person in that country to sign
some paper saying you guys are together

140
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,550
like you.
We'll let you.

141
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,610
We'll let you in.
Would you gotta you gotta be in love.

142
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,810
I don't know.
This is real.

143
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,400
The fact that they'll fucking
investigate like I don't believe it.

144
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,490
I would gay marry someone to get them in
the country just for the 10 minutes of

145
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:26,790
material.
We were going to gain,

146
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:31,670
marry each other on the last episode of
the just to save each other's money

147
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,490
before it was officially canceled.

148
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,480
I remember I was in the Atlanta
punchline parking lot drunk and I called

149
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,650
Zoe Friedman.
I go,

150
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,600
I know this show is going to get
canceled,

151
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:45,170
but please.
It was just when Massachusetts legalized

152
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:47,230
gay marriage was New Hampshire was.
It was,

153
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,020
it was new.
It was big news and I go and we just met

154
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,520
her last episode,
be me and Joe getting gay married and

155
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:58,940
then show how perfect a marriage that
would be.

156
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,050
We don't fight over the remote control.
You want to go bowling?

157
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:05,000
I want to go fishing.
There's no problem.

158
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,101
Yeah,
we,

159
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:11,101
we explain how awesome the gay lifestyle
really would be other than the gay

160
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,280
parts.
Yeah.

161
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,190
Other than all the bud fucking Dick
Soccer

162
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,970
seems like a great time.
What do you do that before you get

163
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:22,370
married?
Just get it out of the way.

164
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,830
Every fucking Sitcom with a married
Hetero couple is uh,

165
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,400
uh.

166
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,990
Well,
you want to fuck.

167
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,860
Oh fuck.
Well,

168
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,350
what's fascinating to me is the
reinvigoration of manhood that I

169
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,630
witnessed and men that are in their
forties,

170
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:43,631
they get divorced like p segway talking
to live again,

171
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,550
you know,
don't you notice that the saddest part

172
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:54,551
is it's men or women,
but I noticed the women who just,

173
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,880
they kids when they were 18 and they
married some fucking dentist and now

174
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:04,320
they're pushing 40 and the kids in
college and they get divorced and

175
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:08,190
they're going to go out on the town and
we're going to have fun tonight and they

176
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:12,270
just stand out like they're trying to
dance when no one else is dancing on the

177
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:13,990
dance floor.
And yeah,

178
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,970
it's sad.
It's odd.

179
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,420
We go right back to,
you know,

180
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,740
when they graduated college,
but now they're 41.

181
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,890
But isn't it?
It's fascinating because like as a human

182
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:26,341
being,
right,

183
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:27,960
you're supposed to be like living in the
moment.

184
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,840
You're supposed to be enjoying the
moment like you are alive.

185
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,340
Is it just the inevitable doom of the
clock ticking in the background that

186
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,370
makes it so sad?
Is that what it is every morning?

187
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:42,930
For me,
I do not wake up on a morning without

188
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,940
thinking about how much time do I have
left,

189
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,600
when will I die,
stinks the great demise.

190
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,600
But I've been doing that since my early
mid thirties.

191
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,660
So.
Wow.

192
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,690
Well,
if you think about it,

193
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,720
it becomes inevitable.
I mean everyone bashing your lifestyle

194
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,470
because there wasn't an error.
The Sam Kinison era,

195
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,030
probably bad example.
Well he died in a drunk driving

196
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,270
accident.
He wasn't even drunk.

197
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,430
Yeah,
he was sober.

198
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:15,480
But where that was acceptable and then
it became unacceptable.

199
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,810
So I'm,
you know,

200
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,070
I can name me and Ron White as the two
comics have any tenure that still

201
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:27,570
actually drink heavily and smokes
cigarettes.

202
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,010
He smoked cigars,
whatever.

203
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,670
Dumb or rarely drinks pretty heavily.
Does he?

204
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,300
Yeah,
he's pretty open about it.

205
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,580
He drinks pretty much every night,
right?

206
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

207
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:39,900
We heard he's not known for it.
Like he doesn't,

208
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:44,220
he doesn't bring it up a lot.
He doesn't walk out onstage at three

209
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:46,430
drinks under his arm,
like Neil Hamburger.

210
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,840
Right.
But for real now he'll go up there with

211
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,080
a drink or so.
But he's such a great guy.

212
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,380
I just saw them last week or the salt of
the Earth Chi,

213
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,790
that expression.
He said no more true than that guy.

214
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,880
He's just so sweet.
He's such a lovable guy.

215
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,750
Anyway,
I see him.

216
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:05,000
I just can't wait to hug them.
You know,

217
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,910
we're on a cruise ship and I was just a
passenger.

218
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,110
It was the impractical jokers,
which I fucking love their shows so

219
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:16,590
much.
They put on a fan crews and I've founded

220
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,740
and I go bingo.
And I.

221
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,540
Who is impractical jokers?
Jokers.

222
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,800
Yeah,
it was two weeks ago.

223
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,350
Who are they?
It's untrue TV.

224
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,420
Uh,
one of the worst networks out there.

225
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,400
Oh,
that's for guys.

226
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,170
They're all friends and they do pranks
like you would do with your buddies.

227
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:37,100
It's not like fucking Ashton Kutcher on
punked.

228
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,700
They just dare each other to do shots
fired

229
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,450
is when you explained it doesn't,
it doesn't.

230
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,760
I'm the first to say Ashton Kutcher,
the guy you haven't heard about an eight

231
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:52,530
years is a Douche.
But when you explain the explaining the

232
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,160
Tru TV print,
practical jokers

233
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,470
is kind of.
It doesn't sound that funny.

234
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,840
But when you see it is fantastic.
Genuine,

235
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:00,040
and that's what I would say.
For the record,

236
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,110
I met Ashton Kutcher.
It was very nice,

237
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,380
but does show sucked and I love his
camera.

238
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,040
He was a very nice guy.
I worked with them on that CVS hidden

239
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,750
camera thing.
I mean I only got to talk to him once,

240
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:15,550
but he was very friendly.
This is totally a valet driver is if

241
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,770
he's.
He's a fake al.

242
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,650
What idiot would just hand their keys to
anybody.

243
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,100
Well,
anyone who goes to a valet just as

244
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,800
smarmy tone though,
she's a douche.

245
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,510
Anyway,
he,

246
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:31,720
uh,
almond med almost got in a fistfight

247
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,880
with um,
travis barker.

248
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,420
Appears a mad.
I'm mad they were doing this prank on

249
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:42,421
punked or a met med was telling me the
stories he got to get like in travis

250
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:46,630
barker's face who's travis barker from
blink one,

251
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:46,870
eight two.

252
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,600
The drummer covered in tattoos,
right?

253
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,660
He's from blink one eight.
Two,

254
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,880
right.
Really nice guy.

255
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,510
Really cool guy,
amazing drummer and just an interesting

256
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:56,800
cat all around.
But he,

257
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,170
I guess he just doesn't take any shit
from people.

258
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,210
And ahmed ahmed like is a big guy,
like amount of meds.

259
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,980
You know,
200 plus pounds,

260
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,660
probably six foot one or something like
that.

261
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,840
He's a pretty big guy and except for the
intimidating part,

262
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,980
he's not intimidating.
No scared of.

263
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,040
I'm at a mad.
If you didn't know him,

264
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,750
he didn't have a suicide vest on
me.

265
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,630
I'd be the first to say,
how dare you.

266
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,520
How dare you.
I stole that from you,

267
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,260
but my
regular nomenclatures.

268
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,230
How dare you.
So joe rogan.

269
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,970
It's not even mine.
I mean that's just,

270
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,460
it's out there.
I don't knoW.

271
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,640
Hello.
Nice lady.

272
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:43,600
Hi.
Nice lady.

273
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:46,390
I know I stole that from a brendan
walsh.

274
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,410
Oh,
hi ladies.

275
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,570
nice lady.
I use that all the time.

276
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,490
Hey,
nice ladies.

277
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,790
A good one that's so fucking pejorative
but not.

278
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,210
It's like you don't remember name in it.
Instead of saying,

279
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,440
hey baby,
hey,

280
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,210
good.
Nice lady.

281
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,400
In a way with a nice lady.
I actually asked them once they go,

282
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,750
did I steal that from you?
You don't know.

283
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,190
That's a good one is brendan's walsh
always said it,

284
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,200
but I'm assuming he said just meet a
funny guy that like fuck it works in the

285
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:21,070
kitchen and he has great lines.
You forget where you got them from and

286
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:22,780
then all of a sudden you're like,
you're all going,

287
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:24,100
hey now or you know,
hey,

288
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:27,220
there are whatever this means that I use
all the time.

289
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,680
And I stole that from captain rowdy's
wife,

290
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,130
ms dot kimmy is a comic gold comic
captain rowdy.

291
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,020
And she answered the phone.

292
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,330
It'd be for rowdy and she'd go,
please hold.

293
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,330
I fucking use that ever since.
That's hilarious.

294
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,250
Please hold.
Eddie bravo had a,

295
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,140
these prescription pharmaceutical
companies calling him up.

296
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,370
Apparently he had used his money or uses
number other to uh,

297
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,420
like on a credit card order and bought
some pharmaceutical drugs.

298
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,510
So they would just randomly call him.
I,

299
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,090
they gave out his number so he would
just be fucking sit around and they

300
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,810
would call him and ask him if he wants
to buy various drugs.

301
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,310
They sound different.
Canada.

302
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:11,220
This was back when they could do that.
So any baba would put phone down.

303
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,230
Who would walk away for five minutes?
I'll be right back.

304
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:18,680
I just got to find my.
I know I got my money here.

305
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:19,820
So harlow's saying,
well yeah,

306
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:22,550
I'm definitely buying some stuff and he
put the phone down the street that's

307
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:26,900
called a stroker.
I'm from the old telemarketing days.

308
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,610
Oh,
that's a stroke or someone who would

309
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:32,690
just purposely keep you on the phone and
fuck with you for as long as they could,

310
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,190
which is actually a good move while we
were fucking defrauding people.

311
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,560
So you can't hold it against him.
No,

312
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,450
it's fun if you get it.
That's a smart one.

313
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:43,490
You got a smart one.
You got one that Didn't fall into the

314
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:46,370
hive.
I hate bounty hunters just because their

315
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,413
cocks.

316
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,950
I meAn you have a point,
a stroke or as a point.

317
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,830
Yeah,
stroke or as a point for sure.

318
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,250
Random phone calls like especially the
unsolicited phone calls.

319
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,480
Fuck them.
So all just get the fucking robots now

320
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,210
and what I get now,
I don't know if anyone else gets this.

321
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,630
They mimic your own phone number,
so it will have my same area,

322
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:15,380
code and prefix,
and then just screw up the last four

323
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:18,170
numbers a little bit.
So you,

324
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,910
I Assume the psychology is,
you recognize that phone number and then

325
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:24,320
answer it and then you go,
oh fuck,

326
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:27,350
that's my phone number.
And now you're listening to a bot call.

327
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,940
Do you want to extend your warranty?
You have a liMited time.

328
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,900
How many people actually buy into those?
I mean,

329
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,460
it has to be worthwhile.
Otherwise they wouldn't just keep doing

330
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,303
it.
I said,

331
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,530
well,
it's a robot.

332
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,880
it's a fucking computer.
So if you could just hit a program and

333
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:47,510
then go off to whatever you do,
selling shoes.

334
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,180
Some people are just really fucking
lonely too.

335
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:52,190
That's one thing to take into
consideration.

336
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,830
My grandfather,
before he died,

337
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,980
my grandmother died and then my,
it was one of those classic stories

338
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,530
where my grandmother dies and then my
grandfather dies a year later,

339
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,250
just just didn't want to live.
But in that year that you didn't visit,

340
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:06,920
he got lonely and I would take all
around here,

341
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:09,080
man in that,
uh,

342
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,570
in That year,
um,

343
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:15,850
he got addicted to buying things from
catalogs like you'd like he was,

344
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,950
he was,
he was getting cancer and was he in his

345
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:22,780
forties to know,
I mean just like was buying things that

346
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,960
they would call him up and they would
like offer him like catalogs and stuff

347
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:27,760
like that.
And he would,

348
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,020
you know,
who get the catalogs,

349
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,000
he would order things from the catalogs
and it became like a problem.

350
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:35,480
Like you,
he just would get it just like his wife

351
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:37,910
was gone and who know,
his wife was there his whole life.

352
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,040
So it's like you don't have anybody to
talk to.

353
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,340
I think part of you just goes insane.
Like part of you Blows a fuse,

354
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:49,440
like the normal inputs just not there.
Like usually it's you and the wife

355
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,150
and the husband,
you and the,

356
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,220
you know,
and then it's gone and they're like,

357
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,020
where's that thing that's part of my
life?

358
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,450
It's like a part of you dies,
you know?

359
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,300
And that they really do just want to die
and that's how they go.

360
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,080
How do you correlAte that to shopping?
This is my beef with fucking hoarders is

361
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,840
hoarders.
We'll do a montage like intervention

362
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:11,880
does.
Well.

363
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,230
Then her husband left for another woman
and then she started

364
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,910
stockIng the basement full of dollar
stores.

365
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:22,980
Shit.
I don't know that.

366
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,800
That,
that the cause and effect.

367
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,890
There's no scientific.
Your psych intervention,

368
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,410
hey,
tell me one bad thing that ever happened

369
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,570
to you and we'll do a montage about
that.

370
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,650
And that's why you're a fucking crack
addict is though.

371
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,170
No scientific proof.
That's why you're a crack addict.

372
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,100
That they try to pin it on something.
There's plenty of people who had great

373
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,380
childhoods that are fucking crack
addicts,

374
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,770
but they need to have some reason this a
chicks would fucking self help books all

375
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,090
over their shelf.

376
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,620
Why thing?
It's not an either or thing.

377
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:58,800
I think that's part of it.
Like there's a lot of people that have

378
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,440
drug addictions because of abuse,
right?

379
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,240
We,
I think we all know them because a lot

380
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:06,510
of people that get involved in drug
addiction because they were abused as a

381
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:11,511
child and whatever fuse blew.
They're like constantly trying to put

382
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:12,690
out that fire.
Right.

383
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,930
There's that.
But then there's also people that they

384
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:18,900
just fucking can't do it.
They just can't drink or they can't.

385
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,610
They can't do drugs.
They just can't.

386
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,870
They do it and then they get sharp eyes
and they're fucking gone.

387
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,850
They're just off to the races and we've
all.

388
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,750
We've all met people.

389
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,910
I know sean rouse is what you're saying,
but i'M saying it.

390
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,520
Bravo,
bravo is figured out how to pull in

391
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,980
though.
My point is your grandpa just like the

392
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,580
shit out of catalogs because he's bored.
I'm going to die soon.

393
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,480
let me just buy some shit and jack up a
credit card because I'm not going to be

394
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:49,000
around and pay this bill.
Once the family investigated,

395
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,280
that wasn't the case,
but I can understand why you would think

396
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:55,780
that for your grandpa specifically,
but he was.

397
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,910
People correlate.
Yeah.

398
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:00,460
He was so old country though.
He was born in Italy.

399
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,720
He was as old countries,
you get grew up on a farm,

400
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,760
taught me how to break a rabbit's neck.
I kill a rabbit.

401
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:09,930
When I grew up in a place,
there were no catalogs

402
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,490
die.
I better take advantage of all these new

403
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:17,410
fangled way like magic.

404
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,290
There was always the big thing That my
grandfather worked in a factory that

405
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,530
made a part for the atomic bomb.
Wow.

406
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,970
It was like one of those things that
you,

407
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,860
the whole family would talk about.
You know,

408
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:32,340
grandpa worked in a factory that made a
part for them

409
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,070
bomb wah,
wah wah.

410
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,890
It was like,
you know,

411
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,780
like sort of a badge of pride and some
sort of weird fucking way.

412
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,820
I think that's why he drank because he
knew he killed all those people in nigga

413
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,180
sakhi you didn't even.
Oh,

414
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,240
a guy with no conscience.
He was in.

415
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,120
He was a great guy.
My grandfather was the one of the nicest

416
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,250
guys of all time.
He was like,

417
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,770
even for Back then,
it's a hard time,

418
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,770
you know,
he was not a hard man at all.

419
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,220
He was the nicest guy.
When someone dies,

420
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,640
people say,
and he was such a sweet man and a nice

421
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:12,940
man and my dad,
even to this day when I was writing this

422
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,370
book above my mother,
oh,

423
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:17,820
your father was the sweetest person
ever.

424
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,430
He really was.
And I couldn't even say that about my

425
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:24,070
mother.
She was a real cunt towards the end.

426
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,500
She was a fucking bitter,
spiteful,

427
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,850
needy at the end.
At the beginning was just someone who

428
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:33,370
had a kid too young.
I met her like three quarters in and she

429
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:36,910
was great.
She was on the show.

430
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,930
He went back and in that book,
because my memory's shit and I watched

431
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,230
the episode with my mom and your mom
somewhere out there on some ceo or some

432
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:47,734
shit.
Right,

433
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,870
right.
I forgot about that.

434
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:50,704
Yeah.
Uh,

435
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:56,080
and like there's a lot of things in the
book that sounded like bullshit and I

436
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,580
know just sound like I got laid for the
first time when I was nine years old

437
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:04,180
before you could come.
And that sounds like that's on that

438
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:09,080
episode where the site was me and you
and they,

439
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:10,240
uh,
we had cards.

440
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,380
Okay.
Which one of us,

441
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:16,381
we had embarrassing things from our
childhood and our mothers were on like

442
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,280
jeopardy style and a.

443
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,660
Okay.
Which one of us did this and mine was

444
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,880
who lost his virginity in third grade in
a church and bang,

445
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,890
my mom's slaps the button.
That's my boy.

446
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,350
That was the name of the game.
That's my boy.

447
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,670
And she.
I'm like,

448
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,220
you're verifying everything in this
book.

449
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:40,000
That sounds like bullshit on tape.
Thank you.

450
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,830
[inaudible].
Lot of stuff.

451
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,030
Do you ever have stories that you.
You will only tell if there's someone in

452
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,120
the room to verify because otherwise you
sound like a liar.

453
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,380
Yeah,
it sounds crazy.

454
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,980
Yeah.
She verified five different stories that

455
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:55,120
are in the book.
Well,

456
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:57,130
you remember when we had your mom review
porn?

457
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,020
Yeah,
she was fucking great at it.

458
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,960
She was great.
She would watch these dvds and review

459
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:03,340
them.
It was really funny.

460
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,990
It was humorous.
IT was.

461
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,260
It was really funny.
She was good.

462
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,161
She was good.
So I,

463
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:13,600
I saw her at her best.
That's when I knew your mats once she

464
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,120
started drinking again was right after
the man show.

465
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,200
Oh no,
really?

466
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,710
She had been like 22 years sober.
She was sneaking it.

467
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:23,790
She'd be drinking cough syrup because
she,

468
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,460
she's a lifelong menthol smoker,
so she always had a cough.

469
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:29,650
So anytime you went to that filthy
apartment,

470
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,640
she had a little shot glass of cough
syrup.

471
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,830
So she was kinda like weaning or way
back into drinking,

472
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:43,690
but using the
fucking dollar store robitussin.

473
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:46,370
I remember talking about it on my first
cd,

474
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,410
year 2001 probably when.

475
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,640
Yeah,
I think back then you could get the real

476
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,860
shit.
I had a.

477
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,400
I wouldn't get real shit.
She was a dollar store for you,

478
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,200
nicole.
Like nicole would fuck you up.

479
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:04,590
Back then.
There was a comic that used to get one

480
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:08,670
of the guys who worked at a rascals in
west orange.

481
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,410
There was a comic he used to get.
One of the guys worked there to go buy

482
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:18,411
him bottles of nyquil.
He would just drink bottles of fucking

483
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:19,830
my,
uh,

484
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,110
when my brother was in the marine corps
in okinawa,

485
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:25,770
there was a whole bunch of them.
They called themselves the robo raiders

486
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,010
because they would drink robot testing
until they hallucinate.

487
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,600
Fucking listen to this.
oh,

488
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,110
the regular nyquil I think had coding
and it didn't have jamie,

489
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,600
you could get so fucked up like an
amazing way.

490
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,003
I,
uh,

491
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,220
I got to do it.
That's why I've had to morphine

492
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,960
experiences.
One of them was in the hospital after I

493
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,910
had knee surgery.
They gave me this thing that you could

494
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,580
press and you can press it.
Every time you press it you get more and

495
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:02,780
more.
And I was like,

496
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,630
oh,
well let's being high score.

497
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,370
I'm like,
I am in agony.

498
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:09,750
They just,
they drilled some shit into my knee,

499
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,390
replaced a ligament and cut one and took
out bone and screwed it together.

500
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,420
It's fucking agony.
So I'm just like,

501
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:18,300
oh pam,
pam,

502
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:20,840
pam,
and it just took me to this amazing

503
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:21,980
place of bliss.
And I'm like,

504
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,710
well,
no wonder why that shit's hard to get.

505
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,470
No wonder why it's illegal.
And then the next time I never would

506
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:32,471
take medicine,
but I got a bad cold and I just needed

507
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:35,480
to sleep and I couldn't sleep.
So I took some nyquil and it was

508
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:38,240
amazing.
It was the same feeling that I had when

509
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:41,420
I had surgery.
It's like the nyquil just took me to

510
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:46,421
this butte,
fell back into the most amazing down

511
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,310
pillow.
Just have love to

512
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,860
people that are a beautiful jagged on
the vicodin percocet.

513
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,600
So an opiate where I've taken vicodin.
It did nothing.

514
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:06,601
Even when I had one surgery in my adult
life was an umbilical hernia and they

515
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,270
gave it to me as a painkiller and I
didn't feel any pain,

516
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:12,640
but I didn't feel any high.
And I'm like,

517
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:17,320
maybe this just doesn't hurt.
Why buddy that got into vicodin

518
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,490
for writing,
he would write on it.

519
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,120
He would take vicodin and write music.
That was his thing.

520
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:28,020
He loved to crush up vicodins and then
he would take it and I don't know how he

521
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,760
would do it,
snort it or whether you would just

522
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,430
swallow them,
but he would,

523
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:33,530
uh,
he would say that as music had become

524
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:34,364
very creative native

525
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,360
and it would do that.
I can't write on anything but a fear.

526
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,020
Seriously.
I write sober,

527
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,130
afraid I'll

528
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:49,110
write some shit down when I'm drunk
ideas and then sober me will have to go

529
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,470
back and clean them up.
Okay.

530
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,410
I got at best I can remember the premise
and now I have to make this good.

531
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,280
But uh,
there's,

532
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,830
there's drugs that are good for stage
cocaine,

533
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,890
which I'm not a regular user of,
but I've had shows where I'm just tired

534
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:11,520
of saying this shit and do a bump before
stage.

535
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,510
It's great for stage,
but for writing nothing other than see

536
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,930
fear and coffee.
Joey diaz says that coke was terrible

537
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:20,040
for him,
for the stage.

538
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,380
Joey said that coke would make them lock
up.

539
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,110
It would make them feel evil and make
them feel greedy.

540
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,600
He goes away.
Would would take out the love.

541
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,520
The amount of toke joey diaz was
probably doing is different than a small

542
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,940
bic cap
that I would do like a 48 hour energy

543
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:40,794
drink.

544
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,690
Do you remember that time?
We did a musHrooms the day of the war.

545
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,720
We took this as,
I've never had cocaine,

546
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:53,721
but I did have this fucking coca leaves
tea from [inaudible] and he had this

547
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,980
montay to cocoa tea was tea that was
made out of cocoa leaves and you would,

548
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:02,190
uh,
you would drink it and I just couldn't

549
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:06,360
shut the fuck up.
RememBer I was talking to you about,

550
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,360
you and I were having this conversation
about it.

551
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,040
I was like,
this is what coke is like,

552
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,080
oh my god,
this is awful.

553
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,180
We've always said you're terrified of
trying because if I like,

554
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:17,880
you know,
go fucking hay wire.

555
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:22,590
And I think I'm terrified of it because
when I grew up I saw two people that it

556
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:24,960
was pretty close to a completely ruined
their lives.

557
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,280
One was a really good friend and anoTher
one was a really good friend's cousin

558
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,980
and I watched their life just go to
shit.

559
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,330
I've seen the same thing.
I saw a couple of fat girls get thin.

560
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,140
Do you remember when they had phen phen?
Do you remember?

561
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:42,800
If I remember existing,
what is,

562
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:47,520
I knew a girl diet pill.
His fucking truck stops speed basically,

563
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:50,190
but sold under a different marketing
umbrella.

564
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,910
Well,
it was really fucking bad for you.

565
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,930
I knew a girl who was god on it and she
went from being unfortunately like

566
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,150
plump.
She was heR name,

567
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,690
ellen burstyn and requiem for a dream.
No,

568
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,740
no.
It's a different girl.

569
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,110
She was like a little plump.
Three people out there got that

570
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:10,980
reference.
Good.

571
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,980
But that was a good movie though.
Requiem for a dream was the shit.

572
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,660
I almost forgotten about that movie.
I said the fen phen lost a ton of

573
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:20,760
weight,
looked amazing,

574
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,460
but then started feeling really,
really bad.

575
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,710
Like you kNow,
you get like fucking heart issues,

576
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:26,490
man.
Me,

577
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,490
you were on essentially you're on speed
speed for a fuckinG year and after a

578
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:33,210
while your hearts like,
hey,

579
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:35,670
fuck.
Had some oil in.

580
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:39,150
This engine will Run at about 88,000
fucking rpm.

581
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,680
She looked amazing though,
man.

582
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,590
I mean she went from being a girl who
had this really pretty faCe.

583
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:50,380
It just couldn't get her body in order
for whatever reason,

584
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:53,770
her diet,
drinking and a lot of just a story.

585
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:58,771
This weekend on a newser is where I Go
for my read less no more or some dumb

586
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,130
shit.
Some girl in Wisconsin froze to death,

587
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:08,131
leaving a party in a tank top and shorts
at six below zero security cameras

588
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:14,020
caught her walking like a thousand feet
and then just curled up and fucking

589
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,390
died.
Oh my god.

590
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,120
That's the vanity.
Can't go.

591
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,900
Just underdressed to be sexy.
That's why it chick always wants your

592
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:23,980
coat.
When she goes,

593
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,370
I'm going to dress all sexy and then
it's 25 degrees out.

594
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:28,840
Can I wear your coat?
No.

595
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:32,920
I brought a coat because I know it's
fucking cold outside or how dare you.

596
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,450
First of all,
this girl was drunk.

597
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,960
So you gotta think this girl has
friends,

598
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,190
right?
How the fuck our friends?

599
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,050
Like listen,
if we're all hanging out.

600
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,970
Okay.
And it's fucking six below zero.

601
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,900
And I go,
where's doug?

602
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,570
Where the fuck is doug was doug.
Have you seen doug?

603
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,110
I'm thinking you blacked out when
wandering off into the fucking arctic.

604
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,720
I'm going to go outside looking for you.
I would immediately,

605
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,700
if we were all hammered,
if I knew we were fucked up,

606
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,600
so she's leaving a bar and she's fucked
up and her friends don't pay attention,

607
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,430
just curls up on the ground,
dies like there's more to her personal

608
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:06,550
story,
but I'm using that as an extreme example

609
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,090
of when you see chips waiting in line at
a bar like chill coot,

610
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:15,610
charlie's in Alaska and there's a line
around the block at midnight in the

611
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:19,300
winter and it's freezing,
but they're all dressed up horsley and

612
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:24,301
fish nets and whatever because they
don't say rather be in agony than look

613
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:25,684
bad.

614
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,400
There's so much power.
If you're a girl with a hot body and you

615
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:33,940
have fish nets on and you walk into a
bar and you have like black leather

616
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:37,900
shorts and fish nets and high heels and
you have a nice ass and great legs,

617
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,020
you are a queen.
I'm like,

618
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:42,580
you are god,
and you know what?

619
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:45,850
If you're a fat girl that can outlast
her,

620
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,430
you're going to get the same fucking
action.

621
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,690
So the same doug.
It is the lady.

622
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:55,180
It's the same,
the girl with the fucking,

623
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,450
she gets all the attention.
She might get on instagram and get

624
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:01,670
fucking millions of friends and
squarespace starts giving her money.

625
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:04,500
Millions of real honest friends like
salted.

626
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,410
The earth close to me,
but enough is it just fills the void.

627
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,640
Like it doesn't have to be that void.
The kardashians made it

628
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,280
started that fire and then she fucking
vanished before the bomb went off.

629
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,680
she got out and vanished.
She got out,

630
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,390
she got the game.
Well,

631
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:23,480
it's like,
oh yeah,

632
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,410
just like old comics.
They didn't get out of the game.

633
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,930
They got replaced.
Yeah,

634
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,090
but we got out of the game.
She didn't need the money.

635
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,010
Well,
she develops a bunch of business

636
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,170
ventures that are extremely successful.
Yeah.

637
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,860
Like she makes a fucking ungodly amount
of money and decided to like lay.

638
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,100
Well,
she

639
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,100
realized that the ego has a horriBle
byproduct.

640
00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:48,710
Yes.
Like that fame comes at a price and the

641
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:53,711
price became too much.
She didn't need to be seen with beaver

642
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:55,970
hanging out.
It's probably Brittany Spears,

643
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,470
but they're all the same.
I'll do that though,

644
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,060
and I was like,
there was a time where girls are just

645
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:04,061
showing their pussy was amazing times.
It was like right when social media

646
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,000
first started popping.
Those girls were fucking gangster about

647
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:08,601
it.
They just said,

648
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:11,360
listen,
I'm going to put a photographer in a

649
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:14,960
place where no fucking photographer
would ever be and I'm going to pretend

650
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,370
that that guy just accidentally took
pictures of my pussy because what the

651
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:22,730
fuck?
Let's a guy get on his knees looking up

652
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:24,560
your dress as you get out of the
bentley.

653
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,960
That shit doesn't happen.
It's not what happened.

654
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,570
They have people,
they have security teams that rival the

655
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:34,400
secret service to make sure that doesn't
happen.

656
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,600
yet it happened to you in the most
flattering way on the day.

657
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,420
You weren't having your period and you
shaved your bush.

658
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,870
How amazing.
the luck of that photographer,

659
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,270
they always shave their bush.
That's where porn.

660
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:52,240
One more just one.
If amy schumer shaved her posts,

661
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,050
had some kind of particular razzies
shot.

662
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,290
Upper gi,
becAuse this is my amy schumer thing.

663
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,470
I know you don't wAnt to get into the
stealing jokes thing because I don't

664
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:06,020
know,
I'm out in the business do good business

665
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:10,400
to be honest,
but when she stArted doing the,

666
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,810
I'm going to pose naked when what?
My three rolls of fat,

667
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:19,400
because that's what a woman really is in
hollywood won't touch a person like

668
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,770
that.
I have a fucking grotesquely hanging

669
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,490
ball sack.
How bad and I wouldn't say it's worse

670
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:31,240
than most.
Do you remember joey from?

671
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,850
I'm a huge shock.

672
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,920
I had that picture dick him ball sack.
If you have a huge dick to compensate

673
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:42,230
for the ball sack,
then it kind of looks all proportionate.

674
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,940
I have a small dick with hanging balls
are one hangs way lower than the other

675
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,270
and I would never like do some kind of a
annie liebowitz fucking photo spread

676
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,800
going,
you know what?

677
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:59,090
The porn industry doesn't accept people
like me,

678
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,600
but this is the reality of cock and
balls and I'm just going to show it.

679
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,820
You know what?
No one wants to fucking see it.

680
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,200
It bothers me that people who you just.
It's not hollywood that tells you what's

681
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:14,090
attractive,
but I.

682
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:16,910
I think she's funny.
I think amy schumer's funny.

683
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:21,650
I actually watched her comedy special
and laughed out loud alone on my lonely

684
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:24,290
couch,
but as laughing out loud.

685
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,900
She's verY funny.
She's funny on podcasts.

686
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,420
She's really funny on radio shows.
She's very quick.

687
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,070
I liked her a lot,
but it's not just people will go,

688
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,950
you have to accept my body style.
I didn't not accepted.

689
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,850
I just didn't buy a magazine to see it.
well I don't.

690
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,610
Do I get where they're coming from in a
way?

691
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,390
Yeah,
but I.

692
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:50,390
But they go like everything.
There's like low places that it goes

693
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:53,840
where I don't agree anymore and that's
one of those things like,

694
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,230
ah,
if she wants to be like,

695
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:56,190
hey,
look at my fat.

696
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,410
Who gives a fuck?
High five.

697
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,220
Why not a guy can do a joey can do it.
Joe.

698
00:36:01,221 --> 00:36:02,190
He does it all the time.
I mean,

699
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:05,010
in one of the pictures that I had for
vegas that jamie puts,

700
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:11,040
jamie made this picture is what joey
from like the joey karate days when he

701
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,010
was at his heaviest,
he had this giant gut and he's got a

702
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:16,230
shirt off and he's like doing karate
moves.

703
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,700
I mean it's because it's funny.
I mean if I support joey being funny

704
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,440
there.
Melissa mccarthy is fucking victor.

705
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:34,370
It's an ad for the mgm grand.
Were there on March 4th doing it to be

706
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:40,431
funny as opposed to a woman that's
hollywood overweight trying to say,

707
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,601
well,
you know what?

708
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:46,410
This can be sexy to joey's not doing
that to go.

709
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,480
There's are sexy too.
As a fellow comic I always have to look

710
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,870
at it from the perspective of like,
alright,

711
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,950
well what is she trying to do?
Is she trying to be funny?

712
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,320
Or is she trying to say I don't give a
fuck.

713
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,660
She's doing one of those things.
Right.

714
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,020
And either one of those things is.
I'll tell you my opinion of what she's

715
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:14,871
doing is what I hope you fell into that
I fell into when we were at that same

716
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,560
age where we both started getting
compared to bill hicks and getting too

717
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:23,970
much fucking picks.
Pressure.

718
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,940
yes.
And you kind of try to live up to it.

719
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,940
I think she's so big that she feels like
she is the voice for all females because

720
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:38,220
they're telling her she is and she's
probably overcompensating on some level.

721
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,710
Well,
she's probably overwhelmed by the g

722
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:43,470
force of fame.
I mean the g force of family she's

723
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:45,510
experienced and experienced it really
quickly.

724
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,320
Like amy was on the show.
I get to z force of fame and not even

725
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:50,670
two years ago.
Right.

726
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,361
So,
uh,

727
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:55,320
less than a year and a half ago she was
nowhere near as famous as she is now

728
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,290
going to go to africa.
Like chapelle just to get away from this

729
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,124
shit.

730
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,240
She's going to become trans black.
And she does,

731
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:04,260
she have,
um,

732
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,360
she's,
I don't even think she's like 30.

733
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:07,830
Is she 30,
32?

734
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:10,170
I think she's 32.
She's really young,

735
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:10,740
man.
look,

736
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,960
when I was 32,
I was fucking retarded.

737
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,710
I'm retarded now and I'm 48,
but that's when I was 30,

738
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,930
20 fucking,
hey,

739
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:23,420
I was billing ex best friend and you
want to do a video with you though?

740
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,990
Shit.
I Have to live up to that.

741
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,120
Well,
there was always that like you'd get

742
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:29,130
compared to a little kicks,
like,

743
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,720
oh my god,
I can't be myself.

744
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,240
There was like,
you did want to have your own sense of

745
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:35,950
humor.
You wanted to live up to this void that

746
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:36,430
was

747
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,330
left behind.
There was a.

748
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,590
there was a fucking great.
Pete,

749
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:41,020
you know jamie from the atlanta
punchline.

750
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,740
No guy ran a great guy.
I ran into him at the comedy store the

751
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,330
other day and there was a.
Sure.

752
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:48,580
I do know,
but I knew that I guarantee,

753
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:49,840
you know,
did you work at atlanta?

754
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,900
She ever do the punchline.
All I remember is bad shows.

755
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,820
Fucking one of the all time best comedy
clubs.

756
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:57,850
It was a great club.
They just went under the real parking

757
00:38:57,851 --> 00:39:00,100
issue,
so they're moving to a new location,

758
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:04,480
but they took apart the old place and
save pieces of the stage and saved

759
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:09,481
pieces of the green room and the green
room had like shitty fake wood paneling

760
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,790
and on that I'm actually actually be
would,

761
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,130
it might be real wood paneling,
but they went on it,

762
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:17,830
it said so he doesn't get sued.

763
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,290
No,
no,

764
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,080
because I'm kidding.
I'm going to have it here.

765
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,400
Um,
yeah,

766
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,120
there's.
Yeah,

767
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,300
there's one piece I said,
can I please have the piece that says

768
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,100
quit trying to be hicks?
I took a picture of it and I put it up

769
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,720
on the line back when it was stolen from
the Austin Green room.

770
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,360
I don't think they did.
I think this was,

771
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,150
it was an old fucking club that the club
had been around forever,

772
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:43,990
but everybody was saying that at the
time there was a million halfassed hicks

773
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,820
and that's what you could call them
tours.

774
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,740
Yeah.
Well,

775
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,930
like right now there's like 100 of
towels.

776
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,580
There's so many guys who talk like dave,
there's so many,

777
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,830
there's so many fucking that tells,
you know,

778
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:58,990
there's a bunch of.
Patrice is when patrice was alive.

779
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,870
There's a few.
Patrice has quite a few hedbergs oh yeah

780
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,360
man,
but they've kind of branched out into

781
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,430
the road,
which is what happens man.

782
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,990
It's like in the beginning it's what's,
what's awkward is that we're watching

783
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,640
it,
but we all kind of went through like I

784
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:17,290
had a bad richard jeni period,
man where it was onstage and I realized

785
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:22,090
I was like open mic level one year in
and I was onstage and myself.

786
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:23,260
I was like,
oh my god,

787
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:26,140
I'm definitely stealing the way richard
jenny talks.

788
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,260
Like I was talking just like I'm the
same cadence.

789
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,080
I wasn't even being myself,
but I realized that like it's just

790
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:35,170
because I admired them and I was scared.
I was trying to figure out how to do it

791
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:38,500
on my own.
So it becomes a lot of these guys.

792
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:41,440
I think that's what happens.
Like there's guys that had been compared

793
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,870
to hedberg then you can't really say
that anymore.

794
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:45,130
Like you watch them now and you go,
oh,

795
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:48,580
he's found his own little weird thing,
but hannibal burress,

796
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,090
when I first saw hannibal it fucking
brilliant.

797
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:53,741
I go,
wow,

798
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:55,480
he sounds like hedberg it,
and then I go,

799
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:01,300
I think hedbergs stole sounding black
little bit,

800
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:02,940
man,
a little bit.

801
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,190
He had one of my all time favorite jokes
about bananas.

802
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,440
Someone said,
do want a frozen banana?

803
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,313
I said,
no,

804
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,640
but I want a regular banana latest.
So yes,

805
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,240
we going through the litany of our
favorite hedberg and it tells,

806
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,750
and I don't have a girlfriend,
but I do have a girl that would be very

807
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:25,120
upset if she heard me say that.

808
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,230
Yeah,
I knew that girl like that.

809
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,100
So his jokes,
a lot of them

810
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,100
were reality based even though that's
probably why he hated the Steven Wright

811
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,430
comparison where he was saying real
shit.

812
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,080
He really did give free bread to a duck
at subway like that.

813
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,160
These things actually happened and he
wrote it in a way that was hilarious.

814
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,050
You are with them.
Sorry.

815
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,940
When he wrote the joker,
bertha tennis,

816
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,210
we played tennis down.
There

817
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,830
is first a letterman's special.
He did the joke and he dropped my name

818
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:09,620
and I was all excited.
I played tennis with my friend doug,

819
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:12,760
and I realized,
no matter how good I get at tennis,

820
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,830
I'll never be as good as a wall.
He had a gang of them.

821
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,320
He was just one of those guys,
man.

822
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,000
Just very,
uh,

823
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,280
very unique.
It's very hard to compare him to someone

824
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:31,250
else.
He's just his own little weird category.

825
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,820
Fucking shock.
Croft has so much unreleased footage and

826
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,330
she's such a scared to put it.

827
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,210
So I don't know.
and like why wouldn't you put it out?

828
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,730
Well,
because she doesn't what she wants his

829
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:46,790
legacy to be righted.
She's a fuck up like all the rest of my

830
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:49,490
comic friends,
she doesn't get around his shit.

831
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:52,730
So it was stuff that he was working on.
He'd film everything.

832
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,140
Wow.
I have,

833
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:59,290
I have this 30 minute va.
Jesse made me from like 1993 that he

834
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:07,210
shot while we're on the road doing like
Montana run tribble gigs and vancouver

835
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,420
and he just shot and edited back in vhs
days.

836
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:15,530
It wasN't computer era.
You had to actually sit and edit this

837
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,560
and titled it for me and autographed it.
Two minutes just,

838
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:24,380
he's like break dancing in the winter on
some baron road onto a piece of

839
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:29,381
cardboard in Montana
were making out in a kitchen in some

840
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,890
fucking a comedy club in surrey,
bc.

841
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,360
And he fuckIng w we kiss in front of the
cooks just to disturb them.

842
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,430
And he pauses on it and plays.
I want to know what love is.

843
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,050
Just
he was doing that shit though in

844
00:43:48,051 --> 00:43:49,310
[inaudible] 93.
And he,

845
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,720
we were co headlining a b room.
So we were cold,

846
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:56,030
middling basically,
right for no money.

847
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,070
I remember the night we got paid,
we were afraid we weren't going to get

848
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,800
paid because this club was definitely
going under.

849
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,170
Could tell.
And uh,

850
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,570
we're having,
we had to stay in the owner's house and

851
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:10,880
there's the,
the owner didn't even live there.

852
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:15,230
And there's stacks of dirty dishes
higher than the sink and it's just as

853
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,890
bare mattresses were sleeping on in the
basement.

854
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,960
and we're like,
we're going to get fucked out of our

855
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:24,410
money.
And thIs is when if you don't get paid,

856
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,050
you don't get home.
That's your gas.

857
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:30,500
That's everything.
And we finally got paid and then they're

858
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,690
taking us into downtown vancouver
salaries,

859
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,930
a suburb and the door guys that we're
cool,

860
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,550
we're going to take us out to party.

861
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,190
And I was,
they were telling me how hot the hookers

862
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:44,950
were in vancouver.
Streetwalkers oh,

863
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,890
but no,
they were.

864
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,181
Yeah,
we're,

865
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:48,960
we're,
we're,

866
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,820
we're driving past all these hookers.
I go,

867
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:55,821
these are really streetwalker hookers.
Fucking for me a game for you.

868
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,980
Not so much a.
And I'm like,

869
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,890
what's the minimum?
And whatever it was,

870
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:03,540
they said like 50 bucks.
And I go,

871
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,800
all right,
here's,

872
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,400
I think I got paid like 600 bucks or
something.

873
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,960
I go,
here's the rest of my money.

874
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,720
I'm just taking 50 bucks.
I can't get ripped off.

875
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,780
Drop me off next to her and picked me up
half an hour.

876
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:20,730
So they dropped me off.
I go up to her and the minimum is 100

877
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:23,560
bucks minimum.
Yeah.

878
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:27,300
Well I only have 50 cause they told me
it was 50.

879
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,690
Nope.
So I just sit on a bus bench next to a

880
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,970
book or working on a sidewalk for 29
more minutes waiting for my friend to

881
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:38,410
come pick me up.
Why would you go to a hooker with fifth,

882
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,260
1994 60 bucks.
That's what this.

883
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,290
The guys who dropped me off told me I
was fucking whatever.

884
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,220
Hobby 94.
so 20 slash 67.

885
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:54,600
Yeah,
something.

886
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,880
Something along those law.
ThInking about my dick,

887
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:59,370
dick made the worst choices in my life.

888
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,730
Vancouver is one of the strangest
fucking places because it's Canada,

889
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:09,060
but it's a.
It's almost like America,

890
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,560
Canada,
you know?

891
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,780
It's like,
it's so seattle.

892
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:15,210
It's like it's right there.
Like portland,

893
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,290
seattle.
It's almost,

894
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,160
it's more sanford,
cisco in the pc and yeah,

895
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:26,760
this piece of a lot.
There's a lot of wild people there to.

896
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,460
Vancouver's got a lot a.
While people will say it's almost like a

897
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:32,520
cisco,
but the ones that are conserved very.

898
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,430
It's almost like if anchorage fuck san
francisco,

899
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,920
it would make vancouver.
Right?

900
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,410
I was trying to think of a good heroin
city because there's a lot of heroin up

901
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:46,140
there,
but in anchorage or in know in

902
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:49,620
vancouver,
it's huge heroin that would go the place

903
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:52,140
we play.
Brian's never been tHere.

904
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:55,940
That's why he keeps booking me back.
Uh,

905
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,790
the rick shaw and it's in the heroin
district,

906
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,010
which they have a heroin,
might as well be,

907
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,821
you know,
wherever the,

908
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:05,070
all the fucking syrian refugees go.
Now.

909
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:09,600
There's lIke,
if you've ever seen a full street flea

910
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:13,470
market
that's a homeless people like every

911
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:18,471
single inch of the entire street across
the street from that gig is homeless

912
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:19,950
tents.
And you think,

913
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,570
oh,
is this an open air market?

914
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:24,060
No,
that's fucking homeless junkies.

915
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:29,090
All the entire sidewalk for four blocks
is just wandering,

916
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,100
vagabond junkie street people.
I don't want to erwin district look at

917
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:37,510
this.
Look at the picture now.

918
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,373
Fuck.
Yeah,

919
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,410
that's nuts.
Can I just say it's a very good deal.

920
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,330
So you get what you pay for in this
world,

921
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:46,751
right?
No,

922
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:50,510
no.
The door door door deal saw standing.

923
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,320
Jesus christ.
No,

924
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:55,030
that's an actual restaurant.
Don't you tell him,

925
00:47:55,031 --> 00:47:57,400
hey man,
let's place blows.

926
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,640
Generally I do,
but sometimes I don't remember.

927
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,760
I explained the financial alternatives.
Yeah,

928
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,500
you can't.
You can't let that get involved in your

929
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:12,330
business.
Can't let the financial alternatives get

930
00:48:12,331 --> 00:48:15,610
involved in your business.
Standing out in that back alley smoking

931
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:17,710
and as you're,
you're literally going,

932
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:22,711
can I get some duct tape for my pant
legs because there's rats are running so

933
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,970
rapidly that you're just thinking,
oh,

934
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:27,970
that could run up my leg.
THere's that many of them and raw

935
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,980
sewage,
thick raw sewage.

936
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,100
I was just thinking about the poor hook
and working for 50 bucks.

937
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,650
Keep fixating on that.
No,

938
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,740
she was 100 bucks.
I get lied.

939
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:40,540
Is there has to be a girl there that was
working for 50

940
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,720
drive through Utah and you go through a
drive through in st george and there's

941
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:51,721
this perfect platinum blonde 19 year old
working the drive through and you go to

942
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,560
fuck you doing here.
Well,

943
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:55,800
becauSe they all looked at good.
Oh,

944
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,470
I didn't get to Utah on toes in my
forties.

945
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,710
Well you haven't lived.

946
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,360
You know what I do love though is salt
lake city,

947
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,600
like doing standup and salt lake city,
it's like everything has got like a

948
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:13,630
little extra kick to it because it's
like because they don't get it,

949
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,790
they get it,
they don't get it.

950
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:17,980
I get it.
That type of entertainment.

951
00:49:17,981 --> 00:49:20,540
So the ones that are into it are.
Yeah.

952
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,260
It's like playing the antarctic,
which I really want to do.

953
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,370
The antarctic.
Wow.

954
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:29,410
That's a space station station,
station station,

955
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:30,710
whatever it is.
Yeah.

956
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:34,390
I watched a documentary on that place
mat.

957
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,420
Murderous mcmurdo isn't mcmurdo.
Yeah,

958
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,000
I see.
I think everybody gets it now.

959
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,040
There's like pockets of people
everywhere.

960
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:44,490
They get it like so like salt lake city
is not.

961
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:48,580
It's not Just a giant mormon stronghold.
It's also a bunch of people that just

962
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:52,450
live theRe and it's beautiful.
And as far as the stigma,

963
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:58,670
so people would might issue the place
because I don't want to fuck salt lake.

964
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:00,070
Exactly.
And they're lIke,

965
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,390
no,
we're better now.

966
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,140
Well,
it's a good spot because of all those

967
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:09,510
things because it's underrated because
everyone's so scared that it's a cult

968
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,580
city and it is a fucking cult city by
the way.

969
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:13,440
Uh,
I,

970
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,510
I arrived at the airport like a few
months back,

971
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,420
landed as we're going down the
escalator.

972
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,180
You see these fucking people welcomed
back.

973
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,830
Elder michael,
like,

974
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:27,770
welcome back to the elders.
They're fucking 20 and they're calling

975
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:28,604
them elders

976
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:32,240
and they're coming back from convincing
some people that don't even have clean

977
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:33,710
water that they need to

978
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,430
embrace the joseph.
Yeah,

979
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,210
the mormon doctrIne.
That's why your water's dirty.

980
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,920
Joseph smith hasn't been here.

981
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,130
So bizarre man.
It's so bizarre.

982
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:45,580
They make them do it.
They make them go to these con.

983
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,560
That's like part of their gig is that
they have to proselytize.

984
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,200
They have to go to these weird places
and missions.

985
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,550
Yeah,
it's fucking nuts

986
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,540
span.
Comic friend of mine went on the

987
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,630
tabernacle tour.
What's that?

988
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,320
Touring the mormon tabernacle.
And they have a tour just like the

989
00:51:01,321 --> 00:51:04,950
vatican would.
And you can tour the tabernacle and he

990
00:51:04,951 --> 00:51:08,640
just kept asking about the mormon
meadows massacre.

991
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:10,500
And uh,
I think it was 18,

992
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:13,110
57,
I know as nine slash 11 where they

993
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:17,290
murdered the mormons,
murdered all these people and oh yeah,

994
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:20,820
fucking unknown story.
But google it at home.

995
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,810
Mormons meadows massacre.
So,

996
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:23,761
uh,
yeah.

997
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:26,610
But what about that more dot better.
And they've finally,

998
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,680
someone pulled them aside.
Sarah,

999
00:51:28,681 --> 00:51:31,500
I'd like to show you something this way.
And they showed them right out the

1000
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:35,970
fucking door because he wouldn't stop
with the mormons metal massacre.

1001
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:40,000
DId you know all about mitt romney?
Did you know the whole Mexico thing?

1002
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:41,410
No.
No.

1003
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,240
Oh,
let me tell you something.

1004
00:51:43,241 --> 00:51:46,240
So beautiful.
Mitt romney's family,

1005
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,370
like mitt romney's dad wanted to be
president,

1006
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,240
but he couldn't be president because he
was born in Mexico because mitt romney's

1007
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:57,241
family fleed to Mexico.
When they made polygamy illegal,

1008
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,190
when they made it illegal to marry a
bunch of chicks,

1009
00:52:00,191 --> 00:52:01,450
which is a part of their church.
They went,

1010
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,940
fuck you.
we're going to Mexico because back in

1011
00:52:03,941 --> 00:52:06,790
the 18 hundreds didn't mean anything to
live in the United States or Mexico

1012
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:10,210
because everybody's on a fucking horse.
It's not like being on a Horse over here

1013
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,160
is way more awesome than being on a
horse over here.

1014
00:52:12,161 --> 00:52:14,770
It's bullshit.
You go back and forth as you will near a

1015
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:16,540
running stream.
I'm better thaN you.

1016
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:17,650
Yeah.
it's all that mattered.

1017
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,530
Especially in the 18 hundreds of the
porter was nothing.

1018
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:23,170
It was nonexistent,
so they didn't want it here to the new

1019
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:27,040
United States Laws against their
religious freedom to marry 15,

1020
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,980
12 year olds,
so they decided to move to Mexico.

1021
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,500
So His whole fucking family is from
Mexico.

1022
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,470
Mitt romNey's family.
His dad's from Mexico.

1023
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,620
My mom's from Mexico.
They're aLl a part of the mormon cult

1024
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:43,540
from down there or religion as it were,
but they have fucking guns and they

1025
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:46,330
fight off the cartel because they get
kidnapped.

1026
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,510
There's a bunch of fuckIng crazy shit
that goes on down there.

1027
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,800
There's a couple of different families
and vice went down there and did a doc

1028
00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:57,770
on it to notice how I say doc because
I'm working in the industry like an

1029
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,650
abbreviated shit.
It makes me look cool.

1030
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,490
TwItter trains you to abbreviate.
I know.

1031
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:03,280
It's terrible.
No,

1032
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,890
it's good.
They did one of their hours

1033
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:09,530
or one of their videos online.
I'll just say that and it was all about

1034
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:13,910
these mormons that live in Mexico still
and they have a fucking compound,

1035
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,960
like an armed waco style compound and
that's where he came from.

1036
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,350
So essentially it's like that guy from
david koresh.

1037
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,360
Imagine david koresh,
his son.

1038
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,130
Okay.
Moves to Mexico

1039
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,430
and runs for president.
That is what it's like.

1040
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,910
It's like that similar.
I mean oBviously like dude crush I guess

1041
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,860
like shots and federal agents chill like
that.

1042
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:39,840
So it gets a little trickier,
but there's this branches out into a

1043
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,300
Whole bunch of uva,
but these fucking people have.

1044
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,430
They have,
they have guns and they have to fight

1045
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:48,360
off the bad guys in Mexico.
Like they're stuck dOwn there like this

1046
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:52,140
is where they've decided to like look
white people that look like they're from

1047
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:54,060
fucking Utah and they were living in
Mexico.

1048
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,680
It's weird as fuck,
man.

1049
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,230
It's really weird.
It's real weird.

1050
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:02,430
But if we started a compounded because
our opinions are not popular,

1051
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,280
fuck this.
I'm going to go to some other country or

1052
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,040
place where no one fucks with us and
we're going to have this death valley

1053
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,220
party for life.
Why Not?

1054
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,360
Definitely.
Why not?

1055
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,630
No,
I'm don't get me wrong.

1056
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,080
Mitt romney for having a fucked up
parents.

1057
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:22,330
He was.
He's not down there fucking tweLve year

1058
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,760
olds.
Not warren jeffs.

1059
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,530
you will.
You can't even belIeve brain.

1060
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,620
David koresh.
If david koresh gotten to situation,

1061
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:33,240
we had a bunch of people and he made
them all have their wives sleep with

1062
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:37,500
them like that's fucking his keys.
Stopped calling it a cult and start

1063
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:41,790
calling it a fan base.
All of a sudden you're living the free

1064
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:43,320
market.
American dream.

1065
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,560
The problem is you label it.
It's all about tHe nomenclature.

1066
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:52,320
you got to label it correctly.
That's what the whole scientology thing

1067
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:53,940
was about.
The nomenclature of whether it's a

1068
00:54:53,941 --> 00:54:54,890
church or whether it's.
So.

1069
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,260
Yeah.
That koresh guy was charismatic and he

1070
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,520
had a lot of fans,
right?

1071
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,160
Yeah.
That's really what use them.

1072
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,620
If they're having a good time,
who's to say his comedy stinks?

1073
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,630
Yeah,
and like these guys,

1074
00:55:06,631 --> 00:55:09,960
if they want to stay a deal's a deal,
you've got to let the cult leader fuck

1075
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:14,040
your wife.
That's just how it goes and it's not

1076
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:16,110
like we can't do the same thing in
comedy.

1077
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,160
Hey,
sorry buddy.

1078
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:22,530
She cAme with me after the show.
Jesus says it's okay,

1079
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:23,560
man.
Do.

1080
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:27,090
Did you really move with the comedian?
How terrible.

1081
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,320
I'm leaving this colt.

1082
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:36,050
It's funny that even in 2016 there's
ones that will buy into and ones who

1083
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,970
were like,
that was fucking stupid.

1084
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,100
You know,
there's like as a culture,

1085
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,320
as a society,
we get the main ones.

1086
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:47,730
It's almost like political parties
because it's just as ridiculous to have

1087
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:52,731
the democrats or libertarians or the
green party or because it's ridiculous.

1088
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,740
Just having leaders is ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

1089
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:59,520
All of it's ridiculous.
It's all in some ancient hominid

1090
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,640
bullshit that we have stuck in our
genetics.

1091
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:06,660
We think we have to have one leader that
stands over all of us and fucking

1092
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:09,180
where's the special suit and puts his
hand up.

1093
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:10,770
We all applaud.
It's retarded.

1094
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,270
It's retarded,
it's ancient.

1095
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,910
It's so archaic.
It's just fucking stupid.

1096
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,110
We've got to,
yeah,

1097
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,000
but if you're the first guy to not,
then you're.

1098
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,180
Then you're a dildo.
Well,

1099
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,320
it's someone's going to have to figure
out how to break it.

1100
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,320
Like they're going to have to like it.
It almost is going to take it and you

1101
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:28,120
know what?
It's going to take no one running for

1102
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:30,040
president.
The charIsmatic leader,

1103
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,870
unfortunately,
and you'd have to get a charismatic

1104
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:36,380
leader that definitely didn't want to
fuck.

1105
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,250
Listen.
Absolutely.

1106
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,970
Everyone follow me and not following me.
Yes.

1107
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:45,460
That's the move.
People don't want to fuck fend for

1108
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:49,270
themselves.
I think we're gonna have to come up with

1109
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:52,750
in like in our lifetime,
people are going to realize that there's

1110
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:57,250
a lot of things that are just in place
that were we were born with and the

1111
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,890
people that set them up,
they just did not have access to the

1112
00:56:59,891 --> 00:57:02,710
information that they needed to form
those decisions.

1113
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:06,070
Like the reason why they started off the
electoral college.

1114
00:57:06,071 --> 00:57:09,790
All the bullshit that we have to contend
with today is because it made sense in

1115
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,080
1776.

1116
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,480
It made sense.
They were just trying to piece together

1117
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:15,010
this thing,
but to stick with that,

1118
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,440
to stick with that,
every time someone says,

1119
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,830
you know what,
in the constitution it says,

1120
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:21,880
well,
you know what,

1121
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,640
if you can make a better constitution,
make it.

1122
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,490
If you can make that's going to
progress.

1123
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,060
I think there's a bunch of things we
have to agree on if we want to call

1124
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:36,061
ourselves America because otherwise we
become some like we've become like a

1125
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:40,510
fuckin
become like the mantra with you and I

1126
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:45,040
versus the mantra with adam and jimmy
comes up with the same name.

1127
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,170
It's like,
what is this fucking thing?

1128
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:50,920
This is not what I signed up for.
Everybody signed up for America and the

1129
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:53,140
idea of America,
it's supposed to be freedom of speech.

1130
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,590
That's a big one.
Right?

1131
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,750
But how many people today are in trouble
for talking about?

1132
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,680
Shit.
I mean,

1133
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:04,590
how many people today are in trouble for
revealing information or talking out

1134
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,600
about things that they changed the
ellsberg verses snowden or chelsea

1135
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:11,770
manning?
Sure.

1136
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,660
Yeah.
Ellsberg's a fucking hero.

1137
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:14,650
Okay.
You went with chelsea?

1138
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,380
Yeah,
like I did the correct gender.

1139
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,593
I did,
yes.

1140
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:24,300
I had a lot of full of stimulants and
viagra and the fucking chick I thought

1141
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:27,360
was a short thing,
turned out to be a dude.

1142
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,851
No,
no,

1143
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:29,400
no.
The dale done.

1144
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,370
So.
Oh,

1145
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:35,350
you've researched online.
She on a hey arrows guide is added.

1146
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:37,240
Dude.
I can't tell if that's a dude from the

1147
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:38,950
picture.
I'm just going to not call.

1148
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:43,300
Sometimes arrows got better than you.
Porn is looking up.

1149
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:45,970
Hookers you could actually get and then
jerking off.

1150
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:46,830
No one.
You know what?

1151
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,530
For 800 bucks I could get her,
but I'd have to wait 35 minutes.

1152
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:54,100
I reaLly think the girl in that photo is
actually going to come to your door.

1153
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:59,101
They should take your credit card and
sell it to India really should.

1154
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:03,340
Whatever they do to your credIt card
when you fucking to call and leave that

1155
00:59:03,341 --> 00:59:06,330
visa card for the deposit.
Got you.

1156
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,670
And love the people.
Actually buy credit card protection

1157
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,320
without knowing that.
you know what?

1158
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:15,040
if you didn't sign for it,
it's the credit card that's eating it,

1159
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:19,000
not you.
Where I went to The Bahamas once and

1160
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:22,080
came back and there was a charge for
thousand

1161
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,970
plus dollars for porcelain tile.
Yeah,

1162
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:30,470
that's what I do when I'm on vacation.
I bought it porcelain kitchen tile.

1163
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:36,100
$7,000 worth of credit card company eats
it wise.

1164
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,360
That's what they have to do.
So all those,

1165
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,640
you know,
Interested anyone steal your identity or

1166
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,120
steal your credit card will protect you
against that.

1167
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,390
Know the fucking vehcile,
eat it.

1168
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:50,200
Fuck you.
leave that shit laying out and then I'll

1169
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,620
say,
I didn't sign for it.

1170
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:56,180
I,
I have this idea about information that

1171
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:59,090
money essentially.
It doesn't really mean anything anymore,

1172
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:00,560
right?
It's not backed by gold.

1173
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,170
It's just all stored up on a computer
somewhere.

1174
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:05,090
We agree that $100,
$100,

1175
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,690
but the.
So that's the theory.

1176
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:10,310
That's fact,
but it's data.

1177
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:13,100
It's just just ones and zeros.
There's no physical thing.

1178
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,740
Well,
the thing what's happening with

1179
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:20,090
technology is technology is bringing
people and ideas like closer together

1180
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,280
quicker.
Like if you have an idea,

1181
01:00:22,281 --> 01:00:26,540
you tweeted a fucking 100,000 people
might get ahold of that idea within a

1182
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:26,960
couple of seconds,
right?

1183
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,250
Videos,
you put up a video,

1184
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:29,390
it gets crazy,
it gets viral.

1185
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:34,020
A million people and I see it in day or
two that the more technology improves,

1186
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:36,740
the quicker and easier it is to get to
people quicker.

1187
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:38,510
It easy.
It is to communicate well.

1188
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,540
Money is information and communication.
It's just about information.

1189
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,110
We might come a time where the
bottleneck is money,

1190
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:50,380
like we can't have possessions in order
to be this one in order to everyone

1191
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:56,410
connects together and some sort of a
weIrd artificial evolution induced like

1192
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,700
connection to technology that we're
inevitably going to have.

1193
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:02,780
Well,
it's common.

1194
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,450
It's going to happen.
The bottleneck might be money.

1195
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,770
I think we're going to get to a point
where money's not real and instead of

1196
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:11,600
drinking,
because I had no idea what you said,

1197
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:12,770
but I nodded a lot.

1198
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,320
I think we're going to get to a point
where there's no more money.

1199
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:22,910
I think that's what's going to happen.
We're going to get to some weird point.

1200
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:27,370
We're gonna get to a lot of weird points
that we're not going to be here for and

1201
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,850
the differences.
You have kids so you worry about it a

1202
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:33,210
little bit more than I do.
Probably go.

1203
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:37,030
Wow.
Well I mean everything from 100 years

1204
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:42,031
ago that you could not possibly imagine
that are happening now is happening now.

1205
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,430
Yeah,
so a lot of weird shit we can't even

1206
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:48,310
imagine will happen and I just won't be
here for it,

1207
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,500
but isn't it really cool at the same
time?

1208
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:53,550
It's not.
It's not like it's not negative.

1209
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,770
It's like even the loss of moneY,
like this idea,

1210
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,410
like look,
everyone's the negative people that are

1211
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:01,540
the problem,
global warming and yes,

1212
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:05,050
shit's going to go underwater and it's
not going to be the Maldives anymore,

1213
01:02:05,051 --> 01:02:08,590
but it's going to be warmer in Wisconsin
and what?

1214
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:11,950
You shouldn't be fucking in having that
many kids next to what coastline

1215
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,890
katrina,
we're going to rebuild new orleans.

1216
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,130
Oh,
The water's rising and you live under

1217
01:02:18,131 --> 01:02:21,330
the sea level of fuck you drown your
kids.

1218
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,970
You fucking asshole.
Courageous.

1219
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,560
You're not going to get to host our
event.

1220
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:28,320
Now emc,
our event,

1221
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:31,590
after that,
we have rescinded our offer.

1222
01:02:31,591 --> 01:02:33,360
Mr stan ho,
we,

1223
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:38,010
uh,
we cannot endorse your fingers out there

1224
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:42,600
if you're going to Bring your own booze
and poured into a candidate drag club

1225
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:45,360
soda bottle and you're mixing it with
club soda.

1226
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:49,140
Make sure your realize Which club sodas,
vodka.

1227
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:52,650
I just poured a whole fuck load of vodka
in this thinking.

1228
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:55,950
It was a shake and get real.
Oh my god,

1229
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,590
I can't say the wrong thing.
There's a lot of vodka.

1230
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,321
Vodka.
Oh no,

1231
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:00,650
no,

1232
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:03,920
there's a lot of it's ice.
Sorry you couldn't fucking pro.

1233
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,320
I know I have full.
As long as they don't try to smoke your

1234
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:09,890
weed and things go south.
It could be worse.

1235
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:11,240
You could be drinking himself.
Super.

1236
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,990
It's been a long week.
What will we,

1237
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:19,730
what were you just talking about?
You were just sayIng something that was

1238
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:21,650
really interesting.
What the fuck did you just say?

1239
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:23,150
Just before that.
Oh.

1240
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,510
Oh.
About worrying about the future more

1241
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,250
because I have children.
That's probably true,

1242
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,080
but you know what?
It's not just that.

1243
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:34,770
It's not even necessarily worrying.
It's about like if I see a pattern and

1244
01:03:34,771 --> 01:03:38,240
then I see some things happening,
I think I see a bunch of things that are

1245
01:03:38,241 --> 01:03:41,330
moving in a certain direction because
just like you,

1246
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,950
I don't have a conventional job.
I'm not overwhelmed with having to do

1247
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:49,550
shit that other people want me to do,
so most of my day spent thinking about

1248
01:03:49,551 --> 01:03:53,000
shit that I want to think about,
so when I look at this whole weird

1249
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:54,350
pattern like what are we doing?

1250
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:58,880
Like what is this society doing?
Were some weird fucking builder creature

1251
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,210
that's making better and better
technology every year because that's

1252
01:04:02,211 --> 01:04:05,690
ultimately what we're doing,
but forget about all the shit about the

1253
01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:09,860
kardashians and all the shit about the
democrats and the liberals and

1254
01:04:09,861 --> 01:04:13,580
transgender rights and we're making
better and better technology.

1255
01:04:13,581 --> 01:04:16,520
All that other stuff just allows us to
have fun while we're doing it.

1256
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:21,700
Just creates conflict and resolutions
and $50 hookers and all that shit just

1257
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,830
rose up together,
but the.

1258
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,470
At the end of the day,
what we're doing is making better and

1259
01:04:27,471 --> 01:04:29,660
better technology.
That's all we're doing.

1260
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:32,360
That's the one constant.
If we stay alive,

1261
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:34,310
we innovate,
we stay alive,

1262
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:34,950
we keep going.

1263
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:39,950
But if innovation,
if you have to keep making more shit

1264
01:04:39,991 --> 01:04:42,840
just to make people buy more shit.
Like,

1265
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:45,330
isn't this shit we have enough.
Exactly.

1266
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,290
it's true.
Yeah.

1267
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,680
It isn't us since we live a comfortable
lifestyle.

1268
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:52,860
There was some story today where,
uh,

1269
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:57,900
if the 62 richest americans gave way,
most are their wealth,

1270
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,590
everyone would live above the poverty
line and you go,

1271
01:05:01,591 --> 01:05:03,870
but then there would be a new poverty
line.

1272
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:08,670
So then those people.
At what point do you go,

1273
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:09,504
well,
I'm,

1274
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,270
I'm rich enough,
we got enough shit,

1275
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,260
but I live above the poverty line
because zuckerberg gave me a bunch of

1276
01:05:16,261 --> 01:05:18,010
shit and now I

1277
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:22,480
live in a one bedroom instead of a tent
or a cardboard box.

1278
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,960
Well then now you live in a one bedroom
and you see the guy in the two bedroom

1279
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:29,110
and you go fucking dick.
Exactly.

1280
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:32,080
So what's going to happen on the poverty
line again?

1281
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:33,670
Yeah.
You're not going to enjoy your studio

1282
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:35,830
apartment.
Fuck that guy with his fucking two

1283
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:37,750
bedroom.
You asshole.

1284
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:41,230
Poverty line is a statistic.
Just like football as well,

1285
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:43,330
there's a problem with getting shit for
free.

1286
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,100
There's always a problem with getting
shipped for free.

1287
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,830
That's not a problem.
Now you porn.

1288
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,880
I thought it was going to give me a
cease and desist.

1289
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:50,470
Gone.
Right?

1290
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,370
It's this,
this,

1291
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:56,380
this.
This is like free samples at the safeway

1292
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,770
and you just grabbed the whole fucking
trey and ate them all at once.

1293
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,340
You fucking asshole.
Stop with your cocaine and your viagra.

1294
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,230
Well don't,
they don't.

1295
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:06,580
I'm,
I don't know if this is true,

1296
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:11,581
but you could tell me don't date like
isn't there like a conflict in the porn

1297
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:15,280
industry with the porn.
People aren't getting paid for those

1298
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:19,510
movies and they put them up for free and
so like people shouldn't be supporting

1299
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,720
those sites.
Like there's like a,

1300
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,360
there's like a dispute and a debate
almost like a,

1301
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:30,390
the napster daYs when what's his face?
Metallica will get really mad when lars

1302
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:35,200
ulrich fucking it can.
People still hate that guy from that?

1303
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:38,720
I do.
I always swore if I ever saw him in a

1304
01:06:38,721 --> 01:06:40,600
show,
I would have him escorted out.

1305
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,690
And then one time you were with me in
mill valley,

1306
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:47,900
the other guy got hurt.
That's hetfield or whatever his name.

1307
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:49,990
He was there.
He was there and I said,

1308
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:53,230
I always swerve.
That fucking guy was here and you're

1309
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:55,030
close enough,
but I'm not going to throw you out.

1310
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,770
And I just started giving him shit
about.

1311
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:02,160
I was like the first comic on napster.
Like they had a home page where they

1312
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,760
feature an artist right before they shut
him down.

1313
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,200
Yeah,
that's right.

1314
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:10,950
Yeah.
And I was the first comic feature as

1315
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,010
when people first started finding my
shit under ground and then they shut it

1316
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:17,950
down because of that fucking lars.
oh.

1317
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:22,990
And they made their bones off of people
bootlegging cassette tapes of them

1318
01:07:22,991 --> 01:07:27,010
because they couldn't get radio play
like you're shitting on.

1319
01:07:27,011 --> 01:07:29,650
What made you,
you fucking little weasley?

1320
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,480
I don't know.
Is he norwegian?

1321
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:34,760
What is he fucking know danish?
Whatever it is,

1322
01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:39,070
there's no need disparaging an entire
race of people just because of one man's

1323
01:07:39,071 --> 01:07:41,310
actions.
Douglas one male,

1324
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,780
he fucked up.
He definitely didn't have good friends.

1325
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,860
He definitely didn't have somebody who
would give them some good advice too,

1326
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:51,580
and I'd kill the whole indian race just
for that one crying fucking guy on that

1327
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:52,570
commercial.
Sorry.

1328
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:54,220
That was a stretch.
That one didn't,

1329
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:55,750
but whatever.
Sorry.

1330
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:59,140
Swinging in every one of yours because
this is true ladies and gentlemen,

1331
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,880
like when we're,
if we fail,

1332
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:02,710
it's not because we didn't try.
Okay.

1333
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,680
Don't get mad.
They still might only.

1334
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:10,681
There's only a 444,000 hours of a joe
rogan podcast.

1335
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:12,603
Yeah.
That other.

1336
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,860
How do you do this?
It's not hard.

1337
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,100
No,
but I'm saying you put

1338
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:21,100
out like 48 podcasts a week and the new
wrestle guys and then he'd do mma and

1339
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:26,090
then you do the 85 hours of standup.
And then uh,

1340
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:30,260
I have my own kind of crazy.
I got my own sleep.

1341
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:32,890
Are you one of those guys who sleeps two
hours a night?

1342
01:08:32,891 --> 01:08:34,960
I sleep good.
I like to sleep solid six,

1343
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,430
seven hours a night.
I'm not saying how do you sleep at

1344
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:38,720
night?
I got to get eight.

1345
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,360
What do you mean in my life?
Do I have a problem sleeping?

1346
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:45,110
No,
I'm saying what do you have like off

1347
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:46,700
hours?
I want to.

1348
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:50,240
This is my goal in life and have
essentially achieved it.

1349
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:53,120
I want to do what I want to do when I
want to do it within reason,

1350
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:56,750
within moral and ethical obligations,
the law and all that kind of stuff,

1351
01:08:56,751 --> 01:09:00,350
but I don't want.
If I decide I want to go to bed at 5:00

1352
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:02,930
in the morning,
I don't want to hear shit from anybody.

1353
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,380
Like I don't wanna I don't want anybody
telling me you can't go to bed at 5:00

1354
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:07,970
in the morning.
You can't sleep until two in the

1355
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:10,670
afternoon.
Why not tell me why not?

1356
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,500
Why can't I wake up at noon?
Why?

1357
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,360
Who the fuck are you?
It's a stupid.

1358
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:18,440
So all my life I've wanted to get to a
place where I could go to bed when I

1359
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:21,770
wanted to go to bed within reason and
wake up whenever I want to wake up.

1360
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:25,970
So then if I decided to get up early,
like because I have to like see my kids

1361
01:09:25,971 --> 01:09:29,480
at school,
I decide because I have a boss,

1362
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,400
it's because I want to because I want to
get up,

1363
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:34,730
I have an obligation to be with the kids
and I enjoy it and want to hang out with

1364
01:09:34,731 --> 01:09:35,750
them.
It's like,

1365
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,420
I think that if,
if you got to go in life,

1366
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:41,780
the goal shouldn't be,
be as successful as you can be.

1367
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,980
I think the goal,
like it's not a money thing,

1368
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:51,220
the goal is to make it as much like what
shit you would normally do.

1369
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:55,970
Like give her a driven guy.
But my point is the opposite.

1370
01:09:55,971 --> 01:10:00,971
You're always driven to do something.
It's the same shit every time I talked

1371
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:02,071
to,
uh,

1372
01:10:02,071 --> 01:10:04,970
tell you what,
why don't you just take a vacation and

1373
01:10:04,971 --> 01:10:09,520
just go fucking sit on a beach somewhere
because he's always not your,

1374
01:10:09,521 --> 01:10:12,860
your positive.
Intel's always negative steak.

1375
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:13,970
I lifted up,
I said,

1376
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:15,350
buy cds.
No good.

1377
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,370
Everything.
Steaks.

1378
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,590
He makes me sad like that because he's
so brIlliant.

1379
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:19,870
But it's such a nice kid.
I know.

1380
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,880
I can't imagine either of you going to a
remote beach and relaxing.

1381
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:25,873
Oh,
I relaxed.

1382
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:28,520
I know how to do that.
Now I learned how to do that.

1383
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,930
Give me an example.
I go on vAcations where it's the last

1384
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:33,500
one.

1385
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,710
Costa rica went like six months ago with
the family.

1386
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,720
Had a great tIme,
did some zip lining.

1387
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:40,340
Fucking hung out.
Fed some monkeys.

1388
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,570
Nice.
There was this thing called,

1389
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:43,430
we called it a pika chu,
I forget what it's called.

1390
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:48,400
I think it's called the
something ceto something ceto,

1391
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,350
but it looks like a little raccoon,
but they're fucking super team because

1392
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:55,020
they were hanging around this resort and
they're just used to vacationers so they

1393
01:10:55,021 --> 01:10:56,960
come right up to you and we were feeding
him grapes and shit.

1394
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,420
He got so Comfortable with us.
He took a nap in front of us.

1395
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:02,180
Fucking things lying.
They're lying down with his fucking legs

1396
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:05,060
up in the air.
It was an awesome monkey scReaming at

1397
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:06,260
you,
screaming at you.

1398
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:08,270
Come on over here trying to get food
from you.

1399
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,160
Chuck them some fucking oreos.
They opened the oreo up and they.

1400
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,010
They eat the white part just like a
little kid.

1401
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:14,420
Whoa.

1402
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,080
Well how many oreos you eaten?
Monkey.

1403
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,680
So I go on vacation.
So I go on a lot of them.

1404
01:11:19,681 --> 01:11:20,514
Actually.
No,

1405
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:23,490
not a lot of time.
You talk about coming to biz be I go,

1406
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:26,310
you'd be so bored here.
we'd do some fun shit.

1407
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,690
You know,
we do go,

1408
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:30,350
uh,

1409
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,180
isn't go fuck up some havalinas I.
Wow.

1410
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,630
I am against hunting.
Not against it.

1411
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,680
I personally couldn't do it,
but a heavily.

1412
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:41,190
And I could kill that Motherfucker.
Yeah,

1413
01:11:41,191 --> 01:11:43,380
you could do it.
That rotten beasts.

1414
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:46,020
Well,
when you tolD me that dog killed your

1415
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:46,900
neighbor's dog.
Yeah.

1416
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:49,380
Killed the fucKing.
Then they hang around in packs.

1417
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:52,840
I like coyotes.
They're fucking awful demons.

1418
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,930
They're little demons.
If they didn't exist,

1419
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:56,460
if they weren't real,
he'd be like,

1420
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:59,130
whoa,
these are cat eating dog eating little

1421
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,750
demons.
That just doesn't.

1422
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,460
They don't have the courage to go after
a person,

1423
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:05,730
but they would.
if your child was blind or if somebody

1424
01:12:05,731 --> 01:12:08,820
like put a baby on the side of a toyota
tundra and just drove a few hundred

1425
01:12:08,821 --> 01:12:11,980
bottles and on the road,
I just left that baby there for an hour

1426
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:14,670
and the the those peccaries.
That's what they are.

1427
01:12:14,671 --> 01:12:17,060
They're peccaries.
I don't even pigs havoline.

1428
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,290
Everything's is a pig.
Is a pig,

1429
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,150
is a difference.
Different species.

1430
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:24,120
It's a different animal.
That's that fucking creepy fucker.

1431
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:25,670
That's a peccary.
Peccary.

1432
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:26,231
Yeah,
yeah,

1433
01:12:26,231 --> 01:12:28,290
yeah.
We get on a pig,

1434
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,760
but it's not.
my neighborhood is a three streets and

1435
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:37,761
then hills to the mexican border and I
can tell when a pack I have alina are

1436
01:12:38,461 --> 01:12:40,410
coming by.
the dogs barking.

1437
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:45,760
Dogs are barking on that blog now.
They're barking on this block now and I

1438
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,480
owe a pack a heavily.
Is trAveling that way.

1439
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:51,180
That's so cool that you live in a place
that has these things.

1440
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:53,660
It's so interesting.
Yeah.

1441
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,810
They're like rats and fucking vancouver
behind the rick shot theater.

1442
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:00,000
Always.
Always be branding.

1443
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,220
They're like little demons,
man.

1444
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:05,010
Like if they didn't exist,
if they didn't exist,

1445
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,820
there was this hairy thing in a movie
that would chase after people's dogs and

1446
01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:09,860
tear them apart.
Yeah.

1447
01:13:09,861 --> 01:13:12,270
That's where I'm the opposite of ted
nugent.

1448
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:15,780
I would kill that and use none of it,
but they're good.

1449
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:19,020
You can eat them like similar to a pig
and a lot of ways.

1450
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,540
The best people in Louisiana eat shit
they find on the road too.

1451
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,990
But you can.
You can eat a lot of things.

1452
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:29,160
If you're in shackleton's party,
you can eat your shoe until you can find

1453
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:30,660
seal,
blubber.

1454
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:34,590
You can eat anything.
I think they taste good.

1455
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,300
I think heavily is supposed to taste a
lot.

1456
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,350
Very pig.
Like,

1457
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,780
like wild pig,
like wild boar,

1458
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:41,550
which is good.
I think you have to make it and like

1459
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:43,620
sausages and shit,
but the people like it.

1460
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:45,660
I'm still.
I bought burger king,

1461
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:51,100
you know,
you hit burger king,

1462
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,700
burger king,
and I told the uber driver,

1463
01:13:53,701 --> 01:13:54,540
I go,
listen,

1464
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,280
I tweeted,
I go,

1465
01:13:56,281 --> 01:14:01,281
I'm afraid to be early because this is a
weird empty industrial lot that I don't

1466
01:14:02,761 --> 01:14:06,930
want to be sitting out in front of cold
and waiting for you to show up and I

1467
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:08,880
don't want to be late because you don't
want to be late.

1468
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:09,870
So,
uh,

1469
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,190
but I wanted to eat.
So I told the uber

1470
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:12,820
driver,
oh,

1471
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,530
we're going to be early.
So just,

1472
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,200
we'll fInd some fast food.
I'll tip you extra.

1473
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,690
Does a fucking in and out burger on the
way up here.

1474
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,840
Well,
on the exit there's nothing but this

1475
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:27,841
fucking industrial area.
And this is my burger king.

1476
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:33,540
Burger king.
Burger king only exists where nothing

1477
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:36,790
else is available.
So you get off that exit.

1478
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:41,940
There's an industrial park or burger
king because burger king's next to

1479
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:45,000
anything else.
You wouldn't eat anything.

1480
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:48,040
A burger king's next mcdonald's,
you would go with mcdonald's.

1481
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,980
Absolutely.
You know why burger king was next to

1482
01:14:50,981 --> 01:14:53,740
payless shoes?
I'd go with shoes.

1483
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:59,060
I said that.
I'm surprised that every time I watch

1484
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:02,110
him naked and afraid they don't stumble
into a burger.

1485
01:15:02,111 --> 01:15:05,380
King was no other option.
Oh,

1486
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,830
oh,
fucking worst.

1487
01:15:08,831 --> 01:15:11,170
But I had to because there's nothing
else around.

1488
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:15,640
Mcdonald's broughT the fucking breakfast
menu to all day,

1489
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:20,290
but they didn't bring the mcgriddle
didn't bring the greatest creation.

1490
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:23,170
That pancake thing with sausage and
cheese.

1491
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:25,430
It's the gray one.
Creation they've ever made and what?

1492
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:28,030
You can't have it all day.
They have a limited breakfast menu.

1493
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:33,031
But today on newser,
mcdonald's soaring because they brought

1494
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:37,480
breakfast all day and if you know my
body of work,

1495
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:42,510
one of my biggest beefs ever is no
breakfast after 11 because as comics

1496
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,080
were not usually up before 11.
Yeah.

1497
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:49,900
And I like breakfast and it makes no
sense.

1498
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,610
I'm not going to do the bit.
The Point is that mcdonald's brought

1499
01:15:54,611 --> 01:15:55,660
breakfast all day.

1500
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,400
I love them.
Fucking sausage.

1501
01:15:57,401 --> 01:15:59,080
Burrito.
love her.

1502
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:02,040
That's a good one.
And thEy're fucking their numbers going

1503
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,300
through the roof.
I just can't take a risk because if,

1504
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:05,134
uh,
if I'm,

1505
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:06,710
if I'm hungry,
I,

1506
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,510
I look forward to egg muffins.
Yeah.

1507
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,070
So bad that I don't want to just a
regular egg mcmuffin.

1508
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:14,770
That's what I want to.
A little circular ham circular for no

1509
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:19,060
apparent reason.
Perfectly circular ham like as if that

1510
01:16:19,061 --> 01:16:24,061
even was it related to Breed the pigs
and cylinders say breed them and sewer

1511
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:26,550
tunnels.
They pack them in there,

1512
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,760
slice them thin.
I think that actually picker is.

1513
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:37,540
Oh,
but anyway,

1514
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:40,540
I'm addicted to those fucking things.
I love egg mcmuffin.

1515
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:43,030
I love them.
Like if I'm coming home when I'm hungry,

1516
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,750
I don't feel guilty about eating eggs
and english muffins.

1517
01:16:46,751 --> 01:16:49,720
It's pretty simple and straightforward,
but we'll put a process cheese,

1518
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:53,350
but whatever.
Some you also work out like a

1519
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:56,470
motherfucker.
I have friends in Alaska that would

1520
01:16:56,950 --> 01:17:00,110
party so hard that you.
Holly,

1521
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,570
how are you in such?
Well,

1522
01:17:01,571 --> 01:17:06,571
they partied that hard and then go to
the gym for three hours and lift really

1523
01:17:06,941 --> 01:17:08,860
hard.
I don't do the second part.

1524
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:10,000
Yeah,
that's going to

1525
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,090
be a problem.
He's going to with this crazy lifestyle.

1526
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:18,630
Everyone's been saying this for fucking
20 years ago is actually you'll.

1527
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,480
You'll always have this conversation
with me and we were like,

1528
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,550
how many surgeries do you have?
Yeah,

1529
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:26,960
when you're just talking today about the
fucking thing they did to your knee and

1530
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:29,330
putting plates and screws and drill and
shit.

1531
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:32,150
Morphine,
write code.

1532
01:17:32,151 --> 01:17:36,080
You had to go through that to get to
morphine and I can go straight to

1533
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,410
morphe.
Bad.

1534
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,370
Neat.
That was an early one.

1535
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:43,790
That was an early surgery.
I've got a gang of them sense things.

1536
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:44,624
Break,
man.

1537
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:48,800
They do want me to.
I got like three hernias work and I

1538
01:17:48,801 --> 01:17:51,020
don't lift anything.
If you get them fixed,

1539
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:53,510
it's so easy.
Eddie bravo got to have them fixed at

1540
01:17:53,511 --> 01:17:55,550
the same time.
They just stick these.

1541
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:59,960
They have this webbing they put
underneath the umbilical one fit because

1542
01:17:59,961 --> 01:18:03,650
you get it fixed,
but the other two I got the ventral.

1543
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:08,000
Where your abdominal.
What would be your six pack?

1544
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:11,660
And I had one that splits apart.
Not a problem,

1545
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,790
but the ventral.
Is that regular?

1546
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,150
The inguinal.
That's the groin hernia.

1547
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,430
That's the one.
One word is why I don't fix those

1548
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:24,770
catheter.
Oh,

1549
01:18:24,771 --> 01:18:26,690
they have to.
When you tickle him,

1550
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:32,330
which would have done,
if I coked up after being dumped,

1551
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:37,400
calling hookers and I'm getting a
dominatrix yes,

1552
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,610
but put it on a morphine drip,
one of those ones that I got a little

1553
01:18:40,611 --> 01:18:41,870
button with your thumb.
Click,

1554
01:18:41,871 --> 01:18:42,351
click,
click,

1555
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:42,951
click,
click.

1556
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:46,250
I'd rAther have a dominate your stupid
fucking solid and go.

1557
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,650
You're going to just take this fucking
catheter,

1558
01:18:48,651 --> 01:18:50,630
aren't you?
You seem so different than you,

1559
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:52,690
but I would like to do.
Oh,

1560
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:56,870
I can drink a bottle of nyquil and
listen to some david bowie get their

1561
01:18:57,170 --> 01:19:01,860
ground control to major tom.
Just let them do their thought.

1562
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:05,240
Their stuff doesn't even involve me.
I'm appearance base.

1563
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:07,910
I'm a parents' space.
I don't have time.

1564
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:11,840
Have time to think about that.
Catheter and catheter is not a part of

1565
01:19:11,841 --> 01:19:13,580
me.
How many surgeries have you had?

1566
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,160
Not that many.
Honestly.

1567
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,630
My nose.
Um,

1568
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,460
both my knees.
Your nose?

1569
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:24,650
Yeah.
I had a deviated septum and I also had a

1570
01:19:24,651 --> 01:19:29,651
bunch of blood that had pooled up inside
the walls of my nose and become

1571
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:33,920
calcified,
like a cauliflower ear,

1572
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:37,070
like a wrestler's area.
I had that in there too.

1573
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:41,450
They had a carve out some holes and they
had to do something called trim your

1574
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:44,120
turbinates.
Your turbinates are like,

1575
01:19:44,121 --> 01:19:46,720
I guess it's like these bumps inside
the,

1576
01:19:46,721 --> 01:19:48,980
uh,
the side of your nose and they clean

1577
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,190
those and flatten them down.
I broke my nose when I was five.

1578
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:55,250
I fell down a flight of stairs.
Even before martial arts smashed my

1579
01:19:55,251 --> 01:19:58,160
nose.
I remember crying and blood and snot and

1580
01:19:58,161 --> 01:20:00,200
my nose is always been crooked even
since then.

1581
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:02,820
And then from that time on,
I don't.

1582
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,990
Nobody ever says [inaudible] gorgeous
except for the nose,

1583
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,170
but it's been broken

1584
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:10,440
by four times,
but nothing compared to some people I

1585
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:10,831
know,
man.

1586
01:20:10,831 --> 01:20:13,560
I know dudes who've had dozens of nose
breaks,

1587
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:18,090
at least probably six or seven when I.
When you hear people bitching about

1588
01:20:18,091 --> 01:20:23,091
athletes making too much money,
they have a professional athlete.

1589
01:20:23,131 --> 01:20:27,690
Will have several surgeries in a season.
Could be.

1590
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,260
Yeah.
if your dad's getting a hernia surgery,

1591
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:35,360
you'll fly back from college because you
never know an anesthesia.

1592
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,220
Well,
and these guys just have surgery.

1593
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:41,880
That's the big argument for steroids
because the biggest argument for

1594
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:45,840
steroids,
steroids rapidly improve your ability to

1595
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:49,410
recover rapidly improved.
So if these guys get a surgery,

1596
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,870
like a kelly's tenant or some shit like
that,

1597
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:56,640
the difference between recovery when you
do steroids and recovery on the notch,

1598
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,660
fucking cheyenne difference.
I mean absolutely gigantic difference.

1599
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:03,510
They're not taking this stuff just for
performance.

1600
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,460
They're also taking this stuff for
recovery.

1601
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,270
It's in my opinion,
I mean done correctly.

1602
01:21:09,271 --> 01:21:11,490
Like you should allow all athletes to do
that.

1603
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,320
Whether it's martial artists,
whether it's anybody.

1604
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:16,740
The problem is like if you're talking
about like a knee surgery,

1605
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,820
the real problem is you can get gains
from that,

1606
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,490
that you will be permanent.
There's a certain percentage of those

1607
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:28,491
gains gains meaning you gained speed
explosiveness just from taking these

1608
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:32,250
steroids while your going through
rehabilitation because of surgery.

1609
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,760
So it is tricky.
It is tricky because that,

1610
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,480
that cheating,
whether it's playing football,

1611
01:21:36,481 --> 01:21:38,460
what have you,
that cheating will be permanent.

1612
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:41,760
Like you'll be a different person you
like literally will be more explosive.

1613
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:45,540
Maybe even like only fractionally.
So like maybe a half of one percent or

1614
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,040
something,
but it's measurable.

1615
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,440
You can measure the,
uh,

1616
01:21:48,441 --> 01:21:51,660
the tissues,
they can measure the amount of gains you

1617
01:21:51,661 --> 01:21:53,790
keep.
There's been some studies on it.

1618
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,420
So it's,
it's,

1619
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:58,890
it's tricky.
How much do you need as we near 50 years

1620
01:21:58,891 --> 01:22:01,230
old?
It's a hobby of mine.

1621
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,360
I enjoy it.
That's the problem.

1622
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:07,650
I enjoy training like it,
it helps me for me personally,

1623
01:22:07,651 --> 01:22:10,260
like we talked about like I do too many
things or I do a lot of different

1624
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:12,060
things.
One of the things that it seems like a

1625
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:17,061
half to do in order to stay even is that
I have to do a lot of physical activity.

1626
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,980
If I don't do a lot of physical
activity,

1627
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:23,820
whether it's like anything go,
I go hiking,

1628
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,620
I could workout,
I could do something,

1629
01:22:25,621 --> 01:22:28,830
but if I don't push my body and drained
some energy out,

1630
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:32,340
then I don't feel my best.
I don't feel,

1631
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:33,540
uh,
you know,

1632
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,670
uneven.
I don't feel relaxed enough.

1633
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,660
Like I have to drain the battery.
So for me like to keep my sanity and

1634
01:22:39,661 --> 01:22:42,420
perspective and clarity,
I have to drain the battery.

1635
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:46,140
That's why I do it.
The best way to do that.

1636
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:49,560
I thought you were gonna.
Say cocktails.

1637
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:56,430
Everybody's got their own way.
A problem is my way.

1638
01:22:56,431 --> 01:22:59,010
It's prejudiced against.
People are prejudiced against my way.

1639
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:04,520
My way is the way of the meathead.
You can always find someone who's,

1640
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,070
oh fuck.
He brought whiskey.

1641
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:08,590
I thought I should just bring whiskey.
Shit.

1642
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:13,390
Got a lot of Jack Daniels in bitch.
I been drinking jack and coke,

1643
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:18,391
but what I don't like is the koch koch
or red bull or anything like that feels

1644
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:22,870
worse than like if you.
I'd rather do methamphetamine,

1645
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:27,410
which is the worst drug ever.
I talked myself into putting the coconut

1646
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:30,310
so I don't feel like a deviant.
Just drink it straight.

1647
01:23:30,311 --> 01:23:32,980
Jack daniels.
That seems like something someone is a

1648
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,920
reckless.
Not if you drink it on the rocks and a

1649
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:39,560
proper rocks glass.
The nectar of the gods and they be

1650
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:44,700
tinkle the glass and the new snippet.
Isn't that one an entre cold?

1651
01:23:44,701 --> 01:23:46,960
It isn't that like part of a Jack
Daniels commercial.

1652
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:51,990
The nectar of the gods baby.
That was a you're thinking of and one of

1653
01:23:52,571 --> 01:23:57,130
the last to go know.
I think it was a commercial for jack.

1654
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:58,540
Daniel was there.
Yeah,

1655
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,340
pretty sure.
It was a commercial for Jack Daniels

1656
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:05,341
that featured sinatra talking about Jack
Daniels calling it the nectar of the

1657
01:24:05,471 --> 01:24:08,290
gods was during one of his shows in
vegas.

1658
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:10,030
The satins or something.
Well,

1659
01:24:10,031 --> 01:24:10,631
yeah.
You know,

1660
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:14,790
they had that rat pack era,
which is one of the most amazing times.

1661
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:16,010
let's say here.
We'll listen to it.

1662
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:17,290
Put your.
Put your headphones on real quick,

1663
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:22,010
and the mandatory at country doesn't
have to know is,

1664
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,530
is this the one where he does it?
His jet carried it to foreign lands.

1665
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:29,380
I can't get this whole fucking
commercial codes in the end.

1666
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,110
You gotta you gotta fucking try these in
advance on how.

1667
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:40,870
Either way.
The point is no one was tweeting.

1668
01:24:40,871 --> 01:24:43,660
Sinatra going don't die on us,
man.

1669
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:46,150
Any better.
Back then they didn't think you were

1670
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:46,871
going to die.
first of all,

1671
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:48,340
they thought cigarettes were made you
healthy,

1672
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,301
right?
That's back.

1673
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:51,000
When did you see the,
uh,

1674
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,060
you've seen the leonardo dicaprio movie
on

1675
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,930
wall street.
Now the one,

1676
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,170
the one where he played,
um,

1677
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:00,940
uh,
the fbi guy,

1678
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:03,010
j edgar hooverj,
dot edgar hoover,

1679
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:06,400
the j edgar hooverj,
dot edgar hoover's mom was like talking

1680
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:10,660
about him being sickly and how the
doctor had prescribed him cigarettes and

1681
01:25:10,661 --> 01:25:13,060
she'd be smoking cigarettes to become
more robust.

1682
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,210
Whoa.
Exactly.

1683
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:19,850
Always wrong.
don't back then they were fucking wrong.

1684
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:24,410
J edgar hoover sadly died when he was
with 35.

1685
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:27,140
No,
he lived a full fucking life to

1686
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,680
fortunately,
but still.

1687
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:34,630
Yeah.
So when you keep tweeting me don't die

1688
01:25:34,631 --> 01:25:39,010
on us.
I know a live a unhealthy lifestyle as

1689
01:25:39,011 --> 01:25:41,770
far as we know,
but I'm enjoying it.

1690
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:47,520
So until you're a fucking doctor who was
prescient better than the doctors who

1691
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:51,040
said j dot edgar hoover's mother,
she'd be more robust.

1692
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:53,160
Smoking cigarettes.
Well,

1693
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:57,040
you're a study in a way.
If I was a scientist or a doctor who's

1694
01:25:57,041 --> 01:26:00,110
trying to study people that are healthy
and happy and why I'm.

1695
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:01,900
I would study you because I'd be like,
well,

1696
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:04,940
here's this guy that's doing whatever
the fuck he wants to do.

1697
01:26:04,941 --> 01:26:06,110
Smoking.
He was drinking,

1698
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:10,610
but he appears relatively healthy in
comparison to a lot of other people that

1699
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:13,490
are not doing those things but are
working full time,

1700
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:16,580
solace,
thankless jobs,

1701
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:20,900
and they're the same age.
Like if I followed your happiness meter,

1702
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:24,410
like if there's a score card and it was
like a fucking college basketball game

1703
01:26:24,411 --> 01:26:29,411
and I could look at the happiness meter,
you'd be a dominating victory in the

1704
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:34,910
nine to five offer over the normal 47
year old doesn't have its downfalls.

1705
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:39,590
I wake up in sheer terror and I wake up.
Even when I'm home,

1706
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:41,660
I go,
I gotta get the fuck outta here and I go

1707
01:26:41,661 --> 01:26:46,390
right to delta.com and see what the next
flight and then I chill out and then I

1708
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:48,680
eased back in.
There's,

1709
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:50,870
there's downtimes to this.
I'm not saying,

1710
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,310
oh,
I'm happy all the time.

1711
01:26:52,311 --> 01:26:57,140
Being a drunk and a chain smoker,
but well we all are freaking.

1712
01:26:57,141 --> 01:27:00,320
I mean This is a.
This is like a core tenant of being a

1713
01:27:00,321 --> 01:27:02,720
human being.
If you're paying attention,

1714
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:06,350
you're freaking out about your
expiration date.

1715
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:11,600
You're freaking out about the fact that
this is a finite experience.

1716
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:15,110
It's going to end and we don't know when
and we don't know why and we're getting

1717
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:17,090
closer.
We're getting closer every day,

1718
01:27:17,091 --> 01:27:20,120
but you know what could have happened
when you were to have to a lot of people

1719
01:27:20,121 --> 01:27:20,954
at two.

1720
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:22,970
Could it happened in a car accident when
you were five?

1721
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,010
A lot of people in car accidents when
they're,

1722
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:30,130
but guys like you that make me feel like
shit about just sitting and watching

1723
01:27:30,681 --> 01:27:35,681
netflix for four straight days,
not getting up other than to piss or get

1724
01:27:37,551 --> 01:27:39,620
a snack,
but you enjoy that time.

1725
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,660
I do.
I wish I Could just go,

1726
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,860
hey,
I'm just me.

1727
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:46,490
Why can't I enjoy?
Why do I have to always think I see

1728
01:27:46,491 --> 01:27:50,000
someone who can dance and they go,
I'll never be able to dance.

1729
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:55,001
Why don'T why I don't excel at any of.
Rather than focusing on what I do,

1730
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:59,540
well,
I too much focus on what other people do

1731
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:03,350
that I can't.
That's where obsessive struggle comes

1732
01:28:03,351 --> 01:28:04,420
into play.
Doug.

1733
01:28:04,421 --> 01:28:06,040
Stan hope because it was tests have
struggle with.

1734
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:09,230
I'm really into when I.
Is that what you call fucking groping

1735
01:28:09,231 --> 01:28:09,770
men?

1736
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:10,470
No,
no.

1737
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:13,950
That's my obsessive struggle.
It.

1738
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:16,130
It'll fall in everything.
Everything.

1739
01:28:16,131 --> 01:28:19,700
I do groping men.
I shoot 100 hours a day.

1740
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:22,490
Archery,
like I just shoot at targets because I

1741
01:28:22,491 --> 01:28:23,660
love practicing.
It's fun.

1742
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,820
Okay.
That's a great example.

1743
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:29,930
If I shot 100 arrows a day,
I would be thinking,

1744
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:34,370
why am I not doing more with my life?
Like no matter what you do,

1745
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:39,371
I think I should be doing something.
Other people that I respect are doing

1746
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:41,210
what you do,
what you do,

1747
01:28:41,211 --> 01:28:43,850
and I just,
I can't get comfortable with just doing

1748
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,890
what I do.
No matter what it is.

1749
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:50,420
I see someone else who does something I
can't do and go work kid.

1750
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,890
Maybe this.
Maybe this will help.

1751
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,050
ThiS is an insight.
Here's one thing that's true.

1752
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:57,470
If I have things to do and I don't do
them and I go shoot those arrows,

1753
01:28:57,590 --> 01:29:00,710
then I feel like a fucking loser.
That's one weird thing.

1754
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,010
I can just see the

1755
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,190
fuck on shit.
Fucking bullseyes isn't.

1756
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:08,910
I still feel like a loser.
It's like that took me until I was in my

1757
01:29:08,911 --> 01:29:13,911
forties to realize that I can't have
anything like the price you pay for

1758
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:17,640
fucking off on something.
The price you pay in mental mortgage is

1759
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:19,350
never worth it.
It's just not worth it.

1760
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,950
If I have shit that I have to get done,
I have to get it done Because if I don't

1761
01:29:22,951 --> 01:29:24,640
get it done,
it's gonna fucking haunting me.

1762
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:29,070
but what is get it done and what is
within reason and that's what I had to

1763
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:33,540
like hit my forties far.
Realize there is a diminishing return.

1764
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:35,070
What is.
Well it's,

1765
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:37,080
it's,
it's like have to get done.

1766
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:38,860
Yeah,
you have to take care of your shit.

1767
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:39,790
But no,
but,

1768
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:43,140
but other shit like exercise.
Because if I don't exercise I do fucking

1769
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:46,350
freak out because of my body's just so
used to it.

1770
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:50,250
It's been doing it for so many years.
So if I don't do some form of rigorous

1771
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:51,300
exercise,
my body's like,

1772
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:53,100
come on bitch,
what are you gonna make us just sit

1773
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,370
around on the stand that.
But we all have different standards or

1774
01:29:56,410 --> 01:30:01,410
or or perceptions of what we have to do.
Where do you go,

1775
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:07,250
what do I really have to do?
I would consistently obsessively make

1776
01:30:07,771 --> 01:30:12,771
lists of shit I have to do and then I
would find one from a year,

1777
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:18,250
six months ago that I lost and made a
new list and I,

1778
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:23,320
I didn't have to do any of that shit.
I think I have to do shit.

1779
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:26,400
That's definitely true.
You definitely don't have to do

1780
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:28,260
anything.
You just have to survive,

1781
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:29,280
right?
Definitely.

1782
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:32,700
But if you want to try to achieve
something,

1783
01:30:32,701 --> 01:30:35,970
like if you want to try,
if you have a netflix special that

1784
01:30:35,971 --> 01:30:39,600
you're going to film in six months and
you decide I am going to piece together

1785
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:42,030
a perspective and I'm going to try to
get this material,

1786
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:45,090
I'm going to try to take it on the road,
but I'm going to need to have some life

1787
01:30:45,091 --> 01:30:45,690
experiences.

1788
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:49,230
So I'm going to need to go to the museum
of creationism.

1789
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:51,090
It's in Kentucky.
I'm going to go there.

1790
01:30:51,091 --> 01:30:53,550
I want to fucking sit down.
I'm talk to the people I'm going to.

1791
01:30:53,551 --> 01:30:55,080
I'm going to get us some information if
you,

1792
01:30:55,081 --> 01:30:57,780
if you have some shit that you Want to
do,

1793
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:00,900
then you have some shit that you need to
do in order to accomplish the thing that

1794
01:31:00,901 --> 01:31:02,400
you want to do.
That's real,

1795
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,640
but it's only on your choice,
but once that's when it's at its best

1796
01:31:05,641 --> 01:31:08,070
and that's the beautiful thing about
what you're doing,

1797
01:31:08,071 --> 01:31:11,190
what I'm been able to do and what it's a
matter of that are listening to this

1798
01:31:11,191 --> 01:31:14,700
that are self employed or they're
artists or that are trying to do that.

1799
01:31:14,701 --> 01:31:17,190
That's the ultimate goal is to do what
you're doing.

1800
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:22,220
It's decipher between what you have to
do for you versus what you think you

1801
01:31:24,241 --> 01:31:29,100
have to do for other people or to live
up to the fans or to whatever.

1802
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:32,520
What do,
what do I actually have to do versus

1803
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:37,110
what I think I'm supposed to do and
that's what I can't get rid of,

1804
01:31:37,111 --> 01:31:40,880
so I always think I'm supposed to do so
I have to.

1805
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:41,783
Well,
here's the key.

1806
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:44,880
Here's one key that I've found.
This is just my personal perspective.

1807
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:45,760
Kettle pay.
No,

1808
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,640
no,
no.

1809
01:31:47,641 --> 01:31:50,220
Don't get an assistant when you get an
assistant,

1810
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,050
you're just putting a bandaid on a
problem.

1811
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,570
The problem is your life has gotten too
complicated.

1812
01:31:54,571 --> 01:31:57,300
For one person I have now.
That's who said,

1813
01:31:57,301 --> 01:31:58,590
yeah,
you guys have a partnership.

1814
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:00,310
This is a completely different
experience.

1815
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,770
You know,
I don't have an assistant.

1816
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,890
I don't know.
Never.

1817
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:06,610
I won't do it.
That's my one.

1818
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,930
I won't have anybody who takes phone.
Makes phone calls where if you ever got

1819
01:32:10,931 --> 01:32:13,120
a phone call from someone,
hold for bud,

1820
01:32:13,121 --> 01:32:14,740
please.
I friend bud would do that.

1821
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:18,190
I would fucking.
I'd call his goddamn cell phone and this

1822
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:20,130
woman would go bud cell phone.
I'm like,

1823
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:24,280
but you're not that much of a big shot.
You fuck you goddamn cell phone.

1824
01:32:24,281 --> 01:32:25,930
It ain't that hard.
Guaranteed.

1825
01:32:25,931 --> 01:32:28,570
Tom cruise.
He answers his own fucking cell phone is

1826
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,420
a few people that just.
They have someone who does everything

1827
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,480
for them and they essentially,
they become like mommy and then it

1828
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:37,600
allows you to focus entirely on your
task at hand,

1829
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:41,740
which is to feed this machine.
You've created an employee's and fucking

1830
01:32:41,741 --> 01:32:45,130
hairdressers and there are all these
different people that follow you that

1831
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:46,870
you have to carry around with you and
you're like,

1832
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:50,500
you become like an ecosystem.
Don't do that.

1833
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,470
No assistance.
As soon as you need another person to

1834
01:32:53,471 --> 01:32:56,800
figure out fucking where you're going
and what you're doing and show you what

1835
01:32:56,801 --> 01:32:58,540
your calendar is,
you've fucked up.

1836
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:01,210
You got too crazy.
You stay.

1837
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:03,760
Stay low key because you're going to
absorb that assistance.

1838
01:33:03,761 --> 01:33:06,400
Problems too.
You can absorb that assistance.

1839
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:10,270
Fucking pill thing.
Fucking all sorts of issues.

1840
01:33:10,271 --> 01:33:12,280
Taxes,
they'd never paid their taxes.

1841
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:13,330
You're gonna.
You're gonna.

1842
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,890
Take those fuckers in,
man.

1843
01:33:14,891 --> 01:33:16,690
They're going to be like straight dogs.
You're gonna.

1844
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:21,620
Have real problems or a great friendship
and a wonderful relationship.

1845
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:24,430
Just got to be lucky.
So you said that was the first thing.

1846
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,090
I don't have any fucking assistance,
man.

1847
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:28,120
That's number one.
Don't do shit you don't want to do when

1848
01:33:28,121 --> 01:33:29,860
you don't have to do it anymore.
That's another one.

1849
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,660
A lot of times people get famous and
they get,

1850
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:34,720
they get successful and they get wealthy
and then they start thinking,

1851
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,390
I just got a full group is going,
we need to do movies,

1852
01:33:37,391 --> 01:33:38,350
man.
We're going to do.

1853
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,890
We're going to do our own truck.
You know what?

1854
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:46,590
Don't do that.
Go back to when you and I were 21.

1855
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:49,850
What you started when you were like 24.
I was 21,

1856
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:52,690
but essentially we're in our early
twenties.

1857
01:33:52,691 --> 01:33:56,200
What did we want to do?
We wanted to fucking make a living

1858
01:33:56,201 --> 01:33:59,980
telling jokes.
Ever sing karaoke,

1859
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:03,610
get postseason karaoke,
karaoke,

1860
01:34:03,611 --> 01:34:07,510
but comedy was a thing.
I could go up and sign on a list and

1861
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:09,850
then try to get.
Because that's the embryonic stage,

1862
01:34:09,851 --> 01:34:12,220
but once you became a full multicell
organism,

1863
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,940
when he became an actual like guys
trying to put together an act,

1864
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:20,860
what was the ultimate goal?
I just wanted to do it.

1865
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:22,960
I wanted to be able to do it.
Well.

1866
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,080
I wanted to be.
He didn't want to have a day job.

1867
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,340
Well,
yeah,

1868
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:28,870
you want to be a pro comic.
Right?

1869
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:32,740
That was a long time.
I spent three years of just going,

1870
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:37,920
I can't believe I'm driving to Montana,
18 hours to get free cheese cubes at a

1871
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,870
happy hour and 125 bucks.

1872
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,640
Exactly.
I it.

1873
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,130
Yeah.
I did a gig with this kid named scott

1874
01:34:45,131 --> 01:34:47,230
peppa.
Carry on a place called block island.

1875
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:52,150
We stayed in a fucking storage house
where they stored canned goods.

1876
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,640
They had cans.
Is an island you had to go to.

1877
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,800
The people were so drunk they were
barely.

1878
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,020
The audience is filmed.
There was no comedy to be had.

1879
01:35:00,021 --> 01:35:02,510
I never even got on stage.
They canceled the show.

1880
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:04,400
When he got on stage,
he got on stage.

1881
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:06,830
He told 10 minutes of jokes.
If we can cut the mic off.

1882
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:09,770
It was over.
It was a disastrous,

1883
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:14,240
horrific fucking set.
Heavy quantitative funds since probably

1884
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:15,320
not.
It was a good time.

1885
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,290
It was a good time.
He used to have another gig called the

1886
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:20,640
amount of points it in was a madam
[inaudible],

1887
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:22,630
Massachusetts.
It was just fucking.

1888
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:27,620
It was like a hotel and then downstairs
there was like this lobby that

1889
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:32,600
inexplicably had one of the best comedy
rooms in all of Massachusetts.

1890
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:35,130
It was amazing.
Guys like teddy bears,

1891
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:36,200
xuan,
lenny clarke.

1892
01:35:36,201 --> 01:35:38,330
They would headline down there,
don gavIn,

1893
01:35:38,331 --> 01:35:40,850
they would headline down there and I
worked there at gang of times with the

1894
01:35:40,851 --> 01:35:43,940
same dude.
So like I assumed that this gig was

1895
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:45,980
going to be like his other gig,
which was amazing,

1896
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,560
but it was a new gig,
so we got a boat.

1897
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:52,880
We took off some fucking stupid island
in the middle of nowhere where these

1898
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:55,220
people were just drinking himself to
death.

1899
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:58,310
His.
They were monsters.

1900
01:35:58,430 --> 01:36:00,980
They were just drunk,
bloated monsters.

1901
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:04,490
Who's this woman?
She looked like don burris with a dress

1902
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:09,610
and a giant red winston churchill like
gin almost got her up arrows guide last

1903
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:11,000
night,
but go ahead.

1904
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,710
She's wortH it.
She was just screaming at this guy who

1905
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:17,720
was on stage.
I'll never forget her.

1906
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:25,010
I glorified the early days when I was in
them too.

1907
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:30,230
I look back at some shit and go out.
It was probably worse,

1908
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:33,920
but most of the time I go,
I can't believe I'm doing this in the

1909
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:37,700
moment.
I like having so much fun fucking the

1910
01:36:37,701 --> 01:36:41,480
ugliest strippers in the world and just
happy.

1911
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:48,050
But that was before people had
expectations and as soon as I got what?

1912
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:51,800
Whatever the level of popular I am.
Yeah.

1913
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,940
There's a people who expect something
and like,

1914
01:36:55,941 --> 01:36:58,610
ah,
fuck god damn it.

1915
01:36:58,611 --> 01:37:03,320
I have to work.
Can't just go up onstage and eat a plate

1916
01:37:03,321 --> 01:37:05,810
of nachos and tell everyone to go fuck
themselves.

1917
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:11,480
They paid good money.
Now the transition has come full circle.

1918
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:15,040
You ocd because I just drank straight
off.

1919
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,360
My heartbeat is only on my dick.
That's the ocd.

1920
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:20,210
Is it?
What does that.

1921
01:37:20,211 --> 01:37:24,110
If I did a picture and phobic,
If I was to be letting dude sweat my

1922
01:37:24,111 --> 01:37:24,944
mouth,
eight

1923
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:31,040
susan sweater to my eyeballs,
I guess sweat and my ears.

1924
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:33,870
Oh,
it couldn't be hand sanitizer.

1925
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:37,360
Guy and wrestled dudes in [inaudible].
60 nine position.

1926
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:38,121
Well,
not only that,

1927
01:37:38,121 --> 01:37:42,500
but I'll do a 3000 seat show and I'll go
outside and take pictures of everybody

1928
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:43,820
shake.
I'll say,

1929
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:48,650
jesus,
I remember the time you brought me to a

1930
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,020
ufc in vegas.
The only time I've seen it live and you

1931
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:55,800
walked through the crowd

1932
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:00,390
as they're all lined up to get into this
monster agro fucking

1933
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:06,190
and just everyone's just glommed,
joel.

1934
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:09,750
We get a picture.
You can't get a picture with 3000

1935
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:12,240
fucking people that are in line.
yeah,

1936
01:38:12,241 --> 01:38:15,500
you can't do that,
but you just walked through like you're

1937
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:18,360
fucking moses part and sees a cat.
okay.

1938
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:22,860
I gotta go gotta go.
I have three people when I'm trying to

1939
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:24,240
rush out and I'm like,
god,

1940
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,090
I'm such a fucking dick.
Like I,

1941
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:30,390
I try to run out the back door like
hedberg used to do.

1942
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:35,570
Hedberg was legendary on a one nighter
with 100 people not asking for

1943
01:38:36,331 --> 01:38:40,530
autographs because he's not famous,
but he couldn't even deal with people

1944
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,510
tell,
giving him feedback.

1945
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:45,790
He just run out the back door.
It's,

1946
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:49,500
it's definitely an issue if you really
are worried about that.

1947
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,710
If you're thinking about feedback or if
you just were worried about interacting

1948
01:38:52,711 --> 01:38:55,530
with these people,
worth is is it's a weighted

1949
01:38:55,531 --> 01:38:57,000
conversation,
you know,

1950
01:38:57,001 --> 01:38:58,650
like they like you and you don't know
them,

1951
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:02,120
so it's weighted and the problem with
weighted conversations,

1952
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:07,130
the big one is that those can become
intoxicating and you could only want to

1953
01:39:07,201 --> 01:39:08,610
have a weighted conversation.

1954
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:12,780
You only want to have conversations with
people who adore you and you can't.

1955
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:14,790
Those are,
those are terrible choices.

1956
01:39:14,791 --> 01:39:17,460
Like that's a,
that's a reality that only exists for

1957
01:39:17,461 --> 01:39:20,370
very few people and it's not in our
code.

1958
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:23,820
We don't understand how to handle that.
Especially when it comes to you for no

1959
01:39:23,821 --> 01:39:25,950
reasons.
Like you're a child actor on a

1960
01:39:25,951 --> 01:39:27,990
television show and you've never known
anything else.

1961
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:31,350
You know,
like that's an impossible mathematical

1962
01:39:31,351 --> 01:39:34,290
equation to ask some little kid to grow
up in.

1963
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,430
You are going to grow up and you're
gonna have requirements on you that no

1964
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:41,250
human being is going to be able to as
rate with no one's gonna understand,

1965
01:39:41,251 --> 01:39:44,310
you're essentially a prince.
You know you're born and you're five

1966
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:46,350
years old.
You're on a tv show and the world

1967
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:48,210
screams whenever they see you on
televIsion.

1968
01:39:48,211 --> 01:39:49,044
It doesn't make any sense.

1969
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:52,290
I didn't see the movie,
but I get cut out of it.

1970
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:52,770
But,
uh,

1971
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:55,440
I saw a trailer,
the chris rock movie.

1972
01:39:55,441 --> 01:39:57,660
I take five,
take five.

1973
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:59,090
And uh,
he uh,

1974
01:39:59,110 --> 01:40:04,110
I believe in the trailer.
He says that's a problem with being a

1975
01:40:04,141 --> 01:40:08,040
celebrity is you can only complain to
other celebrities.

1976
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:13,100
Will there's loss using that level.
Like I think that's his line in that

1977
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:15,990
movie.
I didn't watch it because I got cut out

1978
01:40:15,991 --> 01:40:18,630
of it.
He's so famous we can't be friends with

1979
01:40:18,631 --> 01:40:21,120
him.
Do you know what I mean?

1980
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,010
like we're not famous enough to be
friends with.

1981
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:25,000
I say hi.
Go.

1982
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:25,913
Hey.
What's up dude?

1983
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,340
Get the fuck away from him.
He's too famous,

1984
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:33,300
you know,
like every time dave chappelle,

1985
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:36,040
I hang out.
I can't even believe we're talking like

1986
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:39,570
he was at my 30th surprise birthday
party really?

1987
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,880
Which was.
Where was that dave chappelle?

1988
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:46,920
Was it far fOllow or something?
He's the best I sweat date as before I

1989
01:40:47,011 --> 01:40:51,450
met you probably as dating christine.
We were third year 48,

1990
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:53,850
48 a before me.

1991
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,060
Okay.
You're older than me.

1992
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:58,240
You're old elderly man.
I'm your elder.

1993
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:02,710
I'm a march or february.
so if I come to the airport I expect you

1994
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:05,110
to be there for the sign.
Says elder elder,

1995
01:41:05,111 --> 01:41:10,111
rogan elder.
We'll make our own friars club and

1996
01:41:10,271 --> 01:41:13,510
you're going to have to get me in.
But if we were um,

1997
01:41:13,511 --> 01:41:17,710
we were both 30 and la at the same time
that you had to be in la because that

1998
01:41:17,711 --> 01:41:20,230
was 97.
Were you in la?

1999
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:20,950
In [inaudible]?
90 seven.

2000
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:21,783
Far follow?
Yeah.

2001
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:26,790
Christine hodge
was around then during the book when I

2002
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:31,420
met you because I met you when my mother
was on stage at the union.

2003
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:32,830
Yes.
And someone said,

2004
01:41:32,831 --> 01:41:35,740
joe rogan wants to meet you.
[inaudible] you heard you at the same

2005
01:41:35,741 --> 01:41:40,741
kind of comedy and my mother was onstage
and you came in and I try to drag you

2006
01:41:40,781 --> 01:41:42,280
out so you wouldn't have to see.

2007
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:46,750
That's the way I think joey diaz
might've been the instigator.

2008
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:49,440
I think joey dee is my nigga.
You got fuck with me.

2009
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:54,960
He's one of us is one of us is a fucking
soldier because when that was,

2010
01:41:55,211 --> 01:42:00,211
when diaz was trying to figure out how
to be dheas dheas between 96 and 98 was

2011
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:04,770
in his like hatching phase and then he
burst out of his egg and became joey d

2012
01:42:04,771 --> 01:42:08,590
as in [inaudible] 99 and I'll never met.
I'll never forget it because I take them

2013
01:42:08,591 --> 01:42:11,860
on the road with me and all of a sudden
I couldn't follow him like around

2014
01:42:11,861 --> 01:42:13,270
[inaudible] 98.
I couldn't follow him.

2015
01:42:13,271 --> 01:42:15,070
I was like,
follow that guy.

2016
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:16,900
Oh my god.
We were in west orange,

2017
01:42:16,901 --> 01:42:18,960
New Jersey.
The same place where the guy bought a

2018
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:21,760
for the comedian.
He bought a bunch of fucking nyquil

2019
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:23,480
bottles that I was talking about.
Yeah,

2020
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:24,493
same place.

2021
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:26,200
Uh,
I brought in joey and this is also the

2022
01:42:26,201 --> 01:42:29,800
same place where joey notoriously would
just,

2023
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:31,720
he was a wild man.
He just disappeared.

2024
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:34,390
Shit would go wrong or right.
You know,

2025
01:42:34,391 --> 01:42:37,610
he'd have a fucking,
a big bag of coke and some crazy girl

2026
01:42:37,611 --> 01:42:39,430
and it'd be holed up and he never make
it to a show.

2027
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:41,950
So I didn't want to not use joey
anymore,

2028
01:42:41,951 --> 01:42:44,110
so I started bringing ari on the road
with me,

2029
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:48,100
other guys in the room with me as well.
So joey didn't show up.

2030
01:42:48,101 --> 01:42:52,480
At least I had like one opening.
I got booked at a uncle funnies in

2031
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:55,780
davie,
Florida with otto and george because he

2032
01:42:55,781 --> 01:43:00,781
had such a reputation of not showing up
for shows because he was a crack addict.

2033
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:06,480
That's a build it as a triple x show.
So they would go headlong in case he

2034
01:43:06,761 --> 01:43:07,900
went on a crack binge.

2035
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:12,900
I could cover the time because we're
both of an ilk of triple x.

2036
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:15,820
You will be for.
You'd fit right in there.

2037
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:17,470
Well,
back then I could do.

2038
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:20,440
I was just all dick jokes.
It's triple x.

2039
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:25,560
I'm not on youporn.
I did a bunch of jersey shore gaze with

2040
01:43:26,081 --> 01:43:29,870
auto and george otto is awesome.
He's a who was such a,

2041
01:43:30,030 --> 01:43:35,030
like a weird soft spoken.
Almost like a guy who he looked like old

2042
01:43:36,371 --> 01:43:40,000
school,
like a vaudevillian times.

2043
01:43:40,001 --> 01:43:43,000
He had like this,
like affection for those days that we

2044
01:43:43,001 --> 01:43:46,780
used to do these prom shows and a danger
fields.

2045
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:50,770
And one of the things that shows what I
did,

2046
01:43:50,771 --> 01:43:51,900
I did,
and I'm

2047
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,590
sure your listeners know,
auto and george,

2048
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:56,810
you have to,
if you're a fan of comedy,

2049
01:43:56,930 --> 01:43:58,550
he's.
I'll go out and say this.

2050
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:00,740
He's the greatest puppet act of all
time,

2051
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:02,300
right?
He.

2052
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:05,300
Well,
he's the only puppet acted a comic would

2053
01:44:05,301 --> 01:44:06,700
appreciate.
Well this is.

2054
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:12,170
He stunk at ventriloquism.
His jokes were so awfully and he never

2055
01:44:12,171 --> 01:44:14,060
changed them.
And you never cared.

2056
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:16,370
My dad,
this is my favorite,

2057
01:44:16,371 --> 01:44:20,780
but don is such a whore.
Her pussy has a draw string,

2058
01:44:20,781 --> 01:44:25,781
like a laundry bag.
I watched him in Florida that time.

2059
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:31,700
He showed up.
He had some fucking class.

2060
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:35,240
He had a.
And I would go to him into doing it even

2061
01:44:35,241 --> 01:44:39,800
though those,
a partial audience that was black.

2062
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:44,630
Don't you hate black guys with tattoos?
You're doing a great impression by the

2063
01:44:44,631 --> 01:44:45,290
way.
I don't know.

2064
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:49,100
It sounds just like george.
Hey brother.

2065
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:53,240
Look at my deck to look up my dad too.
I can't see a tattoo.

2066
01:44:53,241 --> 01:44:57,030
You should've done it in white out.
You filthy circus ape.

2067
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:02,810
I've walked out of the room on that one
when there are black people in the odd.

2068
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:07,280
It's
filthy circus ape.

2069
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:10,880
He had some fucking relentlessly brutal
shows.

2070
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,280
That was the puppet talking for the
record.

2071
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:15,000
The pocket got stabbed.
Yeah.

2072
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:17,930
I heard a danger fields in New York.
Yeah.

2073
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:20,660
I always thought that was a a urban
legend,

2074
01:45:20,661 --> 01:45:22,910
but he confirmed.
He told me about it.

2075
01:45:22,911 --> 01:45:27,100
He told me his mouth to my ears.
He told me his fucking stabbed.

2076
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,560
He told me the one of the most fucked up
I've ever been and I only remember

2077
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:36,680
because there was coke involved and then
you remember,

2078
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:39,140
you remember?
Oh yeah.

2079
01:45:39,141 --> 01:45:43,730
It makes you alert and going,
I shouldn't be able to drink this much,

2080
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:49,550
but it was a alpha brain.
Me and ottawa and george.

2081
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:54,580
It was 2005 and montreal and it was me
and auto and george and Dylan Moran.

2082
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:56,450
Oh yeah.

2083
01:45:56,450 --> 01:46:00,830
In a fucking hotel room at the montreal
comedy feStival and I thought,

2084
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:06,460
I'm going to die.
I'm definitely going to die and the

2085
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:11,651
other people are going to die before me.
Jesus fucking Dylan Moran falling asleep

2086
01:46:12,981 --> 01:46:17,030
with a lit cigarette,
waiting for more cocktail to be brought

2087
01:46:17,031 --> 01:46:20,300
up to the room.
I was at the fucking gas station in

2088
01:46:20,301 --> 01:46:24,830
hollywood right next to the laugh
factory for the night driving home and I

2089
01:46:24,831 --> 01:46:27,560
never tried.
I tried to navigate gays and gentlemen,

2090
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:30,470
if you're ever near the laugh factory
and you need gas,

2091
01:46:30,471 --> 01:46:32,240
we're going to stop and do a commercial
break.

2092
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:33,590
Go to the.
Sorry.

2093
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:37,130
This fucking guy walks up to me and he's
cracked out of his head.

2094
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,720
there's something wrong,
something wrong.

2095
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:41,030
He's asking a bunch of weird fucking
questions.

2096
01:46:41,031 --> 01:46:43,430
he's real speedy and fuck.
And he's smoking.

2097
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:48,410
When I went to pump gas,
someone had done some fucking sneaky

2098
01:46:48,411 --> 01:46:50,120
trick where,
um,

2099
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,361
you know,
you press,

2100
01:46:51,361 --> 01:46:52,560
like,
what gauge do you want?

2101
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,090
You press the button,
you pull the thing out.

2102
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:59,450
They had left it already pulled back aNd
locked in place some spraying,

2103
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,830
spraying gasoline.
So I let it go.

2104
01:47:02,831 --> 01:47:04,380
I'm like,
what the fuck is this?

2105
01:47:04,830 --> 01:47:06,300
And I,
you know,

2106
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:08,810
I undo the little thing that keeps it on
and there.

2107
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:12,450
But there's gas all over the floor.
And then I started pumping gas in my car

2108
01:47:12,451 --> 01:47:14,310
and this guy walks up with a cigarette.
Oh no,

2109
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:18,300
he's got a cigarette just a few feet
from this gas on the ground.

2110
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:22,020
And if the guy decided just throw a
cigarette on the ground.

2111
01:47:22,021 --> 01:47:24,630
I mean,
we're literally depending upon the

2112
01:47:24,631 --> 01:47:29,631
choices of a fucking moron to not have
my car blow up me die.

2113
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:34,560
I'm literally thinking right now I might
have to sprint out of this position

2114
01:47:34,561 --> 01:47:37,120
because have you ever seen what happens
to people when they get in those,

2115
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:40,320
those like they say that you shouldn't
even have a cell phone out.

2116
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:43,020
IT's there's,
there's potential for a cell phone to

2117
01:47:43,021 --> 01:47:45,570
have a spark and that spark ignites the
fumes.

2118
01:47:45,571 --> 01:47:48,750
That fuel ignites the gas.
And people have died like that.

2119
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:50,790
It's very rare,
but it's one of those,

2120
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:54,570
the right amount of humidity in the air,
the right amount of static electricity.

2121
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:57,840
Weird shit can happen.
This fucking guY's just standing there

2122
01:47:57,841 --> 01:47:59,910
with a cigarette and he goes,
it's a nice car man.

2123
01:48:00,150 --> 01:48:02,880
Which get it.
I got it from a car store

2124
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:07,350
and then the guy in the fucking
loudspeakers going,

2125
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,600
sir,
will you step away from the pumps?

2126
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:14,190
You're smoking a cigarette while you're
while you're standing in the pumps.

2127
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:19,490
So this guY is angry now because they're
suggesting that he shouldn't be near the

2128
01:48:19,561 --> 01:48:22,770
pump.
So then he holds his hand up over where

2129
01:48:22,771 --> 01:48:26,250
the gases real touch and go,
man,

2130
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:29,580
it's real touch and go and I'm like,
I am not going to fucking burn to death

2131
01:48:29,581 --> 01:48:32,220
for some moron and I'm trying to figure
out what I'm going to do.

2132
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:33,660
like what am I doing?
Do what do I do?

2133
01:48:33,661 --> 01:48:36,570
Do I jump out of the way or do I just
charge at this guy?

2134
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,490
like there's one of two things.
Is gonna happen.

2135
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:41,220
Either I'm going to jump out of the way
and he's going to light this whole

2136
01:48:41,221 --> 01:48:44,790
fucking place on fire and I might get to
the road.

2137
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:49,940
I might get to laurel canyon before the
fucking gigantic explosion and all these

2138
01:48:50,221 --> 01:48:52,830
fucking houses go up in flames and
that's how it happens.

2139
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:56,730
One asshole,
one stupid fucking asshole looking at

2140
01:48:56,731 --> 01:48:58,650
me.
I didn't finger you when you were six.

2141
01:48:58,770 --> 01:49:01,410
I don't have any idea what happened to
you that got you to this position,

2142
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:05,220
but here you are fucked up on something
looking at me and you're holding a

2143
01:49:05,221 --> 01:49:09,630
cigarette over where the gasoline
spilled on the ground because the guy in

2144
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:14,220
the fucking speaker booth has chosen to
to pick on you.

2145
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:17,940
You got real weIrd man.
It's weird.

2146
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:20,670
When you said finger you when you were
six,

2147
01:49:20,671 --> 01:49:24,060
because you're obviously doing a black
guy.

2148
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:25,740
Not when you.
Some black guy.

2149
01:49:26,010 --> 01:49:27,750
oh,
well I thought it was a black.

2150
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:31,170
When you said finger you when you were
six,

2151
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:33,660
I thought you meant point you out of a
lineup.

2152
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:37,140
That's how racist I am.
There was something wrong with this

2153
01:49:37,141 --> 01:49:38,430
dude.
There was a bunch of.

2154
01:49:38,431 --> 01:49:39,840
It was probably a bunch of things wrong
with them.

2155
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,420
I think there's probably drugs and it's
probably something else.

2156
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:45,810
It was stupid and drugs together,
but there was definitely some drugs

2157
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,070
because when,
you know,

2158
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:47,980
when he was talking to me,

2159
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,060
it's just.
It was just like,

2160
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:52,420
there was a weird.
It was like a fucking scary dog.

2161
01:49:53,090 --> 01:49:55,630
A scary dog.
Like a dog that would just wasn't like,

2162
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:56,710
ah,
what's his fucking dog?

2163
01:49:56,711 --> 01:50:00,190
Get out of here.
I have irrational fears of things

2164
01:50:00,191 --> 01:50:02,380
blowing up,
including balloons.

2165
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:07,950
I left a perkins once because there was
a girl doing balloon animals on a sunday

2166
01:50:08,081 --> 01:50:12,490
morning for kids and just stuff popping
and blowing up.

2167
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,030
creeps me out.
I get past that,

2168
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,820
but it's just good.
Whereas camps,

2169
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,280
so they just wake you up to a fucking
bunch of balloons,

2170
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:25,250
blowing up the fucking gas tank.
Bb guns out on p cIgarettes is have

2171
01:50:25,251 --> 01:50:29,050
fucking sponsor.
I didn't quite turned down yet,

2172
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:34,051
but I told shaylee do research because
I've read like five or six stories about

2173
01:50:35,141 --> 01:50:40,141
people having e-cigarettes blow up and
shatter their entire fucking teeth and

2174
01:50:41,081 --> 01:50:45,040
jaw out.
There's one that's a guy got paralyzed.

2175
01:50:45,230 --> 01:50:48,350
It blew his fucking spine sideways.
Oh,

2176
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:51,320
you only have to read a couple of those
stories where you go,

2177
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:52,423
no,
no,

2178
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:55,690
I'll die of cancer.
One of the craziest ones.

2179
01:50:55,691 --> 01:50:59,230
I got front end.
They want to do an uber for babysitters.

2180
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:00,521
I'm like,
bitch,

2181
01:51:00,521 --> 01:51:03,910
are you out of your fucking mind?
you think you're going to just have like

2182
01:51:03,911 --> 01:51:04,520
a.
You go,

2183
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:07,000
oh,
do you someone wants my loved one.

2184
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:10,960
Someone watched my child who can't even
tell me what happened to him.

2185
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:12,760
Come on over.
Strange person.

2186
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:17,910
Why?
I've shown uber driver like an uber for

2187
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,060
like a database is really clear that
this has nothing to do with uber.

2188
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:27,250
This is like the concept that uber uses.
It's I need a driver.

2189
01:51:27,290 --> 01:51:29,440
Take me somewhere right now.
Right?

2190
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:31,420
Okay.
I need a babysitter to watch my kid

2191
01:51:31,421 --> 01:51:33,700
right now.
Get the fuck outta here.

2192
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,860
You gotta be out of your mind,
man.

2193
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:37,120
I was like,
they started describing it.

2194
01:51:37,121 --> 01:51:38,650
Tobacco.
No,

2195
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:41,500
no.
I'm not going to be a part of your

2196
01:51:41,501 --> 01:51:44,560
shitty decision making.
Like even if it works out a thousand

2197
01:51:44,561 --> 01:51:47,140
times.
How old were your kids were seven and

2198
01:51:47,141 --> 01:51:49,390
five.
The youngest one was crazy.

2199
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:54,630
Weird people,
which is like you're driving home from a

2200
01:51:56,921 --> 01:51:58,510
gig,
I'm assuming at the comedy store and you

2201
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:03,511
pull into that gas station here like the
doors in the background on the stone and

2202
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:06,840
it's the.
I find this.

2203
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:10,000
It's like the majestY of life.
Until that moment,

2204
01:52:10,001 --> 01:52:13,180
you didn't think your life was going to
be in peril that night.

2205
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,360
True.
You were just suddenly in that moment

2206
01:52:16,361 --> 01:52:17,770
just trying to get some gas.
Yeah.

2207
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:19,840
That's the random beat of life,
man.

2208
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:25,190
It's like that's what I do all the time.
I drive an hour and 45 minutes from

2209
01:52:25,481 --> 01:52:30,110
brisbane to the airport and every car
that comes past me the other way I.

2210
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:34,900
I wait in case they're drunk,
are they going to swerve into me?

2211
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:36,940
Douglas?
That's called being intelligent.

2212
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,540
I'm not afraid of death.
I just want to avoid it.

2213
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,460
Well,
you just don't want to die because an

2214
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:46,010
assholes doing fucking truck or math.
He decided to start

2215
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,400
beating off all over his fucking
steering wheel and he can't hold onto

2216
01:52:49,401 --> 01:52:53,660
the thing when he hits a possum and his
things all slippery like lube and he

2217
01:52:53,661 --> 01:52:58,000
fucking goes flying into your lane and
hit your 2013 suburban and turning it

2218
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:02,090
into hamburger time until I'm drinking
and then I don't give a fuck exactly

2219
01:53:02,091 --> 01:53:03,920
what.
That's why I drink is beautiful because

2220
01:53:03,921 --> 01:53:06,050
what drinking does is it limits
inhibitions.

2221
01:53:06,051 --> 01:53:08,150
That blows them away.
It takes them away.

2222
01:53:08,151 --> 01:53:10,120
It brings you to a place where you don't
care anymore.

2223
01:53:10,121 --> 01:53:12,200
You'Re like,
I can enjoy this moment.

2224
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:15,230
There's.
There's some fucking magic shit in that.

2225
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:19,250
The the whole key to whether it's
drinking or smoking weed or doing

2226
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:21,230
mushrooms are doing nothing or
exercising.

2227
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:25,310
It's like this harmonious balance.
Like there's a path.

2228
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,370
Yes,
you tweeted this.

2229
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:32,780
It's from your book.
Give a shit that strippers posts rampage

2230
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:34,550
alcohol cannot.

2231
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:36,860
Yeah.
This is from brian's book.

2232
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:40,760
Alcohol cannot cure every problem in
life,

2233
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:45,170
but if we removed the problems that it
can cure than the path is clear.

2234
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:47,930
Brilliant.
Thank you.

2235
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:51,410
Pass that Jack Daniels and a tale of
adventure.

2236
01:53:51,411 --> 01:53:55,940
My novel that's available on the amazon
is clear.

2237
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,010
Yeah,
that's true.

2238
01:53:57,011 --> 01:53:59,390
It's true.
I have a distrust for people that can't

2239
01:53:59,391 --> 01:54:00,650
drink.
Yes.

2240
01:54:00,940 --> 01:54:03,350
I'm not saying that drinking is the end
all be all,

2241
01:54:03,351 --> 01:54:06,830
but it's also an option and as soon as
it's not an option for people.

2242
01:54:06,831 --> 01:54:08,660
There's two.
There's two reasons why it's not an

2243
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:10,130
option.
It's either genetic,

2244
01:54:10,131 --> 01:54:13,460
which I completely understand because I
know people that just fucking have that

2245
01:54:13,461 --> 01:54:17,960
wacky gene they just had.
They turn it into a sharp eyed fucking.

2246
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,840
I've seen I.
I dated a girl once at the fucking

2247
01:54:20,841 --> 01:54:21,950
union,
by the way,

2248
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:24,920
at the union.
She was so nice.

2249
01:54:24,921 --> 01:54:25,490
I met her.

2250
01:54:25,490 --> 01:54:28,070
She was so sweet.
She was from out of town.

2251
01:54:28,190 --> 01:54:29,390
She was in.
She was like,

2252
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:31,260
she didn't have anything to do with show
business.

2253
01:54:31,261 --> 01:54:33,830
She was completely normal.
We went out one night,

2254
01:54:33,831 --> 01:54:35,240
we had a nice dinner together.
I'm like,

2255
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:36,920
wow,
I think this girl is going to be my

2256
01:54:36,921 --> 01:54:38,690
girlfriend.
I was convinced.

2257
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:40,550
I was like,
she's really cool.

2258
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:43,220
Like she's friendly and she's nice to
waiters,

2259
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:46,030
so all the things that I like,
she's kind week.

2260
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:49,160
The next day I go because there's a
comedy show.

2261
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,390
I mean maybe the next day,
next day or see or whatever.

2262
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:56,400
Whenever I see her again and she's
Fucking hammered before I get there and

2263
01:54:57,921 --> 01:55:01,130
she shark guide,
she's gone and she breaks a glass like

2264
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:04,190
this just like.
And she just starts talking shit about

2265
01:55:04,191 --> 01:55:04,730
something.
I'm like,

2266
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:05,660
oh,
oh,

2267
01:55:05,730 --> 01:55:08,260
oh,
oh well what a fucking won 18.

2268
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:10,920
We fuck really quick and then I'm going
to drop you off.

2269
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:15,020
She might as well have been a small,
hairy,

2270
01:55:15,021 --> 01:55:20,021
sweaty dude with shit smeared over him,
but will look like one of those fucking

2271
01:55:20,031 --> 01:55:23,790
things that those old plaster guys do.
When the the,

2272
01:55:23,791 --> 01:55:26,360
the wall papering,
she might've been covered in shit.

2273
01:55:26,361 --> 01:55:30,150
She,
she might as well have been under a

2274
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:33,920
peccary.
The whole thing was there's no way I was

2275
01:55:33,921 --> 01:55:35,050
gone.
Like my,

2276
01:55:35,110 --> 01:55:38,150
my survival instincts were like slamming
on the brakes.

2277
01:55:38,151 --> 01:55:39,890
I was like,
what the fuck,

2278
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:42,380
dude,
you came that close to this being your

2279
01:55:42,381 --> 01:55:45,420
girlfriend.
She's breaking glasses and looking at

2280
01:55:45,421 --> 01:55:46,920
you like a fucking zombie.
I'm like,

2281
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:51,120
jesus christ.
I went from one to the other one.

2282
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:52,200
One to like,
wow,

2283
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:53,610
what a.
Like a friendly,

2284
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:57,000
nice person.
That'll make me feel really good when

2285
01:55:57,001 --> 01:55:58,710
I'm around her.
We're going to have some fun together

2286
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,280
next time.
Shatter fucking.

2287
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:05,620
I'm taking her stabbing,
valets and the neck with a beer bottle

2288
01:56:05,621 --> 01:56:06,810
and falling face.

2289
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:11,100
First shipping on the curb.
Picture three years in.

2290
01:56:11,101 --> 01:56:16,050
one of those
was there for that,

2291
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,300
but at her best she was.
She was beautiful.

2292
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,460
She was an awesome person on the best.
That's,

2293
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:27,030
that's,
that's the most magical thing about

2294
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:29,160
people is that they're not like the
idea,

2295
01:56:29,161 --> 01:56:33,480
like this is why I hate when people
start to shame people or attack people

2296
01:56:33,481 --> 01:56:38,220
on twitter and go after people because
you cannot be defined by moments.

2297
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:42,540
You're defined by the culmination of
your life's experiences and your

2298
01:56:42,541 --> 01:56:46,620
interactions and as soon as you find
someone who's trying to,

2299
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:51,830
like I just label someone or lock
someone into one partIcular moment,

2300
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:58,170
you're finding someone who's just trying
to avoid all the flaws they have in

2301
01:56:58,171 --> 01:57:01,170
their self when no one's perfect,
none of us are.

2302
01:57:01,310 --> 01:57:03,930
And the,
the Idea that you can lock a quote down

2303
01:57:03,931 --> 01:57:07,770
and put it doug stand hope said that he
thinks that fucking,

2304
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:08,640
you know,
whatever.

2305
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,010
This guy should get aids because there's
jokes suck.

2306
01:57:11,210 --> 01:57:15,390
You know,
like if I was trying to describe Chad

2307
01:57:15,391 --> 01:57:16,640
shank,
oh yeah,

2308
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:21,680
the friend I'm staying with while I'm in
town and everything about them sounds

2309
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:27,170
Chad shank where he used to do this and
that bad things and he can't leave the

2310
01:57:27,931 --> 01:57:31,530
house because he's afraid he might hurt
someone really bad or murdered.

2311
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:33,030
Yeah.
You were telling me the other day.

2312
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:36,480
Yeah,
he's the most beautiful human being in

2313
01:57:36,481 --> 01:57:39,330
the world,
but to try to explain him based on his

2314
01:57:39,331 --> 01:57:44,331
own like biography exactly is fucking
fantastic.

2315
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,120
There's a lot of people like that.
There's a lot of people like that,

2316
01:57:48,121 --> 01:57:51,720
so he's going to be the king,
but he understands his own insanity and

2317
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:57,380
learns how to work around it and there's
this flashes of awesomeness to come out

2318
01:57:58,261 --> 01:57:59,910
of people like that,
you know,

2319
01:57:59,911 --> 01:58:03,810
there's flashes of awesomeness that come
out of unconventional thinkers,

2320
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:07,200
unconventional people or people that for
whatever reason,

2321
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:08,940
you know,
the pressure came from a different

2322
01:58:08,941 --> 01:58:12,450
direction and created some fucking weird
kind of like personality diamond,

2323
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:16,050
you know.
And That's diaz diaz is the epitome of

2324
01:58:16,051 --> 01:58:19,050
some weird personality diamond.
And I'm not even just talking to joey

2325
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:22,330
like nick diaz and nate diaz,
the mma fighters from the ufc.

2326
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:27,640
There's a lot of spanish people
start scarface.

2327
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,580
Fuck you.
Fuck Frank Diaz.

2328
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:30,473
Brothers.

2329
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:36,150
Yeah.
If you just read joey diaz is fucking

2330
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:37,470
rap sheet,
you go.

2331
01:58:37,471 --> 01:58:40,770
That's not a good rap sheet is not that
extensive.

2332
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:44,470
He got away with a lot more really.
Then he got in trouble for.

2333
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:47,950
The point is if you,
if you explained all the things that

2334
01:58:47,951 --> 01:58:52,750
joey diaz it wrong,
you'd never appreciate joey d exactly.

2335
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:54,700
Like if people in my community,
okay.

2336
01:58:54,701 --> 01:58:56,830
I live in a nice community of white
people with babies.

2337
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:59,230
If people in my community,
they said,

2338
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:00,220
well,
who's,

2339
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:02,290
what kind of people do you associate
with?

2340
01:59:02,291 --> 01:59:05,050
Well,
one of my best friends went to jail for

2341
01:59:05,051 --> 01:59:07,960
armed kidnapping.
There was a guy that had coke and he

2342
01:59:07,961 --> 01:59:11,020
wanted to get the coke from the guy,
so he tied him up and he threatened him

2343
01:59:11,021 --> 01:59:13,000
with a machine gun,
but he's pretty awesome.

2344
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:17,470
Fucking chris.
Christa,

2345
01:59:17,471 --> 01:59:19,630
I won't say her last name,
but christa,

2346
01:59:19,631 --> 01:59:22,740
like I'm like,
I'm staying at this guy's house.

2347
01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:23,680
I'm like,
sure.

2348
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:28,180
She just got out of prison.
So girl that went to prison for two

2349
01:59:28,181 --> 01:59:33,181
years because she had fucking a lot of
weed in her car and got busted in like a

2350
01:59:33,551 --> 01:59:37,060
weird county in Illinois.
You know those documentaries,

2351
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:40,720
they thrive on busting people.
Sure.

2352
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:43,570
Hey,
do you mind if I bring my ex felon

2353
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:45,510
friendly?
Is that a.

2354
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:47,800
Is it okay?
I know I'm staying at your house where

2355
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:49,310
people get scared.
What are you gonna do?

2356
01:59:49,311 --> 01:59:50,310
Are you going to.
Your friend's going to come over with

2357
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,270
going to steal my checkbook.
Douglas.

2358
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:54,070
Exactly.
Can you vouch for this,

2359
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:57,150
this girl or this joey diaz character?
Exactly.

2360
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:59,350
But the thing is like at least joey diaz
has.

2361
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,131
Well,
they both,

2362
02:00:00,131 --> 02:00:03,280
I'm sure have talents,
but joey diaz has a very marketable

2363
02:00:03,281 --> 02:00:05,350
talent.
Like he goes onstage and kills and you

2364
02:00:05,351 --> 02:00:08,620
forgive him for everything.
When Julie Diaz goes on stage and

2365
02:00:08,621 --> 02:00:10,930
crushes you go,
I don't care what he did,

2366
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:13,540
I don't care what he did.
Come on over.

2367
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:17,710
Come on,
let's party.

2368
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:19,010
That's,
I mean,

2369
02:00:19,010 --> 02:00:21,670
that is the reason why,
like in the late nineties,

2370
02:00:21,671 --> 02:00:25,750
I brought an extra eye opener.
It was only because of joey because I

2371
02:00:25,751 --> 02:00:30,751
just realized that that's what started
that conversation was joey diaz one time

2372
02:00:31,721 --> 02:00:36,721
the lake shore theater.
I booked him in the headline and uh,

2373
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:41,800
he just,
at the last minute hours before it calls

2374
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:45,880
up the book or it says I can get some
shit going on.

2375
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:47,150
He's like,
well,

2376
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:47,770
you're,
you're,

2377
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:48,291
you're,
you're,

2378
02:00:48,291 --> 02:00:50,800
you're,
you're going on in a few hours.

2379
02:00:50,801 --> 02:00:52,150
He goes,
shit happens.

2380
02:00:54,370 --> 02:00:59,080
My favorite idea store is I'm in jersey.
I'm working at rascals and this is.

2381
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:03,430
This is before I decided to start
bringing the second opening act and it's

2382
02:01:03,431 --> 02:01:05,800
the reason why first time he just
doesn't show up.

2383
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:08,290
He says he didn't know.
I didn't know.

2384
02:01:08,291 --> 02:01:13,291
I didn't know the god and talk to me.
I wasn't sure if it was real and then

2385
02:01:13,871 --> 02:01:16,150
the next night,
so they had to get some local guy.

2386
02:01:16,151 --> 02:01:18,130
Look.
Guy shows up like literally the show

2387
02:01:18,131 --> 02:01:20,620
starts 40 minutes late.
The whole thing's a disaster.

2388
02:01:20,830 --> 02:01:21,960
Look,
guy does well.

2389
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:23,780
We salvage the show,
right?

2390
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:27,550
Second night,
an hour before the show,

2391
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:29,920
I finally get a job.
He had a pager back then.

2392
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:33,520
If you lost that pager,
that was two years ago.

2393
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:39,230
The second night he called,
I get 'em on the phone and he goes,

2394
02:01:39,231 --> 02:01:40,310
I'm not gonna lie dog.

2395
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:44,350
I never left.
Vegas is a fucking hour before this

2396
02:01:44,351 --> 02:01:45,520
show.
It needs.

2397
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:50,480
He wasn't even New Jersey
and I had to make a decision.

2398
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:51,471
I'm like,
well,

2399
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:53,210
I'm definitely not going to not work
with them,

2400
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:56,300
so I need to get another opening act.
I need to give us more money.

2401
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:03,010
The problem with so many comics,
and I'd say 90 percent of my friends is

2402
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:08,600
there,
great comics when they're there and

2403
02:02:08,601 --> 02:02:11,540
they're on,
but they're fuck ups.

2404
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:16,070
We tried to do that tour.
The in bookable is like 10 years ago or

2405
02:02:16,071 --> 02:02:20,660
something.
That's the point is they're all funny,

2406
02:02:20,661 --> 02:02:22,580
but they're fuck ups.
oh,

2407
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:26,690
I'm 41 years old and how do you rent a
car?

2408
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:29,900
Lpa.
This is so fun.

2409
02:02:30,340 --> 02:02:31,610
Well,
this you can't,

2410
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:34,640
you can't like completely hold their
hand,

2411
02:02:34,641 --> 02:02:37,370
take them to the dance,
but once they're at the dance that you

2412
02:02:37,371 --> 02:02:38,720
can tell them where the good music is.

2413
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:42,230
Unless after the dance they start biting
people.

2414
02:02:42,260 --> 02:02:46,100
Yeah.
This is all sorts of levels of fucked up

2415
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:47,640
and you got to find that.
like you,

2416
02:02:47,641 --> 02:02:50,510
you and I both have a functional level
of fucked up.

2417
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,480
Like one of the things that you and I,
I think we,

2418
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:57,020
we like very early on,
I think we both realized we're fucked up

2419
02:02:57,021 --> 02:03:01,400
in very different ways,
but we're both channels were functional

2420
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:04,070
and we're both nice guys.
Like that'S one of the things like when

2421
02:03:04,071 --> 02:03:07,760
we worked with a man show were nice guy.
A lot of people forget that's the most

2422
02:03:07,761 --> 02:03:10,040
important part.
It's one of the most important things

2423
02:03:10,041 --> 02:03:15,041
you see fucking guys that you thought
didn't you retire when I started comedy

2424
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:19,490
while they're still working there
because they're nice guys and they're

2425
02:03:19,491 --> 02:03:21,890
friends with the owner even though they
suck.

2426
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:25,100
Yeah.
Nice guy actually gets you further than

2427
02:03:25,101 --> 02:03:26,450
it should get you it.

2428
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:27,920
Well,
It's also the,

2429
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:29,990
there's that,
but there's also,

2430
02:03:29,991 --> 02:03:33,590
it's the right thing to do because it
made you and I both remember when we

2431
02:03:33,591 --> 02:03:38,450
were scared and when we first started
and like I know that you are really good

2432
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:41,090
with young up and coming acts.
you're.

2433
02:03:41,091 --> 02:03:44,180
The reason I found out about brendan
walsh who I think is hilarious because I

2434
02:03:44,181 --> 02:03:48,410
saw you with him in la and that's how I
found out about them.

2435
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:50,270
And that's like,
to me,

2436
02:03:50,271 --> 02:03:52,190
there's this certain people like if joey
says,

2437
02:03:52,191 --> 02:03:53,690
this guy's funny,
he's funny,

2438
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:55,430
you know,
if already says someone's funny,

2439
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:56,820
they're funny.
If you say someone's,

2440
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:59,600
if you're taking brendan walsh on the
road with you,

2441
02:03:59,601 --> 02:04:01,730
I'm like,
well brendon walsh obviously must be.

2442
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,680
He's in,
he's in the group.

2443
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:04,660
You know what I mean?
He's,

2444
02:04:04,690 --> 02:04:06,620
he's in the network.
He said,

2445
02:04:06,621 --> 02:04:09,440
a lot of guys think because they're
funny,

2446
02:04:09,770 --> 02:04:13,970
you taking them under their wing is all
they ever have to do.

2447
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:15,050
And you go,
all right,

2448
02:04:15,051 --> 02:04:17,210
you haven't written a joke and four
years,

2449
02:04:17,211 --> 02:04:18,710
that's a problem.
Yet a fucking.

2450
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:21,560
I've had a few of those guys.
I had to cut them loose.

2451
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:26,510
But then there's guys like ari that I.
Hari is at an.

2452
02:04:26,570 --> 02:04:28,430
All the guys ever took on the road with
me.

2453
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:31,030
He listened more than any of them.
He would like you,

2454
02:04:31,031 --> 02:04:33,290
you would,
you would say something to him instead

2455
02:04:33,291 --> 02:04:35,900
of him getting upset and saying like,
yo,

2456
02:04:35,901 --> 02:04:37,650
but I could've done this.
He would go,

2457
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:38,580
oh

2458
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:40,350
yeah.
I keep seeing it.

2459
02:04:40,351 --> 02:04:42,930
Like one of the only guys like donkin
kinda too.

2460
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:45,090
But joey and I had a very different
relationship.

2461
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:46,640
Joey's,
my relationship with joe.

2462
02:04:46,641 --> 02:04:51,390
He has always been praise and love and
friendship and both ways.

2463
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:55,320
And he's just always been so funny.
Like ever since he figured it out,

2464
02:04:55,330 --> 02:04:56,041
I,
I don't,

2465
02:04:56,041 --> 02:04:57,680
I can't tell him what to do,
you know,

2466
02:04:57,710 --> 02:04:59,490
I just love them and give them hugs,
you know,

2467
02:04:59,491 --> 02:05:01,070
and he's kind of the same way with me.
We just.

2468
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:04,210
But ari,
when I met art,

2469
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:06,330
he was the fucking,
he was a door guy,

2470
02:05:06,331 --> 02:05:08,490
the store.
I started taking them on the road with

2471
02:05:08,491 --> 02:05:11,880
me and giving them money to do gigs.
Like the first time I took him as a,

2472
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:16,920
I think the first gig he ever did with
me was the comedy works in denver and

2473
02:05:16,921 --> 02:05:20,120
Mike Young,
she used to go on the road with me and

2474
02:05:20,130 --> 02:05:22,830
uh,
I called my guns back like the early

2475
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:24,770
days.
I had a flip phone and I called Mike

2476
02:05:24,770 --> 02:05:25,603
Young ago.
Mike young.

2477
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:28,860
I go because Mike Young had to cancel
for a wedding or something,

2478
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:30,810
you know?
And I called him uncle Mike Young,

2479
02:05:30,811 --> 02:05:32,340
you fucked up.
I go,

2480
02:05:32,341 --> 02:05:35,820
listen to shift fear killing.
I held the phone out the fucking

2481
02:05:35,850 --> 02:05:36,570
audience.
I go,

2482
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:41,570
you fucked up son and shit,
and I told laurie about it and he was

2483
02:05:43,021 --> 02:05:45,480
fucking crying,
but Mike Young was always there.

2484
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:47,580
He was.
The only reason why he was there was

2485
02:05:47,581 --> 02:05:49,920
because joe,
he couldn't come to denver because he

2486
02:05:49,921 --> 02:05:50,910
had a restraining order.

2487
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:58,160
Joey and his trading order with the club
that he literally could not go in the

2488
02:05:58,471 --> 02:06:01,530
club.
It wasn't a legally allowed to go in the

2489
02:06:01,531 --> 02:06:03,920
club.
He also wants to leave the state.

2490
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:05,520
No,
that was seattle.

2491
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:09,120
I couldn't take them to seattle.
I had to break new guys to seattle kits.

2492
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:14,240
He had some fucking domestic violence
charge or wasn't happened in.

2493
02:06:14,430 --> 02:06:16,710
Yes,
but it wasn't domestic violence in

2494
02:06:16,711 --> 02:06:18,780
seattle.
It was like something happened.

2495
02:06:18,850 --> 02:06:21,030
It wasn't domestic violence.
It was some,

2496
02:06:21,450 --> 02:06:26,400
some form of violence in seattle that
was unrelated to his machine gun

2497
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:29,280
kidnapping.
A drug dealer shot.

2498
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:33,990
Fucking take totally different crew at a
seattle crew,

2499
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:38,010
which consisted of duncan nri.
That's how doug had gotten the mix.

2500
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:44,540
Seattle duck is the best as he's great.
He drives a mercedes now.

2501
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:47,820
Oh,
he's got some crazy amg,

2502
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:52,320
but I'll ask it off the air,
but another thing,

2503
02:06:52,770 --> 02:06:53,370
another thing.

2504
02:06:53,370 --> 02:06:54,770
Oh,
have you used.

2505
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:58,980
Have you ever had to like read the riot
act to any support act?

2506
02:06:59,010 --> 02:07:01,350
Like have you ever had to discipline
someone?

2507
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:06,000
Not tell.
So fucking do that again in front of me.

2508
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:10,560
I know
you've been late three nights in a row.

2509
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:11,990
no.
Brian.

2510
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:17,140
Brian likes to find the worst thing when
we're in a green room at an improv and a

2511
02:07:17,851 --> 02:07:20,880
waitress comes back to bring us drinks.
Pre show.

2512
02:07:21,210 --> 02:07:25,260
Who is the worst comic you've ever had?
the same thing I always ask.

2513
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:26,070
Yeah,
there you go.

2514
02:07:26,070 --> 02:07:28,170
I always ask the guy who was driving to
the radio,

2515
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:31,380
the guy who drives you in the morning
obviously.

2516
02:07:31,381 --> 02:07:32,890
Who's the biggest dick?
Yeah,

2517
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:35,230
richard.
Jenny came up a lot.

2518
02:07:35,530 --> 02:07:37,300
Really,
even though,

2519
02:07:37,301 --> 02:07:40,120
like I said,
I was a huge time.

2520
02:07:40,121 --> 02:07:42,010
Who comes up the first?
Who?

2521
02:07:42,490 --> 02:07:44,130
Eddie griffin.
Well,

2522
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:46,810
he's crazy.
But again,

2523
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:50,970
eddie griffin,
you go back to eddie griffin on um,

2524
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:54,460
what was the fucking hbo def comedy jam?

2525
02:07:55,120 --> 02:08:00,120
Eddie griffin on def comedy jam.
He had shorts on and her rushed.

2526
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:04,360
He crushed to the point where I remember
watching him,

2527
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:09,730
he was on hbo and I was like barely an
opening act or maybe like some sort of a

2528
02:08:09,731 --> 02:08:12,460
halfassed for gazy middle act.
Right.

2529
02:08:12,820 --> 02:08:17,820
And I watched him on hbo and he fucking
destroyed and I remember being so sad

2530
02:08:18,910 --> 02:08:20,950
thinking I will never be as good as this
guy,

2531
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:22,900
that I don't have it in me.
There's nothing.

2532
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:27,520
He was bouncing around on stage and he
had power and expression.

2533
02:08:27,521 --> 02:08:32,250
He was skinny and wildly like some kind
of fucking jimminy cricket character hop

2534
02:08:32,251 --> 02:08:33,610
it on stage.
And he was,

2535
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:38,500
he had so much fucking performance,
like talent in him.

2536
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,090
I remember thinking,
man,

2537
02:08:40,091 --> 02:08:41,890
I will never be as funny as eddie
griffin.

2538
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:42,970
I'll never forget that

2539
02:08:43,190 --> 02:08:44,510
now.
Fuck.

2540
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:47,100
And I did a oh and a,
uh,

2541
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:48,390
when they were ona and a,

2542
02:08:48,490 --> 02:08:53,490
and dice came in because they were
scheduled at the same time and dice came

2543
02:08:53,921 --> 02:08:55,920
in and immediately

2544
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:59,650
lit up a cigarette and opie goes,
shit,

2545
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:03,390
a dice is going to smoke in the studio.
Like,

2546
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:05,320
like I cAn't tell,
you know?

2547
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:09,850
And there's no personalities like that
anymore in comedy.

2548
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:11,860
The kinisons,
the dices,

2549
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:14,050
there's no,
I'm overwhelming.

2550
02:09:14,051 --> 02:09:18,340
I'm a rock and roll star was impossible
to talk to.

2551
02:09:18,370 --> 02:09:21,390
He was a complete character,
which I,

2552
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:22,540
uh,
I love.

2553
02:09:22,690 --> 02:09:24,370
I love.
But I'll tell you this,

2554
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:29,520
the reason why you're not like that is
because you're better than him.

2555
02:09:30,770 --> 02:09:31,603
Well,
I know,

2556
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:39,190
but the same sensitivity to the moment
that makes you aware.

2557
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:42,250
I'm not saying I'm
next.

2558
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:46,880
I set it on rogan's podcast.
Better than what the fuck are you and

2559
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:49,610
ari,
I'm going to put you in a spaceship and

2560
02:09:49,611 --> 02:09:52,670
shoot you right to the fucking sun.
I need some more hate mail.

2561
02:09:52,671 --> 02:09:57,110
But the point is,
tell me one thing you guy that hasn't

2562
02:09:57,111 --> 02:09:58,740
said anything the whole night.
Jamie,

2563
02:09:58,820 --> 02:10:03,320
tell me one thing,
you know from hicks's boDy of work that

2564
02:10:03,321 --> 02:10:06,500
tells you anything personal about him.
There was,

2565
02:10:06,770 --> 02:10:10,350
he had opinions.
He didn't have enough time or you,

2566
02:10:10,550 --> 02:10:11,930
here's the date.
Anyone,

2567
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,150
um,
where did they live according to his

2568
02:10:14,151 --> 02:10:17,060
fucking body of work?
What was his day like?

2569
02:10:17,270 --> 02:10:20,600
What did he ever fucking do that maybe
I'm a human being.

2570
02:10:20,690 --> 02:10:24,800
He had opinions.
He could read a book and then make a

2571
02:10:24,801 --> 02:10:29,660
dick joke in the middle of it and then
make the point right.

2572
02:10:30,290 --> 02:10:32,960
I'm fucking better than him,
but I'm not as,

2573
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:34,400
as most comics

2574
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:37,480
working today,
but I'm better than fucking headaches.

2575
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:41,450
Well,
I didn't die at 32.

2576
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:44,960
He had a problem with cigarettes.
You apparently don't have a problem with

2577
02:10:44,961 --> 02:10:46,590
them.
Um,

2578
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:48,830
I'm way better at.
Cigarettes was a different.

2579
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:52,700
He was at a different age and they'll
breeze through my pancreas will.

2580
02:10:52,701 --> 02:10:56,390
If you go back,
you are rude and you're killing my

2581
02:10:56,391 --> 02:10:59,990
heroes.
But if you go back to lenny bruce's day,

2582
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:02,930
like if you go to my house,
I have lenny bruce posters.

2583
02:11:03,140 --> 02:11:07,220
I have in my where I have a pool table
in my house and above my pool table.

2584
02:11:07,221 --> 02:11:10,160
I've lenny bruce at the fillmore.
And then in my office where I write,

2585
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:12,890
I have this lenny bruce performance film
posters,

2586
02:11:12,930 --> 02:11:16,330
movie poster.
But I fucking listen to listen.

2587
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:21,940
Bill hicks winked at me in a giant your
in your house after I came out of the

2588
02:11:23,571 --> 02:11:27,260
only time I ever did dmt.
I swear to god,

2589
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:30,800
I came out of this thing going,
oh my goodness.

2590
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:32,870
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

2591
02:11:33,410 --> 02:11:37,970
And then I saw there's a bill hicks.
I have a cigarette with the american

2592
02:11:37,971 --> 02:11:39,050
flag.
Oh yeah.

2593
02:11:39,110 --> 02:11:42,170
It's in the pool room.
That's in the poolroom to whatever room

2594
02:11:42,171 --> 02:11:44,520
I was in when I went to go.

2595
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:51,280
I worried about you that night.
I thought I lost you because I got him.

2596
02:11:51,290 --> 02:11:56,290
He only dmt and we went fucking,
I think I gave him a way too big a dose

2597
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:01,910
because he was the first guy I've ever
met that foamed at the mouth.

2598
02:12:01,911 --> 02:12:04,130
Like,
legitimately he had bubbles.

2599
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:07,130
That's the poster I have in the pool as
the one where he worked at.

2600
02:12:07,131 --> 02:12:09,620
Yeah.
But he had bubbles coming out of the

2601
02:12:09,621 --> 02:12:12,550
corner of your mouth.
You're a moaning and you're going on.

2602
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:15,370
Um,

2603
02:12:15,370 --> 02:12:20,370
uh,
I knew my first cognizant thought was a

2604
02:12:20,590 --> 02:12:23,440
or memory is saying,
oh my goodness.

2605
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:25,540
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

2606
02:12:25,570 --> 02:12:28,270
Yeah.
Well that's what it'll do to you.

2607
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:31,450
That wasn't the improv night was.
No,

2608
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:32,220
no,
no.

2609
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:37,220
That was as.
We'd always a smart move.

2610
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:41,500
The dmt was a smart move.
We were doing the mancho when we came

2611
02:12:41,501 --> 02:12:45,490
over to my place to try to write and try
to storm ideas and come up with some new

2612
02:12:45,491 --> 02:12:49,510
sketches and just and then deal with the
hand that we'd been dealt because stan

2613
02:12:49,511 --> 02:12:50,530
hope and I,
we both,

2614
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:53,470
we had this,
I don't want to name any names,

2615
02:12:53,471 --> 02:12:58,471
but there's a bunch of people that sold
us an idea that we could go in and do

2616
02:12:58,631 --> 02:13:03,120
something chaotic executives,
executive teams.

2617
02:13:03,210 --> 02:13:06,610
They're fucking.
People wanted to get us attached.

2618
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:10,060
If we were attached,
they knew they had some names and they

2619
02:13:10,061 --> 02:13:11,830
could take that and they could resell
it,

2620
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:12,733
so that's what they did.

2621
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:16,330
But then once we were working,
once we asked on the set,

2622
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:21,600
they had very different ideas as to what
it would be versus what we had and our

2623
02:13:22,871 --> 02:13:26,800
ideas were based on the conversations
that we had that made us agree to do it

2624
02:13:26,801 --> 02:13:29,590
in the first place.
Whereas their ideas are based on the old

2625
02:13:29,591 --> 02:13:32,670
shows.
So there was a little manipulation,

2626
02:13:32,671 --> 02:13:34,600
but that's just part of what the fuck
happened.

2627
02:13:34,601 --> 02:13:38,640
So we would go back to my.
We went back to my place one night and I

2628
02:13:38,641 --> 02:13:43,560
don't remember whether we decided it was
the end where this was the end of this

2629
02:13:43,561 --> 02:13:48,420
show and we had to write these monologue
or whatever bullshit we were already

2630
02:13:48,421 --> 02:13:50,130
going through,
like such stupid shit.

2631
02:13:50,131 --> 02:13:55,110
Like we had this game show called.
It was called make me hard.

2632
02:13:55,140 --> 02:13:58,560
That sort of supposed to be called.
That's what doug's original name for it

2633
02:13:58,561 --> 02:13:59,394
was because it was your idea.

2634
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:01,770
Make me laugh.
Was a game show.

2635
02:14:01,890 --> 02:14:06,210
That was a where you get a contestant
and there's three comedians if you can

2636
02:14:06,211 --> 02:14:09,300
not laugh for how ever many minutes tell
him this.

2637
02:14:09,301 --> 02:14:14,301
I have to piss tell her I was waiting
for you to wrap up because I have to

2638
02:14:14,311 --> 02:14:15,210
piss.
Keep going.

2639
02:14:15,211 --> 02:14:19,740
Make me make me laugh.
Was a game show where a contestant had

2640
02:14:19,741 --> 02:14:22,350
to not laugh while three comedians
fucked with them.

2641
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:27,890
So we were doing a spoof called make me
hard where someone tried to not get a

2642
02:14:28,141 --> 02:14:33,141
boner during three acts and then we had
a midget fell eating a banana and then

2643
02:14:34,591 --> 02:14:37,560
we had a lap dancer.
Very hot.

2644
02:14:37,870 --> 02:14:41,130
Okay.
That pulls their dick out at the.

2645
02:14:42,150 --> 02:14:46,260
I see.
So and then the guy sitting there and

2646
02:14:46,261 --> 02:14:50,490
what we call the [inaudible] box that
measured whether or not he was getting

2647
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:52,980
erect.
That was controlled.

2648
02:14:53,010 --> 02:14:56,200
Of course
that was.

2649
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:56,970
Sorry,
forgive me.

2650
02:14:56,970 --> 02:15:01,620
Is this the concept or what happened
that the concept happened,

2651
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:06,630
but at the last minute sensors said,
you can't say,

2652
02:15:06,631 --> 02:15:11,250
make me hard.
Go with make me stiff.

2653
02:15:11,910 --> 02:15:12,740
What's.
Yeah.

2654
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:14,070
It was like,
wait,

2655
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:20,510
you're a transvestite.
Pull her cock out onstage,

2656
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:26,300
but you have to just make sure you're
employable enough by.

2657
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:28,370
I gotta make some change.
Oh,

2658
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:32,100
hard.
That's to adult oriented.

2659
02:15:32,101 --> 02:15:35,730
Stiff will go.
You can do stiff and at the last minute

2660
02:15:35,731 --> 02:15:40,731
all the fucking props people had to go
make a new sign is fucking ridiculous.

2661
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:43,820
Well,
they were crying.

2662
02:15:44,150 --> 02:15:47,780
They were crying like no names,
no names,

2663
02:15:47,781 --> 02:15:51,500
no genders crying.
Joey diaz was gonna introduce us.

2664
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:53,730
Okay.
Joey diaz was going to come and tell his

2665
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:57,440
kids he has timberlands on and a fucking
baseball hat on.

2666
02:15:57,620 --> 02:16:01,010
He's got a New York mets baseball hat on
and fucking timberland's.

2667
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:02,570
He comes out.
He's like,

2668
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:05,840
you ladies and gentlemen,
let's get this party started.

2669
02:16:06,050 --> 02:16:09,530
Welcome to the man show motherfuckers,
and they going to beat this out.

2670
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:11,510
This is what they tell doug and I,
they say,

2671
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:14,630
we're going to let you swear.
We'll beep it out.

2672
02:16:14,720 --> 02:16:17,030
We'll show nudity.
We'll blur it out.

2673
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:19,670
If you guys get sued,
it'll be great for the show.

2674
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:21,980
You know,
doug and I got together.

2675
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:23,300
We got drunk and go,
whoa,

2676
02:16:23,330 --> 02:16:24,440
what do you want?
Do You want to do this?

2677
02:16:24,441 --> 02:16:25,790
They want to do this.
You want to do this?

2678
02:16:25,850 --> 02:16:27,350
He goes,
let's fucking do this.

2679
02:16:27,530 --> 02:16:28,940
Let's fucking do the.
Let's do.

2680
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,520
We're going to do this.
We're going to make the crazy.

2681
02:16:31,450 --> 02:16:34,600
Once we got in,
it was a totally different story.

2682
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:38,290
Once the paperwork had been signed,
we were committed to this project.

2683
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:43,330
Then there was the executives,
the executives sort of had control over

2684
02:16:43,331 --> 02:16:46,900
the executive producer who had control
over the writer.

2685
02:16:46,901 --> 02:16:49,240
Everybody's keeping their job.
There's a bunch of things that doug and

2686
02:16:49,241 --> 02:16:53,980
I just didn't anticipate,
so we got to this position where we were

2687
02:16:53,981 --> 02:16:57,850
doing something that wasn't what we set
out to do and we didn't.

2688
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:00,130
Didn't feel good about it,
and then there was like a bunch of

2689
02:17:00,131 --> 02:17:02,860
arguments and one of them was how the
show would start.

2690
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:07,540
I want every sHow to start with joey
diaz naked running out to the audience

2691
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:10,050
and this woman was crying.
I shit.

2692
02:17:10,051 --> 02:17:11,100
Damn.
I set of gender.

2693
02:17:11,630 --> 02:17:13,000
Let's this executive.

2694
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:16,960
They don't know he friedman
pitch.

2695
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:20,980
Oh damn you stan.
Hope I love zoe.

2696
02:17:21,670 --> 02:17:25,950
She was crying.
Is this really what this man show a

2697
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:27,340
crying?
And I said,

2698
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:28,510
how about this?
I go,

2699
02:17:28,511 --> 02:17:31,630
we'll do it both ways.
We'll do it the regular way first and

2700
02:17:31,631 --> 02:17:33,520
the second take.
We'll do it with joey,

2701
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:37,480
which was a fucking set up.
I can't believe she agreed to that.

2702
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:42,400
That's so dumb because the second take
is always boring because everybody seen

2703
02:17:42,401 --> 02:17:44,200
the first take,
like it's a setup,

2704
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:46,650
but she didn't see a comment.
She was playing checkers.

2705
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:48,400
The whole fucking thing.
It was a setup.

2706
02:17:48,910 --> 02:17:50,500
We're doing a better.
Yes.

2707
02:17:50,550 --> 02:17:51,131
Yeah.
Yeah.

2708
02:17:51,131 --> 02:17:53,140
So joey comes out,
of course,

2709
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:55,090
roars.
Everyone stands up.

2710
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:57,900
Let's get this party started.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2711
02:17:57,910 --> 02:18:00,810
mark motherfucking man.
Show hope.

2712
02:18:02,470 --> 02:18:05,260
Everybody's standing up like this is the
greatest opening for a show ever.

2713
02:18:05,470 --> 02:18:07,570
So I look at them and I go told you.

2714
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:08,890
I know.
It's funny.

2715
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:11,410
It might not be funny to you,
but you don't have a dick.

2716
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:13,750
All right.
You're not a man because this whole idea

2717
02:18:13,751 --> 02:18:17,680
of this is supposed to be a major issue
already showed you earlier.

2718
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:22,860
A big fat fucking guy deck crew,
giant balls and an old ladies pantyhose.

2719
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:27,010
They were ridiculous as balls are
comical in their own.

2720
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:29,620
Look at him.
He does not look real.

2721
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:34,000
You'd have to sell me on joining.
He's one of the greatest human beings

2722
02:18:34,001 --> 02:18:35,500
ever.
Walked the face of the fire in the

2723
02:18:35,501 --> 02:18:36,161
background.
Yes.

2724
02:18:36,161 --> 02:18:37,330
Fuck yeah.
Austin,

2725
02:18:37,331 --> 02:18:38,740
Texas.
That's back.

2726
02:18:38,741 --> 02:18:40,360
Uh,
that place doesn't exist anymore.

2727
02:18:40,570 --> 02:18:42,880
That place.
I had a dude pounded on my door asking

2728
02:18:42,881 --> 02:18:46,410
me for someone named ed.
He was looking for crack.

2729
02:18:46,790 --> 02:18:49,720
It was like a crack house.
Yeah.

2730
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:50,800
Oh,
wait a minute.

2731
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:53,230
Nope.
I'm going to take that back.

2732
02:18:53,470 --> 02:18:55,090
That's actually austin,
Texas.

2733
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:56,980
That's not houston.
That's austin,

2734
02:18:56,981 --> 02:18:58,420
Texas.
It was Texas.

2735
02:18:58,630 --> 02:19:00,480
Now I'm regrouping.
That's in.

2736
02:19:00,510 --> 02:19:04,210
That's the place that's down the street
from cap city comedy club.

2737
02:19:05,230 --> 02:19:07,660
He's the best.
That's from a blog that I wrote called

2738
02:19:07,661 --> 02:19:10,000
happy pills because you still read a
blog.

2739
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:12,910
Not not much anymore.
I keep it in myself.

2740
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:14,890
I write them,
but they become material.

2741
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:19,570
What I found was that I was writing
blogs and then I was taking some of the

2742
02:19:19,571 --> 02:19:22,570
ideas out of those blogs.
That's what I was turning them into

2743
02:19:22,571 --> 02:19:25,180
bits,
but the problem was people would be

2744
02:19:25,181 --> 02:19:27,610
upset though.
Well then this is sucking.

2745
02:19:27,910 --> 02:19:30,020
I've saw that it was in your blog and
will go,

2746
02:19:30,021 --> 02:19:32,210
okay,
well I have to make a decision here.

2747
02:19:32,490 --> 02:19:36,350
Either I keep doing the blogs and the
bits are in the blogs and people don't

2748
02:19:36,351 --> 02:19:40,810
mind or people get annoying and they
start complaining that the genesis of

2749
02:19:40,811 --> 02:19:42,470
the bits occurred in the box.

2750
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:45,170
Guys,
it was two guys that said that and it

2751
02:19:45,171 --> 02:19:48,870
gets in your fucking head.
They don't know this,

2752
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:51,380
but you know better if you think it
through,

2753
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:53,690
but yeah,
initially two guys,

2754
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:57,800
I won't do two shows in a night because
I'm afraid someone will stick around for

2755
02:19:57,801 --> 02:20:02,240
the second show and go.
But it's a magic act will shit.

2756
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:03,110
Yeah,
they will.

2757
02:20:03,190 --> 02:20:05,600
They will.
That's why I don't do two shows a night.

2758
02:20:06,110 --> 02:20:06,950
Well,
you know,

2759
02:20:06,951 --> 02:20:08,330
I mean,
you could look at it that way,

2760
02:20:08,331 --> 02:20:09,470
you know.
Um,

2761
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:14,000
I've heard it said go take a post.
Did you piss on standing up?

2762
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:19,090
I've heard it said that maybe it's not
bad if someone goes to the first show

2763
02:20:19,730 --> 02:20:23,090
and the second show,
a few people in the audience actually

2764
02:20:23,091 --> 02:20:26,690
makes you think because those people
were there and you're aware of them.

2765
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:28,010
You have to do it fresh.

2766
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:30,650
You have to figure out a way to put a
new spin on it.

2767
02:20:30,651 --> 02:20:35,450
You have to figure out a way to present
it in a way that maybe it'll be exciting

2768
02:20:35,451 --> 02:20:38,420
for you and that way will be exciting
for them as well.

2769
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:41,480
So in a way where instead of just
pressing play,

2770
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:44,690
you say,
even though this is something that I've

2771
02:20:44,691 --> 02:20:48,740
said multiple times over the course of
the last x amount of months that I've

2772
02:20:48,741 --> 02:20:52,370
been working on it,
I'm going to say it in a new and

2773
02:20:52,371 --> 02:20:55,850
inspired way because I know these two
people from the first show going to be

2774
02:20:55,851 --> 02:20:56,720
here at the second show.

2775
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:04,570
He wOn't tell me if there's people that
have stayed over town because he gets

2776
02:21:04,990 --> 02:21:06,260
old party.
No,

2777
02:21:06,261 --> 02:21:08,210
no.
I get my head.

2778
02:21:08,211 --> 02:21:11,300
I'll try to do completely different
material.

2779
02:21:11,301 --> 02:21:13,820
That's not even materials to care for
us.

2780
02:21:13,860 --> 02:21:15,830
Yes.
Because two fucking people.

2781
02:21:16,010 --> 02:21:16,790
I go,
I,

2782
02:21:16,790 --> 02:21:19,360
I've,
I've shows the awkward people their

2783
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:20,660
money back going,
hey,

2784
02:21:20,661 --> 02:21:23,390
I saw you in manchester.
I'm going to come see him leads

2785
02:21:23,391 --> 02:21:25,630
tomorrow.
I'll give you your money back right now.

2786
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:28,430
Don't do that to me.
I told this dude and manchester,

2787
02:21:28,670 --> 02:21:29,830
if you're going to come.
He said,

2788
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:32,000
I'm coming to two shows.
I go,

2789
02:21:32,001 --> 02:21:33,890
you got to get really fucked up.
The first show.

2790
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:38,420
The second show is novel.
You can't come to think about my

2791
02:21:38,421 --> 02:21:41,600
audience is most of them are drunks.
And they don't remember.

2792
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:44,090
I get emails all the time,
hey,

2793
02:21:44,091 --> 02:21:47,120
I hope that thing that specialists
coming up,

2794
02:21:47,121 --> 02:21:50,410
because I don't remember I was there,
but I don't remember a thing from it.

2795
02:21:50,780 --> 02:21:52,940
Well,
I think that potheads and alcoholics,

2796
02:21:52,941 --> 02:21:57,000
shane share that the lack of memory,
and it's this,

2797
02:21:57,230 --> 02:21:59,600
this,
this is what's beautiful about alcohol

2798
02:21:59,601 --> 02:22:04,190
as well as beautiful about pot is this
desire to somehow or another embrace

2799
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:07,520
this moment.
And with pot it's always the fear of

2800
02:22:07,521 --> 02:22:12,521
getting carried away by the new found
ideas of what reality really is.

2801
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:19,070
Whereas with alcohol,
it's the ignorance of those ideas.

2802
02:22:19,071 --> 02:22:21,650
The point like,
who fucking cares?

2803
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:26,280
Who cares what we do in shots,
who've going to Mexico,

2804
02:22:27,070 --> 02:22:29,550
you know,
that's where it comes in with alcohol.

2805
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:30,960
Whereas his weed,
you know,

2806
02:22:30,961 --> 02:22:32,820
you're like,
I know how to get to the roof.

2807
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:35,370
Let's go man.
It's just like,

2808
02:22:35,371 --> 02:22:38,400
it's so weird to think that there's just
a few hundred miles.

2809
02:22:38,401 --> 02:22:42,330
There's fucking gas and like what does
it magnets or something like,

2810
02:22:42,331 --> 02:22:43,920
what's the magnetosphere?
I don't know,

2811
02:22:43,921 --> 02:22:45,270
man.
Let me get my phone.

2812
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:48,300
And you're trying to figure out why the
earth.

2813
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:51,210
It doesn't just absorb radiation from
the sun somehow or another.

2814
02:22:51,211 --> 02:22:53,910
It's been designed so there's like the
seal.

2815
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:56,580
It's like circular shit that you don't
understand.

2816
02:22:56,760 --> 02:23:01,260
The magnetos fear and the honest fear.
It's all fucking filtering gamma

2817
02:23:01,261 --> 02:23:05,400
radiation.
That becomes your freak out instead of

2818
02:23:05,401 --> 02:23:09,180
the alcoholic freak out,
which is just a number.

2819
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:11,710
Your jack and then I gotta get the fuck
outta here.

2820
02:23:12,110 --> 02:23:17,110
I know what we're not going anywhere.
I fucking on uber.

2821
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:19,170
Yeah,
drunk uber.

2822
02:23:20,140 --> 02:23:25,140
I think that it would get a newborn vrs.
That's where I'm going.

2823
02:23:25,351 --> 02:23:27,750
I don't know what it means.
This means you're going to do some

2824
02:23:27,751 --> 02:23:29,720
hollywood type share with sound.
What?

2825
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:30,441
What?
Whoa.

2826
02:23:30,441 --> 02:23:31,274
Whoa,
whoa.

2827
02:23:31,770 --> 02:23:35,010
What have been the adr multiple times?
What does it mean?

2828
02:23:35,011 --> 02:23:38,820
What's during the fear factor days?
It was the worst parts about the job.

2829
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:41,190
Here's a fuckIng cold,
hard,

2830
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:45,030
ugly fact about fear factor.
If you watch it on tv,

2831
02:23:45,031 --> 02:23:49,260
especially on a chiller network where
still place like 12 hours a day,

2832
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:54,420
if you have done is on all day long.
Not that it's bad thing,

2833
02:23:54,870 --> 02:23:56,610
good thing,
but if you watch it,

2834
02:23:56,611 --> 02:23:59,280
a lot of the times when I'm talking,
I'm not really there.

2835
02:23:59,550 --> 02:24:04,550
I'm talking in a sound booth somewhere
where I had to watch the replay and like

2836
02:24:06,330 --> 02:24:10,320
maybe some shit didn't come across right
because the sound was all fucked up or

2837
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:15,440
sound cut out or something like that.
If you ever watch bar rescue or any dumb

2838
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:21,300
shit reality show you're into,
if they're not showing john taffer

2839
02:24:21,301 --> 02:24:24,000
saying,
well get the hell out of my bar.

2840
02:24:24,001 --> 02:24:26,880
They're Showing the back of his head.
He never said that.

2841
02:24:26,910 --> 02:24:31,770
He said after the fact.
Is that what adr is exactly what I want

2842
02:24:31,771 --> 02:24:34,890
to know what it stands for,
like especially on a reality show

2843
02:24:36,010 --> 02:24:39,420
dialogue recording,
but jamie's actually an audio engineer

2844
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:40,630
automated dialogue.

2845
02:24:40,660 --> 02:24:41,493
Oh,
there you go.

2846
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:42,810
There you go,
bitch.

2847
02:24:43,410 --> 02:24:44,900
Brian,
hold guess close to.

2848
02:24:44,930 --> 02:24:46,740
I was wrong.
Shut up.

2849
02:24:46,980 --> 02:24:51,340
Why is this guy always interrupting?
Why is he like red band always

2850
02:24:51,450 --> 02:24:54,210
interrupted with the fuck this guy get a
mellow yellow t shirt.

2851
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:57,090
How dare you?
I bought online.

2852
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:58,800
I don't even know what it was when I
bought it.

2853
02:24:58,890 --> 02:25:00,570
Really,
I just thought it was a nice phrase.

2854
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:03,660
Well,
it was a song and it was a drink.

2855
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:05,370
Well,
remember the total number,

2856
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:07,540
that donovan song,
but I didn't know.

2857
02:25:07,940 --> 02:25:10,700
I didn't know as a drink.
Yeah,

2858
02:25:10,710 --> 02:25:12,300
it was a drink,
like a,

2859
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:16,950
like a really shitty mountain dew,
like a mountain dew for people.

2860
02:25:16,951 --> 02:25:19,070
Couldn't find mountain that you're
taking.

2861
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:23,040
That's what I'm saying.
A lot of shitty mountain jew shit faced

2862
02:25:23,790 --> 02:25:23,980
were

2863
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,200
hammered.
Um.

2864
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:26,620
Is that.
Yeah,

2865
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:27,820
definitely.
You're right.

2866
02:25:27,850 --> 02:25:30,610
I hope I'm going to get one of those.
I'm going to call one.

2867
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:33,530
Ooh,
come in quite.

2868
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:35,110
That was the song that,
uh,

2869
02:25:35,540 --> 02:25:38,130
at bob dylan beat them down with bob
dylan.

2870
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:39,610
Did some.
There's,

2871
02:25:39,740 --> 02:25:44,740
there's a film of him like parodying a
donovan on stage in london.

2872
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:48,460
It's inevitable.
There's venus even amongst amazing

2873
02:25:48,461 --> 02:25:49,600
musicians.
yeah.

2874
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:51,220
That's a good song.
That song.

2875
02:25:52,270 --> 02:25:53,500
How dare you.
Bob dylan.

2876
02:25:54,490 --> 02:25:56,770
Bob dylan.
But he's going nowhere.

2877
02:25:56,830 --> 02:25:59,500
He wrote all along the watchtower.
He did.

2878
02:25:59,830 --> 02:26:00,970
God damn.
That was good.

2879
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:04,750
That was one of the few songs where I
appreciated equally,

2880
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:08,120
whether it's dylan or hendrix,
you know,

2881
02:26:08,470 --> 02:26:11,500
either one of them is good.
They've got their own weird little

2882
02:26:11,830 --> 02:26:13,540
little bend on it.
You know,

2883
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:16,390
you don't even give a fuck about music,
do you?

2884
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:18,550
he's knocked down tight.
You like,

2885
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:19,840
look,
if you talk about football,

2886
02:26:19,841 --> 02:26:21,940
that's the same way I feel.
I.

2887
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:25,330
I don't even give a Shit about football.
Worst superbowl,

2888
02:26:25,390 --> 02:26:29,710
fucking whatever.
You have said some outrageous things

2889
02:26:29,711 --> 02:26:30,910
during this podcast.
Doug.

2890
02:26:30,911 --> 02:26:31,690
Stan.
Whoa.

2891
02:26:31,690 --> 02:26:36,690
This is fucking denver against carolina
stinks.

2892
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:39,670
Why?
Why does it stink?

2893
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:44,700
No one cares about those teams forms and
no one hears todd.

2894
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:49,630
I like peyton manning.
He does funny commercials.

2895
02:26:49,980 --> 02:26:54,980
You've got the two most almost can
actually do funny and that's what I love

2896
02:26:55,001 --> 02:26:55,721
about him.
Well,

2897
02:26:55,721 --> 02:26:59,800
him and tom brady seemed to be designed
to make the perfect person.

2898
02:27:00,070 --> 02:27:02,150
If they could just get together.
Girl,

2899
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:07,000
there's two sperm lassoed together,
like one of those high school ropes.

2900
02:27:07,001 --> 02:27:10,890
We have to climb in the gym.
If the two sperm intersect the egg and

2901
02:27:10,891 --> 02:27:12,450
the exact same time and create a super

2902
02:27:12,490 --> 02:27:16,510
personally time,
an athlete can actually pull off even a

2903
02:27:16,511 --> 02:27:18,910
little bit of funny where you didn't
expect it.

2904
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:23,440
It's hilarious.
George foreman was hilarious when he was

2905
02:27:23,441 --> 02:27:26,800
making his comeback.
Fight a man,

2906
02:27:26,801 --> 02:27:31,801
unless he's in bed on a respirator,
I make sure they're off their respirator

2907
02:27:32,350 --> 02:27:34,510
for at least eight days before I'll
fight him.

2908
02:27:34,511 --> 02:27:38,320
That's a quote from George Foreman.
He was hilarious during his comeback.

2909
02:27:38,350 --> 02:27:42,820
IT was so when comedy is unexpected,
it's the best.

2910
02:27:42,870 --> 02:27:45,670
Yeah.
Well george former been at a bar where

2911
02:27:45,671 --> 02:27:47,680
you're saying some funny shit and they
go,

2912
02:27:47,681 --> 02:27:52,000
what do you do for a living?
After everyone had an unknown bar likes

2913
02:27:52,001 --> 02:27:54,460
you and then you go,
I'm a standup comedian,

2914
02:27:54,461 --> 02:27:55,870
and they go,
oh,

2915
02:27:56,950 --> 02:28:01,950
now they're judging everything you say.
If you've had that before.

2916
02:28:02,320 --> 02:28:03,430
Yeah,
I drink it.

2917
02:28:03,431 --> 02:28:06,410
A lot of unknown bars and you just start
like,

2918
02:28:06,710 --> 02:28:09,490
well,
here's my stories.

2919
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:14,200
One of my favorite doug stories is with
fucking boxing match and vegas,

2920
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:17,930
and you were a heckling and hold them

2921
02:28:17,970 --> 02:28:22,200
down and fuck his face.
It'll destroy confidence.

2922
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:25,520
This is the.
This is the prelims.

2923
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:29,390
This box listening audience.
You have to understand when you go to

2924
02:28:29,391 --> 02:28:34,391
whatever his boxing or ufc,
the undercard no one's there.

2925
02:28:34,401 --> 02:28:37,880
They're all out getting drinks and
waiting for the thing that they don't

2926
02:28:37,881 --> 02:28:40,190
understand to happen.
That's at the end.

2927
02:28:40,850 --> 02:28:45,410
So it's dead silent.
Bingo hall church.

2928
02:28:45,411 --> 02:28:50,240
Silence.
So you can heckle and froM the back row.

2929
02:28:50,241 --> 02:28:55,241
But joe rogan good a second row,
so it's absolutely quiet and we're in

2930
02:28:56,181 --> 02:29:00,440
their heckling.
Let me take your fucking him in the ass.

2931
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:00,750
no,
no,

2932
02:29:00,750 --> 02:29:02,450
no.
Let's take it from because I wasn't

2933
02:29:02,451 --> 02:29:05,750
heckling at all because douglas doesn't
do marijuana.

2934
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:09,230
Joseph does marijuana.
Douglas does alcohol.

2935
02:29:09,470 --> 02:29:13,400
Joseph does marijuana.
Joseph's freaking out because douglas is

2936
02:29:13,401 --> 02:29:16,400
heckling him on your ticket and I'm
fucking laugh.

2937
02:29:16,480 --> 02:29:19,970
You're the one who brought me in and so
I'm kind of your responsibility.

2938
02:29:20,070 --> 02:29:22,460
Yeah,
try making him come.

2939
02:29:22,461 --> 02:29:27,461
That always knocks me out like a light.
Wait till two seconds to go and say you

2940
02:29:29,091 --> 02:29:34,091
just got punked.
I don't remember that one was.

2941
02:29:35,370 --> 02:29:39,170
There was a five fights in a row with no
one in the arena.

2942
02:29:39,410 --> 02:29:43,540
The boxers could hear you.
Well,

2943
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:44,040
no,
no,

2944
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:46,940
no.
He's being too humble here.

2945
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:50,450
He got.
He started getting laughs and that

2946
02:29:50,451 --> 02:29:53,380
became a problem.
Became a problem.

2947
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:58,370
It was wonderful.
I think it was holding down and fuck his

2948
02:29:58,371 --> 02:30:00,110
face.
That was the one that broke to

2949
02:30:00,111 --> 02:30:00,944
waterfall.

2950
02:30:05,140 --> 02:30:06,530
Breakfast.
Confidence.

2951
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:09,710
Let me say something about doug stam.
Hope will heckle a boxing.

2952
02:30:09,711 --> 02:30:14,630
Like when he starts the right way.
It isn't just dive right into the

2953
02:30:14,631 --> 02:30:16,700
holding down and fuck his face.
He's,

2954
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:20,120
he,
he starts with some like light jabs and

2955
02:30:20,121 --> 02:30:24,440
then he builds up and it gets more and
more bizarre and then it got to the

2956
02:30:24,441 --> 02:30:27,500
whole down and fuck his face.
But when he said hold him down and fuck

2957
02:30:27,501 --> 02:30:29,750
his face,
I remember just hear people go,

2958
02:30:29,751 --> 02:30:32,950
oh shit.
Dawn came.

2959
02:30:32,951 --> 02:30:35,580
He showed up at some dog king should
have.

2960
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:39,320
Remember the don king haeckel,
but don king showed up while you can

2961
02:30:39,321 --> 02:30:41,800
still hear of my ankles.
And uh,

2962
02:30:42,030 --> 02:30:44,300
uh,
what was the name of his movie?

2963
02:30:44,510 --> 02:30:47,210
Whatever in America,
only in America.

2964
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:49,040
Can you,
can you.

2965
02:30:49,041 --> 02:30:52,530
I yelled something only in America.
Can you fuck over somebody?

2966
02:30:52,531 --> 02:30:57,020
I know you had so many once,
but he was there and could hear every

2967
02:30:57,021 --> 02:30:57,890
word.
I said,

2968
02:30:58,310 --> 02:31:00,350
well,
you started getting laughs and that's

2969
02:31:00,351 --> 02:31:03,020
what had happened.
You started getting like big laughs and

2970
02:31:03,021 --> 02:31:05,570
then it became like kind of a weird
standup show.

2971
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:08,840
Oh,
so ridiculous.

2972
02:31:09,450 --> 02:31:12,400
It was so much fun.
He's one of the hill.

2973
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:17,440
He was fighting that night and a pepper
of freddie roach was his trainer.

2974
02:31:18,110 --> 02:31:18,960
Really?
Yeah.

2975
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:19,823
Yeah.

2976
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:24,120
Freddie roach was in the telemarketing
business with me before he ever got into

2977
02:31:24,121 --> 02:31:26,910
parkinson's.
Are boxing,

2978
02:31:26,911 --> 02:31:29,790
whatever.
it started out with boxing and then

2979
02:31:29,791 --> 02:31:34,791
showed its true form parkinson's.
Him and his brother pepper or you have

2980
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:37,320
both.
They're both punchy as fuck,

2981
02:31:37,321 --> 02:31:40,680
but I did tell them marketing with them
in the eighties in vegas.

2982
02:31:41,580 --> 02:31:43,140
He's a nice guy,
man.

2983
02:31:43,141 --> 02:31:46,080
I did an interview with him a long time
ago for the ufc.

2984
02:31:46,210 --> 02:31:49,710
It was probably like four or five years
ago and he's such a nice guy.

2985
02:31:49,980 --> 02:31:51,150
Freddie roach.
He,

2986
02:31:51,630 --> 02:31:55,620
you know,
he might be hindered by this parkinson's

2987
02:31:55,621 --> 02:31:58,590
disease,
which is pretty pretty honest about

2988
02:31:58,591 --> 02:31:59,820
that.
It's trauma related,

2989
02:32:00,270 --> 02:32:02,370
but he's pretty sharp underneath there,
man.

2990
02:32:02,371 --> 02:32:03,750
He's not stupid.
Yeah,

2991
02:32:03,751 --> 02:32:05,770
parkinson's is one of those things.
I.

2992
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:08,970
I used to use that as an example of
being drunk.

2993
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:13,740
My motor skills are slow and I'm
slurring and I'm stuttering.

2994
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:17,970
My brain's working and that's what yo
see.

2995
02:32:17,971 --> 02:32:21,580
P or fucking whatever,
chris,

2996
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:26,600
crazy legs funds saika denver comic.
He's got whatever it is,

2997
02:32:26,641 --> 02:32:31,641
cerebral palsy and guy created this.
He's also a wicked alcoholic.

2998
02:32:33,330 --> 02:32:38,330
That doesn't help but just jogging,
like greed gig guys ruined me.

2999
02:32:40,291 --> 02:32:43,500
I'm really guarded and that's what being
a drunk is like.

3000
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:45,690
Yeah,
my mind is functioning well,

3001
02:32:45,691 --> 02:32:49,880
but the more I drank your Jack Daniels,
the more my mouth go.

3002
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:53,460
Yeah,
man though,

3003
02:32:53,470 --> 02:32:56,460
he also make bad choices.
Bad choices.

3004
02:32:56,461 --> 02:32:59,610
Cerebral palsy doesn't call hookers in
the middle of the night,

3005
02:32:59,611 --> 02:33:04,611
going a bit more than he expected to not
call hookers in the middle of the night.

3006
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:07,470
If you have cerebral palsy,
like at that point,

3007
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:08,850
all bets are off,
right?

3008
02:33:09,030 --> 02:33:10,780
No,
I'm saying cerebral palsy.

3009
02:33:10,781 --> 02:33:14,190
He doesn't regret having cerebral palsy
in the morning.

3010
02:33:14,330 --> 02:33:15,330
Right?
Oh,

3011
02:33:15,331 --> 02:33:16,530
I get it.
I see what you're saying.

3012
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:20,910
Yeah.
He's just drunk when I paid $500 to not

3013
02:33:20,911 --> 02:33:23,040
fuck me.
There's a lot of story behind this that

3014
02:33:23,041 --> 02:33:26,300
I can't tell on the
lease.

3015
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:29,200
Hold is.
It was a last night,

3016
02:33:29,220 --> 02:33:32,530
was a bad night,
but it will save him is on the stove

3017
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:38,460
or robby krieger there.
I don't know who's there.

3018
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:43,650
You know.
One of the things that I enjoy about

3019
02:33:43,651 --> 02:33:44,041
you,
doug,

3020
02:33:44,041 --> 02:33:47,520
stan hope is that you,
you still seems to be,

3021
02:33:48,090 --> 02:33:53,090
at least to me when I listen to your
podcasts especially who's still trying

3022
02:33:53,431 --> 02:33:55,650
to have fun.
You're still,

3023
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:58,490
no matter what weirdness comes your way,
he tries like,

3024
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:03,640
like break up fucking chaos,
road travel who are still trying to have

3025
02:34:05,671 --> 02:34:08,400
fun,
key word trying.

3026
02:34:08,730 --> 02:34:12,600
You shouldn't have to try to have fun.
The same as a relationship.

3027
02:34:12,930 --> 02:34:15,780
You shouldn't have to try in a
relationship.

3028
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:16,960
People say,
oh,

3029
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:19,030
relationship is a.
It's really hard.

3030
02:34:19,031 --> 02:34:23,050
You have to really try.
Well the no do we try and our

3031
02:34:23,051 --> 02:34:25,950
relationship,
we've been friends from fucking 15,

3032
02:34:25,980 --> 02:34:27,090
20 years.
I

3033
02:34:28,690 --> 02:34:31,450
just try to,
you know,

3034
02:34:31,470 --> 02:34:36,470
I'm going to have to like,
let's go to counseling to be friends.

3035
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:37,820
No,
you don't have to.

3036
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:40,630
If it's a good relationship,
you don't have to try.

3037
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:42,370
When I hear people doing the counseling
thing,

3038
02:34:42,371 --> 02:34:43,810
I'm like,
oh man,

3039
02:34:44,590 --> 02:34:46,060
fuck off.
Well,

3040
02:34:46,061 --> 02:34:48,670
you know,
as long as you don't have to keep doing

3041
02:34:48,671 --> 02:34:50,650
it,
like the one of the problems that the

3042
02:34:50,651 --> 02:34:54,020
counseling is a lot of people that
you've done out.

3043
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:56,130
No,
no,

3044
02:34:56,590 --> 02:35:00,760
but I have on my life he had been like a
going into isolation tanks.

3045
02:35:01,230 --> 02:35:05,810
That's my own form of counseling.
Pot cookies or any sort of pot edible in

3046
02:35:05,811 --> 02:35:10,811
an isolation tank is so much more
intensely introspective than any,

3047
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:14,170
any,
any other person that you don't really

3048
02:35:14,171 --> 02:35:15,400
know,
like you know,

3049
02:35:15,401 --> 02:35:16,690
you,
you know,

3050
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:18,040
you know you.
So if you,

3051
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:23,880
if you do like some real heavy dose of
edible marijuana in an isolation tank,

3052
02:35:24,850 --> 02:35:29,850
you get to look at yourself and like a
really weirdly introspective way.

3053
02:35:30,850 --> 02:35:32,280
No,
no,

3054
02:35:32,430 --> 02:35:36,700
I think that's one of the things that's
so fun about alcohol because it frees

3055
02:35:36,701 --> 02:35:41,701
you from a lot of the nonsense that's
involved and introspective thought with

3056
02:35:41,921 --> 02:35:44,460
a finite lifespan,
you know,

3057
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:45,380
because like,
like,

3058
02:35:45,380 --> 02:35:47,440
well how much you can figure out pitch.

3059
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:50,140
Yeah,
how much you going to figure out you're

3060
02:35:50,141 --> 02:35:55,141
going to die no matter what.
That's the freedom of that.

3061
02:35:56,231 --> 02:36:01,231
Alcohol sort of throws your way is the
freedom of realization that sometimes

3062
02:36:03,191 --> 02:36:08,191
moments are critically important.
They are sometimes more important in the

3063
02:36:09,761 --> 02:36:13,930
future,
the same way you must enjoy the,

3064
02:36:13,931 --> 02:36:18,931
uh,
the theater of like smoking pot.

3065
02:36:19,650 --> 02:36:22,630
You,
the way you chop up lines,

3066
02:36:22,631 --> 02:36:24,460
you don't drink coke,
the ceremony.

3067
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:28,030
Yes.
Chopping up lines and then finding a

3068
02:36:28,031 --> 02:36:32,080
straw and doing that.
I love that with alcohol.

3069
02:36:32,590 --> 02:36:37,590
Like I carry my own cocktail straws
Because I like a short glass with a

3070
02:36:38,831 --> 02:36:43,520
small cocktail straw.
I liked the ceremony and uh,

3071
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:46,630
there's something to that and then I get
drunk and go,

3072
02:36:46,631 --> 02:36:47,980
fuck it.
I'm just going to drink off.

3073
02:36:47,990 --> 02:36:50,560
Uh,
we know my thoughts are on rogan's

3074
02:36:50,630 --> 02:36:54,070
bottle.
Drink it straight to the ceremony.

3075
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:55,330
I have thoughts on that.

3076
02:36:55,650 --> 02:37:00,650
Do you ever go to the place where he
grew up in a visit and you have like

3077
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:02,840
this weird feeling like,
ah,

3078
02:37:03,030 --> 02:37:07,150
I haven't been to the place where I live
when I was in high school until I was

3079
02:37:07,151 --> 02:37:12,151
like 44 or 45 or something like that.
I went back and when I went back for the

3080
02:37:14,051 --> 02:37:16,130
first time in all those years,
it was really bizarre.

3081
02:37:16,131 --> 02:37:19,250
I was like,
there's like an attachment of ideas that

3082
02:37:19,251 --> 02:37:21,890
I have to this place,
you know,

3083
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:26,350
and I think that kind of carries on to
to.

3084
02:37:26,750 --> 02:37:28,250
Absolutely.
You know what I mean?

3085
02:37:29,380 --> 02:37:34,380
Having to write that book,
memories I have not shut out,

3086
02:37:35,211 --> 02:37:39,140
I just don't matter,
but I had to go back to write that book

3087
02:37:39,141 --> 02:37:43,580
and I just remembering these things that
happened.

3088
02:37:43,581 --> 02:37:44,414
I'm like,
oh,

3089
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:47,270
that's that feeling.
Yeah.

3090
02:37:47,990 --> 02:37:51,590
Just when I had her,
when I was doing that dumb run for

3091
02:37:51,591 --> 02:37:56,591
president and had to go back to a
fucking high school to talk to people

3092
02:37:56,601 --> 02:37:57,180
about it.

3093
02:37:57,180 --> 02:38:00,710
It was a short lived,
funny idea that wasn't funny at all.

3094
02:38:00,950 --> 02:38:05,950
But walking into a high school,
all that fear was absolutely relevant in

3095
02:38:08,091 --> 02:38:11,510
2007.
LIke I was 19,

3096
02:38:11,511 --> 02:38:13,160
79.
Right.

3097
02:38:13,161 --> 02:38:17,240
I'm terrified of being in a highschool.
Someone's going to beat me up,

3098
02:38:17,241 --> 02:38:21,500
someone's going to pick on me was just
right there at the surface.

3099
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:26,570
So yeah,
there's definitely a correlation.

3100
02:38:27,230 --> 02:38:31,870
I remember when you were doing the run
for president thing and you realized

3101
02:38:32,120 --> 02:38:34,430
early on there's no way you could do
standup.

3102
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:41,100
That one has any money I made from
standup would be a donations to the and

3103
02:38:43,491 --> 02:38:47,360
then you have to.
I can't do taxes when I do my taxes,

3104
02:38:47,361 --> 02:38:52,361
I just over pay on their behalf because
I suck at math so bad that if you ever

3105
02:38:54,021 --> 02:38:56,630
audited me,
you owe me money.

3106
02:38:56,930 --> 02:38:59,900
Does that make sense though?
I mean why would I stink at it?

3107
02:39:00,020 --> 02:39:01,010
But what?
Why would it.

3108
02:39:01,070 --> 02:39:04,220
Why would they be so terrified of people
speaking publicly?

3109
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:05,720
Well,
because that's what it is.

3110
02:39:05,721 --> 02:39:08,210
Like what is about your shows?
Like if you,

3111
02:39:08,211 --> 02:39:10,790
if you were a dentist and you're running
for president,

3112
02:39:10,791 --> 02:39:13,040
I would assume the.
You would still be able to work on

3113
02:39:13,041 --> 02:39:13,940
people's teeth.
Yes,

3114
02:39:14,810 --> 02:39:19,220
but as a public performer,
if you are going to be some sort of a

3115
02:39:19,221 --> 02:39:21,770
political figure,
like you're going to have a voice on a

3116
02:39:21,771 --> 02:39:23,810
soap box in front of all these people
with a microphone.

3117
02:39:24,110 --> 02:39:28,610
You can't do anything else on a
microphone because it's kinda the same

3118
02:39:28,611 --> 02:39:32,330
thing and their eyes.
There's something that's really similar

3119
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:36,980
between someone doing a political
politician act and someone doing a

3120
02:39:36,981 --> 02:39:39,230
standup act.
They're almost interchangeable.

3121
02:39:39,320 --> 02:39:41,720
They're.
They're essentially admitting that it's

3122
02:39:41,721 --> 02:39:44,150
show business.
There's no two drink minimum at a

3123
02:39:44,151 --> 02:39:46,700
fucking Donald Trump event.
Should be.

3124
02:39:47,270 --> 02:39:49,910
Should it be fucking awesome.
Humanity.

3125
02:39:50,610 --> 02:39:52,140
Just wait.
It's the countdown,

3126
02:39:52,170 --> 02:39:53,600
so someone screams,
nigger

3127
02:39:57,390 --> 02:40:00,190
feeding them.
Drake's just waiting.

3128
02:40:00,650 --> 02:40:03,890
Just waiting for someone to fucking pop
the n word views.

3129
02:40:04,480 --> 02:40:08,810
Just drunk enough to get a fucking giant
room full of trump supporters drunk

3130
02:40:08,811 --> 02:40:11,390
enough people say that.
Oh,

3131
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:13,860
as a comic,
wouldn't it be great if trump got

3132
02:40:13,861 --> 02:40:16,230
elected because your dad is so much
material?

3133
02:40:16,290 --> 02:40:16,801
Well,
no,

3134
02:40:16,801 --> 02:40:20,400
I'd have so much entertainment.
Go material.

3135
02:40:20,610 --> 02:40:24,210
you know,
comics who just find a news of the weird

3136
02:40:24,211 --> 02:40:27,570
article and just repeated on stage with.
No,

3137
02:40:27,571 --> 02:40:30,780
the joke was already written in the news
of the weird article.

3138
02:40:30,781 --> 02:40:34,710
You need punchlines.
Trump would be hilarious to me.

3139
02:40:34,711 --> 02:40:38,040
I wouldn't use it as material because
it's inherently funny.

3140
02:40:38,041 --> 02:40:40,980
Like a news of the weird article.
It didn't make sense.

3141
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:43,470
It is kind of right,
but how.

3142
02:40:43,490 --> 02:40:46,530
How much weirder is he than mitt romney?

3143
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:50,190
Because if I have to choose between a
guy who's,

3144
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:54,600
you know,
a part of some weird fucking ideology,

3145
02:40:55,030 --> 02:40:55,591
we.
Yeah,

3146
02:40:55,591 --> 02:41:00,591
weird ideology or a guy who's just a
super ambitious reality star who also a

3147
02:41:01,861 --> 02:41:04,620
billionaire real estate developer.
I'm going with that guy.

3148
02:41:04,621 --> 02:41:06,090
Even if he says,
yeah,

3149
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:10,280
he's for entertainment for himself.
Yes,

3150
02:41:11,890 --> 02:41:15,510
but maybe not just he doesn't give a
fuck about you or the country,

3151
02:41:15,511 --> 02:41:18,120
but maybe he's entertaining.
Maybe a little,

3152
02:41:18,420 --> 02:41:21,450
maybe a little.
Remember when barack first get elected

3153
02:41:21,451 --> 02:41:22,261
and you thought,
oh,

3154
02:41:22,261 --> 02:41:25,980
maybe he's over.
Things will really change in within

3155
02:41:25,981 --> 02:41:26,790
minutes.
you go,

3156
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:28,690
nah,
nah dude,

3157
02:41:28,710 --> 02:41:31,590
it was black people and white people are
the same.

3158
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:36,620
It's just the amount of money they have
or why it was a.

3159
02:41:36,990 --> 02:41:41,130
It was a moment where I think I've kind
of like for the first time I understood

3160
02:41:41,131 --> 02:41:46,131
that to be someone that gets into a
position like the president or something

3161
02:41:47,341 --> 02:41:47,910
like that.

3162
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:52,500
The idea that that one person makes all
the calls for all the decisions that get

3163
02:41:52,501 --> 02:41:56,610
made about all the functions of our
government and education system and,

3164
02:41:56,960 --> 02:41:58,260
and then,
and then it is,

3165
02:41:58,610 --> 02:42:01,020
you know,
first responders and cops and

3166
02:42:01,021 --> 02:42:02,400
firefighters.
There's no way.

3167
02:42:02,550 --> 02:42:04,620
There's no way.
There's no way you can pin it on one

3168
02:42:04,621 --> 02:42:05,910
guy.
He just can't do it.

3169
02:42:05,911 --> 02:42:07,020
No,
it's not.

3170
02:42:07,590 --> 02:42:12,590
It's an american one president that has
affected your life that your life

3171
02:42:14,521 --> 02:42:17,550
wouldn't have gone that way regardless.
Ronald reagan,

3172
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:18,900
him,
and what happened?

3173
02:42:18,930 --> 02:42:22,200
What happened to you?
Ronald reagan fucked up everything for

3174
02:42:22,201 --> 02:42:24,540
your life specifically.
I'll say no,

3175
02:42:24,610 --> 02:42:27,750
there are people do.
They said some saying kim jong,

3176
02:42:27,751 --> 02:42:29,310
il.
Listen,

3177
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:31,710
I'm a fan of narcos.
It's on netflix.

3178
02:42:31,800 --> 02:42:35,130
I haven't watched it yet.
Get on it immediately.

3179
02:42:35,210 --> 02:42:39,210
You know why I haven't watched it yet
because I think that I have things I

3180
02:42:39,211 --> 02:42:42,570
have to do and I don't.
So I,

3181
02:42:42,571 --> 02:42:47,571
I'm putting off narcos until I have some
time off from the life I have that

3182
02:42:49,170 --> 02:42:51,810
sedentary anyway,
but I have a list.

3183
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:54,120
What is it?
Creating a mentor too drunk to be on

3184
02:42:54,121 --> 02:42:57,270
this podcast.
Make or have you gotten there yet?

3185
02:42:57,460 --> 02:43:01,950
Oh,
if you have not watched this staircase,

3186
02:43:02,490 --> 02:43:07,080
watched that and then watch making a
murderer because making a murder of will

3187
02:43:07,081 --> 02:43:12,081
make you very upset for about 24 hours
and then you in hindsight

3188
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,410
go,
yay.

3189
02:43:13,430 --> 02:43:16,300
Probably did it.
Watch the staircase,

3190
02:43:16,301 --> 02:43:21,301
which is a 15 years old where they give
full access to the prosecution as well.

3191
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:28,920
Making a murderer is completely biased.
They're trying to make you think that

3192
02:43:29,471 --> 02:43:32,710
guy's innocent.
Then you find out behind the scenes,

3193
02:43:32,860 --> 02:43:35,110
oh,
that girl from the auto trader,

3194
02:43:35,111 --> 02:43:40,111
he had called several times,
answered the door in a bathrobe once a

3195
02:43:40,910 --> 02:43:44,470
use trying to get.
She asked to not have to go there.

3196
02:43:44,471 --> 02:43:47,380
The guy he wrote her,
actually,

3197
02:43:47,381 --> 02:43:48,900
he did murder.
Sumi

3198
02:43:50,510 --> 02:43:52,990
is by the way,
is available on netflix,

3199
02:43:52,991 --> 02:43:56,470
but only on disk.
You have to order a staircase.

3200
02:43:56,500 --> 02:44:00,490
Giant spoiler alert.
This whitney coming say to a watch.

3201
02:44:00,491 --> 02:44:03,730
That was her recommending staircase.
You know what?

3202
02:44:03,731 --> 02:44:08,731
I would fuck people on twitter.
I would fuck whitney cummings if I could

3203
02:44:09,161 --> 02:44:13,840
just change her act.
You heard it here first.

3204
02:44:15,330 --> 02:44:17,760
Her sister is my yoga teacher,
which is very nice.

3205
02:44:17,810 --> 02:44:21,060
Yellow.
Let's not get fucking five degrees of

3206
02:44:21,061 --> 02:44:22,410
kevin bacon up in this bitch.

3207
02:44:22,870 --> 02:44:27,320
Jesus christ.
That was just a call back to an earlier

3208
02:44:27,321 --> 02:44:30,720
joke and it's not at your expense.
Riders on the stove.

3209
02:44:31,730 --> 02:44:33,350
Get me out of here.
I'm fucking drunk.

3210
02:44:33,351 --> 02:44:34,460
I get to go home.
Yeah,

3211
02:44:34,580 --> 02:44:36,710
I booked a ticket.
I get a lead time.

3212
02:44:36,770 --> 02:44:38,970
What's happening now?
Okay.

3213
02:44:39,320 --> 02:44:41,480
All I fucking left.
I came here.

3214
02:44:43,490 --> 02:44:46,400
I didn't say which nine,
but I have to leave at nine.

3215
02:44:46,520 --> 02:44:47,600
Well,
it can't be pm.

3216
02:44:47,601 --> 02:44:50,520
That's a long time from now.
Have no sympathy of as a pm.

3217
02:44:51,490 --> 02:44:54,160
I'm shit.
Okay.

3218
02:44:54,170 --> 02:44:55,003
We're good.

3219
02:44:55,610 --> 02:44:56,450
We've,
we're all right.

3220
02:44:56,870 --> 02:44:58,530
Hannigan,
you're in charge of this fucking ship,

3221
02:44:58,550 --> 02:44:59,840
right?
I had a question for you.

3222
02:44:59,841 --> 02:45:02,480
joe.
You're evolve as a question for you.

3223
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:06,890
Do you use two phrases of the year
phrases or did he come from somewhere?

3224
02:45:06,910 --> 02:45:10,160
I would say obsessive struggle and
mental mortgage.

3225
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:12,130
Um,
I don't.

3226
02:45:12,250 --> 02:45:14,330
I don't think I can claim either one of
them,

3227
02:45:14,331 --> 02:45:17,030
but obsessive struggle.
I think I am.

3228
02:45:17,270 --> 02:45:19,310
The first time I said it,
I think was just.

3229
02:45:19,311 --> 02:45:21,170
Then I don't believe I've said that
before,

3230
02:45:21,380 --> 02:45:26,380
but the idea is
someone at it throwing someone at a

3231
02:45:29,741 --> 02:45:34,741
swing and careful about how we express
our opinion about this amy schumer thing

3232
02:45:35,991 --> 02:45:39,080
without being completely serious.
Oh yeah.

3233
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:42,440
It's another podcast.
I'm too drunk to defend my.

3234
02:45:42,990 --> 02:45:47,990
I don't want to jeopardize
the only like you live here.

3235
02:45:49,670 --> 02:45:52,370
I don't live around comedy.
You have more knowledge.

3236
02:45:52,430 --> 02:45:56,660
I would defend amy schumer,
but with blanks because I don't know.

3237
02:45:56,740 --> 02:45:58,130
Yeah,
I don't know either,

3238
02:45:58,430 --> 02:46:02,710
but I do know the w.
What's been proven is that the real

3239
02:46:02,720 --> 02:46:06,980
agregious ones that people believe are
an issue were written by other people

3240
02:46:07,340 --> 02:46:10,180
written by writers.
That's a.

3241
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:15,320
That's why I was going to use schumer
who I know nothing about other than I

3242
02:46:15,321 --> 02:46:19,010
laughed at or special,
but there were times where bill maher

3243
02:46:19,670 --> 02:46:20,990
did shit where,
yo,

3244
02:46:21,380 --> 02:46:24,410
that's fucking mine because I'm a.
Yeah,

3245
02:46:25,250 --> 02:46:29,180
I don't think it's not a pedestrian
fucking comic and I would blame the

3246
02:46:29,181 --> 02:46:32,270
writers,
but I don't care because they can write

3247
02:46:32,271 --> 02:46:33,530
other shit.
Well,

3248
02:46:33,531 --> 02:46:37,550
there was a time where they kicked
writers of the back of the comedy store

3249
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:38,450
because,
uh,

3250
02:46:38,450 --> 02:46:43,310
they were writing for a sketch show.
They were going on stage,

3251
02:46:43,490 --> 02:46:47,480
these comics going onstage and coming up
with these funny premises that would

3252
02:46:47,481 --> 02:46:49,520
wind up on these television sketch
shows,

3253
02:46:49,850 --> 02:46:54,320
it wanting to be acted out in a sketch.
And the people that were the writers of

3254
02:46:54,321 --> 02:46:57,440
the sketch show would go to the comedy
store and sit in the back room and they

3255
02:46:57,441 --> 02:46:58,130
got kicked out.

3256
02:46:58,130 --> 02:46:59,120
Wow.
Yeah.

3257
02:46:59,180 --> 02:47:01,130
And they got kicked out because they
were,

3258
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:03,130
you know,
this was in the nineties,

3259
02:47:03,150 --> 02:47:05,120
ish.
You could get away with doing that kind

3260
02:47:05,121 --> 02:47:06,520
of shit.
You know what?

3261
02:47:06,660 --> 02:47:09,860
It's not.
It's like to put it all on her

3262
02:47:09,861 --> 02:47:10,820
shoulders.
His work.

3263
02:47:10,821 --> 02:47:12,050
It's weird.
It's like,

3264
02:47:12,051 --> 02:47:16,070
who the fuck knows who's writing those
sketches?

3265
02:47:16,370 --> 02:47:18,170
You know,
who knows what's writing those things.

3266
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:20,570
The point is,
if she's already said it,

3267
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:23,810
then it should be done.
If she said it publicly,

3268
02:47:23,990 --> 02:47:25,820
if you're in the back of the comedy
store,

3269
02:47:25,821 --> 02:47:30,821
when someone's working out some shit.
I've had several people do shit that I

3270
02:47:33,381 --> 02:47:38,381
already put out on dvd.
One of them became famous because of one

3271
02:47:38,631 --> 02:47:42,410
of a kevin booths,
yeah,

3272
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:43,250
word of mouth,
but,

3273
02:47:43,250 --> 02:47:47,510
and he's admitted to me that he stole
that bit and that's what made it.

3274
02:47:47,690 --> 02:47:50,300
But I,
I stopped doing that because I put it on

3275
02:47:50,301 --> 02:47:54,170
a dvd and he's a nice guy.
He's got some problems,

3276
02:47:54,560 --> 02:47:57,950
but I don't give a fuck.
I got real problems in life.

3277
02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:00,640
It's just become.
It's like,

3278
02:48:00,641 --> 02:48:03,470
it's not like saying like this.
Someone comes up with somebody else's

3279
02:48:03,471 --> 02:48:05,030
idea.
they could never come up with their own

3280
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:07,460
because you still can,
but

3281
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:13,190
you're way better off just trying to
come up with all your own ideas.

3282
02:48:13,220 --> 02:48:18,220
If you came out with a story about a
euthanizing your own mother or attending

3283
02:48:19,671 --> 02:48:22,150
that euthanization like yerba.

3284
02:48:26,060 --> 02:48:28,370
I already put it out.
I don't give a fuck.

3285
02:48:28,790 --> 02:48:31,310
Well,
the only way someone would ever be able

3286
02:48:31,311 --> 02:48:36,311
to get away with it is if it was their
experience and they acknowledged that

3287
02:48:38,121 --> 02:48:40,460
they had heard of your experience as
well.

3288
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:46,120
Like if someone becAme famous because of
that and

3289
02:48:48,290 --> 02:48:51,800
you're going.
But if some open mic or tried to do it,

3290
02:48:51,810 --> 02:48:54,920
who are going to be fucking called out
eventually fuck you.

3291
02:48:54,921 --> 02:48:57,650
I don't care.
I'm my life moves on.

3292
02:48:57,651 --> 02:49:00,650
I have real problems in my life.
But let me ask you this because that's

3293
02:49:00,651 --> 02:49:03,070
an intensely personal thing.
If a,

3294
02:49:03,071 --> 02:49:07,950
an open mic or say really did have an
experience where his mother

3295
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:13,130
wanted him to help her commit suicide
and he went through with it and she died

3296
02:49:14,070 --> 02:49:19,070
and he decided to do a bit about it.
But acknowledging that he had seen your

3297
02:49:21,871 --> 02:49:26,420
bit as well,
like not not going through with it.

3298
02:49:26,430 --> 02:49:26,661
yeah.
Yeah.

3299
02:49:26,661 --> 02:49:30,090
It wasn't acknowledged me at all.
Well I think you should.

3300
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:34,410
If someone stole that blatantly from me,
that's a different story.

3301
02:49:34,440 --> 02:49:37,590
But eliminate fuck because I have real
problem.

3302
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:40,990
But to eliminate doubt.
Like if a guy only has on stage an hour,

3303
02:49:41,130 --> 02:49:41,990
right?
There's,

3304
02:49:42,330 --> 02:49:45,330
you don't want anybody in a state of
confusion going,

3305
02:49:46,050 --> 02:49:48,570
doug stanhope just joke about,
you know,

3306
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:51,480
putting his mother to death.
You have to address that because that's

3307
02:49:51,481 --> 02:49:54,200
a big joke that you have.
Like it's like it's,

3308
02:49:54,201 --> 02:49:58,170
it's really like well respected and
enjoyed.

3309
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:00,840
Joke,
so if someone was a doug stanhope fan

3310
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:05,310
and they came to see this new dude and
this new dude really did have to help

3311
02:50:05,311 --> 02:50:06,570
his mom killed herself.

3312
02:50:06,750 --> 02:50:07,583
Right.
And,

3313
02:50:07,630 --> 02:50:08,580
and he said,
well,

3314
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:11,400
I just have to say before I talked to
this,

3315
02:50:11,540 --> 02:50:14,700
I've talked about this,
like one of my favorite comedians,

3316
02:50:14,701 --> 02:50:19,410
doug stan hope or a guy I think is
fairly mediocre but extremely exciting.

3317
02:50:19,590 --> 02:50:21,750
Like whatever description he has for
you,

3318
02:50:22,190 --> 02:50:24,870
he should have to admit I'm a doug stand
hold fan.

3319
02:50:24,871 --> 02:50:27,380
I've listened to his comedy.
I think he's great and I,

3320
02:50:27,381 --> 02:50:29,550
I,
I couldn't believe this was happening to

3321
02:50:29,551 --> 02:50:32,340
me as well.
Like then he's talking about his own

3322
02:50:32,341 --> 02:50:35,820
life experience.
Like you can't eliminate a person's life

3323
02:50:35,821 --> 02:50:40,821
experience from the right,
but I think you like to make it easier

3324
02:50:40,861 --> 02:50:43,620
for everybody listening.
They should probably knowledge.

3325
02:50:43,830 --> 02:50:47,160
Like if someone did have to help their
mom committed suicide,

3326
02:50:47,161 --> 02:50:51,420
they should have to say in some sort of
a way if they shouldn't have to,

3327
02:50:51,421 --> 02:50:53,580
but it would be smart to say I've done
that.

3328
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:57,840
Where I go is like so and so said.
Yeah,

3329
02:50:57,870 --> 02:50:59,490
but this happened to me.
Yeah.

3330
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:04,470
Know it's good.
A question with a question would be like

3331
02:51:04,710 --> 02:51:07,290
going back to something jo said earlier,
which was,

3332
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:12,500
what if that person is chris rock who's
like so much bigger and nobody knows who

3333
02:51:13,741 --> 02:51:17,100
the fuck you are?
Then you as joe rogan to step in and go,

3334
02:51:17,220 --> 02:51:20,040
I'm sorry carlos,
but are we already did that

3335
02:51:21,660 --> 02:51:25,000
and then you crush.
There's not a whole lot of guys that are

3336
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:30,030
little spot where his career,
and I don't know if it's because you

3337
02:51:30,031 --> 02:51:35,031
deflated his ego so much or his
confidence or the people spoke out,

3338
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:42,440
but after that incident he disappeared.
He went down to my level where if we're

3339
02:51:43,921 --> 02:51:48,810
doing a wednesday at the cleveland
improv one show only,

3340
02:51:48,811 --> 02:51:53,811
he's doing a thursday or vice versa,
but honestly that is not a bad thing.

3341
02:51:55,200 --> 02:52:00,200
Like what his life is is really good.
If he's headlined in these really nice

3342
02:52:00,391 --> 02:52:03,840
clubs all over the country,
he's not like in a bad place.

3343
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:06,010
You know what happened?

3344
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:11,010
There was all judgment aside.
What a.

3345
02:52:11,980 --> 02:52:16,340
There was like a blip in the matrix.
There was a problem with the,

3346
02:52:16,341 --> 02:52:19,960
the the operating system.
There was a reaL issue with how things

3347
02:52:19,961 --> 02:52:24,940
were going and guys like all of us,
anybody that was watching it was going,

3348
02:52:24,941 --> 02:52:26,900
well,
people are being being fucking

3349
02:52:27,130 --> 02:52:29,110
victimized here.
Like we had a real problem here,

3350
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:31,360
like someone's taken.
It wasn't even taken from me.

3351
02:52:31,630 --> 02:52:34,840
he wasn't taken from you,
but it was some weird parasitic

3352
02:52:34,841 --> 02:52:38,800
situation that had been accepted into
the community because of sort of,

3353
02:52:39,400 --> 02:52:42,070
I don't like the term reverse racism,
but there's some,

3354
02:52:42,160 --> 02:52:47,160
some weird thing about choosing to like
pretend that some guys mexican is

3355
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:51,520
because you think there's a market for
mexicans and this guy goes in there and

3356
02:52:51,521 --> 02:52:54,820
start stealing people's bits and
everybody accepts everything and then

3357
02:52:54,830 --> 02:52:56,920
the artists are sitting back,
sitting back on,

3358
02:52:56,921 --> 02:52:59,830
what the fuck are you doing?
Like you guys have found some weird

3359
02:53:00,610 --> 02:53:04,170
vein,
some weird river of revenue and the

3360
02:53:04,230 --> 02:53:06,460
attention,
and in this river of revenue and

3361
02:53:06,461 --> 02:53:08,200
attention,
you have to have a specific sort of

3362
02:53:08,290 --> 02:53:10,710
stereotypical ethnicity.
Uh,

3363
02:53:10,910 --> 02:53:13,830
so let's change your layout.
You know,

3364
02:53:14,580 --> 02:53:19,580
but that's exactly where you should not
give a fuck because those are not the

3365
02:53:20,161 --> 02:53:23,670
people you want to talk to.
The the whole idea that,

3366
02:53:23,880 --> 02:53:24,713
well,
oh,

3367
02:53:24,750 --> 02:53:28,050
he only likes them.
That's why I always hate the audience

3368
02:53:28,051 --> 02:53:31,400
instead of the artists.
If you can fucking have you,

3369
02:53:31,620 --> 02:53:35,210
if you're going to be a televangelist
and make a lot of people clap.

3370
02:53:35,860 --> 02:53:37,230
Yeah.
I'm going to hate you,

3371
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,800
but I,
I can't hate you too much because you

3372
02:53:39,801 --> 02:53:43,350
got just like we have,
we have a cult.

3373
02:53:43,590 --> 02:53:47,430
You have a culture.
I have a cult are called commingle,

3374
02:53:47,640 --> 02:53:51,790
but we're fucking leaders of a cult.
So how dare you doug?

3375
02:53:51,810 --> 02:53:52,720
Stand home.
Prevailed.

3376
02:53:52,730 --> 02:53:56,740
The game.
Fucking tee shirts for your cold.

3377
02:53:57,530 --> 02:53:58,690
Cool t shirts.
Okay.

3378
02:53:59,610 --> 02:54:01,470
This caveman coffee.
This is tate fletcher.

3379
02:54:01,471 --> 02:54:06,471
Shirt point is people want to be led and
you get upset when their lead poorly by

3380
02:54:10,411 --> 02:54:12,210
some.
He's not even mexican.

3381
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:13,800
Well,
they don't give a fuck.

3382
02:54:13,820 --> 02:54:16,050
That's not the.
It's the body issue.

3383
02:54:16,750 --> 02:54:18,010
The problem.
No.

3384
02:54:18,030 --> 02:54:20,640
People didn't feel like they could go on

3385
02:54:20,810 --> 02:54:24,770
stage in front of him if they weren't
famous because he would do their stuff

3386
02:54:24,771 --> 02:54:28,040
on comedy central and then this stuff
would no longer be their stuff because

3387
02:54:28,041 --> 02:54:29,190
if a guy's,
you know,

3388
02:54:29,230 --> 02:54:32,750
lupe fiasco and he's going up fucking
thursday night at the comedy store.

3389
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:34,340
Dad,
I'm tired.

3390
02:54:35,050 --> 02:54:40,050
I've been in the loop for awhile,
but there's a million channels between

3391
02:54:40,260 --> 02:54:45,260
the internet and tv and everything so I
could actually steal people's material

3392
02:54:47,250 --> 02:54:52,250
and they would never know because
it's such a broad spectrum.

3393
02:54:53,430 --> 02:54:55,770
Not ever.
Not for channels.

3394
02:54:55,771 --> 02:55:00,771
Like when we were kids and oh,
he said that on Johnny Carson last

3395
02:55:00,990 --> 02:55:04,710
night.
You could steal material a

3396
02:55:05,980 --> 02:55:10,610
fucking fitzsimmons fitzsimmons had a
bit on one of his cds.

3397
02:55:10,820 --> 02:55:14,960
That was one of my bits.
I know we didn't steal it and then I had

3398
02:55:14,961 --> 02:55:19,010
one a bit silly and I called him up and
I go,

3399
02:55:19,770 --> 02:55:24,770
you know what,
you one of my bits and bits,

3400
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:29,210
anything I don't give a fuck.
well fitzsimmons,

3401
02:55:29,390 --> 02:55:33,470
like he's a guy,
like if somehow or another you guys

3402
02:55:33,471 --> 02:55:37,460
tread on the same territory.
It's not by accident.

3403
02:55:37,461 --> 02:55:38,660
I mean,
it's not on purpose,

3404
02:55:38,661 --> 02:55:41,330
it's definitely a,
it's definitely a case of parallel

3405
02:55:41,331 --> 02:55:43,220
thinking,
but you would always know that if you

3406
02:55:43,221 --> 02:55:47,090
know fitzsimmons,
like if you felt very comfortable in

3407
02:55:47,091 --> 02:55:50,900
doing that bit.
Even after I heard fitzsimmons do it on

3408
02:55:50,901 --> 02:55:55,901
a cd
because I know he knows I didn't steal

3409
02:55:56,511 --> 02:55:57,410
it.
So of course.

3410
02:55:57,411 --> 02:55:58,700
Yeah.
I thought of this.

3411
02:55:58,701 --> 02:56:03,560
I know you.
Comedy is used to be a very small

3412
02:56:03,561 --> 02:56:04,394
community.

3413
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:07,070
Maybe it's bigger when you live in la.
Well he,

3414
02:56:07,071 --> 02:56:10,040
it is the gut with the guy like
fitzsimmons with fitzsimmons.

3415
02:56:10,041 --> 02:56:12,000
It's a real small community because
he'll,

3416
02:56:12,020 --> 02:56:13,940
he'll be 100 percent real with you.
You know,

3417
02:56:13,970 --> 02:56:16,660
if you've talked to him about fucking
fitzsimmons yeah,

3418
02:56:16,700 --> 02:56:18,260
he's not.
This is like,

3419
02:56:18,680 --> 02:56:20,080
he doesn't,
he's not.

3420
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:24,020
It's not possible for him to be a thief.
It'd be like breathing underwater.

3421
02:56:24,050 --> 02:56:26,060
Like he's never going to be a thief.
Bill burger.

3422
02:56:26,061 --> 02:56:29,900
I was hundred percent same.
One of the things we filmed for the bbc,

3423
02:56:29,901 --> 02:56:31,040
I'm like,
I have,

3424
02:56:31,041 --> 02:56:35,450
this is just a riffing topical thing and
I called him up.

3425
02:56:35,451 --> 02:56:36,440
I go,
did you do that?

3426
02:56:36,620 --> 02:56:40,370
I Swear I heard this on your podcast and
he goes,

3427
02:56:40,371 --> 02:56:41,750
I don't remember saying that.
I go,

3428
02:56:41,751 --> 02:56:44,330
are you sure?
Because I'm about to do this thing for

3429
02:56:44,331 --> 02:56:49,331
the bbc.
Riffing on concussions are surprised and

3430
02:56:49,581 --> 02:56:53,630
I still swear he did it,
but he doesn't know.

3431
02:56:54,440 --> 02:56:54,921
He goes,
nah,

3432
02:56:54,921 --> 02:56:56,780
I don't remember saying that.
Go ahead do it,

3433
02:56:56,870 --> 02:56:57,860
but thanks.
Good.

3434
02:56:57,861 --> 02:56:59,840
Heads up.
So do you think you heard it from him or

3435
02:56:59,841 --> 02:57:02,120
do you think you also thought of it?
No,

3436
02:57:02,121 --> 02:57:06,860
I think I heard it from him and I
checked with him and he swears he never

3437
02:57:06,861 --> 02:57:08,910
said it.
So maybe he's just remember.

3438
02:57:09,310 --> 02:57:11,540
No one talks more than him if you think
about it,

3439
02:57:11,541 --> 02:57:14,180
because he's the only one talking on
most of his podcasts.

3440
02:57:14,210 --> 02:57:17,170
I know you don't.
I don't remember my podcast after he

3441
02:57:17,330 --> 02:57:20,120
brings his wife and,
and they have a little chit chat or it's

3442
02:57:20,121 --> 02:57:23,870
him by himself.
I got to go.

3443
02:57:27,240 --> 02:57:30,080
Did I ruin it with my bill burr
impression?

3444
02:57:31,640 --> 02:57:34,220
I thought I did a great bill burr and
suddenly goes,

3445
02:57:34,221 --> 02:57:37,580
stopped doing that.
One person tweeted,

3446
02:57:37,790 --> 02:57:42,380
stop thinking.
You sound like bill burr one press got

3447
02:57:42,381 --> 02:57:46,190
my head ruins the whole part.
Cocksucker burst the most.

3448
02:57:46,191 --> 02:57:50,930
FuckIng cocksuckers bears the most
amazing podcast to me because it's just,

3449
02:57:51,440 --> 02:57:54,050
yeah,
it's just him and he will go like if

3450
02:57:54,051 --> 02:57:56,570
you.
If you done a podcast with him before

3451
02:57:57,110 --> 02:57:59,720
one time and it just wind tomorrow
morning,

3452
02:57:59,930 --> 02:58:02,090
we just got to wind them up.
Burger is

3453
02:58:02,250 --> 02:58:05,400
one of those guys,
he'll like change subjects like in the

3454
02:58:05,400 --> 02:58:08,520
middle of talking and they'll turn
another corner and take you down a road

3455
02:58:08,521 --> 02:58:10,870
and other rant and it turned another
corner taken out of the other way.

3456
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:11,913
You just got to like,

3457
02:58:12,280 --> 02:58:16,030
he joined the ride like with such kid
gloves.

3458
02:58:16,031 --> 02:58:18,730
I was so fucked up wearing a leisure
suit.

3459
02:58:19,150 --> 02:58:22,180
You insisted on me driving with the top
down.

3460
02:58:22,280 --> 02:58:27,280
I had just done four hours of blow with
the musical artists named marilyn.

3461
02:58:29,440 --> 02:58:34,440
How dare you,
how dare you fucking just oLive oil.

3462
02:58:34,541 --> 02:58:37,980
And
it was a good hollywood

3463
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:42,480
moment.
One of the guys that I most look forward

3464
02:58:42,481 --> 02:58:45,990
to watching right now,
like if I was a standup comedy fan,

3465
02:58:46,240 --> 02:58:48,210
if I'd never done standup before and I
was like,

3466
02:58:48,211 --> 02:58:51,660
what do I like?
I w I would go see her every chance.

3467
02:58:51,661 --> 02:58:53,700
I could.
Vre and joey diaz.

3468
02:58:53,880 --> 02:58:57,150
If you could just give me bert and joey
diaz at the same comedy club every

3469
02:58:57,151 --> 02:58:59,730
weekend.
You could live in bisbee,

3470
02:58:59,731 --> 02:59:02,430
Arizona.
Just have bird and joey diaz.

3471
02:59:02,431 --> 02:59:03,230
Every weekend

3472
02:59:03,230 --> 02:59:08,230
I would take joey over burr only because
I like to see the chance of a flame out.

3473
02:59:13,060 --> 02:59:17,420
The difference between driving and go
into tone,

3474
02:59:17,421 --> 02:59:22,421
apos speed way where everyone has a
fucking vega with a cessna engine jacked

3475
02:59:24,261 --> 02:59:26,150
up into it and they hope it'll work.

3476
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:29,940
Did you ever see that video of that guy
was his tony stewart,

3477
02:59:30,090 --> 02:59:31,880
the guy that killed that guy on the
racetrack?

3478
02:59:32,390 --> 02:59:34,260
Yeah.
Some guy got out of his car.

3479
02:59:34,740 --> 02:59:38,550
Tony stewart hit him with his car.
It's so crazy to watch,

3480
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,360
but I remember thinking like that guy in
nascar,

3481
02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:44,580
like that's nascar,
that tony's tour guy.

3482
02:59:44,820 --> 02:59:48,690
That guy drives on the dirt too,
like you drive on the dirt and like a

3483
02:59:48,691 --> 02:59:51,420
dune buggy and the people he drives
with,

3484
02:59:51,421 --> 02:59:53,430
they get mad.
They get out of their fucking car and

3485
02:59:53,431 --> 02:59:58,431
you run them over like what?
What they get out of their fucking car.

3486
02:59:58,530 --> 03:00:02,190
Could you imagine someone in nascar got
out of their fucking car?

3487
03:00:02,880 --> 03:00:05,460
How fast those guys going?
I have no idea.

3488
03:00:05,590 --> 03:00:07,250
Injured 200 miles an hour.

3489
03:00:10,740 --> 03:00:12,060
But that's how I.
Same thing,

3490
03:00:12,061 --> 03:00:12,894
right?
Yeah.

3491
03:00:12,930 --> 03:00:15,320
Kind of the same thing,
but it's the idea that you'd get her

3492
03:00:15,410 --> 03:00:17,580
standing in the way of a car.
That was bizarre.

3493
03:00:17,581 --> 03:00:22,581
The guy got out and stood there I think
because the tony stewart guy's car hit

3494
03:00:23,551 --> 03:00:27,330
his car and so he got out.
Oh jesus.

3495
03:00:27,331 --> 03:00:29,160
Jamie,
why don't you make us watch that dude

3496
03:00:29,161 --> 03:00:33,150
cut tumbled under that car.
Oh god.

3497
03:00:33,151 --> 03:00:36,090
That's so awful there for them.
That's so awful.

3498
03:00:36,120 --> 03:00:37,380
So he did that.
Oh yeah,

3499
03:00:37,381 --> 03:00:39,000
he's dead.
That guy's dead.

3500
03:00:39,170 --> 03:00:41,980
And his whole family was upset and they
blamed,

3501
03:00:41,981 --> 03:00:46,981
really upset because he was killed.
They dreamed it blamed on the driver.

3502
03:00:48,450 --> 03:00:50,610
I don't know enough about driving,
you know?

3503
03:00:50,640 --> 03:00:53,970
I don't know enough about driving to
determine whether or not

3504
03:00:54,070 --> 03:00:57,210
he can drive.
I'm fine.

3505
03:00:58,720 --> 03:01:00,080
I know I know enough about

3506
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:02,860
lawyers.
Right,

3507
03:01:02,861 --> 03:01:05,890
but how does one make the distinction
whether or not he's at fault?

3508
03:01:06,970 --> 03:01:08,590
That's a.
That's a tricky distinction,

3509
03:01:08,591 --> 03:01:10,720
right?
I mean that guy just standing out there

3510
03:01:10,721 --> 03:01:12,670
in the middle of the track.
That's insane.

3511
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Watching footbaLl yesterday where we're
watching fucking helmet to helmet

3512
03:01:18,041 --> 03:01:19,160
contact,
that's.

3513
03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:23,470
That's assault and battery,
like intent to fuck.

3514
03:01:23,590 --> 03:01:27,550
That's attempted murder.
Basically your maiming people in a way.

3515
03:01:27,640 --> 03:01:29,050
Oh,
you're smashing people.

3516
03:01:29,170 --> 03:01:32,050
If I,
if I headbutted some dude in a bar,

3517
03:01:32,051 --> 03:01:36,130
could could I get a 15 yard penalty and
that's it,

3518
03:01:36,250 --> 03:01:40,300
but here's the question,
can you totally 100 percent be

3519
03:01:40,320 --> 03:01:45,320
responsible for head on head collisions
if you didn't intend them to be a head

3520
03:01:45,551 --> 03:01:49,360
on head collision and you're running
full clip towards some guy who's trying

3521
03:01:49,361 --> 03:01:52,150
to not have you tackle him like some
crazy shit happens,

3522
03:01:52,151 --> 03:01:53,860
right?
Like you have to take that into

3523
03:01:53,861 --> 03:01:55,250
consideration funnel.

3524
03:01:55,380 --> 03:01:59,380
What would it not completely go to the
criminal element where you go,

3525
03:02:00,220 --> 03:02:04,170
if it was against the law,
if it was against the rules and it was a

3526
03:02:04,180 --> 03:02:08,280
hockey brush,
shira thing where you got fucking wacky

3527
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:11,200
with a stick and the guy did time
horrific.

3528
03:02:11,260 --> 03:02:13,660
That was horrific.
See hockey's a problem.

3529
03:02:14,320 --> 03:02:16,990
and here's one of the problems with
hockey.

3530
03:02:17,210 --> 03:02:18,940
It's a,
it's awesome.

3531
03:02:19,150 --> 03:02:21,460
That's one problem.
And one of the reasons why it's awesome

3532
03:02:21,461 --> 03:02:23,310
as they let them fight.
Oh no,

3533
03:02:23,320 --> 03:02:28,090
it's awesome because of hd.
Now when you have 60 inches high

3534
03:02:28,091 --> 03:02:31,090
definition,
so you can watch this fucking sport and

3535
03:02:31,091 --> 03:02:31,924
yeah,
love it.

3536
03:02:32,260 --> 03:02:33,430
Well,
I love hockey too,

3537
03:02:33,431 --> 03:02:34,930
for the same reason.
I love music.

3538
03:02:34,990 --> 03:02:37,330
So I have zero fucking talent.
I can't even skate.

3539
03:02:37,720 --> 03:02:39,760
If I got on skates,
I'll fall flat on my ass.

3540
03:02:39,761 --> 03:02:41,090
I'm just retarded.
we,

3541
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:43,720
we,
we did play basketball at a,

3542
03:02:43,721 --> 03:02:48,540
a whorehouse once and yeah,
the storm.

3543
03:02:48,820 --> 03:02:50,140
My basketball is not good.
Yeah.

3544
03:02:50,170 --> 03:02:52,060
Yeah.
Mio rogan.

3545
03:02:52,210 --> 03:02:57,210
Skating's worse.
Joe rogan is as talented as me shooting

3546
03:02:57,251 --> 03:02:58,900
horse.
I,

3547
03:02:59,290 --> 03:03:00,160
I,
um,

3548
03:03:00,161 --> 03:03:03,790
I know a few.
Can I drop dennis hoff's name because he

3549
03:03:03,791 --> 03:03:05,980
doesn't get enough publicity on his own.

3550
03:03:08,890 --> 03:03:11,440
Um,
before we get out of here and doug,

3551
03:03:11,441 --> 03:03:13,540
stan,
hope I want to just tell you I'm leaving

3552
03:03:13,570 --> 03:03:14,403
now.
You just,

3553
03:03:14,410 --> 03:03:15,850
you finish up.
I'm going,

3554
03:03:15,910 --> 03:03:20,440
I just want to tell you I love what
you're doing and I love listening to

3555
03:03:20,441 --> 03:03:23,680
your podcast.
I love hearing about your antics down

3556
03:03:23,681 --> 03:03:28,210
there and bisbee and I wish you would
just run for mayor of bisbee and take

3557
03:03:28,211 --> 03:03:31,390
over and then we buy a comedy club and
we,

3558
03:03:31,391 --> 03:03:33,220
uh,
we just fucking,

3559
03:03:33,250 --> 03:03:37,090
you know,
we get the bar and free because those

3560
03:03:37,091 --> 03:03:39,400
people who can't pay any money to get
angry.

3561
03:03:39,580 --> 03:03:42,010
I didn't want a comedy club in my house.
that's right.

3562
03:03:42,250 --> 03:03:45,040
That's what I hear.
That's gonna work.

3563
03:03:45,490 --> 03:03:47,320
It's gonna work.
It's already working.

3564
03:03:47,350 --> 03:03:49,090
Correct.
Just for common,

3565
03:03:49,110 --> 03:03:50,260
especially at your house,
right?

3566
03:03:50,340 --> 03:03:51,670
Yes.
and uh,

3567
03:03:51,850 --> 03:03:53,580
except for the lighting.
Uh,

3568
03:03:53,710 --> 03:03:55,880
shut up.
Was it,

3569
03:03:56,740 --> 03:03:57,990
was it bright?

3570
03:03:58,970 --> 03:04:02,000
It never gets it with walls are painted.
You guys play this sentence?

3571
03:04:02,900 --> 03:04:03,570
No,
no.

3572
03:04:03,570 --> 03:04:04,880
I was,
I took,

3573
03:04:04,890 --> 03:04:09,890
I add an hour's worth of shit that
either I hadn't done on tape or get cut

3574
03:04:11,031 --> 03:04:16,031
out of other specials to make it an hour
and I got it while we're filming here.

3575
03:04:16,851 --> 03:04:19,790
Anyway,
we have a crew that's film one right in

3576
03:04:19,791 --> 03:04:24,170
the house at the funhouse going put 35
people tightly packed

3577
03:04:25,880 --> 03:04:29,540
and it fucking killed except when you
see the footage.

3578
03:04:29,750 --> 03:04:34,750
It was too brightly lit and that you
could do the reverse sweatshirts on the

3579
03:04:36,891 --> 03:04:39,920
internet.
Do you could use a negative filter,

3580
03:04:40,070 --> 03:04:43,070
so filter that makes it look like more
gloomy.

3581
03:04:43,190 --> 03:04:47,690
like maybe I
should try to make it gloomy.

3582
03:04:47,840 --> 03:04:48,621
Don't worry.
He'll be fake.

3583
03:04:48,621 --> 03:04:53,060
You can do it.
One is the audience was great and the

3584
03:04:53,061 --> 03:04:58,061
audience are my friends and they'll
laugh all the time and I can film comics

3585
03:04:58,520 --> 03:05:01,490
I like rather than say,
hey,

3586
03:05:01,491 --> 03:05:03,620
go bananas,
will you book my friend?

3587
03:05:05,120 --> 03:05:06,980
Hey,
let's fIlm it right here.

3588
03:05:07,070 --> 03:05:11,270
Am I my friends?
I can pack my own house every fucking

3589
03:05:11,271 --> 03:05:15,320
weekend and film dvds.
I think you should do a show with all

3590
03:05:15,321 --> 03:05:19,270
candle light.
Just a small candle light.

3591
03:05:19,330 --> 03:05:23,210
I had those fake little channels,
but someone overload the mother fucker.

3592
03:05:23,660 --> 03:05:28,010
Your host was badly wire.
Badly wired.

3593
03:05:28,190 --> 03:05:32,240
Yes.
I wasn't engaged in that job.

3594
03:05:32,710 --> 03:05:35,300
so listen,
I can understand the,

3595
03:05:35,540 --> 03:05:39,040
you know,
dealing with the unexpected.

3596
03:05:39,090 --> 03:05:41,360
You had to work with them.
I know what you're saying.

3597
03:05:41,370 --> 03:05:44,550
And electricity and weird,
badly wired houses.

3598
03:05:45,210 --> 03:05:47,540
Um,
we've got a great partnership though.

3599
03:05:47,940 --> 03:05:49,790
No,
you guys are an interesting group.

3600
03:05:49,990 --> 03:05:52,220
Really.
Are two of you together seem to work

3601
03:05:52,221 --> 03:05:54,080
well.
drove me out.

3602
03:05:54,260 --> 03:05:57,200
Why is that not a fucking thing?
There's two things.

3603
03:05:57,201 --> 03:05:58,860
A bali,
I go on gun.

3604
03:05:59,690 --> 03:06:00,680
Three things.
One,

3605
03:06:00,681 --> 03:06:02,420
I can't find a pack of cigarettes.
Oh,

3606
03:06:02,430 --> 03:06:05,990
he gave you fucking 400 cigarettes.
He did.

3607
03:06:06,390 --> 03:06:07,710
Alright.
Jesus christ,

3608
03:06:07,890 --> 03:06:09,780
he's got a carton in there.
Good.

3609
03:06:09,950 --> 03:06:12,830
He's been fucking someone in Mexico.
He won't talk about it.

3610
03:06:12,831 --> 03:06:17,810
So he keeps talking.
He keeps coming back from Mexico every

3611
03:06:17,811 --> 03:06:19,400
two weeks.
Listen,

3612
03:06:19,450 --> 03:06:22,550
this is duty free.
Is this a family friendly podcast or

3613
03:06:22,551 --> 03:06:24,020
something?
Not Anymore.

3614
03:06:26,480 --> 03:06:30,920
A fuck.
Now I can't remember the goddamn cast.

3615
03:06:31,040 --> 03:06:32,300
Swap,
cast,

3616
03:06:32,360 --> 03:06:33,193
swap,
cast.

3617
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:35,390
I can't do it here because you do this
live.

3618
03:06:35,730 --> 03:06:40,730
When we do podcasts,
a lot of people are drinking and they

3619
03:06:41,031 --> 03:06:42,410
say shit.
They go,

3620
03:06:42,470 --> 03:06:43,460
oh,
fuck did.

3621
03:06:43,461 --> 03:06:46,550
I mentioned his name.
So we edit everything,

3622
03:06:46,970 --> 03:06:51,970
but if there's two comedians that both
have podcasts doing a podcast together,

3623
03:06:53,960 --> 03:06:56,160
it should be a swap cast where you both

3624
03:06:56,160 --> 03:06:57,840
put it out.
Two birds.

3625
03:06:57,841 --> 03:06:58,674
One stone.
Yeah.

3626
03:06:58,680 --> 03:07:00,210
That's a good move.
Yeah,

3627
03:07:00,510 --> 03:07:03,720
and I've been pitching this since I've
been doing it.

3628
03:07:03,750 --> 03:07:05,190
Well,
you could take this one if you want.

3629
03:07:05,370 --> 03:07:06,970
Well,
there's probably some content going.

3630
03:07:07,030 --> 03:07:08,550
Oh,
stan hope already did it.

3631
03:07:08,551 --> 03:07:10,860
No,
I'm saying you should steal that idea.

3632
03:07:11,310 --> 03:07:14,040
Well,
I think that a can't do it with you.

3633
03:07:14,090 --> 03:07:14,580
Whoa,
whoa.

3634
03:07:14,580 --> 03:07:17,020
We definitely could do it with me.
You could definitely take.

3635
03:07:17,030 --> 03:07:18,930
We'll give you a copy of it.
I think that,

3636
03:07:18,990 --> 03:07:22,200
uh,
I think regardless of how many people

3637
03:07:22,201 --> 03:07:24,900
are listening,
whether it's 10 or a million or 10

3638
03:07:24,900 --> 03:07:25,733
million,
who gives a shit,

3639
03:07:26,820 --> 03:07:28,730
it should.
Everybody was just sort of like

3640
03:07:28,770 --> 03:07:30,240
distributed,
you know,

3641
03:07:30,570 --> 03:07:32,790
the whole.
The beautiful thing about podcasts is

3642
03:07:32,791 --> 03:07:35,130
that everybody can get them for four
days and it doesn't,

3643
03:07:35,131 --> 03:07:40,050
it doesn't hurt me to give you the copy
of our show.

3644
03:07:40,260 --> 03:07:41,550
and you know,
it shouldn't hurt you.

3645
03:07:41,550 --> 03:07:43,680
It's not,
it's all I want.

3646
03:07:44,010 --> 03:07:45,900
I want people to listen to your show
because I listened to it.

3647
03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:51,160
Like there's plenty of that creeped me
out whether I listened that you had the

3648
03:07:51,571 --> 03:07:55,440
time to listen to a podcast that degas
shit out,

3649
03:07:55,441 --> 03:07:56,580
man.
I got time.

3650
03:07:56,581 --> 03:07:59,190
I just don't waste it.
I get sHit done.

3651
03:07:59,191 --> 03:08:02,100
I know that.
I realized if I didn't drink,

3652
03:08:02,101 --> 03:08:06,420
I'd have eight more hours in every day.
We have sat in the fun house in bisbee

3653
03:08:06,421 --> 03:08:10,980
and look at god and like look to joe
rogan's activity on a spreadsheet and

3654
03:08:10,981 --> 03:08:13,110
try to work out when it is your
sleeping.

3655
03:08:13,640 --> 03:08:15,240
You know,
we're like high on a minute.

3656
03:08:15,270 --> 03:08:17,610
He's doing this,
this and this happened.

3657
03:08:17,640 --> 03:08:20,160
But even if you did,
I'm telling you,

3658
03:08:20,161 --> 03:08:22,590
it's just seems way more impressive than
it is.

3659
03:08:22,970 --> 03:08:25,380
It's not that impressive.
Because like most days,

3660
03:08:25,381 --> 03:08:28,740
like jamie and I do a podcast,
we worked for three hours maximum.

3661
03:08:28,950 --> 03:08:32,220
He works more than me.
He worked four and a half and we're

3662
03:08:32,221 --> 03:08:34,530
done.
And we do that like three days a week.

3663
03:08:34,830 --> 03:08:36,810
And that's it.
So there's a podcast right?

3664
03:08:36,811 --> 03:08:38,760
And Then,
then there's the,

3665
03:08:39,170 --> 03:08:42,720
the fake research that goes into finding
podcast guests,

3666
03:08:42,930 --> 03:08:44,880
which is just really just shit I'm
interested in.

3667
03:08:44,881 --> 03:08:46,320
I never think like,
wow,

3668
03:08:46,321 --> 03:08:47,450
I've got to fuck.
He's good.

3669
03:08:47,820 --> 03:08:48,750
No.
Who's that?

3670
03:08:49,230 --> 03:08:51,090
Who is this?
He's a character.

3671
03:08:51,091 --> 03:08:52,750
you're going to come in and a wig?
No,

3672
03:08:53,190 --> 03:08:56,850
we're cool.
If you had rat radley balko on yet.

3673
03:08:57,290 --> 03:08:58,150
Uh,
andy kaufman,

3674
03:08:58,151 --> 03:09:01,640
he used to work for a police and now
he's huffington post.

3675
03:09:02,310 --> 03:09:06,540
he's the guy that gets,
he's an investigative journalist that

3676
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:11,600
does all the cops that stopped people
and bust them and steal their shit.

3677
03:09:13,030 --> 03:09:14,550
He wrote,
he wrote a book last year.

3678
03:09:14,551 --> 03:09:17,400
The rise of the warrior cop.
Oh yeah.

3679
03:09:17,401 --> 03:09:18,420
Okay.
Yeah.

3680
03:09:18,421 --> 03:09:19,410
No,
I have that book,

3681
03:09:19,411 --> 03:09:19,800
man.

3682
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:21,450
Right?
He's fucking brilliant.

3683
03:09:21,540 --> 03:09:22,560
Yeah.
I have that book.

3684
03:09:22,860 --> 03:09:26,610
That's when I was books that I started
and then I just got distracted and never

3685
03:09:26,611 --> 03:09:27,650
finished it.
Get a myth.

3686
03:09:27,660 --> 03:09:30,430
Fucking unbelievable.
It's not even their fault.

3687
03:09:31,200 --> 03:09:33,510
That's the same thing we were talking
about earlier.

3688
03:09:33,511 --> 03:09:38,511
And I really believe in my office,
no motivated algae about a technology

3689
03:09:39,181 --> 03:09:42,780
progresses and as long as people stay
alive and you can feed them,

3690
03:09:42,950 --> 03:09:45,240
there is no famine,
there's no diseases.

3691
03:09:45,480 --> 03:09:47,100
Technology's going to continue to
progress.

3692
03:09:47,730 --> 03:09:52,730
I think that like the same thing happens
With like enforcing the law,

3693
03:09:53,530 --> 03:09:54,350
whether it comes

3694
03:09:54,350 --> 03:09:58,810
or trying to make money or whatever it
is that people pursue.

3695
03:09:58,811 --> 03:10:03,340
They tried to improve upon whatever
results they've had the previous

3696
03:10:03,341 --> 03:10:05,020
trimester,
semester,

3697
03:10:05,021 --> 03:10:06,490
year,
quarter,

3698
03:10:06,491 --> 03:10:09,040
whatever the fuck it is.
It's just an inherent part of being a

3699
03:10:09,041 --> 03:10:11,770
person.
So if it's about busting people,

3700
03:10:12,040 --> 03:10:14,950
you want a bus more fudging people.
It's just,

3701
03:10:14,970 --> 03:10:17,170
it's a game,
it becomes an busting.

3702
03:10:17,171 --> 03:10:20,500
You becomes a game and as soon as it
like a wind loss,

3703
03:10:20,650 --> 03:10:24,490
then you're getting people that are
addicted to like winning in football or

3704
03:10:24,491 --> 03:10:28,720
baseball or fucking whatever else it is.
Or dancing with the stars.

3705
03:10:29,020 --> 03:10:30,830
When is dancing?
Why?

3706
03:10:30,870 --> 03:10:34,000
Why?
That's a competition.

3707
03:10:34,990 --> 03:10:37,750
For years people have not been judged
for their next.

3708
03:10:38,420 --> 03:10:43,310
No one would watch it and it's no shit.
No one would watch it until it became a

3709
03:10:43,311 --> 03:10:45,050
competition.
It should be.

3710
03:10:45,300 --> 03:10:46,400
That's right.
As one of your pins.

3711
03:10:46,850 --> 03:10:49,360
Yeah.
Everything's one of our bits.

3712
03:10:49,370 --> 03:10:53,910
I know the bots,
the bots being uh,

3713
03:10:54,230 --> 03:10:58,850
when we've been doing it this long,
you realize you're just doing an old

3714
03:10:58,851 --> 03:11:00,560
bit.
Yeah.

3715
03:11:00,950 --> 03:11:04,010
In a way.
I mean how many coffees something you

3716
03:11:04,011 --> 03:11:07,760
thought of before and now you're saying
it different on a podcast in a

3717
03:11:07,761 --> 03:11:09,680
conversational way and then you go,

3718
03:11:10,050 --> 03:11:12,790
yeah.
And even in the most original thought,

3719
03:11:12,791 --> 03:11:14,290
there's still like a rhythm to it,
right?

3720
03:11:14,291 --> 03:11:16,540
There's still that rhythm of three that
we all follow.

3721
03:11:16,780 --> 03:11:21,780
If for some reason works well because
you're deaf now I don't know if it's

3722
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:25,270
genetics or real,
whatever it is,

3723
03:11:25,360 --> 03:11:26,400
whatever it is.
I mean,

3724
03:11:26,710 --> 03:11:28,600
of course I know gen x are real,
but I don't know.

3725
03:11:28,601 --> 03:11:33,280
It's like expressing ideas through jokes
from one parent to child.

3726
03:11:33,281 --> 03:11:36,940
I don't knoW if that's possible,
but people believe it is that they

3727
03:11:36,941 --> 03:11:41,650
believe that it's possible that memes
and even racism might be passed from.

3728
03:11:41,651 --> 03:11:43,240
And I don'T mean memes like internet
means,

3729
03:11:43,241 --> 03:11:46,180
but like ideas like ideas might be able
to be passed,

3730
03:11:46,690 --> 03:11:51,690
like the reaction and contemplation and
solution of an idea might be passed from

3731
03:11:55,001 --> 03:11:59,800
parent to child where the child almost
immediately goes to the same resolution

3732
03:11:59,801 --> 03:12:02,260
or solution that the parent did almost
instinctively.

3733
03:12:02,410 --> 03:12:04,060
Like they have it programmed their
genome,

3734
03:12:04,210 --> 03:12:09,210
but it's really controversial.
You've seen that footage of the monkeys

3735
03:12:09,581 --> 03:12:11,040
with assault and.
Yeah,

3736
03:12:11,041 --> 03:12:13,160
that's exactly what that is,
is it is.

3737
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:14,950
Yeah.
And a lot of ways they've done it with

3738
03:12:14,951 --> 03:12:19,930
mice where they figured out a way to
have a citrus smell and they would spray

3739
03:12:19,931 --> 03:12:22,180
the citrus smell,
it would smell it and they would shock

3740
03:12:22,181 --> 03:12:25,900
their feet.
and the mice offspring who did not

3741
03:12:25,901 --> 03:12:30,100
experience the same experiment still,
when they would blast the citrus smell,

3742
03:12:30,220 --> 03:12:32,300
they would have some sort of a,
um,

3743
03:12:32,301 --> 03:12:35,680
a reaction,
like a stress reaction to like something

3744
03:12:35,681 --> 03:12:36,514
coming at them.

3745
03:12:37,240 --> 03:12:38,800
The same video last night.

3746
03:12:43,330 --> 03:12:45,200
oh,
who is the original?

3747
03:12:45,201 --> 03:12:46,490
How dare you?
It's not me.

3748
03:12:46,690 --> 03:12:49,580
It's definitely not me.
I don't know who I got it from.

3749
03:12:50,600 --> 03:12:51,433
It's been,

3750
03:12:53,260 --> 03:12:58,220
it probably was like serious originally.
I was going to say stern,

3751
03:12:58,221 --> 03:13:00,800
but uh,
how dare you.

3752
03:13:00,820 --> 03:13:05,820
Was it a stern originated everything?
Hey now or that was that the guy from

3753
03:13:06,171 --> 03:13:08,090
Larry Sanders.
Those sandals.

3754
03:13:09,080 --> 03:13:11,270
Yeah,
that guy was crazy.

3755
03:13:11,271 --> 03:13:14,510
He is awesome.
He had a go.

3756
03:13:14,540 --> 03:13:15,690
I'm traveling,
so

3757
03:13:18,060 --> 03:13:22,520
I have to drive really fast.
Got

3758
03:13:25,550 --> 03:13:28,180
brian hannigan.
Tell the people how to follow you on the

3759
03:13:28,400 --> 03:13:30,320
twitter,
the instagram.

3760
03:13:31,150 --> 03:13:32,750
Brian hannigan.
I'm not done.

3761
03:13:32,751 --> 03:13:34,460
Doug.
Stan hope you relaxed.

3762
03:13:34,461 --> 03:13:36,680
We're not at a time.
There was no network here.

3763
03:13:37,130 --> 03:13:40,200
There's no one to yell at you about
stiff verse at heart.

3764
03:13:40,250 --> 03:13:42,440
I can't hear you.
What was that?

3765
03:13:42,441 --> 03:13:44,060
And again,
I am brian hennigan.

3766
03:13:44,061 --> 03:13:47,270
I missed her hennigan on twitter and
instagram.

3767
03:13:48,320 --> 03:13:49,920
And you have a book coming out on
understand.

3768
03:13:49,960 --> 03:13:53,440
I have a novel that I just know it's a
republication of uh,

3769
03:13:53,480 --> 03:13:58,480
my first novel that was published in the
uk a while ago and it got great reviews

3770
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:00,310
and it was never published in the u.

3771
03:14:00,310 --> 03:14:02,120
S beautiful.
He,

3772
03:14:02,121 --> 03:14:03,290
uh,
it's fiction.

3773
03:14:03,320 --> 03:14:07,490
I never read fiction and I tried to read
his book,

3774
03:14:07,491 --> 03:14:11,360
but I know him.
So I'm listening to the first 30,

3775
03:14:11,361 --> 03:14:16,361
40 pages in his voice and then then I
got past that and it was funny as shit.

3776
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:24,280
So I went to his apartment.
I was staying there when he was away and

3777
03:14:24,681 --> 03:14:28,310
I just left it with the last three pages
unread.

3778
03:14:28,490 --> 03:14:33,490
Like I read the whole book and became so
disinterested in three pages.

3779
03:14:35,300 --> 03:14:37,670
I left it open like that.
He didn't notice.

3780

Unfortunately,

3785
03:14:59,890 --> 03:15:02,540

Why don't you just try to be one of

3786
03:15:02,541 --> 03:15:07,330
those intercontinental motherfuckers.
Get yourself a fat spread out here and

3787
03:15:07,331 --> 03:15:10,010

make your life.

3788
03:15:10,030 --> 03:15:14,150
we were waiting for someone to move out
of our fucking rent control apartment

3789
03:15:14,151 --> 03:15:16,250
building.
That's all well and good.

3790
03:15:16,460 --> 03:15:19,060
BuT I think in the interest of,
in the,

3791
03:15:19,061 --> 03:15:21,350
in the interest of a god,
I would have,

3794
03:15:30,021 --> 03:15:34,640

could be some sort of a local dive like

3795
03:15:34,641 --> 03:15:39,230
shaq place where people can go and stay
for the comics to us are guys who've

3796
03:15:39,260 --> 03:15:41,720
only been doing it for 15 years.

3797
03:15:41,780 --> 03:15:42,860
exactly.
That's what I'm talking about.
