1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
On that.
Right when we go live,

2
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,063
dad

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,280
is over 10,000 Viking fans with the
Viking clap there.

4
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:35,800
Icelandic fans

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,280
and that is uh,
a coordinated clap.

6
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,410
There could not be done.
The United States of America,

7
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,150
ladies and gentleman,
we got a little too much independence.

8
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:48,660
Thank you know going on over here.
Can you imagine if we can we have that

9
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:51,570
kind of organization?
We could do a clap in America.

10
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:52,530
Clap.
Awesome.

11
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,550
Okay.
A group Haka.

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,870
Why can't we do that?
How can we watch the Haka we watched

13
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:01,560
like those awesome Samoan dudes.
Are They Samoan that are doing that?

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,870
That is New Zealand.
New Zealand.

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,420
Yeah.
That is one of the dopest fucking ward

16
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:09,330
dances the world's ever known and it's
going on right now.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,030
Like it's not some Viking shit that they
forgot about did.

18
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,270
They probably used to do,
but everybody who did it got slaughtered

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,570
or died off or they didn't tell their
grandchildren because I didn't want him

20
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:21,570
carrying on the way.
This is some real shit.

21
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,060
They're doing it right now at a soccer
game.

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,060
Soccer's we're placing more,
right?

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,840
Yeah.
This is going on.

24
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,590
Yeah.
It's a good chance for your country to

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,840
go fuck up another country.
Yeah.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,980
And you,
uh,

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,140
nobody has to die.
You still get to do the war cry.

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,040
Yeah.
Mike Schmidt

29
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,600
and the ladies and gentlemen pull this
straight up man.

30
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,440
Oh,
okay.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,273
So,
uh,

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,590
let me tell everybody how this podcast
got started and why I'm,

33
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:53,210
why I wanted to talk to you cause I'm,
Mike Works,

34
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,830
the comedy store,
uh,

35
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,180
seemed like very cool guy and a one day
we're hanging out in the back patio and

36
00:01:59,181 --> 00:01:59,751
you know,
like,

37
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:01,850
uh,
all the employees of the comedy store,

38
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,290
it's like kind of a hang,
you know,

39
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,060
it's an interesting place to work,
right?

40
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,290
Yeah.
It's just to hang.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,700
And during the course of a,
this hang you started telling me about

42
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,210
your past before you worked at the
comedy store and uh,

43
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,310
you started telling me some really
disturbing shit that you saw in the

44
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:22,490
criminal justice system while while you
were working there.

45
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:26,060
And I was like,
this is a fascinating subject and uh,

46
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,830
let's,
let's talk about it on a podcast.

47
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,970
So here we are.
Yep.

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,470
Yep.
I figured why not?

49
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,960
It's fucked up so I may as well tell
people.

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,650
Yeah.
Will you tell him so much?

51
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:39,050
He did for 10 years,
so I was a criminal defense attorney for

52
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:42,890
about 10 years.
I was for the first year or two in

53
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:45,800
central Wisconsin and then I moved down
to Dane County,

54
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:48,410
Wisconsin,
which is where Madison is,

55
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:50,030
you know,
University of Wisconsin,

56
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:53,120
all that fun stuff.
It's the capital of the state.

57
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,180
Shout out to my friend Doug during
powerful.

58
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:57,500
Doug Darren.
Yeah,

59
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,460
he lives there.
Yeah.

60
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,250
It's a great comedy club.

61
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,510
Yes it does.
It really does.

62
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,920
It's an awesome town.
It's a very liberal town,

63
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,250
very liberal town.
And you would think that because it's

64
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:14,251
very liberal that black people are
treated well there and it is absolutely

65
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:17,950
not the case.
It is the like if you're black in

66
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,920
America,
I mean you've seen the studies,

67
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,380
you've seen the statistics,
you've seen riots,

68
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,890
like things are not good,
you're not being treated well.

69
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,900
And you would think that the worst place
to be would be where you see riots

70
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,950
happening like Ferguson,
but actually it's Madison,

71
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:40,510
Wisconsin,
no place our black people more poor in

72
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,910
relation to the white people around them
than Madison,

73
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:43,870
Wisconsin.
No.

74
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:48,871
Where else do black children get
arrested more often in comparison with

75
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,910
white children then Madison,
Wisconsin.

76
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,160
You would think at Birmingham,
Alabama.

77
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,620
You would think,
where are those pictures that I saw

78
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,040
people getting hoses turned on him or
dog sent home.

79
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,540
I bet that's where they treat black
folks like,

80
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,560
Shit.
No,

81
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,210
it's Madison,
Wisconsin.

82
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,550
What do you,
what do you think is causing that mean?

83
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,460
Why is this one area in your assessment
from working there for 10 years?

84
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,640
I'm like,
why is it like this?

85
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,680
There's,
well,

86
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:18,160
the,
I mean there's a ton of different

87
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:22,570
factors and all the factors boiled down
to racism.

88
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,230
Uh,
I know it's kind of condescending for me

89
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,770
to be a white guy from the midwest.
Colin racism on everybody,

90
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,130
but I'm just going to tell you what I've
observed and you know what the numbers

91
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,730
show because the thing is that you can't
argue with this statistics.

92
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,470
If this ever came down to an argument
about whether or not these numbers are

93
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:43,810
fair,
these people are being treated fairly.

94
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,020
We know where they are,
you know they're,

95
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,750
they're in prison.
We can point to the actual people.

96
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,120
They could raise their hands if they
wanted to and say,

97
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,330
but I'm sorry.
I think really what's important,

98
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:00,390
one of the things you pointed out was in
specific crimes where a white guy and a

99
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:03,490
black guy with no record did the exact
same thing.

100
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:05,610
The difference in punishment between the
white car,

101
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,290
the black guy,
because this is so if you want to count

102
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,130
numbers of people that have been
arrested,

103
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,700
I think there's a possibility that it
runs into that quagmire.

104
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,770
Well,
you know how many black people are

105
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:19,210
there,
how many white people are there?

106
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:21,220
Where's the,
are they in bad neighborhoods where

107
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,440
these things are taking place?
But what you're talking about is the

108
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,080
exact same crime.
Yup.

109
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,530
So you can really,
did you really see the obvious contrast?

110
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,403
Yeah.
Yeah.

111
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,540
Um,
the best example is burglary.

112
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,810
So burglary's a crime that there's
multiple stages to burglary.

113
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,340
Uh,
there's people who are very good at

114
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,840
burglary who will,
you know,

115
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,880
knock on a house and announced
themselves,

116
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:49,780
say eight cathy,
just to try and avoid being charged with

117
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:52,420
burglary under the statute.
Just the way it's worded.

118
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,240
But teenagers do burglary at different
way.

119
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,070
They wait until somebody is out of town
that they know,

120
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,280
uh,
and they robbed their parents' house and

121
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:04,130
they'll take their playstations and
they'll take their liquor and everything

122
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,370
and they get caught.
They'll usually do a couple of them and

123
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:11,210
they'll get caught in a group.
And if that's your first trip into the

124
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:15,140
justice system,
you are probably in Dane County,

125
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,960
you're probably going to get a deferred
prosecution agreement.

126
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,380
And if you keep your nose clean,
you'll get an expunction,

127
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,410
which is where the judge says,
I don't think the community would be

128
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:27,080
harmed.
And I think you would be helped by

129
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,070
making it.

130
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,860
Like this never happened.
So the police can keep a report of it,

131
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:33,350
but nobody will ever know.
So

132
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,580
the black kids don't get the offer of
expunction right out of the gates the

133
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,690
the white kids do.
And then when they fuck up and they do

134
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,050
because they are 19 and a lot of the
white kids are doing or stealing for

135
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:52,700
heroin,
um,

136
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,110
you know,
like,

137
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,690
I don't want to sensationalize it not,
but as to what you do.

138
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,350
So they'll steal for that.
They'll get popped again or they'll get

139
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,800
popped for curfew.
And now the deferred prosecution

140
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:07,070
agreement is polled and so they're
technically convicted of a felony.

141
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,750
At that point,
the white kids will still have options

142
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,420
of saying like,
let me give this another shot.

143
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,140
I'll plead to more offenses,
I'll plead the more the bail jumpings

144
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:20,750
let's haggle,
let's tag along what we're going to do.

145
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,810
Because they've already entered a
conviction or entered a plea on the

146
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,620
record to the felony for burglary.
So they still have options.

147
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
And at the end of it,
they're going to get probation.

148
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,780
They'll,
they might get six months conditional

149
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:35,870
time in jail,
but they're going to get probation.

150
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,080
And the black kids who fuck up the same
way,

151
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:43,400
who were charged with the same offense.
In my experience and what I mean what

152
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:45,530
everybody else notices.
They go to prison,

153
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,100
they just off to prison.
So white burglars in there early,

154
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,940
you know,
late teens,

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
early twenties,
conviction,

156
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,990
deferred prosecution,
possibility of expunction then still

157
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,670
fuck up.
And then they get probation,

158
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,250
black kids,
one chance prison,

159
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,360
and once they go to prison,
you don't really get out of that system

160
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:12,380
very long because they just keep
catching you up on probation or parole

161
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:16,010
violations.
And so that's just one example where

162
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,460
same number of convictions,
you know,

163
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,000
whether or not it's a kid with no
convictions are a bunch of convictions.

164
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,620
The determining factor was the race of
the kid because they're both poor.

165
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,160
You know,
the white burglar defendants and the

166
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,450
black burglar defendants are generally
both poor because if your parents have

167
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:37,760
money,
you just pay the restitution and you

168
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,890
kind of walk,
whoa.

169
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,240
Not In every case,
but when there's money over the barrel,

170
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,580
when you can pay the restitution in a
criminal case,

171
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:51,320
it's such a rare thing that the
prosecution will bend over backwards to

172
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:54,530
help you get that money to the people
that you fucked over.

173
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,290
And that's all they would have to do is
pay the equal amount.

174
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,730
And they could skate.
No,

175
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,530
no,
they don't skate completely.

176
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,590
But since so few people ever get their
money back from the prosecuted,

177
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,340
you know from the prosecution and the
crime,

178
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,580
anytime you can put the money up they
will bend over backwards for me.

179
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:15,930
So for a theft case in like,
like that,

180
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,540
yeah,
you could conceivably not be punished

181
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,990
for breaking into someone's house and
stealing something if you pay them for

182
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:22,770
it back.

183
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,330
Yeah.
If you could act a breaking in,

184
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,580
you won't be penalized for that.
That seems crazy.

185
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,500
Well,
I mean if you can pay for it,

186
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,700
like think I put yourself in the shoes
of a prosecutor where day in day out you

187
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,920
convict people crimes and you give them
time.

188
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,670
But then there's these victims and all
they ever get to do is read a report.

189
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,190
All they ever get to do is sit in a
chair and say,

190
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:45,570
you really screwed me on this one day.
And then a lot of times the defendant

191
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:49,680
doesn't even fucking look at them.
And so they never get to come with a win

192
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:54,270
for their victims and paying restitution
is a win for the victims.

193
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,220
Right.
So you can't ignore that.

194
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,800
No.
I mean I totally get it from a rational

195
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,870
sense,
but it just seems fucked.

196
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,390
I mean that literally is buying your way
out of jail.

197
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,510
If you look at the,
yeah,

198
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,470
if you look at the difference between
someone who figures out a way to come up

199
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:10,080
with the money to pay for it or they
have the money to pay for and they were

200
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:14,460
just stealing for a kick or just to be a
piece of shit versus someone who has no

201
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:17,310
money.
The only difference being is that the

202
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,080
one person is able to come up with some
cash.

203
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,370
That's,
that's crazy.

204
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,290
Yeah.
But of course if you're,

205
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,130
I mean,
the thing is if the charges are already

206
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,130
filed,
you're going to have to plead to

207
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:27,810
something.
Are you going to have to do a deferred

208
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,480
prosecution agreement?
But they'll make it as as easy as

209
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:34,920
possible.
So when you were working there and you

210
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:35,760
observe this,
I mean,

211
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:40,761
you were there for 10 years doing this,
when did it really start to sink in that

212
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,770
this was sort of an impossible system
and you didn't want to be a part of it?

213
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,873
Uh,
there.

214
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,380
So in order to combat,
uh,

215
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,410
I guess the view that people were
becoming increasingly more violent,

216
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,830
Dane county did this thing called the
Special Investigations Unit and the

217
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,110
Special Investigations Unit was
supposedly a race blind selection of the

218
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,380
10 most dangerous,
uh,

219
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,470
individuals in Dane county most likely
to re offend and hurt somebody else.

220
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,670
And they staffed it with the Department
of Justice and probation and parole and

221
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,940
some other people that we didn't know
that they staffed it about.

222
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,000
Um,
and so they just discussed these issues

223
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:24,210
and the sheriff's department and the US
Attorney's office and the,

224
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,960
and they made the list of these people
that they thought were the most

225
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,230
dangerous in Dane County.
And then they summoned them all to a

226
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,630
meeting where they threatened him and
they said,

227
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:34,464
hey,
if you,

228
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,350
if you step out of line,
we're going to fucking max you out on

229
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:41,040
everything.
So if you spit on the sidewalk ticket,

230
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,010
if you disorderly conduct,
we're going to hit you with disorderly

231
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:46,920
conduct as a repeater and try to throw
you in prison for it.

232
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,010
So you cock off even a little bit.
You're taking the ride.

233
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,480
And also,
by the way,

234
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:54,100
we have some services.
So here's a place where you can apply

235
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:57,400
for a job.
And they were all black.

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That was when I knew there was no
fucking point to this because in Dane

237
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,620
county,
there are like 4.6% of the population or

238
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:13,150
something is black.
They can't all like the top 10 most

239
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:16,240
dangerous people in Dane county are not
all black.

240
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,720
I know this because some of the most
dangerous people in Dane county where my

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,390
other clients and they're white and I
was like,

242
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:26,560
I looked at the list,
I'm like,

243
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,230
I got other guys that belong on this
list.

244
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,460
I had a number of people on the list
when it first came out.

245
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,980
And then when they redid the list,
I had a couple more.

246
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,320
And when they redid the list with a new
10,

247
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,113
all black.

248
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,320
So I know black people are not evil.
I know they're normal.

249
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,610
I know they're just like everybody else.
How are they,

250
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,980
you know,
it's cause it's white or black.

251
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,510
The coin flip,
white or black.

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,770
They're telling me it came up 20 times
in a row on heads.

253
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,590
Like random chance doesn't even account
for this.

254
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,080
There's no race blind way to they.
And they told me afterwards,

255
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:06,491
they're like,
no,

256
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,520
we did it in a race blind way.
There's no way you did.

257
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,170
You might have thought you did.
So the system doesn't even understand

258
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,340
how racist it is.

259
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,450
How could they say they're doing it in a
race blind way?

260
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,370
Um,
I mean if you legitimately think through

261
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:23,910
are more dangerous people that were
working under you or that were um,

262
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,760
being represented by you rather.
Why,

263
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,220
I mean,
what was their criteria?

264
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:31,470
What were they judging on?
There was a judging on how many

265
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,140
convictions the violence of the
conviction.

266
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,460
Like what,
what were the criteria?

267
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,960
Well,
it was just a,

268
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,780
yeah,
number of convictions and offense

269
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:41,340
severity.
It's,

270
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,290
they,
they try a lot to figure out a good

271
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,850
metric to predict,
you know,

272
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:46,560
new criminality and it never really
works.

273
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:47,820
It was patterned after

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,950
program that they did in the south.
So it's kind of like they took the names

275
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,280
and birth dates off of bunch of files
and they pass them around and

276
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,910
miraculously every single one of them
was black.

277
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,860
Now numbers wise,
is that possible?

278
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,180
Like is it possible that all the people
that were the top 20 had the most amount

279
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,860
of violent convictions,
the most amount of this,

280
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:15,360
the most amount of that and that was
just,

281
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:17,130
they just happened to be black?
Is that possible?

282
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,180
It is not possible because I had other
clients who beat them.

283
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,490
Right.
You need the criteria.

284
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,760
I've worst people.
Everybody in that courthouse had

285
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:30,000
somebody that was worse than anybody on
that fucking list.

286
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,390
That's insane.
So you're saying like literally the,

287
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:36,960
you could replace the list with white
people that were violent,

288
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:40,500
dangerous criminals and it would be a
better choice.

289
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,670
Absolutely.
The dangerous.

290
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,190
It's so dangerous.
People were not even in the top 10.

291
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,570
Yeah,
yeah,

292
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,440
yeah.
If they wanted,

293
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,130
like if they wanted to know who the
biggest fucking maniacs and that in Dane

294
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,870
county where they could have just asked
the defense attorneys,

295
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,520
we wouldn't have told them.
Right.

296
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,460
But she knew the answers that isn't that
a tricky situation to be in.

297
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,290
Yeah.
I would imagine that.

298
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,170
Um,
it's incredibly stressful being someone

299
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:03,840
who's representing someone who you think
is like a real criminal,

300
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,960
a bad person,
and you have to try to get them off.

301
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,250
Yeah.
That it's,

302
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,170
it's weird.
But the thing is this system only works

303
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,580
if you just come at the other side and
the other side just comes at you because

304
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,800
you've got,
you know,

305
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:23,280
they've got the police behind them.
They've got the fact that they've got a

306
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,230
badge that impresses,
you know,

307
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,910
civilians during the jury trial,
they've got prosecutors who have access

308
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:34,200
to state crime labs.
They're going to come at you and if they

309
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,220
lose,
it's their fault.

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,010
So they have to win these ones.
So,

311
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,250
and the guilty guys give you an
opportunity to practice because you,

312
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,470
if you only took the cases of people who
you thought were innocent,

313
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,730
you would suck when it came time to do
their trial.

314
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,700
Like you got to practice,
you've got to sharpen your clause.

315
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,210
And the best way to do it is,
you know,

316
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,420
when with someone where you know that
they fucking did it and when it clean on

317
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:06,360
technical points because those technical
points like,

318
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,170
you know,
not getting evidence in or when a

319
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:12,480
prosecutor is asking questions during
wild deer,

320
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:16,860
they shouldn't be that type a little,
those little back flips and shit,

321
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,370
those will pay off when you actually
have a client that you don't think did

322
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:21,204
it.

323
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,380
So,
uh,

324
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,590
Ooh,
I understand.

325
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,680
I understand what you're saying and it
sort of your obligation.

326
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,530
And so in that sense,
you almost treat it like it's a game

327
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,750
that you're playing,
like some sort of a technical game.

328
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,980
You have to treat it as a technical game
or you will lose

329
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,930
because is it,
it's something,

330
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:37,890
I mean,
I'd know very,

331
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:40,710
very little about the law in terms of
defending people,

332
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:45,060
but is it something that you think is
like a almost like sort of a chess game?

333
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:48,390
Like you have a bunch of pieces and you
have to manipulate them correctly and

334
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:53,391
you have to be aware of the massive,
massive amounts of things that have been

335
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:57,720
written on each individual subject,
whether individual crime,

336
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,580
what precedents have been set,
how to establish whether or not they're,

337
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:06,090
your client was treated fairly.
And is that based on precedents to,

338
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,381
yeah.
Yeah,

339
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:09,930
there's precedent for everything.
Um,

340
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,050
you know,
346 million people in the country,

341
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:17,010
like they've had some court cases.
So yeah,

342
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:20,370
there's,
you have to know the general progress of

343
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:23,250
how a trial goes.
You have to know when someone can invoke

344
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,950
a right and when they can't invoke a
right time.

345
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:28,860
Limits are kind of important.
Um,

346
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,600
time limits.
Time limits.

347
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,051
Yeah.
Oh,

348
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,130
and it's like how,
like what statute of limitations?

349
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,220
Time limits?
Is that what you mean?

350
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,650
Statute of limitations to,
even if you're in court and you don't

351
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:40,910
object on time.
Yeah,

352
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,290
you're screwed.
Then they have to argue in a different

353
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,290
way to try and get it flipped over.
But there's always arguing.

354
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,380
Right.
Um,

355
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,930
but yeah,
it is a game and it is kind of mental.

356
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,310
Well,
here's an example.

357
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,050
Um,
I did this to a guy,

358
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:56,500
he's now,
um,

359
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,330
he's not a prosecutor there anymore,
but when you go into courtrooms in large

360
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:07,020
areas,
they take their inmates from the in

361
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,360
custody section.
Sometimes there'll be in a jail next to

362
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:12,690
her and they'll bring them from a tunnel
or a little holding cells in the

363
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,270
courthouse.
So they'll bring them in one side of the

364
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:18,960
courtroom and then they'll put the jury
box on the opposite side of the

365
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:23,700
courtroom so that the in custody
defendant doesn't walk past them on the

366
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:24,534
way in and out.

367
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,590
Because if they were to get sentenced
and the jury were sitting there on their

368
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,600
way out,
there may be some choice words.

369
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,540
So they separate the two of them.
Um,

370
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,330
and also because you know,
they're worried about them fleeing or

371
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,660
whatever,
but the net,

372
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,700
the actual effect of that is the
prosecutor's sits closer to the jury box

373
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,600
and they always have a case officer who
sits next to the prosecutor in their

374
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:51,360
dress uniform or they're,
you know,

375
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,530
they're working a form and they look at
the jury and they monitor the jury and

376
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:58,980
they keep their notes and they help them
and they mug and they listened to the

377
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:00,600
entire trial so they know what's going
on.

378
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:04,500
So it's a great asset to them,
but a substantial part of the advantage

379
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:08,730
that they get from having that chair,
having the officer being able to look at

380
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,623
the jury.

381
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,310
Because
think about you sitting in a room and

382
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:16,410
you're trying to figure out what the
fuck is going on.

383
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,170
Maybe it's a knife fight.
Maybe somebody supposedly shot at

384
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:24,171
somebody and a jury and you know,
the witness leans forward and says

385
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,280
something and you don't know if you
should believe him.

386
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,960
So you look to the judge,
judges blank and then you look to the

387
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,500
court reporter and the clerk of courts
blank blank because they don't want you

388
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:37,320
to be able to read them or they're
working on other shit or they're

389
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,300
concentrating on writing what everybody
is saying.

390
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,700
Then you get to the,
you know,

391
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,280
you get to the defense table and there's
the,

392
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,800
you know,
defendant looking guilty as shit as they

393
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:48,420
always do.
Um,

394
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,380
not really,
but,

395
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,490
and then you get to the prosecutor and
the cop and there the cops looking at

396
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:57,150
you and he just gives you an [inaudible]
and there you go.

397
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,690
You've got some validation for your
suspicion that the person was not

398
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:04,200
telling the truth just a little bit.
And that rolls forward from time to

399
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:06,120
time.
Like when you tell jokes on stage,

400
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,680
sometimes you hold for a second and you
fucking look at people and then they

401
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,140
start to laugh.
It's the same shit.

402
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,530
It's just their work in the crowd.
And they don't even know that they're

403
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:23,100
doing it.
But when they lean forward to answer a

404
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,800
question that the prosecutor acid they
want to answer,

405
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,910
or when they lean back because you asked
them a question and they're about to

406
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:33,300
burn you,
their work in the fucking crowd,

407
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,050
they're just working the crowd.
So what I would do is I would show up

408
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,960
early as shit and I would take their
table.

409
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,770
I would just put my shit at their table
because their name's not on the table.

410
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,680
Most juvenile bullshit ever.
I would take the table and I would put

411
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:52,681
all my stuff there and I would make them
ask the judge to move me because that

412
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:57,650
was not an argument that someone who
went to Harvard came to the courthouse

413
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,670
prepared to make cause my opponent that
they did go to Harvard and fuck Harvard

414
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,750
especially,
you know like this is the streets like

415
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:10,540
this is fuck around time.
So I did that just to an horse,

416
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:14,350
him mentally so that when the trial did
start,

417
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,980
he was uncomfortable.
I didn't care if I won or lost that

418
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,560
argument.
I wanted that chair.

419
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,230
I wanted that cheer cause I knew what we
could do.

420
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,710
Looking back at forth that,
those people and just taking them that

421
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:31,120
much further from the physical proximity
of the jury putting us clothes.

422
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:34,330
I wanted it for that reason,
but more so than that.

423
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,870
I just wanted to make him be a fucking
six year old to the judge.

424
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Uh,
that's beautiful movement.

425
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,450
That's an excellent move.
And so it's,

426
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,320
you know,
like it's playing around and it's

427
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,960
definitely,
but it's also the whole system's kind of

428
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,130
juked anyway.
Right?

429
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,710
Well even your best to,
yeah.

430
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,970
I mean the thing is like if I can play
for that advantage and it's not

431
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:05,380
unethical or illegal because I can
explain why that chair is better and why

432
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:08,020
I want it,
then I'm,

433
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,890
I kind of have to play that angle
because I would hate for my client that

434
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,723
day to be like,
well,

435
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,600
so you had a chance to really mind fuck
them before you started and you didn't.

436
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,880
And now I'm convicted.
Right.

437
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,680
Well thanks.
They're not gonna,

438
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,330
you know.
Well,

439
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:27,331
how many guys who are working in your
position have such a clear mindset

440
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:28,090
though?

441
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,270
How many people have sort of punched out
after a while cause they've been doing

442
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,210
it a long time.
Or is that a public misconception that

443
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:36,850
you see in like movies where the,
you know,

444
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:37,311
the,
the,

445
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:38,130
the,
the,

446
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,840
the criminal defendant that gets
assigned by the state doesn't really

447
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:42,970
give a fuck.
Does a half house job and the guy gets

448
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,280
sent up river.
Is that common or is it bullshit?

449
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,120
It's bullshit.
It's bullshit because we all do care.

450
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,730
Um,
we're competitive.

451
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,820
Even if we hate you,
we're going to try to win.

452
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,160
Especially if we hate you.
Like I've pulled like some of my best

453
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:05,161
moves all the time for people that I
loathed because it was the hardest move

454
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,100
to pull and it would be the biggest win.
And I,

455
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,110
you know,
like it doesn't matter how you feel

456
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:12,680
about the person.
Do you like winning?

457
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,380
I keep winning.
Like when you see somebody and they want

458
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:21,220
seven years and you go fuck you three,
you don't say fuck you,

459
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,590
but you just think you want seven years
for this shit.

460
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,130
Seven years of someone's life,
you maniac.

461
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,560
I don't care.
I don't even want this guy out,

462
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:30,640
but seven,
no.

463
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,870
So then you work on an argument,
so they after work you can tell

464
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:39,871
everybody that the prosecution asked for
seven and you got him to wow.

465
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,940
Because yeah,
winning is its own reward.

466
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,440
I've never heard a lawyer put it quite
like that,

467
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:46,550
like that.
Honestly,

468
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,130
you know,
we've talked about it before on the

469
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:53,690
podcast where I think that there's a
real problem with cops arresting

470
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:58,070
criminals and not that they shouldn't,
but there's a real problem in that it

471
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,500
becomes a game.
Like you're trying to,

472
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:03,890
when you're trying to catch people for
doing things and you're trying to lock

473
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:07,340
them up and when you're trying to win
because that is a win.

474
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,450
You know,
if you get someone,

475
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,030
you lock them up,
you arrest them,

476
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,480
you catch them,
they get convicted,

477
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,190
they go up river.
I sat him up river,

478
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:16,050
I went and that is an absolute,
it's,

479
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,760
there's a,
there's a certain amount of what,

480
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,460
what we've sort of developed all
throughout high school years and junior

481
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:27,230
high school and whatever.
Kids play sports and we developed this

482
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:30,050
winning mentality.
The game is to be one,

483
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,150
you know,
whether it's a game of pool or lawn

484
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:33,950
darts are fucking basketball.

485
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,070
People are always trying to win.
And when you have people that have

486
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:39,470
raised in some of the most intense
moments of their life,

487
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:41,600
especially if you're,
you've been involved in competitive

488
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:44,480
sports,
like if you've been on a championship

489
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:48,770
baseball team or something like that,
you go from that and your,

490
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,620
your next experiences in life or being a
police officer,

491
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,700
you're going to definitely take that
sports mindset and apply it to chasing

492
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:58,370
down criminals.
And it could be good and it can be bad.

493
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:03,110
But the problem is when people start
justifying certain things like planting

494
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:06,620
evidence and doing things along those
lines in order to get a conviction

495
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,740
because they want to win,
that's when shit gets really,

496
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,220
really scary because someone has an
incredible amount of power.

497
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,480
And if someone is doing something to
make you look more guilty,

498
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:20,330
just so that they can win.
That's scary.

499
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,870
Yeah.
Um,

500
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,250
when people were upset about the New
England patriots being accused of

501
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:26,830
cheating.

502
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,810
Yeah.
Deflate gate to was Jamie,

503
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,940
can you explain that?
Because I don't necessarily understand

504
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:31,210
it.

505
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,020
Uh,
they just,

506
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,500
during the nfl,
I think it was the championship game a

507
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,490
couple of years ago,
during the,

508
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:40,810
before the game,
a trainer supposedly had let some air

509
00:25:40,811 --> 00:25:42,760
out of the ball,
which would make it easier to grip and

510
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:43,830
throw and catch.
Now,

511
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,210
that's what I don't understand it does
that been proven?

512
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,680
That had happened that it's easier to
catch a ball.

513
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,350
And there's other NFL quarterbacks I've
heard recently that admit to over

514
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,240
inflating a ball for the similar
reasons.

515
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:00,260
It's just preference on how to grip a
boss and my baseball players do stuff to

516
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:01,450
baseball,
but it's,

517
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,300
pitchers aren't allowed to scuff it,
but they,

518
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,270
they beat up a ball so that it's not
brand new and slippery at all.

519
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,540
This is why I got confused,
but hasn't had been proven or am I wrong

520
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:13,000
that it's like there's no like
measurable.

521
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,540
I think it was like the amount that it
actually was for there was like a 0.0018

522
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,320
amount of air selected.
That's an immeasurable amount of dif.

523
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,330
I really don't think it was.
Uh,

524
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,860
it was so,
it was bullshit.

525
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,840
Bullshit chair most part yet.
And it still isn't,

526
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:29,870
it's just that they want to win and if
he wants to win in this case,

527
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,630
yeah,
that's what it is like and then uh,

528
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,210
cause they couldn't get,
I'm very much on when they were

529
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:37,340
listening to everybody's place cause
they were,

530
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,400
they were reviewing everyone else's
plays in intercepting their

531
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:42,050
communications.
How are they doing that?

532
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,250
Radios and that's illegal.

533
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,120
It's not illegal depending on the state
that you're in,

534
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,790
but it's frowned upon.
It's,

535
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,490
that's unethical.
The teams are not supposed to be

536
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,950
eavesdropping on the play calls.
Right.

537
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,420
So they were taping them to videotaping
practices and catching hand signals.

538
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,560
Oh really?
Yeah.

539
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,350
And Dis ciphering hand signals like
fucking enemies.

540
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:04,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

541
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,930
Wow.
That's like some World War II Japanese

542
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,950
like code type Shit,
right?

543
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,680
Yeah.
That's why they hold up this big ass

544
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:12,640
science now with like five different
pictures.

545
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:16,330
Your decoy guys given fake hand signals.
There's all kinds of things going on in

546
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,720
that center.
Subterfuge.

547
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,243
Yeah.
Danger.

548
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:20,821
Yeah.
Wow.

549
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:23,490
That's crazy.
So it's like the cops are kind of like

550
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:26,610
the New England patriots,
like they're going to win anyway.

551
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,640
Why do you cheat?
You're going to win because the Patriots

552
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:31,800
were going to win almost all of those
games anyway.

553
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,820
But if they don't,
the planning of evidence and stuff like

554
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,980
that's,
it's more sensational.

555
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,980
It's more rare than you would think.
And the cops trying to get a particular

556
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:48,591
person is more rare than you think.
Like most cops are pretty good and don't

557
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:52,050
hold grudges like that.
And when you see a cop who's arrested

558
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:55,260
somebody like four times before they get
along,

559
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,080
like there's,
there's a little bit of trash talk in a

560
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:58,831
little bit of like,
hey,

561
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:02,310
how's it going?
Like they have relationships with people

562
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:05,250
that they have to arrest a lot to get,
are not always negative.

563
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,410
Like it's,
it's fucking hilarious.

564
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:11,660
It's like the sheep dog and the coyote,
those cartoons born Sam Morton and

565
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,990
monorail.
Yeah.

566
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,110
It's just like that.
And so yeah,

567
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,370
it's just,
they're not as bad as people make them

568
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:23,400
out to be in that angle.
Like there have been some terrible

569
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,720
scandals like rampart,
but most almost,

570
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,750
you know,
like that's not,

571
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,090
that's the shit that's not really
happening.

572
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,390
Like that's the TV shit.
What really happens is they're just not

573
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:38,160
allowed to lose any interaction.
Like they can't,

574
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,180
like when they finally decided that they
don't have to chase people in

575
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:45,750
California,
if they're going like one 20 less people

576
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,140
started dying because the cops actually
had the discretion to go,

577
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,320
we don't need to win all the time,
you know,

578
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,710
but all these other things like domestic
violence arrests or shoplifting or

579
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:03,030
Tasers,
like they can't leave,

580
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,150
they can net,
you can't back off a cop.

581
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,890
You can't be like,
no man,

582
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,060
I'm not going.
Because they have to get more cops and

583
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:16,140
they have to keep getting more cops with
bigger guns until they get you.

584
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,790
They not allowed to walk away and that,
and they're not allowed to walk away

585
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:24,660
from like personal interaction that
that's the problem is that we don't let

586
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:29,310
them be themselves.
We make them be kind of these,

587
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,910
you know,
like just always challenging people.

588
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,320
Right.
They don't want to do that.

589
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,270
But that's how they're taught that they
have to kind of act around people and

590
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:42,070
they drop it whenever they can.
Like a lot of them

591
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,360
through,
you know,

592
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:46,510
some guys never drop it cause they
really get off on that shit.

593
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,460
Sorry.
Put your hands on the hood of the car.

594
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,250
So spread your legs.
Yeah Sir.

595
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,360
But a lot of them would not like to talk
to people that way.

596
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,630
Right.
They just that they're taught,

597
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,820
they have to do that.
They're in a terror,

598
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,630
terrifying and dangerous situation a lot
of times where they literally have to

599
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,120
have complete total control of that
person and compliance.

600
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:10,100
If they don't have compliance,
it leaves open the door to,

601
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,670
to weird shit.
If a guy's not assuming the position,

602
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:15,630
they can become more threatening.
I kind of get it in,

603
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,010
in,
in violent crime situations,

604
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,510
but it's just gotta be insanely
difficult to figure out when to turn

605
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:24,160
that on and when to turn that off.
Yeah.

606
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,150
Yeah.
I think,

607
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,190
yeah,
some people obviously have problems with

608
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:31,150
that to fucking difficult job
emotionally to manage and

609
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,830
psychologically to manage.

610
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,580
You're in this position where you have a
gun all the time and a good percentage

611
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:38,650
of the people you talk to all day or
full of shit,

612
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,780
they're lying to you.
They're about to commit a crime mean

613
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,690
imagine running into people and almost
everyone you see is involved in

614
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:50,440
something they shouldn't be involved in.
And you took the job because you like

615
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:52,030
people,
you know,

616
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:55,630
like you took the job because you wanted
to protect people and have people

617
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:00,870
respect you and all you get is fucking
disrespect and picking up shoplifters

618
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:06,490
and heaven turds thrown at you by some.
And then teenagers make fun of you

619
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,680
remember what it was like after nine 11,
how that big shift came about and people

620
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,920
like really appreciative of uh,
they started calling them a first

621
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:16,750
responders.
It was like the first time they had to

622
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,160
call them first responders.

623
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,820
It was like a common expression in the
news cause it used to be,

624
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,810
you know,
uh,

625
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,520
emergency people,
nine 11,

626
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,520
it would be cops or firemen.
But when they started calling him first

627
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:32,521
responders and people were like super
happy to see cops and super happy to see

628
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,150
firefighters,
especially for quite a while.

629
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:38,490
They've got a lot of respect.
Yeah,

630
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,060
yeah,
yeah.

631
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,910
But it kind of wore off.
I mean,

632
00:31:42,911 --> 00:31:46,630
firefighters I think still get there was
they get most of what they used to get.

633
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:48,700
They don't get the full blast that they
used to get,

634
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,930
but now cops,
every time one of them fucks up showing

635
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:56,110
up on video and it's reflecting poorly
on everybody.

636
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,160
But we really do have to take any
consideration to two factors when you're

637
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:05,110
looking at these videos.
One is the sheer amount of crime you're

638
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:07,510
talking about that takes place on a
daily basis.

639
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,980
So what you're saying is if you have,
I mean,

640
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:12,820
think of the many,
many,

641
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:14,350
many,
many cities in this country and the

642
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:14,891
many,
many,

643
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,521
many,
many,

644
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:17,830
many cops having interactions with the
many,

645
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:19,870
many,
many people who have committed crimes.

646
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:24,010
It's pretty rare.
You see a video of a cop doing something

647
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:27,790
really fucked up in consideration to
that when you're talking about these

648
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:31,270
millions of interactions and to have one
every couple months.

649
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,560
People like,
God dammit,

650
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,780
what one of these fucking people going
to stop doing that?

651
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:36,490
Well,
a,

652
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,160
it is good,
very good that we have a now to catch

653
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:43,010
those people and weed those people out
so they don't exist anymore.

654
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,440
That's a beautiful thing.
But B,

655
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,320
we,
we,

656
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,130
it's certainly like had an impact
knowing that they're going to be filmed

657
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,580
w knowing that it's likely to be filmed,
it's gonna eliminate some of the,

658
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,560
uh,
some of the corruption,

659
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,540
some of the evil shit that we've caught
cops doing.

660
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,840
It was definitely gonna have pressure on
them and social pressure that's going to

661
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:06,410
cause people to change their opinions
and change the way they conduct business

662
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,860
or they conduct the business of law
enforcement.

663
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,610
But at the end of the day,
the numbers are shockingly small.

664
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,950
If you really stop and think about it,
how much,

665
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,900
I mean,
I'm not trying to be like a cop

666
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:21,290
pathologist,
but I'm just saying we really should

667
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,820
take into consideration whenever we do
any of these conversations about it,

668
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,480
how many fucking cops there are,
how many crimes they're handling on a

669
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:32,700
daily basis,
and how insanely brutal that must be on

670
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,240
your psychological system,
your emotional system.

671
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,820
I've,
I've maintained a few times and I don't

672
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:40,590
think it's a job that,
I think it's a job that very few people

673
00:33:40,591 --> 00:33:42,330
are qualified for.
I think you have a,

674
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,430
you have to have a very strong mind to
be able to handle that in a very fair

675
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:47,264
way.

676
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

677
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,580
It's gotta be intensely.
Yeah.

678
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,630
Could you imagine just getting shot at
you like,

679
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,150
well,
fucking high speed chases catching

680
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:58,730
people in the middle of the crimes.
Domestic violence.

681
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,400
Yeah.

682
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,060
Well that's,
I mean it's not all excitement.

683
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,980
A lot of it is a lot of it.
It's sad.

684
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,700
It's sad for them because they'll show
up four or five times to the same house.

685
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,020
Oh yeah.
You know,

686
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,190
that's,
and they don't,

687
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,580
they don't like that.
A lot of times they'll get all the

688
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:16,100
cases,
they'll get a case nice and ready and

689
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:20,660
then the lady doesn't show up,
the cases dismissed and then four months

690
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,480
later there's another call and she's
back at the house.

691
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,480
That shit,
it's got a great on them I'm sure.

692
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,780
But like the,
I mean the police brutality videos bring

693
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:36,791
to light kind of a way that some
officers have been getting away with

694
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,840
treating people like Rodney King was,
uh,

695
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,830
was one of the first prime examples of
like cops get away with doing this to

696
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:47,300
people and yeah.

697
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,700
And it don't you think in the Rodney
King situation though,

698
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:53,630
it was pretty extreme because you're
dealing with a PCP it up,

699
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:58,100
dude that went on a high speed chase and
there was a lot more to that video then

700
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:01,070
what we saw on television.
Like I'm not excusing them for beating

701
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:02,750
the shit out of him like that.
I mean,

702
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:06,350
they should have definitely handcuffed
him and they should have figured out a

703
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:10,220
way with all those guys to restrain him.
They should have the physical manpower

704
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:12,090
to restrain that guy without beating on
him like that.

705
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:12,380
Yeah.

706
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,640
Yeah.
Um,

707
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,780
I,
my personal belief is if you lead the

708
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,560
police on a high speed chase,
they should beat your ass when you get

709
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:23,040
out of the car.
Uh,

710
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,300
that's what I've,
I mean that's what they generally do

711
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:29,660
because they're jacked up from having to
drive at that speed.

712
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,780
And I don't really say,
I'm not saying like it's morally right.

713
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,920
I'm saying like if you're currently in a
high speed chase with the police,

714
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,160
pull over slowly

715
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,330
and expect,
you know,

716
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,650
a few kisses on the lips.
This is my problem with that.

717
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,650
I don't have a problem with it in terms
of like dishing out justice,

718
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:49,980
but that's first of all kind of smacks
of vigilantism.

719
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,750
Right.
And second of all,

720
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,490
because you're not really supposed to do
that right now.

721
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:56,100
They're not supposed to,
but it's that I don't think they can

722
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,830
control.
It's not vigilantism it's a cop.

723
00:35:58,831 --> 00:35:59,551
What,
what'd you call it?

724
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,450
Just,
uh,

725
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,120
it's just inappropriate violence.
Well,

726
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:06,841
it's,
I mean,

727
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:09,540
they're trying to take physical control
immediately.

728
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,490
Have somebody who just like threatened
the lives,

729
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,980
like threatened the lines of like,
I don't know,

730
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:17,040
50 or 60 people,
like they're going to do it fast.

731
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:21,540
But here's my only concern is that it
would encourage people to get away with

732
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,270
more,
more on the line because you know,

733
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:26,280
if they get pulled over,
they're gonna get the fuck beat out of

734
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:26,700
them.

735
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,060
And it could cause loss of other
people's lives if they were involved in

736
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:32,610
a car accident by someone.
It's frantic to not get the shit beat

737
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:33,910
out of him by cops.
Yeah.

738
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,260
I just don't think you're supposed to
green light when someone can beat the

739
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:37,861
fuck out of.
No,

740
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:38,694
no,
no.

741
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,410
Shooting him,
killing him.

742
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,120
It just sounds so hypocritical and
stupid,

743
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:44,520
but that almost makes more sense.
I'm not,

744
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,180
I'm not saying like I greenlight,
I'm saying like we are dealing with

745
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:48,930
people.
Yeah.

746
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,970
It's pro.
It's going to have going to happen.

747
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,090
What's going to happen?
We need to figure out how to handle

748
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:55,950
that.
We don't want it to happen,

749
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:58,680
but it's,
that's,

750
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,380
I mean we're not using robots.
We're using paypal.

751
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,380
Exactly.
And I think that's what's most important

752
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,170
that we're talking about here.
And um,

753
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,040
when,
when we can take people and categorize

754
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:14,250
them and say,
well this guy has x amount of melanin in

755
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:17,070
his skin and his family's from this part
of the world,

756
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,380
so we'll apply rule A.
Yeah.

757
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,580
Versus if this guy is Norwegian,
white looking motherfucker like

758
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:26,340
yourself.
You apply rule be when you look at some

759
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:28,170
Sweden in you when you got there from
Norwegian,

760
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,990
look at that.
How about that?

761
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:32,490
I'm not,
I'm not even good at that.

762
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,170
Yeah,
you're really good at racism.

763
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,550
You're a very good white guy.
Well,

764
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,020
it's okay if you do it with white
people.

765
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,970
Racism.
Is that racism?

766
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,230
No,
that's not racism.

767
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,830
Who would that be?
It used to be racism.

768
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,140
It's only if it's black person.
I can't call it,

769
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:49,260
like if I call you,
if I say that you look Norwegian and I

770
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:50,880
nail it,
that is definitely not racism.

771
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,690
But if I see a black person for Haiti
and I'm like the Congo,

772
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,020
well that would be right.
Yeah,

773
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,100
you can't,
you can't get away with that.

774
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,230
Especially if it's like a really bad
place.

775
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:01,800
I pick cotton.

776
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,450
Well,
I think also it was,

777
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:05,450
the east sounded really excited when he
did it.

778
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,370
Like Congo.
Yeah,

779
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,350
well that was for the punchline.
Okay.

780
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,610
I didn't know.
Trying to be the tool to try and make

781
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:13,170
some jokes.
Um,

782
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,220
yeah man.
I think,

783
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:15,390
um,
it's,

784
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:17,370
uh,
it's just real disturbing.

785
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:20,130
It was very disturbing when you were
telling me this because it just doesn't

786
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,270
make a whole lot of sense that some
place that people would think of as such

787
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:26,430
a liberal open minded place like
Madison,

788
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:31,290
Wisconsin would be so,
so fucking backwards like that and that

789
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,940
no one's bringing this up.
Uh,

790
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,210
people have tried to bring it up.
Um,

791
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,220
they first started

792
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,770
bringing it up in 2012.
Since then,

793
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,810
it's gotten worse.
Um,

794
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,020
a couple of places have come out with
studies on it.

795
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,830
Um,
basically in Wisconsin,

796
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,110
uh,
adult black men are 12 times more likely

797
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:52,630
to be sent to prison than white guys.
Uh,

798
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,520
black kids are 16 times more likely to
be put into foster care than white kids.

799
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,430
Uh,
and of course if you're in foster care

800
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:02,650
then you're more likely to be
prescribed,

801
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,900
you know,
pills and all that fun stuff.

802
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,990
And even for that,
like in La County,

803
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,270
uh,
black foster kids are eight times more

804
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:14,050
likely to be put on behavior altering
medication,

805
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,920
then white kids also in foster care.
So it's,

806
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,040
they noticed that the numbers were
really getting bad then and then they

807
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:27,940
tried some shit to fix it and it just
gotten worse.

808
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,170
I guess
the funniest one was,

809
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:37,230
I think it was in 2014 then when there
was another study that says,

810
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,890
Ooh,
it's still getting worse.

811
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,140
Uh,
they proposed a $250,000 a gardening

812
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,620
initiative where they would teach
children to garden.

813
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:54,390
You're locking up 50% of all African
American men from 18 to 25 they're in

814
00:39:56,651 --> 00:40:01,651
jail or on probation.
And your idea is to spend a quarter of a

815
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,380
million dollars on gardening.
No,

816
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:07,630
fucking wonder.
Shit's fucked up.

817
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,030
So what was the argument about the
gardening?

818
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,170
It was going to give them a sense of
purpose because they would see these

819
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,850
flowers and fuck if I know,
but that's,

820
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,690
yeah,
like it's one of the like it's hippy

821
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:25,260
dippy bullshit is what it is.
It's fucking like,

822
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,790
I don't like,
like holy fucking yellow brick road.

823
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,750
What the fuck are you talking about?
Like are we all grown ups in this room?

824
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,590
I leave really.
We've noticed some studies that came out

825
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:41,610
of Norway where they took prisoners and
they showed them how to make tomato

826
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:44,370
sandwiches and they could grow their own
tomatoes.

827
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,310
They got so much more comfortable.
But being a person like let's,

828
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,400
let's keep stealing fathers from their
children and then also,

829
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,780
but you know how we took your dad.
This is the magic of Patagonia.

830
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,340
You know,
like you know,

831
00:41:02,341 --> 00:41:05,130
story,
we fucking shattered your family but

832
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,160
aren't lilacs beautiful and you have to
ride the bus to come see your lilacs.

833
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,330
It's just horse shit.
It's just,

834
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,930
if that's what they think will make a
difference,

835
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,470
then we're fucked.
Yeah.

836
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:24,300
I mean that's probably a good idea for
like maybe a community center that wants

837
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:27,120
to help kids out and give them some
sense of purpose,

838
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,040
but a sort of subscribe that to
criminals are the people that you've

839
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,040
convicted of crimes or people that
you've put

840
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,873
in jail.
Like

841
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,150
just anybody and you can't make people
garden.

842
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,420
It's like we actually had a war about
that.

843
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:46,870
There was a war about 150 years ago
about making people garden based on the

844
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:49,280
color of their skin.

845
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,030
It was the civil war.
I found an article about it.

846
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,871
What I'm saying?
Yeah.

847
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:59,020
The anecdotes from this are kind of fun
if you want to read it.

848
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,650
I've been locked up my whole life.
So doing programs like this are like

849
00:42:02,651 --> 00:42:05,590
planting a seed.
He said you have to nurture a plant

850
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,740
almost like a kid.
It's kind of weird to think about it

851
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:11,650
that way,
but I think it's going to show me how to

852
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:13,630
become an adult.
Wow.

853
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,730
And he said that after he brained the
social worker and raped her dead body,

854
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,710
can I,
can I do it and pr style?

855
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:24,040
Yes.
And after everyone had a chance to talk,

856
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,300
it was time for some hands on gardening.
One table was just covered with dried

857
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:31,270
lupin in Larkspur plants that the
inmates stripped of seeds.

858
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,960
After the gardening work was done,
the inmates gathered again in a circle

859
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,140
to talk about how to connect what
they've learned from life after they

860
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,870
released.
John is currently serving time for his

861
00:42:40,871 --> 00:42:43,330
six drunk driving convictions.
A little too sexy.

862
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:43,480
It's

863
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,450
pretty good.
But you're a little too sultry.

864
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:46,960
You Burn,
you burn sign.

865
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:49,060
You burn it a little slower but you do
burn.

866
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:54,100
He got to be a little more dry.
To me it's the self satisfaction.

867
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,023
No,
there's,

868
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:00,310
there's like almost like a hipstery
quality that you have to acquire over

869
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,750
your,
your sound as well.

870
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,280
Okay,
I'll work on that.

871
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,250
It's pretty good though.
What is going on with that voice that

872
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,230
they do that one thing.
We're men.

873
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,521
You that.
Okay.

874
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:14,230
Here's a perfect example.
That dude who was a in Canada who got in

875
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:17,080
trouble with all the ladies because they
said that he liked to throttle them.

876
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,360
I'm that dude.
Uh,

877
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,670
John Ghomeshi.
Do you know who he is?

878
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,370
Okay.
He was the guy that was on trial in

879
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:27,310
Canada because a,
a bunch of girls that you hooked up with

880
00:43:27,311 --> 00:43:28,330
city beat the shit out of him.

881
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,640
Blow the fucking like the Canadian like
male feminists.

882
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,483
That guy.
Oh,

883
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,820
he was always there.
He was a male feminist who talks like

884
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:40,810
this and has a very,
very subdued way of speaking.

885
00:43:40,811 --> 00:43:45,811
So tell us about your band and where,
where did you guys start out?

886
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,321
Like in this,
you know,

887
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:50,860
that weird,
not a real person sort of a thing going

888
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,480
on.
He was the king of that shit.

889
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,853
That,
what is that?

890
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,310
What?
What,

891
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,510
what does that gender neutral sort of
strange when you talk like this?

892
00:43:58,990 --> 00:43:59,710
Yeah.
No.

893
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,590
What is that?
Why are they doing that?

894
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,680
They're trying to relax.
You almost like hypnotize you into not

895
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,240
just going with it.
There's no emotion to it.

896
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,500
It's like a soft rock dj,
but,

897
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,700
but yeah,
a little creepier.

898
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:17,560
It's like a,
you know what though?

899
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,620
Honestly,
I'd have to say I prefer it when I'm

900
00:44:20,621 --> 00:44:23,260
listening to like very intelligent
things.

901
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,550
Yeah.
Like if I'm listening to like,

902
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,240
yeah,
cause you don't want to hear somebody be

903
00:44:28,241 --> 00:44:28,631
like,
yeah,

904
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:33,090
the fuck at Tampa pusha ablation has how
the modern nuclear weapon operates.

905
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,110
Yeah,
exactly.

906
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,920
Or even when someone's discussing like
when they're talking about like a very

907
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:41,280
intense subject that's a hotly into
debate.

908
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,310
I almost prefer it like this
nonjudgmental weird sort of not really a

909
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:51,240
person way of communicating the pan
determined we going to get classical

910
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:53,310
music almost.
Yeah.

911
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:56,730
Like that eight a classical music.
You can retain the knowledge better so

912
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:00,450
to speak that way.
Well I'm fascinating as as a comic I'm

913
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:03,050
fascinated by all those different.
Um,

914
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,830
there's like pre determined patterns
that people can plug into.

915
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,840
Like you can become a top 40 dj and
everybody knows how to do it.

916
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,650
Top 40 DJ style.
All right.

917
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,070
There's just a way of talking where it
just say,

918
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,380
oh well this guy is going to play me
some top 40 songs.

919
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,060
I know his voice.
He's on the ball,

920
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:21,871
you know,
he's doing it.

921
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:23,790
Perfect.
Strip club Djs and other one.

922
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,640
It's like a similar one politician
voice.

923
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,690
This is a bunch of different voices that
people are allowed to plug into.

924
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,840
Yeah.
I guess cop voice to you could,

925
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,310
you could add cop voice to that to comp
voice.

926
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

927
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,190
Hillary Clinton is so bad at public
speaking.

928
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,420
She's terrible at it,
right?

929
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:44,760
Like how do you do it that long and suck
that bad?

930
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,440
Oh my God.
Well,

931
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,461
you know what,
man,

932
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:50,490
I think she's tired for one.
I bet if he caught her when she was 40

933
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:51,970
she was probably a firecracker.
Yeah.

934
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,450
You know,
she's a lady that's dealing with a

935
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:59,250
failing older body and it's a real
problem for people because they don't

936
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:02,610
really get wise enough for us to
consider them running the nation until

937
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:03,360
they're older.

938
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,680
You know?
Like if Katy Perry wanted to be

939
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,570
president tomorrow and be like pitching,
I old enough,

940
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,380
she's not.
She's not 35 all right.

941
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,370
But for when she started,
okay,

942
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,700
Jennifer Aniston,
she's,

943
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:13,980
she's 35 she's like 42 or something like
that.

944
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,410
She's not a good judge of character.
She's hot as fuck.

945
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,790
She's really hot.
But she's had,

946
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:21,090
she never did anything to her chin.
So strong chin.

947
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:22,060
Still work.
Yes.

948
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,030
Chain is,
don't sell yourself short,

949
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,750
but like if she wanted to become
president would be like,

950
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,670
get the fuck out of here.
You're too vibrant.

951
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,800
You're too young,
you have too much going on.

952
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,900
It's a real catch 22 for a woman.
Yeah.

953
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,200
Cause like the only way you would accept
a woman in office as a woman,

954
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:41,610
like an old withered politician like
Hillary who's been in the trenches.

955
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,850
I
yeah.

956
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,710
Yeah.
I think you kind of have to be a little

957
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:48,690
close to death for people to vote for
you,

958
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:49,440
for president.

959
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,120
It's true.
You've got to look a little bit like

960
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:53,580
shit.
Well we tried it with Obama with a,

961
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,320
a really vibrant guy and he came out
looking like death came out looking 20

962
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:00,150
years old.
We were bastard.

963
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:02,250
Yeah.
I think we bothered him way more than he

964
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:03,420
thought we would bother.
Oh,

965
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:07,170
100% at mean just the job itself.
I don't think any,

966
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,510
I think it's the same thing we were
talking about.

967
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:13,560
Like it's really difficult to be a cop
magnet time that time.

968
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,940
What a million magnify that.
Probably more than a million.

969
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,590
And you've got with the president is,
yeah,

970
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:20,510
I mean the,
the,

971
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:25,510
the sheer volume of information that
that guy must have to process on a daily

972
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:28,760
basis about international affairs.
She,

973
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,640
Putin in Syria and Saudi Arabia is doing
what and what's going on in Turkey in

974
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:37,770
the fucking terror attack and France and
oh yeah.

975
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,520
Jesus Christ

976
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,750
just has to decide bullshit over and
over and over again because your body

977
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:46,300
keeps fucking shit up for him and now
he's got to deal with it.

978
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,940
That just internationally he's supposed
to take care of national stuff too.

979
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,800
So stop and think about that.
He,

980
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:56,801
it's like he's got a hundred really
fucking strong opinionated neighbors who

981
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:02,690
like to fight with each other and you've
got to somehow under the negotiate peace

982
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:03,930
settlements and,
and,

983
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:08,970
and even send some of your thugs to
watch over certain areas to protect them

984
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:12,410
from shit getting crazy.
And he's constantly supposed to be

985
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,830
communicating with all these generals
and processing all that stuff.

986
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,240
Yep.
God.

987
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,610
And then on top of it,
he's supposed to be fixing the economy

988
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,210
and then on top of it he's supposed to
be straightening out the problem with

989
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,200
people having student loans that are
vastly more than their actual education.

990
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,190
Yeah.
Fuck that job.

991
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

992
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,970
He,
he's a dumb ass for trying to get that

993
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:36,130
job.
That's too much work for too little

994
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:37,450
money.
But he's a lawyer.

995
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:38,920
Yeah.
And he wanted to win.

996
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,660
Yup.
Competitive.

997
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,010
That's probably it,
right?

998
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:43,450
Yeah.
You get on that track.

999
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,110
I get,
you know,

1000
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,190
maybe he was like,
fuck,

1001
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,940
I'm a senator from Illinois,
so I guess my choices or get the fuck

1002
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:52,270
out here and go to prison like every
other elected official from Illinois.

1003
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:54,641
Yeah.
What was the,

1004
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:55,840
was it Detroit?
Which,

1005
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,910
what city was it where,
um,

1006
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,530
what was like the big arrest recently?
Oh yeah.

1007
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,170
Somebody in Detroit,
the Mayor of Detroit,

1008
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:07,000
I believe it was.
The mayor was like,

1009
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,060
I don't want to say that.
I should be real clear.

1010
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,090
I don't know if it was really the mayor,
so don't sue me.

1011
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:17,260
Yeah.
But someone got some pilot for something

1012
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,430
almost hilarious.

1013
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,690
Yeah,
yeah,

1014
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,450
yeah.
It was like whenever a mayor gets popped

1015
00:49:23,451 --> 00:49:25,940
for something sexual,
it's fucking riot.

1016
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:29,480
Well,
the my favorite mayor stuff of all time

1017
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:32,090
was Marion Barry when he got caught
smoking crack,

1018
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:35,320
went to jail.
Got Out of jail and want again.

1019
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,260
Yeah.
Oh,

1020
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:41,290
that was beautiful one again.
Former Mayor of Detroit a couple of

1021
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,360
years ago got sentenced to prison.
What was it for?

1022
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,040
Prison corruption.
Yeah.

1023
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,253
Yeah.
That's okay.

1024
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,980
That's it.
Yeah.

1025
00:49:48,981 --> 00:49:50,750
He was the former mayor when he got
arrested.

1026
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,880
Yeah.
That's the dude x Detroit mayor.

1027
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,260
It's two 28 years in prison for
corruption.

1028
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,580
Woos name is,
is that Quami?

1029
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,700
Quami Quami Quami 28 years for
corruption falling series of scandals

1030
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:08,850
that showed that he had unchecked power
while in office.

1031
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,770
Bam.
Unchecked

1032
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,810
motherfucker like empire.
I haven't seen empire,

1033
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:18,590
but those what it looks like.
Unchecked power.

1034
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,900
Yeah.
Yeah,

1035
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:21,983
yeah.
Damn.

1036
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,590
Why else would it be mayor once,
once get his freak on.

1037
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,830
I know mayor.
This is the thing is imagine if you went

1038
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:27,980
on

1039
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,760
a path to being president 20 years ago,
which Obama most likely dead,

1040
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:32,180
right?
Yeah.

1041
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,470
So think about it.
He,

1042
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:36,290
what is he now?
He's like 50 so back then he was 30 and

1043
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:39,320
if you think about when he was 30 and
he's thinking to himself,

1044
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:40,940
you know,
I'm going to be the president in United

1045
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,810
States,
I'm on this path,

1046
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,650
and I'm seeing all the pussy that John
F.

1047
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:49,040
Kennedy got and I'm seeing all the power
that all these other presidents had.

1048
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,180
And I'm seeing,
I'm seeing it,

1049
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:53,540
seeing all the respect that they got
when they got out of office and then as

1050
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,810
obviously,
definitely didn't think that he would

1051
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:58,250
get all the pussy that jfk,
he's,

1052
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:00,220
I'm sure he's a faithful man.
It's just in the,

1053
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,650
in the vein of humor.
But it's nice to be offered.

1054
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,210
Yeah.
It's nice to know that you've got,

1055
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,390
you could possibly have the kind of
power to shut the lights out on people,

1056
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,680
make them disappear.

1057
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,290
So he does that.
He does.

1058
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,220
He could.
Right.

1059
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:18,320
And then in those 20 years,
you see the world change so drastically.

1060
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,030
Well,
you can't,

1061
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:22,580
he see Clinton get popped with Monica
Lewinsky.

1062
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Yeah.
That was step one.

1063
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:24,500
Like,
Oh shit,

1064
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:25,890
I still want to do this.
Yeah,

1065
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,440
I believe this.
And then,

1066
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:31,370
but Bush managers to go through and then
social media comes around and in the

1067
00:51:31,371 --> 00:51:35,870
midst of the social media world,
that's when Obama steps in.

1068
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,960
So the amount of scrutiny and insults
and the amount of data that's directed

1069
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:44,570
his way as opposed to every other
president before him.

1070
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,380
It's like unprecedented.
Yeah.

1071
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,960
There's never been a guy that's been
subject to so many different signals of

1072
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:54,560
negativity coming as wet.
Cause before that people were sort of

1073
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:55,940
voiceless.
They couldn't really do anything.

1074
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:01,210
But in Obama's time blogs became a way
more prominent online news sources and

1075
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:06,380
many people's world replaced the,
the regular newsprint.

1076
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,770
Yeah.
So it's not just what do they talk?

1077
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,880
What are they saying to me?
All about me in the New York Times,

1078
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:15,910
it's
thousands of different blogs and it's

1079
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:17,390
amazing,
man.

1080
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,400
Amazing change of events that have
rendered the position incredibly

1081
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:25,430
unattractive.
So then eight years later,

1082
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:28,550
this is what you get.
You get crazy old Bernie sanders with

1083
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:30,250
his fucking wacky hairdo.
Yeah.

1084
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,030
Who hates money?
Yeah.

1085
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:37,210
You get crazy old Hillary Clinton who's
shrieking and she's built like a fucking

1086
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:42,020
converse all star box.
The whole thing is she's,

1087
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,360
I mean,
she looks like her body's failing.

1088
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,370
Like it makes me uncomfortable and I see
her.

1089
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:50,150
I think she's probably fine.
I think she's probably in good health.

1090
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,740
I just think they don't know,
man.

1091
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:56,210
I just think she's not,
I know how bad she wants it,

1092
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,560
but she doesn't have charisma and,
but even if she got it,

1093
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:03,680
look,
look at the amount of fucking stress

1094
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,680
that's involved in that job.
How can that possibly be healthy for

1095
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:09,230
someone who's really older,
she'll handle it.

1096
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,150
Do you think fun?
Yeah.

1097
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,120
If she were to get the job,
she would handle that better than Obama

1098
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:17,810
probably had because she's been in the
trenches her whole life,

1099
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,793
right?
Yeah.

1100
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:24,070
She's fucking like,
you got no question that she knows how

1101
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,830
to the game.

1102
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,890
It's a game to her and that she's trying
to win.

1103
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,350
She's trying to do some nice shit for
people.

1104
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,480
You know,
she's trying to help people out,

1105
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,020
but completely cynical,
you know,

1106
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:40,140
100% I mean,
she was the secretary of state.

1107
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,630
She's had people killed,
you know,

1108
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,300
she's ordered drone strikes.
Oh a hundred percent.

1109
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,890
So we'll do you,
she's fine.

1110
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,000
You saw her reaction to Gadhafi you saw
the news piece,

1111
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,220
what these people were talking to her
and she sits down.

1112
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:53,850
She goes,
uh,

1113
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,070
we came,
we saw he died.

1114
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,390
Huh?
Yeah.

1115
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,710
Seen that right?
No,

1116
00:53:58,770 --> 00:53:59,910
no,
no.

1117
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,270
You must watch it cause there a thug
life version of it too.

1118
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,000
That's the one that put up,
pull up the fuck life version of it.

1119
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,270
But it just shows you again,
what was she,

1120
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,300
she was a lawyer.
She was a lawyer and these lawyers who

1121
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:17,700
eventually become politicians,
they like to win.

1122
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,310
I just that what my physical like people
are like,

1123
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:21,690
why,
why do you worry about her physically?

1124
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,960
Maybe I didn't explain or maybe you
haven't heard.

1125
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,100
Um,
it is alleged and I think it's,

1126
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:33,330
it's sort of been reported on that she
had blacked out and falling and hitting

1127
00:54:33,331 --> 00:54:37,860
her head recently in the last few years.
She's 70 [inaudible] it's gonna happen.

1128
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:40,890
But um,
that she had had a fairly traumatic

1129
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:43,490
brain injury from that.
That was something that,

1130
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:44,670
just pull that up,
Jamie.

1131
00:54:44,671 --> 00:54:49,020
See if he could find that story because
that might be republican bullshit.

1132
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:50,020
I might be like,
uh,

1133
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,240
well I'll lift relating republican
propaganda also.

1134
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,390
Uh,
Ronald Reagan had some brain damage and

1135
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:00,330
he was amazing.
You know,

1136
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,690
like maybe,
maybe we don't get a president with a

1137
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:05,820
hundred percent thinker.
It doesn't matter.

1138
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,200
I mean it definitely matters.
But at this point in time,

1139
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:12,690
I wonder what the Ronald Reagan thing
was.

1140
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,640
Interesting.
Cause he deteriorated as he was in

1141
00:55:14,641 --> 00:55:16,650
office.
He started off very fresh.

1142
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,600
If you go back and listen to some of his
early speeches like wrong,

1143
00:55:19,601 --> 00:55:22,560
Reagan gave me hell of a speech.
Like tear down that wall.

1144
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,420
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1145
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,110
He,
he had that one super bizarre speech.

1146
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:32,910
Do you remember this one where um,
he was standing in front of the United

1147
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:33,810
Nations,
I believe,

1148
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:39,260
and he gave a speech about how quickly
we would all put our differences aside

1149
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:42,360
if we were attacked by aliens from
another planet.

1150
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,840
He's 100% right.
He was 100%.

1151
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:49,290
He is 100% right.
But I mean it was one of the strangest

1152
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,950
fucking speeches ever.
And the like.

1153
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:58,010
It is one that the Ufo lovers have clung
to like a life raft.

1154
00:55:58,411 --> 00:56:01,800
He knew it was going to tell us.
He knew me.

1155
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:02,634
Yeah.
He's like,

1156
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,740
yeah,
I remember that Cold War that we just

1157
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:09,741
all of a sudden stopped in 1989
yeah.

1158
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,890
Work on lasers.
If you have you seen that one,

1159
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:14,740
that speech.
It's,

1160
00:56:14,741 --> 00:56:16,320
it's really interesting.
I'll look that up.

1161
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,270
Did you find the Hillary won the thug
life one?

1162
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,210
I found a thug life one,
but I'm not sure that it's about

1163
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:22,350
Gadhafi.
Oh,

1164
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,860
okay.
I came,

1165
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,290
we saw he died.
If that's the speech,

1166
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:28,020
she's like sitting,
getting interviewed.

1167
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,810
Thing I find about brain cancer is like
national and corner got brain cancer.

1168
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,321
No,
no,

1169
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:33,460
no.
She fell and hit her.

1170
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:35,470
Yeah,
I've found anything about that.

1171
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,410
A concussion she has.
She might be suffering from post

1172
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:41,110
concussion syndrome.
Is this from the inquirer?

1173
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,760
This is not from that.
From breitbart.

1174
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,010
Okay.
Might as well be earlier this year.

1175
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:47,200
I know.
I didn't find anything for much other

1176
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:49,360
and regarding that,
so there's,

1177
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:52,660
so I did repeat Republican propaganda.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1178
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:56,650
Lisa called myself out all that.
That's how they get you find out what

1179
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:58,030
that is in any way.

1180
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,870
Substantiated.
I think she did have a concussion,

1181
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:04,990
but I don't know like the or she's
suffering from it.

1182
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,800
Okay,
well load.

1183
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,640
That's when you're that old and you had
a concussion and you,

1184
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,000
you're going to have some fucking
issues.

1185
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:10,660
Yeah.
Oh,

1186
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,970
what those issues are and whether or not
they're treatable.

1187
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,530
That's,
that's uh,

1188
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:16,340
something only she would know.
Yeah.

1189
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,130
George Bush fucking puked his guts out
all over the prime minister of Japan.

1190
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:25,930
We also fell and blacked out and hit his
head because he choked on a pretzel no

1191
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,130
earlier.
George Bush.

1192
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,260
Oh yeah.
Old School.

1193
00:57:29,261 --> 00:57:30,340
Herbert Walker.
Yep.

1194
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,900
Yeah.
Remember when,

1195
00:57:31,901 --> 00:57:32,590
uh,
there was like,

1196
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:36,430
that was the big conspiracy because Bush
had like bruises and a black eye and

1197
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:38,200
shit and somebody,
somebody beat the fuck out of the

1198
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:41,200
president,
but that he said he choked w with a

1199
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:43,930
pretzel in his mouth and fell and hit
his face.

1200
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:46,100
Like,
if I was the Illuminati and I was going

1201
00:57:46,101 --> 00:57:49,180
to beat up the president at,
that's what I would make them say.

1202
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,220
Oh,
I want you to tell them that he choked

1203
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,054
on a pretzel.
Yeah.

1204
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,650
Ooh,
Ooh.

1205
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:56,020
What happened?
What happened?

1206
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:57,340
He blacked out.
Stupid.

1207
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,230
You fell and you hate your fucking head.
Okay.

1208
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,180
And then you've got this black guy.
What?

1209
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:04,010
Black Guy?
Hello?

1210
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:06,670
Oh

1211
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,810
yeah.
Do you think the Illuminati beat up

1212
00:58:08,811 --> 00:58:09,830
George Bush?
Tommy?

1213
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:13,160
Uh,
now I think probably Dick Cheney had him

1214
00:58:13,161 --> 00:58:14,130
in the face.
Changes.

1215
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:15,710
Beat the fuck out of him.
Yeah.

1216
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:16,950
He's like,
fuck them too.

1217
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,740
Yeah.
I mean,

1218
00:58:18,741 --> 00:58:22,400
but that was probably tender.
Like they got a history together.

1219
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:25,610
I just have a bit about Dick Cheney
because Dick Cheney shot his friend in

1220
00:58:25,611 --> 00:58:27,840
the face and he made his friend
apologize.

1221
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,293
Yeah,
no shit.

1222
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,580
Dick Cheney's hard fucking car.
I mean,

1223
00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:36,581
come on man.
That guy was on TV apologizing for Dick

1224
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,390
Cheney after Dick shot him in the face.
Yeah.

1225
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,690
And he was like 70,
he shot him in the face at 70 with a

1226
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:42,563
shotgun.
Yeah.

1227
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,620
I put,
I put Hillary Clinton in Dick Cheney

1228
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:48,410
kind of in the same boat as like the,
and you know,

1229
00:58:48,411 --> 00:58:50,030
like the Henry Kiss and you're like,
oh yeah,

1230
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,480
they'll just now just do whatever.
You know,

1231
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,070
like if they decide someone needs to go,
they'll just,

1232
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:58,610
you know,
that's just that dictate who's a scary

1233
00:58:58,611 --> 00:59:02,510
guy and his,
he's also still involved.

1234
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,950
Like he still,
he absolutely believes in voicing his

1235
00:59:06,951 --> 00:59:10,010
opinion and what shouldn't,
shouldn't be done internationally.

1236
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:11,480
Like even now today.
And He's,

1237
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,190
he scares me.
Yeah.

1238
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,200
Well he has to be,
uh,

1239
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:20,030
like he has to stay kind of involved
because you know that he committed war

1240
00:59:20,031 --> 00:59:21,740
crimes.
Everybody that

1241
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,540
you know,
um,

1242
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,630
I mean shit,
he fucking engineered war profiteering

1243
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,670
against our own,
you know,

1244
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:30,550
like,
so you think they'll start cheese,

1245
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:35,180
he stays active so that he avoids
prosecution by constantly staying in the

1246
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:36,020
mix.
Yeah,

1247
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,920
and George Bush did the opposite,
so they both ran in separate directions.

1248
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,740
Dick Cheney shows up and says,
wow,

1249
00:59:42,741 --> 00:59:45,110
we had to torture him cause we needed
intelligence.

1250
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,350
Good.
That's good impression.

1251
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:49,790
All right.
Try and then George Bush stays the fuck

1252
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:53,360
out of it because if you notice,
those guys don't travel internationally

1253
00:59:53,361 --> 00:59:54,410
so much.
Yeah,

1254
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:57,500
that's probably a bad move.
They don't travel internationally

1255
00:59:57,501 --> 01:00:01,730
because the jurisdiction for human
rights violations is worldwide.

1256
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,340
It makes them technically hosty humanoid
Generis,

1257
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:08,750
meaning enemies of mankind at large.
So just like Spain did with Pinochet,

1258
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,980
any court can try them.
They just need to be able to say that

1259
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:17,750
the courts in their home jurisdiction or
where it happened are not able to do it

1260
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,130
and then they can do it.

1261
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,040
So whoa,
they stay here.

1262
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:24,650
They go to,
so do they have treaties with any

1263
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:26,630
countries?
Like is there any country that they know

1264
01:00:26,631 --> 01:00:29,320
for sure won't prosecute them if they
travel internationally?

1265
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,160
It,
yeah,

1266
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,590
there's country.
There's jurisdictions where they know

1267
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:35,680
won't prosecute them,
but they can go to the UK.

1268
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:39,170
Well,
but the thing is the ability to

1269
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:44,171
prosecute someone for war crimes under
the Hague.

1270
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,850
And you know,
because these trend,

1271
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,120
these human rights violation rules,
trump,

1272
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,510
all the treaties,
they trump fucking everything except for

1273
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:58,511
a couple small technical points.
So a county prosecutor in Nebraska could

1274
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:03,110
file the charges against Dick Cheney.
Whoa.

1275
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:07,880
And although that might violate United
States law and they might say you have

1276
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:12,200
to do it here or here or here,
no technique.

1277
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:17,030
I mean basically like so any
enterprising prosecutor in Spain,

1278
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,130
if they could lay their hands on them,
they can do them.

1279
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,100
Any body,
any process you.

1280
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:26,150
So depending on the way that the country
organizes its prosecution system,

1281
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,890
the lowest level person competent to
make the decision could potentially try

1282
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:34,100
to jack a mom.
You know?

1283
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,220
So like I know I'm saying like his level
of travel has to be so well coordinated

1284
01:01:39,471 --> 01:01:42,620
because fucking county sheriff could
take him in for this shit.

1285
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,770
Wow.
The wrong county sheriff could pick him

1286
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:47,750
up on this.
Has anybody ever tried to do that?

1287
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,190
No.
No.

1288
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,110
And that's,
you know

1289
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,350
why they don't travel?
Because they fact that nobody's ever

1290
01:01:57,351 --> 01:02:00,770
even tried to do that.
And the evidence is overwhelming and

1291
01:02:00,771 --> 01:02:03,110
clear that Dick Cheney,
you know,

1292
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:06,290
for instance,
remember the Guy who authored the report

1293
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,420
saying that torture was okay?
Yeah.

1294
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,170
That itself is a violation of
international law for which you can be

1295
01:02:12,171 --> 01:02:13,004
prosecuted.

1296
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,063
Yeah.

1297
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,390
So,
and that's just,

1298
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,640
that's the tip of the iceberg.
So that guy can't,

1299
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:23,220
because when if he,
I mean they can travel a little bit,

1300
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:26,220
but there's countries they can't go to
because they'll snap him up and

1301
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:29,340
prosecute him because yeah.
These just,

1302
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:34,260
I forget exactly what I'm talking like
it's hard to explain.

1303
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:39,610
Anyone can prosecute him for any of this
shit.

1304
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:43,420
Everybody has the proof and when he goes
to other countries,

1305
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:47,890
they will use the fact that we have not
prosecuted him here as proof that we're

1306
01:02:47,891 --> 01:02:50,710
not going to,
which will allow them to go forward.

1307
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,190
So all it would take would be like say
if he decides to make a trip to,

1308
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:57,241
you know,
whatever.

1309
01:02:57,241 --> 01:03:00,390
Some European country yeah.
All would take is one ambitious person.

1310
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,160
Yup.
That's what happened to Pinochet

1311
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,230
and that was a,
I think a decade long fight.

1312
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,630
That's why a so fascinating.
Yeah.

1313
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,250
That's why Paul Pot never left Cambodia.
It's,

1314
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:16,590
it's so also so fascinating that we have
these weird rules that the presidents

1315
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:17,310
have.
Yeah.

1316
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,050
Like we're a presence.
Can get away with certain things,

1317
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:21,390
like they can admonish people or they
could,

1318
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:22,051
uh,
rather,

1319
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:22,884
um,
uh,

1320
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,280
release people from jail.
Yeah.

1321
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,780
They can suspend their senses

1322
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,540
for federal offenses and governors can
do it for state offenses.

1323
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:35,800
It's just one of those,
you got to have a release valve on some

1324
01:03:35,801 --> 01:03:39,130
shit and they use it like Bill Clinton
did it for a lot of political feminist

1325
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,530
pardons.
The get as many as you want.

1326
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,480
Wides.
Yeah.

1327
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,050
Ben,
you can get someone out like for a

1328
01:03:46,051 --> 01:03:47,940
violent crime.
Um,

1329
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,150
there is a,
depending on the jurisdiction,

1330
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,440
for instance,
in Wisconsin,

1331
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,680
there is no functional limit on the
power of the governor to let you out.

1332
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:01,120
Yeah.
Or pardon you,

1333
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:05,440
cause there's no limit.
He's the governor and other governors

1334
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:10,441
before of him if instituted a sort of
boards that we'll review requests for

1335
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:13,420
clemencies and pardons and shit like
that.

1336
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,390
And they have ad hoc rules where they're
like,

1337
01:04:16,391 --> 01:04:18,310
well,
it's gotta be at least five years ago.

1338
01:04:18,311 --> 01:04:19,660
You've got to show us this and this and
this.

1339
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:23,170
But in reality,
he could do whatever the fuck he wants.

1340
01:04:23,171 --> 01:04:25,060
That's insane.
Because he's the executive.

1341
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:28,540
Uh,
county sheriffs also have the ability to

1342
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:29,800
release people from jail.

1343
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:31,160
Okay.

1344
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:36,160
Because they run the jail.
A sentence only says that you should be

1345
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:41,351
confined for this for x amount of time
and the governors in charge of the

1346
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,780
Department of corrections so he can let
you out early if he feels like it.

1347
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:50,360
And County sheriff is in charge of the
jail and if county sheriff needs the

1348
01:04:50,361 --> 01:04:51,440
room,
he can kick out.

1349
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:53,570
That's what he did with Paris Hilton.
He said,

1350
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,780
I need the bed for somebody else get up
and they can do that.

1351
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:00,470
There are some minor checks on it and
prosecutors get really mad.

1352
01:05:00,471 --> 01:05:02,240
But no,
they,

1353
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:07,040
they have almost unlimited,
almost free reign in the area of

1354
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:09,060
pardons.
That's like some King Shit.

1355
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,240
It is King Shit.
It is.

1356
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:15,530
That is what kings can do.
It is the power of life and death.

1357
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:18,220
The strange thing to give someone
that's,

1358
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,680
it's,
it's so weird that that still exists.

1359
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:25,740
It has to exist because you cannot trust
the courts to do fairness.

1360
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:27,640
Really?
Yeah.

1361
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,300
But you can trust the governor.
Courts are good for technical points.

1362
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,250
Right.
But every now and again there's a guy

1363
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,200
and he's in and the courts won't listen.
So the governor has got to be able to

1364
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:39,390
let them out.
Like,

1365
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:42,460
Oh man,
it seems like it opens a door for a lot

1366
01:05:42,461 --> 01:05:44,590
of fuckery.
It no,

1367
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:48,790
because everybody's looking like you
can't pardon someone without anybody,

1368
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,320
without everybody knowing.
Right.

1369
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:53,470
But on a offense case,
you know when you're sitting on the

1370
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:54,510
fence on it,
well they're,

1371
01:05:54,511 --> 01:05:55,950
yeah.
They're not going to influence someone

1372
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,920
one way or another.
No.

1373
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,030
I mean,
Nixon got,

1374
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:02,440
pardon teddy really?
Who pardoned Nixon,

1375
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,770
I don't know.
But Clinton pardoned his own brother,

1376
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:06,604
I'm pretty sure.

1377
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1378
01:06:08,771 --> 01:06:10,360
You can just do that.
Yeah.

1379
01:06:10,361 --> 01:06:14,660
This drug offending brother and his
final executive actions,

1380
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:18,330
and Susan Mcdougal,
his Whitewater business partner and a

1381
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,540
low and a member of the Symbionese
Liberation Army.

1382
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,570
Jesus Christ.
I also want to add that I was just

1383
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:28,120
looking up that George Bush Cheney
thing.

1384
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:32,140
Supposedly it's false that they don't
actually have outstanding warrants right

1385
01:06:32,141 --> 01:06:32,621
now.
No,

1386
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:35,890
they don't have warrants or any,
they're not wanting necessarily know.

1387
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,230
They're not wanted anyone can file the
charges.

1388
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,590
So there's no,
yeah,

1389
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,790
there's no,
no,

1390
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:45,900
no one has to file charges,
but basically tens of thousands of

1391
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:49,150
different prosecutors across the globe
could,

1392
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:52,960
they can do it,
but they're not going to do it unless

1393
01:06:52,961 --> 01:06:55,930
they can get their hands on him.
This look at all the other,

1394
01:06:55,931 --> 01:07:00,550
the other list or rather the other
people on the list to Clinton pardoned.

1395
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,370
He pardon that.
Michael Milkin junk bond king.

1396
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:06,250
Oh.
Milkens got an office in Santa Monica.

1397
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,370
Now that guy was,
that guy was terrible person.

1398
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,860
He fuck people over bad,
right?

1399
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,960
I mean,
did a lot of people get fucked over by

1400
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:15,010
that guy?
Uh,

1401
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,710
tons of people got fucked over by that
guy.

1402
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:20,670
Um,
the Whitewater business partner too.

1403
01:07:20,671 --> 01:07:22,360
That's a,
that's crazy.

1404
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:26,650
But now Michael Milkin has a nice little
foundation where he teaches kids,

1405
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:27,760
uh,
music.

1406
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,200
Look at this.
She,

1407
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,900
uh,
Clinton friend from Arkansas spent 18

1408
01:07:31,901 --> 01:07:36,130
months in prison after refusing to give
evidence that might implicate the

1409
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:40,150
president and first lady in a bank fraud
while he was the state's governor.

1410
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:42,400
That's okay.
How much do you think she,

1411
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,390
he,
she got paid

1412
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,240
after he pardoned her?
How much she,

1413
01:07:47,241 --> 01:07:48,840
a paid shout.

1414
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:50,263
Yay.

1415
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:52,600
Yeah.
I mean they roll deep.

1416
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,760
I'm sure she's doing fine.
Yeah.

1417
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:56,110
How does that work though?
How do you,

1418
01:07:56,111 --> 01:07:57,910
uh,
how do you pay someone off like that and

1419
01:07:57,911 --> 01:07:59,320
foundation?
Oh yeah.

1420
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:01,930
You give them a junction.
What a great idea.

1421
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:04,660
Clinton Foundation,
the Clinton Foundation,

1422
01:08:04,661 --> 01:08:07,190
like one of those charities are like
you,

1423
01:08:07,191 --> 01:08:11,620
you go and look at exactly how much goes
to the actual actual cause.

1424
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:15,830
Is it one of those things that pays
themselves and can take trips and

1425
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:16,220
whatnot?

1426
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,660
Really?
Isn't that adorable?

1427
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,680
Did you see she got her FBI meeting this
weekend,

1428
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,960
who did the three and a half hour
meeting with the FBI?

1429
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:25,940
Hillary did.
I was seeing some other reports that

1430
01:08:25,941 --> 01:08:29,300
Bill Clinton had like a special in air
meeting with the,

1431
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:32,740
one of the people that we're going to
talk to her before it and lay it.

1432
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,700
Yeah.
Someone from Arizona or something like

1433
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:35,800
that.
Is that where it was kind,

1434
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:40,120
Kinda like he said he made a impromptu
trip to visitor who in prompt,

1435
01:08:40,121 --> 01:08:41,310
who's on jet?
Anybody?

1436
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:45,740
Anybody out there?
Anybody impromptu and I mean like how

1437
01:08:45,741 --> 01:08:46,980
ball is he?
Yeah.

1438
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,440
Well,
it was just doing the air.

1439
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,890
I decided to go by and say hello and all
for a piece of Pie.

1440
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:54,590
Yeah.
I was just coming over to be neighborly

1441
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:58,190
and my fucking private jet.
He's super concerned about the

1442
01:08:58,191 --> 01:09:01,230
environment,
but yet flying around on private jets.

1443
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,400
Well no,
that was his little brother Al Gore.

1444
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,050
This whole thing is so rigged,
man.

1445
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,640
It's,
it's such a strange,

1446
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:12,390
strange world we're living in.
We're,

1447
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:16,220
we're going to have,
what is this 20 years of supposedly

1448
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:19,220
democracy and there's only two different
last names,

1449
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,470
three different last names,
so thanks.

1450
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:23,570
Obama.
Obama snuck in there.

1451
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,090
They almost turned it around again with
this.

1452
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,210
They wanted it to be Bush Clinton,
but Bush is not very good at it.

1453
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,980
The sound chip guys just not very good
at it.

1454
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:34,040
I feel like you threw in the towel like
he gave.

1455
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,260
Like I feel like you're just like,
fuck you guys.

1456
01:09:36,261 --> 01:09:39,230
I don't want this job.
And he stumbled his way through some

1457
01:09:39,231 --> 01:09:40,064
shit.
Yeah.

1458
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:41,960
Well I,
I bet you it was.

1459
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:46,990
I bet ya he was a little hurt that he
didn't get picked for 2000 and then

1460
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,840
there was a day where he was like,
whew,

1461
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,540
thank God I'm not that guy.

1462
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,850
You know,
I'm waiting for someone to get up there

1463
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:58,130
and just go,
this job can't be done.

1464
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,380
Don't elect me cause this job can't be
done.

1465
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:03,260
No one can do this job.
I'm voting for you because if you vote

1466
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,260
or I'm asking you to vote for me,
for me,

1467
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,830
I'm going to get rid of this job.
Yeah.

1468
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,250
The first thing I'm gonna do is
president is get rid of the president.

1469
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:10,991
Yeah,
we may,

1470
01:10:10,991 --> 01:10:13,830
maybe we maybe need to,
presidents is a lot of things.

1471
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:20,640
You need a council of elders,
so I can't preside over this shit.

1472
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,190
Pardon Jimmy Hoffa.
But he was dead and then Jimmy or Nixon

1473
01:10:25,191 --> 01:10:28,370
was pardoned by Ford and that's what led
to him not getting reelected.

1474
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,510
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1475
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:31,580
Yeah.
So yeah,

1476
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:35,000
that's what led to Ford not being
reelected.

1477
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,210
Yay.
Have contributed to his defeat.

1478
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:39,080
I'm,
it's not the only thing.

1479
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,040
Oh,
so not a crook.

1480
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:43,610
Also,
I think Ford's obsession with combating

1481
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:44,720
inflation.
Did a man.

1482
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,860
Did you ever see the uh,
thing that hunters Thompson did with

1483
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:53,861
Bill Murray and it was um,
they were mock trying to bring Dick back

1484
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,450
and see how many people would go for it.
They were just trying to show how easy

1485
01:10:59,451 --> 01:11:03,080
it is to manipulate people and how dumb
they are politically and he was trying

1486
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:07,880
to bring back,
see if he could find that man.

1487
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,610
It was like bring Nixon back,
you know,

1488
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:13,590
bring Nixon back.
Then he had like Nixon masks stuff and

1489
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:14,070
they were trying

1490
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,940
to,
he got a bad deal.

1491
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:16,010
He got a bum deal.
Yeah.

1492
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,780
And they were talking to people on the
street and trying to convince them.

1493
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,150
But it was bill Murray and hunter s
Thompson.

1494
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:25,800
It was from
something Gonzo and Hollywood or

1495
01:11:25,801 --> 01:11:27,990
something like that.
It was like a documentary that they did.

1496
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:29,850
This should probably be a clip of it
somewhere.

1497
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:34,820
My family hated Richard Nixon growing up
because when Richard Nixon came to

1498
01:11:34,821 --> 01:11:38,930
Wisconsin rapids,
my grandfather arranged for a cadillac

1499
01:11:38,931 --> 01:11:43,931
for him as he got off the plane and to
address the people he stood on the

1500
01:11:44,061 --> 01:11:46,850
Cadillac,
scratch the hood with his shoes and

1501
01:11:46,851 --> 01:11:48,800
refuse to pay for it.
Whoa.

1502
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:52,370
That was so not anything about the
spying.

1503
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:55,580
That was not my family's problem with
Richard Nixon.

1504
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,830
It was that he scratched the hood of a
Cadillac.

1505
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:00,190
Well that was a piece of shit move.
Yeah.

1506
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,510
And that shows man's character.
Like here's a,

1507
01:12:02,511 --> 01:12:05,450
here's an example.
My friend Brian Cowen.

1508
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,590
Do you know Brian cal?
Yeah.

1509
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:07,640
Met Him.
Hilarious.

1510
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:09,200
Standup comedian.
Awesome human being.

1511
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:10,363
He,
um,

1512
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:15,760
his mom told him once that she caught a
guy cheating at golf and she told her

1513
01:12:18,321 --> 01:12:19,670
husband,
don't ever trust that guy.

1514
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:22,520
Don't do business with them.
Cause he cheats at golf.

1515
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:24,110
He'll cheat it.
Everything else too.

1516
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,420
Yeah.
Just a casual game of golf amongst

1517
01:12:26,421 --> 01:12:27,440
friends and she caught him cheating.

1518
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:28,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

1519
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:29,541
Like man,
you know,

1520
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,340
and when that bad,
yeah.

1521
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,300
The golf that transfers over.
Yeah.

1522
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:35,740
Yeah.
It really does.

1523
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,750
Yeah.
So in that sense,

1524
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:43,840
what are you looking up again?
Still haven't found it.

1525
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,070
I got a picture of Bill Murray with
Thompson and the Nixon thing,

1526
01:12:48,071 --> 01:12:50,280
but nothing,
oh,

1527
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:51,070
I

1528
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:54,160
wish I could remember the um,
the actual name of the documentary,

1529
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,890
but it was a BBC documentary.
They did.

1530
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,140
They did on him.
It was really interesting stuff.

1531
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:01,390
And part of it,
he talked to one of the guys who

1532
01:13:01,391 --> 01:13:06,391
testified against Nixon and uh,
this guy was like in deep,

1533
01:13:07,181 --> 01:13:11,150
deep trouble before the tapes came out.
And then the tapes came out and,

1534
01:13:11,151 --> 01:13:14,050
and exonerated him and prove that what
he was saying was true.

1535
01:13:14,051 --> 01:13:16,030
But yeah,
a hundred was talking to him and

1536
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,160
interviewing this guy and just shows
you,

1537
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:21,130
um,
the times then like we're so much more

1538
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:25,210
sinister and what the government was
capable of doing like in many ways had

1539
01:13:25,211 --> 01:13:26,450
been sort of Defang.
Yeah.

1540
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:29,030
Hm.
Well,

1541
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,120
I mean,
yeah,

1542
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,650
they,
they can't break,

1543
01:13:31,651 --> 01:13:33,750
they can't get away with as much easy
shit.

1544
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,700
Right.
Like maybe they don't have fangs,

1545
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:37,190
but now they have tentacles.
Right.

1546
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:40,320
So it's like a Japanese sit monster
situation,

1547
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:42,970
like drones,
things along the long,

1548
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:47,520
they have drones and I mean,
you know they have facebook.

1549
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:51,960
Yeah.
So they can create 11,000 fake profiles

1550
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:56,220
on facebook and send out friend requests
and now they know where everybody is.

1551
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,370
Who's got their shit marked public.
You know,

1552
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:03,270
they know when you're in the valley,
they know when you're at Burger King of

1553
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:04,530
they're really looking out for you
though.

1554
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,360
I'll do really fallen,
you know?

1555
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,820
No,
I mean most of this data is bullshit

1556
01:14:08,821 --> 01:14:10,470
that they can never use.
But,

1557
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:12,250
but they're accumulating it cause

1558
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,090
they're,
I mean,

1559
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:16,450
they're like Marma sets.
Like if you ever see Marma sets at the

1560
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:18,700
zoo,
put something colorful up against the

1561
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:22,150
glass and you got their attention and
our personal details,

1562
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:26,080
although completely fucking worthless
and useless and boring.

1563
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,140
It's interesting to somebody.
And so they want that shit.

1564
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:32,500
They want to know who we're calling.
They're obsessed with that stuff because

1565
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:36,160
they're curious because there are people
and so they collect it thinking we might

1566
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:39,280
get a use for this or we might figure
out that somebody is a terrorist and

1567
01:14:39,281 --> 01:14:42,520
then we'll get everybody the day call
and then they hang on to all this other

1568
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:44,110
stuff.
Cause that might be useful to,

1569
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:46,690
they're just hoarders.
Like they're creepy hoarders.

1570
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,900
Right.
And it's under the guise that one day

1571
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:51,460
you might commit a crime.
Yeah.

1572
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:54,250
One day we might need this so we're
gonna keep this.

1573
01:14:54,251 --> 01:14:55,600
That's what a hoarder things.

1574
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,720
Well it's not really just hoarding cause
it's,

1575
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:00,670
you're,
you're hoarding other people's stuff.

1576
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,830
Right.
I mean it really is other people's

1577
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:05,470
personal data,
which we haven't really,

1578
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:10,480
we haven't really made the concession
that if I use email or if I make phone

1579
01:15:10,481 --> 01:15:13,270
calls or if I sent texts,
the government has all this,

1580
01:15:13,271 --> 01:15:14,410
we haven't made that concession.
Yeah.

1581
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:14,831
Right.
No,

1582
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:16,810
but it seems to be a reality.
It is reality.

1583
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:19,900
Yeah.
But no one has agreed to that yet.

1584
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,160
And they're just like,
ah,

1585
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:23,350
freedom.
Need it for freedom at well.

1586
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,440
And every time something like that goes
to court in an actual court as opposed

1587
01:15:28,511 --> 01:15:32,260
to their Pfizer courts where we're not
even allowed to know what they're asking

1588
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:34,360
for.
When they go in regular court,

1589
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:36,850
they lose,
but then they just go and do it in a

1590
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:38,950
secret court that lets them do whatever
the fuck they want.

1591
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,890
We'll also,
do you know how many times terrorist

1592
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:46,891
attacks have been stopped by a tapping
into people's phones and reviewing

1593
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,300
people's emails?
I'm going to guess is zero.

1594
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:52,570
I would say zero.
Yeah.

1595
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:53,830
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna go with zero.

1596
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:57,730
I mean maybe one or two.
But you know what they like to do?

1597
01:15:57,731 --> 01:16:00,610
That's adorable.
They like to create terror scenarios.

1598
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,000
Can we pay attention to those when they
talk a guy in the blowing something up,

1599
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:06,700
give him a bomb on a rest and when he
tries to detonate the bomb because the

1600
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:08,080
bomb wasn't real in the first place.
Yeah.

1601
01:16:08,081 --> 01:16:12,640
They used to do that to black panthers
and everybody in the sixties and

1602
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,990
seventies well they used to love that.
Yeah.

1603
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:17,290
And that was another thing that we
learned about the Nixon administration

1604
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:21,690
with the terms of the civil rights
movement and in terms of the antiwar

1605
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,301
movement.
Yeah.

1606
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:23,830
This is it.
This is the,

1607
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,180
this is the actual video itself.

1608
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:30,900
Two friends to help stage
man got a raw deal.

1609
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:34,650
So it's Bill Murray and his brother
who's also an actor.

1610
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:35,970
Forgot his brother's name.
Chad.

1611
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:40,780
We're going to ask him on omnibus.
Brian.

1612
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:47,090
Brian doing my
ass.

1613
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:54,280
Nixon.
Pardon us now more than ever,

1614
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,370
the meeting in Beverly Hills isn't a
runaway success.

1615
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:02,740
Total attendance of three.
That's the voice.

1616
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,650
I
didn't forgive him.

1617
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:10,190
And why

1618
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,710
did it change your mind?
Yeah,

1619
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:13,450
your speech,
the excitement.

1620
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,670
I'm wearing that shirt.
Everything surrounding my mind is being

1621
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:21,230
changed tonight.
Serious dude.

1622
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,970
Seriously.

1623
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,610
The scientologists,
they were watching that they're going

1624
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,090
fuck wheel.
We could've got that guy.

1625
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:27,760
We kind of got that guy now Nixon's got
him shit.

1626
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,860
So that was what,
1978 yeah.

1627
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:37,880
That's hilarious.
So it's many years after Watergate.

1628
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,520
Hilarious.
Yeah.

1629
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,910
Well they can't do that anymore.
But this whole email thing,

1630
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:45,680
the Clinton email thing,
that's,

1631
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:47,270
that's,
that's bizarre.

1632
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:50,180
That's a bizarre one.
You know what their problem is?

1633
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:55,490
What they did Whitewater and like the
Clintons beat him at Whitewater.

1634
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:58,130
Right?
Even though he fucking pardoned people

1635
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:00,350
that worked for him,
who did time,

1636
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:04,580
they beat Whitewater.
The Whitewater was,

1637
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,220
a lot of people think it's Watergate.
Okay.

1638
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:11,690
When you're a little,
when you're in government,

1639
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:16,900
you're privy to some things about where
roads might go or where electricity

1640
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:23,360
might be routed.
You just get information and if you do

1641
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:26,330
that stuff,
you could make real estate investments.

1642
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:30,650
You can't profit from stuff like that.
That would be wrong.

1643
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,140
But what if your wife was a consultant?

1644
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,880
Oh,

1645
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:40,570
that's not exactly how Whitewater went
down,

1646
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:45,630
but that is how most of the corrupt
politicians that you see operate,

1647
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:51,870
their wives have bullshit jobs and the
bribes are funneled in through that in

1648
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:56,890
substantial part.
And so it could be a green lighting

1649
01:18:56,891 --> 01:18:58,540
something or it could be,
but yeah,

1650
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:01,320
it's just,
it was just a real estate scandal and it

1651
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:05,140
was probably just real estate
investments that went bad and their

1652
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:08,140
books probably we're not in order.
So then they had to keep their mouth

1653
01:19:08,141 --> 01:19:09,910
shut.
They probably weren't really fucking

1654
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:10,990
around that much.
What?

1655
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:15,040
What's really fascinating know there's
one that's more obvious and more blatant

1656
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,980
that no one bats an eye on.
And that's the Dick Cheney Halliburton

1657
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:18,850
connection.
Well,

1658
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,610
yeah.
I mean it's not family and it's not

1659
01:19:21,611 --> 01:19:23,530
marriage,
but when you look at the fact that this

1660
01:19:23,531 --> 01:19:26,590
guy was a ceo of Halliburton,
then how Britain gets these no bid

1661
01:19:26,591 --> 01:19:31,591
contracts for billions of dollars and
elected officials are supposed to suck,

1662
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:38,400
kind of sequester their assets and
trusts a blind trusts so that they don't

1663
01:19:39,251 --> 01:19:43,390
really know if they're benefiting their
ownership interest in Halliburton or

1664
01:19:43,391 --> 01:19:45,570
Kellogg Brown.
No,

1665
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:47,290
it's bullshit.
It's bullshit.

1666
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:49,450
You're supposed to just pretend like you
don't own it,

1667
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:54,780
and if you put it on paper in a blind
trust meant to benefit you and your

1668
01:19:55,061 --> 01:19:57,400
assigns,
you technically no longer own it.

1669
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:58,180
Well,
let's just,

1670
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,870
let's just be like the most optimistic
possible.

1671
01:20:01,871 --> 01:20:05,380
Let's say Dick Cheney didn't profit from
how Burton having all these no bid

1672
01:20:05,381 --> 01:20:07,950
contracts and he's still,
but he's hooked up a buddy.

1673
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:08,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

1674
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,440
I mean,
either way it's these,

1675
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:11,820
he used to work there,
man.

1676
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:16,850
He used to be the CEO and then he,
and he hooked him up with selling $48

1677
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:19,650
cases of soda.
48 bucks.

1678
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,110
Well,
it would cost a lot of money to get soda

1679
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:24,330
to Iraq in his defense.
Yeah,

1680
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:26,530
it doesn't,
it does not get it.

1681
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,890
Put It on a plane,
going to hire someone to carry it.

1682
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,380
I know.
And for that they could have built a

1683
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:33,990
fucking Coca Cola plant.
Yeah.

1684
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:35,730
But you don't want to cultural
appropriation,

1685
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:36,770
you know,
go over there.

1686
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,550
Cultural appropriation,
super bad.

1687
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:41,510
Now that's over there with Coca Cola.
That's colonialism.

1688
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,190
I think that is,
it's technically called.

1689
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:47,250
It's just,
it's amazing that they pulled that off

1690
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,130
and that's not under investigation,
but Whitewater,

1691
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,720
which is,
you know,

1692
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,580
fucked up real estate venture.
Yeah.

1693
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:56,870
Like 4 million bucks worth of real
estate versus owl.

1694
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,880
Know $1 trillion that may be incentive
to go to war.

1695
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:06,060
Maybe incentive,
do certain actions that caused massive

1696
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,110
loss of life.
Well they,

1697
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,110
I mean they thought they were going to
win and make a nice chunk of change.

1698
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:13,350
That's crazy.
Shit spun out of control and they ended

1699
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:16,740
up making a lot of money and that's
real.

1700
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:20,310
Like what is the movie going to be like
that we're going to vet evidently,

1701
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:25,380
evidently eventually watch like there's
going to be a movie in maybe 10 or 15

1702
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:30,381
years where it shows the,
the madness that was the original Iraq

1703
01:21:31,411 --> 01:21:35,340
war and the call to all these people
that there was weapons of mass

1704
01:21:35,341 --> 01:21:39,500
destruction and people a testifying to
him and then realizing it was bullshit.

1705
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:43,170
Like Oh,
all the chaos involved and all the the

1706
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,530
behind the scenes shit.
Like someone's going to do a bad ass

1707
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:46,830
movie.

1708
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:50,520
Like I'll put tune Oliver Stone style
movie about that war.

1709
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,613
It's common,
right?

1710
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:53,700
Yeah,
probably.

1711
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:58,320
I mean they've done the hurt locker.
They done zero dark 30.

1712
01:21:58,321 --> 01:22:01,660
They did a Tina fey one in Afghanistan.
Um,

1713
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,320
Tina fey.
Yeah,

1714
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,580
the comedy.
Yeah.

1715
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,520
She's a comedy and Afghanistan called
WTF.

1716
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:10,380
I think this is real.
Yeah.

1717
01:22:10,381 --> 01:22:11,640
Whisky Tango,
Foxtrot.

1718
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,070
Is it been out yet?
Just came out a couple of months ago.

1719
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,160
There's too many movies.
That's the problem is there.

1720
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:20,910
There are literally too many movies to
watch because they don't stop making

1721
01:22:20,911 --> 01:22:23,400
movies and you can never watch all the
movies that have already been made.

1722
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:25,650
So it's like being in debt but still
buying shit.

1723
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:27,660
There's no way you're going to catch up
on the great movies.

1724
01:22:27,661 --> 01:22:29,910
Yeah.
I can't watch all the superhero movies

1725
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,230
that come out.
There's too many of them.

1726
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:33,780
I'm done.
I think I'm done.

1727
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,670
They just too,
they're too obvious.

1728
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:37,530
Yeah.
I want more watchmen.

1729
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,120
You know,
that was,

1730
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:43,380
that was a real fucking superhero movie.
Like that was a great movie that I want

1731
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:46,050
more of those come on people.
Yeah.

1732
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,610
You know?
Yeah.

1733
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,310
I haven't,
that's like the last time I saw a

1734
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:54,420
superhero movie that felt like it grew
up with me.

1735
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,570
Do you know what I'm saying?
Did you read it before?

1736
01:22:57,571 --> 01:22:59,760
Did you know anything about it but
nothing new.

1737
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:02,250
Nothing helps that.
Yeah.

1738
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:04,790
Because maybe it would be disappointed
if I had read the stuff.

1739
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,260
They think they're fucking up your,

1740
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:10,930
that is a problem.
That's a problem if you're a hardcore

1741
01:23:10,931 --> 01:23:12,910
fan.
I remember in squad looks interesting

1742
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:14,680
cause I've never seen,
I didn't read that shit.

1743
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:16,900
But it's cool to see a bunch of villains
get together and,

1744
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,970
hmm.
I've never seen him do.

1745
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:20,051
Yeah,
that'd be cool.

1746
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:21,700
It looks,
it looks really fascinating.

1747
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,400
It looks like what's going to be really
dark and creepy and should maybe be fun.

1748
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:27,620
It's totally possible.
That could be something like that

1749
01:23:27,621 --> 01:23:28,250
watching it.
Yeah,

1750
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:31,210
but I think watchman's my favorite
superhero movie I think.

1751
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:34,180
Hmm.
What's yours?

1752
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:37,660
I was just trying to remember like I
remember when I saw the avengers the

1753
01:23:37,661 --> 01:23:38,494
first one,
right?

1754
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:40,930
A couple of years ago when I first came
out and they'd fucked up New York and

1755
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:43,700
everyone looked like that was awesome.
But it also could have been,

1756
01:23:43,701 --> 01:23:47,380
it was the first time we saw the
conglomeration of all the superheroes

1757
01:23:47,381 --> 01:23:48,040
together.

1758
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,740
I could go back and watch it now.
I'm probably have different thoughts on

1759
01:23:50,741 --> 01:23:51,101
it.
Right.

1760
01:23:51,101 --> 01:23:52,660
Because if,
and if you do another one,

1761
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:53,950
what we already know,
they get together,

1762
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:57,100
like the whole charm of them getting
together for the first time it's been

1763
01:23:57,101 --> 01:24:00,640
worn off and how you're going to get the
hook to listen to you get the fuck out

1764
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:01,503
here,
bitch.

1765
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,550
I didn't buy any of that.
I'm like,

1766
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:06,190
he's not going to listen.
That's why he left.

1767
01:24:06,191 --> 01:24:07,260
He's sad.
He's gone.

1768
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:11,380
You can't find them now that he was the
best Hawk though that dude.

1769
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,310
What's that?
Yeah,

1770
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,020
that's the best talk movie I think.
Yeah,

1771
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:16,270
yeah,
for sure.

1772
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:17,163
Yeah.
Yeah.

1773
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,060
He was full on bill bixby.
Yeah.

1774
01:24:19,061 --> 01:24:21,550
Mark Ravello is a bad ass act.
Like he,

1775
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:25,570
I believe that he was smart enough to
create the kind of,

1776
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:27,700
you know,
conditions that would lead to him being

1777
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:28,170
the hulk

1778
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:29,940
and he's,
and he plays it like,

1779
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:33,930
so yeah.
Like it was like a guy,

1780
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:37,320
like when Eric Bond and Norton did it,
it,

1781
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:39,740
they kind of missed the point of like,
now you're,

1782
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,550
you know,
you're a guy who turns into the Hawk

1783
01:24:41,551 --> 01:24:44,490
like a lot.
You're fucking sick of it.

1784
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,440
Like it's not cool anymore.
Right.

1785
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:49,080
You're just like,
God fucking dammit.

1786
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:50,820
I'm the fucking hall could like,
it's,

1787
01:24:50,821 --> 01:24:52,470
you know,
it was like being an alcoholic,

1788
01:24:52,471 --> 01:24:55,020
like blacking out and waking up in
Tijuana.

1789
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,840
That's the hulks life.
And then he asked to move on.

1790
01:24:57,841 --> 01:25:02,130
Like it's frustrating and like he played
that frustration really well.

1791
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:05,730
You know what the number one problem
with all of the hulk movies and all the

1792
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:09,060
whole comic books are?
Number one problem is pants.

1793
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:09,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1794
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:12,180
What the fuck is going on?
Yeah.

1795
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:15,270
Those pants would not survive.
He's so much bigger.

1796
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:16,830
Yeah.
Then Mark Rufallo.

1797
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:19,320
Yeah.
And those pants stretched to fit his

1798
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:23,220
gigantic ass.
Just huge thighs.

1799
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:26,730
Yeah.
But the shirts off a related story to

1800
01:25:26,731 --> 01:25:28,890
today.
I just typed in the hawk on Google.

1801
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:33,150
There's a guy,
he's going to fight isis.

1802
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:36,500
He looks like the hug.
Oh,

1803
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:38,900
this guy's going to fight isis.
He looks like a gorilla.

1804
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,380
He's like,
that's the hairiest guy.

1805
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,560
Is he a Persian Hawk man?
That guy was huge.

1806
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,800
He wants to fight isis.
Does he know they have guns?

1807
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,270
Giant 24 stone bodybuilder.
I don't know how much that is.

1808
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:53,400
I think a stone is 13 pounds.
Is that right?

1809
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,140
Google?

1810
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,420
Yeah.
24 how the fuck did you get that big at

1811
01:25:57,421 --> 01:25:59,460
24 hello?
Long.

1812
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:04,430
I've been doing steroids.
The giant man with a fierce as a cult

1813
01:26:04,431 --> 01:26:07,160
following on instagram where he posts
what he does best.

1814
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:11,300
Weightlifting.
This is just a guy that wants attention

1815
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,820
and they're giving him attention.
This is so silly.

1816
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:17,620
He's got a stick his head back and
flexes traps and that's how he's going

1817
01:26:17,621 --> 01:26:19,460
to fight isis.
I don't think that's going to work.

1818
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:22,010
I mean,
he could probably throw tennis balls

1819
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:25,460
hard enough to kill someone.
Probably throw like five pound weights.

1820
01:26:25,461 --> 01:26:26,990
I don't think he'd kill anybody with a
tennis ball,

1821
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:30,900
you know?
I mean maybe like choke them.

1822
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:33,350
I mean if you get it right in their
mouth,

1823
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:36,270
even if you get it right in their mouth,
you'd have to hold it in there.

1824
01:26:36,271 --> 01:26:37,490
I take them breathe through their nose.

1825
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,350
Yeah.
And then you have to like cover their

1826
01:26:39,351 --> 01:26:41,990
nose and that would be what kills him.
I have,

1827
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,950
I have to rework my plan to kill a bunch
of people because they,

1828
01:26:44,951 --> 01:26:47,110
it involve tennis balls and I realize
it's not gonna work.

1829
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,590
It's not going to work.
I'm going to work,

1830
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:50,390
but you can get fucked up by the tennis
ball.

1831
01:26:50,391 --> 01:26:54,140
You'd probably get some nice cte from a
head shot to the temple,

1832
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:55,340
but like one of those,
uh,

1833
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:58,010
tennis machines,
it serves American gladiator.

1834
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:03,200
Blop.
Blop like if you see how fast one of

1835
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:03,760
those,
like,

1836
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,070
uh,
who's like the best male Federer is that

1837
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:11,680
the guy is the guy's name that did,
I think they're getting 108 hundred,

1838
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:15,790
880 miles an hour with a tennis ball.
Yeah.

1839
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,240
Imagine catching that on the nose.
Yup.

1840
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:19,910
Yeah.
You're going to get some cte.

1841
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:21,950
You get some sparks will fly.

1842
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:25,010
You got to lose some memories.
You're going to get a black guy like

1843
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:27,440
George Bush hundred and 63 is the
fastest.

1844
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:28,910
Ooh,
that's fast.

1845
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:30,050
Yeah.
God Damn.

1846
01:27:30,051 --> 01:27:33,500
That's fast.
And his ball hitting in the template 163

1847
01:27:33,501 --> 01:27:35,540
miles an hour.
And what is a golf ball then?

1848
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:37,460
Golf ball is probably even faster.
Right?

1849
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:39,310
Does that make sense?
Yeah,

1850
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:40,250
for sure.
Cause it's,

1851
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:42,080
it's cuts the hair better too,
right.

1852
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,870
Can hit off of a solid piece of metal
instead of just some strings.

1853
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:45,501
Right,
right,

1854
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:48,290
right.
And it's also getting hit today with

1855
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:50,960
late fees.
Crazy flexi polls that have,

1856
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,360
you know,
they,

1857
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,760
they have a certain amount of carbon
fiber in them and they know exactly how

1858
01:27:55,761 --> 01:27:57,840
to 211 yeah.
Whoa,

1859
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:58,720
wait,
she even,

1860
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,080
yeah,
because the arm is loving.

1861
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:04,310
Like my friend Ryan got hit in the head,
Ryan Parsons shout out to Ryan Parsons,

1862
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:07,340
he got hit in the head with a,
a a golf ball,

1863
01:28:07,341 --> 01:28:08,270
a line drive.

1864
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:10,310
Fucking teed him in the head and he said
he was,

1865
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:13,820
he was fucked up for like six months on
official to 37

1866
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:19,550
Jesus Christ.
What's his name?

1867
01:28:19,551 --> 01:28:20,890
Ryan winther.
Yup.

1868
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:25,130
Jesus Christ.
That guy had some ass in that shot to

1869
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:26,780
show that again,
we'll call the ass that guy.

1870
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:28,640
I've gotten that shot and maybe that's
the secret.

1871
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:31,070
Like everybody else works out the
shoulders and he's just like,

1872
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:32,410
Nah man,
it's all in.

1873
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:35,090
Well he's a big dude too,
like with his thighs.

1874
01:28:35,091 --> 01:28:36,170
And all that shit,
but watch this,

1875
01:28:36,171 --> 01:28:41,171
watch this way,
put that ass in there so it spin.

1876
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:44,240
Tiger's back is all fucked up.
You can't even play it now because

1877
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:46,160
there's all the torque he's put on his
back over the years.

1878
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:48,550
Really through all his powers come from.
Ah,

1879
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:52,910
they said that his stance and his stroke
were unconventional.

1880
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:55,490
So in the unconventional stance and
stroke,

1881
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,670
I don't know if this is true or not,
but did that put any pressure whatsoever

1882
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:01,000
on his spine in some weird way to that?

1883
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:03,780
Yet the amount of twist he was killing
the ball.

1884
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:04,770
I mean,
he also may have,

1885
01:29:04,771 --> 01:29:07,320
may or may not have been canceling
anything.

1886
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:09,840
I don't know him.
I don't know as doctors,

1887
01:29:09,841 --> 01:29:12,810
but
are they testing him?

1888
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:16,620
I would have to be now really the test
people for golf,

1889
01:29:16,621 --> 01:29:18,600
for golf,
there's so much money.

1890
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:21,420
When we put up those,
the top 10 earners the other day for,

1891
01:29:21,421 --> 01:29:24,600
I think we're doing the fight companion.
I had switched the,

1892
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:26,850
uh,
the amount of money they make from their

1893
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:30,450
sport to the amount of money they make
from endorsements that three of the top

1894
01:29:30,451 --> 01:29:32,720
four are golfers they make,
oh,

1895
01:29:32,721 --> 01:29:37,470
all of them make over $50 million a year
in endorsements are expensive products

1896
01:29:37,471 --> 01:29:38,340
or endorsing.
Yeah,

1897
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:39,300
well,
it's not just that,

1898
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:44,040
it's the people that are endorsing them.
Usually a run by golfers like,

1899
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:48,360
like big time business investors.
Dave fucking love making meetings on

1900
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:49,194
golf courses.

1901
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,480
Yeah.
It's a point of focus and it's also a

1902
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:53,760
point of a recreation because they
gamble,

1903
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,340
you know,
and they'll make deals with each other

1904
01:29:56,341 --> 01:29:58,860
on golf courses.
So they have like tiger woods

1905
01:29:58,861 --> 01:30:01,650
representing them or Roger Federer or
der Der der Der,

1906
01:30:01,651 --> 01:30:03,630
whatever his name is.
One of those dudes.

1907
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:05,730
When those bad ass golfers do it,
they,

1908
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:06,400
you know,
they,

1909
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,670
they,
they feel like they're cool.

1910
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:10,830
Like it makes the company cooler
probably good for business.

1911
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:12,510
They'll do a couple ads and then
they'll,

1912
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:14,270
uh,
don't make them come out a couple of

1913
01:30:14,271 --> 01:30:15,660
times.
She like golf aren't their friends?

1914
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:17,340
What's that?
Two of them are not three words,

1915
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:19,890
but a Roger Federer is making 60.
He's a tennis player.

1916
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:22,620
The Lord.
And then Lebron is 54.

1917
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:26,070
Tiger still up there though.
And he is barely played in the last

1918
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:27,920
couple of years.
He made 45 million in endorsements last.

1919
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:30,030
That's incredible.
And you know what's really incredible

1920
01:30:30,031 --> 01:30:33,090
about it too,
is that like he went crashing to the

1921
01:30:33,091 --> 01:30:36,120
ground and then still by the weight of
his name,

1922
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:38,910
more than his accomplishments posts,
scandal,

1923
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:44,510
he's bounced back up to 45 million a
year and look at what he made from,

1924
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,710
from actual playing.

1925
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,530
Yeah.
It made less like 300,000,

1926
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:50,364
it says.
Yeah.

1927
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,470
That's incredible.
Look at Mickelson.

1928
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,820
Yeah.
That's incredible.

1929
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:56,910
I mean that,
that really is incredible that he's made

1930
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:58,830
that much money.
Wow.

1931
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,520
What a,
it's amazing how much money those

1932
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:04,010
fucking coffers make.
Yeah.

1933
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,580
It's amazing.
I mean,

1934
01:31:05,581 --> 01:31:06,414
he,
yeah,

1935
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:10,200
even though he made almost nothing
dollars playing golf last year,

1936
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,810
and then 45 million dot.
Phil Mickelson,

1937
01:31:12,811 --> 01:31:17,811
look at that guy number three with 52
point $9 million and 50 million of it in

1938
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:19,770
endorsements.
That is insane.

1939
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:22,680
So He's a super successful golfer.
2 million.

1940
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:26,160
2.9 million in winnings.
Winning tournaments either.

1941
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:27,061
Oh,
really?

1942
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:29,730
Might've won a couple if not at all last
year.

1943
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:30,330
Oh,
okay.

1944
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:31,051
Second,
third,

1945
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:31,950
fourth,
fifth place.

1946
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:35,450
So is he just a super famous guy showing
up too?

1947
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:36,690
Yeah,
he's been good.

1948
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:39,210
He's been a great golfer for a long
time.

1949
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:42,360
Wow.
And how would this Northern Ireland Guy,

1950
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:45,510
rory mcilroy Mcelroy Mcelroy,
the new young guns,

1951
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,570
Mcelroy homeboy.

1952
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,060
Nobody.
I mean I've never heard of him.

1953
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,850
If you heard of Mcelroy?
No I have no.

1954
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:53,430
Okay.
Homeboy made $35 million.

1955
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,350
So,
and endorsements.

1956
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,030
Golf is nuts.
What another game?

1957
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,610
It's interesting how many rich people
have attached themselves to that.

1958
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,570
What's the dumbest sport that somebody
made a lot of money and curling

1959
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,240
endorsement.
How much you think they make curly?

1960
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:06,940
Yeah,
look for the top curler.

1961
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:08,410
Crows getting mad when you bring this
up.

1962
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:10,750
By the way,
there's a bunch of people in Canada got

1963
01:32:10,751 --> 01:32:13,000
really pissed at me for talking shit
about curling.

1964
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:17,140
Think I actually got pissed.
Not unironically auto racing.

1965
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,050
It's pretty bad ass though.
Yeah.

1966
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:24,070
Well earnhardt you'd think earnhardt
would be cleaning up way more than

1967
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,610
everybody else.
Formula One.

1968
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:29,440
Oh,
auto racing is amazing.

1969
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:32,740
I mean that,
that to me is one of the craziest things

1970
01:32:32,741 --> 01:32:36,280
to dedicate your life to those formula
one guys.

1971
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:38,040
My God,
it's really,

1972
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:39,970
it,
it's interesting how that doesn't really

1973
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,410
fly over here,
but,

1974
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:45,310
but yet we do like fast cars.
Like why don't we like Nascar but we

1975
01:32:45,311 --> 01:32:46,960
don't like Formula One.
Um,

1976
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:52,090
I think NASCAR,
well I didn't ask our start from a

1977
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:53,910
bootlegging races.
Yeah.

1978
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:57,100
So that's pretty fucking real.
It's pretty cool.

1979
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:58,540
Pretty dope actually.
Yeah.

1980
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:02,050
So it's like a formula one doesn't have
that kind of fucking backstory.

1981
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,950
It's like these to have to have a trunk,
whereas Formula One is just like really

1982
01:33:05,951 --> 01:33:09,940
a race car and Nascar vehicles,
they had to be able to store whiskey and

1983
01:33:09,941 --> 01:33:11,470
um,
while they're avoiding the fas.

1984
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:13,510
Yeah.
Well,

1985
01:33:13,511 --> 01:33:16,050
yeah.
Like I think the beauty of that is kind

1986
01:33:16,051 --> 01:33:20,380
of like for Nascar,
it sorta has to be a car that you could

1987
01:33:20,381 --> 01:33:21,640
get,
you know,

1988
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:24,640
like it's gotta be based on a car that
the rest of us could get.

1989
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:26,020
Yeah.
You know,

1990
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:28,990
like when somebody just fucking crushing
it in a chevy.

1991
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:29,843
Yeah.
Yeah.

1992
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:34,720
Whereas opposed to when somebody's like,
it's a goddamn 14 foot needle.

1993
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:35,610
Right.
Like the,

1994
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,320
he's on it.
Yeah.

1995
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:41,230
And then there's a,
the guy sitting in the cockpit which is

1996
01:33:41,231 --> 01:33:43,620
in the center and he's exposed.
Yeah.

1997
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:45,130
You know,
those,

1998
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:48,490
uh,
Ayrton Senna videos of him when he was

1999
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:52,480
at the top of the heap in a,
in racing and watching from his

2000
01:33:52,481 --> 01:33:54,790
perspective,
like if you ever seen some of those

2001
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:55,870
videos,
no,

2002
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,020
dude,
it's like when you see the video from a

2003
01:33:59,021 --> 01:34:02,020
perspective of a person actually driving
the car,

2004
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:03,440
it's phenomenal.
I mean,

2005
01:34:03,441 --> 01:34:06,100
it's,
it's amazing what a us,

2006
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,920
a fast,
insane experience.

2007
01:34:08,921 --> 01:34:13,921
It is to be in a formula one car and
make those turns like that to me is one

2008
01:34:14,411 --> 01:34:17,710
of the most exciting things to watch.
And all of sports because they are just,

2009
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,990
especially if you could look at it from
their point of view,

2010
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:22,120
I mean you,
you're grabbing the cushions of the

2011
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:22,871
couch going,
fuck,

2012
01:34:22,871 --> 01:34:23,231
fuck,
fuck,

2013
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:23,800
fuck,
fuck.

2014
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,260
Yeah.
Cause they're making these split second

2015
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:28,930
decisions.
They have to take these tight turns or

2016
01:34:28,931 --> 01:34:31,630
avoiding people around them.
They're trying to cut corners.

2017
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:34,750
Like look at this guy,
look at this fucking car.

2018
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:36,063
Listen to this.

2019
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,550
Now we're watching this video.
Uh,

2020
01:34:40,630 --> 01:34:41,800
Jamie,
what's the name of this video?

2021
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:45,430
It says a first time ever.
I level camera.

2022
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:48,610
Formula One.
This is probably what I've seen online.

2023
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:53,780
Like
this looks like so much God damn fun.

2024
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:58,190
Oh yeah.
This guy's fucking in this thing

2025
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:00,710
and he doesn't have a windshield.
He,

2026
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:05,210
this little tiny windshield that's about
six inches long or six inches high

2027
01:35:05,211 --> 01:35:09,050
rather.
And he's got just goggles on and a face

2028
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:14,051
mask and the whole deal and a helmet.
But he's essentially exposed in this

2029
01:35:14,811 --> 01:35:19,160
super rocket ship.
It's got a controlled explosion going on

2030
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:23,120
flying around this track with amazing
sounds.

2031
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,563
Yeah.
It just

2032
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:31,040
says they'd do up to five g's and Nascar
get up,

2033
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:32,580
gets up to only to,
oh,

2034
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:34,730
I could imagine.
Oh yeah,

2035
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:38,570
five Jesus is insane.
You probably have to have an insanely

2036
01:35:38,571 --> 01:35:40,190
strong neck.
Yeah,

2037
01:35:40,191 --> 01:35:44,240
well I think your head's stuck in place
by some gadget now.

2038
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,420
I mean it definitely is in a nascar
because a lot of people got really

2039
01:35:47,421 --> 01:35:48,650
fucked up.
Oh really?

2040
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,880
Little correction there.
See that?

2041
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:53,750
It's a quick move with the hand,
but who the ass and kicked out a little

2042
01:35:53,751 --> 01:35:55,040
bit on them dude.

2043
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,500
Then fucking knobs on that car and
saying like,

2044
01:35:58,510 --> 01:35:59,740
donate what those buttons do it.
Yeah.

2045
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:00,191
What?
No,

2046
01:36:00,191 --> 01:36:02,990
it is the green number two knob do well
those,

2047
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:06,170
well those uh,
all those lights that go across,

2048
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:09,500
those are indicating the rpms cause they
have those in some cars.

2049
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,500
So when you see his light go and it goes
from green,

2050
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:14,430
like before,
you can see it in better,

2051
01:36:14,431 --> 01:36:15,264
uh,
images.

2052
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:21,370
But he has like see there those lights.
That's like to let him know most likely

2053
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:24,980
what is our rpms are at and when it's,
when he's in danger of blowing his

2054
01:36:24,981 --> 01:36:28,070
engine.
I don't know if these guys have

2055
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,910
regulators on their engine.
Gay.

2056
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:33,290
This is probably stupid question.
Car people are going crazy cause like,

2057
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:35,820
um,
if you buy a new car today,

2058
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:39,840
they have rev limiters.
So you'll get to a certain rpm is where

2059
01:36:39,841 --> 01:36:42,720
you could fucking torture engine and
it'll back you off.

2060
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:45,350
God Damn,
that looks fun though.

2061
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:49,830
I get excited just watching that
adrenaline.

2062
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,650
Yeah.
The thrill of the chase and what else?

2063
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:53,543
What else?
Mike Schmidt.

2064
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:54,870
Victory.
Victory.

2065
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:55,993
Yeah.
Yeah.

2066
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:58,050
So you did this for 10 years,
man.

2067
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:00,120
And then a decided,
fuck this,

2068
01:37:00,121 --> 01:37:02,070
I'm going to be a comic.
Ah Yeah.

2069
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,610
Well I was doing that on the side,
but at one point I was like,

2070
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:06,473
hm,
it's,

2071
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:09,300
they're never going to listen to this.
So I guess I'm just going to go to tell

2072
01:37:09,301 --> 01:37:10,590
jokes.
Wow.

2073
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:14,700
So you tried to enact some sort of
reform or you tried to at least say what

2074
01:37:14,701 --> 01:37:15,390
the fuck's going on?

2075
01:37:15,390 --> 01:37:16,980
Yeah.
But you know,

2076
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:20,160
they don't listen.
So do you bring any of this up in your

2077
01:37:20,161 --> 01:37:21,450
act?
No.

2078
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:25,440
Now because it's really depressing.
Yeah.

2079
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:27,203
Yeah.
Right.

2080
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:28,950
Like it's,
you know,

2081
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:31,560
to figure out a way to make that funny.
Yeah.

2082
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:33,470
Yeah.
Cause they like it's,

2083
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:38,970
it's happening right now.
Like right now somebody since we started

2084
01:37:38,971 --> 01:37:43,320
talking is getting something onto a
computer record cause we used to not

2085
01:37:43,321 --> 01:37:46,590
have computer records and so now
somebody is getting a computer record

2086
01:37:46,591 --> 01:37:51,420
that they shoplifted so there goes all
their entry level employment fucking

2087
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:52,380
for,
I don't know,

2088
01:37:52,381 --> 01:37:53,280
three,
four years.

2089
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:56,100
Good luck with have fun

2090
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:59,930
filing for disability that that just
happened to somebody else and it's going

2091
01:37:59,931 --> 01:38:01,980
to happen again in a couple more
minutes.

2092
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,760
Like it just,
it's,

2093
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,390
it's not the sensational cases that get
you,

2094
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:11,010
it's the grinding.
It's the every single guy gets a little

2095
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:14,460
more than some,
you know it's just a gradual creep.

2096
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:18,780
Like mothers against drunk driving keeps
bringing the law like the legal limit

2097
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:23,781
for alcohol down and down and down.
But they don't change the study that

2098
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:28,530
they have the cops point to to say why
the field sobriety tests work.

2099
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:33,890
So like in the 70s the horizontal gaze
Nystagmus test would say that a

2100
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:39,030
horizontal gaze Nystagmus sets in prior
to 45 degrees.

2101
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:44,060
Only if you're above a point to or,
but then they redid the study and now

2102
01:38:44,401 --> 01:38:47,160
his 0.15 and then they read it.
Explain what that means.

2103
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:50,370
So if,
if you've ever seen somebody get pulled

2104
01:38:50,371 --> 01:38:54,180
over by an officer and then the officer
has a bright light and they're on the

2105
01:38:54,181 --> 01:38:57,690
side of the road as a bunch of cars go
past like fucking strobe lights.

2106
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:03,300
So they'll have you look at a pen and
then they'll trace it like this.

2107
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:07,290
And so prior to 45 degrees,
you're,

2108
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:10,290
I should track very smoothly.
If I move it quickly,

2109
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,990
if I move it slowly,
there might be a little bit of Stutter,

2110
01:39:12,991 --> 01:39:17,991
but I'm supposed to do the test quickly.
And then if I put it there and hold it,

2111
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:20,640
I look for a little bit of aggravated
Nystagmus.

2112
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:25,940
And so the national highway traffic and
safety authority or National Highway

2113
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:26,910
Traffic Safety Board,
uh,

2114
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:28,590
put together this,
this one,

2115
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:31,650
and then the one leg stand and the walk
and turn test.

2116
01:39:31,651 --> 01:39:34,260
And they say that you can tell if
somebody's drunk,

2117
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:37,980
if they fail these tests,
the tests aren't accurate at all.

2118
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:41,610
And they were originally picked in the
70s when the limit was higher.

2119
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,950
And they would say,
these tests will only detect somebody

2120
01:39:43,951 --> 01:39:47,880
above 0.2 and then they,
when they changed the legal limit,

2121
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:52,910
they didn't change the test.
So remember in the 70s your eyes weren't

2122
01:39:53,791 --> 01:39:58,791
going to quiver over here unless you're
above 0.2 but now in the 80s they're

2123
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:04,941
telling cops that the eyes will quiver
above 0.1 and now here in the two

2124
01:40:05,101 --> 01:40:09,270
thousands they're telling them cops that
the eyes will quiver at that point above

2125
01:40:09,271 --> 01:40:10,104
0.08

2126
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:14,370
so they've changed the data to
correspond with the new laws.

2127
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:17,460
They didn't change the data.
Even they just said,

2128
01:40:17,461 --> 01:40:21,150
did it still works?
Even though the point of that test was

2129
01:40:21,151 --> 01:40:25,590
to pick people up above two point above,
a much higher limit above.

2130
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,930
They're looking for people at 0.15

2131
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:29,500
so not,
not the data,

2132
01:40:29,501 --> 01:40:30,200
but the,
the,

2133
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,620
the number that they use to determine
whether or not you're,

2134
01:40:32,621 --> 01:40:33,820
you're,
you're drunk or sober.

2135
01:40:33,821 --> 01:40:35,210
How did they know the method?
Right?

2136
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,360
Know what I'm saying is it's not a real
test.

2137
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:38,650
Right.
But they lowered the limit,

2138
01:40:38,651 --> 01:40:39,461
right?
Like the lemon,

2139
01:40:39,461 --> 01:40:41,770
it used to be 2.0 yup.
And now what is it now?

2140
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,500
One Point six 0.0 8.08 sorry.
Yeah.

2141
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:47,560
Um,
what did they use to determine?

2142
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:48,573
I mean if,
if,

2143
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:51,310
if that was what was originally
established that you had to do,

2144
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:54,220
the field sobriety would indicate

2145
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,890
that some was about how when once the
limit got lowered,

2146
01:40:56,891 --> 01:40:58,660
how do they,
how do they keep that same test?

2147
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:00,670
Like what are they used to?
They just didn't care.

2148
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,210
But they,
what do they say in that?

2149
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:05,110
The booklet?
Like you can tell it so they just say it

2150
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:08,440
just change the number.
You could see it at 0.08 with no data to

2151
01:41:08,441 --> 01:41:12,610
back it up and alive.
My Dad's got the fucking manual from the

2152
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:15,370
70s he's got the manual from the 80s got
the manual from the 90s and got the

2153
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:17,930
manual from today.
Yeah,

2154
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:20,520
it seems so they don't even care.
But um,

2155
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:22,480
but you assume though,
right?

2156
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:24,820
Wouldn't you that if someone fails that
test,

2157
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,600
that test would indicate their 2.0 will.
They'll definitely 0.8 then.

2158
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:30,820
So really you don't have to change it
well,

2159
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:34,210
but scientifically they probably should.
Well they established like when,

2160
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:38,110
but they're using it for proof that
somebody has a 0.08 right.

2161
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:42,970
When it's only effective to prove that
their 0.15 or above for example.

2162
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,290
Yeah.
So that's,

2163
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:48,610
this test is designed for people at 0.15
to fail and they're saying people at

2164
01:41:48,611 --> 01:41:51,010
Point Oh eight or failing it.
The thing is though,

2165
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:53,050
so they just don't wait.
I mean when you,

2166
01:41:53,051 --> 01:41:56,740
when they test them with a breathalyzer,
so they just barely make it illegal,

2167
01:41:56,741 --> 01:41:58,570
but they still fail the field sobriety
tests.

2168
01:41:58,571 --> 01:41:59,440
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.

2169
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,300
Yeah.
So it's subjective.

2170
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:04,360
Yeah.
The tests are subjective and we pretend

2171
01:42:04,361 --> 01:42:06,400
that Wa,
you know like one leg stand,

2172
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,300
it's seven potential.
Qs is somehow an effective way of

2173
01:42:10,301 --> 01:42:12,040
looking at somebody and tell them if
they're drunk,

2174
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:14,890
it's fucking eyeball.
Now look at them would,

2175
01:42:14,891 --> 01:42:17,860
if somebody tells passes a test,
like what have you pulled them over?

2176
01:42:17,861 --> 01:42:19,870
They pass a test,
but then they don't want to take any

2177
01:42:19,871 --> 01:42:20,704
further test.

2178
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:21,131
It's like,
look,

2179
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:22,150
I just,
I passed your test,

2180
01:42:22,151 --> 01:42:24,370
I did all your shit.
I don't want to take any breathalyzer.

2181
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,520
In most of the states of the union,
you're required to give a sample of your

2182
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:28,750
blood,
breath or urine.

2183
01:42:28,751 --> 01:42:31,690
And if you don't,
then they'll charge you with refusal.

2184
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:36,190
That's a fourth amendment,
fifth amendment violation if ever there

2185
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:37,870
was one.
But because the police,

2186
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:42,070
when most of their arguments,
it's mostly okay,

2187
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:45,970
they had to go isolation.
Well because you can't be forced to give

2188
01:42:45,971 --> 01:42:50,890
evidence against yourself and they want
you to give evidence from you that

2189
01:42:50,891 --> 01:42:54,250
they'll use to convict you.
And they want to do that at the scene of

2190
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:57,530
the crime with no legal representation.
It's not like you have your lawyer there

2191
01:42:57,531 --> 01:42:58,720
and you say,
Hey,

2192
01:42:58,721 --> 01:43:00,110
Mr,
they're saying here,

2193
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:03,670
they're saying we could only prove that
you drove drunk if you give us your

2194
01:43:03,671 --> 01:43:05,800
fucking blood,
so now give us your blood.

2195
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:08,800
Uh,
so they used to be duped,

2196
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:11,290
forcing blood draws and doing that stuff
without warrants.

2197
01:43:11,291 --> 01:43:13,330
And a couple of years ago,
the supreme court was like,

2198
01:43:13,331 --> 01:43:15,580
you guys need to get warrants for this
stuff.

2199
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:18,040
And,
but the thing is now they get warrants.

2200
01:43:18,041 --> 01:43:20,980
But isn't it problematic that it takes a
long time to get a warrant?

2201
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,300
I mean,
how long does it take to get a warrant?

2202
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:24,040
Like say if a guy gets pulled over,
you say,

2203
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:24,874
oh,
this dude's drunk.

2204
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:26,050
Hey Man,
give me some blood.

2205
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,100
No,
I'm not gonna give you any blood.

2206
01:43:27,101 --> 01:43:28,060
All right,
we got to call the cops.

2207
01:43:28,061 --> 01:43:29,200
10 minutes.
10 minutes.

2208
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,310
You,
they can be faster.

2209
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:31,173
Really?
Yeah.

2210
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:34,680
Tell us that it was those warrants or
files.

2211
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:35,620
Yeah.
No,

2212
01:43:35,621 --> 01:43:38,560
like some jurisdictions warrants do take
time,

2213
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:41,530
but other places you can be issued a
warrant over the telephone.

2214
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:44,040
But what if he gets to make a phone call
and it calls Governor Clinton?

2215
01:43:44,090 --> 01:43:45,460
Governor Clinton says,
Oh yeah,

2216
01:43:45,461 --> 01:43:48,480
you don't have to let him call you,
loosen your domain.

2217
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:52,080
I know a guy who knows God well

2218
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:56,450
let just let them dry.
We can take the test in a little while.

2219
01:43:56,710 --> 01:43:59,260
He's not prepared when we need to go
over this paperwork first.

2220
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:02,900
But yeah,
so those tests are bullshit and they use

2221
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:06,110
them because it's really,
it's just the officer needs to be able

2222
01:44:06,111 --> 01:44:08,360
to sit up there and say that you did
some shit wrong.

2223
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:10,010
Okay.
So let me say this a,

2224
01:44:10,011 --> 01:44:13,280
so if you are,
you are a criminal defense attorney.

2225
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:15,290
You get a guy who's on a drunk driving
case,

2226
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,230
um,
the cops busted them,

2227
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:21,470
but they busted him by forcing him to
give blood.

2228
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:22,610
How do you defend that?

2229
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:29,250
First you look at the stop.
So you find out how long they were

2230
01:44:29,251 --> 01:44:34,251
following him and if how much a good
driving and how much bad driving they

2231
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:37,050
viewed.
So for that you would,

2232
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:39,450
I mean,
if you want to do a good job,

2233
01:44:39,451 --> 01:44:42,630
let's say you're defending a very,
very rich person who has the money to

2234
01:44:42,631 --> 01:44:45,600
pay for this Bill Gates.
You're defending Bill Gates.

2235
01:44:45,601 --> 01:44:50,460
So you're going to order the squad video
and then you're going to open records

2236
01:44:50,461 --> 01:44:52,530
requests,
the radio communications and the

2237
01:44:52,531 --> 01:44:55,830
teletypes from the squad car to everyone
else because they might be saying

2238
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:57,930
something racist.
Or they might be saying something.

2239
01:44:58,410 --> 01:45:02,190
So you pull the teletypes and then
you're going to want the conduct records

2240
01:45:02,191 --> 01:45:05,400
of all the officers and then you're
going to want to find out if you can

2241
01:45:05,401 --> 01:45:09,480
pursue any administrative appeals of a
temporary suspension of the license.

2242
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:12,060
So you're going to do that because two
reasons.

2243
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:13,800
One,
you don't want your client's license

2244
01:45:13,801 --> 01:45:14,910
suspended,
and two,

2245
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:18,150
you might also find some things because
you might be able to get a couple of

2246
01:45:18,151 --> 01:45:22,140
records and forced the cops to show up
and drop some paperwork off for you that

2247
01:45:22,141 --> 01:45:25,080
you have in advance.
Then you're going to look at the stop

2248
01:45:25,081 --> 01:45:29,040
and you're going to file a motion saying
that the stop was illegal because of x,

2249
01:45:29,041 --> 01:45:29,874
Y,
and z.

2250
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:32,820
Then you'll argue about the bail
conditions.

2251
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:35,940
Then you'll order,
you'll,

2252
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:40,380
you'll wait about six to eight weeks for
the results for the blood test results

2253
01:45:40,381 --> 01:45:45,150
to come back as soon as they come back
or even before you file a motion that

2254
01:45:45,151 --> 01:45:48,630
you've been working on saying that the
blood test results are problematic

2255
01:45:48,631 --> 01:45:53,580
because they were illegally drawn or the
facility is not accredited or the person

2256
01:45:53,581 --> 01:45:56,940
who administered the test is not
accredited or the machine has not been

2257
01:45:57,510 --> 01:45:58,710
maintained properly.

2258
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:03,030
At the same time you order the reports
for the machine maintenance because

2259
01:46:03,031 --> 01:46:05,070
you'll find that when they do the
blanks,

2260
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:09,090
sometimes they're not when they run them
through a gas chromatograph mass

2261
01:46:09,091 --> 01:46:13,020
spectrometer or whatever system they're
going to use when they do these samples.

2262
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:17,700
So I mean these are guys with technical
college to degrees or bachelor's degrees

2263
01:46:17,701 --> 01:46:20,670
that have taken a six to eight week
course and they might be pretty good at

2264
01:46:20,671 --> 01:46:22,260
it,
but there's still fuck ups.

2265
01:46:22,590 --> 01:46:25,680
And so sometimes things come in and
they're not sealed.

2266
01:46:25,681 --> 01:46:28,860
Sometimes there's a problem with the
vacuum cleaner that they use for the

2267
01:46:28,861 --> 01:46:33,861
blood draw and sometimes the,
sometimes the stuff that they put in the

2268
01:46:35,191 --> 01:46:40,191
Vacu tainer in advance to keep the blood
from coagulating is expired or has a

2269
01:46:43,321 --> 01:46:46,380
problem with it.
And you have to check that out.

2270
01:46:46,381 --> 01:46:49,800
So if you have an extremely rich
defendant,

2271
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:55,190
every thing from your fucking eye color
is in question.

2272
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:56,633
Basically the,

2273
01:46:57,700 --> 01:46:58,240
yeah,

2274
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:00,700
every step of the way where anything
happens,

2275
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:04,630
you have a question about it.
So wisdom machine properly and who

2276
01:47:04,631 --> 01:47:07,630
program these fucking machines?
Can I see the code?

2277
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:10,160
Because if I can't see the code to the
machine,

2278
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:15,930
Gee,
we can't say at all if this machine

2279
01:47:15,931 --> 01:47:18,240
works,
if we don't know the code.

2280
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:23,660
And for a lot of these devices,
the code is proprietary and they won't

2281
01:47:23,791 --> 01:47:28,320
give you the code.
So they won't allow you to know how some

2282
01:47:28,321 --> 01:47:30,720
of the machines that they use to watch
you work.

2283
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:33,780
So you can't,
as an attorney at war as a defendant,

2284
01:47:33,781 --> 01:47:37,290
you can't actually point to a problem
and say,

2285
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:40,260
see,
you didn't carry the one and you doubled

2286
01:47:40,261 --> 01:47:41,940
my fucking result.
Or,

2287
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,400
you know,
like this shows that it was,

2288
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:46,110
I'm patient four,
eight,

2289
01:47:46,111 --> 01:47:46,681
six,
three,

2290
01:47:46,681 --> 01:47:49,260
this is for this.
They sometimes they won't give you those

2291
01:47:49,261 --> 01:47:52,380
records or,
and so then you have a problem.

2292
01:47:52,381 --> 01:47:56,820
You hope actually that they don't give
you shit because when they do give you

2293
01:47:56,821 --> 01:47:58,290
shit,
it's proof that it's generally in

2294
01:47:58,291 --> 01:48:00,390
working order.
But when shit comes late,

2295
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:01,740
it means there's a fucking problem.

2296
01:48:02,070 --> 01:48:05,700
And that's when you know you smell blood
and you start to chase that down.

2297
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:08,010
You know,
so like,

2298
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:10,620
and then,
and then the next point you do is you go

2299
01:48:10,621 --> 01:48:14,040
and you try and settle the case and you
think here are the guidelines.

2300
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:16,440
Because most out of Uis guideline
offenses,

2301
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,900
most places,
because people get a first one and then

2302
01:48:18,901 --> 01:48:20,850
they get a second and a third and a
fourth and fifth.

2303
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:23,100
And even though the penalties go up,
it's crazy.

2304
01:48:23,101 --> 01:48:27,150
Cause the more out of Uis people have,
the less dangerous they tend to be

2305
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:31,470
during those adobe wys like sevens,
it'll hit park cars all fucking day,

2306
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:35,040
but they don't kill people.
Two's kill people.

2307
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,630
First offense,
drunk drivers,

2308
01:48:36,631 --> 01:48:39,240
they fucking kill people.
So,

2309
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:42,870
so people just get better at drunk
driving is absolutely they do.

2310
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:44,400
It's horrifying.
But yeah,

2311
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:46,360
they do make sense.
Perfect.

2312
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:46,610
Yeah.

2313
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:47,970
Yeah.
With everything in line and they take

2314
01:48:47,971 --> 01:48:50,880
certain roads and they drive slower,
they compensate for it.

2315
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:51,960
They're not,
I mean,

2316
01:48:51,961 --> 01:48:54,180
they're used to being drunk.
They're alcoholics,

2317
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:56,280
you know?
Dude,

2318
01:48:56,281 --> 01:48:57,710
that was terrifying.
Yeah.

2319
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,450
This,
this surgical precisely this to the way

2320
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:04,350
you broke down the process of,
and now what is the difference between a

2321
01:49:04,351 --> 01:49:09,351
rich person and someone who gets an
attorney assigned to them by the state.

2322
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,920
Okay.
Um,

2323
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:13,620
you want to get,
I mean,

2324
01:49:13,621 --> 01:49:16,080
you want to get like pick a crime.
Well,

2325
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,830
let's use the same crime.
Okay.

2326
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,700
Someone who's drunk driving because,
Oh,

2327
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:20,650
poor guy.
All right,

2328
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:22,020
let's pull over and you're handling
them.

2329
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:23,730
Okay.
We can't do all those things.

2330
01:49:23,731 --> 01:49:24,960
You want to know you can't do those
things.

2331
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:30,200
So what you have to do is you've got to
do everything that you can do on that

2332
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:33,570
list because in 90% of those,
Kate,

2333
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:37,290
of those times,
or maybe even 99% of the time,

2334
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:42,330
those avenues will be completely
fruitless.

2335
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:46,550
Those won't get you shit because route,
you know,

2336
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:49,810
stops routinely.
Rubber stamped warrants,

2337
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:54,130
rubber stamp.
And the machines are generally agreed to

2338
01:49:54,131 --> 01:49:56,890
be in working order.
And a lot of places there are statutes

2339
01:49:56,891 --> 01:50:00,580
meant to protect the you from even being
able to get this information.

2340
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:05,560
So Eh,
but things that really do work are like

2341
01:50:06,370 --> 01:50:11,370
bring their family to sentencing because
most people who are convicted of crimes

2342
01:50:11,381 --> 01:50:14,890
had been convicted of a compliment
crimes and nobody shows up for them

2343
01:50:14,891 --> 01:50:16,750
anymore and nobody gives a shit about
them.

2344
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:19,150
And what's going to happen is they're
going to go in and they're going to do

2345
01:50:19,151 --> 01:50:21,490
their time and they're going to get out
and nobody's going to give shit about

2346
01:50:21,491 --> 01:50:22,660
them.
Then they're going to do something else

2347
01:50:22,661 --> 01:50:25,240
and then you get to go back in.
But if you've got a family there,

2348
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:28,810
the judge can see,
will somebody still cares about this

2349
01:50:28,811 --> 01:50:29,440
asshole?

2350
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,300
Somebody still thinks there's some good
in them.

2351
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:34,840
I bet there's some good in them.
And I got a couple people who are

2352
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:37,540
willing to show up and watch him take
his medicine,

2353
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:41,410
watch him see that,
watch him admit he fucked up and

2354
01:50:41,411 --> 01:50:44,710
promised to try to be better.
So these guys are kind of on our side.

2355
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:48,670
These guys are going to try and help
this guy not come back here and that

2356
01:50:48,671 --> 01:50:52,000
will shorten your sentence.
If you have supportive people in your

2357
01:50:52,001 --> 01:50:54,850
side of the room,
that will shorten your sentence.

2358
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,400
Um,
yeah.

2359
01:50:57,430 --> 01:50:59,680
Things that are open to rich people like
you want it.

2360
01:50:59,681 --> 01:51:03,520
I mean all almost all expert witnesses
are horse.

2361
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:06,550
Like people.
People would ask me like,

2362
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:10,090
well how do you like how do you choose
an expert?

2363
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,500
And I'll be like,
I just,

2364
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:14,410
I just ask everybody else what kind of
expert they use.

2365
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,870
And they were like,
what if the expert says something you

2366
01:51:16,871 --> 01:51:18,520
don't want them to say,
I'm like,

2367
01:51:18,521 --> 01:51:21,580
that does not happen.
And they're like,

2368
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,360
do you tell the expert what to say?
No.

2369
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:30,840
The expert knows if the prosecution or
defense or plaintiff or defendant calls

2370
01:51:31,781 --> 01:51:33,430
them.
They know which side you're on.

2371
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:38,050
And miraculously,
every fucking expert I've ever offered

2372
01:51:38,051 --> 01:51:41,380
money to,
to give me their honest and completely

2373
01:51:41,381 --> 01:51:45,850
unbiased opinion has said I was right.
What are the odds?

2374
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:49,210
Every single fucking one.
He must really know how to pick quality

2375
01:51:49,211 --> 01:51:51,310
attorneys,
I guess quality,

2376
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:53,620
professional experts,
quality experts.

2377
01:51:53,650 --> 01:51:55,570
But yeah,
what I'm saying is like they're just,

2378
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:56,890
they're whores,
they're whores,

2379
01:51:56,950 --> 01:52:00,370
and then we'll say anything.
And there's a business in being a horse.

2380
01:52:00,371 --> 01:52:04,300
So like if you're looking for a guy
who's a a DNA expert or you're looking

2381
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:07,900
for a guy who was a chemical expert,
like you know the guy to call because

2382
01:52:07,901 --> 01:52:10,390
other friends who have used them on
similar cases.

2383
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:11,253
Yep.
And,

2384
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,960
and there are guys there,
I mean they're all whores.

2385
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:17,680
There are some guys who are solid
because whores do tell the truth.

2386
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:20,380
You know,
like horse do important work,

2387
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:25,180
but they are horse and you should never
forget that.

2388
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:29,050
That's something I think Republicans get
when they argue about climate change.

2389
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:33,400
That's why they don't listen to the
fucking billion scientists on one side

2390
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,720
because they know like,
oh yeah,

2391
01:52:34,721 --> 01:52:37,240
you can just buy a study.
They don't realize that these are the

2392
01:52:37,241 --> 01:52:40,810
studies that weren't bought and that you
should actually believe these,

2393
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:44,050
but they just,
they know how it is because they've seen

2394
01:52:44,051 --> 01:52:46,220
that happen over and over and over
again.

2395
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:51,050
Like Monsanto by studies and they marry
studies and attorneys do the same thing.

2396
01:52:51,051 --> 01:52:54,380
They get,
they hire an expert and miraculously the

2397
01:52:54,381 --> 01:52:56,810
expert just agrees with them every
fucking time.

2398
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:57,950
I don't know how it works.

2399
01:52:57,950 --> 01:53:01,700
Like I would expect that I would hire an
expert sometime and they would say,

2400
01:53:01,701 --> 01:53:02,850
you know,
Schmidt,

2401
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:04,340
you're wrong.
Uh,

2402
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:09,020
these fingerprints are a match,
but then never know.

2403
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:12,170
Now,
do you think that this is because I

2404
01:53:12,171 --> 01:53:13,700
mean,
are you communicating with these guys

2405
01:53:13,701 --> 01:53:14,840
beforehand?
Like when you,

2406
01:53:14,841 --> 01:53:16,340
when you hire an expert,
do you have any,

2407
01:53:16,610 --> 01:53:21,610
I never ever said anything to any of
them about how I wanted them to just say

2408
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:25,550
anything.
And how much do you pay in these guys?

2409
01:53:25,551 --> 01:53:27,410
Like say if you bring a guy who was a
fingerprints guy,

2410
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:28,520
if you,
okay,

2411
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:33,730
if you're public defender's office,
you can pay no more than a grand or

2412
01:53:34,131 --> 01:53:35,330
1500,
I think it is.

2413
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:39,050
And you got to pay it out of your own
pocket and then they'll reimburse you in

2414
01:53:39,051 --> 01:53:44,051
like six months after the trials done.
So you don't have experts functionally

2415
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:49,130
if you got money and expert can run yet
15 grand.

2416
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:50,620
Okay.

2417
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:52,540
And,
but it depends on the type of case.

2418
01:53:52,541 --> 01:53:56,680
If it's medical or if it's an end state,
the state will fly.

2419
01:53:56,681 --> 01:54:00,430
Like this is a beautiful thing.
If you throw piss on a guard,

2420
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:03,580
do you know it's hard for them to tell
that it's pissed,

2421
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:07,890
but it's a felony in most jurisdictions
to throw urine on uh,

2422
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:11,320
on security personnel at a prison.
It's called gassing,

2423
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:17,130
but it costs extra money because the,
there are actually very few experts who

2424
01:54:19,451 --> 01:54:21,520
can say that this is urine.

2425
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:23,430
Okay.

2426
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:28,320
This person through on them,
like the test for urine versus it's

2427
01:54:28,321 --> 01:54:32,190
just,
it costs money to fly someone to say

2428
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:37,230
that this guy did throw piss on this
guard and here's this scientist who can

2429
01:54:37,231 --> 01:54:40,320
say beyond a reasonable doubt that was
pis.

2430
01:54:41,190 --> 01:54:46,190
They really have to fly someone from
Philadelphia sometimes to Wisconsin to

2431
01:54:46,231 --> 01:54:51,180
say that was piss.
That's how fucked up our system is.

2432
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:56,880
That to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that it was pissed in a felony trial.

2433
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:01,860
We need a scientist,
so no wonder they're fucking horse

2434
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:06,480
because that's the shit we put.
Like we make them privy or part of our

2435
01:55:06,481 --> 01:55:10,380
little stupid disputes like that
continuously and it warps them just the

2436
01:55:10,381 --> 01:55:12,860
same way it warps everyone else.
Ooh,

2437
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,670
good God.
What a bleak picture.

2438
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:19,770
Well,
but the important thing to remember is

2439
01:55:19,771 --> 01:55:22,290
most people are outside and having fun
most of the time.

2440
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:25,230
Most of the time,
but not important because what if

2441
01:55:25,231 --> 01:55:29,100
something happens and you happen to be
driving while black and all of a sudden

2442
01:55:29,101 --> 01:55:31,320
you're in the same situation that you
described,

2443
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:35,100
right?
Where you wind up getting extracted from

2444
01:55:35,101 --> 01:55:36,720
this beautiful outside world.
Yeah.

2445
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,780
Well stuck in it.
That's something that we all have to do

2446
01:55:39,781 --> 01:55:43,020
something about.
And if anybody's got ideas,

2447
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:43,980
well I

2448
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,470
think talking about it is huge.
Um,

2449
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:50,430
I wasn't aware of it to the extent.
I mean obviously I have zero knowledge

2450
01:55:50,431 --> 01:55:51,900
of what it's like in Madison,
Wisconsin,

2451
01:55:51,901 --> 01:55:54,990
other than the few times I've visited.
So hearing you describe it and

2452
01:55:54,991 --> 01:55:58,470
especially zero knowledge of what it's
like inside the criminal justice system.

2453
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,990
But hearing you describe it,
it's,

2454
01:56:00,991 --> 01:56:02,520
uh,
it's,

2455
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:04,120
it's pretty disheartening.
It's,

2456
01:56:04,121 --> 01:56:05,280
it's,
it's atrocious.

2457
01:56:05,281 --> 01:56:07,640
It's,
it's scary and it seems like an

2458
01:56:07,641 --> 01:56:09,390
excusable.
It seems like if you're looking at the

2459
01:56:09,391 --> 01:56:13,350
raw data as far as like what happens to
be both the black and what happens with

2460
01:56:13,351 --> 01:56:16,080
her wife at first offenders,
it's garbage.

2461
01:56:16,350 --> 01:56:20,310
Scary.
And our best idea was teaching some

2462
01:56:20,311 --> 01:56:22,800
children to garden.
Oh,

2463
01:56:22,830 --> 01:56:23,950
I mean,
yeah.

2464
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:24,990
You know,
I was at a,

2465
01:56:24,991 --> 01:56:28,920
in yellowstone recently and um,
it was a really beautiful,

2466
01:56:28,921 --> 01:56:31,770
but one of the things it was freaking me
out was that it was,

2467
01:56:31,771 --> 01:56:35,700
um,
created by an act of Congress in 1872.

2468
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:36,781
And,
uh,

2469
01:56:36,781 --> 01:56:37,950
I was thinking,
good Lord,

2470
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,110
like I'm 1872,
you know,

2471
01:56:40,111 --> 01:56:42,450
I was alive in 1972.
That's not that long ago.

2472
01:56:42,550 --> 01:56:46,620
That's fairly recently.
And then I was thinking that's only

2473
01:56:46,621 --> 01:56:51,621
seven years after slavery was abolished.
And then I looked it up and it's 14

2474
01:56:52,201 --> 01:56:56,400
years before the creation of the
gasoline powered automobile.

2475
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:57,533
I'm like,
that.

2476
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:59,760
This is amazing.
Like,

2477
01:56:59,761 --> 01:57:02,700
this is amazing how recent all this is.
Yeah.

2478
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,660
And um,
I was talking with someone,

2479
01:57:07,110 --> 01:57:08,670
oh,
Byron bowers,

2480
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:13,170
do you know Byron area standup comedian?
And Byron was talking about,

2481
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:15,780
um,
Byron's black and he was talking about

2482
01:57:15,781 --> 01:57:20,781
his grandmother remembering his great
grandmother telling her about the

2483
01:57:21,931 --> 01:57:25,350
invention of the cotton gin.
Eli Whitney.

2484
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:28,770
Yeah.
Like she was around for that.

2485
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:31,440
That's fucked up.
And you know,

2486
01:57:31,441 --> 01:57:36,120
he was talking about different relatives
that he had,

2487
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:37,890
you know,
great grandmothers and what have you

2488
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:41,540
that were slaves and um,
you know,

2489
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:42,600
really hits home.

2490
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,630
We go,
that is so like for us,

2491
01:57:45,631 --> 01:57:46,630
we grow up.
And when,

2492
01:57:46,631 --> 01:57:49,350
when you were a little kid and you hear
1865,

2493
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:49,801
you go,
wow,

2494
01:57:49,801 --> 01:57:53,340
that was fucking forever ago.
But as life goes on,

2495
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:56,800
the perspective sort of comes clearer
and clearer and a focus when you

2496
01:57:56,801 --> 01:57:57,631
realize,
oh my God,

2497
01:57:57,631 --> 01:57:59,680
like that was a blink ago.
Yeah.

2498
01:57:59,681 --> 01:58:02,700
1965 was essentially a cultural blink
ago.

2499
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:07,190
And when you look at like the history of
China or the history of England even,

2500
01:58:07,410 --> 01:58:09,600
I mean,
this massive long history.

2501
01:58:09,601 --> 01:58:13,230
And then the United States,
we know 1865 is fucking nothing.

2502
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,190
Yeah,
we're,

2503
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:15,571
I mean,
yeah,

2504
01:58:15,571 --> 01:58:19,560
we're really young country where there's
countries that are seven times as old as

2505
01:58:19,561 --> 01:58:24,561
we are and I mean
from all I got it.

2506
01:58:25,310 --> 01:58:27,930
I want to say one more thing about that
criminal justice system.

2507
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:32,250
It's weird because yeah,
gas powered automobile electricity,

2508
01:58:32,490 --> 01:58:37,490
telecommunications space travel and to
slavery and we still have fundamentally

2509
01:58:38,191 --> 01:58:41,830
the same criminal justice system.
Why we didn't improve

2510
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,350
on it one bit.
We added some,

2511
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:47,770
we added a couple things,
but it's not fundamentally different.

2512
01:58:47,771 --> 01:58:50,530
It was designed,
it's the Dana Law,

2513
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:54,880
it's fucking vikings used to use it and
then it became the English common law,

2514
01:58:55,150 --> 01:58:58,900
like what should it be?
What do you think?

2515
01:58:58,901 --> 01:59:01,870
Like is there an ideal system with
someone as a proposed?

2516
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:02,741
No,
no.

2517
01:59:02,741 --> 01:59:06,520
I don't think there's an ideal system,
but I do think that right now a country

2518
01:59:06,521 --> 01:59:09,070
of 346 million people.
Is it that lesson?

2519
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,410
Yeah.
There's more than 300 million counting

2520
01:59:11,411 --> 01:59:12,460
Mexicans.
Yeah.

2521
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:15,040
They're people.
346 million?

2522
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:16,120
I think so,
yeah.

2523
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:19,010
What is that like?
Is that the official shout?

2524
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:21,340
God dammit.
But how many illegal aliens are supposed

2525
01:59:21,341 --> 01:59:22,750
to be here?
Well,

2526
01:59:22,751 --> 01:59:24,700
none are supposed to be here.
I mean,

2527
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:25,930
but allegedly.
Okay.

2528
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:29,500
How many are allegedly here?
How many have been counted account of,

2529
01:59:29,501 --> 01:59:34,501
how am I supposed to be here by God's
law that go wherever they want and now I

2530
01:59:34,601 --> 01:59:36,890
think they,
I don't have a problem with immigration.

2531
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:39,190
It sounds like you do know putting in
back heels.

2532
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:42,400
I mean,
I think we should let everybody in wants

2533
01:59:42,401 --> 01:59:44,500
to come.
It's kind of the idea of the country.

2534
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:46,420
Not everyone.
You don't want an orange county.

2535
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:49,130
Yeah.
Want to fucking die if more people moved

2536
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,200
there.
Oh yeah.

2537
01:59:50,410 --> 01:59:53,650
Well I mean for Nebraska has got room.
It does.

2538
01:59:53,651 --> 01:59:55,570
If you fly over the country,
you realize there's a lot of spots.

2539
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:57,340
Yeah,
there's a lot of spots and we're kind of

2540
01:59:57,341 --> 01:59:59,590
being dicks.
Like there's some people who like,

2541
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:03,430
I don't want to live in Libya and
fucking come over here.

2542
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:04,293
Well,
um,

2543
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,730
uh,
president trump's going to pull a nice

2544
02:00:06,731 --> 02:00:09,280
wall and stop,
stop everything.

2545
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:13,810
See what I think we should do is I think
we should fucking put the feelers out,

2546
02:00:13,811 --> 02:00:16,930
put the vibes out.
And then if we see like a population

2547
02:00:16,931 --> 02:00:19,660
that gets treated like shit,
we should fucking just steal them.

2548
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:21,400
Just like,
you know,

2549
02:00:21,401 --> 02:00:23,560
there's countries where it's illegal to
be homosexual,

2550
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:27,010
but you know,
like we got room,

2551
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,200
we should just be like,
Hey,

2552
02:00:28,201 --> 02:00:30,790
can you call your homos?
We'll take all every single one.

2553
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:33,190
Usually they make a lot of money.
They all have discretionary income.

2554
02:00:33,191 --> 02:00:35,140
Cause most of the time they don't have
kids to go for the economy.

2555
02:00:35,141 --> 02:00:36,360
Why the fuck not,
you know,

2556
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:38,440
come on over.
What do you think is going to happen if

2557
02:00:38,441 --> 02:00:41,890
trump becomes president and we have the
social justice warrior president of

2558
02:00:41,891 --> 02:00:43,920
Canada,
they're prime ministers.

2559
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:46,270
Like he's there.
They're going to explore the idea of

2560
02:00:46,271 --> 02:00:48,580
gender neutral identity cards.
Like,

2561
02:00:48,581 --> 02:00:49,330
okay,
frogs.

2562
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:50,410
Yeah,
he can't just like,

2563
02:00:50,411 --> 02:00:52,810
what do you tell the cops mister or
misses?

2564
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:53,680
Um,
z.

2565
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:54,460
Z.
H.

2566
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,020
E.
E what jail did we put in you?

2567
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:59,110
We put you in the gender neutral jail or
do you go into men's?

2568
02:00:59,260 --> 02:00:59,981
Do you have a deck?
Dude,

2569
02:00:59,981 --> 02:01:00,701
can I say,
okay,

2570
02:01:00,701 --> 02:01:01,940
you're a guy.
I mean it is,

2571
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:06,310
it's kind of juvenile that we like,
oh you murdered somebody but you have a

2572
02:01:06,311 --> 02:01:07,990
pain.
It's you murdered somebody but you have

2573
02:01:07,991 --> 02:01:10,030
a vagina.
You have to go to separate facilities.

2574
02:01:10,031 --> 02:01:12,040
Murderers.
Well they should because otherwise

2575
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:13,830
they'll fuck.
And the crepe murder of babies,

2576
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:17,080
I mean,
they're not all going to fuck.

2577
02:01:17,110 --> 02:01:19,950
And some of them it's kind of like,
well why do you,

2578
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:22,240
why do we even care?
Cause they're going to fuck each other.

2579
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:23,830
Yeah.
But dudes are gonna fuck dudes.

2580
02:01:23,831 --> 02:01:25,300
And that's the punishment for being in
jail.

2581
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,760
And if you lock people up with hot
criminal girls,

2582
02:01:27,761 --> 02:01:29,140
then you get a porno movie.
I mean,

2583
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:30,940
yeah,
that caged cheat.

2584
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:34,280
You run cage t have cake.
It's just,

2585
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:36,520
that's what it is.
They're just going to bang each other.

2586
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:38,320
All right.
I agree with the policy then.

2587
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:39,980
If,
if it results in women

2588
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,900
in prison films.
Yeah.

2589
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:45,180
It's always the guard.
So he's the female guard that gets

2590
02:01:45,181 --> 02:01:47,420
reduced like that Tupac Song.
Oh yeah.

2591
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:50,750
Remember
when not get free.

2592
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:56,270
He was seduced in the guard.
I mean,

2593
02:01:56,410 --> 02:01:58,280
you know,
there was a guard,

2594
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:03,500
it was like some movie about a guard
that had a relationship with some guy

2595
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:06,560
who was a prisoner.
This dude could apparently lie on his

2596
02:02:06,561 --> 02:02:10,400
back without touching his penis.
He can make his dick or rack and he

2597
02:02:10,401 --> 02:02:14,000
could ejaculate.
But he had time to practice.

2598
02:02:14,030 --> 02:02:18,200
Yeah,
but I mean that is amazing what it is.

2599
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:20,270
Guy Put,
see these urban myths,

2600
02:02:20,271 --> 02:02:21,890
man,
it's hard to tell.

2601
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:23,960
There's no camera on this dude deck,
right?

2602
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:25,310
I mean,
yeah,

2603
02:02:25,311 --> 02:02:27,620
if he could really do it.
Did he die in prison?

2604
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:30,030
Um,
I don't know.

2605
02:02:30,031 --> 02:02:32,210
It's a good question.
Cause if you could do that and you

2606
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:35,240
didn't die in prison,
somebody probably paid you money to film

2607
02:02:35,241 --> 02:02:35,450
it.

2608
02:02:35,450 --> 02:02:36,261
All right,
let me ask you this.

2609
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:38,120
When it's a subject to restitution,
do you think,

2610
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:38,880
Gosh,
that guy,

2611
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:42,440
I'll get off with time served plus
restitution.

2612
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:47,470
If you can make Dick porn and jail,
like say if that guy didn't do anything

2613
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,340
too terrible,
maybe just robbed a bunch of liquor

2614
02:02:49,341 --> 02:02:53,390
stores or something like that and all of
a sudden he's in jail and he realizes

2615
02:02:53,391 --> 02:02:57,650
that he's practiced by himself in the
zen room so long that he could get his

2616
02:02:57,651 --> 02:03:00,860
dick hard and come all over himself.
People would pay money to see that.

2617
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:02,840
Yeah.
So if he starts like his own,

2618
02:03:02,841 --> 02:03:03,470
uh,
I,

2619
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:06,080
I just,
I myself website from jail.

2620
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:08,440
Webcam service makes a lot of money.
Yeah.

2621
02:03:08,530 --> 02:03:09,920
It gives it to the victims.
Yeah.

2622
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:12,080
No,
I mean I think it's constructive.

2623
02:03:12,110 --> 02:03:14,120
I think it's helpful.
I think he should start by,

2624
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:16,550
I think anyone who's interested in doing
that,

2625
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:20,390
whatever correctional facility there in,
perhaps write to the judge that

2626
02:03:20,391 --> 02:03:24,200
sentenced you and request that you do
the same or just an opportunity.

2627
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:27,980
I have no doubt that people can do that
because if someone can have a wet dream,

2628
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:30,680
that means their fantasy is allowing
them to ejaculate.

2629
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:33,170
Yeah.
So I think there's some people that have

2630
02:03:33,171 --> 02:03:35,330
done some really amazing things with
their mind,

2631
02:03:35,331 --> 02:03:37,220
right?
Like there's people that practice

2632
02:03:37,221 --> 02:03:40,130
Kundalini Yoga and they get to some
place where they can have some trance

2633
02:03:40,131 --> 02:03:42,920
and they have psychedelic states.
I'm not,

2634
02:03:43,550 --> 02:03:45,380
I believe it.
I'm not skeptical.

2635
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:46,940
I mean,
I bet you could do it.

2636
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:51,560
Like I bet that sounds like something
where if you practiced,

2637
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:54,260
if you just waited,
cause there's dudes who just in their

2638
02:03:54,261 --> 02:03:55,760
pants,
when women walk up to him,

2639
02:03:56,050 --> 02:03:59,060
whoa.
Like this is just like a little bit more

2640
02:03:59,061 --> 02:03:59,990
removed.
Right.

2641
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,690
The fact that that dude did it for the
guard.

2642
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:05,430
Kapow let her know what's up.
Yeah.

2643
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:07,070
This is a kind of power I'm dealing
with.

2644
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:10,250
Yeah.
Like on command and salad bar must

2645
02:04:10,251 --> 02:04:13,370
happen because that's what I'll also
happened up in upstate New York.

2646
02:04:13,371 --> 02:04:14,770
When those guys get free and they,
uh,

2647
02:04:14,790 --> 02:04:16,580
those murders,
they tracked him to Canada.

2648
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:19,490
The woman was supposed to let them out
where they escaped and the woman was

2649
02:04:19,491 --> 02:04:21,140
supposed to meet them outside.
Remember that?

2650
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:23,450
Yup.
That was the same situation.

2651
02:04:23,451 --> 02:04:24,760
Homely lady.
Oh yeah.

2652
02:04:24,761 --> 02:04:25,730
Yeah.
Fairly handsome dude.

2653
02:04:25,930 --> 02:04:27,560
Thought were going to have relationship.
Yep.

2654
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:28,663
I,
uh,

2655
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:32,750
when I first started visiting prisons
for clients,

2656
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:36,440
uh,
this guy who was a former,

2657
02:04:36,441 --> 02:04:38,100
I think it was secretary of

2658
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:42,150
the Department of Corrections,
he was our criminal law professor ran us

2659
02:04:42,151 --> 02:04:45,690
through a whole bunch of shit we have to
watch out for when we go into prison.

2660
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:48,810
And one of them was inmates trying to
seduce you.

2661
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:50,070
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

2662
02:04:50,330 --> 02:04:51,850
Even dudes.
Yeah.

2663
02:04:52,030 --> 02:04:54,240
Yeah.
Well they got nothing going on.

2664
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:55,740
Right.
Just try it.

2665
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:56,641
Yeah.
No judge.

2666
02:04:56,641 --> 02:04:57,474
No.
Yeah.

2667
02:04:57,780 --> 02:05:02,780
And I mean
the way he ran it through us like to us

2668
02:05:03,091 --> 02:05:04,530
was like a little crazy.
He's like,

2669
02:05:04,570 --> 02:05:05,970
Yep,
they're going to try to,

2670
02:05:05,971 --> 02:05:07,470
uh,
they're going to try to,

2671
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:08,850
uh,
sexually input too.

2672
02:05:08,851 --> 02:05:11,100
And you,
they're going to try to walk on Zip that

2673
02:05:11,101 --> 02:05:13,180
flies and then we importuning.
Yeah.

2674
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:14,670
Ooh,
I've never heard that word before.

2675
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:16,880
I never heard anybody use that.
Yeah.

2676
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:22,470
Cause he was saying that they would
unzip their flies potentially and then

2677
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:26,910
take advantage of the fact that we
didn't say anything about it the next

2678
02:05:26,911 --> 02:05:29,460
time
to call.

2679
02:05:29,490 --> 02:05:33,960
Basically to get us to commit a minor
offense so that we,

2680
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:38,961
or break a little rule or lead us a
little bit down the path and then next

2681
02:05:39,451 --> 02:05:41,760
time they would try to take their dicks
out.

2682
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:45,030
Okay.
So if you don't call him out on having

2683
02:05:45,031 --> 02:05:47,040
his fly down,
it's an offense.

2684
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:48,720
No,
no,

2685
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,660
but it's,
it's not like a crime.

2686
02:05:51,661 --> 02:05:53,690
It's not like a rule violation.
Okay.

2687
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:56,860
But if he's got social,
if it's,

2688
02:05:57,240 --> 02:06:00,150
and the,
they'll sit differently like,

2689
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:02,190
ah,
like if someone sits there with their

2690
02:06:02,191 --> 02:06:03,450
fly open,
you know,

2691
02:06:03,451 --> 02:06:05,820
and it's like this and their crotches on
display,

2692
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:08,830
they're letting you know they've got
some Dick for,

2693
02:06:08,831 --> 02:06:09,630
so they're like,
yeah,

2694
02:06:09,630 --> 02:06:10,171
they're like,
hey,

2695
02:06:10,171 --> 02:06:12,180
by the way,
there's some Dick in here.

2696
02:06:12,330 --> 02:06:17,330
And then next time they'll be more,
cause there's a lot of sociopath's in

2697
02:06:18,481 --> 02:06:19,560
prison.
Oh,

2698
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:22,620
a lot.
Because a lot for a lot of people,

2699
02:06:22,621 --> 02:06:26,100
what it comes down to is the sentencing
because they're guilty as shit.

2700
02:06:26,130 --> 02:06:28,080
There's a lot of witnesses,
you know,

2701
02:06:28,170 --> 02:06:30,090
and they don't have,
they're not made of money.

2702
02:06:30,091 --> 02:06:34,740
So they can't pay some expert to write a
report saying that jail would hurt their

2703
02:06:34,741 --> 02:06:38,130
feelings,
which they fucking do if you have money.

2704
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:41,430
Um,
it comes down to a lot of,

2705
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:43,410
uh,
being able to take ownership of what

2706
02:06:43,411 --> 02:06:47,880
happened and what you did.
And a lot of sociopaths are in prison

2707
02:06:47,881 --> 02:06:51,690
because they're too stupid to listen to
how everybody else apologizes.

2708
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:56,160
So sociopath's will say something like,
you know,

2709
02:06:56,700 --> 02:07:01,380
I'm sorry that I played a part in all of
this or you know,

2710
02:07:01,381 --> 02:07:03,690
I'm not gonna,
I'm not going to put myself in

2711
02:07:03,691 --> 02:07:05,820
situations like this anymore.
Your honor,

2712
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,250
when they're being convicted of beating
the shit out of somebody,

2713
02:07:08,251 --> 02:07:09,630
they'll say,
I'm not going to put myself in

2714
02:07:09,631 --> 02:07:12,870
situations like this.
Sounds like they're taking ownership,

2715
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:17,520
but put in a situation just means you're
one small part of this fucking

2716
02:07:17,521 --> 02:07:22,521
situation.
Multiple aggressors and loud noises and

2717
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:26,190
rankin.
So it's,

2718
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:30,090
and to somebody that is making the
apology,

2719
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:34,200
it sounds like it works,
but to a room full of people that hear

2720
02:07:34,201 --> 02:07:36,460
nothing but apologies all day

2721
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:37,630
we'd go,
oh,

2722
02:07:37,631 --> 02:07:40,000
he's going to be back.
And that's how,

2723
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:43,600
and the judges listen for that shit very
intently.

2724
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:48,960
There's ways to fuck up and apology and
the only people who fuck up,

2725
02:07:49,301 --> 02:07:54,301
the apologies in that specific way are
almost completely incapable of putting

2726
02:07:55,211 --> 02:08:00,010
themselves in anybody else's shoes and
those types of people.

2727
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:04,330
And I tend to do certain types of things
where it's,

2728
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:05,980
they're always out for themselves.
Me,

2729
02:08:05,981 --> 02:08:06,790
me,
me.

2730
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:09,460
Why does he get to do that?
Why can't I do that?

2731
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:12,310
Like that Shit like that child is
bullshit.

2732
02:08:12,311 --> 02:08:14,520
Self centered,
selfish or at all.

2733
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:17,500
But they're an adult.
That's just what a sociopath is.

2734
02:08:17,501 --> 02:08:19,420
It's not that impressive.
It's not like,

2735
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:22,120
you know,
fucking silence of the lambs or some

2736
02:08:22,121 --> 02:08:23,830
shit.
It's just super selfish.

2737
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:27,100
Super inconsiderate of the ramifications
of their actions.

2738
02:08:27,490 --> 02:08:29,500
And they are just,
and they,

2739
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:35,350
they don't even know how to relate to
the rest of us because they don't care.

2740
02:08:35,690 --> 02:08:39,120
I don't care to like,
we're just robots to,

2741
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:42,280
you know,
in your experience dealing with so many

2742
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:43,990
of these different people and so many
different criminals,

2743
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,670
do you,
do you think it's a nature thing or a

2744
02:08:45,671 --> 02:08:47,110
nurture thing?
Nurture.

2745
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:49,030
Yeah,
it's nurture.

2746
02:08:49,310 --> 02:08:52,330
I mean,
there are some,

2747
02:08:52,450 --> 02:08:53,860
I mean,
some broken folks,

2748
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:56,620
there's some,
some people are born evil.

2749
02:08:56,980 --> 02:09:00,070
You just like,
some people are born with bad kidneys,

2750
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:02,440
right?
So some people were born like,

2751
02:09:02,441 --> 02:09:04,990
didn't they say the Jeffrey Dahmer?
It wasn't a good example.

2752
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:09,810
Or of a guy who allegedly had a pretty
stable childhood with loving parents and

2753
02:09:09,811 --> 02:09:11,560
became a serial killer.
Yeah.

2754
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,880
But,
but you don't know,

2755
02:09:12,881 --> 02:09:14,140
right?
Yeah.

2756
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:16,020
Like they're going to say they beat the
shit.

2757
02:09:16,350 --> 02:09:17,860
Fuck them.
Like they're going to be like,

2758
02:09:17,861 --> 02:09:18,431
no,
no,

2759
02:09:18,431 --> 02:09:21,700
we did them the same way.
A Charles Manson and Ted Bundys moms did

2760
02:09:21,701 --> 02:09:22,720
them.
No,

2761
02:09:22,721 --> 02:09:23,620
you're not going to say that.

2762
02:09:24,130 --> 02:09:25,990
But yeah,
I mean,

2763
02:09:25,991 --> 02:09:29,950
people who do that generally have kind
of similar histories.

2764
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:32,350
Well,
if you think about the way a human being

2765
02:09:32,710 --> 02:09:36,010
could vary the way we behave,
you could be like the most beautiful,

2766
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:38,560
generous kind,
caring person.

2767
02:09:38,590 --> 02:09:43,420
Or you could be a brutal dictator in the
Congo and chopping people's arms off.

2768
02:09:43,421 --> 02:09:46,060
And you could be either one of those is
still be a human being.

2769
02:09:46,150 --> 02:09:47,410
Yeah.
So if you,

2770
02:09:47,411 --> 02:09:50,950
if you think about that and you think
about the conditions that you have to

2771
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:55,240
sort of adapt to and if you were growing
up at some hellacious condition,

2772
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:58,210
you adapted to that helacious condition
and it is,

2773
02:09:58,211 --> 02:10:01,060
you are literally a product of society
now.

2774
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:06,040
When you come across people like that
because you're in the criminal defense

2775
02:10:06,041 --> 02:10:08,410
attorney world and you have to represent
these people,

2776
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:12,070
do you,
do you try to think like is there a way

2777
02:10:12,071 --> 02:10:14,350
to fix this guy?
I mean do you put that in your head or

2778
02:10:14,351 --> 02:10:17,260
do you just go and try to win?
I try.

2779
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:18,730
Well,
when I get,

2780
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:22,720
when I would get them to do the
apologies because one of,

2781
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:25,420
I mean the thing is like for a lot of
these guys,

2782
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:28,090
too many witnesses,
too much of a record.

2783
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:30,490
It's coming down in his fucking apology,
right?

2784
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:34,070
It's coming down to our plan for what
we're going to do and

2785
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:37,250
talking with them and coming up with a
reasonable plan about what they're going

2786
02:10:37,251 --> 02:10:42,251
to do after jail or what they could do
instead of jail and addressing like,

2787
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:45,200
why would they w they did something
wrong.

2788
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:46,550
Okay.
Why was it wrong?

2789
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:51,560
Like I would go through with my clients
a lot of the times if I wasn't sure that

2790
02:10:51,561 --> 02:10:53,060
they were getting it and I would be
like,

2791
02:10:53,061 --> 02:10:54,710
okay,
so you're going to have to give an

2792
02:10:54,711 --> 02:10:56,780
apology to the judge.
You're going to have to tell them that

2793
02:10:56,781 --> 02:10:58,490
what you did is wrong.
You're going to have to tell them that

2794
02:10:58,491 --> 02:11:00,560
you know that it was wrong and you're
gonna have to tell him,

2795
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:05,030
you know why it was wrong.
So why is it wrong to hit your

2796
02:11:05,031 --> 02:11:05,864
girlfriend?

2797
02:11:07,650 --> 02:11:08,483
Uh,

2798
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:11,290
she doesn't want me to.
Well,

2799
02:11:11,291 --> 02:11:12,440
okay.
All right.

2800
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:14,050
There's one,
uh,

2801
02:11:14,051 --> 02:11:16,300
when you hit your girlfriend,
what are the police have to do?

2802
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:19,930
They have to show up and they have to
arrest me.

2803
02:11:19,990 --> 02:11:22,120
Where you nice to them?
No.

2804
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:24,850
Do you think they like that?
No.

2805
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:28,630
Do you think now it would be the time to
apologize for being a dick to them when

2806
02:11:28,631 --> 02:11:31,930
they were just doing their jobs?
Yeah.

2807
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:34,180
Okay.
But now say it in a different way.

2808
02:11:34,181 --> 02:11:38,800
Say it in a nice way and then I made
them say it in a nice like then you have

2809
02:11:38,801 --> 02:11:42,280
to really coach them through this and do
you let them know like listen to your

2810
02:11:42,281 --> 02:11:45,070
freedom may ride on whether or not
you're believable.

2811
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:45,933
Yup.
Yup.

2812
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:48,570
And I most important performance,
I would tell him like you,

2813
02:11:48,970 --> 02:11:52,390
you're not going to lie up there.
Everything you say is going to be true.

2814
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:57,720
We just need to make you fucking
recognize you for just a couple minutes.

2815
02:11:57,850 --> 02:12:01,540
You got to recognize this situation
cause you can't lie out there.

2816
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:03,640
They hear too many lies.
They don't like lies.

2817
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:06,130
Just it's like George Michael and
freedom.

2818
02:12:06,131 --> 02:12:10,150
Like take a lie and make it true.
A lot of times I would ask quote George

2819
02:12:10,150 --> 02:12:10,331
Michael,
yeah,

2820
02:12:10,331 --> 02:12:10,810
I did

2821
02:12:10,810 --> 02:12:11,920
that Song of freedom.
Yeah,

2822
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:13,370
it's a good song.
It is a good song,

2823
02:12:13,371 --> 02:12:14,000
right?
Yeah.

2824
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,920
Good on you for admitting that.
A lot of the people,

2825
02:12:15,930 --> 02:12:18,380
they shy away from giving George Michael
the props he deserves.

2826
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:18,710
Yeah.

2827
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:22,160
But I would use like take these lies and
make them true.

2828
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:24,650
I would use that on my clients and he's
saying that,

2829
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:26,030
no,
I'm a terrible.

2830
02:12:26,031 --> 02:12:30,720
So no,
I can't take these labs and may can

2831
02:12:30,721 --> 02:12:34,400
choose.
We have to.

2832
02:12:37,170 --> 02:12:38,530
There we go.
Um,

2833
02:12:38,970 --> 02:12:41,490
that's a great God damn song.
You know,

2834
02:12:41,491 --> 02:12:44,160
it's the best.
You can't hear it on the Youtube.

2835
02:12:44,161 --> 02:12:45,570
Right.
We will get pulled,

2836
02:12:45,571 --> 02:12:46,260
right?
Yeah.

2837
02:12:46,260 --> 02:12:48,570
Only we can hear it.
Well,

2838
02:12:48,571 --> 02:12:50,340
listen,
if you see the video,

2839
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:52,920
this is the best part about that song.
That was one of those songs.

2840
02:12:52,921 --> 02:12:54,570
It was made by the video.
Yeah.

2841
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:56,900
Yeah.
Because he's got it.

2842
02:12:57,090 --> 02:12:58,590
But God damn,
these girls are hot.

2843
02:12:58,620 --> 02:13:00,930
Yep.
So much hotness.

2844
02:13:00,990 --> 02:13:03,240
Naomi Campbell,
Christy Turlington,

2845
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:06,090
some of those girls are still hanging in
there.

2846
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:09,240
Yeah.
In my world.

2847
02:13:09,450 --> 02:13:10,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2848
02:13:10,771 --> 02:13:15,771
This is a tremendous video.
Amazing what cemetery and bone structure

2849
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:19,230
does for the emotions.
Beautiful.

2850
02:13:19,231 --> 02:13:22,500
Full Lips and looking at pretty people.
It's fucking great.

2851
02:13:22,650 --> 02:13:24,090
It is.
It's amazing.

2852
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:26,790
But what I do is I would,
I'd be like,

2853
02:13:26,791 --> 02:13:30,810
so they're not going to let you out
because you don't have a job.

2854
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:31,883
Right.

2855
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:37,200
And you've never been in the community
with more than this for more than this

2856
02:13:37,201 --> 02:13:39,540
length of time without doing this.
And I'd be like,

2857
02:13:39,690 --> 02:13:43,680
well we can't lie to him and tell him
like I would make a list of shit that I

2858
02:13:43,681 --> 02:13:46,650
wish was true and I'd be like,
one of these things,

2859
02:13:46,651 --> 02:13:51,600
can I fucking just make true like can I
get this person to do these job

2860
02:13:51,601 --> 02:13:53,520
applications?
Yeah.

2861
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:55,470
Yeah.
I could totally do that.

2862
02:13:55,471 --> 02:13:59,100
Like if I could bail him out for it,
like if I can get him to make his bail,

2863
02:13:59,101 --> 02:14:03,390
if I can get his bail low enough and
then I can get him to submit job

2864
02:14:03,391 --> 02:14:08,391
applications every single week.
It was a lie when I came up with it a

2865
02:14:10,590 --> 02:14:13,710
couple minutes ago,
but in six months when this case finally

2866
02:14:13,711 --> 02:14:17,940
goes in front of the judge,
he'll probably have a job and they would

2867
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:20,010
like,
you just think about some shit.

2868
02:14:20,011 --> 02:14:22,620
You want to be true,
figure out how to make it true.

2869
02:14:22,830 --> 02:14:26,040
And you know,
like maybe he's got to have his kids

2870
02:14:26,041 --> 02:14:28,830
back or maybe he's had to have a better
relationship with his kids,

2871
02:14:28,831 --> 02:14:31,890
which means you start right in the
fucking letters now because in six

2872
02:14:31,891 --> 02:14:36,600
months have them show up.
Like just cause the thing is like,

2873
02:14:36,601 --> 02:14:39,150
yeah,
it's a lie if you have no intention of

2874
02:14:39,151 --> 02:14:41,790
making it true and we wouldn't say in an
advance,

2875
02:14:41,791 --> 02:14:43,350
I would just be like,
well you know,

2876
02:14:43,530 --> 02:14:45,180
so do you feel like you're coaching
these guys,

2877
02:14:45,181 --> 02:14:49,200
not just through their trial but maybe
through their understanding of the

2878
02:14:49,201 --> 02:14:52,770
implications of their crime as well?
What are you in some way sort of

2879
02:14:52,771 --> 02:14:54,710
educating them and to,
you know,

2880
02:14:54,750 --> 02:14:56,040
cause if they have to be honest about
it,

2881
02:14:56,380 --> 02:15:00,930
they have to kind of be maybe educated
about the impact of their choices.

2882
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:02,120
Yeah.
Yeah,

2883
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:04,640
I would,
I mean to the extent that I thought it

2884
02:15:04,641 --> 02:15:05,660
was appropriate,
like,

2885
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:08,930
because I'm in a position of power,
you know,

2886
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:12,350
emotional abuse is not proper,
you know,

2887
02:15:12,351 --> 02:15:13,184
like,

2888
02:15:13,890 --> 02:15:15,920
like abusing them,
like insulting them or something like

2889
02:15:15,921 --> 02:15:16,121
that.
Yeah.

2890
02:15:16,121 --> 02:15:19,520
Like insulting them and there's people
where you would completely want to when

2891
02:15:19,521 --> 02:15:21,620
salt them.
It's just not appropriate because

2892
02:15:21,621 --> 02:15:26,000
they're such terrible monster.
But what do you do?

2893
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:27,830
It's you're in one of those situations.

2894
02:15:28,170 --> 02:15:29,100
Yeah,
I've had,

2895
02:15:29,690 --> 02:15:30,523
uh,
there's,

2896
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:35,540
I've had some guys that make my skin
crawl and like I've sat next to people,

2897
02:15:35,850 --> 02:15:36,683
you know,

2898
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:42,410
done horrible things to people where
they don't make my skin crawl and yet

2899
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:46,400
these other people are just so far
beyond them in terms of like,

2900
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,480
we don't like,
we should probably lock him up forever.

2901
02:15:51,380 --> 02:15:53,720
Like you can't do anything because you,
you,

2902
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:55,970
you sort of have a mandate,
right?

2903
02:15:55,971 --> 02:15:58,430
You have to win.
I have to make them beat me.

2904
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:00,463
Oh,

2905
02:16:01,310 --> 02:16:02,600
I mean,
do you drink after work?

2906
02:16:02,601 --> 02:16:03,950
Would you like,
no.

2907
02:16:04,160 --> 02:16:05,150
No,
you didn't.

2908
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:07,070
No,
because if you do,

2909
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:10,490
then you don't stop.
There were,

2910
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:12,610
there's a bunch of bars right by that
courthouse.

2911
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:14,780
But imagine you were just wanting to
escape.

2912
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:16,490
Yeah.
Well you just want to booze it up.

2913
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:18,500
Well because the thing is,
as a defense attorney,

2914
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:22,850
you're going to get your ass handed to
you so many fucking times that if I

2915
02:16:22,851 --> 02:16:26,810
drank one time for every time,
I didn't like what a judge decided,

2916
02:16:27,590 --> 02:16:30,100
I would have been dead seven ago.
Did

2917
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,210
you get high?
No,

2918
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:32,510
he didn't do nothing.
No.

2919
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:35,050
Just went home pot pies and dealt with
it.

2920
02:16:35,230 --> 02:16:37,210
Yup.
Fuck man.

2921
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:40,810
I went out on the weekends.
And you did stand up and you started

2922
02:16:40,811 --> 02:16:42,340
doing standup while you were an
attorney.

2923
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:43,233
Yeah.
Yeah.

2924
02:16:44,110 --> 02:16:46,720
Well I've never seen you stand up dude.
But you're a smart guy so I can't

2925
02:16:46,721 --> 02:16:48,760
imagine you would suck.
I'm terrible.

2926
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:49,773
Are you?
No.

2927
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:50,770
Okay.
Yeah,

2928
02:16:50,770 --> 02:16:53,070
I didn't think you would.
And uh,

2929
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:54,580
talking to at the comedy store was very
fun,

2930
02:16:54,581 --> 02:16:58,750
so I'm glad we did this man.
We just did a two and a half hours of a

2931
02:16:58,751 --> 02:17:01,480
breakdown of the criminal justice system
here,

2932
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:05,860
thought and especially the criminal
justice system there and outside of

2933
02:17:05,861 --> 02:17:06,770
Madison,
Wisconsin.

2934
02:17:06,771 --> 02:17:08,400
And so,
um,

2935
02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:09,910
how long have you been doing standup
now?

2936
02:17:10,290 --> 02:17:11,920
Uh,
seven years,

2937
02:17:11,921 --> 02:17:13,750
I think.
Enjoying it.

2938
02:17:13,870 --> 02:17:14,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

2939
02:17:14,770 --> 02:17:16,570
It's Super Fun.
And what brought you to the store?

2940
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:19,970
Uh,
well I was in Wisconsin,

2941
02:17:19,971 --> 02:17:22,310
but I moved here in January of last
year.

2942
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:26,150
And honestly,
I really like pauly shore.

2943
02:17:26,310 --> 02:17:28,690
No,
no.

2944
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:33,700
Like I was a kid in the 80s,
so when I would see Sam kinison on TV

2945
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:39,650
and pauly shore on TV and everybody on
tv like it,

2946
02:17:39,651 --> 02:17:41,870
oh,
it always wound its way back to the

2947
02:17:41,871 --> 02:17:44,270
store.
Like pauly shore's first album is I

2948
02:17:44,271 --> 02:17:46,850
think recorded at the comedy store and
you can hear Ron,

2949
02:17:46,851 --> 02:17:50,150
Jeremy and uh,
Gary Coleman in the background.

2950
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:55,800
Like it's nuts and like
laugh factory doesn't hire comics,

2951
02:17:56,720 --> 02:17:57,950
you know,
an Improv.

2952
02:17:57,951 --> 02:18:02,480
Is it like the store is kind of an icon.
And I worked in comedy clubs before,

2953
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:03,620
so I was like,
hey.

2954
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:09,160
Also the reality of it is like the
potluck is so hard to get on that Monday

2955
02:18:11,091 --> 02:18:15,860
night potluck and I had signed up every
single Monday for six months and I

2956
02:18:15,861 --> 02:18:18,950
hadn't gotten on once.
And then,

2957
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:20,233
uh,
they,

2958
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:24,350
they put out a list saying they're going
to do auditions for the new door guys.

2959
02:18:24,740 --> 02:18:29,180
So I signed up for it so that I could
get on the potluck.

2960
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:32,850
But then it just went really well.
Wow.

2961
02:18:34,230 --> 02:18:36,510
Cause I just six months raise.
Yeah.

2962
02:18:36,610 --> 02:18:40,600
I just wanted to get up on the potluck
and signing up for the audition for the

2963
02:18:40,601 --> 02:18:42,040
job was the only way to do it.

2964
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:44,840
Yeah.
You definitely seem overqualified to be

2965
02:18:44,841 --> 02:18:46,820
a door guy.
Yeah.

2966
02:18:46,970 --> 02:18:48,950
I liked the door guys.
It's a great gig.

2967
02:18:49,010 --> 02:18:50,600
Yeah.
But I'm saying you're,

2968
02:18:50,601 --> 02:18:52,490
how old are you?
36 yeah.

2969
02:18:52,491 --> 02:18:54,800
See Most door guys look 2122

2970
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:56,900
they're getting older now.
Yup.

2971
02:18:57,030 --> 02:18:59,600
Guam is in his forties.
Uh,

2972
02:18:59,670 --> 02:19:04,670
hormones is 56 by the look of him.
He fucking loves 56.

2973
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:08,630
It is a special place though,
isn't it?

2974
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:10,660
I mean,
and you are a,

2975
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:12,770
you've been an employee there during the
golden age.

2976
02:19:12,771 --> 02:19:16,400
I think there's the golden age.
Like the other night it was Joey Diaz,

2977
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:18,640
Bill Burr,
Dama rare,

2978
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:23,240
crystally Leah,
me and someone else on the show.

2979
02:19:23,241 --> 02:19:24,080
Someone else.
Oh,

2980
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:26,270
Ali Wong.
She was on another one.

2981
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:27,860
Those are different show.
It was just,

2982
02:19:27,890 --> 02:19:28,040
it

2983
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,940
was insanity.
Yeah.

2984
02:19:29,090 --> 02:19:31,130
I was like sitting back watching all
these people and I was like,

2985
02:19:31,131 --> 02:19:33,040
this is the crazy,
I've never seen a lineup help.

2986
02:19:33,130 --> 02:19:34,160
Ron White was the other one.
Yeah.

2987
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:35,720
I'm like,
I've never seen a lineup like this.

2988
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:37,100
This isn't,
this lineup is,

2989
02:19:37,470 --> 02:19:38,480
it's insane.
Yeah.

2990
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:41,150
Just murderer's row.
Oh,

2991
02:19:41,420 --> 02:19:42,800
well,
Joey Dee,

2992
02:19:42,801 --> 02:19:44,450
I don't want to say what the bid is
about,

2993
02:19:44,451 --> 02:19:45,890
but he's got this new bits he's doing
now.

2994
02:19:46,530 --> 02:19:50,750
It's is it?
It's just like it all the years that

2995
02:19:50,751 --> 02:19:52,940
I've been seen standup comedy and doing
it,

2996
02:19:52,970 --> 02:19:57,140
I just never have seen a club like this
or it's on fire right now.

2997
02:19:57,410 --> 02:20:00,140
Every night is sold out.
Crowds are insane.

2998
02:20:00,141 --> 02:20:01,700
Yeah.
It's really weird,

2999
02:20:01,701 --> 02:20:02,830
man.
It's a really weird,

3000
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:04,670
here's another one.
This is from Thursday.

3001
02:20:04,671 --> 02:20:05,504
Yeah.
Okay.

3002
02:20:05,510 --> 02:20:07,040
Bobby Lee.
Tom Papa,

3003
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:09,150
Bobby Lee,
Eliza crystally,

3004
02:20:09,610 --> 02:20:10,940
me,
Jessel neck,

3005
02:20:10,941 --> 02:20:12,670
Ron White,
Andrew Santinello,

3006
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:14,600
Joey Diaz,
Donnelle Rawlings,

3007
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:16,880
Jesus Christ,
and on and on and on.

3008
02:20:17,810 --> 02:20:20,240
Fuck man.
Jimmy Schubert's going to go.

3009
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:22,120
What didn't you see me?
Nick Youssef is going to go,

3010
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,660
what do you see me,
Dave Taylor.

3011
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:24,970
I know.
Skakel me.

3012
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:29,270
I could really read the whole list,
but it's an amazing lineup of known and

3013
02:20:29,271 --> 02:20:30,104
unknown.
Yeah.

3014
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:34,850
I mean the guy in the second to last
spot created one of the shows on NBC

3015
02:20:34,851 --> 02:20:37,940
that's gone into its third season and
the guy who's going dead last to had a

3016
02:20:37,941 --> 02:20:41,290
movie on comedy central.
Like it's,

3017
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:42,740
yeah,
that's tom embarrassed though.

3018
02:20:42,741 --> 02:20:46,340
He's an icon Stephan situation.
Like he belongs in that late,

3019
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:47,660
late spot.
What I'm saying,

3020
02:20:47,661 --> 02:20:50,030
it's like that's how fucking pack the
lineup is insane.

3021
02:20:50,270 --> 02:20:51,500
Yeah.
But it's not just that,

3022
02:20:51,501 --> 02:20:56,330
it's also the vibe because of the fact
that the store hires all comedians like

3023
02:20:56,331 --> 02:20:58,670
yourself and like all these other ones
that work there.

3024
02:20:58,671 --> 02:21:00,650
It's like everybody is one of us.

3025
02:21:00,820 --> 02:21:04,310
You know,
and many guys have gone from being in

3026
02:21:04,311 --> 02:21:08,270
the position of being a doorman or work
in the cover booth or what have you to

3027
02:21:08,271 --> 02:21:12,470
being like Ari Shaffir perfect example.
Duncan trussell perfect example.

3028
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:16,160
You know that have gone on during the
time that I've known him went from

3029
02:21:16,161 --> 02:21:19,040
starting out to being like super
headliners on the road.

3030
02:21:19,041 --> 02:21:20,450
Like yeah,
it's fascinating.

3031
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:25,780
So there's no clubs like that where the
employees become the star attraction.

3032
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:26,893
Yeah,
yeah.

3033
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:28,161
It's,
yeah.

3034
02:21:28,161 --> 02:21:30,590
It's the only one.
It's the only club that has like a true

3035
02:21:30,591 --> 02:21:31,850
farm system.
Right?

3036
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:33,890
Yeah.
Especially in the fact that that farm

3037
02:21:33,891 --> 02:21:36,710
system exists in Hollywood.
And granted it's not,

3038
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:40,830
it's not that easy to get into is you
can attest and it took six months of

3039
02:21:40,850 --> 02:21:45,170
nose to fucking the lineup is just,
there's just too many people that want

3040
02:21:45,171 --> 02:21:46,970
to become comics now,
isn't it?

3041
02:21:46,971 --> 02:21:48,380
Was not like that before,
by the way.

3042
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:51,200
No,
I know when to get up every week before

3043
02:21:51,890 --> 02:21:56,240
those to it.
When I started in Madison in 2000

3044
02:21:56,570 --> 02:22:01,070
whenever there was like eight people,
eight comics,

3045
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:06,520
and then when I left,
there's 60 then that would sign up for

3046
02:22:07,371 --> 02:22:10,040
the funniest comedian and Madison every
single year.

3047
02:22:10,490 --> 02:22:11,930
Whoa.
So yeah,

3048
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:16,340
it's booming and I mean,
but under noon it's booming and quality

3049
02:22:16,341 --> 02:22:20,260
as well because there's an aspect of
storm and drawing.

3050
02:22:20,261 --> 02:22:23,720
Like there's only so many spots.
So these people have to be better.

3051
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:25,770
Like these 60,

3052
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:31,220
like you start now,
you got to know how you are the best and

3053
02:22:31,860 --> 02:22:36,210
why not try to be the best.
Why not try to fucking smoke that shit.

3054
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:40,560
Like crush it for three minutes.
Like why half acid?

3055
02:22:40,750 --> 02:22:43,620
Like it used to be able to,
well,

3056
02:22:43,950 --> 02:22:47,370
even if they didn't want to have facet,
it's like,

3057
02:22:48,270 --> 02:22:51,390
it's not that they were half ass it and
it's like their standards got raised.

3058
02:22:51,710 --> 02:22:53,970
Like you see like roast battles,
perfect example of that.

3059
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:56,610
I mean how many people courage at
Rosebank.

3060
02:22:56,611 --> 02:22:59,220
Oh yeah.
That you've never heard of it before and

3061
02:22:59,221 --> 02:23:01,920
you know,
they're writing ridiculously funny jokes

3062
02:23:01,921 --> 02:23:03,350
and crushing each other.
Yeah.

3063
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:05,760
And they're coming up and they're
hungry.

3064
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:07,470
There's a lot of them.
Competition.

3065
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:09,510
Yeah.
It's a fun time,

3066
02:23:09,511 --> 02:23:10,344
man.
Yeah,

3067
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:11,970
it's a really fun time.
So,

3068
02:23:11,971 --> 02:23:12,960
uh,

3069
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:15,200
