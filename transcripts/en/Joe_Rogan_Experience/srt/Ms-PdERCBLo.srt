1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:01,891
you know,

3
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:03,570
and I think first of all,

4
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,000
those style of comedy that
you and I come from too,

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,930
you get very spoiled at it for a
certain particular type of colleague.

6
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,200
Boston comedy is a very
specific kind of comedy.

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,440
If you stop and think about how many
good comics have come from Boston,

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,340
you know,

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,900
Jay Leno came from Boston.

10
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:22,050
Steven Wright came from Boston guys
that people don't know that it probably

11
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:25,140
better than 90% of the fucking
people that are like big name comics.

12
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:25,974
Like Gavin,

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,940
Don Gavin,

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,670
one of the funniest guys ever
walked the face of the earth.

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,420
He's,

16
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,740
he's a monster.

17
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,070
He's a masterful king like the east coast,

18
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,870
I think all the way down to like DC,

19
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,580
the amount of guys.

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,830
But I think that Boston was a rare place
because we're from Boston does have a

21
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:44,970
lot of it in and leave.

22
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,960
They didn't leave.

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,400
Those guys stayed there.

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,810
No one left Boston,

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,980
the big monsters.

26
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,090
Steve Sweeney,

27
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,171
Kenny Rogers,

28
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,090
Sin Those Don Gavin,

29
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,220
Mike Donovan when I was a kid.

30
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:56,581
Okay.

31
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:57,340
And I and I,

32
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,210
when I first started doing open mics
there and those guys were all the national

33
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:02,070
headliners or the the
local headliners rather,

34
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:03,440
they'd be at Nick's and they'd be it.

35
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,560
You have the connection.

36
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,250
I remember sitting there watching those
guys and they would kind of like some

37
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,790
like national guy would come through like
Billy crystal and Billy crystal would

38
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,820
come through and they
would put on dawn Gavin,

39
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,010
Steve Sweeney and fucking and Lenny
Clarke in a row and then bring up Billy

40
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,640
crystal and it wasn't fair.

41
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,800
They did it on purpose.

42
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,310
They knew that the level of comedy was
so high there and these guys were only

43
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:30,260
doing 20 minutes tight
to say 20 minutes doing.

44
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
A lot of them were doing local references.

45
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:32,940
Dude,

46
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,390
I don't give up.

47
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,380
If you put on for local
headliners in front of me,

48
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,590
if I'm on the road,

49
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:38,761
yeah,

50
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:39,450
I'm fucked.

51
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,170
You're fucked.

52
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,720
You're fucked for the first couple of
minutes until you can get them into your

53
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,230
groove.

54
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,360
But people love local Shit and Boston,

55
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,220
especially Boston is such a,

56
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,860
a city that in love
with being from Boston,

57
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,190
so it's done of them was one of my faith
and his name doesn't get brought up but

58
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:56,640
not enough topic that he
used to do that joke about.

59
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:57,330
Uh,

60
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,163
had some,

61
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,501
he,

62
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:02,100
his comedy was so blue
collar and I was coming up,

63
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,910
uh,

64
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,181
you know,

65
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,680
working at warehouses and stuff.

66
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:05,161
It was where my,

67
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:06,510
both my parents were professional,

68
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,021
white collar,

69
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:08,250
but I was a moron,

70
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,620
so fucked up in school.

71
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:11,930
So I had like blue collar jobs.

72
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,570
So his comedy was just
right out over the place.

73
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,563
He did something,

74
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,500
he had some sort of back and forth with
the boss and he made this reference,

75
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:19,890
you know,

76
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,620
basically tell him the
boss to go fuck himself.

77
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:22,981
He said,

78
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,060
I'll take a 20 minutes,

79
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,620
shit on the clock if I want to.

80
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,180
And I fucking fell out because there
was always that lazy fuck wouldn't help

81
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,140
unload the trucks.

82
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,530
He had every God damn trick in the Book
and how to somehow make that eight hour

83
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,191
day go by.

84
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:39,600
And one of them was when he grabbed the
Herald and the globe to go take a shit

85
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:44,040
and it would somehow take like
fucking 40 minutes every day.

86
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,250
Donovan was a,

87
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:45,991
he's another one.

88
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:46,824
He's a master.

89
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,380
There was a bunch of guys
that were around back then.

90
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,161
I mean there's still around.

91
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:51,100
I'm sure Donald when you,

92
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:54,230
if you live in Boston you could probably
find them headline and somewhere and

93
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,051
he's still doing comedy,

94
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm sure.

95
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,860
Right?

96
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,330
I know he ran a foul into
the IRS for a bit o the,

97
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,290
a lot of those guys that were working
for cash for a long time and they weren't

98
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,120
paying tax.

99
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,200
I didn't hear anything about that.

100
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,880
I heard they will all up to date.

101
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,730
I don't know.

102
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,563
I'm talking about,

103
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:07,981
yeah,

104
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:08,371
you're right.

105
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:08,731
You know what?

106
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:09,540
I miss her.

107
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,790
I miss heard those,

108
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,150
those guys out in Long Island.

109
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,961
I makes some of them.

110
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,610
Did I miss her?

111
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:15,931
Oh,

112
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:16,591
here's another one.

113
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,060
It doesn't get brought up teddy burrs.

114
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:18,610
Ron,

115
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,040
do you ever get a chance to teddy bears?

116
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Holy Shit.

117
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:22,260
That guy was good.

118
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,213
Let me tell you something.

119
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,390
I saw that guy in 1988 I was at an open
mic night and it was one of the first

120
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:29,040
times that I've thought
about quitting comedy.

121
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,710
He went to,

122
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,320
yeah,

123
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,420
it was an open mic night
and I went up and I,

124
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:33,751
you know,

125
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:36,360
I did my little five
minutes of fucking nonsense,

126
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,021
stupid,

127
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:37,650
terrible,

128
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,490
bad comedy.

129
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,900
Just trying to make people laugh,

130
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:42,540
didn't know what the fuck I was
doing and didn't go so good.

131
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,010
You know those early sets.

132
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,060
It was like one of my
third or fourth sets,

133
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:46,800
some not so good,

134
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,633
clumsy,

135
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,061
you know,

136
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,470
maybe one laugh and then I fuck it up
with a swag punchline and I just didn't

137
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:53,304
know it as known.

138
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,040
Teddy bears run.

139
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,360
It goes up and just so fucking smooth,

140
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,600
smooth and relaxed and the way he
would talk just like mesmerizing.

141
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,250
And I had heard about his tonight show,

142
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:09,850
fucking said he had just done the tonight
show and somebody had a video of it

143
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,490
and they played the video and
he plays the fucking piano.

144
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:13,270
He does like this,

145
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,920
talks about commercials and he
plays the piano and talks about it.

146
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,130
It's so fucking smooth and so good.

147
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,360
You would look at them and go,

148
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:19,511
okay,

149
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:20,830
this guy's going to be gigantic.

150
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:22,090
This guy's going to be bigger than,

151
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,290
than Robin Williams.

152
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,030
He's going to be the biggest
stand up comic of the country.

153
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,680
Never left Boston.

154
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,293
Just stayed.

155
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,060
Yeah,

156
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,770
they are staying.

157
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,100
I don't,

158
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,410
yeah,

159
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:30,800
they will.

160
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,490
They would.

161
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,560
It was like were like townies,

162
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:34,460
but uh,

163
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,051
but comedians,

164
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,280
but that guy got work,

165
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,630
the all got work in Boston.

166
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:39,620
They didn't have to leave.

167
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:42,310
See when they were working at Nick's
comedy stop and they were working at,

168
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,790
you know,

169
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,090
stitches and all these different clubs,

170
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,830
they can hop around from club to club.

171
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:46,790
Like there's a that,

172
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,730
that um,

173
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,340
you've said that documentary and France,

174
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:50,160
Alameda did.

175
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,993
Standup stood out.

176
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,261
Yeah.

177
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:51,391
And,

178
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:51,801
and you know,

179
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,900
Lindy Clark talks about all
the different sets that he did.

180
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,350
He would do all these different sets of
night and we'd go from here to there.

181
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,680
They are there and
they're there in clothes.

182
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,480
They'd be making 1500 bucks a night.

183
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,721
Yeah.

184
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:03,890
And he's just hire a driver just to
wait outside and do all this sets.

185
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:07,310
What I loved about those guys is there
was almost like a height requirement to

186
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,050
like they will all like fucking six,

187
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:09,411
two,

188
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:09,891
six,

189
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:14,891
three huge guys and they
could like literally would
have like a keg of beer over

190
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:19,100
one shoulder and like an eight ball in
their hand and we'd just be going from

191
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:19,851
Club to club,

192
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:24,500
destroys drawing and demurred and do it
below all the way just to keep that buzz

193
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:25,370
going and then,

194
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:26,720
and then at the end of the night,

195
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,320
dude,

196
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
I heard some fuck that.

197
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,780
That back at Nick's man.

198
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,170
Somebody.

199
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,680
Yeah they offered to pay me in coke.

200
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,480
Yeah

201
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,650
they would offer to pay you in coke.

202
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,820
Yeah that was the deal.

203
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,050
Did they give you do coke?

204
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,970
Oh no we can pay in coke.

205
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,980
No I'll take care.

206
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,590
Yeah,

207
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,980
take fuck.

208
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,580
Like I thought that was a joke.

209
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,170
I didn't realize they pay you in coke.

210
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,710
They will be offered to pay you and coke
and they do a lot of guys did a lot of

211
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:50,130
guys some

212
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,030
of their money in coke cause I guess
are comedians and porn stars to two

213
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,571
careers.

214
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:57,500
I couldn't get paid and coke
if it had to come to it.

215
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:57,770
Yeah,

216
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,010
I would

217
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,540
say probably bands too.

218
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,740
Bands,

219
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,170
a portion of the boxers back in the Dj's,

220
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,620
they give you some
chips you have see that.

221
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,940
I know it was just a photo op thing.

222
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,581
We ever see that,

223
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:09,430
that great picture of
Sonny Liston where he's a,

224
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,980
it looks like he just knocked somebody
out and he's sitting there still in his

225
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:12,880
box of trunks.

226
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,110
Hands taped up.

227
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,990
I think his hands on.

228
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,810
But I that had to been a promotional.

229
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,540
Even even those mob guys would be like,

230
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,383
come on Sunday.

231
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,030
Don't you think the starting on Boston
was like one of the best places you could

232
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:29,110
have ever chose to begin
your comedy career?

233
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,790
I think about that a lot.

234
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,460
So Lanette,

235
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,370
whenever I think about that
cause when did you start?

236
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:33,790
What year?

237
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,070
I started in March of 92.

238
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,810
Uh,

239
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:38,501
it was like 23,

240
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,191
almost 24,

241
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:43,390
so I started a little bit late and
I remember just some of the times,

242
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:46,270
like when I've gone on the road and a,

243
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,130
and you meet the young
up and coming guys like,

244
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:48,281
yeah,

245
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,650
the comedy scene here sucks and Blah,

246
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:51,520
blah blah blah blah.

247
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,353
Like they,

248
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,530
it sucks so bad.

249
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:54,820
Like don't even know what to do.

250
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,931
And you always tell them,

251
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:57,340
we'll just go out and start a room.

252
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,481
Like some of them,

253
00:06:58,481 --> 00:06:58,840
like,

254
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,950
you know the scene so bad,

255
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,060
they don't even think of doing that.

256
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:01,950
It's like what even start roaming,

257
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,880
say go pick a fucking sports bar
that does no business on a Monday,

258
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
Tuesday and tell them that you're
going to get people in here,

259
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:09,551
you know,

260
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:10,640
lie to them that they,

261
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,050
you know,

262
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,930
you're going to get people to come in
to watch these fucking open miker is do

263
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:15,690
five minutes each day.

264
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,310
The first time I ate my
fucking balls on stage,

265
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:23,050
I was doing this place like Kelly's
something or other in either reading or

266
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:23,861
north Redding.

267
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:24,960
It doesn't exist anymore.

268
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,511
This comedian,

269
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:29,980
Jack Lynch booked it and there would
literally be like a Bruins game on TV

270
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,640
and they wouldn't shut the game off.

271
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,480
Fuck no,

272
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:32,661
no.

273
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,240
You got to do comedy over the game and
the volume for the game was still on too.

274
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:36,800
Yeah.

275
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,090
A lot of those gigs down the Cape.

276
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,520
I did a lot of those gigs and you'd
find out the fucking game was on.

277
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,660
Why you got to like fuck the game.

278
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,650
Are they going to leave the game on?

279
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,760
There was like an always an issue.

280
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,130
You're going to leave the game and said
[inaudible] we're going to turn the game

281
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:46,460
off.

282
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,690
They would turn the game
I've ever been to go,

283
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:50,410
what the fuck I fucking shot.

284
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:51,590
Nick came off,

285
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,770
he shot in the foot and then you would
have to go do comedy for a bunch of

286
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:56,890
people were angry at you
for shutting the game.

287
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,380
Oh,

288
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,190
it was brutal.

289
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,430
And I remember the second
question other than,

290
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,110
uh,

291
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,580
are you going to,

292
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:02,990
uh,

293
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,220
are you going to shut the game off?

294
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:04,351
Is,

295
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,501
is,

296
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,860
is there a stage that was another thing.

297
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,360
So you just stand,

298
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,880
you just stammered over that dude.

299
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,970
I remember doing a Gig,

300
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,290
this is how green we are,

301
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,130
where it was me,

302
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,130
uh,

303
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,721
Al del,

304
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,440
Benny,

305
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,790
Patrice O'Neil,

306
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,470
and I want to say Dane Cook was
on it and we were so Bobby Kelly,

307
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,090
I think it was his gig that he booked.

308
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,660
We were so green and years
later I finally figured it out.

309
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,670
They gave us this microphone.

310
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,900
It was a lapel mic.

311
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,621
Oh my God.

312
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:35,150
We had to go up and do comedy with
just like a lapel on like we were doing

313
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:35,810
Letterman,

314
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,310
but we were so green.

315
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,050
We didn't know that you
clipped it on cereal.

316
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,490
All standing there holding,

317
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,810
I swear to God,

318
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,340
holding a lapel mic.

319
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,720
I remember portrays he's like fucking six
five hold it because I remember that's

320
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:47,901
right.

321
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:50,810
Dell Benny Ldl Benny was hosting is like,

322
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:52,410
what the fuck is up with this Mike?

323
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,150
He's like,

324
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,380
this is the smallest Mike ever.

325
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:54,591
I'll look,

326
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:55,060
I'll put it in.

327
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,870
Aunt had it in his mouth and
we're all laughing at them like,

328
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,081
yeah,

329
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,400
what a half fast fucking Gig.

330
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:02,640
And we were so stupid that we didn't
understand what it was and like he would

331
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,000
let it,

332
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,540
Al would bring me up and then hand me
the mic like a tea cup with his pinkies

333
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,760
out picky out and I would just be like,

334
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:09,121
hey,

335
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,720
keep it going.

336
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,460
[inaudible] and my dad was,

337
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,910
he was pretty nuts growing up with like
three fingers up in the air holding this

338
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:15,170
thing

339
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,290
and I went from that to two
from from going to taekwondo,

340
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,490
straight into going to comedy,

341
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:20,871
kickboxing.

342
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:23,750
I had a few key three kickboxing fights
and then I went right into comedy

343
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:25,130
because I knew I was going nowhere

344
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,400
so there's no money in it.

345
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,140
What's your opening like standup?

346
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:29,870
Was it about like no knighting?

347
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:30,180
Yeah.

348
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,280
No,

349
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,910
I never talked to him.

350
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,050
Really intense was like,

351
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,680
hello,

352
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,580
this is my comedy.

353
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,110
No,

354
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,030
I tried to do it.

355
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:37,300
You got to talk about your life.

356
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,870
We never talked about that.

357
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,120
There's no one wants to take some
fucking guys on martial arts champion.

358
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,890
That's the thing because he was actually
good at it like this that you've got to

359
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:47,360
be of like low self esteem.

360
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,721
You could say,

361
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,081
you know,

362
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:49,621
if you can say,

363
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:50,100
ah,

364
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,640
I find a taekwondo tournament once and
I fought on Friday and when I finally

365
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,810
woke up on Tuesday,

366
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,380
you know,

367
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,213
after something.

368
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,621
Yeah.

369
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:57,830
So now I'm doing comedy.

370
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:58,590
I think we would like,

371
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:58,990
you can't

372
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,590
say that.

373
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,861
Oh,

374
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:00,520
so I was,

375
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,800
I fucking kicked this dude in the
head and knocked him into a coma.

376
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:03,550
That's not funny,

377
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:03,681
Dude.

378
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:04,330
What am I,

379
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:04,660
when I,

380
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,680
when I started out though,

381
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:06,430
there was like,

382
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:06,671
you know,

383
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:07,480
because all those,

384
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,010
all those headliners didn't leave.

385
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,200
We were like kind of fucked
the end up headlining.

386
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:16,201
We were looking at the only guys who
kind of busted through was you and a

387
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Anthony Clark with the two guys at the
time who would actually somehow gotten

388
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,470
past the old boy network.

389
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,030
Yeah.

390
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,170
Well they left WWE,

391
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,501
you know,

392
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,360
Anthony was one of the,

393
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:27,510
and Nick Depaula left too.

394
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,501
They just left.

395
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:28,711
You know,

396
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,461
you had to leave.

397
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,560
You can't stay in Boston.

398
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,060
It was so intoxicating
because you can make a living.

399
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,700
You could be in Boston and
unit if you were a nobody,

400
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,151
you know,

401
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:36,721
you're still,

402
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,610
you could grind out 500 bucks a week,

403
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:39,570
you know you'd do here,

404
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:39,960
do here.

405
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,760
It was as long as you're
willing to drive and travel.

406
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,260
If you had $500 cash a week,

407
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:44,160
you could pay for your bills.

408
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:44,790
You could eat.

409
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,350
But if you want to try to go on the road,

410
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:46,980
man,

411
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,740
good fucking luck.

412
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,060
Yeah.

413
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,050
No TV credits,

414
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:49,741
no nothing.

415
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:50,880
Just some guy from Boston.

416
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:51,810
How much are they going to pay you?

417
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,130
But you're fucking gas.

418
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,930
Your air fare is going to
eat up all your profits.

419
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:55,764
It's fucking hard.

420
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:56,911
What are you,

421
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:57,390
uh,

422
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,320
what do you think now?

423
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,640
Cause I just went back to Boston.

424
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:00,480
Have you been back there later?

425
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:00,921
Yeah.

426
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:01,201
Yeah.

427
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:01,890
It's sad.

428
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,090
It's nothing going on there now.

429
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,601
What?

430
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:04,231
He's the fucking,

431
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,100
the comedy connections.

432
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:05,940
A theater now,

433
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,331
you know,

434
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,740
it's that big Wilbur theater,

435
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,580
right?

436
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,470
Comedy can actually use to be 150 seats.

437
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,720
That ban has a little room and now it's,

438
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:13,070
you know,

439
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,220
no,

440
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,541
but they,

441
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,260
they reopened that right up the street.

442
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,120
The old Charles Street playhouse.

443
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,420
Yeah.

444
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,253
What's it now?

445
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,880
What's another comedy song called?

446
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,100
I can't remember this one.

447
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:23,240
Small one in Faneuil hall called Motley's.

448
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,010
I did that and that Tim Mackenzie's place,

449
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,270
I can't remember.

450
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:26,630
I did it.

451
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,830
I ran through all of them.

452
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:28,700
There was 80 it was like,

453
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:30,290
and that was like an 85 seater.

454
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,280
I did Dick Dorothy's comedy fault,

455
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,920
but I put together my basically polished
up my first five minutes of material

456
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:37,161
ever.

457
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:38,600
So I always go down there.

458
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,350
The vault,

459
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,920
I did them all.

460
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,281
Oh yeah,

461
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:40,491
dude,

462
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,730
I fucking loved that place and this
is a thing hasn't changed at all.

463
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,650
Like I remember when that place started
is a fucking old I am now and now it's,

464
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,830
they just like celebrate,

465
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,440
aren't they?

466
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,320
I see Tim Mckenzie,

467
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:52,280
I'm sorry if he's listening.

468
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,143
Tim Mcintyre,

469
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,010
I think it started

470
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,750
in 93 yeah.

471
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:56,803
Why was it?

472
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,011
Yeah,

473
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,510
I was a year earlier than that,

474
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,340
son.

475
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,591
No,

476
00:11:59,591 --> 00:11:59,711
no,

477
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,190
no.

478
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,740
The Vault,

479
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,301
Dick tardies.

480
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,134
Comedy Vault.

481
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,570
That shit was around in the 80s all right.

482
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:08,740
Because in 88 when I was around the Dick
doughty commie vault was around Dick

483
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:08,981
Towards town.

484
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:09,970
REMINGTON's yeah.

485
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:10,900
That fucking bank.

486
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,763
It's like a bank.

487
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,963
Wow.

488
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,521
I saw it.

489
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:16,840
I thought Spike Tobin was the
first guy who opened that shit up.

490
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,000
It might have reopened it.

491
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,200
Mighta reopened it.

492
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:19,411
Okay.

493
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:20,370
That's what might've went under.

494
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:21,151
And they brought it back.

495
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:24,810
But Dick is comedy vault was a staple
back when I was living there and I moved

496
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,220
out of Boston like 92.

497
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:26,791
Yeah,

498
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,960
you were gone before I wrote.

499
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:28,681
When I started.

500
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,610
You were already gone.

501
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,133
Um,

502
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,610
yeah.

503
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,900
What the fuck was I working at?

504
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,160
I think I was,

505
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,761
first time I saw,

506
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:36,271
I saw you what?

507
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:37,104
The cow alone.

508
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,821
Oh,

509
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:38,460
that place.

510
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,480
That was a good place.

511
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,260
Yeah.

512
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,150
Always food is Chinese food and comedy
still Chinese food and comedy's a weird

513
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:46,680
combination of exist in Boston.

514
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:47,514
Like the biggest,

515
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,960
the most famous historical Comedy Club
in Boston was the Ding Ho so Chinese

516
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:53,370
restaurant that they had comedy out of.

517
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:55,470
And now the only place that
exists that place had a,

518
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:55,921
uh,

519
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:56,940
Rick Jenkins runs.

520
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,320
He runs a place in Cambridge.

521
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,591
Yeah.

522
00:12:58,591 --> 00:12:59,221
And that's the,

523
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:00,054
uh,

524
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,260
that's another Chinese restaurant,

525
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,771
restaurant,

526
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:04,860
his restaurant and upstairs
you can comedy labs.

527
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,580
I what they call it.

528
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:05,870
Yeah,

529
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,621
I remember the,

530
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:06,720
uh,

531
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,260
the act,

532
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,850
the cool,

533
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,370
cool,

534
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,651
cool,

535
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:09,390
cool.

536
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,390
And then the other places might,

537
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:12,120
Clark's plays giggles and Saugus.

538
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:12,630
Yeah.

539
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,230
You know,

540
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,660
but there's more work in Boston or the,

541
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,090
at least there was like
just little road gigs,

542
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,290
an hour drive here,

543
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,130
hour drive there,

544
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,580
more of those in that area than
anywhere else in the country.

545
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:26,640
Know what I would talk to guys from
like other places and then I'm like,

546
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:27,421
where's your road gigs?

547
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:28,440
Or where do you go for road gigs?

548
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:28,891
Oh,

549
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,131
you know,

550
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:30,690
sometimes I do Ohio sometimes.

551
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,271
Like what do you got?

552
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:31,501
No,

553
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:32,550
don't you have gigs around here?

554
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,410
Like no one could make
a living around there.

555
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:34,861
Yeah.

556
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:36,240
But Lord or something,

557
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,840
nobody,

558
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,040
nobody would start like,

559
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:38,551
I don't know what it is.

560
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:38,941
I bought,

561
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:39,990
people would just start rooms,

562
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,970
don't have a Bob Marley out of Maine.

563
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,330
He came down like a fully formed fucking
headliner just because he had like 25

564
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:48,720
rooms going up in Maine.

565
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:51,240
Like he started basically
it was like Mcdonald's,

566
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,680
but he started with like comrades.

567
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,820
He used to tell me when he was living
up there and it was getting so big,

568
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:59,640
he actually ended up leaving
because he almost became,

569
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:02,040
I think like a kind of almost
like a club owner at that point.

570
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:02,641
He could have done it.

571
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,110
But um,

572
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,250
he basically started the
comedy scene up there.

573
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:10,110
Cause before that all they
had was like the connection.

574
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:11,310
But like Portland.

575
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:11,940
Yeah.

576
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,301
Yeah.

577
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:12,531
And he,

578
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:14,880
he started like he had at any time

579
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,820
I used to do gigs in Bangor
and Bob would do like,

580
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,740
guess bots and shit when
he was first starting out.

581
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,521
Bobby,

582
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:22,350
I don't know if you know
how famous he is in Maine,

583
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,780
do you know?

584
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:22,951
Yeah,

585
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:23,161
no,

586
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:23,520
no.

587
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:23,731
Yeah.

588
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:24,331
He's like,

589
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,550
if you don't know who Bob
Marley is a very funny guy,

590
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:27,121
very nice guy.

591
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:28,860
I've known him for fucking 20 plus years.

592
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,360
Always been just a great guy.

593
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,130
But when he first started out,

594
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:32,790
you know,

595
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,623
there was like,

596
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,530
this is like,

597
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:34,800
you know,

598
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,810
probably he probably started in 89 or 90.

599
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:38,910
There's no one known
from being from Maine.

600
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,920
There's no like one main
comic that stands up,

601
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,570
but Bob Marley in anywhere
else in the country is like,

602
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,630
people might have heard of them.

603
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,930
You might have heard him on Xm radio,

604
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:48,300
you might have seen him on comedy
central or something in Maine.

605
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,250
That motherfucker is huge.

606
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,580
If there's no comparison,

607
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,610
it's like Blasius or Gabriel
Iglesias and in La is giant.

608
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,260
Gabriel Iglesias does shows in La.

609
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:02,780
Well he'll do like five
shows on a Monday night,

610
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,380
like something fucking nutty and sell
out everyone like days and days in

611
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:07,214
advance.

612
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,600
That's how he is.

613
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,463
Nobody else was like,

614
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:09,781
yeah,

615
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:09,960
no.

616
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,621
He used to go,

617
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:14,640
I remember he was telling me he would
basically be in La auditioning and then

618
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:15,051
every year,

619
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:15,241
right,

620
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:16,740
it's the holidays came around.

621
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:22,010
He would make like 10 times what I made
on the road in that month just as she'll

622
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,011
be talking about is money.

623
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:23,371
But yeah,

624
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:27,120
he would just go up there and do parties
and then he do the new year's thing and

625
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,153
there's this one we would like,

626
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,030
he would do like a,

627
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,160
like a 1500 2000 seat or need to be
doing like adding shows and shit.

628
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,760
Yeah.

629
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,350
And doing all this main material,

630
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,010
you know,

631
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,641
so much main.

632
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,870
Like I was listening to them on the
radio the other day was on Xm radio.

633
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,890
I was doing all these main jokes in it.

634
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,890
He was doing them in Maine.

635
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:43,730
They were going crazy.

636
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:44,490
They were fucking

637
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,100
no in the he also dude
he has like a box set.

638
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:49,960
That's how many albums
this dude is put out.

639
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,360
He's put out like 16 albums,

640
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,480
14 album's fucking unbelievable.

641
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,790
The amount of hours,

642
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,880
14 hours of fucking money.

643
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,603
I kind of,

644
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,100
I pretty much have stuck close
with the same guys that I started.

645
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,690
Like my graduating class,

646
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,800
Bobby Kelly,

647
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,430
LDL,

648
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,850
Benny,

649
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,860
you know our new bur when I first started.

650
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:10,730
And Patrice,

651
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:11,650
um,

652
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,290
cause we kind of came up like a little
bit after you like you were a couple of

653
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:15,560
years ahead.

654
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,050
Headlines

655
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,391
early on.

656
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:20,740
I did a bunch of a really a fun
little gigs for dicta already.

657
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,690
The comedy huts.

658
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,630
Remember those comedy Gods in Cambridge?

659
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,070
Did we did Dick towards comedy?

660
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,900
Hung out on the monkeys.

661
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,160
Dane was with a,

662
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:33,070
a comedy troupe with Bob Kelly
and him and Altel Benny was so,

663
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:34,120
it was a good comedy troupe.

664
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:34,954
You guys were funny.

665
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,681
It was good.

666
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:35,981
You know,

667
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:36,740
it was interesting.

668
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,550
You would do comedy sketches
and then you would do,

669
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:40,210
like,

670
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,980
each guy would go up and do stand up,

671
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,400
right?

672
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,570
And so we would work together,

673
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,170
do these uh,

674
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,003
Dick Dardy gaze.

675
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,970
Those were fucking fun.

676
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,350
Our sketch comedy Improv group was,

677
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,460
was so bad.

678
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,770
We were so bad at Improv and everybody,

679
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:51,951
you know,

680
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:54,050
the first rule of Improv is don't deny,

681
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,260
but we were so bad at Improv
that our first roles was denied.

682
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,920
So we were just command and
completely ruined scenes by like,

683
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:04,010
you're pretending pantomiming I'm holding
a baby and just Bobby can be big dude.

684
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:05,150
Why are you holding a tire?

685
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,650
And you just,

686
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,030
it would just fall apart from there.

687
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:08,890
But we just had a boy.

688
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:10,100
You guys have some good ones.

689
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,180
You had some good sketches.

690
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,020
Good.

691
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,650
It was fun.

692
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,540
I mean it was it and it was experimental.

693
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,040
It was like you guys were taking chances.

694
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,260
You were doing something a
little unusual at a comedy club.

695
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,700
Just you were doing comedy too.

696
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,411
Yeah.

697
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:23,200
That was probably actually better for
us opening with our standup and then we

698
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:26,230
just go fuck around and do music
or skits or Improv or whatever for,

699
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:26,531
you know,

700
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:28,030
whatever the rest of
the hour to fill it out.

701
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:28,570
But we,

702
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,500
we also,

703
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:29,771
you know,

704
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:32,170
we came out of Boston where,

705
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:32,830
you know,

706
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,820
I know the guys that I can't,

707
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,540
I mean I loved,

708
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,690
I love Steve Martin and the guys
that I always loved just watching,

709
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,490
growing up that I wanted to emulate.

710
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,080
And then when I started in Boston,

711
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,430
these guys were like,

712
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,600
killers man.

713
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,510
People don't understand about Boston is
everybody knows all these famous guys.

714
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:48,860
Everybody knows Billy crystal.

715
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,703
Everybody knows.

716
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,310
You know,

717
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,581
I mean,

718
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:51,660
and the very good comics,

719
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:52,560
Robert Klein,

720
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,610
but I Blah Blah Blah would name the Guy
Don Gavin was better than all of them.

721
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah.

722
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,110
He was better than all of them.

723
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:58,680
And this is,

724
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,150
this is not an exaggeration,

725
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,100
and he was fucking squeaky clean.

726
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,401
I mean,

727
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:03,121
every now and then he say,

728
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:03,930
fucking fuck.

729
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,030
Fuck a little listen man.

730
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
But his bits,

731
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:07,350
we're not dirty.

732
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,230
It was delivery was perfect.

733
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,790
It was perfect.

734
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,150
Yeah.

735
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,190
You would watch his economy of words,

736
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,880
the way he set a sentence up
and you would just feel humbled.

737
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:18,361
You would be like,

738
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:18,721
fuck,

739
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,554
he's a master.

740
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,730
He's a master.

741
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,410
But he got caught up in this Boston thing
where there's all these great guys in

742
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:28,830
this one area and they always drew a
crowd and they always got paid well.

743
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,420
And then they would go on the
road and they'd be nobody's.

744
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:30,691
They'd be like,

745
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:31,710
why would they be a fucking nobody?

746
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,860
You've got to be back back in Boston.

747
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,410
The next thing you know,

748
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,080
they're back in Boston and they're just
doing the same gigs over and over again.

749
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:40,530
When everybody else takes a shot and
branches off and disappears and becomes

750
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:41,040
famous

751
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,490
and you,

752
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,490
but you really would watch these guys
and part of you would feel bad that they

753
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,050
weren't getting over the hump,

754
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,460
but you felt like so fucking honored
to be opening up and standing,

755
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,241
watching going,

756
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:52,320
I'm learning from the best.

757
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:52,980
Sure.

758
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,300
When you leave Boston,

759
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,420
it's like you had that
these were guys like,

760
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:59,760
I always describe it like they
had the energy of showman,

761
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:01,140
but they were like men.

762
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,910
They were like men doing comedy.

763
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,390
Yes,

764
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:03,990
yes.

765
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,501
And I,

766
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:04,890
you know,

767
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,390
I always really wanted to be there.

768
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,310
They always stood right at the
fucking front of the stage.

769
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,680
They were re Lenny Clarke is
the perfect example of that.

770
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,940
When Lenny's a fucking man,

771
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:13,530
he's the guy.

772
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,970
This is what Larry Clarkson was.

773
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,470
We were at giggles and Sagas and there
was this fucking table full of chicks.

774
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:18,611
They,

775
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:18,950
they wouldn't

776
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,910
shut the fuck up.

777
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,350
They were screaming and yelling.

778
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:21,740
He goes,

779
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,400
listen,

780
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,720
if you don't shut the fuck up,

781
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:24,770
I'm going to hire a Nigga.

782
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:26,030
Fuck you in front of your mother.

783
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,693
Like

784
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,580
what the fuck it he does say mean.

785
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,231
It was me.

786
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:34,580
I take Chris Mcguire was there,

787
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:35,480
I think it was me and Chris.

788
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:35,991
I can't remember,

789
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:36,501
but we were like,

790
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:38,150
what the fuck did he just say?

791
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,040
He doesn't give a fuck.

792
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,080
Lenny Clarke did not give a fuck.

793
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:46,310
He was just his big gigantic
burly guy who would,

794
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:46,791
by the way,

795
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,040
he would beat your ass too.

796
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,461
He would.

797
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:49,191
This is like,

798
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:50,870
if you like talk shit to Lenny car,

799
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,030
he'll probably do a line
and punch in the face.

800
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,210
These were real like real
hardcore blue collar guys,

801
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,240
but real king corollary made us,

802
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:03,740
it made us sharper because you were
held up to a much higher standard.

803
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,940
You had to go on after guys who were
way better than average and you had a,

804
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,410
you had to be sharp all the time.

805
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:09,681
You had a,

806
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:12,680
you had to constantly reassess your
material self up for that kind of thing.

807
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,990
I still look back and remember
the first time you ever bombed?

808
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,130
Yeah,

809
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,510
or yeah,

810
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,343
or a bunch of them.

811
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,800
I just wrote,

812
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,730
it's called New York.

813
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,600
I just,

814
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,210
I just wrote a chapter in this book.

815
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:25,520
I'm writing all on the very
first time I ever bombed,

816
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:26,750
which was horrible,

817
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,720
terrible disaster that I'll never forget
because it was the first time I ever

818
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:30,950
bombed while I was getting paid.

819
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,061
Oh Shit.

820
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:32,900
That's a big difference.

821
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:33,460
Yeah.

822
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,610
Bomb and open mic nights.

823
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,360
Everybody's bombing,

824
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,601
you know,

825
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,330
it's like there's like five people are
going to eat shit on stage and you're

826
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:39,350
only up there for five minutes,

827
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,460
but once you do a paid,

828
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,270
and I was middling.

829
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,081
I shouldn't have been middling.

830
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:43,040
I really didn't have the time.

831
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,290
And the guy who went on
before me fucking crushed.

832
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,140
And uh,

833
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,450
there was this chick that I seen the
last time I was there and she was super

834
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:49,691
hot.

835
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:53,020
I fucked her and she was in the front
row and she brought her friends and her

836
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:55,870
friends look and then we're going to sit
in the front row when I went on stage.

837
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:56,830
So I was panicking.

838
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,311
I was like,

839
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:58,480
they're going to be like
right in front of me.

840
00:20:58,481 --> 00:20:59,890
I was only like a year and a comedy,

841
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,150
a year and a half post.

842
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,880
And this guy went up who was
the MC was way better than me.

843
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,161
He would,

844
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:05,590
he was already better than me.

845
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,280
And I was like,

846
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I conned this fucking book
it to making me a middle.

847
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,671
I was like,

848
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:10,680
it's just a cocky dude.

849
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,931
I was like,

850
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:11,260
I can be,

851
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,741
I can middle,

852
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:11,981
come on,

853
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:12,371
I can middle.

854
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:12,730
Yeah.

855
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,481
So He lets me put it on.

856
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:17,770
This guy goes on stage and a
then and he stopped doing comedy.

857
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:18,401
It's really too bad.

858
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,211
He's a natural,

859
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,710
I don't remember his name unfortunately,

860
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,030
but he fucking killed.

861
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,390
And then I went after him and eight just
drive bricks of shit with no water for

862
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:28,654
20 minutes.

863
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,200
It was the most embarrassing
feeling I'd ever had in my life.

864
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:37,030
I couldn't believe how unbearable loss
and her and her friends were like looking

865
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,170
at each other and their friends would
lean over and say something like,

866
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,700
and then I could hear crickets and I'm
trying to be like extra loud because I'm

867
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,250
trying to like be trying to
bring it back to my side.

868
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,780
So like you like forced the punchlines
and the timing is all office even worse.

869
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,930
And my only experience
with being nervous before,

870
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,270
my only experience with
pressure had been fighting.

871
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,490
So when you know fighting and tournaments,

872
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:00,731
you know,

873
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:01,361
if you're nervous,

874
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,950
you just turn inward and you say,

875
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:03,910
this isn't what I want to do this,

876
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:04,311
I'm going to do this.

877
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:05,680
I'm going to do someone
to fucking explode.

878
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:06,550
I'm just gonna to fucking cool.

879
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,471
Terrified.

880
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:10,300
But you just get psyched up to go,

881
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,260
which is the worst thing you could ever
do on stage to be nervous and aggressive

882
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:17,080
and fucking and all introspective
and turned into yourself.

883
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:18,010
I don't give a fuck
what they take them out.

884
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:21,550
I'm just going to call the
worst mindset ever for comedy.

885
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,240
That's called being Carlos.

886
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:23,560
Mitzi?

887
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,390
Yeah.

888
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,340
I'm going to turn it in.

889
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:26,570
I'm going to explode.

890
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,843
The most fun.

891
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,310
I had a shoe.

892
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,700
Uh,

893
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,050
did you ever do shows without microphones?

894
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,920
Oh yeah.

895
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,630
Yup.

896
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,410
I remember parties ever do
a batch point of on the mic.

897
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,011
I did.

898
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:36,251
Yeah.

899
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:40,540
I used to do like a colleges around Boston
where they'd hire me and I'd be like,

900
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:40,890
well,

901
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,550
I'd be standing on a pool table.

902
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,411
I get one more.

903
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:44,760
I'm standing.

904
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,210
Did one in the cafeteria.

905
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:46,790
Standing

906
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,440
cafeteria chair a table.

907
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,010
Yeah,

908
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,000
Ricky table.

909
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,130
Like I couldn't move that
was there their stage.

910
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,740
I did a place in a in Florida
called the rathskeller.

911
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,850
They hired me to come down and it was
like one of my first road gigs and it was

912
00:22:59,851 --> 00:23:03,550
the thing where it's like there's food
being served during the TVs are on every

913
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,220
like all that shit where
it's like the whole room,

914
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,700
everything is happening and I'm doing
standup and like somebody threw a hot dog

915
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:11,100
at me like five minutes into an hour.

916
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,230
Oh those gigs.

917
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,211
Important man.

918
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:16,690
All those shit gigs at Boston comedy
used to book and all those little weird

919
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,370
fucking places in New Hampshire.

920
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:22,450
You would drive an hour and a half up
to New Hampshire and do some weird bar

921
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:23,890
with a tinny sound system.

922
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,570
Those are so good though.

923
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,680
When you look back at it now,

924
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:30,880
like how important were those like for
developing your ability to like focus on

925
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:33,640
stage and kill and cut the
fat out of your act and

926
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,300
I would hope from own domain once I got
a gig up there and it was the first time

927
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:40,400
that we were a few years and
I drove home and I'm like,

928
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,060
all right,

929
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,600
this,

930
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,470
this matters.

931
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,700
Even though it was horrible,

932
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,061
I was like,

933
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:45,470
this matters it this.

934
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,210
Someday I will look back on tonight.

935
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:50,000
Know that like I learned
fucking something here.

936
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,141
Oh Man.

937
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:51,720
But it was,

938
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,760
you never want to come back.

939
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,151
Yeah.

940
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:54,480
You do those gigs and you just

941
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:54,760
like,

942
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,181
wow.

943
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:55,781
Like this is,

944
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:57,640
this doesn't even feel like show business.

945
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:59,320
It feels like I did a thing with this guy,

946
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:00,460
Scott Papic Curie.

947
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,570
He used to book the Mattapoisett
in this little tiny shithole.

948
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,150
Okay.

949
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,520
But it was a great little room
where I got to see teddy bears.

950
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:06,851
Ron,

951
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:07,600
by the way,

952
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,880
who was a fucking genius,

953
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,430
one of the best comics ever,

954
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,270
one of the best comics ever had one of
the best tonight show sets of all time.

955
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:17,140
Did you ever see his tonight show?

956
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:17,940
Sad.

957
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,720
It's fucking genius.

958
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,130
Click another guy where you like,

959
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:26,040
how could this guy not be in everybody's
mind as one of the greatest comics app?

960
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:26,821
And,

961
00:24:26,821 --> 00:24:27,030
uh,

962
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,381
this guy,

963
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:29,110
Scott Pepper puree booked a Gig for,

964
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:33,790
he and I on block island and block island
was like an island outside of Rhode

965
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:33,791
Island,

966
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:34,624
I think.

967
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,670
And there's nothing there.

968
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,080
It's just drunk,

969
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:39,490
retarded fishermen.

970
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,800
And they are dumb as fuck.

971
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,120
And they're so drunk.

972
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:44,590
They are all of them.

973
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:45,940
There's maybe 20 people in the room.

974
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,320
All of them are so drunk.

975
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,820
They can't even keep their eyes open.

976
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,460
Their mouths are sliding.

977
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,260
I watch go high and we
have to do comedy for that.

978
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,380
And Scott gets up and starts
shitting all over them.

979
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:57,400
And he was not really,

980
00:24:57,401 --> 00:24:57,790
you know,

981
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,220
he hadn't been doing comedy that long
then really probably shouldn't have been

982
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:02,170
on stage in this sort
of a situation anyway.

983
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,770
And I went on after him and they had
already turned their backs to the comedy

984
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:06,011
show.

985
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:06,844
Like half of them,

986
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,080
they're turned it back to just started
a conversation and we had a stay in,

987
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,570
um,

988
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,320
uh,

989
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,820
it wasn't,

990
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,020
it wasn't in a hotel room.

991
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,430
It was in a supply room.

992
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:20,290
They had two cots in the supply room
with no shower and there was a bathroom,

993
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:20,741
you know,

994
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:21,550
we could take like,

995
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:21,960
you know,

996
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,793
a a,

997
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:23,770
yeah,

998
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,900
a horse bath and you know,

999
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,780
we stayed in this little fucking supply
room until we could catch the boat back

1000
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:29,614
the next day.

1001
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,853
Oh Man,

1002
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,090
I did so many of those little more.

1003
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:33,680
I mean,

1004
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,280
colleges where the [inaudible] site,

1005
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,123
I got a Gig.

1006
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,390
I know at the time.

1007
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:38,780
Yeah.

1008
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,620
At the time you're like,

1009
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:39,831
all right,

1010
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,350
I get a Gig.

1011
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,050
I'm making 50 bucks or whatever it was.

1012
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,310
But oh man,

1013
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,870
brutal.

1014
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,321
Bangor,

1015
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:45,591
Maine.

1016
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:46,550
I did a bunch up there.

1017
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,150
Yeah,

1018
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,560
I did a bunch for normal.

1019
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,041
The Foa.

1020
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,410
He had all these gigs in
western Massachusetts.

1021
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,281
We're out there.

1022
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:55,520
We had to drive 40 miles an hour cause
deer would jump in front of your fucking

1023
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:55,840
car.

1024
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,673
We five minutes.

1025
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,430
You gotta to be careful
that you didn't die.

1026
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,880
Like you get to these certain games.

1027
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,360
Look,

1028
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,193
sheer shows,

1029
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,340
especially western mass near Amherst.

1030
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:07,880
I remember there was a lot of two lane
roads where you would see dead deer all

1031
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:08,331
over the place.

1032
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:08,660
Right.

1033
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,980
Fucking wreck cars.

1034
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,830
I nailed one one night digital.

1035
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,100
Yeah.

1036
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,291
Yeah.

1037
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,650
Just as just as ass had just gotten past
me and I did the thing where I gunned

1038
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:15,830
it.

1039
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,470
I'm like,

1040
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,450
I wanted to swerve,

1041
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,880
but the voice was like
gunning and I fucking hit him.

1042
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,360
I watched him spin off into the woods.

1043
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,520
You,

1044
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,490
Greg and I started out probably
within like a week of each other.

1045
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:27,820
Yeah.

1046
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,210
Right.

1047
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,510
Yup.

1048
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,410
Back in Boston,

1049
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,900
the old Boston stitches,

1050
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,290
uh,

1051
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,310
comedy community,

1052
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:33,971
you know,

1053
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:35,260
and a dude,

1054
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:35,471
we,

1055
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:37,630
you and I have gone
through some fucking can.

1056
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,640
We went to some crazy
gigs in the beginning,

1057
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:39,911
man.

1058
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:40,091
We,

1059
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:42,010
we went through together.

1060
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,460
We went through like
the time for standups.

1061
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,040
Yeah.

1062
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,610
Well the,

1063
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,710
the early days,

1064
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,151
yeah.

1065
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:49,590
We went through our personal darkest days,

1066
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,620
but at the lightest time in comedy,

1067
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,060
we thought the way

1068
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,250
I see young comics today
and my heartbreaks,

1069
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,050
because they got to
scrounge up stage time.

1070
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:00,740
You and I,

1071
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,190
you know,

1072
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,530
I would say what less than
a year into doing stand up,

1073
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,700
we were driving out and
making 50 bucks cash five,

1074
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:08,540
six nights a week.

1075
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,191
It was for me,

1076
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:10,750
it was exactly one year.

1077
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:14,810
I first got paid by normal
of foe to open up for um,

1078
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,870
Warren Mcdonald peaking garden.

1079
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,801
I don't know where it was.

1080
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:18,611
It was some bar.

1081
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:20,470
I was on a s like an apple box.

1082
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,380
Like literally like standing
on an apple box doing comedy.

1083
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:25,580
You can't fucking move and uh,

1084
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,300
you know,

1085
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,260
I had a good time and then the next
time I lurked for Lenny Clarke,

1086
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,640
those are two times in a row.

1087
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:31,570
I got super lucky.

1088
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:33,340
Normally foe like caught me here.

1089
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,160
Will you shut up you mother fucker man.

1090
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,660
It was like all of us were like,

1091
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,880
there was this ascension you would go,

1092
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,980
you'd wait in line to get a spot on
comedy health open Mike Night Stitches,

1093
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:45,491
comedy club,

1094
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:46,324
George McDonald,

1095
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,390
welcome to comedy hell
where the jokes always die.

1096
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:50,101
The convenience.

1097
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:50,980
It was this whole thing.

1098
00:27:50,981 --> 00:27:51,340
And,

1099
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,930
and we ran out of booze,

1100
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,000
comedy hell where you can fly,

1101
00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:00,030
fly as high as the light's on Broadway
or crash and burn and the fiery pit known

1102
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:01,420
only as comedy.

1103
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:02,254
Hell.

1104
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,430
And that was step one.

1105
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,040
And then you,

1106
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,960
and then you would get like a guest spot
on a real show and then you would start

1107
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:08,830
to get these like,

1108
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:09,101
you know,

1109
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:14,101
25 to $50 Mc spots where you were driving
the headline or somewhere and you jump

1110
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:19,150
past all that shit because they would
send you out to feature and the headliners

1111
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,850
couldn't follow you because you
were out of your fucking mind.

1112
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,600
I mean,

1113
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,310
you were nuts and uh,

1114
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:25,410
and so they had to headline you.

1115
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,870
So you started working like
the d rooms but headlining,

1116
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:28,961
I'm,

1117
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:32,500
so you started to get an
hour together super fast.

1118
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,251
Yeah,

1119
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:33,900
I had to,

1120
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,020
I had a sink or swim.

1121
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,160
Those times when,

1122
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:36,970
uh,

1123
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,241
Greg,

1124
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:39,940
it would make agreements
to steal each other's shit.

1125
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,183
We were bombing

1126
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,541
say,

1127
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:43,841
dude,

1128
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:44,890
you got my whole act.

1129
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,901
If you're eating it,

1130
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:46,511
pick up there,

1131
00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:47,410
feel free to just,

1132
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:52,570
and he would come back to that blow
job jokes hills if you go back to p,

1133
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:53,690
but you might want to wait,

1134
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,660
let the heat,

1135
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,200
but the heat dyad of that joke,

1136
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:01,990
it was fun for us because we
knew we would neither one of us.

1137
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:02,290
Shit.

1138
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,950
There was a a point in time where both
of us were doing like middling gigs and

1139
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:07,450
we really didn't have the time.

1140
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:09,760
We really didn't have
a real solid half hour,

1141
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,560
so it's just sometimes you just,

1142
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,250
when you,

1143
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:12,760
when were you,

1144
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,120
when you're a young comic and you
slip in the beginning of your set,

1145
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,610
like the odds of you pulling
stuff out of the fire.

1146
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,560
Oh yeah.

1147
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,690
I remember one time I was having a good
set and I knocked over a drink and I

1148
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:23,680
didn't address it.

1149
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,533
Yeah,

1150
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:24,881
there was,

1151
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:26,620
it just turned on me.

1152
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,050
Smelled blood.

1153
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,370
They knew I was scared.

1154
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:30,821
They knew I was,

1155
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:31,840
I was killing

1156
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,083
all of them out there.

1157
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,600
It's all about their
uncomfort and you denying.

1158
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,630
I remember being I,

1159
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,560
this was probably the cruelest
thing anybody ever did to
me when I was on stage.

1160
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,590
It was like,

1161
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:41,950
you know,

1162
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,180
half filled room back.

1163
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,940
It was always like the back of a Chinese
restaurant where they had a banquet

1164
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:48,300
room that they just put
a microphone up and,

1165
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:53,080
and call it a comedy night and I'm up
there tanking it and I'm not acknowledging

1166
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:53,914
that I'm tanking it.

1167
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,430
And during one of the silences that should
have had laughed rented after one of

1168
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,240
my jokes,

1169
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,580
I heard this middle aged woman
whispered to her husband,

1170
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,650
I could hear a whisper and she just goes,

1171
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,390
the poor bastard.

1172
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,023
Oh,

1173
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,580
worse than any heckle.

1174
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,410
Oh God.

1175
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,510
Jesus Christ.

1176
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,833
It is,

1177
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,570
it would be real hard when
we'd watch each other.

1178
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
You know your watch a friend
eat dick in the beginning too.

1179
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:26,250
Cause you know how devastating it,

1180
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,240
you know,

1181
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,010
there's some times where you know,

1182
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:32,280
this guy is not going to pull himself
out of this and he has 15 more minutes to

1183
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:33,114
go

1184
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,101
watch.

1185
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,210
I'm slosh through.

1186
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,580
Is there a way out of it?

1187
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:37,731
Do you,

1188
00:30:37,731 --> 00:30:38,630
what do you have to do?

1189
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,770
Like do you just have to
stop or do you just pets?

1190
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:43,400
We would go,

1191
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,920
yeah,

1192
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,960
that's where we'd steal anything.

1193
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:45,680
I Great Joe.

1194
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,270
I knew that there were grenades that
I had in my waistband that were Joe.

1195
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,960
Just take the fucking top off and
lob it and you're back in the game.

1196
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,680
We would help each other.

1197
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,690
There was a time where I was headlined
in where I had no fucking business

1198
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:02,460
headline and there was no way.

1199
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,510
I barely had 40 minutes and they were
letting me headline these rooms and I

1200
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:09,450
would have to stretch it all
out and if something went wrong,

1201
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:09,661
man,

1202
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:10,860
it went wrong hard.

1203
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,340
That's,

1204
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,710
there's no better motivation
to creating new material.

1205
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:14,544
Then when you just,

1206
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,450
those shows happen and you just
fucking half to get to a work.

1207
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,070
Like you need more weapons,

1208
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:20,371
man.

1209
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:21,750
You weren't on a weapons too quick.

1210
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,650
You're up there dying.

1211
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,071
Well,

1212
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:26,010
especially like you can do
the hour when it's going well.

1213
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,740
You can take that one bit
and you can stretch it out,

1214
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,670
add shit to it.

1215
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:30,071
You're here,

1216
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:32,820
you're doing improvisational
jazz and that our fills up.

1217
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,320
But when they're not laughing,

1218
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:36,210
all of a sudden it's like concentrate,

1219
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,470
everything shrinks down.

1220
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,650
And now what you had as 35 minutes,

1221
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,010
you just ripped through in
17 and now you're scared.

1222
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:47,810
So you're tense and then you got
nowhere to go except the crowds.

1223
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:49,080
So you start fucking with a craft.

1224
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,860
They don't like you now does that they,

1225
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:51,763
they don't like you.

1226
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,580
You're not making them comfortable.

1227
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,490
So there's not like a nice flow of energy.

1228
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,721
And so yeah,

1229
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:58,554
the early,

1230
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:58,920
yeah,

1231
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,520
feel it.

1232
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,870
And the thing about Boston is,

1233
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:02,520
and I think it was Kinda
unique to a lot of,

1234
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:02,880
uh,

1235
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,930
common other comedy cities
is it is a punchline town.

1236
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,220
It's Bam,

1237
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:08,760
Bam,

1238
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,241
Bam,

1239
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:09,660
Bam.

1240
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:09,961
You know,

1241
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,910
they don't want to see something esoteric.

1242
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:13,440
They don't want to see a storyteller.

1243
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,190
They want you to grab them and just
smack them around and then walk off stage

1244
00:32:17,191 --> 00:32:18,030
with your hands in the air.

1245
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,331
Well,

1246
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:18,580
there,

1247
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,040
there were guys that were doing
it that we're so good at the best.

1248
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:22,300
Yeah.

1249
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,060
We came up in an error where,

1250
00:32:24,061 --> 00:32:24,440
you know,

1251
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:24,720
we've,

1252
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,450
I've talked about this a hundred times
on the podcast and people always go,

1253
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:27,721
yeah,

1254
00:32:27,721 --> 00:32:27,921
yeah,

1255
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:28,171
yeah,

1256
00:32:28,171 --> 00:32:29,460
we know that we're really good comedians.

1257
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:30,240
Back then,

1258
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,560
I don't think people even understand
what it was like a utopia.

1259
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,290
Boston was like this
standup comedy utopia.

1260
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,220
There was at one point in
time there was five clubs

1261
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,540
in a tiny little area,

1262
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,910
seven night a week club.

1263
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,610
Yeah,

1264
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,800
I remember there was just that
one block of warrant warrant,

1265
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,380
Nick's comedy stop.

1266
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:51,020
And then there was duck soup and
there was a comedy connection.

1267
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,883
And then Mike,

1268
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,880
Mike Clark had the comedy club and the
Charles play house above the comedy.

1269
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,190
And then on the weekends you
cut over to Dick tardies,

1270
00:32:58,191 --> 00:32:59,024
comedy ball,

1271
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,170
50 yards away,

1272
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,133
craziness.

1273
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,360
And then you get in your car and you
drive down the stitches on comm ave.

1274
00:33:04,361 --> 00:33:04,611
It's like,

1275
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:05,420
Holy Shit.

1276
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,040
And the best part really was,

1277
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:07,400
um,

1278
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
and those were for short sets.

1279
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:09,291
You doing five,

1280
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,850
seven minutes with a big club.

1281
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,691
Those were the big ones.

1282
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:12,920
But then you and I would get,

1283
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:14,810
and this is the thing
people don't get today,

1284
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,700
is that we would get it for a year.

1285
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,620
We get either you get my car,

1286
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,220
I get in yours.

1287
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,960
We dragged providence one night for a
1520 minutes set for free all the time.

1288
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,250
Then we go to Hartford one night,

1289
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:26,510
then we go to Worcester one night,

1290
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:27,410
then we go to Maine.

1291
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:29,510
One night we would go anywhere.

1292
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:31,280
They'd give especially a longer set,

1293
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,511
and then you know,

1294
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:36,500
we were lucky enough to come up in a
time where the word comedy in front of a

1295
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:38,030
place drew a crowd.

1296
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,250
You didn't need to have a big name.

1297
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,080
They just were comedy crazy.

1298
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:47,081
And we just happen to be dropped in the
middle of it in a city that was a closed

1299
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:48,051
system.

1300
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,270
They didn't have headliners
come in from out of town.

1301
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,440
So the local,

1302
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:56,300
there were four or five big
local headliners that drew
and the and the and the

1303
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:56,661
club's.

1304
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,780
Otherwise they only booked
based on do you crush?

1305
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,620
Are you funny?

1306
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,550
Are you original?

1307
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,840
So it was a meritocracy and no one ever
thought they were going to get famous

1308
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,501
there.

1309
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:07,370
What career,

1310
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:08,930
if someone used the word career,

1311
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:10,310
people would have linked
with them confused,

1312
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:11,180
like what are you talking about?

1313
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,860
All anyone wanted to do

1314
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,870
was become a big Boston colic.

1315
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,310
Yeah.

1316
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,360
It's like the fame that you wanted was
just the being accepted amongst your

1317
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:20,890
peers and having crowds come to see you.

1318
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,860
That's it.

1319
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,650
That's what everybody expects to
see you I think wasn't until later.

1320
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:26,060
I think for us it was just,

1321
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,373
I can't,

1322
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:27,861
it's like,

1323
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:31,820
you know when your first fucking a girl
and you can't believe she's letting you

1324
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,370
fuck her after jerking off
for three straight years.

1325
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,010
That's what it was like when
I was doing standup in Boston.

1326
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:42,220
They're allowing me these stages that
I've watched since I was a teenager in all

1327
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:44,810
this and I'm on it and
they're letting me talk.

1328
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,673
That was it.

1329
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,663
That's all I needed.

1330
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,350
You know,

1331
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,070
one of the first guys I ever saw
do a live set was Tom cotter.

1332
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,320
Tom Cod was one of the first guys.

1333
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,470
He's our buddy from Boston is a great
guy and he was in like some sort of a,

1334
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:02,050
the first time I ever went out some
sort of an open mic night and uh,

1335
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:02,401
and,

1336
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,720
and he was like the first
guy that everyone on stage,

1337
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,100
I remember that.

1338
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,090
I swear to God,

1339
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:07,601
same thing.

1340
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:08,470
He was like a not,

1341
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,020
he had started maybe
two years ahead of us.

1342
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,540
That guy always used to bum me out.

1343
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,560
And the reason why I used to bum me out
cause he was so fucking funny to hang

1344
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:17,981
out with,

1345
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:22,330
but he wanted to take it down
a notch and he wanted to like,

1346
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,260
oh maybe,

1347
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,210
maybe I shouldn't go so
dirty and maybe I should.

1348
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,350
And you wanted to go do it.

1349
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:26,831
That's you.

1350
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:27,730
When you're at your best,

1351
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:28,600
you're a pervert.

1352
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,790
Crazy twisted.

1353
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,510
P is,

1354
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,170
he is one of the most twisted
dudes and I don't want to,

1355
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,580
I'd rather have him on,

1356
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:39,570
we should him on and do it
together because his stories,

1357
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,430
the shit that he would do,

1358
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,010
I can't,

1359
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,020
I just can't say it on the air
and I can see anything on the air.

1360
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,160
But the Shit Tom Cod are dead.

1361
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,650
It was what the first guys I know that
would walk around with his balls hanging

1362
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:52,250
out of his pants.

1363
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:52,520
Yeah.

1364
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,820
One of the first guys like no one
was doing that back when we were 20,

1365
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:56,001
you know,

1366
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:57,900
we were like 21 or whatever
the hell we were at.

1367
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,080
Tom Carter's walking around with
his balls hanging out of his pants.

1368
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,290
Jesus man,

1369
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,810
it'd be a Christmas party and all the
comics are there and he and he would have

1370
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:06,000
the hands on his hips still.

1371
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,020
It wasn't like he was hiding.

1372
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,860
Oh No.

1373
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,670
And uh,

1374
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,240
I remember at one point we were at
somebody's house and there was a dog,

1375
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,280
it was a Oliver's dog and it was a,

1376
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:15,690
he had rescued one of those,

1377
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:16,730
a grey hounds.

1378
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,330
I think Tom was putting a dill pickle
up its ass in the middle of the party.

1379
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,490
Like we were both beyond children.

1380
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,260
We were like fucking,

1381
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,010
we were like a collection of bad kids.

1382
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,003
Yeah.

1383
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,860
It was the fun part of the fun of having
a guy like Tom cotter too is because

1384
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:34,870
you knew that he would like
do something like that.

1385
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:36,430
You knew he would want up things.

1386
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:36,740
Yeah.

1387
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,790
You knew if there was a bunch
of comics hang it around,

1388
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,990
Carter would find a way to
make something fucked up.

1389
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,200
I always felt like he kind of
pulled back on stage though,

1390
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,870
you know?

1391
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,291
Well he,

1392
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:45,531
yeah,

1393
00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:46,190
he um,

1394
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,120
in terms of practical jokes and
like guys like Kevin Knox May,

1395
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:53,990
he rest in peace was one of
those guys just so fucking funny.

1396
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,010
Offstage and so me cotter and Nazi or
working at a place in Maine called the

1397
00:36:58,011 --> 00:36:59,570
laughing lobster,

1398
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,900
which started to have slow business and
suddenly burnt down in the middle of a

1399
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:05,720
wet summer.

1400
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,520
And so we're up there
and we're staying in,

1401
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:09,370
there's a condo complex
that we're staying at,

1402
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:13,010
which was pretty upscale and they got
a pool and it was all these hot fucking

1403
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:14,920
chicks from Montreal to
come down to that part of,

1404
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:15,151
of,

1405
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,180
of Maine.

1406
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,421
So we go,

1407
00:37:17,421 --> 00:37:19,460
we're going to go down to the pool
and I don't have my bathing suit.

1408
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:19,761
And I were like,

1409
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:20,150
fuck it.

1410
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,320
You got boxer shorts,

1411
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:22,580
she's where your boxer shorts down.

1412
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,280
So they head down and I
walked down to the pool.

1413
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:27,830
I opened the gate and I walk in and it's
packed and there on the far end of the

1414
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:28,460
pool,

1415
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,370
and I may get about halfway down the
pool and they both stand up and start

1416
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:31,940
screaming.

1417
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,660
Greg,

1418
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,490
what are you doing in your underwear
at the whole fucking bull says

1419
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,550
red faced and ran back to the god

1420
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,730
set me up the whole

1421
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,250
[inaudible]

1422
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,460
cheer up fucking human being.
