1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,350
Low Freak bitches,
everybody's so freaked out

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,660
and heroin was more of like an eyelash
for the vagina,

3
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:10,300
for periods and stuff.
So when wouldn't get everywhere and

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,430
that's why girls are,
that's not what it is.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,030
The uh,
the butthole hair was always disturbing

6
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:15,751
though.
Yeah.

7
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:18,480
I don't like nobody ever liked the
buddle here because some girls just did

8
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,640
not know what they were doing when it
came to wiping.

9
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,730
And back then nobody had a bad day and
nobody had baby wipes.

10
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,570
It was toilet paper.
Sometimes some of it stuck around.

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,430
So you get this little joints for a
little gi.

12
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:34,431
Joe figures
super tightly rolled up.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,000
Did you know those little shit joint?
Yeah.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,360
Could you know those little notes?
Trimmers that you buy?

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,610
You use that for your asshole also.
You can't.

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,483
Yeah,

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,780
I was unaware of the.
Well,

18
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:52,930
it's not rocket science.
It's not like trying to figure out solar

19
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,290
power,
nose hair trimmers on your eyes.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,140
It's just if it cuts hair cuts,
hair,

21
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,950
it just does.
And it doesn't like cut you and stuff.

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,110
Well,
couldn't you get like one of those face

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,720
shavers?
A little nice ones down there with your

24
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:06,370
ass.
So you have a shaving your ass here.

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,930
Oh,
I just leave my girls.

26
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,280
You know what though?
You could do a way better job of

27
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,200
cleaning it if you're an asshole is
shaved,

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,350
but your asshole will grow that hair
back like wild Bush and then in a couple

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,130
days you'll be just squeezing your ass
cheeks everywhere you go to keep from

30
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:25,930
just digging in there,
brushing.

31
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,700
Just clawing at your asshole like a wolf
trying to bury a Caribou.

32
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,920
That stubble and ball stubble.
All stumbles are.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,990
How come they face?
Double?

34
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,180
Barely bothers me.
My head stubble does it.

35
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,590
Like I got a of double up here right
now.

36
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:46,270
No,
it doesn't bother me at all.

37
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,240
But Jesus Christ,
my asshole.

38
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,330
Moving around in your chair when you
wipe your ass and he grabbed like a

39
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:56,860
bundle of hair on the way out.

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,340
You know it's the best man.
One Wipe Charlie's.

41
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:06,270
You ever tried that?
I want them so bad but it's like a dude

42
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:07,710
wipe.
Like that kind of a thing.

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,170
Like a baby wipe they made.
They made for men,

44
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,150
but they don't smell like flowers.
Like you just got asked by a flower for

45
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,310
it anymore.
Yeah.

46
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,860
Well I.
That Japanese thing is the shit man.

47
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,490
Isn't gonna install one in here?
Yeah.

48
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,050
I'm going to install it in here
eventually.

49
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,280
Does it shoot
the shit hanging out for an hour?

50
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,000
He's a high pressure wind pressure,
water.

51
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,790
Warm Air.
It dries your asshole off.

52
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,210
There's two different speeds to the
water shoots in your asshole totos.

53
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,240
It also cleans your vagina.
If you're a Gal,

54
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,940
he cleans your badge area.
You can back your badge up,

55
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,230
get a little tingly,
tingly,

56
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:48,290
and if you know a little time and you
know.

57
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,280
Do you went to Joseph Cao?
We went to Japan.

58
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:57,280
I just sat there for seriously for a
half hour with the one shooting in my

59
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:00,520
asshole because it just felt so because
it hit like the back wall,

60
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,590
but hold that long.
I'd have to do it to feel like I was

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,220
getting clean.
I still have to do paper afterwards.

62
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,163
No,
no.

63
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,650
You didn't walk out with worried.
It was so clean.

64
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,980
I mean it was like taking a shower for
your butthole.

65
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,980
Yeah,
pretty meticulous.

66
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,130
You not doing as good a job.
I'm telling you,

67
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,380
you're just mirroring.
Even if you're using baby wipes,

68
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,570
you just smearing.
Show over your hair.

69
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.
Imagine if I took some shit and I just

70
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,860
rubbed into the top of your head.
You like,

71
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,460
I'm good.
I got a baby wipe.

72
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,920
But if I had never you would never
accept that.

73
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,070
But if I get in the shower and you would
clean your asshole here,

74
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,790
fair enough.
But.

75
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,050
But if you told me,
you told me I had 70 baby wipes and a

76
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,730
roll of toilet paper.
I take a shoulder again,

77
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,000
shower.
Jesus Christ.

78
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,450
That was a choice.
This fork and shit all day too.

79
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,430
Don't worry about it.
I rubbed it with 70 baby wipes.

80
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,680
I be like,
that's not enough.

81
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:00,130
You've got to watch this fucking thing.
You got to get it in the washing

82
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,420
machine.
I didn't these hot water and Sun.

83
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,830
But again,
let's say baby wipes and paper,

84
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,110
just trying to get my method approved.
It's still shit.

85
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,710
Pick shower after the shower.
It's

86
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,780
unfair to say.
I mean,

87
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,560
I don't do anything.
I don't go out for the day though,

88
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:21,280
until I shower after I stand up or to
wipe or sit down,

89
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,120
stand up and sitting down even a
possibility.

90
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,630
Fuck wipes or asked.
Sitting down.

91
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,070
You must have cuffs.
Cuffs.

92
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,170
I don't do it.
He does.

93
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,200
I wanted you to do,
man.

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,900
I stayed in that.
Find a target.

95
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,203
Stand up,
stand up.

96
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,820
Stand up or sit down.
No,

97
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,220
there's people.
Most people sit in their sleeves,

98
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,480
smelled or watch.
Guarantee you.

99
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,040
One more quick.
One of my buddies told me he goes from

100
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:52,390
the front between his smell,
his balls.

101
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,880
Oh yeah.
Christ.

102
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,820
You don't.
He's going to have some.

103
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,220
Damn.
Do you pay attention to all of the

104
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,080
scientific research that's being done in
genetic engineering and changing?

105
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,780
Is there anything?
Yeah.

106
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,540
Like um,
they actually identified the dwarf gene,

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,960
like they've been able to identify the
gene that causes dwarfism.

108
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,410
And this debate has gone on as their,
as the technology keeps getting closer

109
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:21,130
to the point where we can actually do
this,

110
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,090
but there's a debate going is if we can
remove that gene,

111
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,780
if we can prevent your child from having
dwarfism,

112
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,973
should we.

113
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,570
And a lot of dwarves were like,
no,

114
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,010
we shouldn't do it.
It's playing God,

115
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:34,190
it's stump up and,
and I'm,

116
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,190
I'm there going,
yeah,

117
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,700
you should absolutely remove it.
Yeah,

118
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,350
absolutely.
Why would you want your kid to go

119
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,220
through?
I mean,

120
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:44,320
granted I've been lucky at like,
like I said,

121
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:49,321
I've only had like one surgery and I
made a good career with the hand that I

122
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,600
was dealt,
but there's a lot of little people I

123
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,280
know that,
that haven't,

124
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:57,530
that don't.
And then get constantly made of their

125
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,600
entire lives are hidden away by their
parents.

126
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:03,950
Why would you want your kid to go
through that and as a dwarf,

127
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,960
you know,
what struggles that you had growing up,

128
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,080
why would you,
why would you intentionally put those

129
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,110
pains on your child?
I don't understand that.

130
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,090
I don't.

131
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,400
It's hard to understand a lot of
decisions that people make,

132
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,650
a lot of rationalizations that people
may.

133
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:17,900
Yeah,

134
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,733
like,
um,

135
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,310
like one reason that I'm able to be a
comedian and sort of have this sense of

136
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:26,030
humor about it is because my dad was
amazing,

137
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:29,510
is amazing.
Like when I was born he found out that I

138
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:34,511
was going to be a dwarf so he would go
to these LPA little people of America

139
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,050
meetings and he would find out about it
and he was like,

140
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:41,300
Oh shit,
my kid's gonna get made fun of a lot.

141
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,560
Like his life is going to be weird.
So his philosophy was when I was growing

142
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,270
up,
he would make fun of me first,

143
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,780
but he would do it in a supportive way.
Like he would fuck with me,

144
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:51,411
but then say,
okay,

145
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,150
I just insulted you,
hit me back with something,

146
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,060
hit me back and then get.
Because this is going to happen to you

147
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,660
later.
Bye.

148
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,670
Was like training you.

149
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,420
Yeah.
So by the time I got to kindergarten I

150
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,020
like,
I remember kindergarten walking in in a,

151
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,960
a kid just laughing at me going,
hi,

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,480
you're little.
And I looked at him and went,

153
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,950
ah,
your mom doesn't live with your dad

154
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:13,530
anymore.
And kindergarten and kindergarten and

155
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,620
fucking like,
I got sent to the principal's office for

156
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:17,750
like,
like hurting this kid's feelings.

157
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,240
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

158
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,950
And,
and,

159
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,310
and they call my deadline like we're
going to call your father.

160
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,510
I'm like,
fucking do it.

161
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,160
You trained you to be a comedian.
Kind of did.

162
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,100
Because now like when I get a heckler,
it's like,

163
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:31,760
do you think you're going to say
anything to me that I haven't heard on

164
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:34,720
the street that I haven't heard walking
down and some kid having,

165
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,060
like saying a comment like I've had.
I've had parents bring their children up

166
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:45,290
to me when the line is too long at the
mall Santa and go,

167
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,580
hey,
tell this guy what,

168
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,450
what you want.
I've had that happen to mayor.

169
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:49,620
I

170
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,000
want to talk to you about some shit
dude.

171
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,690
I was working out in my gym yesterday
dying.

172
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,850
Okay.
All I'm doing is hitting pads.

173
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,070
No one's hitting me back.
I'm fucking exhausted.

174
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,720
And when I like to do,
when I'm,

175
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:04,380
when I'm working out is I like to put
fights on for motivation and I'm

176
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:09,381
watching you and you're,
you're fighting in the last man standing

177
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:11,720
tournament.
You got to fight three times this.

178
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,110
This night.
You're,

179
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:17,760
you're fighting you,
you're going for fucking rounds.

180
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,760
Exhausting,
ridiculous fight.

181
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,890
And then our member,
this shit.

182
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,350
Oh Shit.
Oops,

183
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,500
I just dropped elvis.
Elvis has left the building.

184
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,270
I remember this shit.
Brian sent me this picture.

185
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,960
What the fuck dude.
How are you able to have that kind of

186
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:37,890
cardio?
I mean,

187
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,470
you fought three times that night for
four rounds.

188
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:45,100
The first fight before you.
You won by knockout and you're,

189
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,530
you're smoking cigarettes.

190
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah.
How's that possible?

191
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,720
Oh Joe,
I didn't want to talk about this last

192
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:53,760
time.
When was this?

193
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,480
When was the cigarette?
That cigarette was right after the fight

194
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,314
with,
uh,

195
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,980
Robert Thomas in the dressing room.
Ryan lochte Loco.

196
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:03,870
Shut up in my dressing room before I got
in the shower.

197
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,120
And it was like taking pictures and I'm
like,

198
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,440
he's like,
can I,

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,240
can I take,
I won't take a photo on my grind.

200
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:12,300
Just take the picture.
Here it is.

201
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,910
Now.
When you fought in a tournament,

202
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,920
you didn't have any cigarettes in
between fights or anything.

203
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:18,700
Did you have to assignment?
I went outside and had a

204
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,100
true story.
Oh my God.

205
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:25,200
You got a cigarette and then fought
twice more.

206
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,960
Yeah.
It's coming to an end up getting really

207
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:30,480
sick of smoking and I'm getting really
sick of explaining,

208
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,440
having this conversation.
Joe Joe's the reason when I quit.

209
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,790
This will be the reason.
