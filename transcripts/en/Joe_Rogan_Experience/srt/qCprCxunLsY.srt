1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,970
Hello Freak bitches,
everybody so freaked,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,980
doubt and,
and hair was more of like an eyelash for

3
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:10,070
the vagina for periods and stuff so it
wouldn't get everywhere.

4
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:12,470
And that's why girls are,
that's not what it is.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,030
The uh,
the butthole hair was always disturbing

6
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:15,721
though.
Yeah.

7
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:18,840
I don't like nobody ever liked the
buddle air cause some girls just did not

8
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:20,640
know what they're doing when it came to
wiping.

9
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,730
And back then nobody had a big day and
nobody had baby wipes.

10
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,550
It was toilet paper.
Sometimes some of it stuck around

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,260
joints for a little gi joe figures
super tightly rolled up.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,360
Did you know those little shit joint
could,

13
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:44,340
you know there's little notes trimmers
that you buy.

14
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:46,590
You use that for your asshole also.
You can't,

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,900
yeah,
I was unaware of the,

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,970
yeah.
Well it's not rocket science.

17
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:53,340
It's not like trying to figure out solar
power,

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,610
nose hair trimmers on your eyes.
It's just,

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,220
if it cuts hair cuts,
hair,

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,410
you know,
it just does.

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,420
And it doesn't like cut you and stuff.
Well,

22
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,590
couldn't you get like one of those face
shavers?

23
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:04,950
A little nice ones down there with your
ass?

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,960
You know my shaving your ass all hair.
Oh I just leave my watering and girls.

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,270
You know what though?
You could do a way better job of

26
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:17,271
cleaning it if your asshole is shaved,
but your asshole will grow that hair

27
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:22,281
back like a wild Bush and then in a
couple of days you'll be just squeezing

28
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:25,170
your ass cheeks everywhere he go to keep
from just digging in.

29
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,410
They're clawing at your asshole like a
wolf trying to bury at Caribou.

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,010
Flicking that stubble.
I get enough double and ball stubble.

31
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:41,910
All symbols are how come my face double
barely bothers me.

32
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,610
My head stubble does like I got a lot of
double up here right now.

33
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:46,260
No,
doesn't bother me at all.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,440
But Jesus Christ my hall,
I just

35
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,880
moving around in your chair just good
when you wipe your ass and he'd grab

36
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,890
like a bundle of hair on the way out.

37
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,330
You know what's the best man?
One wipe charlies.

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,900
You ever try the,
I want them so bad.

39
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,060
It's like a big dude wipe like that kind
of a thing where he use a baby wipe.

40
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,170
They made.
They made from men,

41
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,470
but they don't smell like flowers.
Like you just got ass fucked by a flower

42
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,300
forest anymore.
Yeah.

43
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,860
Well I that Japanese thing is the shit
man.

44
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,250
Yeah.
Isn't gonna install one in here?

45
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,540
Yeah,
I'm going to install it in here

46
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,620
eventually.
Does it shoot like high pressure water?

47
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,360
Loving the shit.
Hang out for an hour.

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,970
It's a high pressure water pressure.
Water,

49
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:35,790
warm air.
It dries your ass hole off.

50
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,440
There's two different speeds to the
water.

51
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:41,460
It's shoots in your asshole totos Ooh.
It also cleans your vagina.

52
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,740
If you're a Gal,
he cleans your vagina area.

53
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:45,780
You can back your badge up,
get a little tingly,

54
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:48,570
tingly and if you know he has a little
time and the alcohol.

55
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,260
What do you went to join the Gal we went
to Japan.

56
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,440
I just sat there for seriously for a
half hour with the,

57
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:59,890
the one shooting and my asshole because
it just felt so because it hit like the

58
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,160
back wall of your app,
but hold that long.

59
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,450
I'd have to do it to feel like I was
like getting cla.

60
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,210
I still feel that have to do paper
afterwards.

61
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,150
No,
no,

62
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,650
you don't even walk.
I was worried it was so clean.

63
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,020
I mean it was like taking a shower for
your butthole.

64
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,260
Pretty meticulous.
You can not doing as good a job.

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,240
I'm telling you,
you just smearing.

66
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,300
Even if you use baby wipes,
you just smearing the show over your

67
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:22,961
hair.
Okay.

68
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,620
Imagine if I took some shit and it just
rubbed into the top of your head.

69
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,401
You're like,
I'm good.

70
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,590
I got a baby.
Wipe the fuck

71
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,950
you ain't never accept that.

72
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,050
But if I had to get in the shower and
you would clean your asshole there,

73
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,790
fair enough.
But,

74
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,050
but if you told me,
you told me I have 70 baby wipes in a

75
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,190
row,
toilet paper,

76
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,830
I'd take a show there and get in the
shower.

77
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,600
Jesus Christ.
Oh No,

78
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:51,480
that was a choice.
Quit this fork and shit all day too.

79
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,430
Don't worry about it.
I rubbed it with 70 baby wipes.

80
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,590
I be like,
ah,

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,150
that's not enough.
You've got to watch this fucking thing.

82
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,580
You got to get it in the washing
machine.

83
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,630
It needs hot water.
It's sons.

84
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,830
But again,
let's say baby wipes and Willie Vapor,

85
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,250
just try to get my method approved.
It's still shut your pick shower before

86
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,420
the shower
and fairness.

87
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:14,800
Yeah.
I mean,

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,830
I don't do anything.
I don't go out for the day though until

89
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:21,310
I shower after I should stand up or to
wipe or a sit down.

90
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,100
Stand up as sitting down.
Even a possibility.

91
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,980
Fuck wipes are asked sitting down.
You must have really shitty cups.

92
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,700
What are your cuffs?
I don't do it.

93
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,010
He does.
I wanted you to do.

94
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:31,900
It's like I stayed in that find a
target.

95
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,490
Hit Up.
Jamie,

96
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,990
do you stand up or sit down?
No,

97
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,160
there's people,
most people sit and like their sleeves

98
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,600
smelled or watch guaranteed
shit.

99
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,740
One of my buddies told me he goes from
the front here,

100
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:52,390
like reach up between his legs and
plausible smell his balls.

101
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,070
Oh yeah.
How'd you Jesus Christ.

102
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,070
You don't,
he's an ass.

103
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,250
Damn.
Do you pay attention to all of the

104
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,080
scientific research that's being done in
genetic engineering and changing?

105
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,750
Is there anything that's on,
yeah,

106
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,570
like um,
they actually identified the Dwarf Jean,

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,600
like they've been able to identify the
gene that causes dwarfism and this

108
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:19,720
debate has gone on as their,
as the technology keeps getting closer

109
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:21,160
to the point where we could actually do
this.

110
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,100
But there's some debate going is if we
can remove that gene,

111
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,810
if we can prevent your child from having
dwarfism,

112
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,390
should we,
and a lot of dwarves were like,

113
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,230
no,
we shouldn't do it.

114
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,420
It's playing God.
It's stumped.

115
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,470
And I'm,
I'm there going,

116
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
yeah,
you should absolutely remove it.

117
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,350
Absolutely.
Why would you want your kid to go

118
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,220
through?
I mean,

119
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,730
granted,
I've been lucky at like,

120
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,740
like I said,
I've only had one surgery and I made a

121
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,770
good career with the hand that I was
dealt.

122
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,110
But there's a lot of little people I
know that,

123
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,590
that haven't,
that don't that and then get constantly

124
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:59,600
made fun of their entire lives are
hidden away by their parents.

125
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:03,950
Why would you want your kid to go
through that and as a dwarf,

126
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,990
you know,
what struggles that you had growing up?

127
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,080
Why would you,
why would you intentionally put those

128
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,170
pains on your child?
I don't understand that.

129
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,120
I don't,

130
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,430
it's hard to understand a lot of
decisions that people make.

131
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,440
Yeah.
A lot of rationalizations that people

132
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:17,900
may,
yeah.

133
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,733
Like,
um,

134
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,310
like one reason that I'm able to be a
comedian and sort of have this sense of

135
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:26,030
humor about it is because my dad was
amazing,

136
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,190
is amazing.
Uh,

137
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,020
like when I was born,
he found out that I was going to be a

138
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,140
dwarf.
So he would go to these,

139
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,430
uh,
LPA,

140
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,050
little people of America meetings and he
would find out about it and he was like,

141
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,300
Oh shit,
my kid's going to get made fun of a lot.

142
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,560
Like his life is going to be weird.
So his philosophy was when I was growing

143
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,270
up,
he would make fun of me first,

144
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,670
but he would do it in like,
in like a supportive way.

145
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,110
Like he would fuck with me,
but then say,

146
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,190
okay,
I just insulted you,

147
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:54,690
hit me back with something,
hit me back and then get,

148
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,420
cause th this is going to happen to you
later.

149
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,670
Bye.
It's like training you.

150
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,290
Yeah.
So by the time I got to kindergarten I

151
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,950
like,
I remember kindergarten walking in in a

152
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:07,010
a kid just laughing at me going,
ha ha,

153
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,480
you're little.
And I looked at him and went,

154
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,950
ha ha,
your mom doesn't live with your dad

155
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:14,510
anymore and kindergarten,
kindergarten and fucking like I got sent

156
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:17,750
to the principal's office for like,
like hurting this kid's feelings.

157
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,220
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

158
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,100
And like,
and they call my dad,

159
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,310
we're like,
we're going to call your father.

160
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,510
I'm like,
fucking do it.

161
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,210
You turned you to be a co comedian.
Kind of did.

162
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,100
Because now like when I get a heckler,
it's like,

163
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:31,760
do you think you're going to say
anything to me that I haven't heard on

164
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:35,300
the street that I haven't heard walking
down and some kid having would be like

165
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:40,301
saying a comment like I've had,
I've had parents bring their children up

166
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:45,290
to me when the line is too long at the
mall Santa and go,

167
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,580
hey,
tell this guy what,

168
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,450
what you want or you've had that happen
to mayor.

169
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,000
I want to talk to you about some shit,
dude.

170
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,100
Let's stop.
Because I was working out in my gym

171
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,260
yesterday dying.
Okay.

172
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,930
All I'm doing is hitting pads.
No one's hitting me back.

173
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,300
I'm fucking exhausted.
And when I like to do,

174
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:02,340
when I'm,
when I'm working on is I like to put

175
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:06,510
fights on for motivation and I'm
watching you and uh,

176
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,490
you're,
you're fighting in the,

177
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:11,730
the last man standing tournament.
You got to fight three times this,

178
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,050
this night.
You're,

179
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:17,730
you're fighting you,
you're going for fucking rounds.

180
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,760
Exhausting.
Ridiculous fight.

181
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,700
And then I remember this shit.
Oh Shit.

182
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,610
Oops.
We just dropped elvis.

183
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,910
Elvis has left the building.
Yeah,

184
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,640
I remember this shit,
right.

185
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,710
Brian Logan sent me this picture.
What the fuck,

186
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:36,960
dude?
How are you able to have that kind of

187
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:37,890
cardio?
I mean,

188
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,480
you fought three times that night for
four rounds.

189
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:41,850
The first fight before you,
uh,

190
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,501
you,
uh,

191
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:46,530
won by knockout and you're,
you're smoking cigarettes.

192
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,030
Yeah.
How's that possible?

193
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,613
Oh,
Joe,

194
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,930
I didn't want to talk about this last
time.

195
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,990
When was this?
When was the cigarette?

196
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,780
That cigarette was right after the fight
with,

197
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:00,930
uh,
Robert Thomas in the dressing room.

198
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,330
Ryan lochte Loco.
Shut up my dress from him before I got

199
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,120
in the shower and it was like taking
pictures and I'm like,

200
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,440
he's like,
can I,

201
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,760
can I take,
I won't take a photo.

202
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:09,241
I'm like,
Ryan,

203
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:12,330
just take the picture.
Here it is.

204
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,910
Now,
when you fought in the tournament,

205
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,920
you didn't have any cigarettes in
between fights or anything?

206
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:20,550
Did you have to assignment?
I went outside and how necessary true

207
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,100
story.
Oh my God.

208
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:25,200
You had a cigarette and then fought
twice more.

209
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,930
Yeah.
It's coming to an end up getting really

210
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,480
sick of smoking and I'm getting really
sick of explaining,

211
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,440
having this conversation.
Joe Joe's the reason when I quit,

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,833
this will be the reason.

213
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,160
Okay.
