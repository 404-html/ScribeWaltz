1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,090
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,500
You reached out to me about,

3
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:05,334
uh,

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,710
people asking questions
about psychedelics,

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,190
fielding questions about psychedelic.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,300
Where was the,

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,250
what was the motivation behind that?

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,623
Uh,

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,550
I saw a tweet from a young
man hit me up and he was,

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,110
he simply asked me,

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,920
uh,

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,461
you know,

13
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,820
how much you should take some shrooms.

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,550
And I,

15
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,911
I don't know.

16
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:27,744
I was just,

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,441
I just saw it.

18
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:28,710
I was like,

19
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,543
oh,

20
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,240
okay.

21
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,720
I gave him a response and I
didn't think nothing of it,

22
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,730
but then I saw a lot of people
responded and I was like,

23
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:35,911
oh,

24
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,510
this is cool.

25
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,970
The other people were asking me
questions and then now it's like,

26
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,804
Holy Shit,

27
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,993
this could be bad.

28
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,860
It's gonna be really bad.

29
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,821
But then it's like,

30
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:46,520
you know what the IMU,

31
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,370
Big Brother Shit,

32
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:50,490
like if they're gonna do drugs
and they want to know about it,

33
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:52,320
at least asked me to come to me,

34
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,101
you know,

35
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,660
I'll give you the real shit.

36
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,490
You know,

37
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,350
you want him to ask.

38
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,900
Somebody asked me.

39
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,500
Um,

40
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,330
and that's Kinda how I looked at it.

41
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:01,040
And,

42
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,620
uh,

43
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,790
it ended up being this thing.

44
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,060
But then I know that you talk about
psychedelics and you have specifically

45
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:06,960
talked about DMT,

46
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,870
cause I answered the question about
Dmt and that's why I was like,

47
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:09,991
man,

48
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:11,700
we should talk about this with Joe.

49
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:12,541
You know,

50
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,740
cause I know that I,

51
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,830
I mean I can't sit down with
anybody and talk about the empty,

52
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,970
even some of my friends,

53
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,820
I've told them that I've done it and
they've like looked at me in a way where

54
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:21,654
it's like,

55
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,071
you know,

56
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:23,431
it's like,

57
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,264
Whoa,

58
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,253
you did duty.

59
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
It's a game changer,

60
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:26,761
man.

61
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,051
Yeah,

62
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:27,190
Pete,

63
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,450
a lot.

64
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,180
But that lets me know that there's people
that don't understand it and they're

65
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,350
not educated about it.

66
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,920
And so they just kind of
hear these stories and uh,

67
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,340
that's all I was like,

68
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:35,551
man,

69
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:39,330
it would be dope to if we just sat down
and talked about it and educate some

70
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,890
people because I just know it's,

71
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,720
I mean even some people
are scared of acid.

72
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,680
It's a scary thing,

73
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,131
you know,

74
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:44,964
I tell people,

75
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,890
I remember this is a true story.

76
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,180
Um,

77
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,013
I hope so.

78
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,023
But

79
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,610
this is kind of like one
of those things where,

80
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:53,851
you know,

81
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,740
I'm not throwing this kid under the bus,

82
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,221
but you know,

83
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:57,120
it's just a reality.

84
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:57,861
Um,

85
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:58,070
I was,

86
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,920
was at Coachella,

87
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,780
we were backstage or
ran in the Wiz Khalifa,

88
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,590
uh,

89
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,350
you know,

90
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,050
I see him,

91
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,411
you know,

92
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:03,901
often,

93
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:07,600
and he was telling me he was doing shrooms
or whatever and experiment mushrooms

94
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,981
and I was like,

95
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:08,401
Oh man,

96
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:09,234
you should do acid.

97
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,850
And he was just like,

98
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,683
no.

99
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:11,881
I was like,

100
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,361
Oh man,

101
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:12,491
we,

102
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:12,691
you know,

103
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:12,991
shootings,

104
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:15,180
just like the training wheels are
fucking psychedelics and shit.

105
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:15,490
You know,

106
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,950
it's like he's an old man.

107
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:17,880
I'm not fucking with that though.

108
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,360
You can just tell that it was just maybe,

109
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,190
maybe he might've known somebody who had
a bad trip or he heard some bad things,

110
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,000
but like there was like
fear and I was just like,

111
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,863
oh,

112
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,461
it's like man,

113
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,300
it's just people.

114
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,110
People are kind of like taken back
when you say you do acid sometimes.

115
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,970
And even when I talk about it on Twitter,

116
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:39,511
people would be like,

117
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:39,870
Whoa,

118
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,320
chill.

119
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,250
You want some other shit?

120
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:41,641
And it's like,

121
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,001
man,

122
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:42,834
like,

123
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,610
I mean,

124
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,360
well that's the one we're going crazy.

125
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:47,790
Yeah.

126
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,623
But I don't,

127
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,490
you can go crazy drinking too much.

128
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,841
It's so,

129
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:52,674
I don't really,

130
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,380
you never had a bad trip on acid?

131
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:55,711
Yeah,

132
00:02:55,711 --> 00:03:00,460
but it wasn't because of me is because I
let some other motherfucker come in the

133
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:03,550
situation that wasn't ready with his shit.

134
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,840
You know,

135
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,690
you know how some people come in and try
to act like they do this and don't do

136
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:12,460
this and you know you have situations
like that but I just have a bad trip and

137
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,000
you got dragged along because you gotta
you gotta make sure everybody's cool and

138
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:16,860
you want to,

139
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,170
you know,

140
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,830
help people out.

141
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,311
You don't want to leave.

142
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,130
Nobody abandoned.

143
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,601
Not feel like,

144
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:23,410
that's the big thing with psychedelics
is if you're doing it with people,

145
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,790
no matter if you know them well or not,

146
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,550
you don't want to really
leave nobody hanging.

147
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:27,971
You know?

148
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:28,804
And you want to,

149
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,240
you want to try to find a common ground.

150
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,350
Cause everybody tripping,

151
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:32,981
you know?

152
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:33,814
And it's like,

153
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,380
you know,

154
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,971
everybody,

155
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:37,510
at the end of the day we just tripping.

156
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,350
And it's scary because somebody
gets to be like woman minute.

157
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,350
He was trying to kill me.

158
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,430
No,

159
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,263
it's so

160
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,653
bad.

161
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,110
I've never had no shit like that.

162
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,910
And I'm pretty sure people
have dealt with that though.

163
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,520
Um,

164
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,720
and the second thing is,

165
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,500
and this is what the,

166
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,720
this is the real problem I
think in higher education,

167
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:54,201
which makes me,

168
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,440
it makes me crazy every
single day is that right now,

169
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,150
higher ed in particular in the social
sciences and humanities is on lockdown by

170
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:03,320
the academic left.

171
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,040
Okay.

172
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,560
And I come out of the left and
I'm left wing in a lot of ways.

173
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:07,460
And in some ways I'm not.

174
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:12,461
But what I hate is that there's just
almost no variety of discourse on college

175
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,180
campuses that pretty much it.

176
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,210
And if there's been studies done,

177
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:21,260
I mean like 95% of English and
history professors voted for Obama.

178
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:21,620
Right.

179
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,380
I mean that tells you right there that
there's not a whole lot of debate going

180
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:24,950
on.

181
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,000
Why do you think that is?

182
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,451
Why,

183
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:31,451
why is academia and the left
sort of inexorably connected?

184
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:31,731
Yeah.

185
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:31,941
Well,

186
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:35,030
so when a lot of left
academics are asked this,

187
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:37,670
the answer that they give
you is we're smarter,

188
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,570
right,

189
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:39,830
right.

190
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,550
So that we,

191
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,241
it's just in tiff,

192
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:42,230
you're intelligent and study,

193
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,280
you will come to that position.

194
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:45,140
Now I said it because right.

195
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,180
Is kinda inexorably connected to religion
because Christianity and the right are

196
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:51,290
pretty much inseparable.

197
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,160
But even point,

198
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,610
even libertarians who are
atheists get run out of the house,

199
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,170
you can't get a job as a libertarian.

200
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,183
Wow.

201
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,060
Um,

202
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,301
no,

203
00:04:59,301 --> 00:04:59,541
I mean,

204
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,251
so it's,

205
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:01,280
it's all historical,

206
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:01,581
right?

207
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,590
So if you look at the
history of higher education,

208
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,970
and a lot of people forget this,

209
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,620
you know,

210
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,390
a higher education in this country
is only about two centuries old.

211
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,340
And as a major mass institution,

212
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:11,174
I mean,

213
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,410
uh,

214
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,430
the right,

215
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,970
right wing conservatives controlled
the joint until the 1960s.

216
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,271
Right?

217
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:21,650
So what was being taught at Harvard and
Yale and Princeton and cow and Ucla,

218
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,820
uh,

219
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,380
was things like capitalism is awesome
and black people are inferior and women

220
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:28,250
should be in the home.

221
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,551
I mean,

222
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:29,020
it was,

223
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,250
the Conservatives had that
whole place on lockdown.

224
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,360
Uh,

225
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,530
there was a monoculture on,

226
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,221
on the campuses.

227
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:37,610
Then what comes along is the
1960s and all those movements,

228
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,600
although social movements,

229
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:39,560
so the antiwar movement,

230
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:40,430
the civil rights movement,

231
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:41,121
feminist movement,

232
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:41,451
et Cetera,

233
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:42,284
et cetera.

234
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,850
And what happened was those people,

235
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:47,540
because their movements either sort
of succeeded and they considered were

236
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:51,410
considered to be done or
they couldn't succeed,

237
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,720
they couldn't really create
a radical revolution,

238
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:54,620
the kind that they wanted.

239
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,540
The only place they found that they
could go and have a job was colleges as

240
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,081
professors.

241
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:00,650
So they,

242
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,200
on Moss though that generation,

243
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:07,430
the new left of the 1960s went into
graduate school and they all became

244
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,270
professors and that's,

245
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,870
he's been basically teaching
college for the last 50 years.

246
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,453
Um,

247
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,150
so I'm,

248
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,520
I'm of the generation
that was trained by them.

249
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,041
And so there,

250
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,500
there's some changes going on,

251
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,120
but basically most,

252
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:21,140
even most people my age,

253
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:21,771
I'm in my forties,

254
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:23,030
but in my generation,

255
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,090
most of us are still sort of
influenced by that generation.

256
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:28,040
So it was this very concerted,

257
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,180
not a conspiracy,

258
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,610
but it was a pretty deliberate
attempt in some ways.

259
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:34,580
It was conscious to take over
the university that that was the,

260
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,300
that was the only place we could have
this radical discourse and get paid for it

261
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,170
and have a career.

262
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:39,500
Right.

263
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,390
I never wanted a late night talk show.

264
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:42,380
It just ended up being,

265
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,910
that was the format that they called it.

266
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,110
Like I just wanted to show and they said
it comes on at a law after 11 and I'm

267
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:48,680
like okay,

268
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,513
come on at eight.

269
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,160
But there's a thing if there's a person
who's standing on a stage talking to an

270
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:59,120
audience about the world and it's a late
night talk show and I was always sort

271
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:02,600
of rebelling against that format and
trying to make it just a show that I would

272
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,230
want to watch.

273
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,790
Yeah.

274
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,960
Well I think you did a
good job at doing that.

275
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,550
Yeah.

276
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,840
When,

277
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,780
when a show is on a network,

278
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,700
there's always going to be like a bunch
of people that are also trying to change

279
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,201
the direction.

280
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:18,140
I'm it like you got your ideas and
then you got your producers ideas,

281
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,930
which ad hopefully to your ideas,

282
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,050
the director's ideas was added and then
you've got an executives and hey man,

283
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,120
I'll fucking kick cooks in the kitchen.

284
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,390
Yes,

285
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,051
you absolutely do.

286
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,020
And that coming from the world of
standup and also the world zoom,

287
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,730
I like the solo show
that got me the thing.

288
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,620
I,

289
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,460
I had friends helping me
and I had people help me.

290
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,271
But it was ultimately,

291
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:38,270
it was my words were the thing that
we're coming out of my mouth and my idea,

292
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,050
nobody,

293
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,681
people could say,

294
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:40,120
what should you,

295
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,581
you should do this.

296
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:40,911
And I'd be like,

297
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:41,061
oh,

298
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:41,870
I'll think about it.

299
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,710
But when you're in that,

300
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,750
in that meat grinder environment,

301
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:45,950
especially when it became daily,

302
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,340
there's so many people who are sort of
yelling things at you and at some point

303
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,671
you just,

304
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:50,270
for lack of,

305
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,750
you can't,

306
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,950
if you can't top their idea,

307
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:52,760
you sort of go,

308
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,570
I guess we'll do that.

309
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,350
You know?

310
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,920
Or,

311
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,880
or if somebody goes,

312
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,481
like,

313
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:56,991
I just told him,

314
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:57,510
I said this yesterday,

315
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,343
like somebody will be like,

316
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,641
Oh,

317
00:07:58,641 --> 00:07:58,970
you know what?

318
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,230
I was thinking we could do a cold open.

319
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,330
Well,

320
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,450
I don't really want to do a cold open
cause that's just not the kind of show I

321
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:02,870
want.

322
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,111
Well,

323
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:03,830
I think if we have,

324
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,670
we have a big guest on,

325
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,421
we'll do the cold open.

326
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:05,511
Well,

327
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:06,470
I don't really want to do that.

328
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:06,760
Well,

329
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,341
I asked the guests,

330
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,174
he wants to do it.

331
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:08,871
Okay,

332
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:09,710
I guess we'll do it.

333
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,390
And then the guest shows up and he goes,

334
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:11,990
we're doing this called over.

335
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,171
He's like,

336
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:12,741
I don't want to do it.

337
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:13,130
And you go,

338
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:13,251
oh,

339
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:16,370
but we already bought the whipped cream
and then suddenly had this vision of

340
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,120
like,

341
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,230
why are we doing this?

342
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,970
Why we are,

343
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,380
it's just there's this machine of
television and this machine that suddenly

344
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,660
you're just as you either.

345
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,973
I felt like I was,

346
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,770
it was like a meat grinder and either I
was putting the meat in the grinder or I

347
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:31,970
was the meat for the grinder.

348
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,230
And in that format,

349
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:33,891
when it was daily,

350
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,090
a lot of days I was the meat.
