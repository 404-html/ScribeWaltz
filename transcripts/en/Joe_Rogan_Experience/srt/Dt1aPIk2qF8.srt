1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,360
Then he realized that his friends were 
telling you stream just stopped our 

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,150
recording for some reason.
All right man.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,530
I'm probably the fucking man and now 
it's back on him man.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,050
Ladies Gentlemen.
Refresh your browsers.

5
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:14,220
People.
The man.

6
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:17,850
Apparently it was just fucking.
That's crazy.

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,140
Like it just went off air and then 
everything came back on by itself.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,200
Yeah,
he took it with his friends.

9
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:31,201
Does he want to be a Downer because 
they're all taking is you utopian story 

10
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:31,201
smokers.
I got fuck it.

11
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:31,980
But he didn't feel anything so like all 
right.

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,810
But then he didn't want to be the one 
left out so I was like,

13
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:34,770
fuck it.
I'll smoke with you guys.

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,630
He would pass it and he was like,
take some.

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,820
And then he realized he could for the 
first time,

16
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:43,821
like years and years could actually sit 
there with those legs and arms like 

17
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:43,821
cramping.
Got Sean Rouse.

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,950
Maybe it could help them.
I don't know that there's no way that 

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,950
guy does not smoke pot.
No,

20
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,710
no it doesn't.
That doesn't smoke weed.

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,270
You would think that doug would smoke 
weed.

22
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,080
Stan?
Hope does not.

23
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:56,470
Like we'd really.
He's done a few mushrooms,

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,130
Stan hope we did DMT.

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,620
He'll go to other dimensions like pop 
banks and paranoia and isn't like the 

26
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,130
negative side effects of everything for 
everybody.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,730
The paranoia that pot gives you is 
really.

28
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:15,390
It's almost like the opposite of alcohol
because alcohol makes you look through a

29
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,650
tube.
Alcohol.

30
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:18,450
You like looking at the world through A.
Yeah.

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,340
To seeing marijuana's the opposite.
Marijuana,

32
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:26,880
like your blinders.
I see it in front of me,

33
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,830
Brian.
It went off and on for a second.

34
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,900
It blipped today.
Just so you guys know.

35
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,160
It's not me.
Fucking it up.

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,210
Use Dreams just fucking operate.
If you can't see red band,

37
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,110
he's actually speaking into the 
computer.

38
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,370
You can't blame Brian.
Ladies and gentlemen,

39
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:46,371
don't be mean.
This is difficult to figure out the 

40
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:46,371
stupid shit out.
Ultimately,

41
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:48,480
I would love to have this on my website,
on Joe Rogan Dot Knapp,

42
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:50,880
but right now I don't think the 
technology's available.

43
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,430
It's not quite ready,
but this is ideally the best way to do a

44
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:55,140
show.
You know?

45
00:01:55,141 --> 00:02:00,141
This is way more fun and doing some some
show that's on television that nobody 

46
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:00,141
gives a shit about,
you know,

47
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,770
I mean this is what we can do.
Whatever the fuck we want.

48
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:04,530
You don't have to look at it.
I don't want anything from you.

49
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,030
No one's getting paid just for fun,
you know,

50
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,020
and you have interesting people over and
you talk and write.

51
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,830
How many times have you done,
what's the matter Brown girl blaming me,

52
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Brian,
Brian and the cone in and like a talk 

53
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:29,511
show and it's like you prepare for it.
It's like a big deal and then you sit 

54
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,260
down and talk to someone for like seven 
minutes and you're like,

55
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:33,840
I didn't even say anything.
Did we get to talk about anything?

56
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:36,810
I mean I had a few topics that kind of 
got out of the way a little bit,

57
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:39,980
but barely 70 thing.
And then in every one of those shows are

58
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:42,270
set up for that reason that it's just 
nothing.

59
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,550
You just leave there going,
I that was nothing.

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,380
Anything I didn't even know it was a 
great appearance.

61
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,430
Didn't say two words.
It's like if you're a Chelsea handler's 

62
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,721
show the those guys down there say like 
four or five words and then you're done 

63
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,830
and then they're done.
Yeah,

64
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,010
it's

65
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,940
real weird.
And people go,

66
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,570
Oh,
you're a great.

67
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:04,660
And that's what they want.
Short attention span,

68
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,380
Bang,
Bang.

69
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,900
See this guy real quick.
But I mean,

70
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,630
but that's,
that's the if you want to go for like,

71
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,790
if you want to go for like the APP,
you know,

72
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,980
just just a shot in the dark with 
people.

73
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:18,010
That's what you should give them.
You should give them the shortest,

74
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,260
quickest,
little things as fast as you can so they

75
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:23,100
don't lose interest.
What do you do?

76
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:26,350
You want the people that lose interest,
that easy to pay attention to,

77
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:30,230
you know,
know doing a numbers game because.

78
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,260
But then again,
I mean how many times have you seen a 

79
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,260
youtube clip and you start to open it 
up,

80
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,260
you and not enough minutes.
You're like,

81
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,531
fuck,
I don't even want to start over all 

82
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:42,730
those people,
but that's a youtube clip is totally 

83
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:42,730
different than something like this.

84
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,310
You know,
this is like cool because you can throw 

85
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,310
this on at work,
you know,

86
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,460
and you're doing some boring fucking 
thing at work.

87
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,520
You could throw this on and watch it 
while you do it and just enjoy a bunch 

88
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,060
of people hanging around talking.
I liked doing that.

89
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,160
I like watching fucking soldier.
Boy.

90
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,840
You know soulja boy.
Yeah.

91
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,640
I like watching him because he's having 
a good time.

92
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,310
I like locked in that girl on that 
train.

93
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:10,311
Do you see that video with the girl on 
the train singing harshly singing 

94
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:10,311
soldier boy at some old lady.

95
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,110
Just not.
That has nothing to do the story,

96
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,620
but they'll just say that.
That was a video that somebody put the,

97
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,650
the uh,
subtitles to understand what you just 

98
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,520
said.
I like watching that kid.

99
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,140
You know why?
Because he's,

100
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,200
he's like 19 years old.
He's worth some fucking insane amount 

101
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,951
of.
He's got diamonds all over his bias 

102
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:35,530
himself.
Tattooed his fucking face,

103
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,480
tattooed his neck,
his arms,

104
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,290
his chest,
everything.

105
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,440
And every video that I watched is 
talking shit.

106
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,220
Dancing and freestyle rapper,
talking about haters,

107
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,310
talking about other girls.
He's cluck and talking about how the 

108
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,310
money he had,
how much money he has and how pretty is.

109
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,980
I enjoy the fuck out of it.
I really do it.

110
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,460
It's entertaining as shit,
man.

111
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,490
I was sitting the type of program that 
would follow your brain so you can look 

112
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,760
at everything you searched in one.

113
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,910
That's next dude.
That's because we're the next twitter.

114
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:08,911
It just shows you like show people what 
you're thinking and watching where you 

115
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:08,911
could search.
Well,

116
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:13,570
I somehow went from IC.
I started looking up fights or something

117
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:18,571
on youtube and then I found that fight 
scene from the movie bodyguard from way 

118
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:22,681
back in the eighties and somehow my 
brain got from there to where I was 

119
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:26,281
watching a riding dirty.
The song all cut to star trek wrath of 

120
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Khan.
So it was all clinical con was riding 

121
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,860
dirty.
Know How my brain even.

122
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,220
How do you might want to watch this 
clip?

123
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,010
Some something.
Conan said something funny and Leno and 

124
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,010
then you cook that in.
Next thing you know,

125
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,281
I'm on soldier boy and you have a 
wonderful time to go on youtube rods and

126
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:52,331
I go on porn rides to where you start 
out normal and next thing you know it's 

127
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,820
big dicks and Asians.

128
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,650
Blowjobs yeah.
Real specific.

129
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,540
Yeah.
And then you're typing stuff.

130
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,550
That's what it's wrapped.
My first video you watched that night.

131
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,320
It's just to grow a big tits.
Blowing somebody.

132
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,490
Yeah.
That's Kinda hot.

133
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,540
And then how did I get to find funding?
Yeah,

134
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,140
that's really kind of one of the 
craziest things about porn on the 

135
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,871
Internet.
Like Mozart could just anybody from the 

136
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:19,871
computer directly goes to it.
There's no stopping it.

137
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:22,460
You can go right to a tick on an 
asshole.

138
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,340
You don't have to pay,
you don't have to subscribe.

139
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,760
And that's what they sensitize.
People do it so much there.

140
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,440
So they see girls are taken in the ass 
all the time.

141
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Well I saw one of the porn sites,
they had like a comments section 

142
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,330
underneath the thing.
So where people are complaining about,

143
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,540
Oh that girl looks speed on that girl.
And maybe because I'm older,

144
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,850
like whatever happened,
just being excited.

145
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,850
You were seeing porn.
Now you're.

146
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,570
No,
now they're so desensitized.

147
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,600
I'm going to judge that chick.
Can't always judges chicks.

148
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:57,761
These are professional hot chicks now.
I'm a judge.

149
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,110
Even back in the eighties,
I had my favorites.

150
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

151
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,360
Fuck.
Misty rain.

152
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,770
How can do professional porn anymore?
I have to have an amateur.

153
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:13,771
I have to have it on a cell phone.
I have to have it really happy to have 

154
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:15,460
it fake.
If I see a flash bulb go off in the room

155
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,010
like,
fuck,

156
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,120
this simulates you,
your field.

157
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,610
This is really two people like each 
other.

158
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Our coaches are having real sex because 
chicks just like looking at her watch 

159
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,120
porn site for people who like each 
other.

160
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,310
Just her pussy just beat the.
I don't want to.

161
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,510
There's that.
There's a whole genre of porn that's.

162
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,800
That keeps porn.
People like each other and it's not a.

163
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:46,810
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

164
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,470
We like that.
It's a little bit.

165
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,070
No,
girls will be fucked.

166
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,820
I just want to ask generally,
are they looking for.

167
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:59,821
You're not really.
I just want to know like it's real and

168
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,660
getting spit on and slapped in the face.
It's a lot of that man you like to do.

169
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,250
I'm like,
I don't like watching it.

170
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,080
I didn't expect them to tell the story 
please.

171
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,710
She's like,
hit me,

172
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,300
hit me.
And I was like,

173
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,130
all right,
and by the end I was fucking boom.

174
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:25,250
But the follow through on the backhand.
Awesome.

175
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,000
I bet you her face,
she took it.

176
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,200
I don't know.
She didn't believe.

177
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,930
Didn't open her up.
Oh my God.

178
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,940
What?
You even paranoid that I would think 

179
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:35,940
too,
that the girl would then go,

180
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,340
oh thanks.
Yeah,

181
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:40,330
this guy just knocked me around in.
You've got to think of a trip so crazy.

182
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:42,200
She wants you to beat her up.
She goes,

183
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,860
yeah.
And then what are you going to say?

184
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:46,420
She wanted it.
I mean,

185
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,210
I might also,
you should look at her ass fucking read.

186
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,850
Horrible,
terrible thing,

187
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,000
but.
So is pretending you've been raped.

188
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,980
I mean,
how many

189
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,980
people have heard stories?
Girl gets mad at a guy and just decides 

190
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:00,980
to tell people that he raped her.

191
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,810
I had a friend who worked,
worked,

192
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,150
he played for the Detroit lions when I 
was in Detroit,

193
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,760
and that happened to me.
It was the two girls back at his place,

194
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,030
Super Nice Guy.
The one girl jokingly said,

195
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,170
you know,
what we could do is we could say that 

196
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:17,170
you raped us and well,
how much money would we get?

197
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,030
And they were like,
she said it as a joke,

198
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,180
so immediately said,
let's go knock on his neighbor's door 

199
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,540
and said hey,
whatever.

200
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,690
Meet my two friends that.
So we'd have one other person to see 

201
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,680
their condition when they left.
So they couldn't that make up the story.

202
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,920
And I had another famous friend,
he would,

203
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,660
every time you hook up with a girl in 
the room,

204
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,120
he was like way famous.
He'd go to the front desk girl,

205
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,320
he'd walk out,
that girl,

206
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,330
whoever was there,
he would stop.

207
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,950
So talk to that person.
So there was one other person I'd see.

208
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,470
She didn't run out all disheveled,
like what just happened,

209
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,130
just as a backup because you were 
honest.

210
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:53,800
I just want to go to bed and be like,
see you later.

211
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,270
You know to a lot,
I mean to a lot of people,

212
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,300
people that are like famous,
some famous rockstar or something like 

213
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,430
that.
That person is there.

214
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,380
So unfair there situation.
It's so unfair how much more they have.

215
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,420
How much.
Yeah.

216
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,580
How much better their life is so unfair 
that people feel like you owe them 

217
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,750
something.
Like you've got an unfair amount so that

218
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:22,751
try to take from you.
So there's a lot of people that don't 

219
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:23,960
even feel bad about like fake lawsuits.
They don't even feel bad.

220
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,860
Yeah.
Chapter,

221
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,690
which man,
fuck the rich and you make that money.

222
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:34,691
If someone got fucked over,
run over my foot the other day,

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
play back the video.
He did get hit by the car and he was 

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,260
just trying to pop.
Razzies ran.

225
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:44,000
I was thinking of like have some kind of
thing.

226
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:48,410
We hit one button and you zap all the,
all the computers that are around you,

227
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,840
they have this

228
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,660
laparotomies.
It's the same thing.

229
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,490
They're just a bunch of people that are 
making a living,

230
00:10:55,491 --> 00:11:00,491
doing something negative and they don't 
need to do that sort of negative because

231
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:04,330
a lot of times they call those people 
and I'll be at the front,

232
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,860
the girl after them.
There's a lot of people that like it,

233
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,350
but when you're chasing someone,
someone's upset with you,

234
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:10,800
like they have their kids or something 
like,

235
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,130
like Dr drew,
but by the way we were talking about Dr.

236
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,750
Dre has stats on pause,
retarded,

237
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:16,970
but he's a really nice guy.
I've done is show,

238
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:17,750
uh,
the um,

239
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,760
the loveland show and he's,
I've met a bunch of times.

240
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:22,820
He's a really cool guy and he told me 
that he was in Hawaii and the,

241
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:23,440
uh,
the,

242
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,610
the fucking pop around taking pictures 
of his,

243
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,800
if his kids,
him and his kids.

244
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,730
Well it was worth something that they 
make money,

245
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:33,950
man.
If you get it like a juicy picture.

246
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,160
How about that picture of John Travolta,
kissing that dude's somebody got paid 

247
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,160
for that?
How bad was it?

248
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,150
I saw one of the lips.
I freeze frame kiss.

249
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,060
It'll never look like a casual.
It's awesome.

250
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:52,760
I love how John Travolta rocks a 
fabulous wig,

251
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,300
you know,
and just.

252
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Yeah man is some pictures.
He's balding and other fisheries is get 

253
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,340
the best head of hair ever.
Wow,

254
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,980
that's awesome.

255
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,460
The TMZ,
I saw one of the guys who works on Tmz 

256
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,221
and one of the guys so we saw so and so 
at the airport and I wanted to go up to 

257
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:11,881
them so bad with the camera and just 
sticking it in his face and ask some 

258
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:14,791
dumb questions and I probably could have
sold that back to Tom because I wanted 

259
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,250
to do as a sketch that will do it.
Just go fucking guy that does tmc.

260
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,450
Can he handle left 15 minutes show 
without taking a drink of water because 

261
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,150
he has like his sippy cup that there's 
no one that's watched.

262
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,170
It's evil because those guys are making 
fun of people that are on tv yet every 

263
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:31,710
one of them wants to be so

264
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,020
famous and is enjoying all the fame 
they're getting from being on the show.

265
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,310
But that's legitimate too,
because some people liked the way the 

266
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:41,960
bitchy,
like they wish they could be that bitchy

267
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,830
and they liked watching them.
It's like a form of energy.

268
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,910
A lot of what the Chelsea handler show 
is to shit on people where you wished we

269
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:47,860
could work with.
Yes.

270
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,380
Yeah,
yeah,

271
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,470
exactly.
Exactly.

272
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,270
But you know what,
there's a place for that too.

273
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,980
It's the same thing as like rich people 
that get upset at,

274
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:58,880
at poor people.
It's like people are not famous.

275
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,910
They like and pick out going after 
target woods,

276
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,640
you know,
go find him.

277
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,990
He's got a billion dollars.
Fuck him.

278
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,020
Like some woman actually said this on 
the Jimmy Kimmel show.

279
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,130
Uh,
she was uh,

280
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,730
running a website where people could 
find people's houses and,

281
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:11,270
or no,
no,

282
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:12,020
no,
it was um,

283
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,050
you would say where the celebrity is at 
any given moment and understand that 

284
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:20,270
there's like stockers and this can be 
dangerous.

285
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,230
And she goes,
well,

286
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:23,270
I'm,
I'm sure that their sleep well on,

287
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,040
on,
you know,

288
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,840
all their money,
like a bag full of money.

289
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,950
And it's was like,
really?

290
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,830
That's how I look at it.
Like if you're willing to put the Poles.

291
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,200
Yeah,
put people.

292
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,490
Especially young girls like,
you know,

293
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:37,100
some dudes get fucking really nutty 
about young girls.

294
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:40,370
Like they get crazy.
Like that one girl that got shot,

295
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,140
it was like when I first came to 
Hollywood,

296
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,350
some girl got shot.
It was on a of shocker even 

297
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,760
understanding how a black hair,
she was really pretty.

298
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,800
It was like a childhood,
not childhood star,

299
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:56,801
but like 22 year old.
She become famous when she was like 

300
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:57,770
young and some dude just got obsessed 
with her,

301
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,600
found out where she lived.
She opened the door,

302
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:00,500
he shot her in the chest.

303
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,030
How scary.
Like stock,

304
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:05,230
because out when I used to do radio in 
Detroit,

305
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,380
this girl within me,
15,

306
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,420
16 page letters,
not one piece of white left on the 

307
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,230
paper.
So it was written sideways anyway about.

308
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,740
I had fun going out with you looking for
houses.

309
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,420
Shit that never happened.
You know,

310
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,520
I heard about your secret messages that 
are not.

311
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,530
And then she went away and then she came
back and every time I'd be in Detroit 

312
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,170
she would leave these letters.
When your life's gone and it's just us 

313
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,300
and you know,
crazy stuff.

314
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:36,301
So I went to go get a restraining order 
against her because she was showing up 

315
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:38,730
at my shows and what we'll find out 
where I would be in the judge.

316
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:38,850
What

317
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,120
did you fuck her?
No,

318
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,910
no,
no,

319
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,140
no,
no,

320
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,700
no,
no,

321
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,100
no.
I just trying to think how far back was 

322
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,100
this.
Yeah.

323
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Yeah.
No was it

324
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,620
was uh,
it's been about 10,

325
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:57,590
15 years and the guy wouldn't.
The judge would not get what she wanted.

326
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,620
He wanted to hear her side of the story.
Now I had a stack of papers this big of 

327
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:07,580
her saying she came to the radio station
I worked at with some of my stuff.

328
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,790
She goes,
John Leftists.

329
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,200
It was an empty can of tuna fish.
Whoa.

330
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,640
Junk mail and baby shoes.
Then she got to your house.

331
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,420
Well,
no,

332
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:20,930
this was from her place I guess.
And then I had stacks of letters saying,

333
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:24,500
I hear the secret messages that you're 
giving me.

334
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,300
I will respond to them.
When you say this,

335
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:31,301
it means this.
But when you go to file a restraining 

336
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:31,301
order,
the judge,

337
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:34,940
you get less than a paragraph to write 
why you don't get the hand in any of the

338
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:36,790
psycho stuff.
So that.

339
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,810
And then he saw that and then the guy 
who did it for him,

340
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:40,940
he goes,
he's a dude,

341
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,630
he probably thinks you're a pussy that 
you can handle the.

342
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,070
Just know that because I'm a guy and I 
had this girl stocker.

343
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,260
The judge thinks that,
yeah,

344
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:51,350
it's like you're a pussy,
you're a guy.

345
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,620
Handled the girl.
Don't bring us involved.

346
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,750
It was his attitude.
So I,

347
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:57,080
I couldn't,
I couldn't find it.

348
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,060
It was the judge's attitude.
That's what the.

349
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:02,170
And you know that long ago,
that was before that checkup.

350
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,840
No,
this,

351
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,210
this.
I tried doing this.

352
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,670
I tried this a couple of years ago,
but it doesn't a year ago,

353
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:10,670
but it doesn't apply to California.
So I go through all this work,

354
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,580
get it done in Michigan.
They come out to California.

355
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,920
It doesn't mean anything.
You've got to refi one in California.

356
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,680
She,
she dropped flies in Texas to see you.

357
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Doesn't matter.
Now you have to file one a texting 

358
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,950
really,
and I'm a so I couldn't imagine you put 

359
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:25,950
this information on.
Yeah,

360
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:25,950
yeah.

361
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,660
Hey,
Brittany Murphy,

362
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:31,661
the actresses just died.
Her mom and her husband has been doing a

363
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:37,220
tour and all the talk shows and I got to
catch it today on the today show.

364
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,940
It's how fucked up your daughter just 
died and they're fucking,

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,820
they're just sitting there like for no 
reason not promoting anything.

366
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,900
We're trying to do anything but just 
like I've seen them on like four 

367
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,330
different talk shows in the last line.

368
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,410
It was weird,
but they do it for money and they do it 

369
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:54,410
just to like the people attention or 
whatever.

370
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:54,480
It's only about the daughter

371
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,600
versus like him coming up.
We have pretty Murphy's moment and 

372
00:16:59,600 --> 00:16:59,800
Brittany's Murphy Murphy's mom just 
sitting there and she knows the camera's

373
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:00,180
on.
She goes,

374
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,080
oh.

375
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,100
And it was,
oh no,

376
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,240
no,
no.

377
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,710
You find it on Youtube or Hulu or 
whatever.

378
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,820
And it is disturbing to watch.
Like it was so gross in a husband with.

379
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,360
So what was the accusation?
What does the sterile.

380
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,800
No.
Well what's the.

381
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,790
Isn't there like a current drugs,
but then they said,

382
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,480
but there just wasn't time

383
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,000
ids or something like that.

384
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,020
That was when she was yelling.
I don't think it was a weird situation 

385
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,020
at all.
Really.

386
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,090
It just came up.
She was showering is talking about 

387
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,090
heroin and other that

388
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,170
I still don't know yet,
but that's kind of weird that.

389
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Well it's kind of weird or what,
but it's the kind of with the husband 

390
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:44,620
did want an autopsy?

391
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,590
Yes.

392
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,270
And if a 30 year old person dies,
you want to know what the fuck happened?

393
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,220
I'm Jewish.
Other he doesn't look Jewish.

394
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,320
One,
it's against religion.

395
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,100
It's against your religion basically.
What happens if you murder a junior?

396
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,840
That's fucking crazy.
That makes it easy to murder.

397
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:04,260
You guys.

398
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,580
Synesthetic haven't thought this out to 
our bodies.

399
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,650
We can get them on your body's.
Yeah,

400
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,740
but you can't give you an autopsy,
but because I just read this poison 

401
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:25,101
that,
but now they're not going to know 

402
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,920
suicide naked.
Choke himself the last.

403
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,860
That's the story.
I'm sticking to it.

404
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,670
Yeah.
No autopsies.

405
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,650
I think there are certain.
Yeah.

406
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,910
Situations where they say if they're 
afraid,

407
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,670
it might be like a generative.
Is that a word?

408
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,060
Heart disease for like the kids should 
know that she got treated

409
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,620
or congenital congenital,
I don't know,

410
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,110
but they still offer that,
but not just randomly to figure out what

411
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:55,550
the cause of death is there.
Like he's dead.

412
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Anytime a young actress dies and there's
medication around automatically do it no

413
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:08,111
matter what.
Whenever somebody says don't waste the 

414
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:11,450
money,
commodities,

415
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,070
depressive,
change the topic.

416
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,320
Hey,
do you guys like cats?

417
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,260
What do you think about Oprah?
She's so generous.

418
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,800
No,
I'd have to go give a shit about me.

419
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,390
Somebody asked me for Paparazzi chasing 
me.

420
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,540
They would make $0 of my pictures.
There's no benefit and taking pictures 

421
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,011
of me.
You have to stay just under that level 

422
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:37,591
of fame.
You have to stay in the level of fame 

423
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:37,591
where nobody gives a fuck so you could 
still work and you know,

424
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,730
you don't have to worry about your bills
and you can go out to dinner,

425
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,160
but you don't want to

426
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,240
fucking crazy at the Vince Vaughn wild 
west comedy tour like premier and then 

427
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:48,410
there's a part like across the street at
some hip club,

428
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,430
whatever,
Hollywood.

429
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,700
And uh,
so we leave and all the popular out 

430
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:54,700
there waiting for Vince Vaughn and 
Justin Long and stuff.

431
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,380
I'm running these degenerates,
you're fucking piece of shit,

432
00:19:57,381 --> 00:20:02,381
you know,
it was like giving it to them and they 

433
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:02,381
were like,

434
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:02,381
Hey,
the guy from parks,

435
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:02,381
he goes,
oh,

436
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:03,790
hi.
Yeah.

437
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,120
No,

438
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,180
that's funny.
That's hilarious.

439
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,800
Yeah.
You know,

440
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,930
you can't go to places like,
you know,

441
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,480
who's the best sustained now?
That shit went in controversial life.

442
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,700
You consider them Mark Walberg.
Okay.

443
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,830
Was never on the tablets.
He's a giant movie star stars in 

444
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,910
gigantic blockbuster movies and yet he's
never in the tablets.

445
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,700
That's amazing.

446
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,760
You don't know who else and he never 
does interviews.

447
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,280
Nicholson.

448
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,910
Yeah,
just away from everything.

449
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:35,300
It's like,
well,

450
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,300
they would always catch him doing 
something creepy,

451
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,090
shirt off at some beaches looking legs,
bloated,

452
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,790
fucking scared.
He's,

453
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,180
he's still like in seventies,
rocking it with 20 year old checks.

454
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,070
It's awesome.
It's really crazy.

455
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,540
Nicholson.
Like he,

456
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,500
he'll like,
you know,

457
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,240
they did some interview with them real 
recently.

458
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:56,740
We were talking about the different 
dates.

459
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,800
He goes on and you know,
one night we'll go out with a woman 

460
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,290
that's in her sixties and nights,
nights and those are twenties.

461
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,240
Yeah.
You know,

462
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,030
I mean just,
you know,

463
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,040
I was,
he was talking about sexually who's 

464
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,040
talking about friends,
you know,

465
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,970
like the,
these acquaintances that he has a very 

466
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:13,970
varied life,
but you know,

467
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,690
you gotta appreciate that.
Yeah.

468
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,470
Dudes getting 20 year olds and he's 
fucking 70.

469
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,200
That's how bad ass he is.
That's pretty crazy,

470
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,240
right?
He's defined nature,

471
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,740
whether it's fame and with his ability 
to pretend

472
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,990
that overcomes the natural to pretend 
and jog and unnatural done with sex.

473
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,660
Like that's not.
Yeah.

474
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,500
Well a companion his age,
especially if there was

475
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,100
no viagra.
Yeah.

476
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,160
You know,
I mean if there's no Viagra that would 

477
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,130
take a lot of dudes out of the game.
It took a lot of dudes out of the game.

478
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:48,310
A lot of old rich dudes be like,
what's the fucking point?

479
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,960
You know,
but right now they can,

480
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:55,290
you know,
Brian Holtzman had to joke about that 

481
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:55,290
because know I looked at because now 
these young ones

482
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:00,210
of course have to fuck these old men.
And he goes and that is that sperm is 

483
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,310
like paint that's been in their basement
for like a year.

484
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:05,870
You know that paint work and it's not a 
fresh product.

485
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,930
Lead is hilarious.
It's not quite color picked out.

486
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,700
He's one of those.

487
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,530
There's a few dudes that over the course
of a month doing standup comedy that 

488
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,080
I've,
I've always gone,

489
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,860
how the fuck did that guy not make it?
He's one of them,

490
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:28,360
right?
Yeah.

491
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,530
He's so good.
So funny.

492
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,550
Brian Holtzman,
if you're ever at the comedy store in 

493
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:35,550
La,
that's where Brian were,

494
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,070
where it works out.
If you call the comedy store called the 

495
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,150
comedy store and asked when Brian Holtan
was going to be up,

496
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,820
especially if something goes down the 
news,

497
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,930
like I guarantee you he's got some fuck 
up five minutes on Haiti right now.

498
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,100
Oh No,
but you'll laugh at any way.

499
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:54,200
I had always heard about.
He did this thing on Oj,

500
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,240
but it was like amazing.

501
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,360
One time he tried to do it again and it 
wasn't quite as good as just an awesome 

502
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,181
set about that.
And then a nine slash 11 happened and 

503
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:05,950
Mitzi wouldn't put him on because we're 
close.

504
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,530
Happened to that were closed Tuesday,
Wednesday,

505
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:08,820
Thursday.
Just know.

506
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,220
And then we opened up Friday,
Saturday.

507
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,100
She knew that he would get up and talk 
about it.

508
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,010
So she made the talent coordinator call 
him and say,

509
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,080
listen,
we can't put you on.

510
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,410
I'm sorry,
but she doesn't want to.

511
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,090
He's one of those guys that would take 
the opinion most fucked up by default.

512
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,150
He would automatically like go after the
victims and

513
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,510
do wrong.
Why were you in that building?

514
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,710
What will you do with it?
Just like his take out of it will be so 

515
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:44,701
fucked up.
He went on Sunday though because open 

516
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:45,740
like an open night and uh,
he did about 50 to 55 minutes and it was

517
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,650
maybe one of the best I've ever seen.
Standup was there watching standup said,

518
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,300
I disagree with 95 percent of this,
but it's so fucking goddamn good because

519
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:54,860
he's so crazy.
His stance was fuck the cops.

520
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,360
It goes,
but they're not heroes now.

521
00:23:56,361 --> 00:24:01,361
Why?
Because it did the job one time because 

522
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:01,361
I wasn't on the belt.
People jumping out of a building.

523
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:04,520
I went to a fucking cop was below me.
Take him out to nine,

524
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,850
15,
whatever.

525
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,880
Everyone's like,
what are the crowds doing?

526
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,290
These sheets.
I don't remember.

527
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,020
Oh,
you remember when that shit drowned.

528
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:13,050
Her kids know.

529
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

530
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,700
Wholesome.
It goes on onstage like three days after

531
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,930
his kids.
He goes,

532
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,520
ladies and gentlemen,
I had those were bad kids or a day.

533
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:24,320
Never put the blocks away.
They sat that close to the TV.

534
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:27,290
They always in their fucking milk.
Those kids will not be missed.

535
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,140
I went,
oh my God,

536
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,570
it will all I like to say they were bad 
kids.

537
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,900
That's one of the most brutal and funny 
just people's brains and comedy is 

538
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,990
geared to like,
is it in my brain?

539
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:39,500
Just,
you know,

540
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,620
it's weird how you fall into whatever 
style of comedy.

541
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Like I would never even think about on 
things,

542
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,730
but meanwhile he's really friendly.
Like if you talked to him like offstage,

543
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,490
like he's not a dark guy at all.
He's very nice.

544
00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:00,550
He used to always go get me a coke when 
I was working the color Blue Coco 

545
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:00,860
classic from the back.
Go back,

546
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,030
go during a bug.

547
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,130
I'm going to start,
dude.

548
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,910
He's the faculty sometimes to Izzy goes 
off sometime.

549
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,590
I had to find out when he's playing and 
go perform.

550
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:12,970
Yeah,
and he was always so cool.

551
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,570
The fact that sometimes he was always 
such a nice guy.

552
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,220
There was one time when I got banned for
Pauli ban me for like a weekend.

553
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,350
Most of them was so,
so nice about it and what,

554
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,970
what said Damn me for a weekend for 
what?

555
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,100
I got mad at him because he got mad at 
him and dean tried to corner me about 

556
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,530
something and I told him he was a 
fucking idiot and that,

557
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,390
you know,
he doesn't appreciate the Comedians,

558
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:40,210
that I'm not working for him.
It's one right after,

559
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:41,600
uh,
the uh,

560
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,780
minding the store came out.
It was,

561
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,840
it was like he all of a sudden was 
running the comedy store.

562
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,370
It was all of a sudden,
you know,

563
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:51,430
it wasn't,
it wasn't like just a TV show anymore.

564
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,450
Now he was.
Because the comedy store we've always 

565
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:56,450
done for free,
you know,

566
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,520
I always,
not only did I worked there for free,

567
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,320
but I don't all the,
when they had,

568
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,350
when they were giving me checks,
they gave me like thousands of dollars 

569
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,350
with the checks.
I never cashed him because I always knew

570
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,330
that they were hurting for cash.
So when it came time to do their taxes,

571
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:11,320
I had a donate all that money back to 
them and I paid for the sound system.

572
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,470
I mean,
I treated that place like it was our 

573
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,470
place,
you know,

574
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:16,470
it was a place for comments.

575
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,450
The mix we're cutting out and that 
sounds it sounds like practically and 

576
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,421
Rogan bought.
It was like fuck it just we got to fix 

577
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:23,421
it.
Line

578
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:27,460
Shit.
I went and got the top of the line CD 

579
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,431
recorders so dudes could make some d's 
and I put it all in there out of my own 

580
00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:34,601
money because just for love of the club 
and then all of a sudden Paulie's 

581
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:34,601
runner.
I'm like,

582
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,190
Nah,
I ain't working for free for you.

583
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,270
You know,
I'll do it all for your mom.

584
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:42,740
But for you know,
that's who gets the store.

585
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,920
I think he won

586
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,710
for one.
I think his brother gave up.

587
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,790
That's what I heard.
Oh,

588
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,370
his brothers have all the years I've 
lived here.

589
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:52,540
I think I've been in there one time 
really?

590
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,280
I've been in that bar area just hanging.
I went with some comments,

591
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,980
but I don't think I've ever been on 
stage there.

592
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,740
Walked by yesterday and he was like,
I think I've been here four times and 

593
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,320
never.
Career has never really been forming in 

594
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:09,550
Los Angeles.
That's what,

595
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:14,551
that's what he was like.
I've seen you at the Improv and then I 

596
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:19,161
think I'm,
I think I'm banned from the laugh 

597
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:19,161
factory,
which I.

598
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:21,180
we're talking about guns and the dude 
who owns it to real pacifist.

599
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,580
And Jamie band you for talking about 
gun?

600
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,110
Yeah,
that I was on for the next week and then

601
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,450
I got called and said no,
you got called that.

602
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,720
It's a spot called whoever don't like.
So Tamara was so good.

603
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,480
Yeah,
no,

604
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,010
I got asked and then because you talk 
about guns,

605
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,280
not sage,
it was all staged conversation.

606
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,130
He's like,
Oh,

607
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,820
what you have gone to me and you want to
kill people?

608
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:45,750
I'm like,
no,

609
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:47,180
I enjoyed it.
You have gun?

610
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,900
Yeah,
I have.

611
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,510
I enjoy shooting them,
but if they came into my house then then

612
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,420
I killed him.
What's up?

613
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,430
Jb?
Quit worrying about what comics have in 

614
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:56,560
their house and introducing little kids 
and Michael Jackson,

615
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,440
so that's a way bigger problem.

616
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,210
Jamie.
Introducing these children that are on 

617
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,150
the make a wish foundation,
but it was a mega list or something like

618
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:13,550
that.
He was sick.

619
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,240
He was introducing them to Michael 
Jackson.

620
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,270
You're saying introducing.
I say pimping,

621
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,700
pimping his genius,
but he doesn't know what the fuck that 

622
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,521
ass I spoke.
I don't think that Michael Jackson fuck 

623
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:32,590
those kids because I think where are the
bodies there?

624
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,670
There'll be not just one kitty fucked.
He'd be fucking hundreds.

625
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,620
I think it's probably eight to 10.
I don't think he did.

626
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:44,630
I.
I think it's much more likely that we 

627
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,331
talked about this before.
I think it's much more likely that a 

628
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:50,930
WHO's just completely fucked up and I 
was molested when he was a kid and 

629
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,461
abused and he grew up in the public eye 
and he grew up as a baby and like being 

630
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,320
a drug user and just kind of had I 
believe in the power of huge rumors and 

631
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:03,750
I think,
what am I terrible in the ass.

632
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:08,751
Do you believe that one going through 
just because of that theory says other 

633
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,480
guest that Mikey from life,
Sarah,

634
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,120
because he saw him without his makeup 
kill.

635
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:20,350
Not little rumors tired because his that
lives down the block from.

636
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:24,560
You made that one.
I didn't even leave your fucking name,

637
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,830
but the rumor that moved rumor traveled 
the whole country.

638
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,440
That's a crazy rumor.
Kurt Metzger told me,

639
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:34,530
he asked a whatever kind of doctor that 
he goes,

640
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:39,531
there's never been any recorded 
documentation of any animal up someone's

641
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:42,300
blood,
but you know the Internet.

642
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,770
See asshole,
that guy's an idiot still at all.

643
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,590
Go to net nanny.
Like,

644
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,640
dude,
you're missing the good sites,

645
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:03,030
son.
You ain't never seen the eels come out.

646
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,720
That

647
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,490
really weird.
Kept coming out.

648
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,480
I kept thinking was the same one.
That octopus is up.

649
00:30:11,481 --> 00:30:16,481
They're assholes.
There's some shit going into people's 

650
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:16,850
bodies.
If you could think of it.

651
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,860
Did you see the video?
The dude who,

652
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:23,861
uh,
has been shooting silicone and is dip 

653
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:24,880
for six years.
How delicious.

654
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,400
It looks like someone,
some dude on twitter.

655
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:30,140
I don't remember your name.
I apologize.

656
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,030
Some dude on twitter said it looked like
a shaved dead rabbit.

657
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,690
I'll throw the link up for you guys

658
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,090
and um,
I will,

659
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:42,660
uh,
I'll,

660
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,010
uh,
we're going to watch it right now,

661
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:44,600
but I'll throw the link.

662
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:49,630
Gotcha.
You guys can see it show showing where 

663
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,171
they talk about Internet videos.
They played it and it couldn't show 

664
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:55,751
their video.
So they just showed the audience's 

665
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,791
reaction,
so they're all just sitting there so 

666
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:57,791
they,
all of them just bought faces.

667
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,150
That's funny.
Okay.

668
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,920
I can't find.
It must have been from a couple of days 

669
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,121
ago by tweet too much.
We're on two hours right now.

670
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,100
So what?
We're having a party here.

671
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,830
We're not really on two hours.
We didn't start on time.

672
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,060
It's only 4:00
right now.

673
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:18,120
Brian,
you fucking faker.

674
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,640
You're saying it like you counted the 
time.

675
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,720
We're on two hours.

676
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,160
Four or five.
And second.

677
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,420
That's about two hours.
You took a wild shot.

678
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,880
Completely accurate with the minutes.

679
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,270
Oh good.
I'm trying to find this dead rabbit.

680
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,340
Brian

681
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,900
text.
I renamed them.

682
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:42,901
It's techie now.
Tech one day and then I.

683
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,250
Yeah,
I agree with Rod.

684
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,820
I believe it,
but that's.

685
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:56,220
They always say don't focus on his name.
It was one day you don't.

686
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:02,470
You don't want to change the name of 
your cat has already destroyed a 

687
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,290
keyboard.
Keyboard.

688
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,220
He hates anything.
Technology.

689
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:05,650
Okay.
No.

690
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,880
He went up to my keyboard.
I started using my keyboard.

691
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,110
He like ran.
It was like,

692
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,500
what's that noise jumps up and starts 
taking his calls and ripping keys.

693
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,640
I'm like,
Ah,

694
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,240
if I get a,
use my camera and if I turn on a camera,

695
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:25,250
he sees the camera from across the room,
charges me and tries to grab the camera 

696
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,160
and like videos and considering giving 
it back to the outrageous.

697
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,340
He's a kitten.
That's what they do,

698
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,520
but it's just all terrain coordination.
Maybe that person was just like

699
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,870
killed,
but technology technology killed him.

700
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:37,670
So he's had.

701
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:43,540
There's a part of ghost dad to.
Maybe this is made out of technology.

702
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,300
Nice.
Normal Guy Haircut today.

703
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,390
Brian.
By the way,

704
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,070
this is the most normal dude I've ever 
seen.

705
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:54,520
Your hair.

706
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,770
All right.
Here's the.

707
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,860
I just put it up online.
I just put it up online so you guys are 

708
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,861
twittered it.
The address of the dude who was 

709
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:06,200
injecting silicone into his dick for six
years and we're going to watch it right 

710
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,771
now because it is that fucked up.
It is something to eat and I just 

711
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:09,990
clicked on it right now.
So it's loading up right now.

712
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:10,590
Check this shit out.

713
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,950
Music,
music,

714
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:27,810
music.

715
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:40,510
Feedback in the noise right there.
The worst.

716
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,890
When you have 27 tabs open up and you're
like,

717
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:53,790
that's so fucking annoying.
What is that?

718
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:59,410
To find it.
Let's see

719
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,830
where I'm wearing a little intention.
So that's all that.

720
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,400
Why would you want to look at this

721
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,260
to hold it?

722
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,570
Why would you want me to back it up?
Hold on.

723
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,630
Hello?
Would you like to name it though?

724
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,330
Oh,
it was real cocky.

725
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,930
It's funny.
We can't watch Hulu that.

726
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh my God,
he's been injecting silicone in it was 

727
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,220
dick or six years.
Can we get hard?

728
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,800
Is that all head on topic?
And then they look at it.

729
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,090
So that's all that is.

730
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,480
Hold it.
Should I continue?

731
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,920
Okay.
That's how we're.

732
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,620
Could it be he's injecting silicone into
his fucking.

733
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,410
I mean,
look at that.

734
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:57,310
That's insane.

735
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:04,510
Six years of injecting silicon of is six
years.

736
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,220
It's unlikely he's unable to have sex.
I see.

737
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,440
You really think I'd like to fuck his 
ass.

738
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:18,580
I was listening to pleasure.
The adventure and the experience that 

739
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:23,480
I've gotten from this way.
Way,

740
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:28,481
way better than whatever,
15 minutes of pleasure that I would 

741
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:33,791
guess what is,
what has he gotten experience in this 

742
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:38,770
deck and no longer stand up to pee 
because it would just kind of go 

743
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,000
everywhere,
you know,

744
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,120
it was difficult to control.
And so I started learning about,

745
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:47,121
okay,
I have to sit down and I'll tell you 

746
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:47,490
about some other adjustments in the 
second play of these adjustments.

747
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:52,491
So they just add to the excitement for 
me because it's just another reminder 

748
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:55,170
and it's part of the Odyssey of,
of all of this,

749
00:35:55,430 --> 00:36:00,430
you know,
so I was sitting down to pee for a long 

750
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:00,780
time.
Well then the size got to be that when I

751
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:03,360
would sit down,
I'd get wet.

752
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,480
It would get dumped into the water and 
toilets concluding my own.

753
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,220
And so I would have sort of squat over 
the ball.

754
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:15,700
You know,
I,

755
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:20,701
I think that just the fact that people 
look at me and either wonder what's 

756
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,890
going on,
what is that,

757
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,670
you know,
the basic questions that people ask,

758
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,680
can you still have an orgasm?
Things like that.

759
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,070
Uh,
I'm,

760
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,330
I'm getting people to think and I'm 
challenging their ideas of what a 

761
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,320
payments should look like,
um,

762
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,630
should,
uh,

763
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,720
function and so challenging.

764
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,070
Giving them a challenge to down the 
gauntlet bitch.

765
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,400
The crazy thing is attention.
No.

766
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,380
Would you like to name it though?
I mean,

767
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,370
this guy's like so happy to be pulling 
us deck,

768
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,160
looking at us,
touch it,

769
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,530
look at that.
Wasn't even really looking at a penis 

770
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,510
and what it really looks like.
Basketball,

771
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,200
the underwear I'm wearing,
he's challenging.

772
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:24,290
Your perceptions are what the fuck?
I'm getting tired.

773
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,940
I'm not.
He is that dude

774
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,320
there.
Other ways you can challenge people to 

775
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,711
think maybe you know,
what is that when dudes like tattooed 

776
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,750
their dicks and put barbells through 
what's going on there?

777
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,140
They just think presentation,
presentation on a silver platter with 

778
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:52,310
the birth parents that are into that.
Is there a little twitter poll?

779
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,790
How many girls are really into dudes 
with like tattoos and barbells and the 

780
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,090
same shit with girl.
Put that bar down there and their 

781
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,480
vaginas.
How smelly the barbell and the pussy 

782
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,640
makes me sad.
I don't really like it,

783
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:09,880
but I'm not against against.
There's.

784
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,030
Is there a single girl that ever has 
gotten a barbell and the slot?

785
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,210
Not Anything wrong with slots.
I don't say slot in a negative way.

786
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:23,211
I mean a girl that's down to party.
That's what I'll say that instead 

787
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:26,860
though.
I mean there's no proves that gives 

788
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:26,860
their cliff you,
you get your clip periods,

789
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,470
you're sending a message.

790
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,680
Yeah,
because you can't really do this and the

791
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:32,840
guy would go,
well you,

792
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,410
you're,
you can have a license.

793
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,590
Yeah.
You clearly did.

794
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:37,400
And the license plates.
So you had that.

795
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,640
That right there says you.
You're in.

796
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,820
You.
Do you feel like your vaginal be so 

797
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:44,820
public?
Yeah,

798
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,080
that you will set up a little bit.
Apparently someone that's from a 

799
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,081
documentary on Dick's,
the guy with the fucked up tick from a 

800
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,090
documentary.
That'd be a good one to watch.

801
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,340
Take Viagra and try to knock it on the 
rush and the entire time you're watching

802
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,250
movies that are like,
no,

803
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,190
no,
just punch himself.

804
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:09,270
Gave guys give guys like a really high 
dose of by Agora and they want me to 

805
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,080
watch gay porn and you had girls,
girls touching them.

806
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:23,131
They were allowed guys massaging your 
back.

807
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,680
They give you viagara and extra seat and
then see if you gave the first guy that 

808
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,270
you would definitely get art.
Know no question.

809
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:36,590
A suicide challenge match.
Yeah.

810
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,270
Yeah.
That would be a funny.

811
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,650
I mean we find some Israeli note.
There's no way them games.

812
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,300
You're going to get married.
I don't want that.

813
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,360
You know those that's not right.
Just take to have some guy just blowing 

814
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:54,430
in your ear and see what happens.
To have some really soft boys.

815
00:39:54,431 --> 00:39:56,440
Smells pretty.
Rubbing your back.

816
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,720
Slow.
Long coils and a feminine voice.

817
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Feminine starts getting hard.
Pretty bored.

818
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,650
That's hilarious.
Just whispering and you know,

819
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,080
truck drivers touching yourself.
Sore backs like,

820
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,920
Oh yeah,
right.

821
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,870
Caught it right there.
Okay,

822
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,960
we'll fix it.
We'll fix you up.

823
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:29,970
No worries.
I heard Bobby Kelly talking about this 

824
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:29,970
on Tuesday,
but like why?

825
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,690
That was even insult.
Why faggots even that,

826
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,010
like they've never done anything to me.
Why is that?

827
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,400
Like your technical amount,
I'll fight you to prove that I'm on.

828
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,920
I was like,
what is the difference for like,

829
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:43,921
yeah,
if you get the little thing with some 

830
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,301
guys touching me with whatever I don't 
like when people touch me because of 

831
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:48,700
dudes are thinking about fucking mean.
I know how I am.

832
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:53,701
When I think about fucking girls and I 
don't want anybody thinking about me 

833
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:53,701
like that.
They,

834
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,560
you know when,
if you want to fuck somebody like you,

835
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:55,990
you,
you're,

836
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,010
you know,
you're like,

837
00:40:57,011 --> 00:41:02,011
you're into them,
you're going after I'm doing that to 

838
00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:02,011
you.

839
00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:03,290
It doesn't want to listen to the fact 
that you're straight like,

840
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:04,210
hey,
I don't like that.

841
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,730
And then it keeps going after you.
That's like disturbing.

842
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

843
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:12,450
I mean,
the first time I've never tried to go 

844
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,030
after a check,
like the most clumsy and your history.

845
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,830
Could you imagine someone doing that to 
you?

846
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:19,831
A guy doing it to you,
like you're drunk and stupid and master 

847
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:23,600
that do do that to you.
You feel so uncomfortable and gross and 

848
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:23,780
negative.
Oh,

849
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,240
you're ranked.
Find Intelligence.

850
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:26,860
Always do that.
They will creep up.

851
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:29,830
Dudes.
Here we get aggressively homosexual.

852
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,750
When guys get trumped,
they get crazy.

853
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,320
If I was kissing another one of our 
friends,

854
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:33,700
he's like

855
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,390
kiss.
It was like calm down.

856
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,970
What was that guy's named Jason 
something or another.

857
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,460
He was lured flambeau.
Really?

858
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,560
Flamboyantly gay.
Any would get aggressive who's a content

859
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,790
and we were all in Montreal.
It was like four or five of us.

860
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:53,600
I don't remember who was talking to.
I think Bobby Slayton I think was one of

861
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,030
them,
but he came over and it was like the end

862
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:57,500
of the night and he was like,
you know,

863
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:59,630
I'm stuck in someone's dead because it's
going to be yours.

864
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,060
I'm like,
man,

865
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,970
get the fuck out of here.

866
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:06,970
I should find a gay dude for straight 
dudes.

867
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,890
I mean think about an artist for a 
straight guy to get laid and then 

868
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:12,890
thinking about how hard it is for a good
guy to get laid.

869
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,561
Like their numbers are low but such a 
higher percentage when you find the 

870
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,180
rumors.
Yeah.

871
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,450
If you go to like,
you know,

872
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,700
boys town or something to go to Santa 
Monica Boulevard.

873
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:23,780
Yeah.
You're going to get a lot there,

874
00:42:23,781 --> 00:42:27,290
but if you're in thousand oaks looking 
for gay sex,

875
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,890
that's tough actually.
You know,

876
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,230
you've got to find them.
You got to go there,

877
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,710
church,
got to do something.

878
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:38,850
You got to figure out how it was in the 
army.

879
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:39,120
And they're like

880
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:44,180
forties and fifties and sixties where 
people grew up in small towns had never 

881
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,151
seen.
They just thought they were weird 

882
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:49,321
because feelings,
but they didn't know the ones that grew 

883
00:42:49,321 --> 00:42:49,321
up in New York and La obviously they 
knew about gay so much.

884
00:42:49,321 --> 00:42:54,130
And then they go to the army and all of 
a sudden they find other gays and they 

885
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:54,130
find each other and say,
oh,

886
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,350
well,
that's like a real problem.

887
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:58,480
Especially in the navy when dudes were 
on boats,

888
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,650
there was a dude,
uh,

889
00:42:59,651 --> 00:43:00,070
that,
uh,

890
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,430
we knew that was going away to the navy.
His little brother was going away,

891
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,440
the navy,
we're all sitting around eating with 

892
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:08,440
them.
And I just,

893
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:08,440
as a joke,
I said,

894
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,400
man,
you need to learn some Jujitsu.

895
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:10,100
Uh,
so,

896
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:11,920
uh,
you could fight off the rape on the boat

897
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,240
race.
And he goes,

898
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:15,790
yeah man,
fucking fucked up man.

899
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,080
That shit happens.
I go,

900
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,980
what do you mean it happens?
Like that dude's really raped.

901
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:19,930
It was in the boats.
He goes,

902
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,130
well,
you know,

903
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:24,700
it's not that big a deal.
It's not that big a deal.

904
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,780
He goes,
well,

905
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,690
I've been in for a year.
I only know four dudes.

906
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,950
What?
You know for dudes who had been raped by

907
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:37,130
men and you've only been in the navy for
a fucking year,

908
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,620
could you imagine if you knew for 
Commerce to get raped?

909
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:44,850
He likes comedy.
If somebody started raping UFC 

910
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:51,170
commentators and I'm going to watch that
shit from my house,

911
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,010
fucking guns in my lap.
Fuck you.

912
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,180
What?
Are you crazy?

913
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,940
He was only in the navy a year with that
and it happened here or he during that 

914
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:04,860
year,
he knew.

915
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,170
Wow.
Four dudes who says,

916
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,840
wow.
I mean,

917
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:10,880
how many people was he coming in contact
with?

918
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,770
Even though the navy's gigantic.
That's,

919
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,700
that's a big number.
If it's a few thousand still.

920
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,290
Fuck.
You ever come close to join the military

921
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:19,760
or anything?

922
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,870
Yeah.
I had a a recruiter show up at the 

923
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:24,870
grocery store.
I work

924
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:25,460
that.
It was air force.

925
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,700
I thought of it,
went to my high school and then I 

926
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:30,700
remember him.
How old is that?

927
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:30,890
Like 17,
18,

928
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:31,980
and then when I

929
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,110
wrestled in high school,
then he lists,

930
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:35,010
recruit on,
forget,

931
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,980
saw our heavyweight and goes,
yeah,

932
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,960
as I'm looking for John have friend and 
then this guy started laughing.

933
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,020
He's like,
he's too small because when I was in 

934
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,020
high school I was going to be five slash
600.

935
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,640
I think I rustled the 105 pounds,
so I didn't grow until after like three 

936
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,570
years old.
I just want to fall in a real way.

937
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,170
What I wrestled.
I know,

938
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,550
right?
100,

939
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,900
five pounds of jail.
You're pretty small.

940
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,700
Yeah,
it's fuck John.

941
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:05,810
He on problems.
I would have to see the picture would 

942
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:10,100
have been.
Were you thinking about joining the 

943
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,100
military?
Same time.

944
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,100
17,
19 and it was kind of interesting.

945
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,260
Instead of college,
they're like,

946
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:10,670
fuck that shit.

947
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,570
Yeah.
I was going to go for college,

948
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:17,571
like in National Guard is like you can 
get some cones during a flood or 

949
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,810
something.
Really wonderful.

950
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,410
Do you remember the date that's the Bush
administration change all that bullshit.

951
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,690
The national guard used to be a safe way
to not go to war and you're helping 

952
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,280
people.
You're still in college of duty and they

953
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:35,450
split families up and it's rough.
We'll even look.

954
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,460
If you look at Rambo,
my bro was all national guard guys want 

955
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,171
to have to ramble.
The whole movie was making fun of these 

956
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:45,561
national guard guys like to do anything.
I got to get back to the store and now 

957
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,530
the national guard guys are as bad as 
soon as anyone else.

958
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,180
Dude I

959
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,560
digital with and he was in the army 
reserve for 20 years and 20 days left in

960
00:45:57,351 --> 00:45:59,030
his 20 year tour.

961
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,560
Twenty years,
20 days left.

962
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,680
They sent him to Iraq for a year and a 
half,

963
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,890
so if they start before the term was 
over,

964
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,410
just lock you in.
It doesn't matter and they can bring you

965
00:46:09,411 --> 00:46:14,411
back.
They can bring you back anytime they 

966
00:46:14,411 --> 00:46:14,411
want.
They recall you.

967
00:46:14,411 --> 00:46:16,170
They're hurting so bad nowadays.
I'm surprised they're not just like,

968
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,700
oh,
you're an eagle scout.

969
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:19,640
You got pop in Iraq.

970
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:27,050
A lot of dudes who go over there because
they think they're doing the right 

971
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,671
thing.
There's a lot of dudes like Pat Tillman 

972
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:29,671
due to join the army and joined the 
navy.

973
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:31,770
They think they're doing it to protect 
this great

974
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,970
countries.
Especially then in like 2001,

975
00:46:34,971 --> 00:46:36,260
2002 people who wants that.

976
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,030
Yeah.
And then realize you're getting fucked.

977
00:46:38,031 --> 00:46:41,350
And that's what happened with Pat 
Tillman mean he was a huge critic as was

978
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,720
his brother of,
of how fucked up things are over in Iraq

979
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:47,030
and Afghanistan and,
and you know,

980
00:46:47,031 --> 00:46:49,580
obviously wanting to kill him,
kill the friendly fire.

981
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:54,750
I remember a year ago I went and did a 
show and it got back to hoax tell and I 

982
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,590
googled oldest age and joined the army.
I was like,

983
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,340
I'm going to be old as fuck right now.
I bumped it up 42,

984
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:05,350
40 2:43,
but that's like 20 years longer than 

985
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,470
that.
Would you be listed there or no,

986
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,510
you do it and we'll start this officer 
corps or what was it?

987
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:10,540
A couple of things.
One,

988
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,580
they would say I joined it,
you know,

989
00:47:12,581 --> 00:47:16,300
40.
They give me a job that intake a 19 year

990
00:47:16,301 --> 00:47:19,650
old out of that job in the of that 19 
year old on this line.

991
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:24,360
So like the older guys is like.
But I know one of my wife's friends,

992
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:26,500
she's in a,
she's an airborne ranger.

993
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:29,080
She said she has privates in her thing 
that are like 30,

994
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,310
30,
eight years old.

995
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,000
Do you know just guys that are.

996
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:39,330
I have no fucking money and they don't 
have anything in their town and there's 

997
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,020
no option to do.
What's the difference?

998
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,410
He

999
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,820
for the rest of the major problem I'm 
talking about in general,

1000
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,290
it's like war for eight years,
dude.

1001
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,020
Yeah,
we've been at war for eight years.

1002
00:47:55,021 --> 00:48:00,021
Man,
I joined the military for the last 

1003
00:48:00,021 --> 00:48:00,021
decade.
Has Been No joke,

1004
00:48:00,021 --> 00:48:00,150
you know,
you know,

1005
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,440
it's just what the fuck man.
It's when I was a kid.

1006
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:09,650
Vietnam ended when I was a little boy 
and I remember thinking very clearly 

1007
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,930
that all this is a good thing because 
now there's not gonna be any more war to

1008
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,940
like obviously everybody hates war and 
you're never gonna go to war again and 

1009
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,430
then when I was like 21 was the first 
Gulf war,

1010
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,560
me and my buddy Jimmy did Telia we're 
sitting,

1011
00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:21,960
we had an apartment together and 
Waltham,

1012
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:26,961
Massachusetts.
It was ethnic guineas hanging out wall 

1013
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:32,350
and we're sitting in front of the TV and
the fucking the first trial to happen 

1014
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,290
and they showed the missiles coming in 
and bombs going off and I was like,

1015
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,500
Holy Shit.
And we,

1016
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,340
me and Jimmy wash it like we were 
watching a football game here.

1017
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,960
We're like,
dude,

1018
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:41,380
we're at war.
Shit.

1019
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:46,450
I remember being in college.
Then the two guys I lived with are all 

1020
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,770
reservists and then they got called up,
so they were probably 20,

1021
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:53,771
21 years old.
Twenty two got called up and went down 

1022
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:54,320
to.
They were going to start to help train.

1023
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,780
At the time everybody was like,
just give me a draft.

1024
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:01,810
There's gonna be a draft.
So we all thought because we were that 

1025
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:01,810
at that age we were 20,
21.

1026
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:02,420
We're like,
holy crap,

1027
00:49:02,421 --> 00:49:05,240
we're going.
There was a serious.

1028
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1029
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:11,980
So scary man.
I remember when the first Gulf War 

1030
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,311
happened,
we're practicing basketball and it was 

1031
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:18,131
the opening night of some play,
some high school player and somebody 

1032
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:18,131
came in and like the play bomb,
the plane,

1033
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:22,600
the plane's bond.
But I just learned to play bombed while 

1034
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,010
you're breaking up our practice for the.

1035
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:29,620
So I'm a little happy about it.
The whole thing.

1036
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,590
So surreal.
I got woken up,

1037
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,680
I don't remember who woke me up,
but somebody called me and told me that 

1038
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,210
Americans are Americans under attack and
I was like,

1039
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:46,211
why turn the news?
America is under attack and we just are 

1040
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:50,021
so removed from all this shit and it 
goes on and the rest of the world we are

1041
00:49:50,271 --> 00:49:55,271
so removed from what war really is.
Unless you've talked to someone who's 

1042
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:59,201
actually been over there and come back 
and they have a very different opinion 

1043
00:49:59,201 --> 00:50:01,691
of it,
but we're so fucking removed from it 

1044
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:01,691
over here.
When I saw that shit on tv,

1045
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:02,060
I was like,
what?

1046
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,110
Really?
Like,

1047
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:08,111
this isn't a movie.
It was like your heart starts beating 

1048
00:50:08,111 --> 00:50:10,691
faster.
It's like all of a sudden this team 

1049
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:10,691
you're on is under attack,
you know?

1050
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,750
I mean,
it's not you,

1051
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:16,751
but it's like we're all in this team 
together and then you don't think about 

1052
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:19,991
that three a day to day life.
You can say you're happy to be an 

1053
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:20,930
American shit and you believe in 
democracy and I'm Republican,

1054
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:26,140
but you don't really realize you're on 
some team until teams attack and then 

1055
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:31,541
you're like,
so that did nothing due to didn't know 

1056
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:34,751
these dudes came over and killed them.
Just because they were living on this 

1057
00:50:34,751 --> 00:50:38,610
spark.
They were living in this patch of dirt 

1058
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:38,610
so people were killing him.
That's it.

1059
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:43,240
I thought that was the only movie shit.
My brother's over there now is he just 

1060
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:43,520
got called up again.

1061
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,510
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1062
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,760
That's what happens when you,
when you go through a tour,

1063
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:53,910
if you sign up for the military,
Dick Cheney instituted some new 

1064
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:57,871
situation where they can just kind of 
keep bringing you back when they still 

1065
00:50:57,871 --> 00:51:01,471
an active reserve,
so he knows eventually got called up 

1066
00:51:01,471 --> 00:51:03,691
again,
but when they were in a situation where 

1067
00:51:03,691 --> 00:51:03,691
people floors and they were bringing 
them back.

1068
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,840
Yeah.
Ugh.

1069
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:11,010
Randall Masker,
how long are you going to ask the same 

1070
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:11,010
question over and over and over again.

1071
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,800
Some dude ask him a question over and 
over again.

1072
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:17,830
I've seen it 10 times more women by you 
reading it.

1073
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:23,170
Are we rewarding him?
So yeah,

1074
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:32,030
when people ignore you,
sometimes you ever make a joke like in 

1075
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,731
public and nobody laughs and then you 
hear somebody like make the same job 

1076
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:37,811
again because I assumed nobody heard 
them look at their response and fucking 

1077
00:51:37,811 --> 00:51:39,390
take that to me and they didn't find it 
funny.

1078
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,380
The worse,
and someone thinks you weren't listening

1079
00:51:41,381 --> 00:51:43,590
and they say it again.
What that means.

1080
00:51:43,591 --> 00:51:46,120
It's not in the moment trying to make 
this job.

1081
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,460
There's all the branches other than the 
army are overloaded.

1082
00:51:50,461 --> 00:51:53,670
Actually believed that.
Now,

1083
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,100
now I think he's probably telling the 
truth.

1084
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:59,430
I would think that in this economy I 
would say was a lot.

1085
00:51:59,431 --> 00:52:00,370
Yeah.
A lot of people.

1086
00:52:00,371 --> 00:52:01,780
It is a lot higher than

1087
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,410
look at what was it,
how long?

1088
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,820
Two years ago,
New Orleans,

1089
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:09,910
you know,
we didn't have enough people to send 

1090
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:09,910
their two years ago,
isn't it?

1091
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,410
Was that a lot more than two years ago?
When was Katrina?

1092
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:12,730
What year was that?

1093
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,090
I mean it wasn't longer

1094
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,880
because that was when I first heard 
about Kanye West.

1095
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:17,580
Hi.

1096
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,700
My favorite was Michael Myers.
Reaction because he's just a Hollywood 

1097
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,780
guy.
I do not want to be associated with.

1098
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,230
It was just so uncomfortable.
I know he.

1099
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:34,300
He got so.
I mean that was like one of the blackest

1100
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:38,890
dangerous things.
Like why am I in this picture?

1101
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,250
Bush is not like black people.
Judge hates black people.

1102
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,420
You say hates her.
Does not.

1103
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:45,710
Like George Bush.
Hates,

1104
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,280
hates,
hates black people.

1105
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,570
Yeah.
Why is that guy still on TV?

1106
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:58,270
Now?
He's on tv because he's a douchebag and 

1107
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:58,270
because people are looking for him to do
something wrong.

1108
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:01,550
His like his TV has evolved.
It used to be like,

1109
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,830
here's this young artist,
now it's like this guy is such a cock,

1110
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,890
like having close to the calcium was 
stupid and I hate them and it will get 

1111
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:14,311
you a million hits on Youtube.
When he took the microphone away from 

1112
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:14,760
that girl,
he'll be hated forever.

1113
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:19,910
You don't do that.
What was even worse with this fake 

1114
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,410
apology on Leno later trying to work up 
tears,

1115
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,350
but he couldn't quite do it.

1116
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:23,480
Oh,
he's so,

1117
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,520
so weak and it was just saying it's 
going to take a step back and he's not 

1118
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,000
going to work on some show.
He's got one.

1119
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:32,430
She just shut the fuck up.
The my favorite is when he says,

1120
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:34,830
just please just let me be great.
Just let me be great.

1121
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,180
George Bush doesn't care about black 
people's hair.

1122
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,450
That's what I thought it was.
Thank you.

1123
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,530
Aren't an adder boy.
Yeah.

1124
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,830
Hate is a strong word.
I hate my mic.

1125
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:47,360
Mike Myers.
Flinch at pA.

1126
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:50,250
little,
little,

1127
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,710
little dribble go.
This could ruin my career.

1128
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,320
What happened to that dude?
Mike Meyers.

1129
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:55,610
Yeah.

1130
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:59,980
They're actually making a new Austin 
powers movie.

1131
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,340
Awful.
That last movie was death scene up,

1132
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:08,350
put them in,
put them in and glorious bastards was 

1133
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:08,350
horrible.
It was so like,

1134
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,900
why is this?
Because it wasn't being funny.

1135
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:14,930
So then it's like,
why would you put clearly someone who's 

1136
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:17,060
known as a comedic actor?
He gave me the wrong way.

1137
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,380
You're doing the same movie,
but,

1138
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:26,230
but it's an Indian American Eczema.
It wasn't bad because it wasn't just 

1139
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:27,840
like a little bit like

1140
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,520
I never saw that.
It was a great movie two years ago.

1141
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:32,310
Uh,

1142
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,090
people are asking you to take us to take
a break.

1143
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:41,210
Why?
Because we'd been on straight for 

1144
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:41,210
awhile.
What does that mean?

1145
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,590
They can't leave the fucking screen 
breaks and I go to the bathroom when get

1146
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,250
up.
We're done.

1147
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:52,270
We're done at 4:30
and I have to do some sort of an 

1148
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:54,030
interview with some people in Australia 
for a Gig.

1149
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:59,031
I'm doing an Australia just a lot trying
to drop names and Australia checking it 

1150
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,030
into national style.
Like my boss,

1151
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:08,031
Soulja boy happened to that guy.
This is a knife guy.

1152
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,790
Oh No.
God.

1153
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,800
As famous as what's possible for him.
He was huge for someone just made a 

1154
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:20,130
reference.
Paul Hogan.

1155
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:21,500
Right.
Is that a guy,

1156
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:26,610
a family guy or sense?
It just made a reference about him 

1157
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,731
because I want to get hugely famous 
African crocodile hunter and that 

1158
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:28,970
knocked it up and.
Yeah.

1159
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,620
Yeah,
and then not famous at all like that.

1160
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,300
Yeah.
How weird is that?

1161
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:38,390
God was doing movies and shit.
There was millions and left Hollywood.

1162
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:44,340
We got sick of him as I think people 
just to crocodiles ids and then that 

1163
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,940
didn't try to like be in someone else's 
film.

1164
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:53,150
Yeah,
and we didn't see him in a romantic 

1165
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,570
comedy or crocodile guy.
Must've lost some money

1166
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,090
movie and said fuck him.

1167
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,820
Have you seen the preview for the new 
Mcgregor Mcgregor?

1168
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,090
But you may have a whole movie coming 
out and usually SNL macgyver,

1169
00:56:04,091 --> 00:56:09,091
but groover macgruber.
It's taken me on Saturday night live 

1170
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,380
making a movie and they get a new 
preview.

1171
00:56:11,381 --> 00:56:16,381
That's about that just came out and the 
funny thing about snl movies is that 

1172
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:17,260
they usually always have the best parts 
in the preview.

1173
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:20,290
There is not one part in this was fun.
It looks good.

1174
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:25,740
It's,
it's bad as the word when go to a 

1175
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:25,740
preview

1176
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:25,740
and you just sit there and go,
oh,

1177
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:30,720
what the fuck are they doing?
Like why would someone like promote 

1178
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,621
this?
There's nothing worse than bad comment 

1179
00:56:34,621 --> 00:56:36,901
because at least bad drum was hilarious.
Bad drama like showgirls or something 

1180
00:56:36,901 --> 00:56:38,200
like that.
Those are genuinely funny movies.

1181
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:41,800
You know,
I got some left behinds there,

1182
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:42,690
there.
The,

1183
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:43,570
the,
the uh,

1184
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:48,600
rapture videos that,
that fucking dude makes the shit.

1185
00:56:48,661 --> 00:56:50,920
Are they awesome?
They're so good.

1186
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,390
They're so beautifully stupid.
Why concur?

1187
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,500
Cameron get owned on Youtube is one of 
my favorite past times.

1188
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,190
He's so dumb.
I just thought.

1189
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,600
Did you really the one where he's on the
debate team.

1190
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,480
I don't remember what it was,
but it was like a group date of labor 

1191
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,500
and a few other people.
We got driven.

1192
00:57:09,501 --> 00:57:11,180
They're found.
I had her license.

1193
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:16,181
Yeah,
it was a debate and I remember the big 

1194
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:19,211
climax at the end was like,
because some teacher taught them in the 

1195
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:21,920
clear move to the rest of the movie that
he sounded like he was being real,

1196
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:24,050
but he really wasn't.
And then later was like,

1197
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:29,170
you serious about that?
It was Kirk Cameron loves the COC,

1198
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,990
a guarantee that he loves the cock.
There's no doubt about it.

1199
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:37,540
There's no way.
He's that crazy.

1200
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,390
Gung Ho Jesus.
The rapture,

1201
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,850
no sin,
no masturbation.

1202
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,330
Exhaust fucking gay as the day as you 
know,

1203
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:53,910
with every fiber of his being trying to 
stay on the straight and narrow and 

1204
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:59,130
liked girls.
And meanwhile he just wants to fucking 

1205
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,980
cock cock mouth.
Herschel Walker was talking about when 

1206
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,520
you were doing his fight.
Strikeforce.

1207
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,860
And he said he doesn't a master bath.
Yeah,

1208
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,900
but he's crazy.
Herschel Walker Scott like split 

1209
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,270
personality disorder.
He was hurt.

1210
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,290
He was trauma related.
I thought it was trauma related.

1211
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:19,030
He said his heisman trophy,
like he's got all these different.

1212
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,060
Think about how many times I got.
Must've had concussions.

1213
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,720
I don't know if he's a big guy though.
He plays football.

1214
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,790
Everybody gets concussions playing 
football right now,

1215
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,040
a quarterback who's had the most simple 
like ever,

1216
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:33,900
but that's coordinated.

1217
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:39,750
Blindside hits all the time.
She was standing there with my fucking 

1218
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,440
crushed them helmet the helmet.
But anytime you get hit,

1219
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:47,130
even if you're not getting a concussion,
it's a little bit of getting fucking 

1220
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,951
rattled.
Even if you get up and you get back up 

1221
00:58:49,951 --> 00:58:52,120
when you get smashed into by some giant 
dude who's a full clip,

1222
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:57,270
even if you don't go out and either if 
you don't have a concussion where like 

1223
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:57,270
your,
your pupils are dilated,

1224
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,840
you got some brain damage,
son,

1225
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:00,300
you just got jarred,
you know,

1226
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:01,660
that's,
that's reality.

1227
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,030
And when you do that shit over and over 
and over again,

1228
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,740
football is one of the most

1229
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,350
rothenberger last week and that would 
have been about this burger.

1230
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,990
Was there a big quarterback,
whoever it was like,

1231
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,400
oh,
Kurt Warner,

1232
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,740
who threw an interception of what's the 
neck tackle?

1233
00:59:15,741 --> 00:59:20,741
And then he just got blindsided.
You see them on the ground with the 

1234
00:59:20,741 --> 00:59:23,711
train is over him and he's like talking,
but you can clearly see he's not making 

1235
00:59:23,711 --> 00:59:23,711
any sense.
He was like,

1236
00:59:23,711 --> 00:59:23,711
no,
no,

1237
00:59:23,711 --> 00:59:24,900
I'm on the end.
You're like,

1238
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:27,710
that's nuts.

1239
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:33,010
That happens a lot.
Wonky caching once bought a a gang 

1240
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,970
banger.
He hit me in the back of the head.

1241
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,960
We were sparring in and I kind of went 
down,

1242
00:59:38,961 --> 00:59:41,060
but he said it was the slowest knockout 
ever.

1243
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,190
Like I went to one knee and he goes,
are you okay?

1244
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:43,690
And I was like,
yeah,

1245
00:59:43,691 --> 00:59:44,180
yeah,
I'm good.

1246
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,120
And then I went to the other night.
He's fine.

1247
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,140
I'm just kinda like,
literally,

1248
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:49,790
I'm just gonna I'm gonna lay here for a 
second.

1249
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:52,100
Do we have time if I could lay here?
That's what I'm saying to them.

1250
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,360
Long story short,
that a girlfriend I was dating at the 

1251
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:58,360
time came to my apartment,
goes,

1252
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,200
you bought a VCR and I go,
no,

1253
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,210
she goes to,
there's a best buy with a VCR thing over

1254
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:02,780
there.
Who's is it?

1255
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,760
Go over.
It's my signature,

1256
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,140
um,
bought.

1257
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:11,410
This is back when dvds though.
So like I even want the older VCR and I 

1258
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:14,600
bought it from the way home after I left
the place,

1259
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,190
I didn't realize bought it

1260
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,500
and then she goes,
what's the matter with you or whatever.

1261
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:19,100
And I go,
wow,

1262
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:20,780
spawn and die.
And then she's like,

1263
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:25,860
he looked and then we went to the uh,
doctors and then I lifted up a foot and 

1264
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,350
then the whole thing.
Yeah,

1265
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,460
that sounds like a state of when you 
wake up and someone's like,

1266
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,460
well,
there's no football players.

1267
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,420
They said data.
Remember,

1268
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:37,421
like trike would say he would play a 
whole corridor and didn't remember 

1269
01:00:37,421 --> 01:00:37,421
playing the whole

1270
01:00:37,421 --> 01:00:40,010
Joe Dirks fighter such fuck Patrick 
Kotsay.

1271
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,200
And it was an awesome fight.
Patch coats.

1272
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:47,201
I caught him with big shot Dirksen and 
Dirksen wind up taking his back and 

1273
01:00:47,201 --> 01:00:48,210
choking him out.
It was fucking chaos.

1274
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,030
Great fight.
And I ran into Dirksen after the fight.

1275
01:00:51,031 --> 01:00:52,500
We were on the way the press was like,
oh dude,

1276
01:00:52,501 --> 01:00:55,560
that was fucking awesome.
Find what a come from behind victory.

1277
01:00:55,561 --> 01:00:56,850
He goes,
I don't remember it.

1278
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:59,760
Know you don't remember.
What happened was,

1279
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:00,930
oh man,
he cracked me.

1280
01:01:00,931 --> 01:01:02,840
I don't remember what happened.
I didn't get this back,

1281
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:05,430
but this wasn't even an interview.
That was just me and him backstage.

1282
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:08,220
I got his back and you get the,
the Bj Penn.

1283
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,740
You hold the hook over the arm,
the arm,

1284
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:11,660
and he choked them out.
I go,

1285
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,510
it's beautiful,
man.

1286
01:01:12,511 --> 01:01:13,830
Wait till You see it.
he's got.

1287
01:01:13,831 --> 01:01:14,460
I don't remember it.

1288
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:16,270
Wow.

1289
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:20,900
Because I don't remember that number.
I thought it was a joke.

1290
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,120
He was like,
oh,

1291
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:22,820
I know.
I know.

1292
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:24,340
I know.
I don't remember this at all.

1293
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:26,870
Is that a good hole?
A miller against dan lozano.

1294
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:32,080
he got,
he got dropped and he will be thinking 

1295
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:32,080
how bad that we heard when you got to 
try because I got dropped.

1296
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,250
He didn't.
Oh wow.

1297
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,180
I did like,
his reaction was so real.

1298
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,430
Tim sylvia,
when he fought,

1299
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:40,530
um,
uh,

1300
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:42,550
what's his name?
randy coture.

1301
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:45,580
When tim silvia got cracked in the first
round,

1302
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,570
he woke up going into the fourth round.
He didn't know around was he thought the

1303
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:55,571
second one was the fourth round or we 
saw the fourth round was the second 

1304
01:01:55,571 --> 01:01:55,571
round.
Was off by three.

1305
01:01:55,571 --> 01:01:59,650
missed fifth.
I think it might've been the fifth 

1306
01:01:59,650 --> 01:01:59,650
because he told them like,
this is the last round.

1307
01:01:59,650 --> 01:01:59,830
I was like,
what the last round,

1308
01:01:59,831 --> 01:02:01,150
like he thought it was like the second 
round,

1309
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:04,660
like he was gone to race.
He was founded on autopilot.

1310
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:10,290
Just your body trying not to die.
Do you know just get rid of nerves is 

1311
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:14,230
just randomly scrolling.
Blasted.

1312
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:19,740
I love like striking training.
I love hitting the pad and hitting the 

1313
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,080
bag and sparring with somebody you can 
trust is fun.

1314
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,740
If you can find that guy that knows 70 
percent is 70 percent.

1315
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:29,920
You're 17 months you in the face 
recently in your car?

1316
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,570
Yeah,
same thing.

1317
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:33,130
That's why I like,
I like,

1318
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,180
I enjoy drinking.
Like you say we're doing literally I go,

1319
01:02:37,181 --> 01:02:39,610
let's go 40 percent because I got too 
much

1320
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,390
and if you got people don't know when 
you do like striking spawn,

1321
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:44,580
the whole deal is that you don't hit 
each other hard.

1322
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:46,800
You like,
you hit each other like a little bit but

1323
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:47,790
you don't try to knock it out.

1324
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:54,250
And so I'm like,
and my problem is is I don't get in 

1325
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,780
close enough.
So I told the guy let's go 40.

1326
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:57,680
That way if I do get drilled right in 
the face,

1327
01:02:57,681 --> 01:03:00,080
it's not going to,
so then I throw a kick,

1328
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:05,110
but I'm throwing a kick at 40 percent,
which means any little kid could grab 

1329
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:06,590
that kid.
It's not going fast,

1330
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,110
so he swoops it,
grabs it,

1331
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:14,170
and then blast hunches as as hard as he 
could after after catches my foot and 

1332
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:16,820
then I'm just laying there and I went,
yeah,

1333
01:03:16,821 --> 01:03:21,821
that's what I'm going to do more jujitsu
because the worst thing that's going to 

1334
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:22,010
happen to me,
if somebody is going to tap me out.

1335
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:26,500
I mean that could be that weird 
occasionally,

1336
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,060
but it's more of a not a gentleman's 
sport.

1337
01:03:29,061 --> 01:03:34,061
It's just a.
When the worst thing that's happened is 

1338
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:34,640
that I go like that and I'm not going,
man.

1339
01:03:34,641 --> 01:03:38,780
I already just weird playing where let's
slow down.

1340
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:43,820
Good guys don't hurt you.
Good guys are the least worried about 

1341
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:43,820
like,
well,

1342
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,280
the guy like eddie,
if he gets your arm,

1343
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:49,281
he's going to have full control.
He's not going to pull it back and snap 

1344
01:03:49,281 --> 01:03:49,281
it.
You got to worry about them.

1345
01:03:49,281 --> 01:03:51,780
Strong blue belts that are just startIng
to learn how to tap people.

1346
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,700
Those are the ones that you know or you 
know,

1347
01:03:54,701 --> 01:03:59,701
like just real hyper aggressive and they
don't know how to relax yet or it's 

1348
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:03,541
super powerful.
White belts who just learning moves the 

1349
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:03,830
most.
bruises all over your fucking

1350
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:09,350
bar.
Somebody especially like if I find a 

1351
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:09,400
place wherever I'm performing,
that's a better story

1352
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:14,510
for them is getting knocked out.
That comment that that's a Way better 

1353
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:18,081
story.
Then to tell what to work on getting 

1354
01:04:18,081 --> 01:04:18,081
inside.
Do you mind if I.

1355
01:04:18,081 --> 01:04:18,840
I'm going to Be some places that you go 
to or not.

1356
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:23,841
People don't try to do that at all.
Like when I went to a mall easton's 

1357
01:04:23,841 --> 01:04:25,980
place In boulder when I moved there and 
I started training their people couldn't

1358
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:26,940
have been nicer.
Yeah,

1359
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,310
everybody was cool.
There was no assholes.

1360
01:04:29,311 --> 01:04:31,530
There was no agro dues,
no one trying to tap,

1361
01:04:31,531 --> 01:04:32,730
you know,
one getting crazy.

1362
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:36,470
I mean they were trying to tap you,
but they weren't trying to rush.

1363
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,280
You know?
They were just rolling.

1364
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:41,700
It was all from how cool the 
instructors,

1365
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,810
the instructors.
Cool.

1366
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:47,820
That the people that quit like eddie so 
friendly and so relaxed and so cool to 

1367
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,800
everybody that everybody in the whole 
gym carries that friendly,

1368
01:04:49,801 --> 01:04:51,330
relaxed attitude.
You know,

1369
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:52,980
you go to like john jocks,
the same thing.

1370
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:57,180
John xoxo are real nice guy so everybody
there is nice but it was so hard to just

1371
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,490
start talking and you want to hit it and
then I was like,

1372
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,670
I wonder if people laugh.
They're gone.

1373
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:07,630
You got so hIgh.
I spent the first five minutes of class 

1374
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:08,310
talking about some history channel 
documentary on a ufo.

1375
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:11,460
The first five minutes they got 
scientists,

1376
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,060
man

1377
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:17,150
pulling up

1378
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,940
to channel.
Shit's going down.

1379
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,950
I'm like,
how high are you right now?

1380
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:29,450
How often do you do digital?
Once wants to one point five times a 

1381
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,920
week.
I mean even that,

1382
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:35,860
once you get your thinking about it,
I just get so mad at myself.

1383
01:05:35,861 --> 01:05:40,030
Like I'll go on stuff and then you come 
back and you just hope somebody gone.

1384
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:45,060
I used to remember sometHing I don't 
remember today and then try to hold the 

1385
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:47,100
water.
You've got to just be like ron,

1386
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,990
four weeks off,
and they tried to your act like,

1387
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,860
how does thIs go?
You don't even remember your bets.

1388
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,150
You have to review your recordings.
I forgot to shit.

1389
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:56,700
Then I took an extended period off and I
forgot to shit and I was like,

1390
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:58,930
well,
I can do something here.

1391
01:05:58,931 --> 01:06:01,540
I don't have any idea.
You forget a lot of shit.

1392
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:03,730
I forgot completely forgot how to do 
this.

1393
01:06:03,731 --> 01:06:05,200
This,
this move to break the arm bar.

1394
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:08,020
That was called the silverado.
It's my favorite move and I was a purple

1395
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:09,470
belt.
I completely forgot about it.

1396
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:11,650
Reviewing it the other night.
I'm like,

1397
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:13,870
oh yeah,
that's how it goes in.

1398
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,020
You know,
I,

1399
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:16,300
I,
I forgot how to do it,

1400
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:17,680
but it was like one of my favorite 
moves.

1401
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:19,980
It's weird.
Jujitsu.

1402
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,420
There's so many moves.
That's the crazy thing about it is

1403
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,950
it's different.
Do you think it's not matched right?

1404
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:28,320
You think a year from now some guy would
do.

1405
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:33,321
Something comes off a lot,
people are doing offers based on what 

1406
01:06:33,481 --> 01:06:38,481
you do,
but then no one has ever thought to 

1407
01:06:38,481 --> 01:06:38,481
defend this move yet because it hasn't 
been.

1408
01:06:38,481 --> 01:06:39,150
Once it does get invented,
then you've got to have a counter.

1409
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:44,190
There's this new move they're dudes have
been doing real recently called the 

1410
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:47,131
japanese necktie and it's just come out 
like I think it was the first person to 

1411
01:06:47,131 --> 01:06:48,750
do it and in the program,
yeah,

1412
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,710
it's japanese neck ties,
like a sort of like a darce,

1413
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,930
but you,
you,

1414
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:55,270
you grab it,
you grab it with a gable grip,

1415
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:58,690
but he turned the guy's head up towards 
his chest and you have your chest pinned

1416
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:00,370
on them.
It's fucking nasty.

1417
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,210
It's like,
how does no one know this before?

1418
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,680
We're in this position all the time.
They try to get the doors,

1419
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,660
cho,
but it really.

1420
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:09,290
There's,
there's an even better job.

1421
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:14,291
This right there.
So as soon as you lock up that gable 

1422
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:15,580
grip and you get on top of guy,
you tuck it under and you're bending his

1423
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:19,330
fucking neck towards his chest.
Your chest is on top of his head.

1424
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,340
He's got no air,
no blood.

1425
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,740
Whenever I do those drills and it's 
crying,

1426
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:28,780
oh,
I always pretend like we have an odd 

1427
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:28,780
number of people in the class.
I don't know.

1428
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,230
You shouldn't do it now.
Yeah,

1429
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,960
but you do it anyway.
You got to relax.

1430
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:33,610
Just let him,
let him yanked your neck around.

1431
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,790
It's such a small difference between 
fine and a serious pain.

1432
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:41,970
Yeah,
but you got to get used to that and no 

1433
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:41,970
one's going to hurt you doing that,
you know,

1434
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:42,920
but it's going to be uncomfortable.
But that,

1435
01:07:42,921 --> 01:07:44,860
that moves.
It's so important to learn how,

1436
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,880
where,
where it comes on because like the 

1437
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:49,880
japanese necktie comes on so quick

1438
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:49,920
peruvian guy to.
It's like,

1439
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:55,180
you're going like this and then you're 
just jumping back and hopefully you 

1440
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,040
don't go too far.
It's a spazzy move.

1441
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:01,320
Awesome.
Of peruvian necktie and japanese 

1442
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,591
necktie.
Both of them are the shit they fucked 

1443
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:04,591
you up,
man.

1444
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:07,740
That's a terrible position to be in.
I think the japanese neckties even mom 

1445
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:11,170
peruvians.
Pretty bad ass to the proven you've got 

1446
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:11,800
your weight on top of him.
Always the japanese necktie.

1447
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:13,980
You kinda like on the side and hooking 
it,

1448
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,040
but it doesn't it so good.

1449
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,900
Such a powerful move like that.
Oh,

1450
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:22,730
I think we're done.
Do you rebrand the japanese people?

1451
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:27,731
I'm like,
hAve I ever seen a japanese guy wearing 

1452
01:08:27,731 --> 01:08:29,060
it?
Well,

1453
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:31,850
what about that fucking japanese video 
gaMe?

1454
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:37,120
That video that you posted and we should
end with that because that is the most 

1455
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,360
bizarre fucking thing I think I've ever 
seen on the internet and sheets.

1456
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:43,580
There's some crazy japanese video game 
that's like these two musclebound gay 

1457
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:47,411
guys were in diapers and there there are
human bicycle and they're riding on the 

1458
01:08:47,411 --> 01:08:52,001
road and they're getting chased and I 
mean it is one of the weirDest things 

1459
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:55,820
and these Lead that lead the league in 
weirdness.

1460
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:58,460
So strange.
Do you know if people don't know?

1461
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,890
There's like you can go to vending 
machines in Japan.

1462
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:03,050
You can buy used panties.

1463
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:05,370
Like that's real.
Yeah.

1464
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,660
You go places.
They sell used panties going,

1465
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:13,690
wait,
why couldn't we up in one of those 

1466
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:15,250
there?
Because you have one out here and just 

1467
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:15,250
to do is get a girl.
Let's put it on real quick.

1468
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:18,860
Throw in a bag and I think you have to 
have enough people that you can.

1469
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,740
You'd have different levels.
One,

1470
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,590
the girl wears it all day.
That's the primo.

1471
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,830
She doesn't change her panties all day.
No shower in the morning.

1472
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,650
She goes to the gym.
I can you get those stinky,

1473
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:34,910
sweaty,
funky moose knuckle underwears.

1474
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,280
I think you've missed an opportunity for
the uh,

1475
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:42,281
and joe rogan a fanny pack.
I'm going to make a line and I was 

1476
01:09:42,281 --> 01:09:46,990
thinking about your fashion show.
I'm making fanny packs and then used 

1477
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:48,550
panties.
Rogaine.

1478
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,380
I mean you can probably get it.
So instead of expanding packets.

1479
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,550
Oh,
you weren't a role.

1480
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:54,170
I mean there's some huge.
Yeah,

1481
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:57,860
like goals and just sick.
I'm kidding about the fanny pack thing.

1482
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:02,890
You see me at the airport.
I always had one else thinks you should 

1483
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:02,890
shape a fanny pack.
Like a skull,

1484
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:05,030
like a three dimensional sculpture can 
get a little crazy with it.

1485
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:08,450
It doesn't.
It's overhead compartment for your junk,

1486
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,160
you know,
you're saying the sky's the limit.

1487
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:16,890
Really useful feedbacks.
THe shit got fighters entering.

1488
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:25,301
Would that be a little bit of a thing?
But you're sponsored by question and 

1489
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:26,540
after seeing the jew clam,
what's going to shock us?

1490
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:33,310
We're going to show you.
It's not as shocking as the jew by 

1491
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:34,520
everybody actually.
Funny.

1492
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:39,610
So ours clean your will.
Turn off the webcam now and check it 

1493
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:39,610
out.
Alright.

1494
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,200
Thank you very much ladies and gentleman

1495
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:45,470

I hope you enjoyed it.

1496
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,350
John heffron needs more twitter 
followers.

1497
01:10:48,351 --> 01:10:50,630
