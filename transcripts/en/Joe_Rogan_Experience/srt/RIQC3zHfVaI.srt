1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,730
And boom,
we're live.

2
00:00:01,731 --> 00:00:02,840
Before you take any,
uh,

3
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:04,980
Dr Gordon's advice,
I just want you to know folks.

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,650
He's scared of shrimp,
shellfish,

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,920
pork.
He's never had wild game and he refuses 

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,880
to eat outside of a very narrowed 
dietary discipline.

7
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,440
He's got like a very.
What is it?

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,500
You really do?
You really eat?

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,630
I don't eat pork.
You don't eat pork?

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,770
No pork.
That's.

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,390
But you know about Bacon,
right?

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,000
When was the last time you've had it in 
Turkey?

13
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:27,610
Bacon?
A day?

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,220
Yeah.
I had Turkey Bacon.

15
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:30,690
Absolutely.
That's just pathetic.

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
Turkey sausage.
Turkey sex with two condoms on a totally

17
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:35,530
unnecessary.
Well,

18
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,580
some of us don't even use that,
but how could you eat Turkey bacon and 

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,330
not eat the real Bacon Bacon?
I used to eat it,

20
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,900
but after getting sick and no one got 
sick ever in the history of the world 

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,630
from Bacon.
Do you eat bread?

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,360
Yes.
You have no problems with gluten?

23
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,400
Well,
I don't have a problem with gluten.

24
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:58,401
Okay.
There's a lot of people that do have a 

25
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:58,401
problem with gluten.
Well,

26
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:58,401
I have a problem with pig.
You don't have any problems with pig.

27
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:03,281
How sure are you?
My school doesn't look as good as it 

28
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:03,281
does when I'm not on it.
What are you doing?

29
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:05,160
Go look over your stool with a fine 
tooth comb.

30
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,460
Every morning.
We're here.

31
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:09,900
We're with

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,220
Dr.
Mark Gordon,

33
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:13,800
my good friend and his friend Andrew 
Marr,

34
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:18,801
who is what,
what is your position in the Warrior 

35
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:18,840
Angels Foundation?
I found it,

36
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,230
uh,
Joe,

37
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,830
uh,
so,

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,440
uh,
founder and former Greenberg and tell us

39
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:25,560
all about what it's about and what the 
mission is.

40
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,520
Yeah,
absolutely.

41
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:29,340
Um,
our mission is to get no cost,

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,490
a traumatic brain injury treatment to 
veterans who need it,

43
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:37,491
so it's an alternative means for to get 
guys treatment outside of the medical 

44
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:42,261
model,
which is predicated on a medication and 

45
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:46,101
psychotherapy,
which it does not improve quality of 

46
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:46,320
life.
Is that changing at all because of,

47
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,350
you know,
all the work that Dr Gordon has been 

48
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,871
doing and there's been a lot of.
I've heard outside of you even mention 

49
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:57,831
of your name,
people bring up your therapies and 

50
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:57,831
things that you've been promoting for 
several years.

51
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Has,
is that changing in the community at 

52
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,080
all?
We're working to change it actively,

53
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,080
so,
uh,

54
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,620
we're,
we're going to have a meeting next month

55
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:05,270
with some,
uh,

56
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,670
some top people and the active duty side
of the house.

57
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,670
We're also meeting with our and,
and works of getting with the Veterans 

58
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,730
Administration and working that.
So we're going,

59
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,380
they're going to know everything across 
the board about these protocols,

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,270
why they work,
why they're better,

61
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,610
how they're cost efficient,
how they're time efficient,

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,480
how this can not only improve as 
soldier's life,

63
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,540
but the life of the family child.
Second order effects go on and on and 

64
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,330
on.
So the evidence is out there,

65
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,180
the science is behind it.
This isn't false hope we're not offering

66
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,100
any false hope.
Everything is science,

67
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,190
evidence based,
uh,

68
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,230
reporting that we're doing and based off
Dr Gordon's clinical application of 

69
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,600
years and years of doing it.
So the short answer is yes,

70
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:53,601
they're hearing about it and we have a 
five year plan to overtake the system 

71
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:55,530
and have them implement these on both 
sides of the house.

72
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,490
So to speak.
Now,

73
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:59,190
for people who haven't heard any of our 
podcasts before,

74
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,220
haven't heard your discussion

75
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,730
about it.
The one of the biggest issues that we're

76
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:08,560
experiencing with soldiers coming back 
from Afghanistan and Iraq is if you hear

77
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:13,561
my voice,
I've got a little bit of a cold ladies 

78
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:13,960
and gentlemen,
a traumatic brain injury elk a lot.

79
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,180
How dare you,
it's big bacon,

80
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,640
Bacon,
and a clam.

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Um,
a lot of soldiers are coming back from 

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,260
these,
these wars with injuries that may have 

83
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,891
been fatal in the past.
They're no longer because of all these 

84
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:34,450
advancements in medical technology,
but they're still still dealing with the

85
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:37,330
ongoing effects of the war,
the traumatic brain injury.

86
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,780
Now,
what you have found and many others have

87
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,870
supported this,
is that a lot of this is there's damage 

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,690
to the pituitary gland.
It stops the production of hormones.

89
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,840
This leads to deep depression and leads 
to some pretty significant issues that 

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,681
soldiers are facing.
So if you could just fill people in on 

91
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:55,681
that.

92
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:55,830
Well,
what we found is that,

93
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,890
um,
because of the body armor being so 

94
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,500
efficient,
a lot of the blast damage,

95
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:06,501
instead of killing someone is leaving 
them with trauma to the brain in any 

96
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,340
form of trauma to the brain,
whether or not it's a blast trauma being

97
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:09,720
hit on the head,
slip and fall,

98
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:14,721
a automobile accident,
turning upside down or whatever the 

99
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:14,880
situation might be.
A,

100
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,910
the brain changes its chemistry because 
of inflammation and that's from tearing 

101
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,441
of little nerves.
It's not only the pituitary and that's 

102
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:26,220
been some of the problem that we've had 
is focusing as I focus on narrow kind of

103
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:29,070
diet,
focusing in on just the pituitary,

104
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:34,071
but what we found is a group of 
chemistry in the brain called neuro 

105
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:38,030
steroids,
which regulate our personality in some 

106
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,460
of those neuro steroids have names like 
to stasia drone or dihydrotestosterone,

107
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,140
estrogen,
pregnenolone and the literature has been

108
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:47,670
around since about 1986 showing that 
these regulate our brain function.

109
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,590
So head trauma of any sort can cause it 
to decrease number one.

110
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,530
Number two,
with any form of damage to the brain,

111
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:59,120
you get inflammation and that 
inflammation expands.

112
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,130
Let's say if there was a small area of 
tear in the brain or a bullet that 

113
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,010
penetrate a penetrating injury to the 
head,

114
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,440
that area where the bullet or the 
foreign object a diminished amount of 

115
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:13,710
brain tissue,
it grows larger because of inflammation.

116
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,980
It destroys more and more neurons in the
more cells in the brain that are called 

117
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,331
neurons are destroyed.
The greater the onset of cognitive 

118
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:27,620
impairment,
your ability to use your brain in a 

119
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,320
function and then emotionality changes.

120
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,620
No.
How did you get involved in this and how

121
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:35,621
did you figure out what so many people 
hadn't figured out what this the with 

122
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:37,520
the emphasis on therapy and pain 
medication,

123
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:39,480
antidepressants.
How did you see through that?

124
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:39,530
Yeah.

125
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,000
Well,
I really didn't discover anything.

126
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,680
All I did was in reading the literature,
as much as I read it,

127
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,750
saw that people had already laid the 
pathway for me to follow and I've 

128
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,210
followed it intensely for the past 21 
years doing endocrinology in the past 10

129
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:56,490
years doing specifically 
neuroendocrinology,

130
00:05:56,491 --> 00:06:00,740
which deals the brain and it's in my 
population of patients.

131
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:05,741
I used to see them for hormone 
deficiency and then started going back 

132
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,800
asking them those were the hormone 
deficiency,

133
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,150
if they've had any kind of head trauma 
in the first book that I wrote,

134
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,180
which had the first introduction for me 
to write about traumatic brain injury 

135
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,780
and hormone deficiency was the young kid
by the name Michael,

136
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:20,660
who had been in a um,
who had come to me.

137
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:23,610
His parents brought him in and he had 
hormone deficiency and we correct it,

138
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:26,030
is personality,
improved his quality of life,

139
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:31,031
improve,
and then read an article which I've 

140
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:33,940
shared with you in the past which came 
out of a Turkey about pugilists who had 

141
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,640
the specific growth hormone deficiency.

142
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,230
And that was my epiphany article where I
started looking further and further into

143
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,180
literature and Moo,
moo tie.

144
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,690
They had a hormone deficiency and then 
boom,

145
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,660
all the hormone deficiencies.
So this kid,

146
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,900
I went back to him and said,
have you ever had any trauma of any 

147
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:52,900
kind?
He said,

148
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,390
well,
when he was 17,

149
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:57,320
he was 21 at the time when he was 17.
He was in a motorcycle accident,

150
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,430
was in a coma for three days,
came out of the coma,

151
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:01,460
and his neurologist said,
oh,

152
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,830
you'll be fine.
He progressively got worse.

153
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,420
So that set the stage for me to start 
looking at this relationship between any

154
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,750
kind of head trauma.
And then 2007.

155
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,930
Uh,
my first military was a green baret.

156
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,450
I met the wife who was a emergency room 
doc in North Carolina and she called me 

157
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,250
and told me about her husband who was 
six towards the duty was having some 

158
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:27,250
problems.

159
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,110
We ran.
We donated the money for him to get the 

160
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,751
full testing and turn out who's hormone 
deficient when we correct it is 

161
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:35,160
hormones.
He was back in the good.

162
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,330
A good light with the military was 
getting ready to get kicked out for 

163
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,290
insubordination.
And that progressed on 2009,

164
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,340
uh,
with opening up our practice to 

165
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,320
military.
And it just kept on repeating itself the

166
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:50,860
same pattern,
the same head trauma blast,

167
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:55,400
a blast injury and hormone deficiency.
And now,

168
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:58,970
how's this being received?
Like the rest of the medical community?

169
00:07:58,971 --> 00:07:59,840
Because,
well,

170
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,670
this is an uphill battle because the way
it's being treated presently,

171
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,390
um,
if you look at the literature from 2012,

172
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:12,530
410,000
service servicemen came back as veterans

173
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,800
and,
um,

174
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,890
were diagnosed with ptsd.
Now a posttraumatic stress disorder is 

175
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:24,251
usually perceived as being a 
psychological psychologically 

176
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:27,380
precipitated event where they witnessed 
something that was horrifying to them,

177
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,100
a death of a friend,
loss of a limb or whatever the situation

178
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,460
might have been to stimulate it.

179
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,300
And that immediately opened him up to 
simple treatment here,

180
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,100
take this packet of antidepressants and 
you'll get better.

181
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,120
Well,
they didn't get better,

182
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,660
so they didn't get better because they 
were having what's called treatment 

183
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,511
resistant depression,
which now we find is due to hormonal 

184
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:50,840
deficiency.
If you look at the civilian population,

185
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,040
people with hormone to,
with treatment resistant depression,

186
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,040
you check them out and the testosterone 
deficient or estrogen overdose,

187
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,870
or low progesterone or low pregnenolone,
other chemicals that are in our brain.

188
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,550
And,
um,

189
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,230
these individuals have been the,
um,

190
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,620
the foundation of what I do in trying to
find a simple way to replenish them.

191
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,920
What you have to do is test them and 
that's not being done.

192
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,950
It's so much easier just to hand a 
packet and say you have ptsd when the 

193
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,980
majority of them are traumatic brain 
injury,

194
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,520
and I was on Dr drew show with one of 
our patients who was a army corpsman and

195
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:35,910
he didn't have a single scratch on his 
body,

196
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,450
but within two years of leaving a 
separating from the service,

197
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:42,300
he started developing depression,
mood swings,

198
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:43,590
explosive personality.

199
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,980
He ends up coming into our program and 
we find out he has two and a half 

200
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,660
hormone deficiencies and the pattern is 
indicative of having had head trauma.

201
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Well turned out he would walk behind 
Abramson tanks as they were just 

202
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
charging their shells and he said,
man,

203
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:00,960
my body would shut her,
and he was around javelin missiles.

204
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:05,961
He was around repetitive gunfire.
He personally didn't have a scratch on 

205
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:06,870
him.
That's incredible that just the recoil,

206
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,140
just a boom,
Christa,

207
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,190
the sonic boom,
the impact that that,

208
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,210
you know,
shocking.

209
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,700
His body can do that too,
right?

210
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,250
There are books out and the government 
has lots of books out on blast trauma.

211
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,620
In fact,
one of the amazing things for me to have

212
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:24,621
read was the army did a study on 
individuals who had had blast damage,

213
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,790
blast trauma,
no physical Amma just blast,

214
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:34,791
and they put them on a simple product 
called NSC assisting Nac and those that 

215
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:39,171
were on it got better,
but how come we're not hearing about 

216
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,330
what is that stuff in a sealed system?
It's a precursor to glutathione,

217
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,330
which is the number one 
anti-inflammatory,

218
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,330
excuse me,
anti free radical,

219
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,480
a antioxidant system in our brain and 
it's a becomes deficient.

220
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,600
It's indogenous within our system of 
glutathione is the same stuff that you.

221
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,830
You recommend taking booze it well,
yet glutathione helps with metabolism in

222
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:03,500
the liver to detoxify.
Okay.

223
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,700
Here's the thing about Nac though also 
that mark told me and I'm on that 

224
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,490
product,
but if if I was be a.

225
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,520
If I was taking that while I was still 
operating and the problems that I had 

226
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,091
never would have happened,
they would have cut it off so we can 

227
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,480
essentially cut off these problems just 
by being proactive and preventative in 

228
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,161
this way.
So if we were right now today to 

229
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:26,620
administer to all special operations 
soldiers in AC,

230
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,780
a lot of the problems that we're having 
out the window,

231
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,340
that's crazy.
That's crazy,

232
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:32,720
right?
It's true medicine,

233
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,870
you know,
what's going on is all,

234
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,920
you know,
trying to catch up,

235
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,550
always trying to catch up with what we 
do is proactive.

236
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,580
We see patterns in the blood that if we 
let them keep on sliding until they're 

237
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:49,370
sick,
they'll get even,

238
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,560
you know,
absolutely sick in the medical model 

239
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:54,560
right now is right this second.
You're

240
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,070
not sick.
Let's wait until you get sick before we 

241
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,931
do something.
One of the more shocking things in 

242
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,380
working with the UFC is we got involved 
with.

243
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,330
We do these events called fight for the 
troops.

244
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,310
We do them on basis.
And uh,

245
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,480
we uh,
we got involved with the intrepid 

246
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,180
foundation for Intrepid Foundation for 
excellent.

247
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,660
You find out how,
how little money the government gives 

248
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,660
them and how much they have to raise 
outside and,

249
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:26,661
and,
and doing functions like these big UFC 

250
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:29,971
events.
And that to me was one of the most 

251
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:30,370
disturbing things about those events.
I'm like,

252
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,430
how is it possible that we can have all 
this money for all these different 

253
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,331
missions,
all this money for all these different 

254
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:41,071
things,
but we don't have money to take care of 

255
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:41,071
these guys when they come back home.
That seems.

256
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:44,290
That seems criminal.
Well in unethical.

257
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,670
Yeah,
at a minimum,

258
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,550
at a minimum.
What is the highest level?

259
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,550
I mean this is if you,
if,

260
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,630
if you count on soldiers to do what you 
ask of them and put their body on the 

261
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:03,961
line to,
to complete missions and then you don't 

262
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:04,510
take take care of them when they come 
back.

263
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,060
How do you ever expect anybody to be 
patriotic?

264
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,720
Well,
here's the thing,

265
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,030
Joe,
like there was millions of dollars spent

266
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:15,031
on me personally on my training and then
you can't put a number on that 

267
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:15,031
experience,
right?

268
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:17,770
So to,
to produce a special operations soldier,

269
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,160
millions of dollars.
So it makes sense to put in proper 

270
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,850
preventative programs to make sure those
guys are forming,

271
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,410
performing at elite levels.
Right?

272
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:28,840
We're going to do that for our weapons 
systems.

273
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,270
We're going to do that for our vehicles,
for aircraft.

274
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,210
Why would we not do that for the same 
thing as our guys,

275
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,450
but you know what,
we're not waiting for anybody else to 

276
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:39,450
come up and say,
okay,

277
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:39,450
we're going to do this.
We,

278
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,621
uh,
I'm following Dr Gordon's lead started 

279
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:43,621
the foundation and we're doing it and 
uh,

280
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:44,560
we're gonna we're changing it from the 
inside out,

281
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,540
from top to bottom,
bottom to top.

282
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,100
Well,
I think maybe it takes guys like you 

283
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,680
that are on the inside to do that.
I feel like the bureaucrats,

284
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:57,681
the people that are in the air 
conditioned offices that are deciding 

285
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:58,590
where money goes,
if they don't,

286
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,750
they don't have a stake in it.

287
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,930
They're disconnected.
They're disconnected.

288
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,990
So they don't,
they don't feel it and they don't 

289
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:07,990
understand it,
but it,

290
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,191
it's,
it's simple because we're providing 

291
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:11,191
science,
evidence based solutions,

292
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:11,780
not,
not bitching.

293
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,620
Are Griping,
complaining,

294
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,950
offering solutions based on science.
And how long have you been involved in 

295
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,550
with this foundation?
Uh,

296
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,000
we started January one of this year.
Yep.

297
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,090
So just taking off just get.
Yeah,

298
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,430
I was just medically retired and in 
June,

299
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,810
so I started up.
I was actually,

300
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:32,170
I had to go outside of the military 
medical system to get alternative 

301
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,980
treatment,
alternative being not medication,

302
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,100
not psychotherapy and medication.
Very similar to when magazine was on 

303
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,100
here,
the navy seal.

304
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,790
I was on 13 different meds and for you 
know,

305
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,130
it,
you're just,

306
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:48,131
you're,
you're not the person that you used to 

307
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:48,131
be,
you know,

308
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:50,921
I was uh,
on elite up capable of performing at an 

309
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:53,450
elite level in situations of life,
death consistently and reliably.

310
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,890
And then all of sudden I have a problem,
you know,

311
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,830
handling things that just don't add up.
You know,

312
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:04,970
your behavior is not right.
I can't remember things driving home,

313
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,740
I don't know where I'm at.
Five years,

314
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,420
I've driven that route every day.
All of a sudden they look up,

315
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:11,350
you don't know where you're at.
Writing a sentence in the middle,

316
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,290
in the middle of it.
I can't,

317
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,090
I don't know what I'm writing about,
you know what I mean?

318
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:19,091
So those kinds of things.
So it was easy for me to put my hand up 

319
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:19,091
and say,
Hey,

320
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:19,220
this is,
this is psalms going on here,

321
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,620
this is not right.
And that was basically saying,

322
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,310
Hey,
I'm on fire,

323
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:25,630
somebody has put this fire out and this 
kept throwing medication and medication,

324
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,670
medication,
and then you start having anxiety 

325
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:30,670
attacks,
which was completely foreign to me.

326
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,110
Right.
That was something that some other 

327
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,110
person a week person's problem as I 
perceived it.

328
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,520
And now I'm having these anxiety attacks
where I'm breaking down emotionally and 

329
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,520
crying in public and I,
I can't,

330
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,810
I have no control over it.
And uh,

331
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,210
and happening in front of my family,
my wife and my kids,

332
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,260
and I was just like,
hey,

333
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,420
enough is enough.
And going out,

334
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,920
trying to find different things led me 
to let me demark Dr Gordon.

335
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,330
And He,
uh,

336
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,360
he introduced me to his protocols.
He actually sent me an email and the 

337
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,360
first line he says,
Hey Andrew,

338
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,041
you know,
I'm this and we're doing this and I'm 

339
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:03,041
not a coop by the way.
And I was like,

340
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:03,041
okay.
I liked that,

341
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,120
I liked that.
I liked that guy.

342
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,220
Yeah.
Very debatable introduction.

343
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:07,940
I'm not a cook.
I'm,

344
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:12,941
I'm interested in what he's doing.
Kooks will always tell you they're not 

345
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:12,941
kooks.
Yeah.

346
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:13,580
No.
So that's why I was drawn to him,

347
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,510
by the way.

348
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,910
Crazy.
Yeah.

349
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,420
So do you,
do you have a specific injury or a 

350
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,270
specific moment where things changed 
for,

351
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,330
you know,
I was an explosive breacher so I was in 

352
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:28,430
around explosions for my entire career.
You know what I mean?

353
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:31,700
I was only knocked unconscious one time 
in combat.

354
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,000
But the thing that mark was saying,
and this is just,

355
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,410
this goes outside the veteran 
population,

356
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,060
this goes with anybody.
But,

357
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:42,560
um,
the symptoms can come in months,

358
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,210
weeks,
years,

359
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:44,960
days,
whatever,

360
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,070
later,
right?

361
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,170
So it wasn't attributed to any one 
thing.

362
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:50,210
So six months later after my last 
deployment,

363
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,480
I'm starting to have these problems.
They're starting to manifest and when 

364
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,961
I'm,
when I'm bringing this up to the 

365
00:16:58,961 --> 00:16:58,961
attention,
you know,

366
00:16:58,961 --> 00:16:58,961
it's like,
okay,

367
00:16:58,961 --> 00:16:59,540
well this is a psychological issue.
And I'm like,

368
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,550
well,
I've been doing this for a long time.

369
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,050
This is what I want to be doing.

370
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,560
That's bullshit.
It's not a psychological issue and 

371
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,540
here's why I wouldn't be able to perform
like this and all of a sudden I just 

372
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:11,540
can't do it.
And,

373
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:11,540
and,
um,

374
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,780
so that,
that was just very frustrating,

375
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:14,780
you know,
in that regard,

376
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:15,570
trying,
trying to,

377
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,660
to come out and try to find some,
some real answers and only like mark 

378
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,851
said,
what it takes is an individualized 

379
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:24,851
approach,
right.

380
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:26,690
And uh,
and that uses evidence based diagnostics

381
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,670
to pinpoint and treat the underlying 
condition.

382
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,270
But nobody was trying to figure out my 
whole story.

383
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,020
Um,
and,

384
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,870
and when you don't do that,
you just take,

385
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,410
find out what the symptoms are and you 
treat those symptoms with medication,

386
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,540
then you're not,
you're not doing anything to fix it.

387
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,280
But um,
so that's,

388
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,560
that's kind of why it's hard to,
for,

389
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:46,690
for I think,
uh,

390
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,740
the medical community understand it 
right now because if you a problem

391
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,660
and you can't necessarily attribute that
to a major accident or a major injury or

392
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,730
a major explosion,
then it's like,

393
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:57,930
okay,
well we don't know what it is.

394
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:03,050
It's a psychological problem.
We're going to put them on packet a and 

395
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,560
we'll see how he is in two weeks.
Yeah,

396
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,080
that expression psychological issue is a
real tricky one,

397
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:12,081
isn't it?
Because your psychological makeup a lot 

398
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:15,891
of times is dependent upon your physical
health and what's going on in your body 

399
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:20,601
can greatly affect your mind,
but when someone says psychological 

400
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:21,900
issue,
especially for a guy like you,

401
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,430
what they're trying to say is that 
you're weak,

402
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,450
right?
They're trying to say that you can't 

403
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:28,560
handle the pressure salute and that 
you're cracking and this is what it is,

404
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,700
the integrity of it.
It's called Comorbid and this is an 

405
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,361
argument that's going back between the 
psychiatric world and the non 

406
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:38,700
psychiatric world.

407
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,700
We're in Comorbid,
which came first,

408
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,730
the situation that precipitated 
depression with the depression that's 

409
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,020
develops the situation in this 
particular instance relative to Andrew 

410
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,720
is his chemistry of his body was doing 
great until he had that group of insults

411
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:03,981
to them.
Whether or not it was that huge trump 

412
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:05,901
that got blown up 100 feet in the air 
and you've got the shockwave that 

413
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:05,901
knocked you out,
um,

414
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:09,420
or the repetitive gunfire that you had 
or the breaching.

415
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,090
How many licks does it take to get to 
the center of a tootsie roll?

416
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:13,140
Pop.
It's different for everybody.

417
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Everybody is so different.
So what happens is as you start losing 

418
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,351
these hormones,
I mean one of the hormones that I've 

419
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:21,351
repeated a number of times in our repeat
again,

420
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,480
pregnenolone has been found to control 
the anxiety affect in the body,

421
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
in the brain.
So morning anxiety or pregnenolone or 

422
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,000
social anxiety,
uh,

423
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,270
can be affected.

424
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,360
And you know,
I have patients who have been in auto 

425
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,720
accidents who never had anxiety attacks 
or panic attacks,

426
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:46,890
and they wake up six months after the 
injury and they've got morning anxiety.

427
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,220
They are pregnenolone levels.
Instead of being average about 110 are 

428
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,060
down at six or seven.
You correct them back 110,

429
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,100
their anxiety disappeared.
What is pregnant?

430
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,570
Pregnenolone is called the mother of all
hormones.

431
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,020
It comes from cholesterol.
It's the first hormone or steroid 

432
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,491
hormone,
official steroid hormone that comes off 

433
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:12,711
of cholesterol.
So if we interrupt cholesterol in our 

434
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:12,720
body,
we lose pregnenolone,

435
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,930
which becomes the precursor to the Aga 
and testosterone on one side and pro 

436
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,660
progesterone and cortisol and another 
side.

437
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,110
So with low pregnenolone,
it can lead to all the hormones that 

438
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,090
help to regulate our brain function and 
our life.

439
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:31,860
Cortisol,
if you don't have cortisol,

440
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:36,861
you get a syndrome called Addison's 
disease and you can die and most people 

441
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,340
associate cortisol with high levels of 
it being problematic,

442
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:39,060
right?
Stress,

443
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,350
stress,
stress related,

444
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:42,810
and you know,
everybody thinks it's emotional stress,

445
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:47,811
but there are five stressors.
You know there's emotional or 

446
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:48,400
intellectual,
emotional stress,

447
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:53,401
physical stress,
nutritional stress can precipitate high 

448
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:53,410
amount of cortisol.
If you're fasting,

449
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,440
cortisol goes up and then there's 
chemical stress like a chemotherapy or 

450
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,950
certain medication that you take alcohol
to.

451
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,400
Certain drugs can do it and they can 
influence the adrenal glands.

452
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:06,520
Production of Cortisol,
which is called an adaptogen,

453
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,030
which allows you to go from one level of
physical functioning,

454
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,790
mental functioning to another.
It adapts,

455
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,690
helps you to adapt,

456
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:14,990
you know?
Wow.

457
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,170
I gotta tell you when I have these 
conversations with you about this issue,

458
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:20,490
it's kind of frustrating to me because 
it seems like you're.

459
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,330
You're making all this sense and you're 
talking about this.

460
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:28,331
This is broad spectrum of different 
hormones and all these different 

461
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:32,171
variables that exist in the human mind 
and how importantly are to maintain 

462
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,290
proper levels of them for how for 
function.

463
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,890
But you're just not a lot of people like
you out there.

464
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:40,320
They're talking about this like,
this is what you're saying is,

465
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:44,870
is a fairly controversial treatment.
Dr Gordon to me like this,

466
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,420
he's like,
this is like 1960 and we're saying we're

467
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,020
going to put a man on the moon by 1969 
and everybody says you guys are bat shit

468
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:52,460
crazy.
You know what I mean?

469
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,020
That that's.
That's where we're at.

470
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,370
It's it seems like.
Is it because there's not a lot of 

471
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,530
motivation for innovation when it comes 
to treatment or is it a.

472
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,550
is it.
What's the resistance to understanding 

473
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:08,550
all these different variables?
If for 30 years

474
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,000
plus years you've been told that you 
treat depression by giving this pill,

475
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,150
that's either an Ssri or an Abcd or 
whatever it is you're going to give that

476
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:21,640
pill and if someone comes in,
a coupe comes in and says,

477
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:25,030
look at the literature for the past 35 
years,

478
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,770
even as far back as 1958 with Dah da Dah
da,

479
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,870
his antidepressant.
You come in with these natural products 

480
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,290
that have no patents on it,
that you can walk into a GNC,

481
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:43,291
you can get it from onnit,
you can get it from any of these 

482
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,721
companies and take it natural,
100 percent natural coming from Mexican 

483
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:50,101
wild yams and it fixes your depression 
and it costs you three cents a day,

484
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:56,011
five cents a day,
ten cents a day as opposed to the cost 

485
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:56,770
for some of these other medication.
Who are you going to believe?

486
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,890
This Kook who talks about over the 
counter product or the pharmaceutical 

487
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,190
rep who talks about this prescription 
medication.

488
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,520
That is the problem,
right?

489
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,910
Official sounding names and designations
and correct.

490
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,080
I got it and it's an uphill battle in 
the way that I approach it with my 

491
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,840
science background.
Not just medical,

492
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:19,841
but the science research I did in the 
beginning is to line up all the 

493
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:24,491
information,
irrefutable information and hand it to 

494
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:24,980
someone and read it.

495
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,430
See,
for a dummy like me who's obviously in 

496
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,490
the outside of all this,
how do I get you in trouble?

497
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,710
You got me in trouble.
You put that picture.

498
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:36,890
Will you have lunch together and you 
split here with the brilliant Dr Gordon.

499
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,410
I got a lot of shit from your people.
Why?

500
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,040
Because they said that you know you're.
You're a smart guy,

501
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,900
and I said,
you're absolutely brilliant.

502
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,470
Trust me,
I'm a dummy dummy.

503
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,150
They think I'm smart.
It's because if they think I'm smart 

504
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,150
because they're done with the,
call me dumb please.

505
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:59,140
But what I'm saying is like for someone 
like me that has zero science 

506
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,771
backgrounds,
what I always assume is that the way 

507
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:06,251
things got better and the way people 
figure things out is that they just 

508
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:08,000
looked at the facts and then when new 
facts came in,

509
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:13,001
they adjusted accordingly,
but it seems like there's resistance 

510
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:13,001
against that.
Correct.

511
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:17,370
The status quo is very clearly.
We hand everybody this antidepressant.

512
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,310
We're not gonna hand them this natural 
product that's been shown since 1986,

513
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:26,311
1958 on another large group of research 
to be beneficial blind washout studies 

514
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,450
for benefit and depression,
natural product.

515
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,580
They don't want to use natural products 
because it's in.

516
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:37,060
It's in essence,
as I see it stating that,

517
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:42,061
well,
you don't really need the 

518
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:42,370
pharmaceutical.
You can just get a natural product,

519
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,760
so do you think there's just so much 
money involved in pushing the 

520
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,581
pharmaceutical drugs that these doctors 
are reluctant to go against it or not 

521
00:24:50,581 --> 00:24:52,000
prescribe it or step out on a limb?

522
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,200
Well,
you know the the medical community,

523
00:24:56,201 --> 00:25:01,201
the medical boards of every state.
It's the standard of care in your 

524
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:05,071
community,
which means that if there are 100 

525
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:08,191
doctors in a community of physicians and
the standard for 99 percent of them is 

526
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:15,241
to use a SSRI.
The one doctor who uses a non ssr are I 

527
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,210
can be pulled into the medical board,
has practicing outside the scope of the 

528
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:26,491
medical community as well as doctors in 
general don't want to be looked at as 

529
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:30,370
being that one person who is trying to 
introduce something new,

530
00:25:30,371 --> 00:25:32,590
revolutionary,
something that's worth something.

531
00:25:32,591 --> 00:25:37,591
They worked very diligently at for 21 
years to show the science and the 

532
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:41,971
clinical cases that it works.
It's a maverick and our medical society 

533
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:44,050
doesn't work with Mavericks.
It works with mass.

534
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,470
There's a lot of forces that are kind of
stacked up against it,

535
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:51,190
but that doesn't mean that that's a 
reason to cower and not stand up to it.

536
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:56,191
Right?
I mean it's either it's either right or 

537
00:25:56,191 --> 00:25:56,640
it isn't right and we're saying Dr 
Gordon is right and we're going to.

538
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,690
We're gonna fight it to do our last 
breath to change it into 300 million 

539
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,760
people in America on antidepressants.
And if,

540
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,180
if you're on an antidepressant and 
you're still depressed,

541
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:08,680
guess what?
It's probably not.

542
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:10,240
That's probably not the underlying 
condition.

543
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,330
It's what science has shown us.
Its a hormonal imbalance or able to 

544
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,830
interdict that and effectively treat it.
And the problem is,

545
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:19,300
you know,
using the term hormone,

546
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:21,880
I've been slowly getting away from the 
neuroactive steroids,

547
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,140
steroids,
these neuro active neuroactive steroids 

548
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,140
are,
we'll say neuro steroids.

549
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,540
It was

550
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,790
found in 1986 by a Dr blue out of bay 
loop out of Paris,

551
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:37,470
France,
that the brain has the chemistry to take

552
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,320
cholesterol and to make it into 
testosterone,

553
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:44,700
make it into pregnenolone,
make it into progesterone in the brain.

554
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,110
For many,
many years,

555
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:49,260
biopsies of the brain would find 
testosterone it and they thought it came

556
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:54,261
from,
you know your testicles or thyroid in 

557
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:54,261
the that came from your thyroid gland in
the neck.

558
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:59,000
What we're finding is neuro steroids are
made what we called the Nova within the 

559
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:04,221
brain itself,
and when you have trauma or 

560
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:04,221
inflammation,
you lose that,

561
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:09,021
and that's why I believe based on 
reading the literature and my 

562
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:09,330
interpretation,
that's what can be faulted.

563
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:14,331
How I interpret it is that that is the 
cause for all the transitions in the 

564
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:18,561
brain,
but there are receptors in the brain 

565
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:22,280
that regulate how nerves conduct and 
what they found is these nerves have not

566
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:23,400
only magnesium.

567
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,350
Zinc is a volume receptor,
and they found a pregnenolone receptor,

568
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,880
so they found a receptor which 
pregnenolone works to regulate,

569
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:37,881
to smooth out,
to calm you down so that you're not 

570
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:39,960
having panic attacks or emotional 
turpitude and yelling,

571
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:44,961
screaming,
and picking up a gun and shooting 

572
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:45,420
someone or throwing something or yelling
or beating someone up,

573
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:50,421
getting assaulted.
Her sympathetic nervous system has just 

574
00:27:50,421 --> 00:27:50,880
gone crazy.
The whole,

575
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,960
the entire nervous system goes off,
so in a sense,

576
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:57,990
what you're saying is there's different 
types of testosterone,

577
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:02,991
different types of hormones that are 
produced in different areas of the body 

578
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:03,190
that it's not just your testicles that 
are doing it.

579
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,980
Correct.
It's the same testosterone.

580
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,830
You know,
people talk about bio equivalent bio.

581
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,520
What is it?
Bio identical hormones,

582
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,820
testosterone.
To be testosterone has to be equal 

583
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,150
bioequivalent,
so the brain produces the same 

584
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:20,460
testosterone as the testicles.

585
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,290
The brain produces same pregnenolone as 
the cholesterol elsewhere in the city.

586
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,410
When the brain is injured,
it no longer produces it at the correct 

587
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,080
levels,
correct.

588
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,200
You lose it.
In studies that are done in Alzheimer's 

589
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,751
patients,
they found the frontal lobes of the 

590
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:38,751
brain,
which regulates executive function,

591
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,470
making sure that you make the right 
decision.

592
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,890
You're able to make the coffee in the 
right sequence,

593
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:47,610
making sure the butters at the end is 
all regulated by the frontal part of the

594
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:52,611
brain,
which is the most common area that is 

595
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,951
damaged in to and fro kind of auto 
accidents or explosions throw you back,

596
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,060
so they found pregnenolone.
Pregnenolone deficiency,

597
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:02,250
the same thing.
We're finding in boxers,

598
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,920
in pugilists,
in MMA and everybody,

599
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:09,921
there's a deficiency,
and I think I shared with you a nfl did 

600
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:13,311
a study where they found that 19 times 
faster box of nfl players are 19 times 

601
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:21,990
more prone to develop Alzheimer's 
disease between 30 and 50 years of age.

602
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,180
What else?
Wait a second.

603
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,670
Thirty years of age developing 
Alzheimer's.

604
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,940
Did you see that recent study that said 
96 percent of all former players have a 

605
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,640
gte?
Yep.

606
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,070
Ninety six percent.
Ninety six percent.

607
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
That's incredible.
Let's see.

608
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:41,590
Uh,
it was 97 out of 98.

609
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,890
People have brains that were tested,
had cte,

610
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,880
which I guess is 96 percent phenomenal.
And why don't they do the same testing 

611
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:52,820
for military and soldiers?

612
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,560
Yeah.
What Dr Gordon was saying about all the 

613
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,560
different neuro steroids,
for instance,

614
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,651
like cholesterol,
he's saying as a precursor to 

615
00:30:01,651 --> 00:30:01,651
testosterone.
So,

616
00:30:01,651 --> 00:30:02,680
but if you take a stat and drug that 
lowers your cholesterol,

617
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,090
guess what?
The byproduct that is,

618
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,460
it messes up your testosterone.
So what,

619
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,220
what we're understanding is our 
chemistry is all linked,

620
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,420
man.
It's all together.

621
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:12,760
If you do,
you can't just treat testosterone.

622
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,820
If the stuff above it isn't as affected 
and you're not treating that well,

623
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,620
guess what?
The military model doesn't even test for

624
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:21,070
that and if you're not treating things 
below testosterone that,

625
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,170
that produces,
I'm at that level with it.

626
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,290
If it's deficient or insufficient,
then you're not going to get what you 

627
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:28,290
need.
So until you look at your body,

628
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,490
your chemistry as a whole and you 
interdicted accordingly,

629
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,690
you're going to continue to have this,
these mass problems across the board and

630
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:37,870
the ones that are manifesting and uh,
with soldiers,

631
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:39,850
with fighters,
with football players.

632
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,640
But you know,
at the end if you take these drugs,

633
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,890
alter it then with the civilian 
population as well.

634
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:47,980
So it's not just a,
like a niche market here,

635
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,200
it's everybody is affected by this.
So this is the,

636
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:52,090
what's amazing about what Dr Warren's 
doing.

637
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,130
It could fix a lot of things.
One of the,

638
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:59,190
the things that has just come up on the 
table is looking back at the thousand 

639
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,260
plus people that we've put on a program.
Unfortunately we only have about 50 

640
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,840
veterans on program.
The rest are civilians.

641
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:10,290
What we're seeing is those that are 
addicted to opioids or narcotics or 

642
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,290
alcohol addiction are able to get off at
rapidly.

643
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,710
When Matthew was on here,
Matthew was on 15 different drugs of 

644
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,981
that grouping.
He was on eight oxycotton a day and I 

645
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:23,110
spoke to him recently specifically about
this.

646
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:26,740
He was taking it for 18 months.
He was on morphine 40 tablets.

647
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:29,740
It's either 40 or 60 milligrams per 
tablet and then fentanyl,

648
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,840
fentanyl patch,
fentanyl patch,

649
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,620
which is a pain patch,
and in six weeks he was off of 14 of the

650
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,480
15 medications,
a pain patch on top of all those pills,

651
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,590
but he had.
He had surgery on his jaw with six pins.

652
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,770
He had treadmill pulled out of his list,
left Occiput,

653
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,040
and he had his left leg.
I think it was shot out and he had 

654
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,461
chronic pain.
That's why he was on all these pain 

655
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:56,461
medications.
He's off all of that now.

656
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:56,920
Wow.
Because you know,

657
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,950
vitamin D deficiency has been found to 
be a cause for inflammation.

658
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,280
It also low vitamin D,
You have a very low pain threshold.

659
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,310
Increasing vitamin D improves that 
testosterone changes how we perceive 

660
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,390
pain.
I'm stabilizing the pregnenolone and all

661
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,030
those hormones in the brain changes how 
we perceive life.

662
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,760
When you're depressed,
you perceive pain,

663
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,360
very little pain as big pain when you're
not depressed.

664
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,170
Oh,
okay.

665
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,670
Bump yourself,
get better.

666
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:25,990
Wow.

667
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,550
No.
When we were having this conversation at

668
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:31,320
lunch,
when we're talking about this,

669
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:36,350
you were bringing up stem cells and the,
the effect that stem cells are having 

670
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,130
and stem cell injections on,
on people that have all sorts

671
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,480
of serious traumatic injuries,
is that with the brain as well?

672
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,330
Um,
have they figured out how to squirt that

673
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:50,690
shit into your dome in,
let's see,

674
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,960
19,
2012.

675
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:58,961
I went to Germany to Dusseldorf,
Germany to work for the doctors who was 

676
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:02,030
taking autologous stem cells.
He take out of the patient's stem cells,

677
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,960
send them to Israel to get an augmented,
to increase the amount and get them back

678
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:10,961
in 48 hours.
And then this absolutely incredible 

679
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:14,300
three dimensional positioning needle 
that use three dimension,

680
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:15,410
three axis,
these x,

681
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,040
y,
and Z.

682
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:21,190
and was able to go.
We drilled a hole in the skull and we 

683
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,360
put a needle in directly into the fourth
ventricle,

684
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:28,361
which is that fluid compartment in the 
brain and injected the stem cells and 

685
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:30,080
it's spread out to the brain to the 
brain stem,

686
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:33,020
because this gentleman had a brainstem 
hemorrhage,

687
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,210
and within 48 hours to 72 hours,
he started having these improvements,

688
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,430
hearing improved physical functioning.

689
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,640
He was in a wheelchair with a belt to 
hold them in place.

690
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,080
Three days later,
he's not using a belt for 12 years since

691
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:51,590
he had his stroke.
He wasn't able to pick up a coffee cup,

692
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,270
a coffee Mug,
and hold it.

693
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:58,271
He can only use a straw.
He was picking up his Coffee Cup and 

694
00:33:58,271 --> 00:33:58,760
drinking it.
So there,

695
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,120
there are places around the planet that 
are using stem cells and people with 

696
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,710
Alzheimer's,
with als,

697
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,920
with traumatic brain injury.
And it's getting benefits.

698
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:12,650
There are benefits in my projects in 
Beijing,

699
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:17,651
China,
the stem cells called Mesenchymal stem 

700
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:19,730
cells,
which are the ones that loved the organs

701
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:20,790
come from,
uh,

702
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,850
in diabetics injecting one injection of 
10 million mesenchymal cells into the 

703
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:31,250
patient through an IV,
30 percent of them lost their diabetes,

704
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:36,470
a 45 percent and had a decrease in their
insulin requirement and 25 percent of 

705
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,400
them didn't have any effect.

706
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,540
And this is a center with 26 md phds in 
Beijing that tops in their field.

707
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,230
So there's a lot of hope in that as 
well.

708
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:51,110
Correct.
That seems like something that would,

709
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,190
if you're injecting it directly into the
traumatic,

710
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,650
the area has experienced trauma.
Yeah.

711
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,430
There's a,
uh,

712
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,050
orthopedic,
a buddy of mine,

713
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,720
a sentinel sentinel who's,
um,

714
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:08,410
was using autologous stem cells that he 
pulled out a patient and injected into 

715
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,110
the knees and get rebuild of the knees 
without needing surgery.

716
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,280
What I'm hearing too is about rebuilding
cartloads that people have had bone on 

717
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,280
bone cartilage.
They're rebuilding it.

718
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,810
Correct.
There are a couple of protocols.

719
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:22,811
There was one by a Dr Allen are done out
of Miami orthopedic surgeon who showed 

720
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:29,471
that if you go in with the arthroscopic 
scope and you use a bird,

721
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,990
which is like a,
a sandpaper device and you rubbed the 

722
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,951
bone and then injected with growth 
hormone that he was able to get five to 

723
00:35:38,951 --> 00:35:38,951
10

724
00:35:38,951 --> 00:35:42,000
millimeters of regeneration of cartilage
in our office.

725
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:44,460
We use prolific,
huge significant,

726
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,640
and he did a Harvard study that is 
publication Kane at Harvard.

727
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,120
He patented the toe thick,
10 millimeters.

728
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,220
That's incredible.
Not Ten centimeters.

729
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:54,970
Ten millimeter.
Twenty $5 a.

730
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,410
that's a pad.
Yeah.

731
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:00,120
It's a nice thickness that developed.
So um,

732
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,180
but no one's doing that because it's 
illegal to use growth hormone in that 

733
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,351
fashion.
A growth hormone has a very restricted 

734
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:09,420
use parameters on it.
Why is that?

735
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:11,130
Because like baseball players and shit.
Well,

736
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:14,310
I think that had a lot to do with it.
Public Impressions of it.

737
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,320
This stuff works.
It works phenomenally well.

738
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,820
That's so frustrating to me when 
something that's really,

739
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:25,821
really effective gets illegal because 
athletes are using it and becoming more 

740
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:26,500
effective.
It's just,

741
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,800
it's so silly.
It's a complete misconception.

742
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,660
It's ludicrous.
If the goal is,

743
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,700
if the true altruistic goal in medicine 
is to fix people,

744
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:41,570
then why are we being restricted in 
using the things that we see fixing 

745
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:41,570
people?

746
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,740
Well,
the stem cell stuff was everybody was 

747
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,781
always worried that people were going to
get it from fetuses and then somehow 

748
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:51,111
it's going to encourage abortions until 
they figured out how to get it from 

749
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:52,510
other means and once they figured out 
how to like get it from.

750
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,660
And then now that,
that debates off the table,

751
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:56,700
but for the longest time that was the 
big issue.

752
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:58,150
Like during the Bush administration.
Yeah.

753
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,680
They held back stem cell research 
because of the right wing Christians.

754
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:05,160
Right.
I think there's one cell,

755
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:06,620
single cell,
single cell,

756
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,100
single cell.
Yeah.

757
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,510
Uh,
I think it's what,

758
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:13,650
10 years that they put the moratorium on
doing any research in stem cells,

759
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:17,250
which is giving Switzerland is giving 
China,

760
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,520
is giving Russia,
you know,

761
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,580
massive advantage to be,
to be diagnosed clinically as dead,

762
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:26,010
you have to be brain dead.
So if there's not even a brain in there,

763
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,090
how,
how can you say that?

764
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:32,090
Taking a single cell,
I mean picking your nose is going to 

765
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,360
kill more single cells then doing that 
for stem cell research,

766
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,540
but the reaper cut real quick killing 
your single cells.

767
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:40,440
But the repercussion of that could be a 
game changer across the for everything.

768
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,400
Yeah.
I,

769
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:43,460
you know,
I used to think of stem cells as well.

770
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,870
That's kind of interesting.
Uh,

771
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,320
some future therapy that's going to be 
cool until I got a shot into my shoulder

772
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,000
and I'm like,
holy fuck.

773
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,810
Like this is nuts.
Like this shoulder is bothering me for a

774
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,280
year.
Not Bothering me at all anymore.

775
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,920
How quick turnaround is that?
A couple of weeks.

776
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,840
Within a couple of weeks I started 
feeling great.

777
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,390
Now it's two months out.
Now it's been two months out.

778
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:06,690
I don't have any pain.
PRP or stem cells,

779
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,000
stem cells where they get the stem,
placenta,

780
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,630
placenta,
they have a technique which is prp,

781
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:15,810
which is platelet rich plasma,
which is similar to.

782
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,190
Right.
It gets a of cope.

783
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,260
Well,
it's similar to a Regena cane,

784
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,640
right?
Except that they don't,

785
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,700
they don't.
Regeneca is that stuff that Dr Peter 

786
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,450
Welling figured out in Germany,
that's the blood spinning procedure that

787
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:31,830
heat up the blood,
like a more advanced version of platelet

788
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:35,650
rich plasma and what they do and I think
it Australia,

789
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:40,651
they expose it to a specials frequency 
of ultraviolet light to take care of any

790
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:46,621
of the inflammatory chemistry that's in 
there through a photo of the activation 

791
00:38:46,621 --> 00:38:51,510
and the PRP works very well seen as 
something that's more acceptable than 

792
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:57,811
doing autologous stem cell,
which there's a number of ways to do it 

793
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:57,811
though,
is the point.

794
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:58,150
There's a number of different ways to 
get stem cells.

795
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:03,390
Yeah,
well a lot of UFC fighters getting it 

796
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,251
now and what they're doing,
a good percentage of them or they get 

797
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:06,070
their fat sucked out of their body out 
opposed.

798
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,790
They're turning that into stem cells.
Then shooting into their knees and their

799
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,060
shoulders and what have you,
and having incredible results.

800
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,610
A lot of MMA fight.
A lot of grapplers are doing it.

801
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,230
I need to get that done.
Yeah,

802
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:18,370
dude,
I'm telling you man,

803
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:18,820
I,
I,

804
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,390
I mean I don't know if mine's an 
isolated incident,

805
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,850
but I'm,
I'm just so blown away.

806
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,920
I was on the verge of surgery.
I was thinking,

807
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:28,780
okay,
I'll be out for three months.

808
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:30,560
We'll be in a sling for eight weeks.
Baba,

809
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,800
I was going over my head how much 
downtime,

810
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:35,170
what can I do during that downtime?
And I was,

811
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,510
I was preparing to have a useless 
shoulder.

812
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,550
Now all of a sudden I'm doing 
everything.

813
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,710
I mean with zero pain,
it's just,

814
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,250
it.
Some weird noise is still,

815
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:46,540
it's kind of right,
but there's no pain and no limit,

816
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,750
no restriction in movement.
Like there's no it doesn't,

817
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,270
there's no impingements no,
no.

818
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,290
Jerking off is no problem.

819
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,370
I have a.
yeah,

820
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,170
that's crazy.
Mark.

821
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:58,550
I have a non union,
my left Fibula,

822
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:01,520
so it's,
it's broken and I would love to do that.

823
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:06,990
Non Union and your fibula.
Fibula is a small bowl or non white non 

824
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,990
weight bearing bone in two.
I have a metal,

825
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,130
a titanium plate and it got broken to 
pieces on my first deployment and I just

826
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:16,880
never had it fixed.
So the plates broken to place broken and

827
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:17,510
uh,
so I've been,

828
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:20,420
they've wanted to fix it but they're 
like nine month rehab and I was like,

829
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:21,770
no way.
Nine months.

830
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:22,580
Yeah,
yeah,

831
00:40:22,581 --> 00:40:24,230
absolutely.
It doesn't work now.

832
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,190
Right,
right.

833
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:29,270
So they would take the titanium plate 
out a re a graph.

834
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,340
It had the graph,
the graph it take stuff for my hip 

835
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:34,520
apparently.
And I was just like,

836
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:36,020
it's not worth it.
I'm just going to keep on,

837
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,100
keep on keeping on.

838
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:42,490
But uh,
and then I knew I found out about stem 

839
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:42,490
cells and I'm,
I'm just gonna wait till I can do that.

840
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,600
We'll be back next week.
And can the stem cells fix that?

841
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:47,570
They can help with the bones that are 
non.

842
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,780
If they're close enough help with 
nonunion fusion.

843
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,820
Helped with fusion.
Well,

844
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,270
yeah,
it could help regenerate.

845
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:54,810
And then the speed up,
the,

846
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,430
the therapy time,
the turnaround time for your.

847
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,020
Well again,
you know.

848
00:40:58,021 --> 00:40:58,740
Right.
So if it's,

849
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,010
know if it's nine months now,
maybe it's three months.

850
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,420
It's just so frustrating when you hear 
about how much time they spent

851
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,890
banning stem cell research because of 
the new research that they're doing now 

852
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,470
and regenerating things.
I mean,

853
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:12,750
they,
they,

854
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:17,751
they've just,
they've sequenced the gene of the 

855
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:18,260
flatworm and they think they're going to
be able to figure out within x amount of

856
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:20,570
years how to regenerate limbs.
Like,

857
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:21,890
what the fuck,
man,

858
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,860
we're,
we're getting into some really crazy 

859
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,040
area with state of science and medicine.
So what do we do?

860
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:33,050
We stop using all the technology that 
can help people today waiting for the 

861
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,230
technology decade

862
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,110
from now on.
That's even sillier.

863
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,770
Definitely.
That's what's happened.

864
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,690
It's so fast.
No reasons being applied this problem.

865
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,450
Yeah.
Well,

866
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:43,040
it seems to me that,
that,

867
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,100
that stem cells would be a really good 
one for people with traumatic brain 

868
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,100
injury.
I mean,

869
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,650
when you think about that,
no,

870
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,860
I think stem cells is a good option.
Um,

871
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,960
you know,
but what is it that you're looking at?

872
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:57,320
You look at someone who has had a loss 
of a segment of their brain,

873
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,720
you want to try and regenerate it.
Um,

874
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,220
we know that possible.
Well,

875
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,090
we know from studies that were done back
in 1911,

876
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,000
uh,
there was a Dr Kegel.

877
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,970
Nineteen,
28 is a doc up in mcgill university,

878
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:16,030
a guru,
a total girl who's does regenerative 

879
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:19,991
research.
The only reason why nerves can 

880
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:22,660
regenerate is because they're in a non 
permissive environment is what I call it

881
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,450
lecture.

882
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:28,450
I give on this specific topic,
is that there are so many chemicals in 

883
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:32,390
the brain that are trying to foster 
regeneration of nerves.

884
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:37,391
Like for instance,
usually I just doing a study on a 

885
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:37,730
byproduct of progesterone called Aloe 
pregnenolone,

886
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,110
which is neuro regenerative,
a snapped agentic,

887
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:46,070
which means that the connection from one
nerve to another nerve is a synapse.

888
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,620
If it's damaged,
it can regenerate.

889
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:53,621
It also pray.
Allopregnanolone is a free radical 

890
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:53,780
scavenger.
As we age,

891
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,740
as our biochemistry changes in the 
energy production in our brain,

892
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,920
through mitochondria changes,
a lot more of oxidation occurs or free 

893
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:08,021
radicals,
and that's called oxidative stress and 

894
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:11,021
it's believed,
especially in great articles by a 

895
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:11,021
gentleman at USC,
a caliphate.

896
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:15,930
Finch talks about aging of the brain and
loss of our functioning due to this 

897
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:20,831
oxidative stress,
and he believes that oxidative stress 

898
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,341
leads to hormone deficiency,
leads to physical deficiency and death 

899
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,400
and recent group of articles showed,
uh,

900
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:33,350
we're seeing a lot of a type of diabetes
called insulin resistant diabetes.

901
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:38,350
Were you making too much insulin because
it's not being recognized by the cells.

902
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,740
So they found in these group of articles
came out that if there's inflammation of

903
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:44,360
an area of the brain called the 
hypothalamus,

904
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:48,710
which regulates our energy use,
that it can predispose you to developing

905
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,480
this situation called insulin resistant 
diabetes or the Metabolic Syndrome.

906
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,860
So we've been tracking our patient 
population who have had significant head

907
00:43:57,861 --> 00:44:02,861
trauma,
whether or not it's blast with physical 

908
00:44:02,861 --> 00:44:05,321
injury or blunt head injury.
Someone who fell off a second story and 

909
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:06,410
hit their head was unconscious for a 
month.

910
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,910
Uh,
they're developed,

911
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:12,911
they've developed or they came into the 
office already with this insulin 

912
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:17,051
resistance and it's easy to fix,
correct their hormones given chromate 

913
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:18,290
and monitor them.
What's chromium?

914
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Chromium is a mineral metal which is 
important for insulin recognition at the

915
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:28,640
cell wall.
And it was called by c Everett Koop,

916
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:29,510
the,
um,

917
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,480
the insulin tolerant factor back in the 
late nineties.

918
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:38,720
So this chromium hooked up to a nice and
called chromium poly.

919
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,090
Nakota donated.
The trade name is called chromate.

920
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,570
I,
we use it for our patients with type two

921
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:48,810
diabetes called insulin resistance.
And they all reverse.

922
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,310
They all get better,
their blood sugar stabilized,

923
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:53,760
the fats get better and their insulin 
comes down.

924
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,240
So we had,
in fact one of our neighbors had an 

925
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,240
insulin level,
a hundred 17.

926
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,410
It should be less than 25 once we 
correct it,

927
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:04,050
is two stops.
Drone and his chromium,

928
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,120
his levels dropped down below 30,
which is where you'd like to have it.

929
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:13,310
You know,
I was listening to this radio lab 

930
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:13,310
podcast recently and they were talking 
about lithium.

931
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,340
There was a woman who takes lithium 
because she's a,

932
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,550
I guess it's bipolar and uh,
I didn't know lithium is just a salt 

933
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,180
lithium chloride sodium.
Yeah.

934
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,810
It's just an element.

935
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,260
And coordinate takes this and she's fun.
Yeah.

936
00:45:28,261 --> 00:45:31,530
I haven't looked at it,
but there are people,

937
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:33,830
you can buy it over the counter now,
but very low.

938
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:34,560
Yeah,
lithium,

939
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:36,750
you can buy over the counter ended.
I haven't.

940
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:41,360
For what?
That's what I need to go learn lithium.

941
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,710
Yeah,
because it seems like for me,

942
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,510
ignorantly when I heard that,
I was like,

943
00:45:45,511 --> 00:45:50,511
well,
I thought lithium was some hardcore 

944
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:52,470
Prozac type drug that they put people on
when they're out of their fucking mind.

945
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:57,471
I didn't think it was just a salt,
so it's metal or was it beneficial Dr 

946
00:45:57,471 --> 00:46:02,180
Gordon or cannot be used for official.
Starting to what started it was I would 

947
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,820
see patients coming in with bipolar and 
being on lithium and then started seeing

948
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,850
patients who are coming in on it,
you know,

949
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,860
just taking it as because of articles 
and life extension magazine or one of 

950
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,881
those other science based journals or 
magazines.

951
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,660
But I haven't had a chance to go and 
look at it closely,

952
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:24,120
but it's very impressive.
It's the metals,

953
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:29,121
you know,
it's like a magnesium works on one of 

954
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:29,940
the brain receptors that if you take 
magnesium,

955
00:46:29,941 --> 00:46:32,280
it'll make you calm.
Magnesium metal,

956
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,620
you're talking about a solid magnesium 
carbonate magnesium.

957
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,310
Zinc makes your testosterone goes up,
right?

958
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:42,350
Correct.
Zincs involved in 300 processes in the 

959
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:42,660
body,
it's anti viral and anti cancer and it's

960
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:46,050
anti Alzheimer's and 300 processes in 
the body.

961
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:48,450
One of them is a natural Roman tastes 
inhibitor,

962
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:53,660
so I've never used the idexx in my 
practice or an astros salt in my 

963
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:53,660
practice.
What does that mean?

964
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,960
Aromatase inhibitor,
aromatase swelled.

965
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,990
Testosterone converts to Estradiol 
naturally and it's the body adapts to 

966
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:06,531
what we do to it.
If you give an overwhelming amount of 

967
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:06,531
testosterone to the body,
the body says,

968
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:07,860
oh,
now what am I going to do with this?

969
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,140
So it will either send it down to 
estrogen,

970
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,510
Estradiol,
or it'll send it to another thing called

971
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:16,870
dihydrotestosterone.
Estrodial obviously get man boobs.

972
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:19,020
She got crying,
whipping and so forth.

973
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:24,470
And dht causes hair loss,
causes testicles to show how you looked 

974
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,510
at my head when you said that.
Well,

975
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,260
saddleback back.
So,

976
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,030
um,
there are side effects.

977
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:31,960
So,
um,

978
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,060
in,
in replenishing testosterone,

979
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:35,830
you have to be careful with the balance 
you use.

980
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:39,550
Otherwise you start throwing things in 
like an astro which blocks Esta dial,

981
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:42,520
which is extremely important for 
generating growth hormone in the brain,

982
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:47,850
helping blood flow and keeping the 
immune system unique to the brain 

983
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:48,230
functional.
So you know,

984
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:53,310
everything we do,
there's always a risk to benefit factor 

985
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:56,461
that needs to be looked at.
And I think that some of the risk 

986
00:47:56,461 --> 00:47:56,461
factors are being ignored.

987
00:47:56,461 --> 00:47:57,080
This woman in this,
uh,

988
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:02,110
this radiolab podcast,
he was having an issue with kidney 

989
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:02,930
failure and they were going to make her 
get off of the lithium.

990
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,760
The lithium has a negative publicity,

991
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:10,870
well,
it has toxicity and it's dose dependent 

992
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,261
toxicity.
And then the uniqueness of the person's 

993
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:14,540
biochemistry,
you can make a very low amount toxic for

994
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,670
you or another person and it's 
meaningless

995
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,100
to silver.
This woman who was this massive conflict

996
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:24,101
because this,
this stuff was saving her when she had 

997
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,300
allowed her to be herself and now all of
a sudden they were telling her,

998
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:31,301
you're going to have to get off of it.
And she had been off of it before and 

999
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:34,481
just lost her marbles,
saving her and killing her at the same 

1000
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:34,481
time.
Yeah.

1001
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:35,240
Yeah.
It's crazy.

1002
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:40,241
It's A.
is there another way that people can 

1003
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:40,300
avoid that?
Is there,

1004
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,510
is,
there is another way that it could have.

1005
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,520
They could avoid the effects of being 
bipolar,

1006
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,720
exercise,
diet,

1007
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,480
anything.
Well,

1008
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,870
do you want to say anything about that 
Andrew?

1009
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,460
Um,
we,

1010
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,530
we think that you can treat that by 
treating a neuroactive steroids in the 

1011
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:55,530
brain.
And,

1012
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:55,530
uh,
it's,

1013
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,780
it's been shown that it's been backed up
by evidence and proof and his clinical 

1014
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,630
application as well.
But that's very much the case.

1015
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,500
So how does that work?
I'm testosterone is a generally 

1016
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:12,460
perceived as being a sex hormone or 
being a reproductive hormone.

1017
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:17,461
What we're finding is that it's involved
in an incredible array of different 

1018
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:19,040
processes in the body,
uh,

1019
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,720
studies on the emotional center of the 
brain.

1020
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:27,721
The limbic system found that it helps to
stabilize a panic and also anger and 

1021
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:31,270
aggression in reactiveness to our 
environment.

1022
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,700
If it's slow,
you're hyper reactive.

1023
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:37,300
They're finding that in a Anorexia 
Nervosa,

1024
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,390
uh,
women who are starving themselves,

1025
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:43,870
who do have a psychological issues to 
it,

1026
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,620
if they don't respond to treatment,
giving them testosterone improves it.

1027
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:52,980
So what we're starting to see is these,
a neuro steroids and neuroactive 

1028
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,340
steroids have influence on an array of,
um,

1029
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:02,580
psychological or mood disorders and one 
of them is in bipolar in the case that 

1030
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:06,520
we're just touching on,
um,

1031
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:11,650
gentleman who was diagnosed with bipolar
by the military and was put onto lithium

1032
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,330
and also add at the same time.
So,

1033
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:21,870
and then what happened was he was given 
a challenge test with a low dose of 

1034
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:25,621
testosterone and within 32 hours or so,
Dana has symptoms disappeared.

1035
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:28,860
That's incredible.
The,

1036
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:34,540
the,
the combination of things working 

1037
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,601
together synergistically.
It was one of the most incredible parts 

1038
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:36,601
of it.
Correct it.

1039
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:40,020
And this is something that,
it just seems that a lot of people just 

1040
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:40,020
simply not aware of.

1041
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,680
Correct.
The analogy that I use is,

1042
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:43,360
you know,
brand new corvettes,

1043
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:48,670
absolutely bitch and cars,
and it's like having a corvette with 

1044
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,411
four flat tires.
Now all we're going to do is going to 

1045
00:50:52,411 --> 00:50:53,860
fill up one of the tires with air and 
you're going to try and drive the car.

1046
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:55,600
You're not going to be able to drive the
car.

1047
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:58,000
Let's fill up the front two tires and 
drive.

1048
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:03,030
Okay,
let's go and fill up three and a half 

1049
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,030
tires and you going to drive.
It's not going to happen.

1050
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:06,310
The synergy is in all the hormones that 
we have in our body,

1051
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:11,340
all the chemistry together to give us a 
level of benefit of function that one by

1052
00:51:12,431 --> 00:51:17,431
itself cannot do,
and if you look at the failure reports 

1053
00:51:17,431 --> 00:51:19,030
that are in traumatic brain injuries 
since 1959,

1054
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:24,330
it's called a futility failure where 
these big pharmaceutical companies took 

1055
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:29,221
these great drugs and gave one product 
to an individual which Madec brain 

1056
00:51:29,221 --> 00:51:31,420
injury and they didn't get any benefit 
greater than 10 percent.

1057
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,400
That's called failure or futility 
failure,

1058
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:39,210
and it's because in other people are 
writing the because is because our 

1059
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:43,280
system is so complex.
How do you expect one product to fix it?

1060
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,190
It can't

1061
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,380
and everything's got to be balanced.
It's all got to be balanced.

1062
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:55,030
There's such an issue in this country 
when it comes to mental health that 

1063
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,191
mental health doesn't get looked at like
the health of a bone or the health of a 

1064
00:51:58,191 --> 00:51:58,191
muscle.
You know,

1065
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,200
if you have a torn muscle,
you have to get an emergency operation 

1066
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,200
to reattach it.
Right.

1067
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,130
But if your brain is fucked,
it's like,

1068
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:06,480
come on,
don't be a pussy.

1069
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:07,220
Yeah.
You know,

1070
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,090
toughen up or,
you know,

1071
00:52:09,091 --> 00:52:11,280
stop.
Stop being so down on yourself.

1072
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,200
We're this.
We're the sum of our chemistry.

1073
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:13,820
I mean that,
that,

1074
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,960
that's the deal.
When that's affected,

1075
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,460
that's when you have these,
uh,

1076
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,870
these different things that manifest

1077
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:24,190
why we're seeing so many of the vets 
coming back and committing suicide 

1078
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,190
because they've been instilled with 
exactly what you say.

1079
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,110
Don't be a pussy,
you know,

1080
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:28,930
man up and do it.
That's what.

1081
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,750
Yeah,
it was then.

1082
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,920
And that's why it was easy for me to 
say,

1083
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:36,921
well,
I can speak to my credibility that 

1084
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:36,921
that's not the case.
So let's find,

1085
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:37,730
let's find some damn answer,
right?

1086
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,810
Because we're flying,
falling off the crazy train.

1087
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,560
Right,
right,

1088
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:41,010
right.
Yeah.

1089
00:52:41,011 --> 00:52:43,320
For a guy like you,
that's where it's so clear.

1090
00:52:43,321 --> 00:52:43,860
It's like,
you know,

1091
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:45,570
you're not a pussy,
so what the hell's going on?

1092
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:47,850
For example,
that have self doubt.

1093
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,880
It's like,
well maybe they're right and maybe with 

1094
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,550
that psychologist says is right,
maybe I should take this medication and 

1095
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,200
now that's compounding a problem and 
making it even bigger and that's why 

1096
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
we're having these suicides.
And also,

1097
00:53:01,201 --> 00:53:06,201
you know,
one of the things that's been 

1098
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:07,191
fascinating to me over the last couple 
of years is finding out all the 

1099
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:08,910
different things that we do that change 
a hormone levels of our body.

1100
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:14,120
Like all the different things you could 
do during the day that up your 

1101
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,511
testosterone,
including like just drop what they 

1102
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:20,271
called peacocking driving a nice car 
around a bunch of young ladies actually 

1103
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,920
rises,
raises your testosterone like,

1104
00:53:22,921 --> 00:53:27,921
ah,
what the fuck is going on with our 

1105
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:27,921
bodies?
Like weird.

1106
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:27,921
Is it

1107
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:28,590
that there's like moods,
the changing and mood,

1108
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:30,400
like happy moments?
Correct.

1109
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,600
Like literally will change the chemical 
evolution,

1110
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,130
makeup

1111
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,750
evolution of man,
you know what I mean?

1112
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:39,200
And that was a natural selection that 
when women were around,

1113
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:41,340
I was gonna you know,
you're going to perk up and down,

1114
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:45,660
got to get ready to party when a woman 
opulate said they,

1115
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,680
you know,
14,

1116
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,670
15,
16,

1117
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,300
there's a spike in testosterone.
So she's oblating.

1118
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:54,270
She has a spike in her testosterone.
What does she want to do?

1119
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,180
Get Our party on,
get up,

1120
00:53:56,181 --> 00:53:58,950
party on.
She wants to get that fertilization,

1121
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,220
dance,
going to dance.

1122
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,570
That's happened.
That happens also to a lot of women that

1123
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:06,270
get older when they put them on hormone 
replacement,

1124
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:08,600
once they experience menopause,
they,

1125
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:11,970
they have more testosterone.
They get hornier correct.

1126
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,760
If you just follow,
I'm aging,

1127
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:19,761
uh,
men and women as men who had 

1128
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:21,921
testosterone based age,
they lose their testosterone and they 

1129
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:25,581
have more estrogen.
That's why we become clear stages as we 

1130
00:54:25,581 --> 00:54:29,121
get older.
Women on the other hand lose their 

1131
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:33,020
estrogen and gain more testosterone.
That's why you start seeing facial hair 

1132
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,010
and they start taking the command 
position in the relationship as they get

1133
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:37,560
older.
And it's this flipping of the,

1134
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,790
the hormones.
Hey Doctor Gordon,

1135
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:41,240
I wanted to touch on the a and Joe,
you asked about the,

1136
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:44,370
uh,
able to regrow anything in the brain.

1137
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:46,090
It's called neuroplasticity,
you know,

1138
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,860
right.
Doctor Gordon,

1139
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:51,861
and I wanted to dumb it down for the 
listeners are guys that maybe are like 

1140
00:54:51,861 --> 00:54:51,880
me that are listening,
so are,

1141
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:54,780
are we able to fix our brains?
And Science has said yes.

1142
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:59,781
And I found this out before I met Dr 
Gordon and I was hearing about some of 

1143
00:54:59,781 --> 00:55:03,081
these things and treatments I was at 
about neuroplasticity and basically 

1144
00:55:03,081 --> 00:55:04,830
being able to regenerate the neuronal 
pathways.

1145
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,860
Okay,
so we have shearing a shearing of the 

1146
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,830
neurons and a traumatic brain injury 
and,

1147
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,440
and that's causing some of the issues 
that we have,

1148
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:18,441
but when,
what we now know is we can form new 

1149
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:21,650
neuronal pathways in the brain and we 
can stimulate stimulate that through a 

1150
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:26,121
number of ways.
Learning something that you've never 

1151
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:28,251
learned will stimulate that.
I'm treating it with what you're 

1152
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:29,940
deficient in,
new oral steroids steroid wise.

1153
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,160
We'll fix that.
So we thought like,

1154
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:33,700
can't you,
can you treat a.

1155
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,420
can you teach a old dog new tricks?
We thought the answer was no,

1156
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:41,421
but now we know that that's not correct.
We can regenerate neuronal pathways in 

1157
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,360
the brain.
Anybody can do it,

1158
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,390
and you can keep yourself.
You can continue to get sharper as your 

1159
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:47,390
age through these treatments.

1160
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,110
I think people get sharper to when they 
try new things.

1161
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:52,800
Absolutely.

1162
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,560
That's part of the.
That's part of the science behind.

1163
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:55,080
Okay,
well that,

1164
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:58,160
that builds new neural pathways and we 
didn't think that that was possible.

1165
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,260
I don't know how long we just figured 
that out,

1166
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:03,230
but when I heard that two years ago and 
people were telling me,

1167
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:03,980
hey,
this is the new.

1168
00:56:03,981 --> 00:56:05,630
You just accept it.
And I was like,

1169
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,360
well this is the last class.
I was not told me about neuroplasticity.

1170
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,200
So which one is it can regenerate and 
renew or you can't.

1171
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:17,650
I think it was Fort Collins and a doctor
twilley twilley who was doing just that.

1172
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,860
Introducing two vets who had traumatic 
brain injury,

1173
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:26,861
would nintendo with certain types of 
gains to get the visual manual dexterity

1174
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,700
which would help to improve their 
cognitive ability because of doing just 

1175
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,060
that,
using learning something new.

1176
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,070
Uh,
what's that thing called?

1177
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:37,380
[inaudible].
So Dakota.

1178
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,200
Yeah,
so do Duke,

1179
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:39,880
which,
uh,

1180
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:44,910
forces you to do a intense thinking 
which can help build a new pathways in 

1181
00:56:46,061 --> 00:56:48,700
literature that I used to read in 
Alzheimer's.

1182
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:51,250
I have a lecture on it.
There's,

1183
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:56,350
um,
they found that if you looked at the 

1184
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:56,350
academic,
uh,

1185
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:00,070
the academic experience of an individual
when they get Alzheimer's,

1186
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:02,740
the people have the highest academic 
achievements,

1187
00:57:02,741 --> 00:57:04,600
meaning mds,
phds,

1188
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:08,560
and so forth compared to people who just
have a high school diploma,

1189
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,920
that those people with the higher 
education have a slower progression of 

1190
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,571
Alzheimer's disease.
And that's because they've built 

1191
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:18,571
parallel pathways,
a lot of pathways.

1192
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:23,531
So if you lose this pathway,
you've got this one is an alternative 

1193
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:24,040
backdoor,
backdoor backup side of the door.

1194
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:24,970
Yeah.
So,

1195
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:25,300
you know,

1196
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,690
well,
it also makes sense in relation to 

1197
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:30,690
exercise.
The more exercise that when people don't

1198
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:30,740
actually.
Absolutely.

1199
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,180
They experience atrophy,
right?

1200
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,270
When you know,
when your,

1201
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,900
your,
your life has exact same path every day,

1202
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:39,320
the exact same stimuli.
Nothing varies when that,

1203
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:44,321
when that happens,
it's a very easy for your mind did just 

1204
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:44,450
atrophy your,
you're correct.

1205
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,090
Your process.
You don't challenge yourself in life,

1206
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:52,091
then you're going to atrophy in every 
area so that that's the onus on the 

1207
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:52,091
individual.
You know what I mean?

1208
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:57,670
Yeah.
That's also by people that are sort of 

1209
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:57,670
adrenaline junkies,
they,

1210
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:01,610
they kind of ramp it up all the time.
More and more and more to the other 

1211
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:01,610
people around them.
Like,

1212
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,780
you're fucking getting a little crazy 
here,

1213
00:58:02,781 --> 00:58:04,110
buddy,
but it's because it,

1214
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,400
it takes more for them to get that 
juice.

1215
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,750
Right.
They don't get it from the original.

1216
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,880
Their baseline is pushed higher.
Yeah,

1217
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,230
fine.

1218
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:19,560
You know,
I have patients who get onto a program 

1219
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,530
and after for six months they say,
doc,

1220
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:23,410
I don't feel the same as I did at the 
beginning.

1221
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,280
I said,
well,

1222
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:26,680
at the beginning you were at zero,
now you're at 100.

1223
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,150
We're at the top.
What more?

1224
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:32,650
You've already had that contrast from 
zero to 100 and the analogy I use is,

1225
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:38,060
you know,
it's 100 degrees outside and you've got 

1226
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,651
to pull the.
It's 86 degrees when you jump into the 

1227
00:58:39,651 --> 00:58:42,031
pool,
it's initially cold and then your body 

1228
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:42,031
adapts and you don't feel that 
temperature difference.

1229
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:43,480
Is the temperature any different?
No,

1230
00:58:43,481 --> 00:58:44,860
it's the same thing.
You've adapted.

1231
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:50,220
So what happens is we adapt to not 
feeling the contrast because there's no 

1232
00:58:51,071 --> 00:58:52,540
contrast.
You're already at the top.

1233
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:54,890
Does that make any sense?
Yeah,

1234
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,020
totally makes sense.
Yeah.

1235
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,630
So this is what people have to 
understand and you know,

1236
00:58:58,631 --> 00:59:01,420
every week I get one or two patients,
you know,

1237
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:02,410
call up and say,
doc,

1238
00:59:02,411 --> 00:59:04,300
I just don't feel as good as I did in 
the beginning.

1239
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,880
Have you changed?
Have you dropped in your functionality?

1240
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:07,630
No.
In fact,

1241
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:09,070
I'm going to be running a,
you know,

1242
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:10,040
a marathon.
Well,

1243
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:11,560
were you able to do that last time?
No,

1244
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:16,561
I'm not.
Now I'm in the gym six days a week 

1245
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:16,570
instead of once a week or once a month.
I said,

1246
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,600
your entire lifestyle is updated,
but you're not feeling as good and I 

1247
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,710
just can't get a full understanding.
Their level of function is up here,

1248
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:26,630
but they are telling me that they're not
doing as well.

1249
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:29,780
And is it just because they're just,
they're used to it?

1250
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:33,260
Is that what it is?
It's a massive improvement.

1251
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:35,750
They had in the beginning it was like 
this new state.

1252
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,040
It's almost like getting water in your 
ear and it.

1253
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,590
Yeah.
And then the water comes out.

1254
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:43,580
It's a contrast.
Hormones always give the body a contrast

1255
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:47,360
beef between low level and that higher 
level,

1256
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,580
not excessive but higher level.

1257
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:54,970
And you adapt to it and you think it's.
You know what happens with heroin 

1258
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:54,970
addicts,
it's a bad example,

1259
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,830
but the same thing,
they get what's called techie flax.

1260
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,460
They don't feel the same.
Hi,

1261
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:03,520
everybody chases that first high and 
you're never going to have that first 

1262
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,021
high because that was the first time 
that you just whacked all your neurons 

1263
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,000
in your brain with this new drug.
Heroin or chasing the Dragon,

1264
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:12,290
chasing the dragon.
Correct.

1265
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:13,350
But it makes sense.
I mean,

1266
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:18,370
when something is unique in the,
in the beginning and special and 

1267
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:18,770
fantastic.
He gives you this.

1268
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,350
But then when that's a normal thing,
right?

1269
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,940
Then you go,
you know,

1270
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,210
what worked for me in the beginning and 
then it stopped working for them.

1271
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:27,710
It hasn't changed and you'd show them 
their blood levels,

1272
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:29,450
their blood levels,
like at a,

1273
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:31,470
um,
in fact it was a,

1274
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,630
I think it was Jordan who,
uh,

1275
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,690
was very,
very low in testosterone.

1276
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:39,740
I think it was like a two when it should
be a 14 and his total was like two,

1277
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,800
uh,
220 and should be about 700 and he 

1278
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:50,081
complains that he's not feeling as well.
We did his blood work and his free 

1279
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:51,770
testosterone was like 14,
13 point nine,

1280
01:00:51,771 --> 01:00:55,910
nine in total was 801,
so it was like four times above where he

1281
01:00:55,911 --> 01:01:00,911
was before.
And he's saying he doesn't feel any 

1282
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:00,911
better.
That's crazy.

1283
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:00,911
So he just got used to this elevated 
state.

1284
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,290
He's at functioning at a higher level,
you know,

1285
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,030
I've been on treat happens.
The rich people too,

1286
01:01:05,031 --> 01:01:05,690
right?
Is that right?

1287
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:06,630
Yeah,
that's what they say.

1288
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,350
Using a ball,
you,

1289
01:01:09,351 --> 01:01:12,080
uh,
you start to crave different things,

1290
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:12,530
right?
And,

1291
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:17,531
but the problem with that is we lose 
focus and the clarity of the present 

1292
01:01:17,531 --> 01:01:18,020
moment.
That's the problem,

1293
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:23,021
man.
I crave a different emotion when you 

1294
01:01:23,021 --> 01:01:23,120
need to be experiencing the most that 
you're having right now.

1295
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,240
Living,
living in that part of it.

1296
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:30,410
The problem of being a fucking person is
because we're always striving for the 

1297
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,710
new thing.
We're always striving for improvement.

1298
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:36,980
We always want a better time at our run.
We always want a better this better 

1299
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,740
that.
The newest car,

1300
01:01:37,741 --> 01:01:41,640
the fucking uptight to the house,
all that shit when we're constantly,

1301
01:01:41,641 --> 01:01:43,170
when no one has ever like,
hey,

1302
01:01:43,171 --> 01:01:43,980
that's pretty good.
Yeah.

1303
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,240
I think that apathy,
I think it's chasing certain emotions 

1304
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,940
and trying to run away from other ones 
when,

1305
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:55,990
when there's,
there's opportunity for growth and 

1306
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:57,530
development and ultimately contribution 
and all of them and they're all,

1307
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:02,560
they all can produce that.
If you're able to instead of run from 

1308
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,621
it,
maybe look at it and see what that can 

1309
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:07,241
provide you and what can,
what can you do that to provide that to 

1310
01:02:07,241 --> 01:02:07,241
somebody else.

1311
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:08,220
Yeah.
It makes sense.

1312
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:11,460
Totally makes sense.
It just seems to me that,

1313
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:16,461
um,
the way you approach life and the 

1314
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:19,191
philosophy that you have,
that you take through life can either 

1315
01:02:19,191 --> 01:02:19,950
they can even contribute

1316
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,010
or take away from your happiness and 
that it's,

1317
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,960
it's not,
it's all these things.

1318
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:28,860
It's not just the hormonal balance,
it's not just the health of the physical

1319
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:31,140
body,
but it's also the approach that you have

1320
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:36,141
to live,
the way you look at things can sort of 

1321
01:02:36,141 --> 01:02:36,141
affect and,
and,

1322
01:02:36,141 --> 01:02:38,520
and balance all that stuff out in a way.
Meaning that you need everything.

1323
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:39,070
You need the big

1324
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,360
picture.
Absolutely.

1325
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,840
I think if you wrap your happiness 
around passion or our pleasure,

1326
01:02:43,841 --> 01:02:45,190
those are,
those are fleeting.

1327
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:50,220
You know what I mean?
So if you could been instead wrapping 

1328
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,441
around purpose or meaning,
then you're going to be a longterm 

1329
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:52,441
happy,
uh,

1330
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:53,440
but pleasure,
passion,

1331
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,210
things like that,
that,

1332
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:54,700
that,
that,

1333
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,280
that short term people chasing pleasure,
man.

1334
01:02:57,281 --> 01:02:58,870
And that,
that doesn't make you happy in the end.

1335
01:02:58,990 --> 01:02:59,830
No.
You know,

1336
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:02,420
my friend Steve Reno has a really funny 
way of.

1337
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,010
He talks about things that are really 
fun when you're doing them.

1338
01:03:06,011 --> 01:03:08,620
And then things are that are really fun 
after they're done,

1339
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:14,090
he's like,
some things are really fun while you're 

1340
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:14,090
doing them,
but after they're done,

1341
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:17,161
they don't give you any.
Like a rollercoaster rollercoaster 

1342
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:17,161
doesn't give you anything after it's 
over.

1343
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:19,180
But like there's some miserable trips 
that you go on.

1344
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:24,420
Well afterwards,
just spend hours and hours laugh with 

1345
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:24,420
your friends.
Like,

1346
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:24,420
dude,
that sucks so hard.

1347
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,880
Absolutely.
He'd be laughing about how fucking cold 

1348
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,530
you were and you're camping and you're 
freezing your dick off.

1349
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,690
We want to blow my nose.
But you know,

1350
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:39,190
remembering a perceived negative time 
and putting a positive light on it.

1351
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:39,890
You know what I mean?
Absolutely.

1352
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:45,190
It's also understanding that a lot of 
like what is good is very difficult to 

1353
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:50,531
do and it becomes like your goal setting
and then achieving those goals becomes 

1354
01:03:51,321 --> 01:03:56,321
this,
this feeling of of pleasure and a good 

1355
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:59,021
thing.
Whereas opposed to so many people just 

1356
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:01,511
want comfort and quiet and peace,
but with none of the hard work and that 

1357
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:06,470
you don't appreciate it then absolutely.
You like a spoiled child,

1358
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:10,820
like spoiled kids don't appreciate what 
they have in their life.

1359
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,630
Somebody works really hard and you know 
they've gone through hard times.

1360
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,610
Then when things turned well,
they're like,

1361
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:21,611
God,
this is so good to not have to worry 

1362
01:04:21,611 --> 01:04:21,611
about money now,
to not have to worry about where my next

1363
01:04:21,611 --> 01:04:26,081
meal's coming from,
to have a nice home and a nice bed to 

1364
01:04:26,081 --> 01:04:26,081
sleep in.

1365
01:04:26,081 --> 01:04:30,530
Yeah.
If you look at the Richard Bransons and 

1366
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:31,810
the job's and so forth that came from 
nothing and they built something.

1367
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:36,940
They worked.
They were hungry and develop something 

1368
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,080
or had a world that was fulfilled.
Everything that they could think of a 

1369
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:44,380
they had the desire to achieve that goal
as opposed to people who are given 

1370
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,870
everything on a silver platter.
They don't have aspirations.

1371
01:04:46,871 --> 01:04:50,020
They don't have the drive.
I think you achieved that goal.

1372
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:52,000
That is kind of pleasure.
You're talking about Joe,

1373
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:57,001
but like the we look back and look at 
the journey that it took from where you 

1374
01:04:57,001 --> 01:04:58,850
started to get to that goal.
That's where you can feel purposeful and

1375
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:03,930
proud of proud of it.
That last longer than the feeling of 

1376
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:03,930
accomplishing that goal.
The journey.

1377
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,770
Yeah.
It's what a weird world we live in,

1378
01:05:06,771 --> 01:05:07,390
isn't it,
you know,

1379
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,000
trying to manage all this stuff and 
trying to figure out what,

1380
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:15,040
what's the most,
what's the optimum way to get through 

1381
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,550
life,
what's the best way to approach it,

1382
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,100
how much emphasis to put

1383
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,070
on the mind,
how much emphasis to put on the body,

1384
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:25,540
the relationships that you have with the
people in your life greatly affect how,

1385
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:30,010
how you feel about life in the people in
your life could,

1386
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,750
they,
can affect your hormone levels.

1387
01:05:31,751 --> 01:05:34,300
They can affect your,
your cortisol levels.

1388
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:38,830
They can affect all those things.
He has his daughter having a,

1389
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,400
you know,
someone said that I talk a lot and I 

1390
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,220
tell them that because of having four 
women in home,

1391
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:48,040
three daughters and a wife,
that the uh,

1392
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,970
Opportunity that I have to speak is 
always outside because inside the house,

1393
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:53,500
you know,
he just listened.

1394
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,560
I just listened.
Just trying to sort out these aliens 

1395
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,530
that you live with and other especially 
matched you.

1396
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:02,260
I got three daughters.
I have two on the same package.

1397
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:03,610
Yeah.
I also got two boys,

1398
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:05,800
so commiserate later.
Full House.

1399
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:06,700
You got chaos.

1400
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,800
That's how we live,
like I said,

1401
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:11,320
in feces,
urine and nonstop,

1402
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:18,210
but as they get older,
they mature into this delight as my 

1403
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:19,900
daughter over there and the other two 
daughters that are in here.

1404
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,440
Just a delight and that journey you were
talking about and the effect of the 

1405
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,520
environment on your psychological 
wellbeing.

1406
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:28,140
You know,
it's a.

1407
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:31,420
it's a rollercoaster that I've gone 
through a rollercoaster with each one of

1408
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:34,150
the daughters and I've come to that 
landing.

1409
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:39,660
You know,
where you get off the rollercoaster 

1410
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,640
finally at this age and you look back 
and you start laughing on some of the 

1411
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,841
silly things that happened and my 
daughter came to me a couple of weeks 

1412
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,830
ago and basically said,
yeah,

1413
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:50,560
we went through some silly time.
Let's have some great time.

1414
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:55,000
And it was one of the most revelator ing
kind of nights I could have had.

1415
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,760
It was the best night and going out and 
having a good,

1416
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,800
you know,
40 year old scotch or something.

1417
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,100
But you owe me that.
This,

1418
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:06,180
this last year,
I read a Victor Frankel's man's search 

1419
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:09,361
for meaning and it just changed my 
outlook on everything and he went 

1420
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:13,561
through the Holocaust and that basically
the book was the premise of some people 

1421
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:15,580
survived the Holocaust and they like the
Holocaust.

1422
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:21,610
That's the text,
that's a text and then me Holocaust.

1423
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,550
Some people survived,
right,

1424
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:29,551
and we're able able to to have meaning 
while others just gave up and died and 

1425
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,580
what was.
What was the reasoning behind that?

1426
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:38,581
Was kind of how the book looked at it 
and it was the people who survived that 

1427
01:07:38,581 --> 01:07:41,080
nine percent was the commonality was 
his.

1428
01:07:41,081 --> 01:07:43,210
Everybody had some kind of a meaning,
right?

1429
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:48,240
Some somebody has some kind of purpose 
outside of themselves that was wrapped 

1430
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,740
in a how they could better,
better somebody else's life in some form

1431
01:07:50,741 --> 01:07:55,300
or fashion and that purpose,
that meaning to their life allow them to

1432
01:07:55,301 --> 01:07:58,960
be able to endure whatever came their 
way because they had a purpose to endure

1433
01:07:58,961 --> 01:08:03,961
it.
The person that didn't have a meaning a 

1434
01:08:03,961 --> 01:08:05,200
put on their life for whatever reason,
just at the end,

1435
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:06,760
that was too much.
They just gave in and said,

1436
01:08:06,761 --> 01:08:09,730
I give up and eventually died and that 
was the difference.

1437
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:14,820
You know what I mean?
And we can replicate that in our own 

1438
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,711
life.
I mean you can wrap your life around 

1439
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:16,711
meaning and purpose and

1440
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:20,030
tie that to how you can contribute to,
to put value into somebody else's life.

1441
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,940
I found that puts value into you.
You know what I mean?

1442
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:23,990
So I think the,
you know,

1443
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:25,910
the purpose of life is to live a life of
purpose.

1444
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:29,630
That's a very good way of putting it and
it makes you feel better about your life

1445
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:31,250
too.
And like cynical people will say,

1446
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:32,990
well,
there is no purpose in the end.

1447
01:08:32,991 --> 01:08:37,991
You know,
you're going to take a dirt nap and 

1448
01:08:37,991 --> 01:08:37,991
that's all the time that you have here 
is just bullshit.

1449
01:08:37,991 --> 01:08:42,220
But the reality is that bullshit is way 
better when you believe that you have a 

1450
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:46,721
purpose and when you live for a purpose 
and when you work hard and you achieve 

1451
01:08:46,721 --> 01:08:50,381
things like goal setting,
they say that one of the most important 

1452
01:08:50,381 --> 01:08:53,290
things for people to achieve happiness 
is this setting and achieving of goals.

1453
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:58,550
It's setting and achieving of goals,
whether it's simple like completing a 

1454
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:58,910
project,
I want to start a garden in my yard,

1455
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:03,911
you know,
and you want to put up posts and grow 

1456
01:09:03,911 --> 01:09:03,911
plants and then when you eat a salad 
from those plants you go,

1457
01:09:03,911 --> 01:09:05,510
I fucking did it.
Like you get a feeling,

1458
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,570
a natural feeling of accomplishment from
an art project,

1459
01:09:08,571 --> 01:09:10,840
from anything you want to do,
fixing the shed,

1460
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:11,720
what,
whatever it is.

1461
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:15,080
Like when you set a goal and you do your
best and you achieve.

1462
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:19,970
That's part of what made human beings 
what we are today in 2015.

1463
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:24,971
Those,
those natural reward systems are in our 

1464
01:09:24,971 --> 01:09:27,461
DNA.
And if you follow those and you live by 

1465
01:09:27,461 --> 01:09:28,190
those,
you will have a more fulfilled life,

1466
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,290
a happier life.
I agree.

1467
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,060
I agree.
And it's,

1468
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:37,270
it's a fulfillment.
It's a joy that you get that you don't 

1469
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:41,321
have need anybody else to say to you,
good job [inaudible] because it's self 

1470
01:09:41,321 --> 01:09:41,321
generated.

1471
01:09:41,321 --> 01:09:45,680
It's your own self reward as opposed to 
people's search for other ones.

1472
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,930
Someone else to tap them on the back.
You know,

1473
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:52,931
people come up to me and you know,
I'm very sensitive about the fact that 

1474
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:56,771
people say,
what a great job I'm doing whatever I'm 

1475
01:09:56,771 --> 01:09:59,141
doing,
I know I'm doing a good job because 

1476
01:09:59,141 --> 01:09:59,141
that's my purpose.
That's my purpose.

1477
01:09:59,141 --> 01:10:01,100
I don't need to have someone to tell me 
to,

1478
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:02,660
you know,
I've been doing a good job.

1479
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,540
You're not a slack.
Like if you weren't doing your best,

1480
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:07,060
you'd be,
you'd be going against yourself.

1481
01:10:07,061 --> 01:10:12,061
Right?
So you don't need anybody very 

1482
01:10:12,061 --> 01:10:12,061
hypercritical about myself because you 
know,

1483
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:17,350
you look around the planet,
how many people are putting in effort 

1484
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:21,461
for helping other people?
I mean really truly helping without 

1485
01:10:21,461 --> 01:10:26,200
helping them.
Not that I do 100 percent because I'm 

1486
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,881
selfish.
I need to have my couch in my car and 

1487
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:28,881
whatever else.

1488
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:31,970
Trying to improve wellbeing,
improved wellbeing across the board.

1489
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:38,030
Yeah.
There's really no good manual on how to 

1490
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:38,960
live life.
And even if there was,

1491
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:41,180
it might not apply to you,
you know?

1492
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,760
I mean,
nobody can tell you what's going to make

1493
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:48,761
one person happy.
It's not necessarily gonna make another 

1494
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:48,761
person happy.
You know,

1495
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:52,390
we're,
we're here talking about goal setting 

1496
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,390
and working hard and trying for some 
people,

1497
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:55,490
that's actually not it for some,
for some people,

1498
01:10:55,610 --> 01:11:00,610
what do they want to do?
They just want to have a good group of 

1499
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:02,471
friends and be around them and have nice
meals and good conversations and that's 

1500
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:07,271
it.
They literally don't have a desire for 

1501
01:11:07,271 --> 01:11:09,941
these other things.
But for people like you that have this 

1502
01:11:09,941 --> 01:11:12,701
burning desire to know things and 
improve upon things and to do good work 

1503
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:13,730
for,
that's

1504
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,000
your path.
That's it.

1505
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,360
I think some people just get so wrapped 
up in the day to day rat race of life 

1506
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,540
that they don't put the pick their head 
up and say,

1507
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,070
man,
I,

1508
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:22,650
I,
I,

1509
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,680
I'm totally missing the boat.
And there,

1510
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:30,700
there is no meaning.
There is no purpose to how I'm doing 

1511
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,141
anything.
I would think people really thought 

1512
01:11:33,141 --> 01:11:33,141
about it.
They might not be do what I,

1513
01:11:33,141 --> 01:11:37,490
you know,
Joe Rogan Westview or Mark Gordon wants 

1514
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:37,490
to do,
but they're,

1515
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:37,490
they're going to like,
hey,

1516
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,160
I want to do something.
If it's not just tied around,

1517
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,090
totally doing,
you know,

1518
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:42,450
I just want to hang out and not give 
anything out to anybody.

1519
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:47,630
You're not gonna get anything in return.
I don't think anybody wants to do that 

1520
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:47,630
and in their right mind,
you know,

1521
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:52,130
it's so hard for people to find out what
it is that they want to do and then how 

1522
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:56,991
do I go about pursuing that and how do I
go about pursuing that while avoiding 

1523
01:11:56,991 --> 01:12:00,810
the idea of choosing just a job that's 
going to give you security,

1524
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,640
you know,
a job that you don't want to do,

1525
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:07,641
but hey,
you know it's going to give me dental 

1526
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:07,641
there.
That's a.

1527
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:07,641
that's a big factor in a lot of people's
lives.

1528
01:12:07,641 --> 01:12:11,790
The non pursuing of dreams that somehow 
and you to go streams or danger,

1529
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,700
you got to go after it with your,
with no fear of failure.

1530
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:19,780
If that didn't,
don't even let failure enter into the 

1531
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,801
equation.
What would you do if you knew you 

1532
01:12:21,801 --> 01:12:21,801
couldn't fail at it?
That's what I would tell people to do.

1533
01:12:21,801 --> 01:12:22,680
That's what I tell my kids.
Whatever you're passionate about,

1534
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,780
that's where you need to start.
You know what I mean?

1535
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,640
That's where you need to go and get 
dental.

1536
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,000
You're going to have failure.
But failure is important for growth and 

1537
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,000
learning.
Uh,

1538
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,760
you know,
I have it all the time.

1539
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:33,150
It's,
it's,

1540
01:12:33,151 --> 01:12:34,080
it's,
it's good.

1541
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:35,970
It's like a vitamin.
You gotta take it,

1542
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:39,060
fill fuel yourself with the fuck up.
So that's what I always say,

1543
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:44,130
talking about failure.
One of the stories I keep on repeating 

1544
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:49,230
and using as a goal for myself is it was
a reporter that interviewed Thomas 

1545
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,480
Jefferson,
Thomas Jefferson,

1546
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:54,040
Thomas Edison,
before he passed away.

1547
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,470
And he said to him,
you know,

1548
01:12:55,570 --> 01:13:00,570
Mr Edison and your development of the 
incandescent bulb was what revolution I 

1549
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:03,940
took us from the stone ages to modern 
living and you know,

1550
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:06,820
but how do you feel about these over 
1,108

1551
01:13:06,821 --> 01:13:09,610
failures that they said that you had 
with the bulbs?

1552
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,340
And Thomas Edison says,
well,

1553
01:13:12,341 --> 01:13:15,070
sunny,
I don't look at them as being failures,

1554
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,720
justice,
things that didn't work.

1555
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:22,230
And it's by having that attitude of 
looking at what we do in our daily life 

1556
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,190
is not failures.
Meaning that you're worthless and you're

1557
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,530
incapable and therefore you should stop 
what you're doing,

1558
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:28,540
but look at it.
It's just something that didn't work.

1559
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,190
Find another pathway.

1560
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:31,250
The data.
Great.

1561
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:32,840
Thomas Edison impression,
by the way,

1562
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:36,770
you very much is a southern.
When did he become from Alabama?

1563
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:39,230
Where was he called?
The Ohio.

1564
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:40,430
Well,
not only that,

1565
01:13:40,431 --> 01:13:41,780
he ripped off Tesla,
me know.

1566
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,700
That was really how he got ahead.
That guy was just.

1567
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,650
He hated the alternate current lecture,
shooting fucking elephants and shit.

1568
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,880
DC.
Remember that?

1569
01:13:49,881 --> 01:13:51,680
He liked you,
but that Alpha is all about direct.

1570
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:52,730
Current.
Yeah.

1571
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,710
He fucked up.
That was a dumb ass.

1572
01:13:55,130 --> 01:14:00,130
It was just lucky.
There was a super genius around that he 

1573
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:00,130
could steal from.
Well,

1574
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:01,130
I'm sure he was smart.
Yeah,

1575
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,830
don't get me wrong,
but we kind of helped.

1576
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:09,190
Helped being around Tesla.
I mean that's that Michael Jordan 

1577
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:09,190
commercial,
you know,

1578
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:10,400
like about how many times you've failed,
failed over and over and over again,

1579
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:12,340
and that's why it's succeeded.
Like he said,

1580
01:14:12,341 --> 01:14:13,130
man,
it makes that,

1581
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,440
that spurs growth.

1582
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:16,090
You know,
you have to be able to fail.

1583
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,650
I look at it as data,
you know what I mean?

1584
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,650
That just,
that gives me readings about where I was

1585
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:23,110
and how I need to self correct the 
course I'm at.

1586
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:28,470
Without it,
you can't get a good true measurement 

1587
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:28,570
and that feeling that you get from 
failure is awesome.

1588
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:33,870
It sucks at the time,
but it's like the like we were talking 

1589
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:37,711
about things that are fun while you're 
doing them and then things that are 

1590
01:14:37,711 --> 01:14:39,610
great years later,
when you fail at something,

1591
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:42,820
that feeling that you have afterwards,
it's fucking horrible,

1592
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,120
but that feeling will fuel you.
That feeling will get you to avoid that,

1593
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:54,181
so that's what it's there for,
but you got to rearrange the way you 

1594
01:14:54,181 --> 01:14:54,181
look at it.
People look at it like,

1595
01:14:54,181 --> 01:14:55,120
Oh,
I'm a failure.

1596
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,640
You can't define yourself by mistakes.

1597
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,360
You what you who you are is you are the 
thinking thing.

1598
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:04,870
You are the thing that can figure out 
what the problem is,

1599
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:06,820
how to,
how to form a solution.

1600
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
You're not the results like you're not 
the failures and that's what a lot of 

1601
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,351
people run into.
They define themselves by failures and 

1602
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,790
people try to define you by failures,
like how many times you run into someone

1603
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:23,791
from higher.
Remember that time when you're in high 

1604
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:23,791
school,
you did this.

1605
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:23,791
Not like,
Hey Dickhead,

1606
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:24,250
that was 20 years ago.
You're still living there.

1607
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,650
You know,
I learned from that and I moved past it.

1608
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:28,420
That happens with a lot of people,
right?

1609
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,350
That people will try to drag you into.
Like I had a friend of mine who,

1610
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:33,380
uh,
he had to get up.

1611
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,460
He had a breakup with this girl because 
he was dating her.

1612
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,640
When they would talk about things,
they would have a disagreement about 

1613
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,341
something that she did and she would 
bring up something that happened like 

1614
01:15:44,341 --> 01:15:44,860
fucking two years ago that had nothing 
to do with it.

1615
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:47,890
Like you did they give you.
And then you said that he was like,

1616
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,620
it was too fucking years ago.
What do you,

1617
01:15:49,621 --> 01:15:53,230
what are you talking about?
Has No bearing on who we are right now?

1618
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:54,490
None.
Zero.

1619
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,720
She's not being rational.
You.

1620
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:58,620
She was trying to define him by,
uh,

1621
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:00,760
an argument that they had,
you know,

1622
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:05,850
two years ago or whatever comments like,
you know what I mean when people are 

1623
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,190
doing that,
they're trying to define them based on a

1624
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:11,020
failure as a team guy,
man,

1625
01:16:11,021 --> 01:16:15,460
anybody on the guy I want on my team is 
a guy who's failed and failed and failed

1626
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:17,230
and every time he got back up and he 
said,

1627
01:16:17,231 --> 01:16:18,370
I don't,
I don't give a shit.

1628
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,170
I'm going to keep going because I know 
when,

1629
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:23,050
when the bullets start flying and the 
day gets tough,

1630
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:26,680
we're going to keep moving.
Show me somebody who's never failed ours

1631
01:16:26,681 --> 01:16:27,550
one every time.

1632
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:32,050
And as soon as they have a perceived 
adversity or difficult situation,

1633
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:34,720
they don't know how to act.
I don't want that guy on my team,

1634
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:36,590
especially when it's life and death.
You know what?

1635
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,400
That's a big issue with fighters.
Yeah,

1636
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,270
with fighters,
that's a giant issue.

1637
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:43,270
It's called being a front runner and 
there's some guys that just,

1638
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,000
they don't do well when they're the the 
nail.

1639
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:51,001
They're great when they're the hammer,
but when then all of a sudden they're 

1640
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:53,671
the nail.
They don't know what the fuck to do and 

1641
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:55,201
they fall apart.
There's certain guys that if they're 

1642
01:16:55,201 --> 01:16:55,201
dominating a fight to the most 
terrifying fighter in the world,

1643
01:16:55,201 --> 01:16:58,110
but the moment things start going the 
way you start seeing cracks in their arm

1644
01:16:58,111 --> 01:17:03,111
or you start seeing mental weaknesses 
and they fold and they perform at a 

1645
01:17:03,111 --> 01:17:04,990
drastically reduced level with no 
reason,

1646
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:08,080
well the reason it's psychological,
all of a sudden they're confronting it.

1647
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,660
Adversity.
They're confronted,

1648
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:14,670
they don't know what to do,
and then when you see a fighter that's 

1649
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:17,321
able to cable,
able capable of being hurt and on the 

1650
01:17:17,321 --> 01:17:19,100
brink of failure and then coming back 
and winning a fight,

1651
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:24,250
then you see a person with character and
then there's other people that they're 

1652
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:27,050
great when everything's going their way,
but the moment things aren't going their

1653
01:17:27,051 --> 01:17:29,480
way.
They just fucking pack up their bags and

1654
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:34,481
go home.
That's what I love to watch is the guy 

1655
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:35,210
that those fights were.
The guy was down and he didn't.

1656
01:17:35,211 --> 01:17:38,480
He didn't stop pain.
You learn a lot about God.

1657
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,210
You said Joe,
their character.

1658
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:43,370
That's where he learned about somebody's
character is this kid that fights in the

1659
01:17:43,371 --> 01:17:45,670
UFC right now.
His name is Thomas Almeda is very,

1660
01:17:45,671 --> 01:17:50,671
very,
very highly hyped up fighter and he had 

1661
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:51,740
a real tough fight recently with this 
guy named Brad picket.

1662
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,550
Brad pickets,
a tough veterans.

1663
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:58,580
Been around for a long time.
This kid I'll made has been beating 

1664
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:01,031
everybody up and then all of a sudden he
gets in this fight with his veteran and 

1665
01:18:01,031 --> 01:18:01,310
he gets cracked.
His nose gets broken.

1666
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:06,311
He gets rocked really hard,
came back the next round and knocked 

1667
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:06,311
out,
knocked pick it out.

1668
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:07,820
It hit him with a flying knee and 
knocked him out.

1669
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:10,820
But the point being that this kid got 
pushed to the brink,

1670
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:14,210
never lost composure,
and then you go,

1671
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:16,400
okay,
the hypes real this kids a real deal,

1672
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:21,880
and you got to see that.
You've got to see that to know because 

1673
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:21,890
otherwise you don't know what happens 
when they get in trouble.

1674
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:26,950
Absolutely getting in trouble,
like being able to operate while under 

1675
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:29,180
that kind of intense pressure of being 
in trouble is what makes champions,

1676
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,600
hey,
how do you replicate that in the fight 

1677
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,341
world and and training for a guy to be 
able to be in that situation to where,

1678
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:41,380
hey,
this is what's going to feel like and 

1679
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:41,380
this is how you need to respond or can 
you replicate that?

1680
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:41,810
You almost can't.
I mean,

1681
01:18:41,811 --> 01:18:43,730
I think that that kind of mental 
training,

1682
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,260
it's,
it's,

1683
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,580
it's so difficult to try to replicate 
that.

1684
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,460
There's certain drills you can do like 
you do.

1685
01:18:49,461 --> 01:18:54,461
I'm a drill.
We take five fresh guys and you go in 

1686
01:18:54,461 --> 01:18:58,091
and you spar one guy for one round and 
then that guy goes out and you bring a 

1687
01:18:58,091 --> 01:18:59,040
new fresh guy and you're tired.
That guys,

1688
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:00,560
they,
they try to break you.

1689
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:02,840
They try,
but there's also people that don't agree

1690
01:19:02,841 --> 01:19:07,841
with that because they think that that 
kind of like experiencing failure like 

1691
01:19:07,841 --> 01:19:11,300
that in the gym is actually a bad thing 
because then you become comfortable with

1692
01:19:11,301 --> 01:19:15,440
failure and you understand it and some 
people think that it's just an attribute

1693
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:20,500
that's a psychological attribute.
Either you're in shape and you're 

1694
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,471
prepared and you're ready and when 
adversity comes you're going to be able 

1695
01:19:23,471 --> 01:19:23,471
to handle it or you're not.

1696
01:19:23,471 --> 01:19:23,810
You know,
it's,

1697
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:28,811
it's,
it's really tough to put an answer to 

1698
01:19:28,811 --> 01:19:31,391
that because it's really tough.
Like think about like buds training or 

1699
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:34,220
think about like how many people go 
through that,

1700
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:39,280
that kind of training and just get to 
the point where everybody's 

1701
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,190
uncomfortable,
everybody's miserable,

1702
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:42,920
but they get up and they quit and who 
doesn't quit?

1703
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:44,820
The people that don't quit at the people
that you're going to count on,

1704
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:45,980
like why?
Why,

1705
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:51,130
why this is their first time doing 
because they made the decision 

1706
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:54,130
beforehand.
I can tell you they made the decision 

1707
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:56,030
beforehand like I don't care what 
happens and how much it's going to suck.

1708
01:19:56,180 --> 01:20:01,180
In my mind.
I have now embraced it and I've told 

1709
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:01,180
myself that I'm an enjoy it and no 
matter what,

1710
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:04,070
I'm not quitting it.
I'll lose a leg before I quit,

1711
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:09,000
but if you have even the slightest 
inkling of this sucks,

1712
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:12,930
I can't believe I have to do another 20 
miles and hump 100 pounds.

1713
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:16,530
Then you're thinking it's easy to step 
off to the side over there and be done,

1714
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:19,440
but if you have a mental mind frame and 
you can train it,

1715
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:23,830
if you had that mental mind frame of I 
will not they they're,

1716
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,840
they might not take me,
but it won't be because I didn't finish 

1717
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,911
this damn thing.
It won't be because I'm not physically 

1718
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:32,400
and mentally here doing everything 
that's asked of me.

1719
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,140
Well,
when you say you can train it,

1720
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,510
they don't try to trade it in you though
before they prepare you?

1721
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,500
No,
absolutely not.

1722
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:39,060
They want the person who does it on 
their own.

1723
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,280
Innate.
I think it's the same with fighters.

1724
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,180
Yeah,
I really do.

1725
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,590
Either you have it or you don't.
Yeah,

1726
01:20:43,591 --> 01:20:48,591
and that's why similarly,
there's just a small percentage of 

1727
01:20:48,591 --> 01:20:50,070
people that ever get through that kind 
of training.

1728
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:55,730
There's similarly a small percentage of 
people that ever get to the elite level 

1729
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:55,730
of competition.

1730
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:57,780
I think in any form,
in any sport,

1731
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:00,240
in anything where you're trying to push 
yourself,

1732
01:21:00,241 --> 01:21:03,240
anything that's difficult,
not really difficult.

1733
01:21:03,241 --> 01:21:04,830
Endeavor reveals character.
Yeah,

1734
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:07,150
it's beautiful.
It's a beautiful process is,

1735
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,620
it's amazing and it's amazing to see in 
yourself and even,

1736
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:12,160
you know,
the people that experience it would,

1737
01:21:12,161 --> 01:21:15,350
they quit even that can be a lesson,
you know,

1738
01:21:15,351 --> 01:21:17,870
you can learn from that lesson and 
rebuild and,

1739
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,130
and never,
never experienced that.

1740
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:22,920
Again,
have a curiosity in your training.

1741
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,560
What percentage of people actually 
complete the training?

1742
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:31,760
Um,
so through our initial special forces 

1743
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,540
assessment and selection,
only about 33 percent get through that.

1744
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:34,350
Then you go through the training 
pipeline,

1745
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,120
which is anymore for about a year and a 
half to two,

1746
01:21:36,121 --> 01:21:41,121
two and a half years.
And that's about 50 percent of the 

1747
01:21:41,121 --> 01:21:41,121
people I think,
you know,

1748
01:21:41,121 --> 01:21:41,690
so you get 16 percent will get through.
It's,

1749
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:46,700
yeah,
it's a very small percentage and that's 

1750
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:46,700
people that have the courage to join.

1751
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:47,390
Right.
So you know,

1752
01:21:47,391 --> 01:21:49,680
you think about how many people were 
willing to sign up.

1753
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:54,681
I mean that's a small percentage to,
so a small percentage of a small 

1754
01:21:54,681 --> 01:21:58,131
percentage of a small percentage.
Everybody wants to be a cool guy and 

1755
01:21:58,131 --> 01:21:58,780
until things go wrong,
oh yeah,

1756
01:21:58,781 --> 01:22:03,781
man,
nobody wants to be anymore what it is 

1757
01:22:03,781 --> 01:22:03,781
with the seals.
And so it's,

1758
01:22:03,781 --> 01:22:04,170
it's,
it's very similar.

1759
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:05,100
Similar to it.
Yeah.

1760
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,200
It's kind of be,
it's almost all very,

1761
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:11,070
very small percentage.
So the question is if it's 16 percent in

1762
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:13,980
that arena,
what is it in,

1763
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,580
in,
in boxing,

1764
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,900
MMA or fighting mma?
There's also,

1765
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:21,630
there's a lot of physical gifts that 
come into play.

1766
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:26,750
Like we're talking about guys that quit,
there's guys that quit that are at the 

1767
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,410
elite level and they just,
they just don't run into anybody as good

1768
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:30,410
as them.
And as long as they keep training,

1769
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,890
they keep pushing ahead,
they'll,

1770
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,560
they'll bulldoze and bum rush.

1771
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,240
All these guys that are in there with 
them.

1772
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:37,800
But there's guys,
you know,

1773
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:40,140
I don't want to mention names,
I don't wanna hurt anybody's feelings.

1774
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:42,270
This guys have won world titles that are
quitters.

1775
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:43,590
Yeah,
it's a fact.

1776
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:46,080
They're just really good or they've been
cheating.

1777
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:49,500
It's been a lot of steroid use epo,
a lot of different things.

1778
01:22:49,501 --> 01:22:51,870
But even then they have to fine tune 
those skills.

1779
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,230
I mean,
any anybody can do,

1780
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,520
do those drugs and they can't hit a home
run or they can't put somebody in a rear

1781
01:22:56,521 --> 01:22:59,040
naked choke.
They're not entirely week.

1782
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,480
See,
you know,

1783
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:01,560
they might,
they might.

1784
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:04,410
Like,
some people can run a marathon,

1785
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:08,410
can run an ultra marathon.
Can you do 100 miles in 24 hours?

1786
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:11,140
A lot of people can't,
but some people can.

1787
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:13,630
So the people that run that ultra 
marathon,

1788
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:15,490
they'll look at other people that can't 
run a marathon.

1789
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:20,520
Or the people that run a regular 
marathon will look at people that can't 

1790
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,281
run a marathon,
that will quit at Mile Sixteen or 

1791
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:23,281
whatever.
And they'll go,

1792
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:26,941
wow,
you just fucking don't have the mental 

1793
01:23:26,941 --> 01:23:28,561
toughness.
Maybe they don't have the mental 

1794
01:23:28,561 --> 01:23:30,511
toughness to go 100 miles.
There's levels to everything in this 

1795
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:34,030
life and there's people that are at the 
elite level of MMA that I know.

1796
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,240
I know that if they get in a bad spot,
they're going to quit.

1797
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:40,390
They're going to breaking point.
I can tell you that for a fact.

1798
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,560
Every,
every,

1799
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:44,050
every human has a breaking point,
so there's no.

1800
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:46,090
There's no unbreakable dude walking 
around today.

1801
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:47,680
No.
Even though he my thanks.

1802
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:49,270
So yeah,
a lot of people think so.

1803
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:53,140
A lot of people think so without ever 
being tested and I don't even think they

1804
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:58,141
think it.
I think they're just saying it so that 

1805
01:23:58,141 --> 01:24:00,001
they think that they can convince you 
and maybe somehow know that will 

1806
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:00,200
convince themselves if you believe it.

1807
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,920
Yeah.
Is it nurture?

1808
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:04,960
Is it nature?
Is it just good question?

1809
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:10,110
What they want to do?
Is it a psychological decision to do it 

1810
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:12,310
or is it their matrix of how they're put
together?

1811
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,300
This is the limit of their capacity.
I had this puppy,

1812
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:18,310
and this is obviously a dog,
another person,

1813
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,750
but I had this dog.
His name was Frank Sinatra.

1814
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:23,050
Craziest fucking dog I've ever had who's
nuts.

1815
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:25,960
His mother was a wild boar hunting dog 
from Hawaii.

1816
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:28,900
His dog was fucking crazy.
He was crazy.

1817
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,550
But uh,
when he was a puppy,

1818
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:32,380
one of the reasons I realized he was 
crazy.

1819
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:37,381
He was a,
he would always like to play bite and 

1820
01:24:37,381 --> 01:24:37,381
stuff.
He was really little.

1821
01:24:37,381 --> 01:24:37,570
It was only two months old.
I,

1822
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:37,890
uh,
you know,

1823
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:42,900
he would come up to me and bite my hands
and I'd push him away and he'd run up a 

1824
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,510
bite my hand again and I pushed him away
and I'm like,

1825
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,800
how many fucking times can I do this?

1826
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,730
I pushed him away 80 times before I got 
tired of doing it.

1827
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:49,910
I go,
one,

1828
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,920
two,
three,

1829
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,620
four.
I'm a fucking human.

1830
01:24:56,621 --> 01:25:01,621
Okay.
I'm a grown man and he's a baby dog and 

1831
01:25:01,621 --> 01:25:03,040
I'm pushing him away from me and he 
never got discouraged.

1832
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,590
Not once at,
at number 80.

1833
01:25:05,591 --> 01:25:06,370
I'm like,
all right buddy,

1834
01:25:06,371 --> 01:25:07,450
bye my hand.
Let's just,

1835
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,570
let's just call this a lot.
But like,

1836
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:14,630
that was 100 percent nature,
not nurture and dog that I've taught 

1837
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:18,090
them to do is get pat and given dog 
food,

1838
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:23,130
give him kisses.
But in his hitting his makeup and 

1839
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:24,640
there's that question of epigenetics,
like what,

1840
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:28,690
how much of your character do you get 
from your parents?

1841
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,170
Like just in your DNA,
how much can you mold on your own?

1842
01:25:32,171 --> 01:25:33,460
I mean,
I think there are.

1843
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,260
There's an untold number of variables 
and nature and nurture.

1844
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:40,780
It's neither or it's all the above.

1845
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:45,780
Absolutely environment.
There's so many different things that 

1846
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:45,780
are.
So,

1847
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:45,780
you know,
you can't really,

1848
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,350
you know,
put these people down for not being able

1849
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:49,710
to succeed at the level that you've like
to.

1850
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:52,450
You did with this super marathon or the 
marathon reimbursement.

1851
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:54,730
It does.
Like I do a five k and I'm wasted.

1852
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:59,350
I'm not a runner or a swimmer.
But if you decided you were a runner and

1853
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:04,351
then put in the work,
you would be a runner given any mean 

1854
01:26:04,351 --> 01:26:06,890
whether your knees hold up or ankle 
problems or all that jazz.

1855
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,160
If you decided to,
you can do.

1856
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:10,610
It's not outside the realm of 
possibility.

1857
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:12,410
It's not like you can't fly.
Well,

1858
01:26:12,411 --> 01:26:13,730
I can't fly either.
You know,

1859
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:15,230
I don't have wings.
You know what I mean?

1860
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,750
Like we're talking about nonphysical 
limitations.

1861
01:26:17,751 --> 01:26:19,730
It's a simple thing like running,
not saying,

1862
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:24,731
well,
you beat Usain bolt in a hundred yard 

1863
01:26:24,731 --> 01:26:24,731
dash.
No you won't,

1864
01:26:24,731 --> 01:26:27,760
you know,
but we're talking about some simple 

1865
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,771
stuff,
making the commitment to do it and keep 

1866
01:26:29,771 --> 01:26:31,860
it and just keep them commitment and you
have the physical and mental capacity 

1867
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:35,501
and then just whether you're going to be
committed and whether or not you're 

1868
01:26:35,501 --> 01:26:35,501
going to embrace the suck.
I've been committed before.

1869
01:26:35,501 --> 01:26:36,870
That's the difference,
Joe,

1870
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:38,880
instead of turning from whatever you're 
doing,

1871
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:39,750
embrace it,
man.

1872
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:42,360
You have to truly embrace it.
Embrace the suck.

1873
01:26:42,361 --> 01:26:44,270
Then it's not something that you're 
trying to get out of you.

1874
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:45,610
You're trying to live in that moment 
and,

1875
01:26:45,611 --> 01:26:48,360
and truly thrive in it.
And that's the difference.

1876
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:50,880
But the elite performer and anomaly,

1877
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,060
yeah,
I mean even like simple things like tell

1878
01:26:54,061 --> 01:26:58,170
yourself you're going to do an hour and 
a half on an elliptical machine.

1879
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:02,250
What seems real easy for five minutes 
and then 10 minutes and you're like,

1880
01:27:02,251 --> 01:27:07,251
fuck,
I got an hour and 20 more minutes this 

1881
01:27:07,251 --> 01:27:09,730
bullshit.
And then you know as you're going and 

1882
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:10,260
not reduce the level,
keep the level at the same.

1883
01:27:10,261 --> 01:27:13,170
And just force yourself to do it.
That's not easy to do,

1884
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:15,810
but that ain't shit compared to an ultra
marathon.

1885
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,080
So there's levels to everything.
And then how about these crazy fucks 

1886
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:25,080
that do like there's people that do to 
ultra marathons in a row,

1887
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:30,200
like they'll do an ultra marathon and 
they'll do an ultra marathon back 

1888
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,470
because a regular ultra marathon is not 
fucking crazy enough for these people 

1889
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:35,700
because they did want to find the edge.
What?

1890
01:27:35,701 --> 01:27:37,470
When's the edge?
Or I hit it.

1891
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,270
Nope,
I think I can go further.

1892
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:44,450
I think I'm building up more endurance.
I think I'm building the goal more 

1893
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:44,450
mental toughness.
I can go further.

1894
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:47,520
Have you ever heard of Wynn Hoff?
I've heard that.

1895
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:48,900
What does the iceman?
Yes.

1896
01:27:48,901 --> 01:27:49,400
That crazy.

1897
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:51,860
That good.
Ran a marathon in the,

1898
01:27:51,861 --> 01:27:54,920
uh,
in the desert without drinking water.

1899
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:59,980
Yeah.
He goes and does his crease craziest 

1900
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:02,071
immersions and,
and like freezing temperatures and he 

1901
01:28:02,071 --> 01:28:02,570
can keep his core temperature without 
changing.

1902
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,280
He holds the world record like two 
hours.

1903
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:09,670
So he's saying that he's come up with a 
method that he can teach you how to 

1904
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:11,300
change your physiology to be able to 
adapt to these things.

1905
01:28:11,301 --> 01:28:13,750
And it's with breathing techniques,
um,

1906
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:17,200
commitment and a cold water immersion.
Wim Hoff.

1907
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:18,550
Fucking alien.
That guy,

1908
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,970
Hey,
I did is uh,

1909
01:28:19,971 --> 01:28:22,730
I bought his thing the other day and me 
and becky did the breathing thing.

1910
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,800
Um,
my wife and the first day I did it,

1911
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:26,930
I hold my breath for two minutes and 41 
seconds.

1912
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:29,720
My wife held it for two minutes and 30 
seconds after,

1913
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:31,940
after 15 minutes doing this breathing 
stuff.

1914
01:28:31,941 --> 01:28:33,740
And you held it for five minutes before 
we.

1915
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:38,360
Because that guy is somebody who is a 41
second.

1916
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:39,260
Yeah.
In short.

1917
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:41,260
In short shorts and no shirt.
Yeah.

1918
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,910
Summited everest.
Yeah.

1919
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:46,460
It took 26 people up to Kilimanjaro.
Uh,

1920
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:50,360
they submitted it and they all had a 
cancers or ailments or whatever,

1921
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:53,280
trained them for three months.
16 of them submitted.

1922
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:57,110
They did it in 20,
36 hours and they did it in shorts.

1923
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:02,470
You know what I mean?
His whole thing is I can train you to 

1924
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:02,470
take,
take over your and

1925
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:03,600
your autonomic nervous system.
Well,

1926
01:29:03,601 --> 01:29:05,250
a guy like that seeing,
you know,

1927
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:09,610
like people talk about mental training,
like cowboy cerrone on the other day and

1928
01:29:09,611 --> 01:29:11,290
uh,
I asked him if he's involved in,

1929
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:16,350
you know,
he's talking about like Mindfox and 

1930
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:16,350
things that go wrong and fights.
I'm like,

1931
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:16,470
have you ever done any mentor training 
at all?

1932
01:29:16,471 --> 01:29:18,660
And he's like never fucked with any of 
that stuff,

1933
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:23,690
but I think you get a guy who was as 
tough as like a cowboy cerrone and you 

1934
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:25,080
teach him some shit like this.
Absolutely.

1935
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:28,260
It's all next level.
This is the elite of the elite.

1936
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,690
You know what I mean?
So if you can get your physical,

1937
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,870
your physical performance up to the top 
level,

1938
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:38,930
then you're selling yourself short.
If you're not only also having a mental 

1939
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:40,370
aspect to your game,
you have to have a mental aspect to your

1940
01:29:40,371 --> 01:29:40,530
game.

1941
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:45,530
You have to be mentally draining.
I think also like people get used to 

1942
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:49,071
shit,
you get used to stuff and you get used 

1943
01:29:49,071 --> 01:29:49,071
to stuff like where it's not that bad 
anymore.

1944
01:29:49,071 --> 01:29:49,460
Like,
you know,

1945
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:51,720
I do this.
Have you done the Cryo therapy yet?

1946
01:29:51,721 --> 01:29:52,510
Have you done any of that?
No.

1947
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,570
What are you doing after this?
You want to go do it?

1948
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:57,600
Two hundred 70 degrees below zero for 
three minutes.

1949
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:59,250
Fucking awesome.
My mom did it.

1950
01:29:59,251 --> 01:30:00,620
She says amazing.
Amazing.

1951
01:30:00,621 --> 01:30:02,400
You get out of there,
you feel like a fucking Werewolf,

1952
01:30:02,401 --> 01:30:03,660
like you're going to run through 
buildings.

1953
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:04,370
Oh,
sign.

1954
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:10,260
So the point is though,
like I do it so often it's nothing but 

1955
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:12,660
the first time I did I was like,
Oh shit,

1956
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,430
now I do it.
I just stand there.

1957
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:18,050
Like I literally like the timer goes off
at three minutes online.

1958
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:19,260
I can keep going.

1959
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,920
I could just keep going.
My body body's so.

1960
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,850
It's so normal to me.
I get used to it.

1961
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:26,370
I wonder if that's what's going on with 
his wind Hoff guy too.

1962
01:30:26,371 --> 01:30:31,371
It's like his mind has a category for 
these states and he puts himself in 

1963
01:30:31,441 --> 01:30:36,441
these antique and slowly but surely 
increase the duration of these states 

1964
01:30:36,441 --> 01:30:40,970
and the suffering and the in his body 
understands how to mitigate whatever 

1965
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,860
issues might come up from.
It's got a documentary on Vice Joe,

1966
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:44,610
check it out.
It's like 39 slash 40 minutes.

1967
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:47,340
I keep hearing about it.
I and I haven't looked into it enough.

1968
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,050
I want to read the facts machine I 
bought.

1969
01:30:49,051 --> 01:30:52,080
I bought the programs like a 10 week 
program for 200 bucks.

1970
01:30:52,081 --> 01:30:52,710
I was like,
I'm getting it.

1971
01:30:52,711 --> 01:30:53,880
That's awesome.
I want to do that.

1972
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:55,470
Yeah,
I need to get that guy in here.

1973
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,470
Those people that are like that,
those outliers,

1974
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,820
those are real outliers.

1975
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:01,440
So it's people that like,
like I said,

1976
01:31:01,441 --> 01:31:04,530
when you talk about doing an ultra 
marathon or something along those lines,

1977
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:09,531
like for most people like God,
that's the develop mental toughness is 

1978
01:31:09,531 --> 01:31:13,701
involved in that is insane.
And then you hear about this guy and 

1979
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:13,701
roller bolt,
fuck.

1980
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:15,300
Well there's always going to be someone 
who's taking it to the next place.

1981
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:17,490
Next Guy's going to do it fucking 
barefoot,

1982
01:31:17,491 --> 01:31:18,810
you know?
I mean it's just,

1983
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,840
he's cool because he,
he hooks up with scientists and they 

1984
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,270
regulate everything.
They take the blood before and during,

1985
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:26,240
after he's looked up to the machine.
So he's like,

1986
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,940
he can prove now it's,
you know,

1987
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,290
it's proven evidence proven that what 
he's doing,

1988
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:31,840
you know,
that's,

1989
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,340
that's really cool about it.
That's from being different.

1990
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:38,100
Some like some religious cuc or whatever
to hey this is how I'm doing it,

1991
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:43,280
this is why this time effecting my 
autonomic nervous system and now I got 

1992
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:43,560
the science to back it up.
Right.

1993
01:31:43,561 --> 01:31:48,561
So a lot of people,
they look at that and they think of it 

1994
01:31:48,561 --> 01:31:48,630
as like walking on coals,
which is really just kind of a horseshit

1995
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:53,660
trick.
You just walk fast and it gets fucked 

1996
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:53,660
up,
but you're fine,

1997
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:54,240
you know.
Whereas this guy,

1998
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:59,450
I love that too,
that he has brought in scientists to 

1999
01:31:59,450 --> 01:31:59,530
make sure,
like there's zero fuckery involved here.

2000
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,920
This is a guy that really understands 
how to regulate his body temperature and

2001
01:32:03,921 --> 01:32:06,170
his breathing and no,
no

2002
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:08,580
false hope and.
But that's exactly what we're doing with

2003
01:32:08,581 --> 01:32:10,050
Dr Gordon and the foundation.
Hey,

2004
01:32:10,051 --> 01:32:11,850
there's no false hope here.
You know what I mean?

2005
01:32:11,851 --> 01:32:13,460
So what he's doing,
when I love about him,

2006
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:13,860
he was like,
hey,

2007
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:18,861
no false hope.
What we're putting out to the guys out 

2008
01:32:18,861 --> 01:32:18,861
here,
if you're listening,

2009
01:32:18,861 --> 01:32:22,070
there's no false hope and Dr Gordon's 
program and through the were angels 

2010
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:26,031
foundation,
it's all science evidence based and 

2011
01:32:26,031 --> 01:32:29,211
we've set up a system that's so advanced
that you don't even have to go to a 

2012
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:31,230
doctor's office,
be able to see Dr Gordon.

2013
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:34,170
Everything is paperless,
done through skype.

2014
01:32:34,171 --> 01:32:36,510
So we've got personalized 
individualized,

2015
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:41,920
uh,
methods for medicine to see one of the 

2016
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,390
world's most renowned people to treat 
traumatic brain injuries.

2017
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:45,420
We're now bringing that to every veteran
that signs up through our program.

2018
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:47,010
Did you brought the whole thing full 
circle?

2019
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:48,580
Okay.
Did that fucking.

2020
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,510
You've been doing media do it.
You know how to bring it back.

2021
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:57,990
Now I'm the Warrior Angels Foundation.
What does anybody have to do if they 

2022
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:59,370
want to get involved in this?
Like say someone's listening to this and

2023
01:32:59,371 --> 01:33:00,150
they say,
you know,

2024
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:01,920
they're thinking themselves.
This,

2025
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:03,240
this applies to me,
right?

2026
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:04,180
Like,
I know,

2027
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,240
I know this could help me.
I know I have this issue.

2028
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,770
All you gotta to do is go to our

2038
01:33:35,941 --> 01:33:36,570
no nothing,
man.

2039
01:33:36,571 --> 01:33:38,220
It's all digitalized,
uh,

2040
01:33:38,221 --> 01:33:40,590
all done through the cloud.
So we get all that information.

2041
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:43,770
Once we get all your information in,
Dr Gordon in his office,

2042
01:33:43,771 --> 01:33:45,360
check it.
They make sure you're a good candidate.

2043
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:50,660
Once that's been decided,
we'll go ahead and we'll start with 

2044
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:50,660
funding you.
And um,

2045
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,290
when we make the funds go through,
you'll get your blood test,

2046
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:55,080
we'll send a.
We have access labs and Florida.

2047
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:56,460
All right,
so they'll do your labs.

2048
01:33:56,461 --> 01:33:58,770
So they send the labs to you,
to you wherever you're at,

2049
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:04,040
and they will make plans for you to go 
to a lab that's the closest to your 

2050
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:04,040
geographical location.

2051
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:08,210
So that's the only time you're gonna 
have to leave your house to do this 

2052
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:08,210
thing.
So you'll go,

2053
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:08,790
you'll go to leave your house to go get 
your labs drawn.

2054
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:11,070
They'll ticket,
they'll take the labs,

2055
01:34:11,071 --> 01:34:12,900
they'll send that back to Florida,
Florida.

2056
01:34:12,901 --> 01:34:17,901
We'll get it there,
analyze the results they're seeing the 

2057
01:34:17,901 --> 01:34:17,901
results to Dr Gordon.
Dr Gordon gets it,

2058
01:34:17,901 --> 01:34:18,510
he gets the results,
makes a,

2059
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:19,560
a,
a,

2060
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,900
uh,
they schedule an appointment with you to

2061
01:34:21,901 --> 01:34:26,901
do a one on one consultation and he'll 
go over everything in complete detail 

2062
01:34:26,901 --> 01:34:30,610
and answer all your questions there and 
then go over what your protocols,

2063
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:35,430
what do thinks your protocol should be 
before we actually do a skype,

2064
01:34:35,431 --> 01:34:40,431
I write a four page report which gets 
sent by email to the patient and it has 

2065
01:34:40,431 --> 01:34:45,140
English in it,
not just medical leaves in an explains 

2066
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,980
some of the results and it gives them a 
chart of what the suggested first group 

2067
01:34:50,371 --> 01:34:53,220
of products or the first approach will 
be.

2068
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:58,670
And then through Fedex we send a very 
comprehensive patient that's a put 

2069
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:58,670
together

2070
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:00,380
specifically based upon their lab 
results.

2071
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:05,620
It's about 80 pages in total and 
explains why we did every single one of 

2072
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:09,941
the tests and how they interpret out and
then supportive documentation from the 

2073
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:12,530
general medical literature that's out 
there.

2074
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,110
Um,
and then through the skype,

2075
01:35:15,111 --> 01:35:20,111
which is 45 minutes to an hour,
we go through every single one of the 

2076
01:35:20,111 --> 01:35:23,351
lab tests and how it pertains to them 
after we discuss their traumas or 

2077
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:27,620
whatever their accident that they had or
if they're a civilian in the lack of any

2078
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:29,540
accident.
But here's what your results are.

2079
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:35,080
And then we make arrangements for either
their doctor to participate with us or 

2080
01:35:35,301 --> 01:35:36,990
one of our doctors,
you know,

2081
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:40,460
since November twelfth when I saw you 
last year,

2082
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:45,780
um,
my new book on traumatic brain injury 

2083
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:47,780
came out and I'm a new lecture series 
came out and we did that in San Diego.

2084
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:51,740
And part of the reason why there are now
more doctors aware of what we,

2085
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:57,040
what we do is because we trained 45 docs
from five different countries in the 

2086
01:35:57,651 --> 01:36:00,260
protocols that we've developed over the 
past 10 years.

2087
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:03,800
And the results we had.
Andrew was there and spoke to them.

2088
01:36:03,801 --> 01:36:08,801
We had a night of Friday night,
which was for military night since we 

2089
01:36:08,801 --> 01:36:12,641
were so close to coordinate island and 
invited the military.

2090
01:36:13,371 --> 01:36:18,371
Anyone active war.
Presently I'm a veteran to come to the 

2091
01:36:18,371 --> 01:36:21,350
meeting and to hear Andrew talk about 
his own life's experience.

2092
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:23,540
You know,
I can be the egg head and tell you about

2093
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:28,541
the science that's behind it,
but what's really impacting on both the 

2094
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:32,831
psychological,
emotional level is listening to someone 

2095
01:36:32,831 --> 01:36:35,480
as you did to Matthew Gazani when he was
on the show and Andrew telling his story

2096
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:40,481
of how he transitioned from this 
phenomenal life to this great military 

2097
01:36:40,481 --> 01:36:44,591
life,
that then the injuries and then what 

2098
01:36:44,591 --> 01:36:46,661
happened after it and then having all 
these standardized medical procedures 

2099
01:36:46,851 --> 01:36:51,851
done,
which really didn't help to bring them 

2100
01:36:51,851 --> 01:36:52,370
to the level that he's at right now,
which is according to his mother,

2101
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:53,000
father,
sister,

2102
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:58,001
brother.
Your dog also said that you were acting 

2103
01:36:58,001 --> 01:36:58,001
much better than you were in the past 
ever.

2104
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:00,580
Right,
and his life is transition.

2105
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:04,440
The emails he sends me about the quality
that he's experienced,

2106
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:07,670
that's what it's about.
Regardless of what we do,

2107
01:37:07,671 --> 01:37:12,671
it's always about,
unfortunately the end point of the 

2108
01:37:12,671 --> 01:37:15,820
journey that we're taking right now is 
that bringing you back to a 

2109
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:16,040
functionality where you're enjoying 
life.

2110
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:16,700
How's your life?

2111
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:17,990
Yeah.
Couldn't be any better,

2112
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:19,050
I couldn't be any better.
And,

2113
01:37:19,051 --> 01:37:20,690
and that's what we're,
that's what we're saying.

2114
01:37:20,691 --> 01:37:25,691
Hey,
we want to bring this to everybody out 

2115
01:37:25,691 --> 01:37:25,691
there who's been told,
like I was told,

2116
01:37:25,691 --> 01:37:29,410
this is the new you take a notebook 
around with you because you're gonna 

2117
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:29,600
have to write stuff down because you're 
not going to be able to remember it.

2118
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:34,750
And here's an important thing.
There's a donate link and the donate 

2119
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:37,190
link at a warrior,
Angels Foundation Dot Org.

2120
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:42,550
The donate link is really important 
because there's a lot of guys that just 

2121
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:45,941
didn't have the funds.
They don't have funds for this kind of 

2122
01:37:45,941 --> 01:37:48,251
treatment.
And it's not covered by insurance 

2123
01:37:48,251 --> 01:37:48,251
companies.
Correct.

2124
01:37:48,251 --> 01:37:48,310
I mean,
there's any insurance covering this all.

2125
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,620
What happened?
Um,

2126
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:53,550
let's see how Matthew Gosney got in as I
take a,

2127
01:37:53,730 --> 01:37:54,790
a,
a,

2128
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:58,440
of my practice and put it into a 
separate fund.

2129
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,340
And that's how I think,
uh,

2130
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:05,690
uh,
started funding the military is through 

2131
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:06,130
our practice because it's,
you know,

2132
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:09,060
for a year,
the first year it's $5,000

2133
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:11,280
all inclusive.
Everything.

2134
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:15,100
Because we've gotten donations from our 
laboratory,

2135
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:19,230
the laboratory that we use,
access medical lab has given us a lot of

2136
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:24,290
money to help offset the costs for the 
labs are compounding pharmacy 

2137
01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:26,520
university.
Compounding pharmacy gave us $100,000

2138
01:38:26,521 --> 01:38:31,521
grant so that testosterone is for free.
Any of the compounded products free.

2139
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:37,160
Another pharmacy pharmacy gives us all 
our clomid so that the first three 

2140
01:38:37,741 --> 01:38:41,910
months of product for the,
the less than 40 year old veterans,

2141
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:47,180
they get clomid,
which helps stimulate their own body to 

2142
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:47,820
make testosterone.
We just got a $10,000

2143
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:52,821
grant from a pure encapsulations for the
key antioxidants that we use for brain 

2144
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:58,281
health and a lot of help streamlining 
those costs coming in and get this joe 

2145
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:03,531
the 5,000
in year one is compared to what the va 

2146
01:39:03,531 --> 01:39:04,650
spins,
which is $15,000

2147
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:09,810
and the Congressional Budget Office 
report in 2012 for Tbi and PTSD,

2148
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:15,230
15 to $16,000
to treat that and all they use is 

2149
01:39:15,230 --> 01:39:15,600
medication and psychotherapy.

2150
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,600
So it gets more as the years goes on.
Whereas we're fixing an underlying 

2151
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:20,600
condition.
We're fixing the problem,

2152
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:22,770
$5,000
for the first year,

2153
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:25,290
about 3,500,
2,535

2154
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:30,291
the second year,
and then every year thereafter the cost 

2155
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:31,440
is about $1,500.
The same cop was,

2156
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:36,450
it had a $66 billion dollars is what 
they're paying for all the medical care 

2157
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:41,721
in 2012 slash $66,000,000,000.
That's why we're getting listened to 

2158
01:39:41,721 --> 01:39:44,040
because we're were like,
look at the difference and variations of

2159
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:47,930
these prices of what you guys are 
spending and result and the end,

2160
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:51,030
the end result don't.
But nobody cared about the end result.

2161
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,740
They cared about numbers from that 
crazy.

2162
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:57,800
Yeah.
And let me just tell anybody who's 

2163
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:57,800
listening.
If I made.

2164
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:01,590
My daughter has a jewelry company and 
she's volunteered to,

2165
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:06,000
um,
to gift to anyone who gives $5,000

2166
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:11,790
a coin,
which is a 1800 years of age silver coin

2167
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:13,560
from a roam.

2168
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,900
All authentic.
They look brand new coins,

2169
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:17,850
um,
as a gift.

2170
01:40:17,851 --> 01:40:21,210
Anyone who helps us with $5,000,
uh,

2171
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:24,930
Eric coins or era,
if I can say her website.

2172
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,470
Sure.
Okay.

2173
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:29,010
It's e R A,
B Y R,

2174
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:32,160
g.com,
and on there you'll see giving,

2175
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:37,430
it actually shows what she's a producing
in her jewelry company and donating to a

2176
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:44,240
warrior angels foundation so they can 
hand it out to people who are donating 

2177
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:45,600
money.
Now,

2178
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:47,970
is there any resistance to this,
this type of training?

2179
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:50,100
Is there a,
are there any detractors,

2180
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:53,670
a training insensitive over the seven 
training treatment rather?

2181
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:54,490
Uh,
no.

2182
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:55,900
Um,
in fact,

2183
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:59,200
um,
everything is FDA approved.

2184
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:02,830
Everything is being used at 
physiological levels.

2185
01:41:02,831 --> 01:41:07,690
I think I shared with you on past show 
that we use a blended testosterone,

2186
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:10,720
a injectable that we developed about 14 
years ago,

2187
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:16,080
which gets into the brain a lot faster 
than the cip yonatan the Atlantic that's

2188
01:41:16,751 --> 01:41:21,751
out there,
different types of testosterone and we 

2189
01:41:21,751 --> 01:41:21,760
use a very low dose,
40 milligrams,

2190
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:26,790
which is the amount that a healthy 25 to
35 year old makes in a week's time.

2191
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:32,310
So we're using everything physiologic 
and it's not just about hormone 

2192
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:34,170
replenishment,
it's about the micronutrients that we're

2193
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:37,960
using to help with the hormone so that 
they work.

2194
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:42,990
I mean,
you need to have a well balanced 

2195
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:43,180
machinery in the brain in order to get 
all the benefits and you,

2196
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:48,480
no one is addressing the inflammatory 
aspect to brain trauma and without 

2197
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,360
addressing that,
you can't get improvement.

2198
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:54,370
Now I know there's sustained improvement
that they're developing new testosterone

2199
01:41:54,371 --> 01:41:57,730
that's animal based.
Instead of using yams,

2200
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:02,780
the,
they're using animals somehow or 

2201
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:03,430
another,
and they're avoiding detection with,

2202
01:42:03,431 --> 01:42:03,920
uh,
uh,

2203
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:04,430
these,
uh,

2204
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:06,830
drug testing when they're doing these,
um,

2205
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,370
carbon isotope tests,
right?

2206
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:12,460
This is new.
This is the new thing that,

2207
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:13,120
that,
uh,

2208
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,640
the,
the people on the fringe of the cheating

2209
01:42:15,641 --> 01:42:16,550
movement.
Yeah.

2210
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:21,870
Well,
if you can get the testosterone more so 

2211
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:21,940
into the brain because we're just 
testosterone from really work.

2212
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:23,890
Yeah,
it does work to help build muscle,

2213
01:42:23,891 --> 01:42:26,470
but what controls the muscle?
The brain.

2214
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:32,020
We were just talking about how people 
succeed in freezing and Eisman and 

2215
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,670
Kilimanjaro.
It's all the brain.

2216
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,810
So if you can increase the brain's 
ability to be resistant to failure,

2217
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:42,430
meaning that you've got a mindset,
you're going to do it regardless of hell

2218
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:43,510
or high water,
you're going to do it.

2219
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:48,960
That's really where the benefits are,
so the testosterone increases those 

2220
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:48,960
benefits.
Correct,

2221
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,450
and low dose,
a very well absorbed,

2222
01:42:52,451 --> 01:42:55,450
both like two stops from appropriate,
gets into the system,

2223
01:42:55,451 --> 01:43:00,451
into the cells and three to four hours 
and it's out of the blood so you don't 

2224
01:43:00,451 --> 01:43:02,980
detect it appropriate.
What about that?

2225
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,170
You were.
You developed drops.

2226
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:07,200
Little light bulbs.
SOMOS Nana live too.

2227
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:12,250
So mit's a compounded product.
We developed the vehicle that the 

2228
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:16,981
compounding pharmacies can legal legally
put testosterone into this liquid and 

2229
01:43:17,891 --> 01:43:18,790
the liquid is put under.

2230
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:23,790
The tongue was put into the mouth and 
washed around and gets absorbed because 

2231
01:43:23,790 --> 01:43:26,950
the particle size is so small,
it gets absorbed rapidly,

2232
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:32,070
but there's a different world.
This is something you have to do every 

2233
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,070
day,
right?

2234
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,070
This is one that,
yeah,

2235
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:34,060
our testing showed that either once a 
day,

2236
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:36,820
ideally once a day is the best,
but uh,

2237
01:43:36,821 --> 01:43:41,320
you get to regulate the responsiveness 
that you have the response.

2238
01:43:41,321 --> 01:43:45,700
So if you want to have a nice easy day,
take one squirt on the tongue.

2239
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:47,350
If you want to have really energetic 
day,

2240
01:43:47,351 --> 01:43:50,370
you'd take two.
If you want to have a fun night for many

2241
01:43:50,370 --> 01:43:51,010
hours,
you take four.

2242
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:52,070
That

2243
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,200
sounds like you're encouraging people to
get fucking crazy.

2244
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,520
I educate everybody.
It's prescription only.

2245
01:43:58,521 --> 01:44:00,590
And with all the great doctors out 
there,

2246
01:44:00,591 --> 01:44:03,320
they'll regulate it and it,
and it's not,

2247
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:08,350
it's not a magic pill,
but what it'll do is it'll allow you to 

2248
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:11,870
live life the way it was intended to be.
You know what I mean?

2249
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,600
So before,
if you couldn't react to something,

2250
01:44:14,601 --> 01:44:16,670
now you'll be able to react to things 
appropriately.

2251
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:18,810
You'll be able to do things 
appropriately towards.

2252
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:20,060
If you're,
if you're have a,

2253
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:23,750
your neurochemistry is not in balance,
then you can't.

2254
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:25,790
So this will give you the opportunity to
do that.

2255
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:31,780
So in closing,
is there anything else you guys want to 

2256
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:35,011
say?
Warrior Angels Foundation Dot Org is 

2257
01:44:35,011 --> 01:44:35,011
where you can go to learn more about 
this.

2258
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:35,460
We got it

2259
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:38,380
crowdfunding campaign that you can get 
to through our website.

2260
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:40,630
Um,
we got awesome perks on there,

2261
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:43,360
like a range day with me shooting at the
range.

2262
01:44:43,361 --> 01:44:47,020
You got videos on there for that.
I'm cool mugs or whatever.

2263
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:49,350
So some incentives to give.
And uh,

2264
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:54,540
and anything you want to find out about 
Dr Gordon or also his daughter will be 

2265
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:54,540
on our website as well.

2266
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:59,030
I will say that a life extension 
magazine that in 2012 did the article on

2267
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:04,010
hormones to heal the brain in the 
military is doing a followup,

2268
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:09,310
a followup article where they've gone to
six or eight of our patients for I think

2269
01:45:10,311 --> 01:45:15,311
military and two are for non nonmilitary
and interviewed them to get their 

2270
01:45:15,311 --> 01:45:17,860
experience over the past few years that,
uh,

2271
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:21,980
since the 2012 article.
And I think it'll be important for those

2272
01:45:21,981 --> 01:45:26,981
people who are thinking about maybe 
getting involved in what we're doing to 

2273
01:45:26,981 --> 01:45:29,150
read that.
I think it's coming out a the end of the

2274
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:31,400
year to read it and listen to the 
experience.

2275
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:32,900
Where else go back to the,
uh,

2276
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:36,530
Matthew Gazani Jason Hall,
November Twelfth of last year.

2277
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:41,830
And listen to the podcast that was done 
because I get a lot of calls of how many

2278
01:45:42,441 --> 01:45:44,690
people exactly what he said was what I'm
going through.

2279
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:50,680
And I think listening to those that are 
injured and get onto the program more 

2280
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:51,500
important than anything I can say.

2281
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:54,600
And also Joe,
because we're on here today,

2282
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,130
lives will be changed,
man.

2283
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,200
I,
it's probably hard to comprehend that,

2284
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:03,440
but thank you for this opportunity 
because it's going to have a ripple 

2285
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,320
effect that you probably aren't gonna be
able to understand,

2286
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:09,590
but my being on here,
things were things that were going to 

2287
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:09,840
affect people's lives in a positive,
positive way.

2288
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:11,240
That's you.
That's what I hope.

2289
01:46:11,241 --> 01:46:13,700
And thank you.
Thank you for starting this foundation.

2290
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:16,160
Thank you for being so active with it.
Dark Dot Gordon.

2291
01:46:16,161 --> 01:46:21,161
I mean this is all amazing stuff and 
whenever you hear about people getting 

2292
01:46:21,161 --> 01:46:24,911
help like this and how effective it is,
it's just a beautiful thing is really 

2293
01:46:24,911 --> 01:46:26,660
awesome.
