this is a fight companion podcast.

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,160
What that means is if you've tuned in
hoping to hear enlightening conversation

9
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:21,520
or facts about the universe or
ancient civilizations and run,

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,530
he comes to the wrong place pitches.

00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,740
This is a bunch of people that shouldn't

Kill a bee.

14
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:36,990
Ben Saunders is up in this bid.

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,230

and uh,

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,110
we're here watching the
UFC live from North Korea.

20
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,230
Yeah,

21
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,120
rest four minutes and 40 seconds.

22
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:53,650
Who would you give the
round two that's different.

23
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,120
It's not the same is the same.

24
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,720
You described a totally different
situation around and he got knocked down.

25
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,030
Round means more at the end of
the guy would personally count.

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,401
I said,

27
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:06,580
Doug,

28
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,030
how you're doing towards the end
of the talk over each other please.

29
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,040
That's not the way the rocks,

30
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,900
the biggest star was coming back.

31
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:14,950
Is He?

32
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,150
What's going is all talk,

33
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,103
but I don't know.

34
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,381
You know,

35
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:18,460
there's all sorts of talk,

36
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:18,701
but I,

37
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:18,911
you know,

38
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:20,060
I had heard a lot of talkers,

39
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,373
Bronto,

40
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,870
then we can't talk over each other,

41
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:26,140
so people will listen and there's
no way this is going to work.

42
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,851
Someone's,

43
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,240
he's just a head of tech people get,

44
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,260
they're just better.

45
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,150
They're just like Marcello's.

46
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,970
When I was watching
lines up with the weight,

47
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,053
has anyone else

48
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,680
tried,

49
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,930
try this guys,

50
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:41,910
we can't talk over each.

51
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,220
Sorry.

52
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,410
How much would you like to
see him versus Damien Maia?

53
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,040
He's going to out strike everybody.

54
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,670
I'd like to see him fight.

55
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
Can't take him down.

56
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,210
I haven't seen it.

57
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,000
The wonderful wonder.

58
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,410
Oh yeah,

59
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:54,761
I got a lot.

60
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:55,360
Of course.

61
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,410
Edgy Bra,

62
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,640
also known as Eddie Bravo.

63
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,403
It's your Bra.

64
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,030
That's what they taught
when we were in Brazil.

65
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:01,361
That's there.

66
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:01,740
They call me.

67
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,480
The issue is Joe Moran were those,

68
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,480
the first giant tournament that
there was an la Joe morale.

69
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,250
He was the main promoter
and in my division it was
45 guys were all blue belts

70
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:13,751
and my division.

71
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:14,190
He's,

72
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,880
and you got to sit
there and listen to him.

73
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,410
Call out everyone's name
and I'm sitting there,

74
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:20,410
I'm waiting for him to call my name is he?

75
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:20,621
Look,

76
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:21,550
he looks at the clipboard.

77
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:22,240
Then he looks up to the,

78
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,073
here's your Bra.

79
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,440
I'm standing right in front of him.

80
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:26,651
I'm like,

81
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:26,921
man,

82
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:28,000
when are they going to call my dad?

83
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,283
Like fuck.

84
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,111
And then someone say,

85
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:32,321
dude,

86
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:33,490
I think he's saying your name.

87
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:34,324
No Way.

88
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,990
Yeah.

89
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,711
Where's Rick Story?

90
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:36,544
Ben?

91
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,020
It's a long story.

92
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,310
[inaudible] it was the weed.

93
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,640
That ball landed in the bed or mine

94
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,110
and he probably just went to Pete's.

95
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:02,710
Fantastic.

96
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,220
He gets so worked up.

97
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,470
I was hoping you jump over
here and choke the shit.

98
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,400
He loves conspiracy theories
about nine 11 inside.

99
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,243
Y'All

100
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,230
don't,

101
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,763
I don't know man.

102
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,941
Don't answer that.

103
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,760
I just saw you're already smart.

104
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Get get any another beer down real quick.

105
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,670
He's going to fuck this up

106
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,391
real quick.

107
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:25,901
Chem trails?

108
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:26,770
Yes or no vaccine.

109
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
A killer or an aid.

110
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,581
How many,

111
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,260
how many towers went down on nine 11.

112
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:33,094
Oh my God.

113
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,220
I know.

114
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,470
He knows my brother's crazy.

115
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,304
Like you are so and

116
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,040
oh shit.

117
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,750
Donald Serone very happy.

118
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,230
The fact that he knows the three
towers went down means that,

119
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:46,450
uh,

120
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,283
you kind of,

121
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,040
she knows.

122
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,611
No.

123
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,010
Most people don't know that.

124
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,560
Most people don't know when that
a press conference with Nist,

125
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,630
the National Institute of
Standards and technologies,

126
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,620
they're the ones that came out
and explained what happened.

127
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,270
Tower something.

128
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,730
When they asked him why didn't,

129
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,340
did you guys check for closeups?

130
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,810
It's really simple.

131
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,890
It's like kindergarten shit.

132
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,450
When they asked the head of kindergarten,

133
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:09,790
why didn't you check for explosives?

134
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,160
Why didn't you test for
explosives on tower seven?

135
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,080
They said there was no reason to.

136
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,940
That was no taste,

137
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,660
no witnesses.

138
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,470
Meanwhile,

139
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,600
there's about an hour of witnesses,

140
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,201
firemen,

141
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,940
policemen saying bombs went off.

142
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,820
There's video of what's going on.

143
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,853
And the guy said,

144
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,900
we didn't check for bombs
because there was no witness.

145
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,810
What about that honey
who flew those planes?

146
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,411
Nothing.

147
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,370
Anybody can say.

148
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,490
I can say to you,

149
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,700
there's nothing I can say.

150
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,560
I provided complete
video evidence for you.

151
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,060
I broke it down for you.

152
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,260
You're still,

153
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,680
it's still not enough
how much you say nothing.

154
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,514
I can say

155
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
I haven't said anything.

156
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,420
Let me play Devil's because some guy
asked me the other day if I wanted to have

157
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:09,541
someone who is a lot a flat
earth proponent is apparently
the best argue or for

158
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,150
a flat here that I want
to hear that argument.

159
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,530
What can they possibly say?

160
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,850
No fucking way either
trolling or retarded is weird.

161
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,720
Of course it's Trump,

162
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,500
but the one thing that's fucking
weird is you would think with all the

163
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:28,300
satellites we have going in and out of
our solar system and how come there's no

164
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:31,730
pictures of the earth and like the shirt,

165
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,920
I don't know.

166
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,260
It's a fact.

167
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,093
I'm Brian.

168
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,560
Yeah,

169
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,890
Cord Meyer was one of the
top CIA guys back then.

170
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,091
JFK.

171
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:49,630
This was Kay was banging
cored wires and wife.

172
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,040
So when you listen to this,

173
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,960
he Howard hunt concessional,

174
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,350
he said Lyndon B Johnson
straight at the whole thing.

175
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,170
He in.

176
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,890
He's telling you how I see AI
engine famous on his step by saying,

177
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,730
you look at,

178
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,990
we was cord Meyer cord.

179
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,030
Meyer wanted him denser Lyndon B Johnson.

180
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,290
He had court [inaudible].

181
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,290
Look how much the time that he bravo
spent smoking weed peering out curtain

182
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,300
senior first play that.

183
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,510
Are you shocked or something?

184
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,250
People are dying all the time.

185
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,930
Did you know during the day,

186
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,460
like this is some wide open.

187
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:19,851
She did.

188
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:24,851
You know how many astronauts died in 1968
to eight and then two more on 69 what

189
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:27,831
happened?

190
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:28,390
What are they doing?

191
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,650
Oh,

192
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,290
I'm flying into space accidents.

193
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,581
His father,

194
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:34,220
Prescott Bush started the CIA,

195
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:34,971
his father,

196
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:38,750
Prescott Bush finance the
Nazis through union bank.

197
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,000
That's not a conspiracy
theory that hold on.

198
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,800
You know in Sweden for many years,

199
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:49,040
they sterilize kids that
didn't have symmetric,

200
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,390
perfectly symmetrical faces.

201
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:50,990
That a fact.

202
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,630
It's actually nice.

203
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,990
That's some shit.

204
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,340
That's why they're so good looking.

205
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,133
I don't know.

206
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,311
I'll look into it.

207
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,630
You think you think that's crazy?

208
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,743
Pretty crazy.

209
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,720
When you say look into it,

210
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:03,590
did you look into it?

211
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,810
I got to meet her now.

212
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,670
Everything that's coming through the
major news that works all have an agenda

213
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:11,330
behind it,

214
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,590
whether it's district,

215
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,120
because if I was running shit,

216
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,050
I would,

217
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,190
if I was wanting to shit and they said,

218
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:16,550
hey,

219
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,450
what do you think we should do?

220
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:18,020
I'm like,

221
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,441
wait a minute.

222
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:19,820
Are you guys controlling the media?

223
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:20,590
First of all,

224
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,250
if they say no,

225
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:23,600
we're not really controlling the media.

226
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:24,500
They do whatever they want.

227
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,230
I would say control the Goddamn meeting.

228
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,190
What the fuck are you guys?

229
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,610
How would I get my information
at the library guys?

230
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,510
I go to the library,

231
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,200
apple bottom.

232
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,780
I'm so bullish on the fucking Internet.

233
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,511
Who goes out?

234
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,140
Library,

235
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,950
the library.

236
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,010
You guys get your information
from the Internet.

237
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,963
I go to the library.

238
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,841
Our library.

239
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:45,080
How you see the Internet as if
it's all the same source he did.

240
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:49,790
He was in this amazing documentary and
just a fucking life changing documentary

241
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,780
called the principal.

242
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,320
Have you seen that?

243
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,571
No,

244
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,400
I have not.

245
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,121
Fuck,

246
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,200
and Michio Kaku was in it.

247
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,280
A bunch of physicists,

248
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,050
like professors from Mit.

249
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,130
That's so funny.

250
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,470
I just saw the documentary sugarcoated.

251
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,221
Oh my God.

252
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:01,700
Have you seen it?

253
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,480
It's terrifying.

254
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,320
Holy Shit.

255
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,670
Real quick documentary.

256
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,330
This is,

257
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,890
this is one that I've
watched over and over.

258
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:07,730
It's really,

259
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:08,260
really good.

260
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
If you say it's the best of all.

261
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,311
No,

262
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:10,730
it's not.

263
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,151
It's not.

264
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:11,781
But it's really,

265
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:12,614
really good because,

266
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,480
especially for conspiracy theorist type,

267
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,150
it's called how big oil
conquered the world.

268
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,000
There's a documentary called the
fence will blow your fucking mind.

269
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,960
They never finished that.

270
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:21,794
They abandoned it.

271
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,820
It's deserted.

272
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,960
Mexican dudes are going,

273
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,160
what are these Americans doing?

274
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,560
They're interviewing Mexicans.

275
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:27,170
I'm just like,

276
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,003
this is easy.

277
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,100
This documentary's called about the birth
of oil and how it came in and infected

278
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:37,970
all our lives and how John Rockefeller
monopolized fucking everything to find

279
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:38,510
that dude.

280
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:38,910
It's,

281
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,711
it's an incredible,

282
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:40,820
and it's free on youtube.

283
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,151
Yeah.

284
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:42,470
That's a big red flag there.

285
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:42,591
Hey,

286
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:44,820
there's a documentary
you can watch on Youtube.

287
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:44,970
Oh,

288
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,803
here.

289
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,070
Oh,

290
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,321
Jay.

291
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,780
The untold story.

292
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,943
His son

293
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,370
or Netflix.

294
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:53,841
Oh No,

295
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:54,740
it's at the library,

296
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:55,574
Bro.

297
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,560
The Sugar Association.

298
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,700
They didn't want it to be labeled
as for what it really was,

299
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,270
uh,

300
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:04,511
uh,

301
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,890
an addictive toxin.

302
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,210
They want her to keep it at.

303
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:08,740
Ain't that bad in moderation.

304
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:09,640
It ain't that bad.

305
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,110
It makes things taste sweet.

306
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:11,944
It's about love.

307
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,570
They tell you,

308
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,170
they tell you we don't know shit.

309
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,110
We're looking at a bunch
of lights and the God,

310
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,880
Scott,

311
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,780
you're going to tell me that that light
and that light that's 250 a hundred

312
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,370
trillion light years away.

313
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,530
How the fuck did you figure that out?

314
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,240
Learned.

315
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,370
Well,

316
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,930
don't they have an
explanation for that shit?

317
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,291
No,

318
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:32,951
exactly.

319
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,820
That's what every what
you just said right now.

320
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:35,561
But what you just said,

321
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:36,250
now's what?

322
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,780
Everyone's natural reaction.

323
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,690
Cause anytime someone
says anything about space,

324
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,100
you automatically think
someone figured it out.

325
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,510
You don't know the guy's name.

326
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,190
You don't know the name of the experiment.

327
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,840
You didn't look into it yourself.

328
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:53,740
You just think when someone tells you
how far is the earth from the sun?

329
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,280
Oh say oh 93 million miles away.

330
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,620
Like you just write.

331
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,440
You will.

332
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Everybody relies on someone figured
that out and someone double checked it.

333
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,311
Dude,

334
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:07,150
it's math,

335
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,110
it's science,

336
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,770
it's math.

337
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,000
But no one really knows.

338
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,013
So they,

339
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,480
they paid according to this documentary,

340
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,520
they paid off Harvey.

341
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:14,681
You know,

342
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,260
cause everyone's like,

343
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,093
I'm flying,

344
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,750
I'm science.

345
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:16,961
This,

346
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:17,450
I'm science.

347
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,650
That it's beautiful when people do that
because then all you do is buy off all

348
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:22,240
the scientists and you got everybody.

349
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:23,260
I love some sugar though,

350
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:23,500
man.

351
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,660
Yeah,

352
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,640
we can all be bullshit.

353
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,490
Those documentaries gate so juiced up.

354
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,150
They're so,

355
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,050
they're so juicy.

356
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,040
They seem so good.

357
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,270
They seem so real.

358
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:33,820
You get fired up and then
once you get fired up,

359
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,320
it's tough to get unfired up.

360
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,350
I want to be in the Goddamn it a
little naughty if their Goddamn,

361
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:38,970
listen,

362
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,803
of course you do.

363
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,263
Just

364
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,473
the military,

365
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,930
the military credit for all the great
music that came out of the 60s you fucking

366
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,100
military scenario.

367
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,170
You are fucking shell

368
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,480
to start my own false flags.

369
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,220
Jones is going to call you a shell Monday
morning we got a disturbing turn of

370
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:02,760
events at Eddie Bravo
I've had on this podcast.

371
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,520
I did not know he was
in the Illuminati Shit.

372
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,540
Fuck yeah,

373
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,850
he is on the Joe Rogan experience.

374
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,803
Yes.

375
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:10,561
Yeah.

376
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,910
Trails proven to be false.

377
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:12,500
Fuck yeah.

378
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,333
Fuck yeah.

379
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,310
Fuck yeah.

380
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,270
I want a fucking,

381
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,193
oh my God,

382
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,900
you're in.

383
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,551
If Oh,

384
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,300
please let me,

385
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,200
let me get this straight.

386
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,034
My own fault.

387
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,403
I would,

388
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,810
if I would get that
fucking oil from Alaska,

389
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,670
I would go in there and make it,

390
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,541
make it an elect.

391
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,540
Trump make it look like the eye.

392
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,020
Isis is uh,

393
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,070
uh,

394
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,780
Eskimos are trained in Isis.

395
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,760
I would,

396
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,100
you know,

397
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,880
you're a national
treasure and I love blue.

398
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,180
Blue whale was a national trend.

399
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:39,960
None of these things are true.

400
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,980
It has to be frustrating.

401
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:41,880
Eddie to believe something.

402
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:42,261
He goes,

403
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:47,000
you constantly have to back years
ago and it is very exhausting.

404
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,050
When I post a meme,

405
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,720
I can see like people,

406
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,520
I could see my a followers rise,

407
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,680
but what I post anything like,

408
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:57,090
uh,

409
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,890
anti vaccine and he kinda dude hundreds.

410
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,800
It's like 72000.8 and then he goes,

411
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:12,070
it's 7.6 reach to do
what people don't like.

412
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:14,990
Conspiracy.

413
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,880
[inaudible]

414
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,600
I lost.

415
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:22,991
You know what?

416
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:23,651
I cleaned them out.

417
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:24,161
It's a filter.

418
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,480
I needed to clean those fuckers out.

419
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,760
Someone did come up to me and say,

420
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,743
hey,

421
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,530
you heard that conspiracy
theory where there's no forests?

422
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,060
Have you heard about this?

423
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,150
There's a conspiracy theory
where there's no chorus.

424
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,763
Look into it.

425
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:39,640
No,

426
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,421
no forest.

427
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,770
I bet you love these things.

428
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:42,041
I'm like,

429
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:42,880
I don't know what that is.

430
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:43,151
Really.

431
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:43,700
I didn't even look,

432
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,620
I watched 30 seconds cause someone
in class told me a Ziggy came up.

433
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,310
You have your debt
conspiracy theory about no,

434
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,183
I go,

435
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,190
what did,

436
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,140
I went home and I put no
forest and I was 13 seconds.

437
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,350
I just stopped it.

438
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,540
Have you seen the one with this to
do to the dinosaurs aren't real.

439
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,513
Have you seen that one?

440
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,480
That I don't have that I don't know.

441
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,483
I don't know.

442
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,410
That's like some other
shit where I'm like,

443
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,450
I don't believe any science.

444
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,313
I don't believe in that.

445
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,000
The only science I believe that you rub
two sticks together and there's fire

446
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:16,990
that's other than that,

447
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,370
you've got to prove that.

448
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,710
I'm going to ignore that shit.

449
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,670
All you gotta just tobacco science.

450
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,131
What about that,

451
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:26,170
that you think that Shit's gone?

452
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,590
I don't know a Frankie signs
because you don't know fighting bro.

453
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,600
How'd he say his name and
what's his background?

454
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:38,051
Turn this up.

455
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:38,381
Do you know?

456
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,300
We have a timeshare in town.

457
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,040
I would,

458
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,290
you'd be saying translate.

459
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,700
I just want to thank Brian going for Zach.

460
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,230
Here's my big inspiration is my pleasure
for me to watch him so much so I wish

461
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:58,900
he was here and to kiss him just one time.

462
00:13:58,901 --> 00:13:59,471
His Lips.

463
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:03,970
I know he's married and he's skinny,

464
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:04,970
but he's a beautiful eyes.

465
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,103
Would,

466
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,850
how would Joey translate what she saying?

467
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,451
Listen,

468
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:10,690
Ron,

469
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm coming for you.

470
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,320

put your fucking beans and rice and
following a child's and half mass.

472
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,390
Is it possible for Joey d to do
to impression of Conor McGregor?

473
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,410
Is that even possible?

474
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:39,780
Possible.

475
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,900
We would have to watch them,

476
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:45,500
but if you do an impression of Joey doing
an impression of what kind of allowed

477
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,870

478
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,720

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,570

Eddie Bravo.

485
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,740
I love how he calls your,

486
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,491

487
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:11,324
Brendan Sharp.

488
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,010
Openly gay.

489
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:14,900
Play by play commentator.

This guy's

494
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,563
delving

495
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,593
oil.

496
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,090
I have questions.

497
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,840
I'll be answering you.

498
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,780
It's just sweat.

499
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:41,150
It's not,

500
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,360
it's not an oil sweat for a
debt for their body on body.

501
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,203
Like

502
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,620
they're just working out
really hard in your body.

503
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,500
Your body heats up and um,

504
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,110
hit hit all the here.

505
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:53,720
Yeah.

506
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:53,960
Why?

507
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,720
Why are there so strong?

508
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,080
Because they're fighting.

509
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,270
They're fighting other men.

510
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:00,230
They have to be strong.

511
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,430
Otherwise you get your ass kicked and
you know you want to protect your joints

512
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,783
stuff.

513
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,501
Well,

514
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,230
you know the closer,

515
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,971
I'm pretty tight.

516
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,680
They've got quality Reebok gear on here,

517
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,960
cops and stuff.

518
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,890
Everything's fine.

519
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,120
You don't have to worry about that.

520
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,983
Okay.

521
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,280
You are you smelling good?

522
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,300
You are in general.

523
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,520
The shower day and I
just got back from Paris,

524
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,040
smell like a bear and I smell
like as far as just my leg,

525
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,730
the forest.

526
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,170
Brian,

527
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,220
do me a favor.

528
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,980
Tell them the dream you
had that you told me.

529
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,680
I tell them the dream thing.

530
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,250
Tell me if this is normal.

531
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,150
I think it's appropriate.

532
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,223
Okay.

533
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,810
This is my business partner.

534
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,080
Listen to this dream.

535
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:39,980
I had a boyfriend.

536
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:40,851
Okay,

537
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,140
that's not Martin Luther King.

538
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,120
And what were you doing right

539
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:50,970
now?

540
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,621
Listen to this shit.

541
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:53,790
Any fuck me get a dream.

542
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,010
He's having sex with a man.

543
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,191
Well,

544
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:59,780
I'm glad you told me this after I told
Steve Rinella that I don't want to share

545
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,240
a tent with you because he asked me.

546
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:02,571
He goes,

547
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,080
is it okay if you're sure Taylor,

548
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,460
Brian,

549
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:04,971
fuck yeah,

550
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:05,710
I do.

551
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,890
I still like a werewolf.

552
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,830
You look like a snoot I'm assuming.

553
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,730
No,

554
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,840
I have an irregular NASA.

555
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:12,674
Craziest,

556
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,131
craziest,

557
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:13,964
loudest snorer

558
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,450
mouthpiece of a new malware.

559
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,000
When we went hunting

560
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,120
third or fourth version,

561
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,640
cause I was linked up fitting,

562
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:26,151
right man.

563
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:27,230
I kept falling last one.

564
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:27,560
Yeah,

565
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,221
I kept falling out.

566
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:29,390
But the new one is,

567
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,420
it's uncomfortable but it fits great
and it keeps my tongue in place.

568
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:35,210
Makes no sound to sleep like a baby.

569
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:36,044
I make no sound.

570
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,950
Finish your gay story though.

571
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,903
I'm sorry.

572
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,480
And I was like,

573
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:41,990
and I was like,

574
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm straight man and I have a
boyfriend and this guy keeps fucking me

575
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,431
dream.

576
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:53,640
I was like straight as shit and this
guy's fucking me and I got to keep this a

577
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,474
secret.

578
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,790
I'm not sure how to
make sense of it is that

579
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,140
he was dead serious when he told me this
and I literally just looking at what it

580
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:04,490
is,

581
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,323
Bro.

582
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,340
She next hour,

583
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:07,174

584
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,370
Yay,

585
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,590
right it town right down.

586
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,210
The possibilities are endless with this
drain can go wherever dream like that

587
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,171
ever in my life,

588
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:19,470
dude.

589
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,041
I was like,

590
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:20,600
and I was like,

591
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,101
and the guy,

592
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:21,900
but I back,

593
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,940
he had a back on him and I was like,

594
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:24,660
damn man.

595
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,493
And I remember

596
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,560
I didn't tell you this part in cocktails,

597
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,960
we're having cocktails
and I was looking at her.

598
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:32,520
I go,

599
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,810
I fucked this guy again.

600
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,030
I was like,

601
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,923
yeah,

602
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,030
Fuck Shit.

603
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,460
It was crazy

604
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,460
straight man.

605
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,294
I'm fucking straight

606
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,160
disturbing how many jokes you
have like arguing your sexual,

607
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,700
I know it's like a big part of
your act as arguing your sexuality.

608
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,563
I was like,

609
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,310
he's 50% gain.

610
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,360
I don't have the issue with it.

611
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,410
I've hypothetical conversations
with important people in
my life and then when I

612
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,420
seen it goes nothing.

613
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:14,640
You have a hypothetical adversarial
conversations about important.

614
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,760
When you're ready for the conversation,

615
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,260
you're ready and you're like,

616
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:19,561
fuck,

617
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:20,394
he crushes you.

618
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,011
No,

619
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:21,421
no.

620
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,330
It means this becomes all friendly.

621
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,920
How's it going?

622
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,400
That's it.

623
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,230
I do the exact same thing.

624
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,310
And what I also do the
fuck you talking about,

625
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,051
he's crazy.

626
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:35,360
He's what he's telling you what I use.

627
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,090
If somebody did something that I was like,

628
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,370
Whoa,

629
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,121
that's Kinda mean,

630
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:39,660
or whatever,

631
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,310
then I'll extrapolate and I'll be like,

632
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:41,521
what did,

633
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:42,810
he was that way all the time.

634
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,800
And then what if he shoved me and then
I want to be called me a bitch and then

635
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:47,850
I'll just keep calling before know what?

636
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,470
I'm having the same exact thing.

637
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,510
I'm having a verbal argument in my car.

638
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,060
I have done that.

639
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,840
I have done,

640
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:54,991
yeah,

641
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:55,640
you're right.

642
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:55,821
No,

643
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,440
I get you now understand
he explained it better.

644
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,940
You're thinking,

645
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,361
okay,

646
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,820
this is motherfuckers going to come at
me with this and he's going to come at me

647
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:03,420
with that.

648
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:03,631
Well,

649
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,420
I got this right to him
and I got that right.

650
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:05,940
Correct.

651
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,280
And you're like practicing
through the whole thing.

652
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:09,510
Yeah,

653
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,090
I do that.

654
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,100
I think everybody does that.

655
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,830
I do something even I think I do
something even more ridiculous.

656
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,280
I daily have a fantasy that I live in
a part of the world where gangs are

657
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:24,561
running everything and you are
terrorizing my village or Los Angeles run.

658
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,690
And what I do then is I secretly,

659
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,030
I push a cart of food cart.

660
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm humble,

661
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,430
but I have a small gun with a silencer
and I kill all the bad guys quietly.

662
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:35,731
And they're like,

663
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:36,181
well fuck,

664
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,080
it's killing us man.

665
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:38,040
What the fuck is going on?

666
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,760
And I'm like,

667
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,593
would you like another,

668
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,890
a lot of the professional.

669
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,491
Yeah.

670
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:45,120
That's literally how I think
about how I protect myself.

671
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:45,841
Totally Sane.

672
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:46,674
All of you.

673
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,870
I feel Eddie Bravo.

674
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,900
That weird.

675
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,553
I'm sorry.

676
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,200
I thought something similar.

677
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,690
I thought,

678
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,150
no,

679
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,983
this isn't what I'm talking.

680
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,250
What if,

681
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,790
what if you could figure out how long
it takes to kill someone with the choke

682
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,780
and then how long it takes to put them
in a vegetative state permanently.

683
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,453
You mastered that.

684
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,300
Interesting.

685
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,410
So like anybody,

686
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:12,040
like you're like a vigilante and
anybody who deserves to be a vegetable,

687
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:12,790
you're not going to kill him.

688
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,870
Child molesters.

689
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,230
And you hope you have a timer,

690
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:16,390
you got 45 seconds,

691
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,890
you let them go in their vegetable.

692
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,761
If you didn't kill him,

693
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,050
that's genius to kill him.

694
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:20,884
But they're like,

695
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:21,551
hold on,

696
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:25,180
I hold a timer and I hope the
time one by one you just turn

697
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,600
vegetables.

698
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,433
That's amazing.

699
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,990
[inaudible] maker.

700
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,010
But then there's a guy that you didn't
hold that choke long enough and it wasn't

701
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:33,780
lined up right.

702
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,613
He's look,

703
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,833
oh,

704
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,193
you're like fuck.

705
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,050
You got to put them in
another arm trying to,

706
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,741
you're like,

707
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:40,574
oh shit.

708
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,820
Get change it to an arm
triangle and you fucking,

709
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:43,971
oh,

710
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,260
I need 15 more seconds.

711
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,830
Fuck.

712
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,120
The cops are showing them God damn.

713
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,140
And then you let them go on then.

714
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,720
So basically you guys want
to be like fake superhero.

715
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,830
He's a vigilante.

716
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,391
Going to be super,

717
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:54,590
there's a sick play.

718
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:58,040
There's a sick play called the
Toyer that's called veggies.

719
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,330
Look,

720
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,800
there's festivals
everywhere and they're like,

721
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,980
detectives are just like out.

722
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,950
They're all bad guys.

723
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,530
They're all bad guys.

724
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,111
Yeah,

725
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:09,780
exactly.

726
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,430
All the festivals would I go
to jail for holding the tires?

727
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,910
It's like Jujitsu.

728
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:14,744
Dexter.

729
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,511
I'll tell you what,

730
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:18,270
I'm more excited for them to
even pack y'all Mayweather is,

731
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:22,050
I've been talking Shit to count about
his taekwondo days for years now.

732
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,370
His wife has proof,

733
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:24,120
I guess,

734
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,490
of what look at the past.

735
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,840
So yeah,

736
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,010
there are pictures of me.

737
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,550
Ah,

738
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,460
she has pictures of them
probably flying through the air.

739
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:33,210
Killing a cow.

740
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,140
That's nothing to be proud of.

741
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,430
If you have a shiny Sol,

742
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:38,940
like that's terrible.

743
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,670
You got to pick your knee up.

744
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,970
You have a,

745
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,380
nope.

746
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:43,980
See,

747
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,390
it's not bad,

748
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,990
but you have an inherent flaw in your
technique that probably was never,

749
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,130
never explained to you for 49 no,

750
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,973
it ain't bad.

751
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,620
It's pretty good.

752
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,453
It's just not right.

753
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,390
I wouldn't want to get hit by that.

754
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,850
I wouldn't want to get
hit by hitting them.

755
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,010
Riding a shaft.

756
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,970
That's where you would get hit.

757
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,871
What did you,

758
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:04,920
did you really get a black belt?

759
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,970
I was a master.

760
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,323
Come on,

761
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,343
come on.

762
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,520
I don't know what he's really
good about his rank master.

763
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:12,354
What does that mean?

764
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,863
Let me back.

765
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,723
I went back to the,

766
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,133
how long did you train?

767
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,660
Probably seven years straight.

768
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,040
Seven years straight.

769
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:20,874
And where were you living?

770
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,921
All through college.

771
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:23,754
All through college.

772
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,150
You must have been training when I met
you then and then three years after it by

773
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:27,480
just,

774
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,590
just stop and I wasn't,

775
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,020
I wasn't sparring that I'd
probably stop just then.

776
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,510
So when did you get her black belt?

777
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:34,380
Uh,

778
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,730
in 1987

779
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,150
I used to being serious there.

780
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,780
Are you being serious?

781
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,350
Show me.

782
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,140
Show me a real front lake
side for re Hobble Shit.

783
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,033
Oh Bullshit.

784
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,520
Well just this from
here and just throw it.

785
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,653
Sure.

786
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,760
Let me see the spinning one though.

787
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,420
The woods.

788
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,790
The spinner one kick.

789
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,060
Yeah,

790
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,530
that's my favorite that he does.

791
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,431
It's my favorite.

792
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:56,240
Too Old.

793
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,790
Oh dear you.

794
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,190
You just,

795
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,450
all you have to do different now.

796
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:00,261
All you're doing wrong.

797
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:00,410
It's,

798
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,460
you're coming up.

799
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,570
You're foot is going up from the
ground like in almost like a half moon.

800
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,870
Yeah.

801
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,630
You want to get your knee up higher.

802
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,700
That's one of the cool
things about those genes.

803
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,710
Tell him never saw him compete.

804
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,740
I was competing with her.

805
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,590
I have to find my library of video.

806
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,530
I'll show you all that
trophies will actually keep.

807
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:21,831
I gave,

808
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:22,970
my trouble is to Jeremy.

809
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,430
I had the melted down
to the local orphanage.

810
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,850
We were basically,

811
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,710
we were probably in the
same weight class is,

812
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:34,690
which is so confusing.

813
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,200
I traveled all over the world.

814
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,500
Country at least same Aau didn't you?

815
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,210
I thought all style really.

816
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:41,910
Cause I was fun.

817
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,710
Merican taekwondo championships.

818
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,670
I did that.

819
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,570
I did get WTF dude,

820
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:48,530
I'm standing right here.

821
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,400
I don't throw the kick into your knees.

822
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:52,790
Up Hot.

823
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,030
Lift your knee up way high past
your waist and then throw the kick.

824
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,590
Yes,

825
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,470
me up first and then don't
look over your stomach.

826
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,520
Look over your shoulder.

827
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,411
Yeah,

828
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:04,940
but knee first here.

829
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:05,774
Hold on.

830
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,370
This fucking hysterical.

831
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,673
This

832
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,010
while I'm drunk.

833
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,960
I can't watch

834
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,710
my park pass to Joe was going to go off.

835
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,141
Dude.

836
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:22,971
Genes on genes.

837
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:25,580
On genes up here,

838
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,300
up here,

839
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,630
up here.

840
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,030
So flexible pipe companion from here.

841
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,740
Turn your shoulder to the right.

842
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:32,210
Turn your shoulder to
the right to the right.

843
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:33,044
Now extent,

844
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,610
extent straight.

845
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:35,600
Don't look over your stomach.

846
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,630
Look over your shoulder like this.

847
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,570
Like that.

848
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,200
That's how you look.

849
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,790
I know that's not yet flexible.

850
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,411
Flexible.

851
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:42,831
You're fine.

852
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:43,611
Left right from here.

853
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:44,444
Watch.

854
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,650
Oh sons.

855
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,000
Damn.

856
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,360
Even in the eds,

857
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,730
fucking chuck Norris blushing.

858
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,120
Lift your knee up and then kick.

859
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,960
I still think John Claude van Damme
beats the fuck out of both of you.

860
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,170
Then kick watch that one too.

861
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,501
Okay.

862
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,090
Ready?

863
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,720
I'm not mad at Joe's format all.

864
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,090
No,

865
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:04,880
I never saw you.

866
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,190
Never heard of you know,

867
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,280
but heard of you ever.

868
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,173
You Bro.

869
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,143
Not doing any

870
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,653
title.

871
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:13,621
Do you Eddie,

872
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:14,490
you buy believe him.

873
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,970
Why would he let me be very clear.

874
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,180
I actually wouldn't lie about winning.

875
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:20,751
Just don't think you.

876
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:21,720
I think you did taekwondo.

877
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,030
Thank you.

878
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,540
Anything you like a blue belt or
something at the time when you were in the

879
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,990
national office that will be using that
you won the nationals as a black girl.

880
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,850
I fought the,

881
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,240
I fought hard to believe.

882
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,710
I'm throwing it up here.

883
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:34,923
I'm like this.

884
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,920
I'm never like this.

885
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,980
Look at Joe's ass.

886
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:37,830
When he throws the kick,

887
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,830
it's just looking at it.

888
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,620
Don't look at,

889
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,421
don't look at the foot.

890
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:45,210
He has a set of hunting and look at
the foot do's on right into the glutes.

891
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,860
Look deeply into them.

892
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,031
Dude,

893
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:50,110
I'd love to see our
actual taekwondo match,

894
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:51,380
shrink Callen and relevant.

895
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,720
I would just stare at their asses.

896
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,810
Do it my barbells,

897
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,690
huck and monster.

898
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,441
They're awesome,

899
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:58,890
right?

900
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,191
Yeah.

901
00:26:59,191 --> 00:26:59,341
Well,

902
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:00,180

903
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,200
Yeah.
