1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,700
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,500
I remember the first time
I got caught speeding.

3
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:07,430
I was 16 and I just didn't have the money.

4
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:09,680
So I thought if I broke down in tears,

5
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:10,514
the copper,

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,740
no,

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,060
of course he just fucking farming.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,130
And the worst thing is

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,570
my brother is a cop and he reported it
to my brother and then my brother teased

10
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:27,060
me in the near future.

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,610
My brother used to do
awful things as my brother.

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,790
My brother's named Denny nugent
and I think that's a bad site.

13
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,320
He's a member of the rod squad now.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,700
And uh,

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,750
I got,

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,100
I got,

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,960
I was driving home and it's a 17,

18
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:42,360
which is still not the legal
age to drink in Australia.

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,460
And I'm driving home
and I had two beers now.

20
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:46,710
I would have been under the limit,

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,291
but still,

22
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,500
I'm not even allowed to have
two beers in me because I'm 17.

23
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,460
Right.

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,241
I get pulled up,

25
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:52,230
I get breathalyzed.

26
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:52,831
The guy goes,

27
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:53,790
please breathe into the tube.

28
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:54,270
And I said,

29
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,070
my brother was a sergeant at that stage.

30
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:56,941
And I was like,

31
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:57,040
okay,

32
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,311
go,

33
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:57,791
you know,

34
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,120
uh,

35
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,440
denny nugent had nugent does a

36
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,900
right and that you guys know,

37
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:02,734
I never heard of him.

38
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,783
Right.

39
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,680
So he goes off to his vehicle,

40
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:07,480
is there for like 15 minutes.

41
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,470
I'm just sitting in the car,

42
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:11,950
just panicking now he
comes back out and he goes,

43
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,690
step out of the vehicle
or was there a problem?

44
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,790
Anything over just step out
of the vehicle right now.

45
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:16,624
So step out,

46
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,260
he cuffs me and smacks me
under the bonnet of the car.

47
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,620
Right.

48
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,310
And I thought,

49
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,660
oh Jesus Christ,

50
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,830
fuck,

51
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,331
fuck,

52
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:25,830
fuck.

53
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,311
Like this.

54
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:26,810
Right.

55
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,100
And then I and my brother laugh

56
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,950
being on the radio,

57
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,730
like he's actually gone back
to his car radio station,

58
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,230
talked to my brother and he said,

59
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:35,160
scare the shit out of him,

60
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:35,994
you know what I mean?

61
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,980
Because it's cops and they go,

62
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,080
I was just joking with you.

63
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,640
I'm wiping tears away
from where I was like,

64
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:42,510
good job guys.

65
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:42,991
Well done.

66
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:43,824
Thanks.

67
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,000
Hunting is just doing
the same thing but on a,

68
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,410
on a more base level.

69
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,940
Just on a smaller level

70
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,021
in a way.

71
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:53,640
Yeah,

72
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,480
you're just doing it.

73
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:54,691
I mean,

74
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:56,820
you cutting out the middleman
and you're cutting out,

75
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,900
you cut out the middleman and the
animals live in completely wild.

76
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,650
This is like a concept behind hunting
that certain types of people do.

77
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:04,730
It's called fair chase,

78
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,840
and what that means is that you're not
dealing with a fenced in environment,

79
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,800
that you're only hunting an animal
that's truly wild wild animal.

80
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:13,820
They can go wherever it wants.

81
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,880
So in order to harvest this animal,

82
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:19,430
you have to figure out how
to get close enough to it.

83
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,390
You got to stock it,

84
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,310
you got a,

85
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,890
you know,

86
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,720
you gotta understand
where the wind's blowing.

87
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,600
Like there's a lot of factors involved
and when you take that animal,

88
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:31,070
most likely that animal would not have
even known you existed until it died out

89
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:31,491
of nowhere.

90
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:34,250
It just dies and it's
the most ethical way.

91
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,620
But that animal's still scared as fuck.

92
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:37,490
If it sees a person.

93
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,920
The reason banks is people
like me that will shoot it

94
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,800
right now.

95
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:42,371
I see that.

96
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,230
Where's that bit?

97
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,600
You know,

98
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,433
just chilling out,

99
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,760
waiting to and has seen it.

100
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,190
It hasn't just seen his friends
be slaughtered and hung up.

101
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,531
Yeah,

102
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:50,460
it's not trapped,

103
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,060
you know,

104
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,080
it's a wild animal.

105
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,550
You're going out and
getting a wild animal,

106
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,230
but it's also wild animal.

107
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:57,900
That's most of the time they're aware
of people and then they don't want to be

108
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,734
anywhere near us.

109
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,700
The real,

110
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,400
the real tripper is when you can go
and you could see a wild animal that

111
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:07,360
probably never saw a fucking human being
like go up to the Yukon or some shit

112
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,540
and then they freak out a,

113
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,980
they don't even know
what the fuck you are.

114
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,300
A caribou.

115
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,620
Caribou will just look at you like,

116
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,454
what the fuck is this?

117
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,700
Sometimes antelopes will come towards
people because they don't know what the

118
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:19,534
fuck they are.

119
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,170
Yeah.

120
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,471
They're like,

121
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,304
what the fuck are you?

122
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,540
I never seen one of you before.

123
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,374
And then

124
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,480
point blank.

125
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,200
Yeah.

126
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
Well not that close.

127
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,450
You just don't get that close,

128
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,920
but they will look at you.

129
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,460
But sometimes antelopes had encountered
people and sometimes Caribou encounter

130
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:36,670
people and once they've encountered
people they would get way touch here.

131
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,583
Yeah.

132
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,660
Do you have a catchphrase when you hunt?

133
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,073
When you hit one?

134
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,000
I need one.

135
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,953
Let's

136
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,610
Blam Blam we eat.

137
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,453
Inhale,

138
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,793
that's awesome.

139
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,090
That's the perfect one for pig hunting.

140
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,770
You know what I realized?

141
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I realized a long time ago that cops and
security guards do filler talk and they

142
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:13,650
do filler talk so that
you won't talk to them.

143
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,600
So if a,

144
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,660
if a cop pulls you over and goes

145
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:25,270
a license and ID plays a license and
registration please and then just sits

146
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:27,774
there.

147
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,310
You'll start going,

148
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:29,990
hey man,

149
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,210
what?

150
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,561
What,

151
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:30,861
what,

152
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:31,531
what I do,

153
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:34,440
or I was just keeping up
the flow of traffic I wrote,

154
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,900
but instead they always
come up and they go,

155
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,561
sir,

156
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,060
when I go need you do for me right now,

157
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,060
go ahead and get your license
and registration out for me.

158
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:42,331
Okay?

159
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:45,450
Right now and meanwhile they're
doing this kind of pattern.

160
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,220
That doesn't mean anything.

161
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,480
What I'm gonna need you to do for me
right now is to go ahead and get your

162
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:52,180
license.

163
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,050
That doesn't mean anything other
than license and registration.

164
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,460
They keep a nice sort of white noise buzz,

165
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,020
I should call it blue noise noise.

166
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,070
Cops make that stop you from going,

167
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:05,530
what?

168
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,170
What?

169
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,481
Hey,

170
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:10,260
I was just pulling out of my car like
they don't want to hear that bullshit,

171
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:15,261
so they just keep that low grade talk
going because it's only the cops that do

172
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:20,391
the for me right now and a lot of preamble
into when I'm going to have to ask

173
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,760
you to do for me right now.

174
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,580
So go ahead and get your license and.

175
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,101
Okay.

176
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:26,934
Right now,

177
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,700
do you ever speak that way to anybody?

178
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,430
I mean if I wanted you
to pass me the salt,

179
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:32,760
what I,

180
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,050
what I go Joe,

181
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,680
what I'm going to have to go ahead
and do is ask you to pass me the salt.

182
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:37,921
Okay.

183
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:38,754
Right now.

184
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,010
Or when I just say pass me the salt,

185
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,170
I can't hang out with them anymore.

186
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,740
It's just too many words.

187
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:45,574
Oh Great.

188
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,590
I'm convinced they talked.

189
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:49,500
So you don't go.

190
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:49,920
What?

191
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,270
Why am I turning around?

192
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:51,451
Well,

193
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,231
what's this mean?

194
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:52,310
Well,

195
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,220
I didn't do anything.

196
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:53,760
Yeah,

197
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,150
yeah,

198
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,361
no,

199
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:55,141
I totally understand.

200
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:56,710
But something that lasts for six hours.

201
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:00,650
So it seems like fuck boners
that lasts for six hours.

202
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,000
We've talked about that.

203
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,300
All the problem.

204
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,803
It's a problem.

205
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,690
That's crazy.

206
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,080
Did you wear a fanny pack or something
to like actually just took one last

207
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,321
night.

208
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:13,430
So I'm on it right now.

209
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,830
Or you

210
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,610
feel uncomfortable?

211
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,910
I'm amazed that you could
feel comfortable over here.

212
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,600
No,

213
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,433
he's breathing.

214
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,640
So you're saying you went out last
night or did you just stay home alone?

215
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:31,580
Sometimes you just want to
let everybody know what's up.

216
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,320
I got a massage last night,

217
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,810
so I just did it before that

218
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,000
massage in quotes,

219
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:38,834
air quotes,

220
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,840
creeper.

221
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,210
It's just better that way.

222
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,700
Listen,

223
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,280
we were living in trying times.

224
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,300
He just wanted to fuck with the massage.

225
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,680
What an asshole fucking snake coming
out of the top of past a turtle head.

226
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,193
What does that.

227
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,390
What is the

228
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,943
pink?

229
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,590
Well,

230
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,600
you know what?

231
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,810
We need to talk about everything.

232
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:06,611
That's the problem.

233
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:07,550
You can't just talk.

234
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,540
Only about passionate people.

235
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,490
Get bored of the same content
for peaches over a number.

236
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,660
Then you brought up the boner.

237
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,250
Anyway,

238
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,083
listen,

239
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,760
I would bring it up to.

240
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,270
You're welcome.

241
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,940
If I was to check,

242
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,670
I'd been bringing up boners
all day playing to me boners.

243
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,280
Do you know in the comments later?

244
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:24,980
I'd be like,

245
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,641
is it like,

246
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:26,920
does it give you like a whispery,

247
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,180
like whistling in your ears?

248
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,180
No,

249
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,180
the demon boners on its way between
the worlds opens up just a creek and

250
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,410
spirits come flying through
your fucking nervous system.

251
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,313
Spirits.

252
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,213
You feel them?

253
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,143
Yeah,

254
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,611
potentially.

255
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:46,820
I think that I was,

256
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,100
you know,

257
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,100
we're now discovering that
it's good for so many things,

258
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:54,370
you know,

259
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,260
therapeutically for addictions,

260
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:57,160
for depression,

261
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,440
for ptsd and that sort of thing.

262
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:00,970
And that's all to the good.

263
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,600
But we shouldn't make the mistake of
thinking Iowasca is only for sick people.

264
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:08,951
You know,

265
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:09,241
it's,

266
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:09,670
it's,

267
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,670
we're all wounded and we all
need to understand something
about our relationship

268
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:15,814
to nature,

269
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:21,270
potentially the paradigms that are
emerging in Iowaska tourism or these more,

270
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:23,831
you know,

271
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:24,011
these.

272
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:27,100
I was centered spiritual
communities in the states.

273
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,290
Potentially this has the,

274
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,341
uh,

275
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:34,240
this may transform mental
health care in this country.

276
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:39,241
It may transform psychiatry and from
that it might transform medicine and it

277
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:44,290
might actually transform all these other
institutions that we have to deal with

278
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:49,291
whose values have become
twisted over 2000 years of,

279
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,320
of bullshit and,

280
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,410
and indoctrination.

281
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,613
Uh,

282
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,533
you know,

283
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,260
these institutions are not
going away and they're fine.

284
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:03,261
They just need to rediscover a moral
dimension to the consequences of their

285
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:04,830
action,

286
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,240
if that makes any sense.

287
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,470
You know,

288
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,470
our cleverness far exceeds our
wisdom and that's a problem.

289
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:17,520
That's the problem we've
got to become wise.

290
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,900
And when we couple that with our
ingenuity and our cleverness,

291
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:25,500
then we'll be on the way
toward saving the planet,

292
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,820
saving ourselves.
