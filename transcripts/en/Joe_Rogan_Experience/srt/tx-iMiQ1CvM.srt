1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,803
Hey fuckers,

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm tweeting at the same time.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,160
Here we go.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,570
I wonder if Goldberg assuming for that.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,800
Here we go.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,301
That's a shit,

7
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:16,134
right?

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,040
Yeah.

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,790
Oh,

10
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,940
we shouldn't probably shouldn't
start every podcast going.

11
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,640
Here we go.

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,170
We got a few sound issues folks.

13
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,300
So it took us some time.

14
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,620
We got it together though.

15
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,120
Um,

16
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,540
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by ting.

17
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,860
Uh,

18
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,880
I've met several people
now who've switched over to
Tang ever since we started

19
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,990
doing this in the podcast and uh,

20
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,330
all of them have been happy.

21
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,880
And then they're also that
they definitely saved money.

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,750
Um,

23
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,440
also,

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,860
uh,

25
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,660
date they get a great service.

26
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:46,500
If you don't know what tango is,

27
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,140
10 is the cell phone service
that uses a sprint backbone,

28
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,870
but they don't do it with
all the other shenanigans.

29
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:53,550
Like most cell phone companies have,

30
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,010
like they use the network
of a major company,

31
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:58,290
but the way they have it set up as a,

32
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,970
you can cancel anytime you want.

33
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,600
Look what they just added it
to the website coming soon.

34
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:03,434
Apple iPhone.

35
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,843
Oh Wow.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,833
Look at that sign.

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,840
You could sign up right now if you go
to [inaudible] dot com slash devices uh

38
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,520
Huh.

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,180
Yeah,

40
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,800
that's a,

41
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,470
that's bad ass.

42
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:13,831
That's great.

43
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,241
I'm good then.

44
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:14,731
I'm glad they,

45
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:14,851
uh,

46
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,391
they did that.

47
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,440
Most sprint carries out now,

48
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:16,710
right?

49
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,190
Yeah.

50
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,290
Joey just switch Joey.

51
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,030
That's right.

52
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,550
I'm so,

53
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,700
I have you talked to him about it?

54
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:21,390
I wonder if he'd like,

55
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,223
he loves it.

56
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,543
It's like a,

57
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:23,911
you know,

58
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:24,780
it's music too.

59
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,920
He doesn't have to have a,

60
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:26,580
um,

61
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:26,821
uh,

62
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,110
an iPod anymore.

63
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,520
All these phones do that now,

64
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:30,120
man.

65
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,481
These,

66
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:30,780
uh,

67
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,280
the new cell phones today are
like mini computers and uh,

68
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,660
never is that more true than the,

69
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,520
um,

70
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,110
nevers that more true than
the Samsung Galaxy s three.

71
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:40,944
And the note,

72
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,360
those things are giant.

73
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,170
This note thing is this
mega fucking phone.

74
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,340
It's amazing.

75
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,560
And it does everything
you get online with it.

76
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:51,990
You can record voice memos with it.

77
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:52,501
You can,

78
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:52,800
you know,

79
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,910
download apps.

80
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,330
It used to be that if you were going
to get a Google phone over an iPhone,

81
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:57,901
you were fucked.

82
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:01,330
But now if you're into a big
screen because the Google phone,

83
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:01,771
so it really,

84
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,660
the only way to go if you want to have
one phone that does everything that you

85
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:11,661
can watch movies or watch a movie on
an iPhone is a not quite as pleasurable

86
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:12,774
experience,

87
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,530
you know.

88
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,740
But watching the one on one
of those notes that's legit,

89
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,450
like about big enough,

90
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,000
you know,

91
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,200
I take it to the next level.

92
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:20,800
I watched,

93
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,370
uh,

94
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,950
the new funny or die movie I Steve,

95
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:27,760
which is a ridiculous movie about Steve
Jobs because they just wanted to make

96
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:30,390
the first Steve jobs movie and it's so,

97
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:34,690
Riddick has Justin Long place Steve
Jobs who was also in the commercials for

98
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,610
apple growing up as the,

99
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,091
you know,

100
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,460
the Geek and the stuff anyways,

101
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,303
but they,

102
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,590
they only have it online.

103
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:43,630
You can't watch it anywhere.

104
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,090
So you could just stream it
though using an apple TV.

105
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:46,781
Have you done that yet?

106
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,060
Where you're just on your iPhone,

107
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,340
you're like,

108
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,521
oh,

109
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:49,420
I want to watch this movie.

110
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,740
You just send it to your TV.

111
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,370
Yes.

112
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,210
That's so great.

113
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,580
That's the best thing.

114
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,240
I wasn't caught air share
or whatever the fuck.

115
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:55,700
Yeah.

116
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,640
I don't know what it's called.

117
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,720
That is pretty bad ass.

118
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,140
Yeah,

119
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,340
it's a pretty amazing idea.

120
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,860
Really.

121
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,131
Right.

122
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,600
You've put photos on your
television with Apple TV.

123
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,580
It's amazing.

124
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,300
I love it.

125
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,660
Yeah.

126
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:04,991
I'm a,

127
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:05,260
I'm,

128
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,651
well,

129
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:05,981
I just,

130
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:08,050
I'm a big fan of technology as you are.

131
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,540
It's just so cool when new shit comes out.

132
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,420
Like Dunkin Trust was
telling me about oculus rift.

133
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,240
This is virtual reality
shit they're working on now.

134
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,370
Yeah.

135
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,620
We're supposed to have him on a podcast.

136
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,640
Oh my goodness,

137
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,503
dude.

138
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,141
They have a,

139
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,200
a one where the m and Omni
Directional treadmill.

140
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,200
So the treadmill goes in any
direction and you're running,

141
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,940
I'll talk about this on the plane.

142
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,823
Okay.

143
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,010
How have we talked about,

144
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,350
see the video?

145
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,550
We watched a video,

146
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,331
the military,

147
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:33,570
uh,

148
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,410
talk about on Nearpod.

149
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,590
No,

150
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,230
you're probably guys we did a long time
ago and that's why it's weird because I

151
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:41,190
was listening to old podcasts of me
and you and there's so many things that

152
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:42,990
we've talked about that I thought,

153
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,220
like we've talked about recently.

154
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:44,521
I was like,

155
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:44,701
wait,

156
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:45,750
I've never heard this before.

157
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,340
We are stoners,

158
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:48,090
dude.

159
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,680
What do you mean repeat story?

160
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,720
There's no way around it.

161
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:51,841
No,

162
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:52,051
I know.

163
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:52,321
But like,

164
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:53,820
this is a perfect example.

165
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,703
I was like,

166
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,180
I,

167
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,531
I've,

168
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:56,250
I've seen this weight.

169
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,550
I've seen it.

170
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,941
Oh wait,

171
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,590
we did this like a long time ago.

172
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:58,801
Well,

173
00:03:58,801 --> 00:03:59,820
we do so much.

174
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,571
Isn't it ridiculous?

175
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:01,740
I don't want to fucking podcast.

176
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,810
We've done 351 podcast now.

177
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,290
Yeah,

178
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,640
that's a lot of Goddamn podcasts.

179
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:07,060
Himes three hour,

180
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,430
same stories over and over again.

181
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,210
My brain is not sharp enough
to not do that at the trial.

182
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
We can't remember.

183
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,660
I think we're way better at it now.

184
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,490
We're way better at it
now than we used to be.

185
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,900
Right.

186
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,150
You know,

187
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,220
I used to tell the same goddamn
story every three weeks.

188
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,211
Uh,

189
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:24,211
rogan.ting.com save 25 bucks off of
either cell phone service or one of their

190
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:25,600
bad ass android phones.

191
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,321
Uh,

192
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:30,190
another one of the cool things about ting
is that they give you credit on unused

193
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:30,670
service.

194
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,010
This is like my favorite thing
that I've ever heard a company do.

195
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,320
You use less than you thought you would.

196
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:39,020
Tin Drops you down to the next
level and a credit to you.

197
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,330
The difference on your next bill.

198
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,243
It's amazing.

199
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,730
Yeah,

200
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,170
that's,

201
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,003
that's beautiful.

202
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,380
They,

203
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,810
yeah,

204
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,870
they charge you for what you use.

205
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,120
And if you don't use
as much as you thought,

206
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,103
they hook you up.

207
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,390
It's really a how every
company should work.

208
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,730
You could this like this idea that
companies have to like squeeze the last

209
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:02,680
dollar out of you that they have to lock
you up and contracts and if you leave

210
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,840
the contract costs you
hundreds of dollars.

211
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,520
That's some creepy shit,

212
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,270
man.

213
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,140
It's creepy.

214
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,530
Oh,

215
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,140
but in two years you'll be
eligible for a new phone.

216
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,951
Are you ready?

217
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:15,090
And they just suck into
the little hole thing.

218
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,940
Doesn't do that.

219
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,280
Go to rogan.ting.com
save yourself some cash

220
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,490
and they're thinking that's
just really cool to uh,

221
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,220
they don't have any limits on bandwidth.

222
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:25,050
They don't throttle your bandwidth.

223
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,980
So like if you are a heavy
user and you're on a plan,

224
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,480
you know exactly how much it will cost.

225
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:33,270
There's no overage cause like a
lot of companies will go like,

226
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,680
oh you went over your amount,

227
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:37,590
we're charging an extra amount
and then it's this per minute.

228
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,521
You're not,

229
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:39,720
you're getting the same amount.

230
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,230
You know what it's that you know
of that you signed up for it.

231
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,460
Right?

232
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,920
Like you're not getting any extra fees
and if you want to use a shitload of,

233
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,341
you know,

234
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:50,040
if you want to spend a lot of
money and use as much data,

235
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,940
none to man,

236
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:54,000
you could if you wanted to and they
wouldn't throttle it or stop it.

237
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,270
Isn't it interesting

238
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,110
that uh,

239
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,480
that bandwidth still can
be expensive in the world?

240
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:00,314
A phones,

241
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,140
like we've totally licked that
shit on the regular Internet,

242
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,440
right?

243
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,240
Like you just get mad bandwidth,

244
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:05,631
man.

245
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,260
You know,

246
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,940
you could get mad bandwidth at home,

247
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,900
but on your phone like,

248
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,010
oh bitch man,

249
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:11,230
we got to ration this shit.

250
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,300
Kind of like AOL.

251
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:13,950
Remember if you went
over your minutes on AOL,

252
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,690
you only had like 400 minutes and if you
went over it with a shit load of money,

253
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,200
I don't remember that at all.

254
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:21,270
All she went over the minutes.

255
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:21,840
It would cost you

256
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,170
money.

257
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,321
Yeah.

258
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:25,110
You had to sit there and look at the clock
the whole time you're on the internet

259
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:27,180
like it's a fucking
bomb about to blow off.

260
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,913
Fuck up.

261
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,330
What did they fuck up?

262
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:32,980
They were on top of the world.

263
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,660
What monkey over there?

264
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,830
I've dropped the ball.

265
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:36,910
All could.

266
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,250
If they adapted and
grew with the Internet,

267
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,020
they could have been Facebook.

268
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,810
Yeah.

269
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,000
We should have been Facebook.

270
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,350
They were the original Facebook.

271
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,990
Aol was the original Facebook.

272
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,170
People would like I am.

273
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,490
People know my space.

274
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,120
Yeah,

275
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,590
well no.

276
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:51,850
It was more like,

277
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,370
yeah,

278
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,280
I guess Facebook is more
like people's friends,

279
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,570
but it was,

280
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,051
it's actually,

281
00:06:56,051 --> 00:06:57,730
it would say even different
because there was been,

282
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,550
there had been nothing like it before.

283
00:06:59,551 --> 00:06:59,950
Right.

284
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,030
Nothing like it exists.

285
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,150
I got laid off AOL many times,

286
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:08,151
son of a bitch or a member directory
searches within 15 miles of my location.

287
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,121
You know,

288
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:12,390
you put it in your address shows who's
online and then you could use to just be

289
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,680
able to chat with those people.

290
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:16,830
Like there's 20 people online
that live five miles near me.

291
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,810
I can tell you go through
their profiles like,

292
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,673
Oh dude,

293
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,160
dude,

294
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,993
oh chick.

295
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,781
You just like,

296
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:21,991
Oh hey,

297
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:22,620
what are you doing?

298
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,690
I actually got laid that way.

299
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,950
I found a girl that lived like
three streets down from me.

300
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,250
I bet you were one of the first thousand
people ever to get laid from AOL.

301
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,470
I probably,

302
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,420
that was like really early.

303
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,141
It was right when,

304
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:34,590
uh,

305
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,080
what year are we talking about it?

306
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,990
I would say 98.

307
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,890
97.

308
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,670
It was right up.

309
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,640
It's when they first invented
like the instant messaging.

310
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,441
It was not what,

311
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:46,140
they didn't invent it,

312
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,160
ICQ or whatever did,

313
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,203
but uh,

314
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,420
where you used to be able to instant
message people and would be an instant

315
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,254
message.

316
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,960
Instant message.

317
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,070
You've got mail,

318
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,370
you've got mail.

319
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,073
They dropped it.

320
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,440
They dropped that ball and Twitter
took over like a motherfucker.

321
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,450
Where's the AOL Guy Now?

322
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,450
He's probably sitting there going,

323
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,353
crying,

324
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,030
maybe made a kajillion dollars and
just gave up on the fucking thing.

325
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,410
I think it still works though,

326
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:13,570
because people still
have AOL email addresses.

327
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah,

328
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,111
I know dude.

329
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,540
It was an AOL email address.

330
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,351
I think I still do.

331
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:21,040
I think I just signed in the other day
on AOL instant messenger because I still

332
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:21,350
use it.

333
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,490
Well I used to use that.

334
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,270
Yeah.

335
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,650
And what was the other one in quake,

336
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:28,130
we used AOL instant messenger
and we used to use a ICQ.

337
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,731
That's right.

338
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:29,930
I see Q is a big one.

339
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,660
We had like a little quick clan names.

340
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,240
It was like who you signed in as us.

341
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,360
The ICQ number.

342
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,840
That was like a 20 digit

343
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,760
number that you have to remember
to remember the fucking number.

344
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,140
What's your ICQ number?

345
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:42,291
Yeah,

346
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:46,010
you'd have it on a like a thing
that you could give out with people.

347
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,460
Like a program that you press it.

348
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,550
It gives up the IQ number.

349
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,630
I secure number here.

350
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,560
Yeah,

351
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,550
the old days folks.

352
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,750
Um,

353
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,770
stamps.com is another one of our podcasts.

354
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,310
Uh,

355
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,980
if you own a business and you
sell shit through the Internet,

356
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,790
you know what,

357
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,680
go into the post offices.

358
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,490
Like it's ridiculous.

359
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:03,330
It takes a lot of time.

360
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,100
We should do a stamps.com podcast.

361
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,270
What do you mean?

362
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,060
You just said stamps.com is
another one of our podcast.

363
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,501
Did I say it?

364
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:11,010
It's another one I would podcast sponsors.

365
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,873
I forgot the word,

366
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:12,990
but wait,

367
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,640
w we should do a podcast all about stamps,

368
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,310
about stamps.com all about stamps period.

369
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,670
Call it like a podcast challenge where
you have to do a podcast for three hours

370
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:22,710
about something that would suck.

371
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,230
Suck pranking stamps.com
employees or something like it.

372
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,073
What else do we do?

373
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,040
We get after like 15 minutes we'd be dry.

374
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,630
Liddy we will be like,

375
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,051
you know what,

376
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:37,070
there's no stamps.com and Africa
and Africa is fucking crazy,

377
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,350
right to hoot.

378
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,340
But you could have stamps.com in Africa.

379
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,410
You could cause it's all
based on your computer.

380
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:44,730
You print out your own postage.

381
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,900
So you could be in Africa,

382
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:46,734
in the tent,

383
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,940
print your own stamps out and give it to
a horse and tell him to send it to some

384
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:52,920
of these horses in Africa or they'd
just eat them when I get one.

385
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,131
Yeah,

386
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:53,551
I don't know.

387
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,270
They'd probably,

388
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,350
there probably is no animal.

389
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:55,650
It's egret.

390
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:55,980
Oh,

391
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,760
eat zebra.

392
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,593
Did you know that?

393
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,330
I did not know that people a zebra,

394
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,360
but apparently people actually
like the taste of zebra.

395
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,410
Well if you're like super hungry
you would eat any animal you saw.

396
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:06,750
Oh,

397
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,550
I'm sure you'd be like grabbing mice.

398
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,560
You'd be cats are fucked.

399
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,020
Yeah.

400
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,470
Would you'd eat everything
you'd eat my sud,

401
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,343
everything you could.

402
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,000
People that are in like those prisons,

403
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,520
those a Korean prison
camps that you hear about.

404
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:22,050
Like that's one of the things I say they
eat rats and they get sick because they

405
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,200
little eat a raw rat,

406
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,310
but they're so hungry.

407
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:25,300
They just have to eat.

408
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,223
They have to eat.

409
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,830
You didn't have bullies in your villages?

410
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:28,970
He just had kids at eight.

411
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:29,804
Yeah,

412
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,550
Dude.

413
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,610
Times times used to
suck hard but not today.

414
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,360
Today you got something like stamps.com
and your lazy ass can just sit there and

415
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:44,361
you computer and print up
all your bullshit and send
your stuff out and not have

416
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,050
to wait in line to get everything weighed.

417
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,280
They also include a,

418
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,060
if you click on the microphone in the
upper right hand corner of the website and

419
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:51,660
um,

420
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,660
enter in the code word j r e they give
you a special offer with a free digital

421
00:10:57,061 --> 00:11:01,440
scale and a $55 in postage and coupons.

422
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,220
Uh,

423
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,280
it's really easy to use in
a few [inaudible] if you
buy any one of those death

424
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:05,761
squad dot.

425
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:07,470
T V t shirts that uh,

426
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,340
Brian Creates.

427
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,920
And I understand that cat
number three is on the way.

428
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,331
Yeah,

429
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:13,580
it was up till seven 30
this last night doing it.

430
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,080
I've tried to finish it out and try
to do the final design by this week.

431
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,340
Powerful cat number three.

432
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:19,880
Um,

433
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,713
so if you've,

434
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,880
if you've bought those before in the past,

435
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,370
then you have uh,

436
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,480
enjoyed how well stamps.com works.

437
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,270
It's fucking a beautiful thing
if you have your own business.

438
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,433
And uh,

439
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,560
if you look at it for something to do
like making a business and selling shit

440
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:33,981
online,

441
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:36,590
it's probably a pretty fucking
cool way to own your own business.

442
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,111
It really is.

443
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:37,610
Yeah.

444
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,340
If you think about if you actually
have a cool product to feel like,

445
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,700
especially if you're someone like an
artist or you're someone who knows how to

446
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:46,880
make something that people want to buy
and you can put your stuff for sale

447
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:50,390
online and then just sell it and
just do it all out of your house,

448
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:51,190
like your,

449
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,610
your house becomes your business.

450
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,950
I told Esther this like almost a year ago

451
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,710
because she was looking for ideas to make
money that she should just sit there,

452
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,170
draw like every hour,

453
00:12:00,171 --> 00:12:01,370
just draw another drawing.

454
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,740
So each one of those drugs for $15 online,

455
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,011
you know,

456
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:06,770
just like sit there and just
make drawings or do something,

457
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,400
you know,

458
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
that's a shit wage.

459
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,280
That's like $15 an hour for,

460
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,760
well I wouldn't take an hour.

461
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:17,550
It's going to take out
like a good percent profit.

462
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,061
Well,

463
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:21,660
profit is going to get eaten up because
everything $15 how much does it cost to

464
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:23,040
get it going to cost to send it?

465
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:23,791
Well,

466
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:23,911
no,

467
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,040
you add shipping and
stuff like that to it.

468
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,790
Oh you asked?

469
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,420
Yeah.

470
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,510
You clever bastard and I think
you should be a business mogul.

471
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:32,450
I don't understand why you're not I,

472
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,600
yeah,

473
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,171
but like,

474
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:34,381
like,

475
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:34,861
and she did,

476
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,720
I think she did do a few drawings on set,

477
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,940
but like they're just
like what sites like Etsy,

478
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,670
s y or there's like
fiverr.com which is a website.

479
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:43,620
You can get anyone to do anything for $5.

480
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,000
It,

481
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,700
it's,

482
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,090
yeah,

483
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,930
it's just fuck fiber.

484
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,580
And it's actually one
of the best things ever.

485
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:47,731
Like,

486
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:49,320
like if you need something
real quick and you're like,

487
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:49,471
no,

488
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:50,220
I need a logo.

489
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,720
It's a cat pooping please.

490
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:52,560
$5 you know?

491
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:54,090
And then there was somebody
was so fun and yeah,

492
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:54,840
it's really cool.

493
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,381
But you know,

494
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:58,830
things like that you can sit there
and start a home business pretty easy.

495
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,910
Maybe not something that would pay for
everything at the start that at least

496
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,290
extra income coming in,

497
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,100
you know?

498
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,770
Yeah,

499
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,030
no,

500
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,810
I know what you mean.

501

We started carrying a raw foods like
walnut and almond cashew butter.

525
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,150
Ooh,

526

529
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,380
Um,

530
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,951
it's a,

531
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:16,970
it's delicious too,

532
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:17,241
man.

533
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:17,481
It's,

534
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:17,640
uh,

535
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,070
it's,

536
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:23,070
it's a trilogy butter and it's
just a really fucking healthy nuts.

537
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,880
Not like the ones that,

538
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,200
yeah,

539
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,430
no nut butters.

540
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,570
They're uh,

541
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,740
they're some of the more nutritious
and versatile foods on the planet.

542
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,330
I was thinking of,

543
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,240
of the website,

544
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,971
I was thinking black,

545
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:35,151
white,

546
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:35,631
and Asian.

547
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:36,464
I didn't know what

548
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,460
Asian nuts,

549
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,930
just like a teapot trilogy Darya.

550
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,700
What,

551
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,350
how much different people's loads
look from different countries.

552
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,200
Do you think there's like
countries that have like different,

553
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,490
like parts of the world,

554
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:50,990
like you think you,

555
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,030
like there's a person out
there who can analyze,

556
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:54,110
come again,

557
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,140
like that's when you know you're
a whore when like someone can,

558
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,600
you could taste come like a fine vintage,

559
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,081
you know,

560
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:00,831
like some,

561
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:01,664
some gals,

562
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,211
you know,

563
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,650
like in can taste wine,

564
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,021
you know,

565
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:05,570
like some people are really good.

566
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,770
Like my friend Matt,

567
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,210
my friend Matt is like a wine,

568
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,900
what are they?

569
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,421
Somali,

570
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:09,770
AA,

571
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,603
whatever they call them.

572
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,240
Super Connoisseur.

573
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,680
Yeah,

574
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,090
he has like a room in his house.

575
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,210
You can give him a glass of wine.

576
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:16,490
You could tell you what
kind of wine it is.

577
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,300
I wonder if it's a gal out there that
can tell you where the loads come for

578
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,910
sure.

579
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,321
She's like,

580
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:21,471
oh,

581
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:22,304
these are Mexican.

582
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,970
I know these are Mexican loans.

583
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,393
Definitely,

584
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,230
definitely South Africa.

585
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,640
She could narrow it down.

586
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,410
Portugal,

587
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,670
north somewhere in northern Europe

588
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,530
with a little bit of checklist,

589
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:35,281
a little wacky in it.

590
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:38,330
And there it gives it that nutty texture.

591
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,420
Um,

592
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,700
we also carry a,

593
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,770
besides food and nutritional supplements
carry a bunch of fitness equipment too.

594
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,530
Um,

595
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,150
we even carry BLENDTEC blenders.

596
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,560
Well we try to do on,

597
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:52,394
on it,

598
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:52,990
add on.

599
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,520
I mean you try to come up with
a name for what the company is.

600
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:55,750
It's,

601
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,690
it's basically like a
human performance website.

602
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,800
I mean that's what it's about.

603
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,281
Like the,

604
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,950
all the fitness equipment is all
stuff for functional strength.

605
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,001
All the,

606
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:05,260
uh,

607
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,090
why you show him the fucking ghost rider.

608
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,271
Well,

609
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:12,110
a lot of people have been talking about
how on it now sells ghost writers weapon

610
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,341
and Oh,

611
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:14,780
I don't have you seen that or not?

612
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,220
Ghost rider had like a chain,

613
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:19,810
didn't know he also had this
when the steel maces that uh,

614
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,530
there's been a lot of people online
showing that it's the exact same thing as

615
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:25,610
the coast writers.

616
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,040
Well what they are folks,

617
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,980
they're not weapons.

618
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,300
So there's way more effective
shit to use as a weapon.

619
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,100
I'm sure you've heard of guns.

620
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:34,970
Yeah.

621
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,803
And uh,

622
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,370
knives and swords and stuff like that.

623
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:37,490
Yeah,

624
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,020
those are better with this is,

625
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:39,561
it gives you,

626
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:39,860
it's a,

627
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,860
this is a steel mace and they give you
like weird functional strength because

628
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:48,050
it's oddly waited with a Macy's is a long,

629
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,270
long steel thick tube.

630
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:50,931
It's very thick,

631
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:52,100
so it's difficult to grab.

632
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,370
And then there's a ball
metal ball at the end of it.

633
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:55,920
And so when do you,

634
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,260
as you wield this around?

635
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,360
Like Karl gotch was a big
believer in the steel mason.

636
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,700
He was a very famous
catch wrestling guy in a,

637
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:04,030
uh,

638
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,270
a fitness guru.

639
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:05,601
He,

640
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:06,140
uh,

641
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,670
he would have these guys
get into tremendous shape
before he even allowed them

642
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,110
to take his,

643
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:12,440
uh,

644
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:12,800
his,

645
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,090
his wrestling classes.

646
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,470
He was like famous for it.

647
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,880
And this is one of the
things that he really loved,

648
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:17,780
but he had a huge one.

649
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:17,931
Man,

650
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:18,860
that guy was a psycho.

651
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,310
There's the clubs as well.

652
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,080
These things are not weapons style.

653
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,120
What they are is because they're weighted.

654
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,601
It's a,

655
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:30,020
it's a handle and then
the weight is all long,

656
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,621
you know,

657
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:31,790
and because it goes,

658
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,500
the longer the clubs are the,

659
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,850
the,

660
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,690
the weirder they are to wheeled around,

661
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,171
you know,

662
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,690
and it gives you this really interesting,

663
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,110
uh,

664
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,000
functional workout,

665
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:41,891
uh,

666
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:43,250
of like your whole body.

667
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:43,670
You could,

668
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,380
you could give you all,

669
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:49,040
it's all like swinging and catching and
controlling and it gives you a good,

670
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,020
with like a

671
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,853
lightweight,

672
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,990
like I use a 25 pounder in each arm.

673
00:17:52,991 --> 00:17:53,101
It's,

674
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,230
it's amazing how,

675
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,900
how much of a workout you get with that.

676
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,890
It's really incredible.

677
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,300
It doesn't seem like that much weight,

678
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,260
ladies.

679
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,350
Good to sit on it and
compare their pussy depth.

680
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,170
Take a little chalk,

681
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,090
Joe,

682
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,480
please don't even try that at home
because if someone died from it,

683
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,443
that could

684
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:16,691
do,

685
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:17,411
can you imagine a girl up?

686
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:18,730
She could get all the way to the bottom.

687
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,341
Sure.

688
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:23,450
Imagine a girl would get one of
those mace balls in her mouth ball.

689
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,020
We said we should try this.

690
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,890
No.

691
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,890
We also sell a kettle burnmar.

692
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,650
Yes,

693
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,390
Amy Schumer and Ari Shaffir.

694
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,800
So either one of them was
a good candidate for us.

695
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,763
Uh,

696
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,621
we have weight vests.

697
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:38,490
Now we have,

698
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:39,040
um,

699
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,230
uh,

700
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,590
a great kettle bell DVD,

701
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:42,210
extreme kettlebell cardio workout,

702
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,643
which is so good.

703
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,360
It's almost impossible to keep in stock.

704
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,380
Keith Webb or the guy who makes it has
a real hard time keeping them in stock

705
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,330
because it's an incredible workout.

706
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,050
I do it with a 35 pound Kettle Bell
and it beats my Dick in the ground.

707
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:55,980
Um,

708
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,870
and the chimpanzee one is the,

709
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,580
is a 35 pounder.

710
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,220
We're going to have some other ones to
come to more of the primal bells anyway.

711
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,241
Use a code name,

712
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:03,900
Rogan,

713
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,540
and save yourself 10 to 10.

714
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,290
What do you laugh now?

715
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,450
Just the idea of you watching a DVD out
outside and you're just dry humping the

716
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:12,360
ground as hard as he can take it.

717
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,270
That's not what I meant.

718
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,060
This is an old cowboy expression.

719
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,150
Kick his dick into the dirt.

720
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,541
Yeah.

721
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,040
I just,

722
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,380
look,

723
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,740
what I really want to do is I really
want to get more fucking endurance so I

724
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:27,574
just,

725
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,550
I do pushups while I
tried to fuck the ground.

726
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,150
That's the move.

727
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,983
It's so fun.

728
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:34,571
Yeah.

729
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:37,690
You imagine if there was a class where
they taught you how to fuck harder?

730
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:38,950
No,

731
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,830
I'll tell you what it is.

732
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,791
I know this girl,

733
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,750
they just went to a yoga rave and that's
exactly what it was just a fuck fest.

734
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,380
It was just,

735
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,500
it was the closest thing to look
that looked like a futuristic cult.

736
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,380
They were doing like Dunkin
owns in it and stuff like that.

737
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:52,250
Like a home.

738
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,790
It was just as people all wearing neon
and having like glow sticks while doing

739
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,300
yoga and half the guys had like barely
any clothes on half the girls that barely

740
00:19:59,301 --> 00:19:59,630
any clothes.

741
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,250
It was creepy looking.

742
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,270
They start fucking,

743
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,691
no,

744
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:05,990
but it just because it was so futuristic,

745
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:08,540
like they were oming through it
and like it was this big call,

746
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,530
a cm type thing.

747
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,860
Like it'd be one thing if they did
yoga and just fucked like wild animals.

748
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,610
Yeah.

749
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,470
I think it was borderline
getting to that though.

750
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:15,710
That's,

751
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,640
that's what the people that were there
and you just need goodness step in

752
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,413
plants.

753
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,780
Slowly bring desk squad
people to infiltrate their
organization for the outside.

754
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,610
Let you guys have a really good start.

755
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:30,660
It's an interesting idea.

756
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:32,730
We liked the idea but you're
not fucking each other.

757
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,451
Okay.

758
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:36,510
You guys are like 25 just
stretching out next to each other.

759
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:36,931
Come on.

760
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,100
How come nobody's talking to anybody?

761
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,080
Let's stop with the homes.

762
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,460
If we should do that to that podcast
festival in August or September,

763
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,550
like we're like,

764
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,320
I'm ready.

765
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,310
We're there and it's like all these
fans from all around the real,

766
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,010
from different fans of different podcasts.

767
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,250
We should just like make it like all
the death squad people like overtake it.

768
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:57,400
Like we just have a bunch of
crazy people mixed in with like,

769
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,960
Hey,

770
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,680
I just like tech podcasts.

771
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,380
What are you guys doing?

772
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:00,621
Well,

773
00:21:00,621 --> 00:21:04,400
you know what we could do is we could
do our own desk squad podcast festival.

774
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:04,580
Yeah,

775
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,370
we could easily do that.

776
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,320
We can just take over this one.

777
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,140
Well I would we take over one

778
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,023
because we could be,

779
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,960
why would cause bird,

780
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,000
they're already no.

781
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,840
Well why would he not take over?

782
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:13,674
But we could like,

783
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,170
like they ha they let
them do all the planning.

784
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,120
Like oh they got a good rooms at hotels.

785
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:18,541
They got,

786
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,030
you know like they got that you
want to steal their business?

787
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,231
No,

788
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:21,381
no,

789
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:21,570
no.

790
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,830
I'm just saying like have all
of our fans go there and mob it.

791
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,883
You know what I mean?

792
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,210
Like it's like if you go to a lot of
Palooza and it was all nirvana fans,

793
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,020
you know what I mean?

794
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,410
It's impossible to do because
there's still going to be other fans.

795
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,581
Not If night,

796
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:40,500
if the majority is like 99.9% like
Joe Rogan and desk squad fans.

797
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,450
Well,

798
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,040
there's no way they would ever do that.

799
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,221
Yeah.

800
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:43,820
But Dude,

801
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,070
she always going to get
like all the other fans too.

802
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:46,371
I'll do it.

803
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,710
I have to do is just be in
line to buy tickets first.

804
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,410
Oh yeah.

805
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,350
You know what I mean?

806
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,430
Is it a fine to do it a
finite amount of tickets,

807
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,570
um,

808
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,790
to a point of being able
to stay at the hotel and,

809
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,471
and all that.

810
00:21:57,471 --> 00:21:58,110
Yeah,

811
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,490
but don't you think that their reserve,

812
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:01,020
all those like people,

813
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,480
oh no,

814
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,280
I'm in advance.

815
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,431
No,

816
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:02,581
no.

817
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:04,740
I mean this is a small festival
is this is only our second,

818
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,550
their second year too.

819
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,700
I think that's bad Karma,

820
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,480
I'd think.

821
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:09,661
No,

822
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:09,781
no,

823
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:09,960
no.

824
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,190
It's giving him money.

825
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,930
But even sending our people in there,

826
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,111
no,

827
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:13,620
no,

828
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,040
no.

829
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,873
I'm just saying any of them.

830
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,331
First of all,

831
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:16,560
to many of our people are crazy,

832
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,100
right.

833
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,580
But we,

834
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,790
we have live performances of a desk squad.

835
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,480
Kevin Pereira is pointless and if you
want to have a Joe Rogan one and there's a

836
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:27,900
comedy show the second night across
the street and this huge school,

837
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,400
it's going to be pretty cool.

838
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,010
It's going to be all of
these podcasts there.

839
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,370
We should just take over it
and that's what I'm saying.

840
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,540
Am I settled down?

841
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,710
You should just take over.

842
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,330
How about you stop being a
lazy bitch and we make our own.

843
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,260
Yeah,

844
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,130
they get that better.

845
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:40,880
There you go.

846
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,710
Deaf squad podcast festival.

847
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,820
That's a good idea.

848
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,200
That way we don't have to think about,

849
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,730
you guys fucking stole the,

850
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,920
the Lollapalooza of podcasts.

851
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:49,290
You guys.

852
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:49,550
Oh,

853
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,750
I came in and nothing
overwhelming your asshole friends.

854
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,450
That's true.

855
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,090
Mean if we had too many people.

856
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,340
Yeah.

857
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,110
Well we have to get the tickets out quip
cause those death quad dickheads by him

858
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,580

859
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,740
Well show up and go.

860
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,070
We're still doing it since
September and if you want to do it,

861
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,670
I'd love to have you to do one to,

862
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,000
maybe we'll do a one of our
podcasts there and it depends on,

863
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:08,360
you know,

864
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,590
what my schedule looks like,

865
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:10,610
but it sounds like it'd be fun.

866
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,533
Yeah.

867
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,590

868
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,010
they have good studios
and you bring laptops?

869
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:15,691
Oh yeah.

870
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:15,900
It's,

871
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,730

I was so hot the other day
when we were doing a shotgun.

891
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:39,324
You remember her name?

892
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,210
I was like that check.

893
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:40,910
What's her name?

894
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,130
[inaudible] suck cause I like her.

895
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:42,701
She's very nice.

896
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:43,360
She's awesome.

897
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,751
She's very,

898
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:44,560
very nice person.

899
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,560
And she's got a podcast on the desk
squad podcast network as does our co,

900
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,050
our pal Kevin Pereira,

901
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,360
a great podcast.

902
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:53,194
Very funny guy.

903
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,230
Um,

904
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,230
the shows you got coming up are San
Francisco on Sunday and Friday and

905
00:23:59,271 --> 00:23:59,680
Saturdays.

906
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,420
Sacramento.

907
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,661
Yeah.

908
00:24:00,661 --> 00:24:00,871
Yeah,

909
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:02,520
it's a Friday and Saturday.

910
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:05,370
We have four shows at the
punchline in Sacramento.

911
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,331
It's me,

912
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:08,100
Sam Tripoli and Tony Hinchcliffe,

913
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,620
a fine show comedy show and comedy show.

914
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,371
And it's Sunday,

915
00:24:11,371 --> 00:24:12,390
Cinco de Mile.

916
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:12,960
Uh,

917
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,010
we're going to be in San
Francisco at the cops,

918
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,740
which is a pretty intimidating

919
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,360
get out of Sacramento for Cinco de Mayo.

920
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:20,180
An excellent movie.

921
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,013
Right.

922
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,043
Exactly.

923
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,530
Nothing wrong with some
happy drunk Mexicans,

924
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,530
white people that are scarier.

925
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,220
Yeah.

926
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,620
Oh,

927
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,760
you go to [inaudible] dot TV.

928
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,780
All the links for it tickets
or a Dick's party in my mouth.

929
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,481
Why you?

930
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:37,980
Why you worried about Sunday?

931
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:38,880
Why are you worried about Sunday?

932
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,590
Huh?

933
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,371
I'm not worried about Sunday.

934
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:41,204
He said it's intimidating.

935
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,400
The club is so huge there.

936
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,840
I remember going there with you and
that there was like double layers.

937
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:48,141
It's,

938
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:50,080
and it's just goes back forever.

939
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,170
That's so scary.

940
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,170
Scary.

941
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:53,300
No,

942
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,500
I mean to try to be like,

943
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,130
you know that it's a

944
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:56,751
filling.

945
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:57,561
It is is,

946
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:57,841
it's,

947
00:24:57,841 --> 00:24:58,910
it's tricky for sure.

948
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:03,911
But the other thing that's weird about
those big shows is comms used to be the

949
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:08,240
old cobb's was the most intimate club in
the country and it was the smallest cub

950
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,120
club that I worked because it was so cool.

951
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,200
Like it was only,

952
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,610
I think a hundred people,

953
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,370
like maybe at the most
they did like 150 people.

954
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,990
It was really small and I did it a few
times and you're just in there with them.

955
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,910
There's everyone's packed in together.

956
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,260
You see each other,

957
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:25,430
you could smell each other,

958
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,121
you know,

959
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,190
and it was just so,

960
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,380
so perfect.

961
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:29,990
A comedy club.

962
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,771
It wasn't a tiny,

963
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:31,371
tiny stage.

964
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:34,070
Like a lot of New York clubs is
a lot of small clubs in New York.

965
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,120
And uh,

966
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,840
one of the issues with New York
is space and some of the clubs,

967
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,760
the stage is so small,

968
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,000
you're literally standing closer
to the audience than I am to you.

969
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,301
Right?

970
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:44,631
Like you'll,

971
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:46,580
you'll be standing on
the table like literally,

972
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,160
and it's just too close to people.

973
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:50,120
Like you don't have any room to move.

974
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,590
And so you know,

975
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:51,830
is,

976
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,230
that's fine if you're
one of those up upright,

977
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,960
standard monologists it just stands
there and doesn't do anything.

978
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,240
But if you want to do
anything physical on stage,

979
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:00,920
there's literally no room to do it.

980
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,033
Right?

981
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:02,800
Yeah.

982
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,120
I,

983
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,630
I,

984
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,980
there was one like that in Pittsburgh
where it was like a sports bar where

985
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:11,940
you're basically sitting on this huge
stage in the middle of this room,

986
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:13,260
like a s like a square.

987
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,220
And it was just small enough where you
felt like you would accidentally fall off

988
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:18,054
at any time.

989
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,420
And then there was people all around you
kind of like in the round type thing.

990
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,220
It was so hard to focus on
doing comedy when you're like,

991
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:27,240
have a little buzz going,

992
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,200
trying to do comedy.

993
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,780
Like it was just
uncomfortable like situation.

994
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,980
Well Cobbs is a great club,

995
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:33,460
right?

996
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,220
Even even though the new ones huge,

997
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:35,821
it's still,

998
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:36,090
it's a,

999
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,080
it's a bad ass place.

1000
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:37,411
It's just,

1001
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:38,340
it's so different.

1002
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:38,701
I mean,

1003
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:40,200
I do pay places that are bigger.

1004
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,580
It's not that it's too big.

1005
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,300
Um,

1006
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,541
you know,

1007
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:43,380
like I just did a,

1008
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:45,640
the state theater in New Brunswick.

1009
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:45,890
Oh,

1010
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,150
was it?

1011
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:46,331
Oh,

1012
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:46,811
it's amazing.

1013
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:47,950
Anybody who came out to that show,

1014
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,761
thank you so much.

1015
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:52,900
That was like one of the best crowds
we've ever had ever at any show ever.

1016
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:53,800
Really is amazing.

1017
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,810
When Joey Diaz walked on stage,

1018
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,030
I was kicking myself for not recording it.

1019
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,140
It was,

1020
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,970
it was so epic,

1021
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,721
Dude.

1022
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:05,980
He went on stage and
people went fucking crazy.

1023
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,870
They went fucking crazy.

1024
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,220
The crowd was intense.

1025
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,180
It was so good.

1026
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,073
It was just so,

1027
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:11,911
it was perfect.

1028
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:13,630
It might've been the best
side I've ever had in my life.

1029
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,471
That's awesome.

1030
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:14,711
Really.

1031
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:14,880
It was.

1032
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,191
It was.

1033
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:15,630
It was.

1034
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,500
It was incredible.

1035
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,393
Incredible.

1036
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,263
Did you eat good?

1037
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,860
We ain't good at

1038
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,680
little bit of mud.

1039
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:25,661
Yeah.

1040
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:29,470
This guy brought a fucking
bag filled with bread,

1041
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:34,471
like five loafs of bread and a thing
of a [inaudible] mood set out cheese.

1042
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,600
This gigantic fucking slab of cheese.

1043
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:38,434
And I'm not bullshitting.

1044
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,170
Was like two loafs of bread.

1045
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,260
That's how much cheese it was.

1046
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,203
And it was,

1047
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,251
I didn't try.

1048
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:46,770
Joey had it show.

1049
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,613
He fucking,

1050
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,740
he took that thing like,

1051
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,220
like a,

1052
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,970
like a bear bearing a
Caribou in the woods.

1053
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,890
It's bread.

1054
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:54,640
And what's that al?

1055
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,370
And he took it up to his,

1056
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,650
uh,

1057
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,310
his room.

1058
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,170
He ate the shit out of that man.

1059
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,671
Yeah,

1060
00:27:59,671 --> 00:27:59,890
no,

1061
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,723
it was amazing.

1062
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,271
It does.

1063
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:01,690
Uh,

1064
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,523
thanks to Gino.

1065
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,363
Thanks Gino.

1066
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,990
New Jersey is awesome,

1067
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:05,590
man.

1068
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,950
At least that part was right.

1069
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,150
It's interesting.

1070
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,081
It's a,

1071
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:11,560
it's,

1072
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,071
it's weird.

1073
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:12,251
You know,

1074
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,180
because I was born there.

1075
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,823
It's a weird spot.

1076
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,420
Jersey's a strange spot.

1077
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,920
Well anyway,

1078
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,490
uh,

1079
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,480
but we're going to say in the state
theater is much bigger than than cops.

1080
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,530
It's like 2,400 people
or something like that.

1081
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,281
That's insane.

1082
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,114
It was awesome.

1083
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,430
It was fucking awesome.

1084
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:27,790
Is it just a different kind of show?

1085
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,403
You know,

1086
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,190
it's a,

1087
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,000
but the intimate shows like the ones
that we do at the ice house and like

1088
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:34,751
Sacramento,

1089
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:35,620
that's the perfect,

1090
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,910
I love Sacramento.

1091
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,510
Perfect Room.

1092
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,051
I want to try it.

1093
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,220
And what I'm trying to do is like,

1094
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:42,510
hopefully people come out to these shows
because I would like to do this at like

1095
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:42,580
a month,

1096
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,121
every month.

1097
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:43,990
Like on their off night.

1098
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,880
Just bringing a once a month,

1099
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:47,160
bring a couple of comics up there.

1100
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:47,240
Yeah.

1101
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,501
You know,

1102
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:48,280
and just good idea.

1103
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,113
That's a great club.

1104
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,010
It's a perfect size.

1105
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:52,450
It's the perfect height.

1106
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,703
It's just set up.

1107
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,011
It's,

1108
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:54,251
you know,

1109
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:55,240
it's just old school,

1110
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:55,721
old school,

1111
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:56,261
Tight Club,

1112
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:57,094
barn in the back.

1113
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,730
Sacramento has the most
beautiful women in the room.

1114
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,201
Oh,

1115
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:00,460
someone's trying to get some busy.

1116
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:01,300
I say what's up?

1117
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,731
So easy,

1118
00:29:03,731 --> 00:29:04,131
Brian.

1119
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:04,964
So easy.

1120
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,010
No,

1121
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,980
they are I Sacramento women are
fucking hot for some reason.

1122
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,430
I think it's like all the guys that
have money used to go up north,

1123
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:12,730
you know,

1124
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,930
we had money and then all their
kids got molested and they all went,

1125
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,180
I find northern California women
to be much more interesting.

1126
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,100
Yeah,

1127
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,580
yeah,

1128
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:21,940
yeah.

1129
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,090
I like to talk to them more.

1130
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,781
I just,

1131
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:24,350
I don't know why.

1132
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:24,531
I mean,

1133
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:24,651
that's,

1134
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:24,950
so,

1135
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,080
that's a massive generalization,

1136
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:27,914
by the way,

1137
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,400
you know?

1138
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,780
But it just just seemed like,

1139
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,790
I think here's the bottom line,

1140
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:32,031
dude,

1141
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:33,170
where we live is poisoned.

1142
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,130
It's horrible.

1143
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,850
It's poisoned,

1144
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,720
it's poisoned.

1145
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,640
It's poisoned with,

1146
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,020
with like behavior,

1147
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,520
like the actors and the,

1148
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:41,354
the business,

1149
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,510
the whole idea of the chasing fame.

1150
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,900
It's like a giant Methadone clinic for,

1151
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,470
for attention junkies.

1152
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,370
You know?

1153
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,630
That's what this area is.

1154
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,380
It really is.

1155
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:50,950
It is.

1156
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,670
It is.

1157
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,600
I mean you just can't,

1158
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,630
there's no other way you can explain the
grand percentage of self absorbed Nim

1159
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:01,690
wits that just does dumb people.

1160
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:02,021
This isn't it.

1161
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:03,010
There's no way to explain it.

1162
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,020
Yeah.

1163
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,840
And it really sucks hanging out
in certain parts more than others.

1164
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:07,740
Like especially Holly.

1165
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,430
We didn't even play the music yet,

1166
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,201
but you know what,

1167
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:12,710
we don't have to play any fucking music.

1168
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,070
Let's not play music that's not playing
music as classes are over a bitch.

1169
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,810
They've been over for a while.

1170
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,460
Okay.

1171
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,580
We don't need music.

1172
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,240
Yeah,

1173
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,073
sometimes we do,

1174
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,280
but sometimes fuck it.

1175
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,290
Let's get crazy this Brian,

1176
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:25,671
you know,

1177
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:26,001
this is a,

1178
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:28,010
an idea we had talked
about a couple of times.

1179
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:29,540
We haven't done one of
these in a long time.

1180
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:29,721
Just,

1181
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:30,200
you know what I mean?

1182
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,710
Yeah.

1183
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,041
I've been,

1184
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,180
and I would just randomly,

1185
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:33,740
there was a thread on
your message where I'd,

1186
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,610
oh wait,

1187
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,080
I should probably get it to the cameras.

1188
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,630
There was a thread on
the message board that,

1189
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,200
uh,

1190
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,850
that,

1191
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,580
um,

1192
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,091
people are like,

1193
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,460
have you ever started the
podcast from number one?

1194
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,571
And you were saying earlier,

1195
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:45,560
like whatever episode,

1196
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:46,880
this is like 300 something,

1197
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,970
three 51 times that by three hours.

1198
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,590
How many hours,

1199
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,140
hours it would take you?

1200
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:55,730
I think over a month I would,

1201
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,720
I'm guessing a month.

1202
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:57,081
In a week.

1203
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:57,830
I would say.

1204
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,540
Uh,

1205
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,750
to listen to it straight.

1206
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,080
Yeah.

1207
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,231
Well,

1208
00:31:01,231 --> 00:31:01,681
you know what?

1209
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:02,401
Podcasting,

1210
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:04,230
sort of a highlights,

1211
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,543
highlights,

1212
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,181
highlights,

1213
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:07,014
highlighted.

1214
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,740
So the word high lit for me
is how fucking crazy I am.

1215
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,370
Like I never really knew how crazy.

1216
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,070
It wasn't until we started doing these
podcasts and then a 351 podcast later I

1217
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:17,611
realized like,

1218
00:31:17,611 --> 00:31:17,761
wow,

1219
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:19,260
how did I even do that?

1220
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,980
Like where do I even have the time to
do these fucking things between this and

1221
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,520
Jiu Jitsu and comedy in
the UFC and family stuff.

1222
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,730
This is how the fuck
do you even have time?

1223
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:31,920
Like if I didn't,

1224
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,290
you know,

1225
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,660
if it wasn't me and I had to look at it,

1226
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:33,901
I'm like,

1227
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:34,681
Jesus Christ,

1228
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:35,514
what's wrong with that guy?

1229
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,600
Why is he doing so much shit?

1230
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,540
You are doing a lot of shit.

1231
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:41,841
Yeah,

1232
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:43,070
but it's all cool.

1233
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,970
Yeah.

1234
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,500
You know you're going
to burn yourself out,

1235
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:45,800
man.

1236
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,131
No,

1237
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:46,341
no,

1238
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:47,174
I'm fine.

1239
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,190
I feel burned out like crazy lately.

1240
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,320
Yeah.

1241
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,153
I mean

1242
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,360
continue with working out.

1243
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,770
As long as I eat good.

1244
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,110
Stay away from the sauce.

1245
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,700
Get off the booze kid.

1246
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,770
That's ruining your life.

1247
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,520
Yeah.

1248
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:00,911
Yeah.

1249
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:02,200
It's the sauce for sure.

1250
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,981
Because if I,

1251
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:04,980
if I have a couple go out to,

1252
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,260
you know,

1253
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,790
have a shot and a beer,

1254
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,430
even just a shot in the beer
the next day I'm like Ooh,

1255
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,270
not quite,

1256
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:10,511
you know,

1257
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,720
not like wrecked.

1258
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,560
It had been a wreck for sure
last time it was wrecked.

1259
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:17,920
It was Aubrey and I in
Brazil drink absinthe,

1260
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,523
you know.

1261
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,160
Oh Jesus Christ.

1262
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:21,670
Yeah,

1263
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,280
I did when we had our
shows up there that night.

1264
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,181
Well you know,

1265
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:28,420
we were there and just
buy some freak of nature.

1266
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:30,610
There was these guys from New
Hampshire that were there too.

1267
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,331
They weren't telling,

1268
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:31,571
you know,

1269
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:32,580
I think there probably were,

1270
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,070
were there to see the UFC as well and
we all just started doing an absence

1271
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:36,904
together.

1272
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,300
Yeah.

1273
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,120
Fuck that shit.

1274
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,953
Yeah,

1275
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,450
it gives you a weird hangover.

1276
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,140
I got sick cause I got,

1277
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,510
I was like hung over,

1278
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,700
got to the airport,

1279
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,551
felt like shit,

1280
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,780
went through all the lines and all that.

1281
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:55,781
So like my immune system was down at the
worst time when you're just swarmed by

1282
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:57,200
other people's funk.

1283
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,580
You know when you're at the airport,

1284
00:32:58,581 --> 00:32:58,821
man,

1285
00:32:58,821 --> 00:32:59,241
you're just,

1286
00:32:59,241 --> 00:32:59,481
you're,

1287
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:04,481
you're walking into like a fog of
people sneezes and farts and sweat.

1288
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:07,760
And especially when it was hot airports,

1289
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,310
you know when everybody's taking
a jacket off and you're like,

1290
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:10,881
Oh gee,

1291
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:15,050
this is a fucking crockpot of
stinky farts and feed and you know,

1292
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,930
it's all hermetically sealed.

1293
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:18,830
You know,

1294
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,460
the doors only open every now and again
to let people on a plane and a little

1295
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:24,830
air sneaks in there
from that little tunnel.

1296
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,050
But that's the only place
they're getting their air from.

1297
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:29,600
It's a gigantic closed
off to but no windows.

1298
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,950
It's the worst.

1299
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,251
Yeah,

1300
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:31,760
I mean that's,

1301
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,810
that's the airport.

1302
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,280
The airport sucks.

1303
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:39,020
Smelling other people's
farts on an airplane has to
be the worst things ever to

1304
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,410
show.

1305
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,660
Diaz cut a fart so bad.

1306
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:43,040
It made me write a blog about it.

1307
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,240
There's a blog is a blog,

1308
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,950
it's called,

1309
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,700
um,

1310
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,720
happy pills.

1311
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,550
It's somewhere on my website,

1312
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,510
but happy pills I wrote because a,

1313
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,910
I was,

1314
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,600
I was just,

1315
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,920
I was writing this thing,

1316
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,520
uh,

1317
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:58,880
just,

1318
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,560
I was just writing this thing about,

1319
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,290
uh,

1320
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,120
peoples,

1321
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,580
the commercials for those antidepressants.

1322
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,260
I don't even know if they're
allowed to do those anymore,

1323
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,460
but they would have commercials where
people all of a sudden like had these

1324
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:14,750
lives that were so wonderful and they
were running through fields of wheat and

1325
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,800
they were leaping through the air and
there was doing these things that made you

1326
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:19,940
feel like so happy.

1327
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,250
And while I'm in the middle of writing
this Chili Diaz has kind of Fart that

1328
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:27,890
could change the tides.

1329
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,940
Like the ocean water would
hit the wall of Fart.

1330
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,621
It would just go,

1331
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:34,131
no,

1332
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:34,611
no,

1333
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:35,150
no.

1334
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:39,270
The only person that I've ever smelled
far it's worse is Tate and Tate.

1335
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,620
Human taste,

1336
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,390
legendary.

1337
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:47,390
Many factions trying blood and just
nobody can go blow for blow with Tate.

1338
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:50,030
I've cut some hard before in my life,

1339
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:51,140
but I've just not worthy,

1340
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,570
I'm not worthy,

1341
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,800
you know.

1342
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,800
But Joey did one on a plane and
I'm telling you the fucking,

1343
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,120
the horror,

1344
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,850
the horror of this woman behind me,

1345
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,391
first of all,

1346
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:07,070
I almost threw up in my mouth.

1347
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,420
It was so bad.

1348
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,540
It was so fast.

1349
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,360
And Shelley fucking fan

1350
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,030
the worst he fails

1351
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,550
and he has no shame.

1352
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,880
Like he'll cut a horrible
fight and go soup guy.

1353
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,210
And then you just go,

1354
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,560
oh you motherfucker.

1355
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,090
Before the Fart hint,

1356
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,140
I swear to God,

1357
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:34,370
I felt warm

1358
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,320
before it hit my nose,

1359
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,030
but for the smell hit my nose.

1360
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,490
I felt like warm air.

1361
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,331
I was like,

1362
00:35:43,331 --> 00:35:44,260
what is that?

1363
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,140
And then it hit me that
it was a fart and it was,

1364
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,101
it was too late.

1365
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:50,650
I was already breathing in
trying to figure out what it was.

1366
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,573
Yeah.

1367
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,540
And it just filled my mouth with this gas,

1368
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,910
and this is a mouth because I
was mouth breathing back then.

1369
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,400
I'm like,

1370
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,233
oh,

1371
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,330
it was blue cheese,

1372
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:01,840
wasn't it?

1373
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,980
It was death,

1374
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,420
whatever it was.

1375
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,500
That's why he likes blue cheese.

1376
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,310
It's like I picture Joey
stomach as being like,

1377
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,293
you know,

1378
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,280
the amount of gas that it can generate.

1379
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,491
Like,

1380
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:14,500
if you want to have a
fart contest with Joey,

1381
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,850
you got to lose man.

1382
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,170
If he wants to eat when you eat,

1383
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,300
you've got to lose.

1384
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:19,781
You know,

1385
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:20,830
tape was always eating them.

1386
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:21,970
Fucking protein bars,

1387
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:22,530
man,

1388
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,580
you're but your body
doesn't digest those things.

1389
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,723
Yeah.

1390
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,040
If they don't and it just
automatically comes out.

1391
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:31,340
That was the worst mandates was the worst
though because every time you hung out

1392
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:32,060
with them,

1393
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,490
it wasn't like normal
hangout with somebody else.

1394
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,930
It was always about the farts.

1395
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:39,350
Like you'd get in the car with us and
we'd all have to roll down the windows

1396
00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:42,050
because it was just nonstop fart
in the whole way to the airport.

1397
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,130
And then we get on a plane,

1398
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:44,480
it was off farting on the plane.

1399
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:47,150
We get off and it's him coming into
your room and farting in your room.

1400
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,890
And he was a big park guy.

1401
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,551
Like he,

1402
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:53,600
I wonder if you ever got that
w like fixed her and whatever.

1403
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,131
Yeah,

1404
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:54,970
I don't know.

1405
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,073
I don't know.

1406
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,560
So I got turned on to Paris.

1407
00:36:57,561 --> 00:36:59,570
Hilton's a vines last night.

1408
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,140
And have you,

1409
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,801
have you seen?

1410
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,370
No,

1411
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,200
they are probably some of the most

1412
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,060
like,

1413
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,110
I don't know like one,

1414
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:07,880
I think she's pretty cute but uh,

1415
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,700
they all have the exact same shit in them.

1416
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,760
It's her like at a club and then at her
face and the exact same angle doing the

1417
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:17,960
same faith that it's almost trippy.

1418
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:22,100
Like almost like she doesn't exist
and they have somebody CGI her in like

1419
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:23,700
different scenes with a green screen.

1420
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:24,170
Like,

1421
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:24,940
like check this,

1422
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,200
let me,

1423
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,430
right,

1424
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,640
right.

1425
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,120
See First.

1426
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,050
So first there's what like one
just like you know like her,

1427
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,460
uh,

1428
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,293
hold on.

1429
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:38,200
So it's just her like doing like these
weird like kind of my space angles and

1430
00:37:38,201 --> 00:37:42,970
then it's hurt at a club doing
like a little at the same time.

1431
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,190
So she's showing like what she did like,

1432
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,151
like a taste of that.

1433
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:46,841
Could you see her face?

1434
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,520
She's doing her at her side or angle.

1435
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,940
And then you go to this other one that
looks like the same club but it's not,

1436
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,720
it's from a too,

1437
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,130
but she's trying turned
like the same shit.

1438
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,120
And then here's another one.

1439
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:57,420
Like,

1440
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,910
it's just weird thing she is,

1441
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:01,744
man.

1442
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,410
She's such an odd,

1443
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:03,981
odd,

1444
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:04,910
famous person.

1445
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,800
She's so famous.

1446
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,281
I mean,

1447
00:38:07,281 --> 00:38:08,330
what does she's hated or not?

1448
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:09,080
First of all,

1449
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,913
I like her a lot.

1450
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,520
I do not think she should
be hated by for any reason.

1451
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,440
She doesn't do anything wrong.

1452
00:38:15,441 --> 00:38:16,490
She's not hurting anybody.

1453
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,010
And that's how I felt when
people like shitting all over.

1454
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,350
Yeah.

1455
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:19,510
I don't know.

1456
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,240
It's like,

1457
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,660
you know,

1458
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:20,991
yeah,

1459
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:21,860
she's Vapid.

1460
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:22,850
You know,

1461
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,230
she's doing this.

1462
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,660
Go into clubs and going out
and dancing and smiling.

1463
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:27,570
But who's that hurt?

1464
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,090
Who does that hurt?

1465
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,043
You know,

1466
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,913
the only,

1467
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,641
the only argument,

1468
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:34,250
and I could hear that I've heard
that it kind of makes sense,

1469
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:37,320
is that she lowers standards for young
girls and she gets them thinking.

1470
00:38:37,321 --> 00:38:38,154
But you know what,

1471
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,243
that's,

1472
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,870
that's just a part of life.

1473
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,820
People get bad influences sometimes.

1474
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,780
You know,

1475
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,950
I think if you,

1476
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:45,784
uh,

1477
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
if you have young kids and you communicate
with them good values and you try to

1478
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:56,080
do the best to raise them
into responsible human beings,

1479
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,670
everything after that is on them.

1480
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:58,511
You know,

1481
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,850
if your kid likes going to clubs
or kid likes going to clubs.

1482
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,331
Okay.

1483
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:03,580
And if your kid wants to be Paris Hilton,

1484
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,290
this is like we're shit in life.

1485
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:05,541
Right.

1486
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:06,374
You know,

1487
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,810
she's actually really intelligent.

1488
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,030
What do you play crosswords with her?

1489
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,430
No,

1490
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,760
I intelligent of how she became famous.

1491
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:13,091
You know,

1492
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:13,361
like,

1493
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:14,110
like what she,

1494
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,940
how's she made a name of herself,

1495
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:16,121
you know,

1496
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,830
of course she made a sex tape.

1497
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,030
Well that's been done twice now,

1498
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:22,391
you know,

1499
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:23,350
two girls got famous.

1500
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:23,850
Right.

1501
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,210
I mean that's what production was.

1502
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:26,200
Cordelia was her buddy,

1503
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:26,890
you know,

1504
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,090
making us sex tape.

1505
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:31,150
Little girls might not be a bad thing if
you want to be rich millionaire for the

1506
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:31,760
rest of your,

1507
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,580
I think the time for that as well though.

1508
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,440
I think it's not shocking anymore.

1509
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:35,891
Yeah.

1510
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:36,970
That was a long time ago,

1511
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:37,890
you know?

1512
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,750
But what's interesting
about Kim Kardashian,

1513
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,760
I said she like literally
there was no introduction.

1514
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,570
No one knew who she was
before that sex tape.

1515
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,600
But then she does that sex tape and like
she's one of the most famous women on

1516
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:52,774
the planet.

1517
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,590
And it because you don't release it
because like it snuck out somehow or

1518
00:39:58,751 --> 00:39:59,560
another.

1519
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,393
It's okay.

1520
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:00,820
Like,

1521
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,041
yeah,

1522
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:05,750
like we got reared rules when it comes
to sex tapes and the rules and the laws

1523
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,510
are a lot different than
a lot of people think.

1524
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,370
Like I heard a recent conversation with
Ari who's gonna be on tomorrow where he

1525
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,520
doesn't believe that people
can't just release a sex date.

1526
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:21,400
Like if you have a tape of Paris
Hilton and that guy fucking he,

1527
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:22,850
that he thinks he could
just put on the Internet,

1528
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,713
no one matters,

1529
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,070
which is not the case.

1530
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:30,071
A lot of all these sex tapes actually
have to be signed off by one of the people

1531
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:32,150
in the Thi you know,

1532
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,350
both of the people actually both of them.

1533
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:34,790
Well,

1534
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,510
I mean if you,

1535
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,970
if you look at it like
does it vary by state?

1536
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,200
It might be,

1537
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,370
but if you look at porn,

1538
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,140
they all have to have like the,

1539
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,063
like the,

1540
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,540
the right paperwork saying like,

1541
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,051
this is like,

1542
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:45,351
you know,

1543
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:47,990
this person's over 18 years
old and stuff like that.

1544
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,350
Right.

1545
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,550
And so they can't,

1546
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:49,911
you know,

1547
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:52,700
you can't really just release and
sell a porn video without that.

1548
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,320
So you kind of have to
have the person assigned.

1549
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:55,821
Same like,

1550
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:56,241
you know,

1551
00:40:56,241 --> 00:40:56,691
like yes,

1552
00:40:56,691 --> 00:40:57,111
that's me.

1553
00:40:57,111 --> 00:40:57,321
Yes,

1554
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,700
I'm 18 and stuff like,

1555
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,250
you know,

1556
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,180
you can't just release
like a video and sell it.

1557
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,230
If porn you have,

1558
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,750
you have to follow the same paperwork.

1559
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:08,180
You'd have to ask a real porn producer.

1560
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:08,660
Well,

1561
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,630
Kevin Blatt who's a friends with Sam
Tripoli and that's what he does for a

1562
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:12,080
living.

1563
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,351
You know,

1564
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:13,010
he's,

1565
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:16,040
I think he actually did the
Paris Hilton tape and yeah,

1566
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,080
they people shop tapes to them and it's
99.9 always the person that's yeah.

1567
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,040
Accidentally fell in this and it's me,

1568
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,983
right,

1569
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,250
with three camera angles.

1570
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,150
Yeah.

1571
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,600
I was reading Twitter the
other day last night actually.

1572
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,663
And um,

1573
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,060
I

1574
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,510
have,

1575
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,710
I fall so many people.

1576
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,030
I follow a lot of weird people.

1577
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,620
Don't ask me to follow you.

1578
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,671
He asked me to follow you.

1579
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:40,330
I won't follow you.

1580
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,163
That's my roles.

1581
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,200
Although I've said yes a couple of times.

1582
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:43,660
Don't do it.

1583
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,260
Don't ask.

1584
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,093
It's gross.

1585
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,993
Um,

1586
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,890
uh,

1587
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,590
I was looking reading through my
Twitter and it says anal loving ladies

1588
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,360
lead need last minute
replacement for a scene tomorrow.

1589
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,950
Get at me here.

1590
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,280
Our tea please is from Seymour Butts and
I'm like looking down and like one of

1591
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,950
my tweets is like a deep rock show,

1592
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,540
Oprah tweet and the other one's like a
couple of MMA fighters and then sandwich

1593
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:15,570
in between that and it's all in caps
with like little stars next to anal star,

1594
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:16,210
Star Star,

1595
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,270
anal loving lady,

1596
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:18,881
Star Star,

1597
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:19,121
Star,

1598
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:19,540
Star Star.

1599
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,110
All caps need last minute
replacement for a scene tomorrow.

1600
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,090
That's how many times has that happened
where a girl just calls you up the day

1601
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:26,351
before and he goes,

1602
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:27,184
you know what,

1603
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:32,190
you can't fuck me in the ass on camera
and put it on the Internet and this guy's

1604
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:32,681
just like,

1605
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:33,211
God damn.

1606
00:42:33,211 --> 00:42:33,941
And I had one,

1607
00:42:33,941 --> 00:42:35,680
I need that anal loving lady.

1608
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,880
But do you think,

1609
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,480
I guess he,

1610
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,990
I bet bet he puts out that thing and
like immediately it's people like

1611
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:41,830
contacting him.

1612
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,490
Oh yeah,

1613
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,323
absolutely.

1614
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:43,691
I love it.

1615
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:44,524
You know,

1616
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,423
OMG

1617
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,430
pretty cheap too.

1618
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:47,780
If you need to make a,

1619
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,310
if he really wanted to get laid,

1620
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:51,920
you could really just make
yourself a porn company.

1621
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,020
I've done that.

1622
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,410
Yeah.

1623
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:53,660
Yeah.

1624
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,351
Guys have done that.

1625
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:55,184
Guys have done,

1626
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,421
I,

1627
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:56,450
I met a guy who did that.

1628
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,310
K a website where he would uh,

1629
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:00,580
I forget what his website was called.

1630
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,640
[inaudible] who would
like have sex with girls.

1631
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,350
It would pay them,

1632
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,980
have sex with him and he
was like membership only.

1633
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,140
But this was like a long ass time ago.

1634
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:08,820
Like I don't know if you could
get away with that today.

1635
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:09,960
People don't want to buy anything.

1636
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:10,901
No,

1637
00:43:10,901 --> 00:43:11,051
no.

1638
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:12,310
I'm going to say you don't even sell it.

1639
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,800
What I'm saying you could do it.

1640
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:18,790
So it would basically
just be getting you laid.

1641
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,653
That's what I'm saying.

1642
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,100
Cause I know the rates for
different girls for working,

1643
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:24,870
you know,

1644
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,650
if they said that they would do it,

1645
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:27,484
you know,

1646
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:28,963
cheap

1647
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,810
released the video.

1648
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:32,660
Isn't it funny?

1649
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,570
That's like a work
around for prostitution.

1650
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,290
Yeah.

1651
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,740
I mean essentially it's
a work around right?

1652
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,110
Not that I'm against it.

1653
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:38,950
I'm,

1654
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,640
again,

1655
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,960
I'm not against anything.

1656
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:41,830
If you want to do it,

1657
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,080
if it doesn't hurt anybody
else and you want to do it,

1658
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,070
I'm not against anything.

1659
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,353
I don't really care.

1660
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,590
I think that this world is so weird and
there's so many things that people liked

1661
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:50,681
it.

1662
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:53,350
I don't understand so many things that
I liked that people don't understand.

1663
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,600
Who am I to tell a chicken
not to be a hooker?

1664
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,500
Right?

1665
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:56,861
You know,

1666
00:43:56,861 --> 00:43:59,920
and who might've tell a
guy not to pay for sex,

1667
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,510
how many guys had just been just fucked
over their whole life and it's just like

1668
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,760
almost too late for them
to have a relationship.

1669
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:10,960
You can tell me that guy shouldn't be
able to get a massage and get jerked off

1670
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,090
for 50 bucks or 100 bucks,

1671
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:13,924
40 bucks,

1672
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,430
$40 what happened to the house?

1673
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,293
That's what you hear.

1674
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,523
That's what you hear.

1675
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,980
It's allegedly allegedly at least
chain one to be very clear about that.

1676
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:21,903
I heard,

1677
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,000
but like if you think about it,

1678
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,950
you know why?

1679
00:44:25,951 --> 00:44:29,230
Why shouldn't there be an option for that
guy where he can just pay for someone

1680
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:30,730
to rub him?

1681
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,301
Cause look,

1682
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,910
I go get massages and massages are,

1683
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:38,320
especially if you get it from someone
who's really good at it and it's like very

1684
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:39,190
pleasurable,

1685
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:39,641
you know?

1686
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:40,870
And sometimes it's like a guy,

1687
00:44:40,871 --> 00:44:41,411
he's doing it.

1688
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:42,580
It's like horrific.

1689
00:44:42,581 --> 00:44:43,120
No,

1690
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,840
I never got,

1691
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,470
never had a guy I would not feeling
that great pleasure from a man.

1692
00:44:47,471 --> 00:44:49,420
This is weird bonding thing going on.

1693
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,430
Do you want to size naked?

1694
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,530
Almost always with the guy.

1695
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,070
Keep my underwear on Sun.

1696
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:57,761
Oh No,

1697
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:58,720
I always do naked.

1698
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,111
I just,

1699
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:01,120
in case I have to valley
to do my way out of there.

1700
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:02,560
I got some little valley to those shorts.

1701
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,440
I like Mario Sperry in the nineties

1702
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:10,710
I was driving by a palm reader last night
and I've been noticing more and more,

1703
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:12,880
I've been just looking
at palm readers cause I,

1704
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:16,060
there's a lot of psychics here in la and
I remember it in Ohio here and there.

1705
00:45:16,061 --> 00:45:17,470
But the one thing I noticed,

1706
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,780
they're always open my 24 hours a day.

1707
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:22,420
It would be like two in the
morning and you have lights on.

1708
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,950
It looks like they live there.

1709
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:28,930
Also there's an open sign
and I'm wondering if psychics
are something that you

1710
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:29,890
learn when you're older.

1711
00:45:29,891 --> 00:45:31,480
Like when you're like 70
or 80 and you're like,

1712
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,781
oh no,

1713
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:33,780
you go to a psychic to fuck.

1714
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:34,331
You know,

1715
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,164
like,

1716
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:35,980
like,

1717
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,170
like I think there's something
going on because he was,

1718
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,810
there's a lot of people,

1719
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:40,531
you'd be really,

1720
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:41,341
really surprised.

1721
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:43,650
There's a lot of people
who believe in psychics.

1722
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,353
Them why is,

1723
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,420
see that's the thing and there's
things I don't understand.

1724
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:48,680
Like I don't understand that.

1725
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,790
I don't understand why doughnut drive
through places are so popular at foreign.

1726
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,000
Like they're all doughnut places
are open on times at night.

1727
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:56,181
You know,

1728
00:45:56,181 --> 00:45:57,014
that's this

1729
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,240
Krispy Kreme and they open 24 hours a day.

1730
00:45:59,300 --> 00:45:59,661
I don't know.

1731
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:00,830
But that's the only one that matters.

1732
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,270
Krispy Kreme had a line,

1733
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,480
I think they are like 40 people
deep last night in Burbank.

1734
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,100
It,

1735
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:06,820
they're doing it right.

1736
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,140
What,

1737
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,160
how's that possible?

1738
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:10,160
It's just don't fucking delicious.

1739
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,350
Especially because some of those freaks
who are real crazy Krispy Kreme people,

1740
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,820
they know when the warm
ones come out of like,

1741
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,273
I bet they have an APP.

1742
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,941
If they don't have an APP,

1743
00:46:19,941 --> 00:46:20,774
they should have an APP.

1744
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,621
The alerts,

1745
00:46:21,621 --> 00:46:24,890
you warm donuts within five
minutes because if you get them,

1746
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:26,601
I don't want to tell you,

1747
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:26,811
look,

1748
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:27,770
if you're on a diet right now,

1749
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,960
all I've eaten all day to
day folks as a Kale shake,

1750
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,590
okay?

1751
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,470
Be Clear about this.

1752
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:32,210
For the most part,

1753
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,680
I eat healthy and you should too.

1754
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:38,540
But if you want a real next level
experience when it comes to eat and sweet

1755
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:38,781
shit,

1756
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:39,614
that's bad for you,

1757
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,090
those Krispy Kreme donuts,

1758
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:42,510
it come right out of the almond.

1759
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,060
You could be there when it happens.

1760
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,020
That's what it must have been.

1761
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:45,681
God Damn,

1762
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:45,951
dude,

1763
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:46,431
I'm telling you,

1764
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:47,840
they melt in your mouth.

1765
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:49,040
You sink your teeth into them.

1766
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:51,320
They have the perfect consistency.

1767
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,090
It's not too firm.

1768
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,440
It's not like a Brownie,

1769
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:54,651
right?

1770
00:46:54,651 --> 00:46:55,250
You know?

1771
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,250
But it's not like it's a,

1772
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,530
it's a strange thing,

1773
00:46:57,531 --> 00:46:57,771
man.

1774
00:46:57,771 --> 00:47:01,940
And you take bites this thing and the
sugar level is out of this fucking world.

1775
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:02,720
Okay.

1776
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,310
It's covered in sugar.

1777
00:47:04,311 --> 00:47:06,020
The whole thing is glazed.

1778
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,330
The outside glazes,

1779
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,270
all sugar.

1780
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:08,781
It's sugar.

1781
00:47:08,781 --> 00:47:10,120
And what old Carmel?

1782
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,000
It's,

1783
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,820
it hits you who just
turned the thing though.

1784
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,040
That what happened?

1785
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:16,933
That was weird.

1786
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:18,260
Yeah.

1787
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,093
What was that man?

1788
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,143
My shuts off.

1789
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,110
That was weird.

1790
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:21,943
Anyway,

1791
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,350
it couldn't taste any better.

1792
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,060
It literally couldn't taste any better.

1793
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,310
Jimmy was when you started
touching that iPad.

1794
00:47:29,311 --> 00:47:30,091
But that's not possible.

1795
00:47:30,091 --> 00:47:31,040
That's not hooked up to anything.

1796
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:31,260
Right.

1797
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,093
It must have been this,

1798
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:33,323
I don't know.

1799
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:33,691
Well,

1800
00:47:33,691 --> 00:47:34,500
whatever it was.

1801
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,030
Um,

1802
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,640
and that's probably what it was
because it was out of this road.

1803
00:47:37,641 --> 00:47:38,030
I was like,

1804
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:41,930
there was a line out into the
street and into this busy street.

1805
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,280
I don't want to encourage you to
have a new addiction on my guide,

1806
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,570
but if you can go there,

1807
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,280
go you,

1808
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,700
we should go there and
you should go there,

1809
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,720
sit inside this little laptop and
just do a little work and then say,

1810
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:52,191
you just let me know.

1811
00:47:52,191 --> 00:47:54,360
And then warm months Kevin out
and those woman's come out.

1812
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:55,380
You run after him.

1813
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,120
It's funny because I
had to fight for them.

1814
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,270
I want you to make a fine about it
because there was like six cop cars.

1815
00:48:00,271 --> 00:48:01,970
I like the [inaudible] six.

1816
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,251
I'm like,

1817
00:48:02,251 --> 00:48:03,420
this is so hilarious.

1818
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:04,561
Well,

1819
00:48:04,561 --> 00:48:05,071
you know what,

1820
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:05,851
if I was a cop,

1821
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:07,490
I'm out there freaking out all day word.

1822
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:08,310
I'm going to get shot.

1823
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,450
How am I going to come home to my kids?

1824
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,400
I would enjoy a little sweet tooth too.

1825
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,810
I would enjoy a little donut.

1826
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,260
There's a reason why cops like donuts
because they have to reward themselves for

1827
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,030
swimming around a world of Shit.

1828
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,030
I got a new addiction,

1829
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,350
Maddie gotta check this out.

1830
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,770
There's a lot of different kinds of
apps that you can get out of your phone,

1831
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:24,820
but one of the best ones,

1832
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:26,680
especially since like this Boston Shit,

1833
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:27,161
uh,

1834
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:27,760
was uh,

1835
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,970
looking at police scanners and I don't
know if you like dig into that or not,

1836
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:34,750
but last night I was driving home and
there was so many cops in Burbank,

1837
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:35,330
but there was,

1838
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,850
there's usually like two cops in Burbank.

1839
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,391
There was like,

1840
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:37,691
cops,

1841
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:39,100
like driving all over the place.

1842
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:39,341
I was like,

1843
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:40,840
something's going on right.

1844
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,260
And so I turned on the police scanner
and my car while I'm driving and it's so

1845
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:44,710
funny,

1846
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,840
they were talking about me and I was like,

1847
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:47,703
uh,

1848
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:50,830
we had a black Volkswagen beetle
license plate and I'm like,

1849
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,060
what the fuck are they sang?

1850
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,070
And I guess they were looking for a car
and the cop just like kind of pulled up,

1851
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:59,260
started driving next to me while I was
listening to the police scanner over my

1852
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:00,094
speakers.

1853
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,160
But they didn't do an end
up doing anything like that.

1854
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:07,690
I don't even know what
they were talking about.

1855
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,890
So I get home and it was so interesting
listening to that for two hours because

1856
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:13,900
they were talking about
streets in my neighborhood.

1857
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:15,330
Like this woman's like we have a break in,

1858
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,050
she's hiding in the bathroom,

1859
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:18,400
there's so many inside the house.

1860
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:19,000
And they're like,

1861
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,710
this is our seventh
time doing it this week.

1862
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:21,970
She's an elderly woman.

1863
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,470
There's probably not
going to be anyone there.

1864
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:23,721
You know?

1865
00:49:23,721 --> 00:49:26,380
It's like they were just
like talking about it.

1866
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,240
But it's so interesting to listen to that.

1867
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:28,901
And especially,

1868
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:31,180
it's interesting to listen
to it while you're driving.

1869
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:31,690
You know,

1870
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:32,530
late at night,

1871
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,230
cause they will talk about
you on the police scanner.

1872
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:36,783
It's so crazy.

1873
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,710
And Freddy Loc actually uses it.

1874
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,633
He says this,

1875
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,623
this is pretty funny.

1876
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,900
When he isn't like in a bad
neighborhood or something like that,

1877
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,220
he'll turn on the police skater like
turn on really loud like speakerphone

1878
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:47,770
style,

1879
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,760
put it in his pocket.

1880
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,520
So it kind of sounds like he has
like a police presence on them,

1881
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:51,851
you know,

1882
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:52,021
like,

1883
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:52,910
so if people were like,

1884
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,100
like who the fuck's this guy?

1885
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,720
So yeah,

1886
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,051
please.

1887
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:56,380
Scanner.

1888
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,940
It's a free out in his pocket.

1889
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,570
People think he's got a radio.

1890
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,753
Exactly.

1891
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:01,760
Oh Mike.

1892
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,150
Like that's a good idea for girls ladies.

1893
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:04,661
Like if they,

1894
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:05,290
uh,

1895
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:05,741
if they,

1896
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:06,100
uh,

1897
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,360
if they're in a bad neighborhood,

1898
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:07,860
throw that in your

1899
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,611
progressive dude.

1900
00:50:08,611 --> 00:50:11,700
You're really turned on by cops
or hates cops are really bad.

1901
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,583
Oh,

1902
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:14,710
yikes.

1903
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,550
I uh,

1904
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:16,550
illegal.

1905
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:16,800
Huh?

1906
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,270
The scanner thing has to be,

1907
00:50:18,271 --> 00:50:19,104
it's on the IPAD.

1908
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,370
How did it use to Oh yeah.

1909
00:50:20,371 --> 00:50:20,870
Right.

1910
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:21,150
Yeah.

1911
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:21,391
Right.

1912
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:22,290
It's a real legit,

1913
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:22,501
yeah,

1914
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:23,340
there's tons of apps.

1915
00:50:23,341 --> 00:50:24,091
You have to approve those.

1916
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:24,450
Right.

1917
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,790
I think that's good that
apple approves apps.

1918
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,410
I think it's bad because there's a lot
of shit I'm sure that gets censored,

1919
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,460
you know,

1920
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,950
like some fucking crazy ass hole once I
have like beheadings only as an app or

1921
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,231
you know,

1922
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:37,910
all the beheadings for the past year.

1923
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,350
Cause there's always a bunch
of them on the Internet.

1924
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,390
But you know,

1925
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:41,871
Apple's like,

1926
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:42,111
no,

1927
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:42,411
he's sick.

1928
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:43,730
Fuck you got to get done in your own.

1929
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:48,000
There's a website right now and
that's devoted to Google apps.

1930
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,950
I think it's created by,

1931
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,620
I want to say bang.

1932
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,990
[inaudible] we never talked
about Google glasses.

1933
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:55,681
Oh yeah,

1934
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:56,040
yeah,

1935
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,400
that's,

1936
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,233
that's true.

1937
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:57,690
Yeah.

1938
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,370
My friend let me try out,

1939
00:50:59,400 --> 00:50:59,790
uh,

1940
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,090
her Google glasses and uh,

1941
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:02,521
it was,

1942
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:03,150
uh,

1943
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,320
first of all it's,

1944
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:04,740
it,

1945
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,940
it was really weird because to be able
to try something out that no one has yet.

1946
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:09,330
Right.

1947
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:09,870
You know,

1948
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,400
I think developers have them now.

1949
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:11,940
Right.

1950
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,510
Um,

1951
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,560
and I'm going to get one,

1952
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,550
but um,

1953
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:15,691
this was,

1954
00:51:15,691 --> 00:51:16,770
this was a long time ago.

1955
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:17,550
The first time I,

1956
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,450
I saw them,

1957
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:19,050
the law,

1958
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,520
the first time I saw him
was over six months ago,

1959
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,100
but the first time I tried him out,

1960
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:23,461
excuse me,

1961
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:24,220
sorry about that folks.

1962
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:24,450
Jamie,

1963
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,283
kind of cold and warm.

1964
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:26,280
Um,

1965
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,150
the first time I,

1966
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:27,780
uh,

1967
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,351
actually,

1968
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:28,680
uh,

1969
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,440
tried it out was this past
week and it was really,

1970
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:32,274
they're really weird.

1971
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:32,551
All right,

1972
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:34,590
so they're like clear
glasses that cover up.

1973
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:34,960
You're like,

1974
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,171
no,

1975
00:51:35,171 --> 00:51:35,241
no,

1976
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:35,380
no,

1977
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,213
no,

1978
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:36,451
no.

1979
00:51:36,451 --> 00:51:37,290
It's just a frame.

1980
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,020
It's a frame in,

1981
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:40,520
in the right corner.

1982
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,650
I don't know if it's a reversible this,

1983
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:44,810
you could see that as
a picture of it on my,

1984
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:45,644
uh,

1985
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:47,781
my,

1986
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:48,440
uh,

1987
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,273
what is it?

1988
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:50,203
Instagram.

1989
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:51,883
Instagram.

1990
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,230
I saw Louis Black this weekend and one
of the things he was talking about with

1991
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,083
Instagram,

1992
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,260
like how crazy is that?

1993
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:02,120
They got $1 billion for Instagram.

1994
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,300
It was pretty funny for
what Instagram does,

1995
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,030
but I don't even know why is it,

1996
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,090
you know,

1997
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,740
I just started using
it because people say,

1998
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:10,851
Hey,

1999
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:11,780
do you have an Instagram?

2000
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:12,381
I'm like,

2001
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:13,190
I guess,

2002
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,431
okay,

2003
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,120
I'll get one.

2004
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,490
And then Everlast made
us to start using it.

2005
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:17,311
Yeah.

2006
00:52:17,311 --> 00:52:22,050
I started a not using it as
much lately anymore because of,

2007
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:23,123
uh,

2008
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:23,970
the other one.

2009
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,890
How many characters do
you get on Instagram?

2010
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:27,780
As much as you want anything.

2011
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:28,800
So you can,

2012
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,150
it's like a tweet or at least,

2013
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:30,760
and then

2014
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,140
click on it and they go to it.

2015
00:52:32,141 --> 00:52:34,330
And it's almost like a
twit longer with a picture.

2016
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,430
Yeah.

2017
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:36,263
Yeah.

2018
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,960
Twit longer is annoying.

2019
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,670
I remember that Shit.

2020
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:40,811
Does people do,

2021
00:52:40,811 --> 00:52:41,830
people who still use that,

2022
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,150
people still use that.

2023
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,470
You're really missing the point.

2024
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,380
So for real cause or reason,

2025
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:47,620
yeah.

2026
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,860
There's a reason why they're trying to
limit you to 140 characters because most

2027
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:52,060
people are boring.

2028
00:52:52,061 --> 00:52:56,980
Verbose motherfuckers who just never
know when to stop and these crazy tweet

2029
00:52:56,981 --> 00:52:58,750
longer twit long or fuckers.

2030
00:52:58,850 --> 00:52:59,121
All right.

2031
00:52:59,121 --> 00:52:59,690
So,

2032
00:52:59,690 --> 00:52:59,930
okay,

2033
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:00,980
so you see that my ride,

2034
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:02,180
I see that thing,

2035
00:53:02,181 --> 00:53:03,350
that little piece of glass?

2036
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:03,710
No,

2037
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:03,771
no,

2038
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:03,891
no.

2039
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:04,730
There's no glass there.

2040
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,020
That's just my face.

2041
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:06,321
Yeah,

2042
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:08,150
that's whole thing is exactly.

2043
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,283
Exactly.

2044
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,420
So it's not a pair of glasses,

2045
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:12,150
it sits on you.

2046
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:12,240
No,

2047
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,110
it's like classes,

2048
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:15,210
but there's nothing over one eye.

2049
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:18,580
I don't know if they can make a design
that doesn't have like this because this

2050
00:53:18,581 --> 00:53:20,440
just looks like the from the jerk,

2051
00:53:20,441 --> 00:53:20,681
you know,

2052
00:53:20,681 --> 00:53:25,410
like the glasses from the movie that
kind of almost looks weird little thing

2053
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,040
that you think you

2054
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,570
see that you've got your cursor over.

2055
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,140
Yeah.

2056
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,440
That is the little little
window that you see everything.

2057
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,640
And so you swipe it.

2058
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:36,820
The way it works is by swiping
forward and swiping down and uh,

2059
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,480
you talk to it and it
does everything on voice.

2060
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,710
Say Weicker hand in front of you.

2061
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,480
Like I did Google searches and it,

2062
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:44,790
it worked like it was,

2063
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:45,624
it was amazing.

2064
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:46,290
Like I,

2065
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,010
I,

2066
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:47,701
like I said,

2067
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:48,534
I think you say like,

2068
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,160
okay glass or something like that.

2069
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:50,550
Right.

2070
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,280
And then I a God damn,

2071
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:54,031
I got to stop doing that.

2072
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:54,864
I'm so sorry folks.

2073
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,010
That'll be the last one,

2074
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:56,843
I promise.

2075
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,460
Uh,

2076
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,590
it's a bulletproof coffee.

2077
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,700
It coats your throat.

2078
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:01,870
I never drink bulletproof
coffee before I go onstage,

2079
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:02,750
but I drank it before I do it

2080
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,220
podcast.

2081
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:03,911
Is that what it is?

2082
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:05,380
Cause you've been thinking a lot lately.

2083
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:06,400
It coat your throat.

2084
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:07,241
Isn't that good?

2085
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:09,220
Isn't that make it not Cough
Cause It's all oiled up.

2086
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:09,760
No,

2087
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,061
it's,

2088
00:54:10,061 --> 00:54:13,480
there's a lot of like you're this grass
fed butter in there and it gives you

2089
00:54:13,481 --> 00:54:15,070
this like residue sort of thing.

2090
00:54:15,071 --> 00:54:17,060
And when you start talking
it makes me want it.

2091
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:18,520
Right.

2092
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,380
So probably probably a bad idea.

2093
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,290
How's your cholesterol and stuff?

2094
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,130
It's all groovy.

2095
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:24,720
Okay.

2096
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,290
Cause that butter is not
going to fuck anything up.

2097
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:26,900
No,

2098
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,081
no,

2099
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:27,231
no,

2100
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:27,390
no,

2101
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:27,570
no.

2102
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:27,840
It's,

2103
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,210
you know,

2104
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,680
cholesterol comes from animal protein.

2105
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,150
Oh,

2106
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,940
okay.

2107
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,290
What's butter than like butter does.

2108
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:33,490
Some butter comes from animals.

2109
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,140
Butter has a cholesterol,

2110
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,250
but almond butter,

2111
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,060
it's not butter.

2112
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:37,760
Right?

2113
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,060
Uh,

2114
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,470
it's like,

2115
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,620
uh,

2116
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,700
it's like almond paste.

2117
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:40,670
You know what I'm thinking?

2118
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:41,503
Has any butter in it,

2119
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,640
but almonds are a lot of fat in it.

2120
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,790
I should actually find out
what's an almond butter.

2121
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,331
Oh,

2122
00:54:46,331 --> 00:54:48,190
but the fact that it's in is good.

2123
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:48,911
That's all good.

2124
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,340
Fat Almond butter ingredients.

2125
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:53,730
And you're like,

2126
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:55,260
hmm.

2127
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,051
Well it's actually,

2128
00:54:56,051 --> 00:54:57,360
there was a video that
I watched it the day.

2129
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,091
It was kind of interesting,

2130
00:54:58,091 --> 00:55:02,110
but this one guy who eats nothing but raw
food and fats and he was like an older

2131
00:55:02,111 --> 00:55:07,111
guy and he eats raw meat and he was having
brought buffalo and raw hamburger and

2132
00:55:07,631 --> 00:55:08,200
he was uh,

2133
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,250
he was just eating it and eating it
with chunks of raw butter in between.

2134
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,450
Yeah.

2135
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:15,070
What

2136
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,540
now these are the Google glasses.

2137
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:18,040
Did they record everything?

2138
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:18,361
The whole thing.

2139
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:19,210
Because there is a camp.

2140
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,200
Looks like a Camry.

2141
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,770
Take pictures.

2142
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,910
I did that too.

2143
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,170
I took pictures with it.

2144
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:27,900
It's weird dude.

2145
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:28,853
It's weird.

2146
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,550
It will pull up this constantly.

2147
00:55:30,551 --> 00:55:34,660
Always recorded and everybody warm
because then that would be interesting.

2148
00:55:34,661 --> 00:55:37,370
Like during times of tragedy
everyone would have that.

2149
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,450
It's like 500 people would have
their view of what happened,

2150
00:55:40,451 --> 00:55:40,980
you know what I mean?

2151
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,950
It's a very interesting

2152
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:47,020
thing to have them on and see like a
navigation screen in front of you of how I

2153
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:47,854
did that as well.

2154
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,090
Does it take over your whole vision?

2155
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:49,751
No.

2156
00:55:49,751 --> 00:55:50,950
You'll have to search for it.

2157
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:51,940
You like if I'm,

2158
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,770
I can look at you right
now and that's fine,

2159
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,030
but if I go like this,

2160
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,460
there it is and then I looked at you,

2161
00:55:57,461 --> 00:55:58,420
I could see right through it.

2162
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:59,200
But then I look here,

2163
00:55:59,200 --> 00:55:59,860
there it is.

2164
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,760
It's a very small area or I mean it's,

2165
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,850
it's not like you lose it.

2166
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,210
You definitely can find it anytime you
want but it's a very small area which is

2167
00:56:07,211 --> 00:56:11,350
image exists so you could kind of
look around a way from that area.

2168
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,970
That's why the idea is that you could
have them on and walk because you could

2169
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:16,800
see everything.

2170
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,190
I wonder if there's any long term effects
from that because you know like if you

2171
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:22,290
think about like looking
at a computer screen,

2172
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,680
you're straining your eyes cause it's
kind of close or are or a lot of people

2173
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:30,220
tell you to look far away every hour or
so just so your eyes like focused on,

2174
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,550
right.

2175
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,310
I wonder if this becomes really popular
where there's going to be people just

2176
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:35,170
constantly staring at that in there.

2177
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:37,720
You're going to have a lot
of different eye problems.

2178
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,700
That's a good question.

2179
00:56:38,701 --> 00:56:40,650
And then there's also
the radiation question.

2180
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:40,950
Yeah.

2181
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:45,950
Because a cell phones emit radiation
and most folks are not aware that um,

2182
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,160
the,

2183
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:47,341
you know,

2184
00:56:47,341 --> 00:56:47,631
when you,

2185
00:56:47,631 --> 00:56:51,000
you like if you go and
research what the cell phones,

2186
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:51,300
uh,

2187
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,200
what the radiation,

2188
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:55,530
how much radiation it gives out
and what's an acceptable level.

2189
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:56,311
Yeah.

2190
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:56,610
Most,

2191
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,800
most folks aren't aware that there's a,

2192
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,450
that they have like a whole,

2193
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:01,410
you know,

2194
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:01,601
uh,

2195
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:05,430
a list of like measured radiation
effects coming off of cell phones.

2196
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:10,700
But one of the big ones is one of the
big weird parts of that is that you're

2197
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:15,600
supposed to keep the phone away from your
head in order for it to meet with the

2198
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:19,290
standards for radiation or
whatever the fuck it is.

2199
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:20,124
It comes off of them.

2200
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,200
You're supposed to have
it like right here.

2201
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,950
So you're saying it's bad to put it on
speakerphone and black people are smart

2202
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:26,810
ass the way smarter than us.

2203
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:31,370
That whole thing went by the way we
talked about that on the podcast.

2204
00:57:31,371 --> 00:57:31,820
I got,

2205
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,430
I got fucking angry
tweets from black people.

2206
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,600
You can't,

2207
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,770
cause it's not just black people.

2208
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:37,670
There's white people too,

2209
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:40,040
but it's only white people
who want to be black people.

2210
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:41,540
You know.

2211
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,120
Those are the people that also
talk in public on speakerphone.

2212
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:44,451
Yo,

2213
00:57:44,451 --> 00:57:45,650
where you at dog?

2214
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,190
Where you went because we're down
here holding it down at the mall.

2215
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:52,340
I think it's fucked up because I do
wonder how many times I've talked to

2216
00:57:52,341 --> 00:57:54,110
somebody not knowing they were doing that.

2217
00:57:54,111 --> 00:57:54,591
And then I was like,

2218
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:55,190
wait a second.

2219
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:55,401
Yeah.

2220
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:56,234
And you talked to shit.

2221
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:56,930
Yeah.

2222
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:57,090
Hey,

2223
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,490
let's go get some gay sex.

2224
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,743
Brian.

2225
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:03,580
When to my mom and dad.

2226
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:08,200
It looks like it's just
smushed up a almonds.

2227
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:09,570
I think that's what almond butter is.

2228
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:09,821
Well,

2229
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:09,971
yeah,

2230
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:10,840
like almond milk.

2231
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:11,690
It's just almond.

2232
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,521
Peanut water,

2233
00:58:12,521 --> 00:58:13,160
isn't it?

2234
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:13,993
I don't know.

2235
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,620
Maybe they had some shit to it too.

2236
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,000
They must add some shit to it.

2237
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:20,290
I don't know.

2238
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:21,360
I don't have time to look at this.

2239
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,180
Uh,

2240
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,630
but there's fats that are good for you
and fats that are not good for you.

2241
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,351
You know,

2242
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:28,810
like the kind of fats you
getting like an Avocados.

2243
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:29,644
Those are good for you.

2244
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:30,381
Yeah,

2245
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,320
and they still make me fat.

2246
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:34,580
You have the fats are good
for you too if you need them.

2247
00:58:34,581 --> 00:58:37,830
Especially like the fat
that comes from animals.

2248
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,421
So like,

2249
00:58:38,421 --> 00:58:38,990
um,

2250
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:39,380
the,

2251
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:39,920
uh,

2252
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,551
whatever,

2253
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:41,240
um,

2254
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:41,900
is in,

2255
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,140
uh,

2256
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,270
especially like grass fed animal fat,

2257
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:46,370
it's supposed to be really
healthy for your skin.

2258
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,690
Like there's something about,

2259
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,230
um,

2260
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,220
certain fats,

2261
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:49,760
you know,

2262
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,650
and fats that come from animals apparently
have a positive effect on the elastic

2263
00:58:54,651 --> 00:58:55,850
city of your skin.

2264
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,800
I don't know if that makes any sense,

2265
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:01,430
but it makes sense to me
that it's so delicious.

2266
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,080
It's so delicious.

2267
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,940
Like your body must have some need for it,

2268
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:05,840
you know,

2269
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,370
and I know the cholesterol plays
a part of brain function too.

2270
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,540
I don't know if that's totally
been misunderstood or understood.

2271
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,913
Let me find out.

2272
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,770
Cholesterol.

2273
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:16,890
That's something that Oh,

2274
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:17,960
people are always worried about.

2275
00:59:17,961 --> 00:59:18,794
Right.

2276
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,023
Um,

2277
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,580
and blood pressure.

2278
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,350
I was my blood pressure dog.

2279
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,431
Don't lie to me,

2280
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:29,264
doc.

2281
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,830
How am I doing over here?

2282
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:32,141
Yeah.

2283
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:32,974
I uh,

2284
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,790
I uh,

2285
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:36,070
just got a physical reasonably
and everything checked out,

2286
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:39,520
which is weird because I eat so random.

2287
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:40,360
Like sometimes,

2288
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,560
sometimes I do have pizza.

2289
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,240
Some days I have Kale.

2290
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,170
Some days I have,

2291
00:59:44,171 --> 00:59:45,004
you know,

2292
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,700
what's that Kinlaw that never digested
it and when I wiped my butt it falls out

2293
00:59:48,701 --> 00:59:49,630
in a bunch of pieces.

2294
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,590
Like it's trying to run away.

2295
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:52,930
Well maybe that's your body.

2296
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,280
You Digest Kale.

2297
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,800
Like mine comes out like corn or keen,

2298
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,910
I'm sorry Kim Wall like is it comes out
like corn style where it's like I've

2299
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:03,823
even touched this shit

2300
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,070
getting different kinds
of chemo than I am.

2301
01:00:06,071 --> 01:00:07,450
I'd have to look at your keenwah.

2302
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:10,883
Ah,

2303
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,940
Keith was salads before.

2304
01:00:12,941 --> 01:00:13,570
I liked that.

2305
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,950
Those keen walk cakes.

2306
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,520
Yeah.

2307
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,260
Oh I left stuff.

2308
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:16,600
Yeah.

2309
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,433
It's one of the most

2310
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,620
for as far as plant proteins,

2311
01:00:19,621 --> 01:00:21,030
one of the more complete proteins.

2312
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,210
I think it's one of the few that's
actually completely complete.

2313
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,180
I think it's like right up
there with hemp protein,

2314
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:30,300
which is a very complete
protein for a plant protein.

2315
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:31,680
Like some proteins,

2316
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,770
they don't have all the amino acids.

2317
01:00:34,771 --> 01:00:36,540
I don't have everything that like,

2318
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:36,810
uh,

2319
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,670
like there's different kinds of proteins.

2320
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,730
That's why like people that are
like strong Vegan advocates,

2321
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:42,863
they uh,

2322
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,610
especially like health and fitness nuts,

2323
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,070
they recommend you mix up the uh,

2324
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:48,980
the different foods and uh,

2325
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,450
combined like different types of proteins.

2326
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:52,171
You know,

2327
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:52,650
like a,

2328
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:52,891
you know,

2329
01:00:52,891 --> 01:00:54,030
like maybe Broccoli,

2330
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:54,571
Broccoli,

2331
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:55,860
it's like an incomplete protein,

2332
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,110
but broccoli has protein
in it and you know,

2333
01:00:58,111 --> 01:00:59,470
then throw in the,

2334
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:02,640
the powerful shit like
keen keenwah and Hamp,

2335
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:03,510
both of them were like,

2336
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,850
I think camp has all the
essential amino acids.

2337
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,793
Pretty sure

2338
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,220
you haven't had hemp milk the other day.

2339
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:10,460
Okay.

2340
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,600
If you have that stuff folks,

2341
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:12,434
it does.

2342
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,363
Just to let you know,

2343
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,570
you don't fail tests,

2344
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,650
you don't fail drug tests.

2345
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:16,220
Right.

2346
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,350
A lot of people worry about that.

2347
01:01:17,351 --> 01:01:17,481
Like,

2348
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:18,770
cause hemp protein is,

2349
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,680
it's so much easier on my body at least.

2350
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:23,540
I love like muscle milk.

2351
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,800
That shit is delicious.

2352
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,233
It's delicious.

2353
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:29,000
But that shit makes my asshole a weapon.

2354
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,370
You know?

2355
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:30,620
I,

2356
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,101
like I said,

2357
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:31,460
I can't,

2358
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,610
I can't claim Tate status
or even Joey Diaz does,

2359
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:35,810
but when I,

2360
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,340
when I drank too much,

2361
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:40,250
too much of that whey
protein that backs me out.

2362
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,360
Here's my new favorite thing.

2363
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:41,600
Uh,

2364
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,810
you can actually get it on
Amazon at pack of 12 is $20.

2365
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:49,840
It's Gogo Rice organic Chenwa and it's
these little little like they're already

2366
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:51,081
cooked.

2367
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:52,010
You just open up and eat it.

2368
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:52,821
But what I do is yeah,

2369
01:01:52,821 --> 01:01:53,431
I put sprays,

2370
01:01:53,431 --> 01:01:54,264
so my,

2371
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:58,730
I can't believe it's not butter on it
and it maybe throwing some Turkey Bacon

2372
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,010
and I just put it in the
microwave there and it's,

2373
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:04,010
it's like the perfect meal
and it's not bad for you.

2374
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:04,910
It's good for you.

2375
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:05,390
It's,

2376
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,290
it's so easy.

2377
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:07,010
It's like you can,

2378
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,000
you could just eat it.

2379
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:09,650
Like you don't even have to cook it.

2380
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,543
It's already cooked.

2381
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:11,990
It's great though.

2382
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,830
So it's very good for you too.

2383
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:14,240
Yeah.

2384
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:14,841
And by the way,

2385
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:15,591
if you know how to spell it,

2386
01:02:15,591 --> 01:02:16,424
you're an asshole.

2387
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:17,420
You're right.

2388
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:17,700
You know,

2389
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,533
spell that.

2390
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:19,350
No Way.

2391
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,183
Unless you're a cook

2392
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,290
or someone who deals
with it professionally.

2393
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,190
Q u I.

2394
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,200
How the hell do you know?

2395
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,380
And if you know how to say it,

2396
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:26,214
you're an asshole,

2397
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,660
including me.

2398
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,250
I'm going to ask all,

2399
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,740
cause I know that keen was
like a pretentious food.

2400
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,121
I think it's good.

2401
01:02:34,121 --> 01:02:34,271
I,

2402
01:02:34,271 --> 01:02:34,511
I'm a,

2403
01:02:34,511 --> 01:02:35,500
I'm a rice fan,

2404
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,450
so to me it just to feel,

2405
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:37,284
it tastes like rice.

2406
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:38,290
I love it.

2407
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:38,980
However,

2408
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,440
there's a pretentious thing to it.

2409
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:42,274
I don't know what it is,

2410
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,830
but when you say I'm going to have
some keenwah I like to have some keen.

2411
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,370
Woah.

2412
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:47,470
It's like I picture you
with like wooden beads on,

2413
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,173
you know?

2414
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:49,691
Yeah.

2415
01:02:49,691 --> 01:02:52,870
Kale is like that to me because that's
just seems like it's completely out of

2416
01:02:52,871 --> 01:02:53,561
control right now.

2417
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,030
There's tail everywhere.

2418
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,880
It's a real superfood though.

2419
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,773
Yeah.

2420
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:58,930
It's fucking delicious,

2421
01:02:58,931 --> 01:02:59,200
man.

2422
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,240
Except I've been hearing
it's dangerous to eat raw,

2423
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,130
which is weird.

2424
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:02,660
Um,

2425
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,493
there's

2426
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:08,510
people I think are worried
about is there's a small
percentage of folks that get

2427
01:03:08,581 --> 01:03:13,581
affected by a certain fungus that
can grow on chemo or I'm not Kale.

2428
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,513
Right.

2429
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:14,880
Yeah.

2430
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,211
Let's see.

2431
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:16,530
It's that fungus is pretty common.

2432
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:17,320
Okay.

2433
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:17,580
Hold on.

2434
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:17,761
Let's,

2435
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:19,410
let's pull that off and eat raw kale.

2436
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:20,700
Kale danger.

2437
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:22,430
Yeah.

2438
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:23,460
Cause I just had some,

2439
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:26,820
there's some really good
Kale going on at rollbacks.

2440
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:27,100
I think I'm,

2441
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,120
I don't know if we've talked about that.

2442
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:28,983
There's a,

2443
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,020
they have a lot of good Kale
smoothies or juices now.

2444
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:32,590
Hmm.

2445
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:35,200
Lately Tropicales the best.

2446
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,073
Um,

2447
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,740
I don't like Kale shakes.

2448
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,840
You don't know.

2449
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,500
But I like how they make me feel.

2450
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:41,920
Yeah,

2451
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,820
they're boring though.

2452
01:03:42,821 --> 01:03:43,310
I want to have,

2453
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:44,980
I wanted to have bacon
and eggs this morning.

2454
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,740
This is like,

2455
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,620
that's the Robb wolf
style way of doing it.

2456
01:03:47,621 --> 01:03:48,454
Like Paleo.

2457
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,020
But I knew how to work out in an hour
and the difference between Bacon and eggs

2458
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,600
and a Kale shake,

2459
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:55,960
his fucking tremendous.

2460
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:59,050
As far as like your ability
to work out like afterwards,

2461
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,371
like a Kale shake.

2462
01:04:00,371 --> 01:04:02,680
I could basically work
out right away in less.

2463
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,390
I haven't done my morning Dukie yet.

2464
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:05,890
Biggest,

2465
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:10,420
if you get a Kale shake in you son you
are shitting within the next 20 minutes

2466
01:04:10,421 --> 01:04:11,770
whether you like it or not.

2467
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:12,770
It's

2468
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:15,110
coming out like it's
being chased by zombies.

2469
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:20,940
It's like it's like World War z and the
toilet bowl and that's no bullshit man

2470
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,180
that those Kale shakes.

2471
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,770
It's just sludge.

2472
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:30,190
You know Kale shake is just
green vegetable like a cleaner.

2473
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:35,210
I was just like grinding out all the
stuff that's in its way just to a giant

2474
01:04:35,211 --> 01:04:37,970
blob of a universally sized,

2475
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:42,800
so it's all like your your tube
instead of like chunks of meat and shit

2476
01:04:42,801 --> 01:04:44,420
stumbling down there.

2477
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:44,871
It's,

2478
01:04:44,871 --> 01:04:46,490
there's no like chunks of anything.

2479
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:51,491
It's one giant stuffed tube of green
liquid and celery and cucumber and garlic

2480
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:56,820
and the garlic is just gangster,

2481
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:57,950
just killing everybody.

2482
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,660
Anybody that's anywhere,

2483
01:04:59,661 --> 01:05:02,270
it's like the Mongol hoards the get cause.

2484
01:05:02,271 --> 01:05:04,100
Garlic is like fantastic.

2485
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,600
You ever have anything
wrong with your stomach?

2486
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:06,733
Take garlic.

2487
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:10,160
It's incredible for like food poisoning.

2488
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:11,240
If you feel like shit,

2489
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,290
you got a stomach flu,

2490
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,420
eat cloves of garlic.

2491
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,910
It's hard to do cause you chew
on those things and you're like,

2492
01:05:17,911 --> 01:05:18,451
Whoa,

2493
01:05:18,451 --> 01:05:22,650
like are a big ass rock clove of garlic
to just toss it in your mouth and start

2494
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:23,400
chewing it.

2495
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,390
It's pretty intense.

2496
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:25,921
I know.

2497
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:26,880
You don't want to cook it man.

2498
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:27,810
You want it raw.

2499
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:32,760
That's where all the nutrition comes in
that that's where the sting comes from.

2500
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:33,990
As soon as you start cooking it,

2501
01:05:33,991 --> 01:05:37,920
you lose all that sting and I think that
sting of eating the raw garlic is just

2502
01:05:37,921 --> 01:05:41,300
what's just gangster just goes
into your body and starts fine.

2503
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:45,750
It's like a fucking sword
wielding barbarian just
hacks up all the shit in your

2504
01:05:45,751 --> 01:05:46,500
body.

2505
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,520
I think that's why one of my favorite
remedies ever for like anything that's

2506
01:05:50,521 --> 01:05:51,540
ailing my stomach.

2507
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:56,570
Garlic just fucking cleans everything
out and you just the the shifts that come

2508
01:05:56,851 --> 01:05:57,330
out when you,

2509
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,190
when you eat like cloves of garlic,

2510
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:02,730
it's like literally like a bunch
of bodies being dropped off like a,

2511
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,170
like a bulldozer pulls up.

2512
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:04,680
Dean,

2513
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,513
Dean.

2514
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:11,370
It's just all dead bacteria that the
garlic assassinated inside your bacterial

2515
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:13,434
tract.

2516
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:14,970
Digestive tract rather.

2517
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:15,931
Yeah,

2518
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:16,361
we got it.

2519
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:19,590
That's a weird thing that we have to
have those little things inside of us.

2520
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:20,790
You have to have them.

2521
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,960
If you don't have them,

2522
01:06:21,961 --> 01:06:22,794
you're sick.

2523
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,040
You have to have a community in your body.

2524
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,083
Pretty Weird.

2525
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:29,490
I mean,

2526
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:31,170
did you even know that
until you were like,

2527
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,310
I was like 30 I think when I found
that out later than that for me.

2528
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:36,810
But just stop and think about that.

2529
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:39,720
Living your whole life
and then one day you go,

2530
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,140
Whoa,

2531
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,070
what's in me?

2532
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:42,743
Flora?

2533
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:43,500
What?

2534
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:43,920
Skit?

2535
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,880
Acidophilus.

2536
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,833
It's alive.

2537
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,780
Sure it doesn't that seem more important
to you to teach your kids things like

2538
01:06:48,781 --> 01:06:49,890
that instead of like Shit,

2539
01:06:49,891 --> 01:06:52,440
like uh Oh this guy read a horse until it,

2540
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:56,100
the whole town people are coming and we
should do a whole report about this guy.

2541
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,480
I don't know if we really knew
about it like when did they really?

2542
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:01,980
Yeah,

2543
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,430
but hearing the zooming body,

2544
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:06,940
there's so many things that they don't
teach you growing up that are so fucking

2545
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:07,511
important.

2546
01:07:07,511 --> 01:07:09,040
Like like credit cards,

2547
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,840
finance charges and things like that.

2548
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,880
When I got my first credit card,

2549
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,320
I was still in high school.

2550
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,071
I was like,

2551
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,341
what?

2552
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:18,070
$500 credit limit I could
buy whatever I want,

2553
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,880
$500 laser disc player and then
the next thing I'm though I'm like,

2554
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:22,151
oh,

2555
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:22,661
I don't have to,

2556
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:23,590
I don't have any money.

2557
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:23,891
I'm not.

2558
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:24,910
I'm just going to wait a couple months.

2559
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:25,600
And next thing I know,

2560
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,270
I ruined my whole entire
credit by the age of 19.

2561
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,470
And you know why?

2562
01:07:29,471 --> 01:07:31,360
Because they didn't teach
that in high school.

2563
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:31,990
They and,

2564
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,000
and then credit card companies
just gave me a credit card.

2565
01:07:34,001 --> 01:07:34,331
Right.

2566
01:07:34,331 --> 01:07:34,840
Fresh,

2567
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,650
you know,

2568
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:36,401
but guess what,

2569
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:37,151
if they taught you,

2570
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:37,984
you wouldn't listen.

2571
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:39,833
Uh,

2572
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,660
Saru but I,

2573
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:43,360
unless that at the end of the class that,

2574
01:07:43,361 --> 01:07:45,650
that we all signed up to get credit cards.

2575
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:46,311
Well,

2576
01:07:46,311 --> 01:07:47,400
I think though that dat,

2577
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:51,470
you don't also represents the fact that
that whole thing was fairly new back

2578
01:07:51,471 --> 01:07:52,220
then.

2579
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:55,820
Credit cards and credit and credit
issues and people having credit problems.

2580
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:56,654
It's fairly new.

2581
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:57,770
You had been in the 90s.

2582
01:07:57,771 --> 01:07:58,310
I mean,

2583
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:58,530
yeah,

2584
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,260
but look,

2585
01:08:00,261 --> 01:08:01,220
I'm going to go a guy,

2586
01:08:01,221 --> 01:08:01,470
hi.

2587
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:02,303
I know a guy,

2588
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,930
I know a guy,

2589
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,710
his name was international sal and
I know I've talked about him before.

2590
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:08,993
He was a,

2591
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:14,010
a god that I used to know from my pool
hall days and he was one of the first

2592
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:15,890
guys to go to jail for card fraud.

2593
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,211
He,

2594
01:08:17,211 --> 01:08:18,044
uh,

2595
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:23,080
was the first guy or one of the first
guys to figure out that you could take the

2596
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:24,170
imprints,

2597
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:24,771
like with some of them,

2598
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:25,604
make a credit card,

2599
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,600
you could take them and then take
that number and then go print your own

2600
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:30,710
separate card.

2601
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:32,600
And then when you print
your own separate card,

2602
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:35,000
you just go off like a rocket and just,

2603
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,140
you know,

2604
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:40,070
you got your own separate shit printed
and you just start fucking charging up a

2605
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:42,560
storm and then by the time
this guy gets the bill,

2606
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,693
it's too late.

2607
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,121
Well,

2608
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,350
these guys would do that.

2609
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:50,470
They would take these cards and then they
would buy things like gigantic things

2610
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,600
and then they would bring those
things back and get money.

2611
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:54,591
They'll go,

2612
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:54,831
yeah,

2613
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:55,230
you know,

2614
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:55,471
I'll,

2615
01:08:55,471 --> 01:08:55,581
I,

2616
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:56,061
I bought it.

2617
01:08:56,061 --> 01:08:56,780
I didn't like it.

2618
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,610
So they bring them back and then boom,

2619
01:08:58,790 --> 01:08:59,541
they got all this money.

2620
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:04,541
So they use these credit cards and getting
paid back cash or they're selling the

2621
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:05,750
items that they buy.

2622
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:09,470
Like they'll buy a car and
then sell it for 20 grand,

2623
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:10,160
you know,

2624
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,930
and sell it once they sell it to.

2625
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:12,261
I mean,

2626
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:12,590
I dunno,

2627
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,570
I dunno how the fuck you can't track it,

2628
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:15,320
but this was,

2629
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,490
this was a long ass time ago.

2630
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:21,491
I met the guy in 92 and he had just gotten
out of jail or maybe got out of jail

2631
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:23,144
in 93,

2632
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:24,590
somewhere around that.

2633
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:25,910
And uh,

2634
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,320
this guy made millions.

2635
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,510
He was a loser at Campbell thing.

2636
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:30,390
I mean,

2637
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:34,100
I say that in the most respectful way
possible because he was a very nice guy.

2638
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:36,890
What I mean is that he
would find a way to lose.

2639
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,140
It was the weirdest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

2640
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,430
He used to bet big,

2641
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:44,860
big money and he would be down on the
ball and it'd be the very last nine ball.

2642
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,090
You see his arm shaking,

2643
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:46,881
he looks at it and,

2644
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:47,391
but those are,

2645
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,370
the dude just drives
it right into the rail.

2646
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:50,071
And,

2647
01:09:50,071 --> 01:09:50,480
and you would,

2648
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,600
you would swear that no one
could ever miss that shot,

2649
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:55,190
but he would find a way to miss it.

2650
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,360
And he played good pool.

2651
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,313
He played good,

2652
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,310
but he was just,

2653
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,190
he was just addicted to losing.

2654
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,720
It's like for whatever reason,

2655
01:10:02,721 --> 01:10:06,410
he had a psychological block that he
couldn't overcome when he came to winning

2656
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:06,621
money.

2657
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:07,520
I don't think I ever saw him.

2658
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,540
Maybe one time,

2659
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:09,770
I think I saw him win some money,

2660
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,930
but that was like probably
somebody laid down on them.

2661
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:16,130
Just kind of get them to raise the bet
for the next time and he would gamble

2662
01:10:16,131 --> 01:10:17,780
away millions of dollars.

2663
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,670
So he would be at the pool hall.

2664
01:10:19,671 --> 01:10:19,911
Okay.

2665
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:22,790
These guys would come and
literally with bags of money,

2666
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:25,160
a key had the whole thing set up,

2667
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:26,360
making the credit cards,

2668
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,820
putting these guys in the street and they
come back with cash and they divvy it

2669
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:29,240
up.

2670
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:29,571
He said,

2671
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:29,811
guys,

2672
01:10:29,811 --> 01:10:33,260
we're coming back with just
bags and bags and bags of money.

2673
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:36,740
And so when you know people were
calling him international sal because

2674
01:10:36,741 --> 01:10:40,730
apparently they're buying shit and Paris
and Pine Shit in England and they take

2675
01:10:40,731 --> 01:10:44,330
fucking plane flights with these credit
cards and no one could track anything.

2676
01:10:44,331 --> 01:10:47,300
Back then you couldn't find
out who they were back then.

2677
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,830
You got on a plane,

2678
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,480
you didn't even have to show an ID.

2679
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:52,070
You just got on a plane.

2680
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,890
Like when I used to travel for DYC
winnowed tournament's when I was a kid,

2681
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,000
I didn't have any ID.

2682
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:56,900
He didn't need Id.

2683
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:57,770
Nobody had ID.

2684
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,360
You just get on a plane and go.

2685
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,370
I'd flew across the country.

2686
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:01,821
Just all,

2687
01:11:01,821 --> 01:11:02,654
I did a show up.

2688
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,210
I didn't even,

2689
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:03,661
I don't think of that.

2690
01:11:03,661 --> 01:11:05,030
I think I had a fucking driver's license.

2691
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:05,571
I think.

2692
01:11:05,571 --> 01:11:06,051
Not only that,

2693
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:06,741
if we got to the gate,

2694
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:07,011
I was like,

2695
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:07,460
you know what dude,

2696
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:08,540
I don't want to go here.

2697
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:09,121
Take my ticker.

2698
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:09,650
You can go.

2699
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:10,580
You'd be able to go.

2700
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,560
You would be able to get
right on that fucking plane.

2701
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:13,780
That'd be awesome.

2702
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,560
That'd be awesome.

2703
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,090
The people used to sell tickets.

2704
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:16,650
He's,

2705
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:17,770
you'd be able to sell a ticket.

2706
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:18,041
Like,

2707
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:19,000
does anybody want my ticket?

2708
01:11:19,001 --> 01:11:19,630
I'm um,

2709
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:19,871
you know,

2710
01:11:19,871 --> 01:11:20,950
you'd be able to put it in the paper.

2711
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,030
Did you ever fly when there
was smoking on the plane?

2712
01:11:23,031 --> 01:11:25,010
Because I don't remember doing it.

2713
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,440
Fucking Luli absolutely.

2714
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,940
I remember that clearly.

2715
01:11:28,941 --> 01:11:29,660
Like this is,

2716
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,810
I remember it being sad and twisted.

2717
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:33,741
You know,

2718
01:11:33,741 --> 01:11:38,000
you're looking back at this whole cloud
of smoke and these people are absorbing

2719
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:42,050
it with no recourse and the idea that
it's going to be contained in the back

2720
01:11:42,051 --> 01:11:45,140
area of his fucking tube of recycled air,

2721
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:47,400
the three circulated this,

2722
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:49,700
the same air is used over
and over and over again.

2723
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:53,120
Like you're going to get that smoke in
your body no matter if you're in the

2724
01:11:53,121 --> 01:11:54,890
front or the back that smokes getting.

2725
01:11:54,891 --> 01:11:55,510
Yeah.

2726
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:56,031
So these,

2727
01:11:56,031 --> 01:11:56,864
a little bit of it.

2728
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:58,320
I uh,

2729
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,870
somebody just contacted me
from my past the other day.

2730
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:02,830
A dude he used to fuck no,

2731
01:12:02,831 --> 01:12:02,971
no,

2732
01:12:02,971 --> 01:12:03,151
no.

2733
01:12:03,151 --> 01:12:03,291
When,

2734
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,950
when I was in high school,

2735
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,180
I worked at this movie theater.

2736
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:11,181
I was a projectionist and this other guy
that was in college and he was like one

2737
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,600
of these guys that smoke.

2738
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:15,660
He's the one that introduced me to
marijuana and when I was like 15,

2739
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:18,211
like Vic,

2740
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:20,760
careful what you say because that's
illegal and not going to say who it is.

2741
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:21,560
Okay.

2742
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,480
They might hold you
over the fire until you

2743
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:24,630
all right.

2744
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:25,051
And,

2745
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:25,210
uh,

2746
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:26,030
he's still,

2747
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:30,120
but he used to like invite us to his
college parties and every weekend we would

2748
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:32,940
party with college people
and we're in like 15,

2749
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:33,631
16 years old.

2750
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:35,040
We just got her driver's license.

2751
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:38,270
I think I've told him in the past hygge
how I took all these shots I've ever

2752
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:38,941
clear once.

2753
01:12:38,941 --> 01:12:41,310
And they got pulled over and the
cop gave me money for coffee.

2754
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:42,510
You just told me to sit in my car.

2755
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:43,440
Same,

2756
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,273
same person.

2757
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,450
That was when you were in high school?

2758
01:12:45,451 --> 01:12:45,930
That happened?

2759
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:46,171
Yeah.

2760
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:46,620
Yeah.

2761
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,281
Oh my God.

2762
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:48,150
What a crazy cop.

2763
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:48,670
Yeah,

2764
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:49,220
I know.

2765
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,053
I crop was nuts.

2766
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:50,510
I don't know.

2767
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:51,960
Maybe he's just been there,

2768
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:52,710
done that.

2769
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:53,280
Yeah.

2770
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:53,911
I also,

2771
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:54,180
I,

2772
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,013
I he probably,

2773
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:56,663
I don't know.

2774
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:57,331
But uh,

2775
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,890
so th one thing I remembered though there,

2776
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:01,350
I think they were all Italian,

2777
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,370
all the guys like,

2778
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,390
and uh,

2779
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:04,560
the more you'll know about Ohio,

2780
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:06,930
there's a lot of like mafia
and stuff like in Ohio,

2781
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:07,470
but I,

2782
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,430
I think I hung out.

2783
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,920
I think they all were
kind of in that group,

2784
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:11,820
you know,

2785
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,210
looking back at it now you,

2786
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,160
we're just super high and right.

2787
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,530
Like a parent when
everyone's in the Mafia.

2788
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:17,850
I know,

2789
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,230
but just looking back at it,

2790
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:21,120
it just seemed like it was,

2791
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,333
but uh,

2792
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:22,770
like,

2793
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:22,951
uh,

2794
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:26,730
he would have these like pretty big
parties every weekend and his friend would

2795
01:13:26,731 --> 01:13:29,850
come into town from Youngstown or
something like that every weekend.

2796
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:32,280
And his sister was like,

2797
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:33,810
I thought she was okay,

2798
01:13:33,811 --> 01:13:36,180
but she was not the prettiest girl.

2799
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,580
And she was like little older than me.

2800
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,540
She's like three years
older than me and he,

2801
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:44,640
he would bring his sister down just so
she can fuck me because she doesn't get

2802
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:47,880
attention or get any guys
from where she lives.

2803
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:48,893
So I,

2804
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,160
she would come in the room we hit,

2805
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,240
they would come in there and be like,

2806
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:51,841
and I'll be like,

2807
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:51,931
oh,

2808
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:52,051
hey,

2809
01:13:52,051 --> 01:13:52,620
how's it going?

2810
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:54,900
And then later that day at
night would go up to his,

2811
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:55,350
uh,

2812
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:57,300
the guy that lives there
is room and would fuck.

2813
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,170
And it was really weird because we never
else talked throughout the whole day,

2814
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,033
you know,

2815
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,500
and I just would fuck his sister forum.

2816
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,170
You didn't talk to her?

2817
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:07,921
Not really.

2818
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:08,910
Just like when we fuck,

2819
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:12,080
but like I didn't like
ever know her phone number.

2820
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:14,810
I never liked in the
more I'm looking back,

2821
01:14:14,811 --> 01:14:16,700
I think I'm blocking a lot of shit

2822
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:22,670
because I was thinking about
this because I was like,

2823
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:24,830
why did I never get that girl's number?

2824
01:14:24,831 --> 01:14:25,420
Why?

2825
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,680
But why did I never talked to her?

2826
01:14:27,681 --> 01:14:32,540
I would only remember I fucked her like
maybe 10 times and she would only be in

2827
01:14:32,541 --> 01:14:33,500
town once in a while.

2828
01:14:33,501 --> 01:14:34,610
And every time it was always like,

2829
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:35,001
all right,

2830
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:35,840
let's go upstairs.

2831
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:38,030
And if sometimes that's just how it is,

2832
01:14:38,031 --> 01:14:39,020
that's the relationship.

2833
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:40,700
Sometimes that's how it is.

2834
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:42,230
Like you don't have a lot in common.

2835
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:43,340
You don't want to talk,

2836
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,450
but you like to fuck you.

2837
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:47,090
But I remember him going
the first time like,

2838
01:14:47,091 --> 01:14:47,960
hey my sister,

2839
01:14:47,961 --> 01:14:48,231
you know,

2840
01:14:48,231 --> 01:14:49,010
would you want to go up there?

2841
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:49,843
You want me to fuck fucker,

2842
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:50,810
you can do it.

2843
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,011
Trust me.

2844
01:14:52,011 --> 01:14:52,731
Do she wants it?

2845
01:14:52,731 --> 01:14:53,211
She can just,

2846
01:14:53,211 --> 01:14:53,921
she's very lonely.

2847
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:54,754
She's nice girl.

2848
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:57,920
And I remember doing it and then it became
a thing where every weekend he would

2849
01:14:57,921 --> 01:15:00,170
bring her so she likes some Dick.

2850
01:15:00,171 --> 01:15:01,220
And you were giving us some Dick.

2851
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,170
Why you want to overanalyze things?

2852
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:07,700
Cause it's so weird looking back at
shit completely blocked out your whole

2853
01:15:07,701 --> 01:15:08,570
entire life.

2854
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,733
You know what I mean?

2855
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,380
Like looking back like
why was I doing this?

2856
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,431
Well not only that,

2857
01:15:13,431 --> 01:15:15,080
like your memories are so weird.

2858
01:15:15,081 --> 01:15:15,914
Anyway.

2859
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,800
Memories or just whenever
it was once I was like,

2860
01:15:18,801 --> 01:15:20,090
I remember like the thick,

2861
01:15:20,091 --> 01:15:23,570
clearest things that I
remember ever in my life.

2862
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:28,750
I could tell people but I can't say for
certainty how much of what I'm saying is

2863
01:15:30,231 --> 01:15:34,100
what I remember and how much I'm saying
is what I remember saying about what I

2864
01:15:34,101 --> 01:15:34,934
remember.

2865
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,133
You know,

2866
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:36,920
like how,

2867
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,560
like like traumatic moments for one thing,

2868
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:43,460
like a lot of people that have
been through some fucked up shit,

2869
01:15:43,461 --> 01:15:47,030
whether it's a violence
situation or you know,

2870
01:15:47,031 --> 01:15:50,600
a car accident or anything
where you really remember
it when you go back and try

2871
01:15:50,601 --> 01:15:50,721
to,

2872
01:15:50,721 --> 01:15:51,530
like,

2873
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:53,360
especially if it's more
than like 10 years old,

2874
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:56,450
if you go back and try to recreate it
when you're explaining it to people,

2875
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:59,810
like if someone could see your memories,

2876
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:00,680
they would go,

2877
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,041
oh,

2878
01:16:01,041 --> 01:16:02,360
that's all you're working with here.

2879
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:03,750
Like Jesus Christ,

2880
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:05,390
she's barely remember
this fucking thing at all.

2881
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:07,640
Like if I could see your actual memories,

2882
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:08,270
I'd be like,

2883
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:08,661
Oh yeah,

2884
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:10,610
that car looks red and yeah.

2885
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,150
Um,

2886
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:14,270
you have some words that you've
memorized about what happened.

2887
01:16:14,271 --> 01:16:14,900
Um,

2888
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,040
but your actual,

2889
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:16,431
yeah,

2890
01:16:16,431 --> 01:16:17,600
you know the facts,

2891
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,460
you know the facts as far as like,

2892
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:22,340
you know where you were
and what took place.

2893
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:25,220
But as far as like you remembering
what actually happened,

2894
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,083
seeing it,

2895
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:27,560
unless it's a while ago,

2896
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,040
it's hard to beat off the girls
that you fucked a decade ago.

2897
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:32,300
You think about that.

2898
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:33,360
I can't,

2899
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,280
do you think you could?

2900
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:35,390
No,

2901
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:35,990
no.

2902
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,610
If you,

2903
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:37,190
I don't think,

2904
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:37,881
well you could,

2905
01:16:37,881 --> 01:16:42,050
I mean obviously you could beat off to
girls that you fucked when you were 16

2906
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,910
but you're going to be making it all up,

2907
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:44,790
right?

2908
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:45,080
No,

2909
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,010
I mean I haven't videotaping me has 15.

2910
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,820
Don't tell the people
that do watch myself.

2911
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,241
No,

2912
01:16:51,241 --> 01:16:51,990
it's illegal.

2913
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,700
I think it's child pornography really?

2914
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,570
I'm pretty sure.

2915
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:54,810
Yeah,

2916
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:55,470
watch myself.

2917
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:56,730
I mean I don't have this video.

2918
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,170
Well not only can you not watch it,

2919
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:59,490
it's illegal for you to have it.

2920
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:00,151
In fact,

2921
01:17:00,151 --> 01:17:04,140
it's a bit of my act that I'm doing
about a girl who got arrested for child

2922
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:07,680
pornography because she was sending
boys in her class pictures of her pussy.

2923
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:11,740
They arrested her with child
pornography and they had to um,

2924
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:12,840
they had the,

2925
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,570
they had a quitter of that,

2926
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:15,680
but they,

2927
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:21,070
they charged her with the use of a
criminal tool and that criminal tool was a

2928
01:17:21,651 --> 01:17:22,484
cell phone.

2929
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:24,050
It says Solo masturbating.

2930
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:25,520
So they can go after me.

2931
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:26,300
What Watch,

2932
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,380
I think it's illegal.

2933
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,453
That would be weird.

2934
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,410
Like really into,

2935
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:30,891
well dude,

2936
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:31,280
that guy,

2937
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,190
that girl got arrested
like a really has happened.

2938
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:38,570
So it's just one of those
literal translations of the law.

2939
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:39,890
It doesn't make sense.

2940
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:41,323
You know,

2941
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,980
the girl she was sending,

2942
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:43,641
the idea,

2943
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:47,120
I guess is that she shouldn't be doing
that and they have to stop her because

2944
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:49,370
pedos could get ahold of it
and just start beating off.

2945
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:50,780
That's true.

2946
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:52,100
That's what the idea is,

2947
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,140
is that this boy probably has a big mouth.

2948
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:57,350
Can't believe this girls sending her a
picture around everybody in the class.

2949
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,250
And so,

2950
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:58,551
you know,

2951
01:17:58,551 --> 01:17:59,384
next thing you know,

2952
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:00,283
he puts it on,

2953
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:00,680
you know,

2954
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,260
I like to fuck kids.com and then boom,

2955
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:04,371
hey,

2956
01:18:04,371 --> 01:18:05,031
whoever you are,

2957
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:05,660
don't put,

2958
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:08,930
I like to fuck kids.com and then
forward that shit to my website.

2959
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:11,240
You sons of bitches,

2960
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:13,370
she fucking dare.

2961
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,480
That's actually a good idea not to stop
it in its tracks because I know someone

2962
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:18,650
already thought of it like

2963
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,780
finding domains and pointing it to
towards people and they're like,

2964
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:22,861
oh,

2965
01:18:22,861 --> 01:18:24,320
look what he believes in.

2966
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:26,720
It's a forward.

2967
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:27,861
Yeah.

2968
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:28,131
Well,

2969
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:28,371
you know,

2970
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:29,570
that's one of the things that,

2971
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:30,260
uh,

2972
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:31,093
this guy,

2973
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:34,820
I don't want to say his name because
I don't know what the fuck actually

2974
01:18:34,821 --> 01:18:35,301
happened.

2975
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:36,770
I don't know what he's actually guilty of,

2976
01:18:36,771 --> 01:18:37,940
so I'll not say his name,

2977
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:39,110
but he was,

2978
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:39,470
uh,

2979
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:40,840
involved in a,

2980
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:44,480
a sex scandal and he
bought the domain name,

2981
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,590
his name,

2982
01:18:45,591 --> 01:18:47,420
and then the word rape behind it,

2983
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,500
like right afterwards,

2984
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:50,090
so nobody else could get it,

2985
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:51,260
you know,

2986
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,290
which is kind of crazy like that.

2987
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:54,343
And then,

2988
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:55,760
you know,

2989
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,511
everybody was like,

2990
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:56,811
wow,

2991
01:18:56,811 --> 01:18:57,650
why did you do that?

2992
01:18:57,651 --> 01:18:58,430
Like,

2993
01:18:58,430 --> 01:18:58,881
like you're,

2994
01:18:58,881 --> 01:18:59,120
you're,

2995
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,070
you're marketing your truth.

2996
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:01,551
You know,

2997
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:06,020
you're like when a guy like gets in
trouble for something and then you realize

2998
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:10,310
that everything he's saying as far as
like talking about it and discussing it is

2999
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:11,570
like a marketing strategy.

3000
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:13,130
If he's like a professional marketer,

3001
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:13,791
you know,

3002
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,060
you immediately go,

3003
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,040
wait a minute,

3004
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:16,874
man.

3005
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:18,831
Marketers,

3006
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:19,370
that's it.

3007
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:21,110
The whole thing is weird because like,

3008
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,570
I like to know about cool shit,

3009
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,171
you know?

3010
01:19:24,171 --> 01:19:26,390
And if I see a commercial
for like a new phone,

3011
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,190
they're explaining to me
all the different stuff.

3012
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:28,640
It doesn't like,

3013
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,250
Ooh,

3014
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:29,550
oh,

3015
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:30,171
I love it.

3016
01:19:30,171 --> 01:19:31,004
That's great.

3017
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:32,143
I love it.

3018
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:33,350
Um,

3019
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:36,950
but when I see like scams,

3020
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:42,340
like this same guy had this thing
promoting a player lifestyle and uh,

3021
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,271
it was,

3022
01:19:44,271 --> 01:19:45,560
you were going to get advice,

3023
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:49,640
it was like five grand for like three
days in Vegas and you were going to get

3024
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:51,260
advice from this dude.

3025
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:56,440
Who is this a super wizard
when it comes to economics,

3026
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:01,040
he just knows how to do it and the
guy lives in the middle of the desert.

3027
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:02,300
Like he's a wreck lose,

3028
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,470
he never comes out.

3029
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:04,490
He's a genius.

3030
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:05,421
But you know,

3031
01:20:05,421 --> 01:20:07,980
I have to deal with this
bullshit because he's so smart

3032
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:08,481
and he,

3033
01:20:08,481 --> 01:20:12,360
he is the reason why I'm so successful
and he can make you successful too.

3034
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:13,170
And they're like,

3035
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:17,040
then he has this email from the guy
and the email from the guy is like,

3036
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:17,720
you know,

3037
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,610
only send me real players,

3038
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:21,151
you know,

3039
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:25,650
not chicken shits and panty waist and
only people ready to push in all their

3040
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:27,000
chips right now.

3041
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,901
You know,

3042
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:29,070
and this guy,

3043
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,211
this,

3044
01:20:30,211 --> 01:20:30,690
this,

3045
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:32,940
this stupid thing that he said,

3046
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,770
it turns out to be a draft.

3047
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:38,170
So he never really received
this email from the guy.

3048
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:41,460
The photo that he put on
his website is have a draft.

3049
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:44,670
So people look at you like
you wrote that yourself,

3050
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:47,250
like you wrote that yourself,

3051
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,290
you made a letter to yourself pretending
you're this other guy who's this

3052
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:56,730
economic wizard and you think I'm so
fucking dumb that I look at that and I

3053
01:20:56,731 --> 01:20:57,060
don't know.

3054
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:01,590
It's a draft where it says save as
like the whole like and everyone's like

3055
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:01,981
that's the,

3056
01:21:01,981 --> 01:21:02,820
that's a draft.

3057
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:03,481
That's what it looks like.

3058
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:04,314
It's on an email.

3059
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:09,270
So he says he had addressed this because
if the internet goes crazy he says,

3060
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:09,751
well,

3061
01:21:09,751 --> 01:21:10,584
which is good.

3062
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:12,780
The truth is actually
stranger than fiction.

3063
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:14,430
You're not going to believe this.

3064
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,360
But this guy is so crazy that he didn't
want to send me an email with that

3065
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:20,760
information cause he thought
it could be intercepted.

3066
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,620
So he sent me an email of a
picture that he took of that email.

3067
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:27,460
Okay.

3068
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:32,460
Like how fucking dumb is that excuse
that you think that if someone can

3069
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:33,790
intercept an email,

3070
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:36,160
they can't understand an
email with a picture in it.

3071
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:39,010
And a picture of an email
that's impossible to read.

3072
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:41,560
Thank God you fucking good
precedent to jpeg form.

3073
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,870
It's not like anybody has a jpeg reader.

3074
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:46,750
What the fuck are you
even talking about man?

3075
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,980
And this guy had this whole
scam planned before his,

3076
01:21:50,981 --> 01:21:51,400
um,

3077
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:51,791
his,

3078
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:54,430
his like situation blew up this,

3079
01:21:54,431 --> 01:21:55,060
um,

3080
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:55,721
sexual,

3081
01:21:55,721 --> 01:21:57,340
we'll call it a sexual situation.

3082
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:58,390
Um,

3083
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,370
but watching that,

3084
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:04,150
that little reading rather that
website that was dedicated to the,

3085
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:04,811
to players.

3086
01:22:04,811 --> 01:22:05,740
Let me see if I can find it,

3087
01:22:05,741 --> 01:22:06,160
man.

3088
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:09,430
I think it's like the
pure player lifestyle.com.

3089
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:11,020
Hold on,

3090
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:14,230
Catherine Zeta Jones just checked
herself in for bipolar disorder.

3091
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:15,180
I wonder,

3092
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,013
I wonder if that's true.

3093
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:19,960
Michael Douglas is Dick for
10 years you would be bipolar.

3094
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:20,951
I just say.

3095
01:22:20,951 --> 01:22:22,630
Or Michael Douglas is a pimp.

3096
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:25,480
Like he's this crazy woman sperm.

3097
01:22:25,481 --> 01:22:26,350
He shooting into her.

3098
01:22:26,351 --> 01:22:27,460
What kind of pills he's on.

3099
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:28,563
Poor girl.

3100
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:30,803
Yeah.

3101
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,520
Player lifestyle seminar.

3102
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,371
Yeah.

3103
01:22:41,371 --> 01:22:42,204
That sucks.

3104
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:42,670
It's,

3105
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:44,640
it sucks whenever anybody goes crazy.

3106
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,553
And that's uh,

3107
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:47,060
that's a,

3108
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:50,610
she's got to go to the
real player lifestyle.com.

3109
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:51,750
She's still hot,

3110
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:52,290
dude.

3111
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:55,170
She was in a movie recently that I
watched where she played a lesbian,

3112
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,310
a lesbian.

3113
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:57,203
Um,

3114
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:57,870
uh,

3115
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:58,703
what was it?

3116
01:22:59,180 --> 01:22:59,431
A,

3117
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:02,490
I'm like a therapist for some crazy bitch.

3118
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:03,121
It was called,

3119
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:04,440
I think it was called side effects.

3120
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,261
Don't,

3121
01:23:05,261 --> 01:23:05,921
let's scroll up.

3122
01:23:05,921 --> 01:23:06,401
Scroll up,

3123
01:23:06,401 --> 01:23:07,234
scroll up.

3124
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,230
Don't I want,

3125
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,390
don't want to show pictures of
the dude's face but too late.

3126
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:10,991
Well,

3127
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:11,910
you already said the website.

3128
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:12,880
I didn't say his name.

3129
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:13,081
No,

3130
01:23:13,081 --> 01:23:13,390
no,

3131
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,223
no.

3132
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:16,803
I don't know what happened.

3133
01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:18,940
This is my take on it.

3134
01:23:18,941 --> 01:23:19,774
I don't know what happened.

3135
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:20,360
I don't know.

3136
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:20,890
Yeah,

3137
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:22,030
I dunno what the fuck happened.

3138
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,530
But this shit,

3139
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,690
this website's shit is not good.

3140
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:29,020
It's not indicative of a
person to find character.

3141
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:33,640
This is indicative of person is trying
to rip people off and you looking at it

3142
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:34,570
and you see where it says,

3143
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,880
it shows the email and look at the bottom.

3144
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:39,760
It's like an explanation
for the email read.

3145
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:42,010
It explains like,

3146
01:23:42,011 --> 01:23:42,610
why,

3147
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:42,881
you know,

3148
01:23:42,881 --> 01:23:43,750
people say,

3149
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:44,321
you know,

3150
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:44,711
could you read,

3151
01:23:44,711 --> 01:23:46,420
I can't read that cause it,

3152
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:47,470
when it's blown up on the screen,

3153
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:49,300
I can't read it at all.

3154
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:50,350
Uh,

3155
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:50,660
the,

3156
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:51,970
you want me to read the last thing?

3157
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:52,241
No,

3158
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:52,421
no,

3159
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:52,631
no,

3160
01:23:52,631 --> 01:23:52,811
no,

3161
01:23:52,811 --> 01:23:52,961
no.

3162
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:57,070
There's like a disclaimer like
why it's a jpeg of a picture.

3163
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:57,570
Yeah,

3164
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:58,270
I'll find it.

3165
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:59,110
Don't worry about it.

3166
01:23:59,310 --> 01:23:59,580
I'll,

3167
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:00,161
I'll find it.

3168
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:00,994
I'll read it.

3169
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,440
It's hilarious.

3170
01:24:02,441 --> 01:24:03,490
It's so stupid.

3171
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,780
It's just so silly.

3172
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:10,483
Hmm.

3173
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:15,683
Interesting.

3174
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:16,913
Yeah.

3175
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:24,190
It's like the whole idea is that and
bought knowing that he calls the Guy Mr x

3176
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:28,820
and the guy's photo on the website
is like a hat in front of his eyes.

3177
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,040
It's so dumb.

3178
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:32,030
It's like,

3179
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:35,540
it's really designed for like
the dumbest of dumb people.

3180
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:40,160
It's really designed for desperate people
that are like mentally challenged to

3181
01:24:40,161 --> 01:24:41,930
fundamental money making secrets.

3182
01:24:41,931 --> 01:24:46,550
I've held back for years and fundamental
moneymaking as all in capital letters

3183
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:51,170
years is in capital that I'll set are the
most responsible for virtually all the

3184
01:24:51,171 --> 01:24:52,700
financial success I've had in my life.

3185
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:56,810
The idea that people say like there's
a place that you meet me at this place.

3186
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:57,590
Okay.

3187
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:58,550
I'm going to tell you the secret.

3188
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:00,260
I'm going to tell you how to get rich.

3189
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,090
You know,

3190
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:06,870
this could be done like the right way.

3191
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:08,561
Well,

3192
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:09,880
you could like have a seminar.

3193
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:10,753
I'm sure they do.

3194
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:14,380
Where you go when you talked to like
business experts who give you strategies

3195
01:25:14,381 --> 01:25:15,460
that you can employ in your business.

3196
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:16,803
You know,

3197
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:19,160
chances that you know or or,

3198
01:25:19,161 --> 01:25:22,770
or places where they tell you what
chances to take and you know what's a,

3199
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:23,041
what,

3200
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:24,820
what is play it paid off for them.

3201
01:25:24,821 --> 01:25:28,300
What's a good strategy as far as marketing
and like that's without a doubt you

3202
01:25:28,301 --> 01:25:31,150
can learn at a seminar
for something like that.

3203
01:25:31,151 --> 01:25:33,190
There's a lot of experts out there
that are really good at that shit,

3204
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:36,670
but the type of person
that would write this,

3205
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:41,620
this is not indicative of the type of
person who has like a lot of great advice

3206
01:25:41,621 --> 01:25:42,190
to give out.

3207
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:45,880
This is the type of website that's
indicative of a person who's trying to rip

3208
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:46,714
you off.

3209
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:47,500
This is a trap.

3210
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,590
This is the person who's just trying
to lie to you and get tons of cash from

3211
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:51,424
you.

3212
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,663
That's crazy eyes.

3213
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:54,540
Well,

3214
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:56,120
there's a lot of scammers ladder,

3215
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:59,820
pyramid scams that have to do with
all kinds of listen to this when it's,

3216
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,110
when they busted him on the,

3217
01:26:01,111 --> 01:26:01,540
uh,

3218
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,890
on listen,

3219
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,130
when they busted him on the,

3220
01:26:04,131 --> 01:26:04,964
um,

3221
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:05,420
the,

3222
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:06,380
the draft,

3223
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:06,831
he goes,

3224
01:26:06,831 --> 01:26:08,390
some people asked me,

3225
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:09,120
why post it?

3226
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,550
Why is this a draft of an email?

3227
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,070
I asked mister crazy
pants the same question.

3228
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:13,521
Well,

3229
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:14,480
now you go,

3230
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:16,700
now you get to see even more.

3231
01:26:16,701 --> 01:26:21,340
So why he's such a pain in the ass ass
in capital letters and the truth and that

3232
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,720
the truth is really stranger than fiction.

3233
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:24,441
Dot Dot.

3234
01:26:24,441 --> 01:26:25,274
Dot.

3235
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,720
He typed out the email,

3236
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:27,381
his laptop,

3237
01:26:27,381 --> 01:26:31,310
crossed out his name and email address
and then turned it into a jpeg and send

3238
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:32,510
it to me in a blank.

3239
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,230
Email.

3240
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,490
Blank is in capital letters,

3241
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:38,150
blank email as if there's
such a thing as a blank email.

3242
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:39,920
You told me that as a jpeg in it.

3243
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:40,251
Let's just,

3244
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:41,084
not blank.

3245
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:42,111
I was like,

3246
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:43,100
what the fuck bro?

3247
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:47,030
And then he told me he didn't want to
send it as an email because someone might

3248
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:50,120
intercept it really in capital letters.

3249
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:50,930
Trust me,

3250
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:52,070
he's worth the hassle.

3251
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:53,540
But he's full on looney tunes.

3252
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:59,320
He tried to determine what
the chain pag email do you do.

3253
01:26:59,321 --> 01:27:00,250
You know how,

3254
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,080
how ridiculous that is.

3255
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:03,091
Ridiculous.

3256
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:07,840
Just just getting caught like that and
then claiming that that's what happened

3257
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:10,810
is one of the nuttiest fucking
things I've ever heard in my life

3258
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,230
and the fact that he like
put it out as a draft,

3259
01:27:14,231 --> 01:27:16,450
like it's almost like
with people like that,

3260
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:21,160
that that to strategize how to rip people
off and strategize how to do shit like

3261
01:27:21,161 --> 01:27:21,670
that.

3262
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:24,040
It's almost like they want to get busted.

3263
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:28,840
It's almost like they feel bad doing
that when when it comes to something like

3264
01:27:28,841 --> 01:27:29,171
that,

3265
01:27:29,171 --> 01:27:30,004
like,

3266
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,430
like pretending that a
guy that does it probably,

3267
01:27:33,431 --> 01:27:34,480
I don't even know what the guy exists,

3268
01:27:34,481 --> 01:27:38,700
but the guy definitely didn't write him
that email to pretending that someone's

3269
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:40,850
writing you an email and if you read the,

3270
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:41,190
the,

3271
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:43,660
the email is hilarious man.

3272
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:45,490
No bullshit attendees,

3273
01:27:45,491 --> 01:27:46,360
all capital letters.

3274
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:47,120
So the guy,

3275
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,350
the email is in the exact
same style of writing.

3276
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,221
It's like,

3277
01:27:51,221 --> 01:27:54,490
it's a really specific style of writing
that I guess he doesn't realize.

3278
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:56,620
He doesn't realize how specific
the way he communicates.

3279
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:58,420
Like if I got an email from you,

3280
01:27:58,630 --> 01:27:58,871
I,

3281
01:27:58,871 --> 01:28:00,220
you know you have a style of,

3282
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:01,270
of talking and writing.

3283
01:28:01,390 --> 01:28:02,920
Whereas if I get an email from my lawyer,

3284
01:28:02,921 --> 01:28:04,510
it's a different kind of style.

3285
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:09,870
This is his all caps thing
for like emphasizing oh caps,

3286
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:12,040
no bullshit attendees.

3287
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:12,940
Seriously.

3288
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:17,940
If these guys aren't real players who
aren't willing to push an all their chips

3289
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:21,850
to the center of the table,

3290
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:23,110
don't waste my time.

3291
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:23,950
Like,

3292
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:25,420
and this is Mr crazy pants.

3293
01:28:25,421 --> 01:28:26,500
This is mister x.

3294
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:30,580
Like he can't even tell
you like who this guy is,

3295
01:28:30,581 --> 01:28:32,170
what his qualifications are.

3296
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:33,220
It's not telling you anything.

3297
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:34,450
The guys a rec clues.

3298
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,810
He said genius and he's
responsible for all my success.

3299
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,750
And if it's any one man that
I'm jealous of in his life,

3300
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,693
it's him.

3301
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:42,940
Whoa.

3302
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,170
It's so ridiculous.

3303
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:46,360
What the fuck man?

3304
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,523
You know

3305
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,090
how is looking at that broken toe?

3306
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:51,471
Oh,

3307
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:52,660
the Jon Jones broken toe.

3308
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:53,090
Yeah.

3309
01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:54,410
That was a crazy situation.

3310
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:56,743
It was not good.

3311
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,100
Is He?

3312
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:02,030
So did he break it like near
the end of the fight or he is,

3313
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,840
we think we're not sure.

3314
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:05,850
We only isolated when it turned over.

3315
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:09,000
We isolated at one point in
the video it turned over.

3316
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:09,750
Um,

3317
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:13,440
but we did not isolate the exact break.

3318
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:18,450
We have like a theory as to what happened
and it seems like he was ground and

3319
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:23,451
pounding on Chael Sonnen and he was just
doing it so ruthlessly and ridiculously

3320
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:26,430
that he's just pushing his
foot off of the canvas,

3321
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:27,990
snapped his toe backwards.

3322
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:29,063
Yeah.

3323
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:29,791
Yeah.

3324
01:29:29,791 --> 01:29:30,870
Well when you think about it,

3325
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:31,111
man,

3326
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:34,590
it's amazing that we don't have more
tau injuries cause Tosa is little tiny

3327
01:29:34,591 --> 01:29:36,780
things and they're getting
involved in a fucking street fight,

3328
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,740
you know,

3329
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:41,970
kicking elbows and fucking
skulls and stomachs and you know,

3330
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,380
catching shins.

3331
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,480
It's like the idea that,

3332
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:47,250
that this is the only
time this has happened.

3333
01:29:47,251 --> 01:29:48,240
It's actually kind of shocking.

3334
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:50,010
I protect my piggies should,

3335
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:50,910
it's a good move,

3336
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:53,170
but you can't fight with
shoes on because you know the,

3337
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,850
the texture of the shoe
would cut your face going.

3338
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:56,320
You're right.

3339
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,170
I think you'd deal with
a lot of Abrasiveness,

3340
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:58,890
you know,

3341
01:29:58,890 --> 01:29:59,790
I don't think you could really,

3342
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,130
I think barefoot is on
the only the way to go.

3343
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,380
They could go with shinon instead paths,

3344
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:05,670
but that doesn't protect your toes.

3345
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:06,990
You know,

3346
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,280
your toes are what they are.

3347
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:09,323
They're weak,

3348
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:09,841
you know?

3349
01:30:09,841 --> 01:30:12,930
And he snapped his toe
backward and it was nasty.

3350
01:30:12,931 --> 01:30:15,570
So I'm interviewing him
and I'm congratulating him.

3351
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,580
They put his belt on them
and no one even knows it yet.

3352
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:18,443
He doesn't even know it.

3353
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,500
And then he looks down.

3354
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:20,101
So he's like,

3355
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:20,920
stands on a man.

3356
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:21,200
It's like,

3357
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:21,720
look down,

3358
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,431
it feels blood.

3359
01:30:22,431 --> 01:30:23,040
He goes,

3360
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,210
all my God,

3361
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:25,050
my toe,

3362
01:30:25,051 --> 01:30:26,490
like he like he meet,

3363
01:30:26,491 --> 01:30:27,570
he immediately like,

3364
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:28,080
it was like,

3365
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:28,960
oh my God.

3366
01:30:28,961 --> 01:30:30,000
Like his toe was nasty.

3367
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:30,241
I go,

3368
01:30:30,241 --> 01:30:30,501
oh,

3369
01:30:30,501 --> 01:30:31,160
okay.

3370
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:31,890
All right.

3371
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:32,281
So,

3372
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:33,060
um,

3373
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:33,870
nobody did anything.

3374
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:34,260
That was what?

3375
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,010
It was crazy.

3376
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:36,750
No one was even anywhere near him.

3377
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:37,681
Like I'm like,

3378
01:30:37,681 --> 01:30:38,850
this guy's got a broken toe.

3379
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:39,960
So I have to,

3380
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:42,870
because it's kind of an
awkward time for the doctors.

3381
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:44,400
Like they don't know when to run in.

3382
01:30:44,401 --> 01:30:47,940
I get is the broadcast is going on and
obviously I'm talking on camera so they

3383
01:30:47,941 --> 01:30:49,290
don't want to like interrupt.

3384
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:50,550
So nobody did anything.

3385
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:54,330
So I kind of realized that since I'm the
one with the microphone and I'm talking

3386
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:54,780
to him,

3387
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,650
I got to do everything.

3388
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:56,431
So I said,

3389
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:56,940
hold on,

3390
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:57,721
let me get him a chair.

3391
01:30:57,721 --> 01:30:59,190
I've got a chair and
I call for the doctor,

3392
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,001
we get a doctor in here,

3393
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:00,630
please.

3394
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:01,950
And then the doctor run it in.

3395
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,800
That's the only time I've ever had
a call for a doctor in a post fight

3396
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:05,410
interview.

3397
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:06,870
How did not see that?

3398
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:07,940
He's such a trooper dude.

3399
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:08,081
He,

3400
01:31:08,081 --> 01:31:08,420
he,

3401
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:09,231
he wanted to continue.

3402
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:09,391
I'm like,

3403
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:10,141
do you want to keep talking?

3404
01:31:10,141 --> 01:31:10,891
We don't have to do this.

3405
01:31:10,891 --> 01:31:11,161
And he's like,

3406
01:31:11,161 --> 01:31:11,281
no,

3407
01:31:11,281 --> 01:31:11,341
no,

3408
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:11,461
no,

3409
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:12,120
I'm cool.

3410
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:12,541
I'm cool.

3411
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:13,150
So I'm going.

3412
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:13,980
So I said,

3413
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:14,191
you know,

3414
01:31:14,191 --> 01:31:14,761
tell me,

3415
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:15,511
what was it like,

3416
01:31:15,511 --> 01:31:15,680
you know,

3417
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,280
was it like all the trash talking to get,

3418
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:17,760
you know,

3419
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,170
I don't remember even
what my questions were,

3420
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,240
but when it was over,

3421
01:31:21,241 --> 01:31:21,690
um,

3422
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:21,960
you know,

3423
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:22,351
he,

3424
01:31:22,351 --> 01:31:22,590
uh,

3425
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:23,970
he actually was holding,

3426
01:31:23,971 --> 01:31:26,340
his foot has one foot and
dancing for the crowd.

3427
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:31,080
Like his toe was broken and he was holding
one foot and on his left leg he was

3428
01:31:31,081 --> 01:31:32,610
hopping around dancing for the crowd.

3429
01:31:32,611 --> 01:31:33,780
They were laughing and cheering.

3430
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:35,520
Yeah.

3431
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,680
It's toe got snapped and
he was laughing about it.

3432
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:38,520
He didn't even care.

3433
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,310
Then he ate a pizza.

3434
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:40,290
You had a giant pizza,

3435
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:44,160
sat down with this big ass pepperoni
pizza cause you know he has to cut weight

3436
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:48,000
and then he went to the press conference
and then he went to the hospital after

3437
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:48,510
all that.

3438
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:48,990
Yeah,

3439
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:50,250
they kind of stabilized foot.

3440
01:31:50,251 --> 01:31:51,210
They put it in a brace.

3441
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,350
But um,

3442
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:52,861
apparently,

3443
01:31:52,861 --> 01:31:53,191
you know,

3444
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:54,024
it's broken toe.

3445
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:55,350
It's one of those things that happens,

3446
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:56,041
you know,

3447
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:56,641
no one,

3448
01:31:56,641 --> 01:31:58,470
I'm no one uh,

3449
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:00,100
Nu uh,

3450
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:01,773
I think it's,

3451
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,030
there's,

3452
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,310
there's,

3453
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:03,560
there's,

3454
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,460
I think there's a theory that
you have to get like a broke,

3455
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,700
a break taken care of
within an eight hour window.

3456
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:10,310
Yeah.

3457
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:12,370
So there was some criticism of that.

3458
01:32:12,371 --> 01:32:15,370
Like whether or not he should have been
allowed to eat that pizza because if he

3459
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:16,210
ate that pizza,

3460
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,160
what if he goes and into,

3461
01:32:18,161 --> 01:32:18,610
um,

3462
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:19,930
you need 10 hours?

3463
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:23,140
I think from the time you eat
till they let you go under

3464
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,890
oh gas.

3465
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,870
But I don't know if they had
to go and aesthetic with them.

3466
01:32:27,871 --> 01:32:31,650
I think that could probably go local
unless they need to do a real serious

3467
01:32:31,651 --> 01:32:32,670
ligament surgery.

3468
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:34,140
I think they just went local.

3469
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:35,670
I don't think they need to put you out.

3470
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:35,881
Right.

3471
01:32:35,881 --> 01:32:40,520
But that's a good point because if you
eat and then you go and get anesthesia,

3472
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:41,370
you could fucking,

3473
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:44,040
you could throw up in your mouth like
you gotta have like a real issues.

3474
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,273
Yeah.

3475
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:46,870
Anesthesia is a weird thing,

3476
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:47,140
man.

3477
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:47,681
It's scary,

3478
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:48,514
man.

3479
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:53,770
I've only done it I think once where
they tell you to count backwards or

3480
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:55,630
whatever and then you
wake up and you're like,

3481
01:32:55,631 --> 01:32:56,680
where the fuck am I?

3482
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:57,580
Like time?

3483
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,170
Just that's time travel right there.

3484
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,050
Don was my nose.

3485
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:02,610
It's weird,

3486
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:03,990
but they're so good at it now.

3487
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:04,800
You know?

3488
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,000
They know what the fuck to do.

3489
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:06,420
It's a,

3490
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:06,721
it's,

3491
01:33:06,721 --> 01:33:07,590
it's pretty incredible.

3492
01:33:07,591 --> 01:33:10,170
They can pop you under and cut you open.

3493
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:10,861
You know?

3494
01:33:10,861 --> 01:33:12,990
They had to figure that
out back in the old days.

3495
01:33:12,991 --> 01:33:13,191
Dude,

3496
01:33:13,191 --> 01:33:16,210
they just gave you a piece of
wood when you bite down on it,

3497
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,180
scream as they saw your leg off.

3498
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:19,880
Okay.

3499
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,860
Do you imagine having to do,

3500
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:24,370
could you imagine dentists are this,

3501
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:29,090
that the last one to like figure
shit out like Dennis Dennis,

3502
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:33,110
cause they still have to do pretty
some pretty gnarly shit to you.

3503
01:33:33,111 --> 01:33:38,111
You know like grinding teeth down and
pulling teeth is what other options,

3504
01:33:38,451 --> 01:33:38,840
you know,

3505
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:42,670
tooth teeth are the hard things
fucking off the eight years or so.

3506
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:44,930
Well guys would get like fake teeth.

3507
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,940
That's what's really crazy
that they can do that now.

3508
01:33:46,941 --> 01:33:47,690
Perfect.

3509
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:48,740
They're like screw into your,

3510
01:33:48,741 --> 01:33:51,290
you have a fake screwing your channel Rod.

3511
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:53,370
I have a Rod Rooney your mind,

3512
01:33:53,371 --> 01:33:55,280
your head Gaul and uh,

3513
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:58,340
yeah and you know what they're doing in
Japan is that they're shaving them down

3514
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:00,680
into like these like
little teeny fangs now.

3515
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:03,260
They were doing that for a while.

3516
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:03,411
Yeah,

3517
01:34:03,411 --> 01:34:04,071
they've been doing it for a while,

3518
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:06,530
but I guess it's coming back
like cat teeth or whatever it is.

3519
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:07,820
A Japanese people.

3520
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:08,121
Well,

3521
01:34:08,121 --> 01:34:10,850
the good news is you could always get
caps if you decided to be a responsible

3522
01:34:10,851 --> 01:34:11,250
citizen.

3523
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,140
Ways get the,

3524
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:15,650
but that captures fucked up cause they
have to grind the surface or your real

3525
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,700
teeth out all of them.

3526
01:34:16,701 --> 01:34:17,271
So yeah,

3527
01:34:17,271 --> 01:34:18,080
so that's a wrap.

3528
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:21,350
You're not no more real teeth for the
rest of your life and they don't stay on

3529
01:34:21,351 --> 01:34:21,710
that.

3530
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:25,910
Like I know this guy that was talking the
other day and they just fell out like,

3531
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:27,380
oh yeah,

3532
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:31,370
he was just eating noodles and it just
fell out of Diego Sanchez and Carl Breezy

3533
01:34:31,371 --> 01:34:35,360
and font and Diego Sanchez hit carp reason
I believe he hit him with a knee and

3534
01:34:35,361 --> 01:34:36,520
his veneer went flying.

3535
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:38,570
Yeah,

3536
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:39,351
it was nuts,

3537
01:34:39,351 --> 01:34:39,860
man.

3538
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:43,400
We thought it was a tooth and we thought
a tooth came out of his mouth and went

3539
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:44,253
flying.

3540
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:49,080
That was a Diego Sanchez in his
heyday would swarm motherfuckers.

3541
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:50,001
He just,

3542
01:34:50,001 --> 01:34:52,760
he had such tenacity and crazy cardio.

3543
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:54,570
He was like the first guy that did that.

3544
01:34:54,571 --> 01:34:57,040
The Carl caught him with a big names.

3545
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:58,180
We

3546
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,620
thought it was a tooth and went flying.

3547
01:34:59,621 --> 01:35:00,161
I was robbing the,

3548
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:01,240
highlighted it on the,

3549
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:02,410
on the slow Mo,

3550
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:03,513
you know?

3551
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:05,380
Yeah.

3552
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:08,230
That whole caps thing.

3553
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:11,320
That's a weird day to not
have your real teeth anymore.

3554
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:15,730
Just have this like I'm always
worried this society is going to fail.

3555
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,630
I'm always worried and if
I had a mouth fuck caps,

3556
01:35:18,631 --> 01:35:18,851
I'm like,

3557
01:35:18,851 --> 01:35:19,341
God damn,

3558
01:35:19,341 --> 01:35:20,950
I got to keep these fucking cabs with me.

3559
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:24,880
[inaudible] fails and we have no more
dentists and we're all going mad max

3560
01:35:24,881 --> 01:35:25,600
style.

3561
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,050
Yeah.

3562
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:26,883
My two front teeth,

3563
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:30,820
my one of my teeth is only a temporary
that I've had since I was like sixth

3564
01:35:30,821 --> 01:35:31,990
grade or something like that.

3565
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:32,531
Yeah.

3566
01:35:32,531 --> 01:35:32,861
I'm not,

3567
01:35:32,861 --> 01:35:33,820
I'm supposed to get rid of it,

3568
01:35:33,821 --> 01:35:35,860
but well your whole face is temporary.

3569
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:36,550
Really.

3570
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:37,590
How long is that going to last?

3571
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:38,330
You know?

3572
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:39,250
Fuck everybody.

3573
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:39,611
You know,

3574
01:35:39,611 --> 01:35:41,500
we got like a hundred
years on this planet,

3575
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:42,080
the whole thing.

3576
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,913
Everything's temporary.

3577
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,220
If you've added since sixth grade,

3578
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:47,140
it should be like a contest feel.

3579
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:47,810
Let's see how long.

3580
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:48,300
I know.

3581
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,330
It just might as well keep it.

3582
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:50,050
Yeah,

3583
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:50,770
why not?

3584
01:35:50,770 --> 01:35:51,603
Are you happy with it?

3585
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:52,420
No.

3586
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:53,330
I went to,

3587
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,750
I do want to get veneers,

3588
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:55,720
but it's so expensive.

3589
01:35:55,721 --> 01:35:56,231
How does it work?

3590
01:35:56,231 --> 01:35:56,830
Good.

3591
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:57,850
Finnair's no,

3592
01:35:57,851 --> 01:35:58,490
this is what was your,

3593
01:35:58,490 --> 01:35:59,290
your fake tooth?

3594
01:35:59,290 --> 01:35:59,711
Yeah.

3595
01:35:59,711 --> 01:36:02,520
I'm not supposed to eat things like
apples and just the cut up apple.

3596
01:36:02,521 --> 01:36:05,080
It's like a little baby
and things like that.

3597
01:36:05,081 --> 01:36:06,160
I'm supposed to not eat,

3598
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:09,790
but it's more just the staining issue
of drinking coffee every day and

3599
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:10,261
cigarettes.

3600
01:36:10,261 --> 01:36:10,890
So it's,

3601
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,900
it's probably so you want to get
veneers so that you could ruin,

3602
01:36:13,930 --> 01:36:17,140
ruin them to know so I can
have it like replace them.

3603
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,060
So you want to have like all shiny teeth.

3604
01:36:19,061 --> 01:36:19,291
You want to,

3605
01:36:19,291 --> 01:36:20,320
I don't want you to model.

3606
01:36:20,350 --> 01:36:20,591
No,

3607
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:21,131
I don't want that.

3608
01:36:21,131 --> 01:36:21,311
Like,

3609
01:36:21,311 --> 01:36:21,581
Hey,

3610
01:36:21,581 --> 01:36:22,414
I got white teeth.

3611
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:23,530
Teague's yeah,

3612
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:25,860
cause how you picture yourself in that,

3613
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:26,710
that bikini.

3614
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:26,891
No,

3615
01:36:26,891 --> 01:36:28,540
I just want to have like normal teeth.

3616
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:29,520
Farrah Fawcett.

3617
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,353
How about that?

3618
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:31,030
Fair fossil,

3619
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:31,710
that poster,

3620
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:32,460
the big smile.

3621
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:37,460
She dead rest in peace teeth upright now.

3622
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:39,930
But back in the day she
had this big giant smile,

3623
01:36:39,931 --> 01:36:40,290
that fair

3624
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:41,080
Fawcett poster.

3625
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,390
You have the Farrah Fawcett poster.

3626
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:42,661
Yeah.

3627
01:36:42,661 --> 01:36:44,030
I can't believe the classic iconic,

3628
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,080
fair Fawcett her.

3629
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:45,831
Yeah,

3630
01:36:45,831 --> 01:36:46,190
that's,

3631
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:47,023
you know,

3632
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:47,923
that's not good.

3633
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,153
She got cancer.

3634
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:50,780
That's Sachs does suck.

3635
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:51,930
So that's hard.

3636
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:54,040
I was looking at Pam Anderson's
Twitter the other day.

3637
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:54,730
That's another one.

3638
01:36:54,730 --> 01:36:55,910
I just don't,

3639
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,840
this is a weird thing that happens with,

3640
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:00,320
uh,

3641
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,430
some women is that they go from
being hot to being a monster.

3642
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:06,440
It's really weird.

3643
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:11,710
It's really weird the way they go
from being like really hot to almost

3644
01:37:12,021 --> 01:37:12,950
repulsive.

3645
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,300
You know,

3646
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:19,300
this like weird clinging on to like youth.

3647
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:21,290
You remember we had the Angelina,

3648
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:22,230
Angelina,

3649
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:24,650
remember we were talking about
that and one of the reason podcast,

3650
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:27,830
that woman who had billboards in La.

3651
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:28,330
Yeah.

3652
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:31,270
And what's weird is when we
talked about her the other day,

3653
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:35,650
my friend had texted me that she
face planted and he filmed it.

3654
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:36,360
Oh No.

3655
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:38,420
And it was this right when
we were talking about it.

3656
01:37:38,421 --> 01:37:39,060
It happened.

3657
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,150
That's so sad.

3658
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:41,093
But

3659
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:45,540
it is about TMZ.

3660
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:46,480
She may TMZ though.

3661
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:47,561
Hello.

3662
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:48,394
Beautiful.

3663
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,351
Oh my God,

3664
01:37:50,351 --> 01:37:50,531
he's here.

3665
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,720
We're asking her how are you?

3666
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:53,331
Look,

3667
01:37:53,331 --> 01:37:54,164
see how she covers.

3668
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:55,883
Oh,

3669
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:57,663
you okay?

3670
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:00,740
Oh my God.

3671
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:02,933
Okay.

3672
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:03,893
Okay.

3673
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:07,083
Damn,

3674
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:08,600
that sucks.

3675
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,433
Yeah,

3676
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:12,080
she seems Nice.

3677
01:38:12,081 --> 01:38:13,450
Your fault was it probably was hurt.

3678
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:14,713
His fault.

3679
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:15,633
She's paranoid,

3680
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,480
she's getting out of their cars.

3681
01:38:17,481 --> 01:38:20,570
Guys got a camera in her face is
freaking out and says high curbs.

3682
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:22,790
This high curbs should be,

3683
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:25,130
you should probably pay attention
to where you're walking.

3684
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:28,370
But she's not paying attention cause
she's got a camera in her face and she's

3685
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:29,300
probably all weirded out.

3686
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:29,690
Right.

3687
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:30,381
Some guys going,

3688
01:38:30,381 --> 01:38:31,040
hey beautiful.

3689
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,860
By the way,

3690
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,170
if they don't identify themselves,

3691
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:33,681
they don't say,

3692
01:38:33,681 --> 01:38:33,951
Hey,

3693
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:35,090
I'm from TMZ.

3694
01:38:35,091 --> 01:38:36,440
They just stick a camera in your face.

3695
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:37,011
You know?

3696
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:39,170
And if you're sticking a camera
in an old lady's face like that,

3697
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:40,550
she's a little weirded out by it.

3698
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:41,270
Yeah.

3699
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:42,230
She walks around with that,

3700
01:38:42,231 --> 01:38:44,360
that fan in front of
her face I should say.

3701
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,360
Do eventually identify themselves.

3702
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:46,630
Yeah,

3703
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:48,400
but not before the cameras already on,

3704
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:49,773
you know,

3705
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,800
I fucked up my car one of
those curves the other day.

3706
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:52,150
Those are,

3707
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:53,300
there's not like the double curbs,

3708
01:38:53,301 --> 01:38:53,661
you know,

3709
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:56,470
I don't know if you've seen where it's
like normal curve and then there's like

3710
01:38:56,471 --> 01:38:57,470
the really high ones.

3711
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,550
So if you open your door,

3712
01:38:58,610 --> 01:38:59,120
yeah.

3713
01:38:59,120 --> 01:38:59,960
And that's exactly what it is.

3714
01:38:59,961 --> 01:39:02,180
Like somebody opened up my door,

3715
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:03,170
I'm like,

3716
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:04,490
what the fuck is that about?

3717
01:39:04,491 --> 01:39:05,500
Why is that even allowed?

3718
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:06,490
That should be illegal.

3719
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,360
The state should pay for that.

3720
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,830
I wonder if it has anything to do with
like areas where they need to drain more

3721
01:39:11,831 --> 01:39:12,610
water.

3722
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:13,443
Maybe,

3723
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:14,380
you know,

3724
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:16,060
or areas where that could
be like a real issue.

3725
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:16,900
Right.

3726
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,190
Most likely that's what it is.

3727
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:19,540
Right?

3728
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:21,810
You've got to make sure you don't hang
out with dumb people that just opened

3729
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:22,644
doors like that.

3730
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:23,570
Right.

3731
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:23,800
Like,

3732
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:24,633
you know,

3733
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:27,700
dumb people just open your doors
slamming in the trees and shit.

3734
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:27,941
Oh,

3735
01:39:27,941 --> 01:39:29,110
sorry dude.

3736
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:29,740
Right.

3737
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:31,030
Woopsies

3738
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,310
did you talk about hate did at t here?

3739
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:35,243
Oop,

3740
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,850
I think there'll be did it on purpose.

3741
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:38,651
I think he did it.

3742
01:39:38,651 --> 01:39:39,760
So you'd have something to talk about.

3743
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:41,890
We'll just talk about it on the podcast.

3744
01:39:41,891 --> 01:39:42,640
But he did,

3745
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,060
uh,

3746
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,950
no thing just really opened up.

3747
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,730
There was a card that was picking on me,

3748
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:47,261
open it up,

3749
01:39:47,261 --> 01:39:49,350
and it dinged my door at Greeley hat by,

3750
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,250
luckily it was like the day before you're,

3751
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:52,453
my lease was up,

3752
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:54,820
so I really didn't care.

3753
01:39:54,821 --> 01:39:55,061
I was like,

3754
01:39:55,061 --> 01:39:55,691
it's no big deal.

3755
01:39:55,691 --> 01:39:56,524
I got to bring it back.

3756
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:57,851
It wasn't even,

3757
01:39:57,851 --> 01:39:58,541
he didn't even dig.

3758
01:39:58,541 --> 01:39:58,931
It just,

3759
01:39:58,931 --> 01:40:01,400
it seemed like it should have
like made a loud noise funk,

3760
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:02,680
but it really didn't even leave a mark.

3761
01:40:02,890 --> 01:40:03,723
But you know,

3762
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,500
I guess he talked about it on the radio.

3763
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:06,260
Oh yeah,

3764
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:07,093
yeah,

3765
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:08,381
yeah.

3766
01:40:08,381 --> 01:40:10,990
I didn't get a chance to go
there this time I was in Jersey.

3767
01:40:10,991 --> 01:40:13,930
I was staying in New Brunswick because
it's too fucking far too much shit I had

3768
01:40:13,931 --> 01:40:14,764
to do while I was there.

3769
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,261
I didn't,

3770
01:40:15,261 --> 01:40:16,480
I didn't get a chance to own a,

3771
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,400
I gotta wake up and call them more often.

3772
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:19,201
All right.

3773
01:40:19,201 --> 01:40:20,040
Just go to bed late.

3774
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:22,560
I always look at the
beginning part of the show,

3775
01:40:22,561 --> 01:40:25,530
like it's always Joey Diaz tweeting
like about to go live and I'm like,

3776
01:40:25,531 --> 01:40:26,220
I'm in bed.

3777
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:26,761
How's it going,

3778
01:40:26,761 --> 01:40:27,594
Joanne tonight.

3779
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:28,530
Oh Joey.

3780
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:30,660
When he's doing as a church
of what's happening now.

3781
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:31,573
Yeah.

3782
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,050
You

3783
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:32,441
know what?

3784
01:40:32,441 --> 01:40:35,200
When people have radios in their cars,

3785
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:37,960
that's going to be the number one
drive time show in the country.

3786
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,600
When people have radios in their
cars that can play Internet,

3787
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,370
which a lot of people do now,

3788
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:45,160
but it's not quite 100%.

3789
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:46,000
You know,

3790
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:46,691
it's not quite,

3791
01:40:46,691 --> 01:40:47,710
you can get stitcher,

3792
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:48,881
stitcher,

3793
01:40:48,881 --> 01:40:51,370
you can get in a lot of
Ford cars and you know,

3794
01:40:51,371 --> 01:40:52,151
a lot of cars,

3795
01:40:52,151 --> 01:40:54,120
a our Bluetooth sinked up to

3796
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:57,670
iPhones and there's applications
that allow you to listen to podcasts,

3797
01:40:57,671 --> 01:40:59,440
like the podcast app on Itunes,

3798
01:40:59,441 --> 01:41:00,430
which is amazing.

3799
01:41:00,431 --> 01:41:01,264
I love that.

3800
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,031
That's where I,

3801
01:41:02,031 --> 01:41:02,150
uh,

3802
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:03,880
I get all my podcasts,

3803
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:04,714
I listened to him,

3804
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,540
but eventually it's going
to be even easier than that.

3805
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:09,660
So you could stream live and when it got,

3806
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:12,620
if a guy like Joey could do like a,

3807
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:15,550
an internet morning
show and stream it live,

3808
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:17,620
just get them every day from,

3809
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:17,921
you know,

3810
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:18,970
six to nine.

3811
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:21,700
He was doing something
about the national anthem.

3812
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:22,600
Didn't we play it?

3813
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:23,710
We played it.

3814
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:24,040
Yeah.

3815
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:24,610
Yeah.

3816
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:25,443
Come on man.

3817
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:28,300
That's funny than anything you've
ever heard in any fucking mornings.

3818
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:29,134
Who ever,

3819
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:29,461
well,

3820
01:41:29,461 --> 01:41:30,300
I don't know if you stand up,

3821
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:31,423
get up,

3822
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:32,813
get up.

3823
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:33,600
Uh,

3824
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,490
Volkswagen just announced their new,

3825
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:36,240
uh,

3826
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,060
crazy,

3827
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:37,460
uh,

3828
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:38,250
I beetle.

3829
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:39,240
I don't know if he even heard this.

3830
01:41:39,241 --> 01:41:44,241
It's a doc and an APP for your iPhone
five Oh like right there and it integrates

3831
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:49,320
in with your iPhone so you can just sit
there and use your radio and like access

3832
01:41:49,321 --> 01:41:52,560
things like Spotify and stitcher and,

3833
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,110
and you know you're going to be able
to do whatever pretty much whatever you

3834
01:41:55,111 --> 01:41:55,860
want to.

3835
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:56,311
But it's,

3836
01:41:56,311 --> 01:41:56,610
it's,

3837
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:59,070
it's coming out in the next month
or a couple of months I believe.

3838
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:03,900
And it's like the first time that there
is actually a car that I think has maybe

3839
01:42:03,901 --> 01:42:05,190
worked with apple because they,

3840
01:42:05,191 --> 01:42:07,760
they're using some kind of
software that integrates with,

3841
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,120
I'm not 100% sure about it,

3842
01:42:09,121 --> 01:42:10,620
but the people are making it seem like,

3843
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:11,370
like they were,

3844
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:14,550
there was actually some
kind of three pedal car.

3845
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:17,043
That's my car

3846
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:17,630
though.

3847
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:17,871
Yeah.

3848
01:42:17,871 --> 01:42:18,980
Go back to that though.

3849
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:21,470
Is that a manual transmission?

3850
01:42:21,471 --> 01:42:23,690
Did they still make these things
with manual transmissions?

3851
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:24,130
The beetle?

3852
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:24,710
Oh yeah.

3853
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:25,341
There's manual.

3854
01:42:25,341 --> 01:42:27,410
There's also been that
one that you saw there.

3855
01:42:27,411 --> 01:42:29,570
The iPhone five one is that
it's not a stick shift.

3856
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:29,691
Yeah.

3857
01:42:29,691 --> 01:42:30,524
That's a stick shift.

3858
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:31,590
Yeah.

3859
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:35,870
I can't believe they even advertise that
I thought looked like smooth most small

3860
01:42:35,871 --> 01:42:36,704
car companies.

3861
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:38,030
I thought they were done with that.

3862
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:38,380
Oh,

3863
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,330
mine's a turbo.

3864
01:42:39,331 --> 01:42:39,751
And the,

3865
01:42:39,751 --> 01:42:41,340
actually they have a diesel turbo now,

3866
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:43,590
but it's also got the paddle shifters.

3867
01:42:43,591 --> 01:42:44,424
But this is,

3868
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:44,890
yeah,

3869
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:45,551
paddle shifters.

3870
01:42:45,551 --> 01:42:46,570
It means it's an automatic,

3871
01:42:46,571 --> 01:42:47,141
that's what I'm saying.

3872
01:42:47,141 --> 01:42:48,610
Like the clutch lists,

3873
01:42:48,611 --> 01:42:49,000
uh,

3874
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,100
these dual clutch boxes where you don't,

3875
01:42:51,101 --> 01:42:53,410
I mean I'd been clutchless like
you don't press it yourself.

3876
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:54,573
Automatic Clutch.

3877
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:55,940
They still say you saved money.

3878
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:56,691
It's just an La,

3879
01:42:56,691 --> 01:42:58,610
you don't see it that much
because I think you do.

3880
01:42:58,860 --> 01:42:59,571
I look gas.

3881
01:42:59,571 --> 01:43:00,320
I think you're supposed to.

3882
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:00,891
That's what I mean.

3883
01:43:00,891 --> 01:43:01,461
I'm gas.

3884
01:43:01,461 --> 01:43:02,510
I don't think you do anymore.

3885
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:03,170
Oh really?

3886
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:03,321
Yeah.

3887
01:43:03,321 --> 01:43:03,621
I don't,

3888
01:43:03,621 --> 01:43:05,360
I don't think it's more efficient anymore.

3889
01:43:05,361 --> 01:43:07,040
I think the manual is less efficient

3890
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:07,940
no more.

3891
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:08,361
I'm sorry.

3892
01:43:08,361 --> 01:43:09,500
More it costs less.

3893
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:09,911
Oh,

3894
01:43:09,911 --> 01:43:10,480
to buy it.

3895
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:10,900
Yeah.

3896
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:11,231
Oh yeah,

3897
01:43:11,231 --> 01:43:11,870
definitely.

3898
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:12,110
It's like,

3899
01:43:12,110 --> 01:43:12,943
it makes sense.

3900
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:13,940
Yeah,

3901
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:14,520
usually.

3902
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:14,740
Yeah.

3903
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:15,850
Automatic transmission.

3904
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,560
For a long time it was like a big,

3905
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:18,573
a big amount.

3906
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,840
But I remember when I was a kid,

3907
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:21,430
like everybody wanted automatics.

3908
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:22,630
Like it was like a big deal.

3909
01:43:22,631 --> 01:43:23,464
Like we had a muscle car.

3910
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:24,580
You want her to get an automatic,

3911
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,260
I have no idea why now.

3912
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:30,450
Like I had a muscle car that was an
automatic and it was like so annoying to

3913
01:43:30,451 --> 01:43:31,284
just,

3914
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:32,763
it just,

3915
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,050
it's doing the shifting for you.

3916
01:43:35,230 --> 01:43:37,420
Like if you're going to drive
one of the stupid old cars,

3917
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,340
you should be doing all
that stupid old shit.

3918
01:43:39,341 --> 01:43:40,720
Like shifting your own gears.

3919
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:41,823
You know,

3920
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:43,720
you should probably roll
down your own windows too.

3921
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:45,670
Yeah.

3922
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:46,503
My friend took windows,

3923
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:49,960
like self parking cars the
other day and it crashed.

3924
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,100
No.

3925
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:52,190
Yeah,

3926
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,030
it just started like,

3927
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:56,030
I just like ran right into the
car that it was trying to park.

3928
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,670
Oh no it was it Alexis.

3929
01:43:58,690 --> 01:43:58,950
Who,

3930
01:43:58,950 --> 01:43:59,081
no,

3931
01:43:59,081 --> 01:43:59,914
I don't want to

3932
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:03,910
that Lexus is a fucking,

3933
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:05,290
that was the first one that invented it.

3934
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:07,450
That is a smooth ride.

3935
01:44:07,451 --> 01:44:11,770
If you ever want like a
sort of low key luxury car,

3936
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:16,190
like it's not as in your face
is like a Mercedes or is is uh,

3937
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:19,000
as flashy as a Bentley
or something like that.

3938
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:20,560
But you're inside that car,

3939
01:44:20,890 --> 01:44:22,680
you don't hear shit they had,

3940
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:25,570
it was one of the most
comfortable fucking cars.

3941
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:30,550
Lexus knows how to make like
this weird sort of environment,

3942
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:33,010
this weird like soft,

3943
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:35,200
calm environment like that.

3944
01:44:35,201 --> 01:44:36,640
Carl calm you down.

3945
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,411
You ever be in a,

3946
01:44:38,411 --> 01:44:40,930
you ever been in like a
really expensive luxury car?

3947
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,793
Just yours.

3948
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,150
That old BMW?

3949
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,641
Yeah.

3950
01:44:43,641 --> 01:44:44,830
I don't even require those anymore.

3951
01:44:44,910 --> 01:44:45,061
Yeah,

3952
01:44:45,061 --> 01:44:45,560
but they're,

3953
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:46,121
they're not,

3954
01:44:46,121 --> 01:44:47,470
I don't have any luxury cars anymore.

3955
01:44:47,530 --> 01:44:48,363
That's true.

3956
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:49,570
Luxury cars are weird.

3957
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:53,200
Like the calm you down and this troubled,

3958
01:44:53,290 --> 01:44:54,150
I was Lexuses.

3959
01:44:54,630 --> 01:44:55,480
It's the ridiculous,

3960
01:44:56,170 --> 01:44:57,003
you don't feel anything.

3961
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:57,971
Everything you go over,

3962
01:44:57,971 --> 01:44:58,870
it's like you're on a boat.

3963
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:03,040
Like you don't feel bumps and shit.

3964
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:03,600
It's like,

3965
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,410
it figures out a way to
smooth everything out.

3966
01:45:05,890 --> 01:45:06,281
You know,

3967
01:45:06,281 --> 01:45:11,281
like he made you feel some major ones
but it's like slowly removing the feeling

3968
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,660
of the road from the driver.

3969
01:45:13,661 --> 01:45:15,520
All this is electronic filters.

3970
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:16,570
Some people hate it.

3971
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:18,183
You know,

3972
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:20,430
some people that like really like cars,

3973
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:21,423
older cars,

3974
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,650
they'd love the fact
that you feel everything,

3975
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:23,940
you know,

3976
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,060
you feel the road,

3977
01:45:25,061 --> 01:45:25,960
you feel bumps,

3978
01:45:25,961 --> 01:45:28,060
you feel like the steering is alive.

3979
01:45:28,061 --> 01:45:30,310
You know these cards today,

3980
01:45:30,311 --> 01:45:32,740
like a lot of them they're starting
to make with electronic steering.

3981
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:34,030
So there's no,

3982
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,170
there's no difference.

3983
01:45:35,171 --> 01:45:38,740
It's not more difficult
to turn like under stress.

3984
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:42,340
It's not like you don't have a feeling
of like what the car is doing as you're

3985
01:45:42,341 --> 01:45:43,120
turning.

3986
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:44,320
It's like a numb feeling.

3987
01:45:44,321 --> 01:45:46,990
It's really kind of strange
because that's weird.

3988
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:47,500
Yeah.

3989
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:51,550
Like do you remember power steering
like old old car power steering?

3990
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:53,140
Like did you ever have one of those old

3991
01:45:53,190 --> 01:45:54,270
like American cars?

3992
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:58,230
I had the one and then one time it went
out in you're trying to dry and you have

3993
01:45:58,231 --> 01:46:01,170
to like to sit there
and try to turn it off.

3994
01:46:01,171 --> 01:46:02,004
It goes out.

3995
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:03,390
Especially if you have to park.

3996
01:46:03,391 --> 01:46:03,670
Yeah,

3997
01:46:03,670 --> 01:46:04,503
look stupid.

3998
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,030
You're never going to figure out
a way to get an impala and do it.

3999
01:46:07,031 --> 01:46:07,150
No

4000
01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:11,260
parking spot with manual steering and
you have to fucking John Rollo arms to

4001
01:46:11,261 --> 01:46:12,094
pull that off.

4002
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:13,331
But the,

4003
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:13,750
uh,

4004
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:16,900
the vagueness of that shit was so weird.

4005
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:18,183
Like you would,

4006
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:20,680
it would have like play
like left and right,

4007
01:46:20,681 --> 01:46:21,910
like serious play.

4008
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:23,350
Like you could go straight,

4009
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:25,720
you could go like that and go straight.

4010
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:26,613
Oh yeah.

4011
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:27,610
Like no problem.

4012
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:28,181
You know,

4013
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:29,560
it's like when you wanted to turn,

4014
01:46:29,561 --> 01:46:32,050
you had a really cracked up bitch,

4015
01:46:32,051 --> 01:46:33,100
had a station wagon,

4016
01:46:33,101 --> 01:46:36,430
a Ford Fairmont or whatever
it's called state wood panels.

4017
01:46:36,431 --> 01:46:37,264
I was like,

4018
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:39,010
well it's also the designs that they made,

4019
01:46:39,011 --> 01:46:40,270
although they were really cool,

4020
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:41,860
like the dodge charger.

4021
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:42,421
Like they,

4022
01:46:42,421 --> 01:46:45,430
they made some really cool designs and
like the 60s and when they were making

4023
01:46:45,431 --> 01:46:46,390
those big giant cars,

4024
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:50,080
but they're the most
Anelle dynamic you could

4025
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:51,093
think of.

4026
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:51,551
You know,

4027
01:46:51,551 --> 01:46:54,610
that big giant funnel and
the front of a dodge charger,

4028
01:46:54,611 --> 01:46:56,200
like that dukes of
Hazzard car that they had,

4029
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,000
that front is like,

4030
01:46:58,270 --> 01:47:00,730
it's like running with a
bucket in front of you,

4031
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:01,481
you know,

4032
01:47:01,481 --> 01:47:04,250
and the buckets like
soaking up all that air and,

4033
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:04,630
and,

4034
01:47:04,630 --> 01:47:05,381
and you know,

4035
01:47:05,381 --> 01:47:06,730
and it's not sleek at all,

4036
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:09,250
but they look so bad ass for the time.

4037
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:12,970
That would even consider the fact
that the aerodynamics were dog shit.

4038
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:13,901
They didn't know.

4039
01:47:13,901 --> 01:47:14,734
They didn't,

4040
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:17,320
I mean they sort of realize
it has to be kind of low.

4041
01:47:17,321 --> 01:47:20,170
It's better that way
and it's flat and just,

4042
01:47:20,530 --> 01:47:23,410
but they didn't like have air tunnels and
shipped back then when they would look

4043
01:47:23,411 --> 01:47:27,430
at the way the air flew over the
body and have a coefficient of drag

4044
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:29,040
reading to give each car.

4045
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:29,450
Yeah,

4046
01:47:29,450 --> 01:47:33,660
I miss bucket seats the most like being
able to just like sleep in your car back

4047
01:47:33,661 --> 01:47:35,730
or on your car without having
to worry about stick shifts.

4048
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:38,190
Things in the Middle and
cup holders and yeah,

4049
01:47:38,290 --> 01:47:38,971
I remember cars,

4050
01:47:38,971 --> 01:47:42,180
whether you would just hit that
lever and it fully reclined back.

4051
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:42,760
Yeah,

4052
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:43,860
I have a bed in your car.

4053
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:44,733
Yeah,

4054
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:45,623
you have a bed.

4055
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:47,040
Too many people were fucking in their car.

4056
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:48,060
They noticed that the,

4057
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:53,090
the sex rate and a birth rate was
going up so they removed those from the

4058
01:47:53,401 --> 01:47:54,234
population.

4059
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:54,931
It's a government,

4060
01:47:54,931 --> 01:47:55,764
it's a nanny state.

4061
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:00,030
I do think eventually it one day
I went to buy like legit van,

4062
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:01,560
not like minivan,

4063
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:05,100
like one of those vans that
your constraints parents
always had that you were

4064
01:48:05,101 --> 01:48:06,240
like this is bad ass.

4065
01:48:06,241 --> 01:48:07,230
I was like being in the future.

4066
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:08,820
Did they even make those anymore?

4067
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:09,360
What,

4068
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,080
what company was that that made
like the really tight big band?

4069
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:13,410
Well those are conversion vans.

4070
01:48:13,411 --> 01:48:15,810
I think you're thinking it
but there was a bunch of them.

4071
01:48:15,811 --> 01:48:18,300
It Fords and Chevy's and dodges.

4072
01:48:18,301 --> 01:48:23,301
But I think it's a weird thing that
the van is in popular when the SUV is,

4073
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:25,020
you know,

4074
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:26,880
people like SUV cause they were big.

4075
01:48:26,881 --> 01:48:28,400
You can put a lot of stuff in them.

4076
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:31,620
There's plenty of room but and
nothing big like a van side.

4077
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:32,821
I made a van,

4078
01:48:32,821 --> 01:48:34,440
it's like a giant truck,

4079
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:38,970
like a bakery truck with
a couple of seats in it.

4080
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:42,210
I say do they make vans?

4081
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:42,901
Of course they do.

4082
01:48:42,901 --> 01:48:43,860
They use them for work.

4083
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,300
We've um,

4084
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:49,110
we bought them or we rented them when
we were on the road before you remember

4085
01:48:49,111 --> 01:48:49,944
we're in Houston.

4086
01:48:50,170 --> 01:48:50,551
We were like,

4087
01:48:50,551 --> 01:48:50,881
fuck it,

4088
01:48:50,881 --> 01:48:51,714
let's get a van.

4089
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:53,280
It's going to utility van.

4090
01:48:53,281 --> 01:48:54,240
There was too many of us.

4091
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,250
That was back in the the Hay day,

4092
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:57,570
the initial,

4093
01:48:57,970 --> 01:48:59,370
the initial death squad weeks,

4094
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:01,223
there was a,

4095
01:49:01,290 --> 01:49:01,650
our,

4096
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:06,450
our numbers were vast and we were going
from town to town doing these gigs and

4097
01:49:06,451 --> 01:49:07,201
we'd bring like five,

4098
01:49:07,201 --> 01:49:08,070
six days with us.

4099
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,710
We had to figure out a
way to transport people,

4100
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:12,990
so we got it fucking cargo van to him.

4101
01:49:12,991 --> 01:49:13,791
I might buy a van,

4102
01:49:13,791 --> 01:49:16,230
I might sell my four to
edge and just by van.

4103
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,510
It's not a bad idea because first of all,

4104
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:20,370
you travel around with a lot of equipment.

4105
01:49:20,371 --> 01:49:24,570
Sometimes you know you'll have plenty
of room in there and you can do anything

4106
01:49:24,571 --> 01:49:25,261
you want inside.

4107
01:49:25,261 --> 01:49:26,730
You could deck it out like an NSA.

4108
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:27,564
That's right,

4109
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:28,090
Pam.

4110
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:28,831
Good Dude.

4111
01:49:28,831 --> 01:49:31,050
You could have a fucking flat
screen in there and the seat,

4112
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:34,680
she could pull over places if you
wanted it to and watch television.

4113
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:37,890
You could have satellite on your
roof of podcasts in the back.

4114
01:49:37,891 --> 01:49:38,910
Totally have a podcast.

4115
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:41,830
We could have a mold
podcast studio rather.

4116
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:44,580
There's no problem if there's any
TV shows that are still pimping.

4117
01:49:44,581 --> 01:49:45,414
Shit.

4118
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:51,210
Let's think that right there about
us developing a podcast studio van.

4119
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:52,440
Okay.

4120
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:53,160
Don't van.

4121
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,150
I'm for it man.

4122
01:49:54,210 --> 01:49:55,043
Honestly,

4123
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:56,460
what's cool about that dude,

4124
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:57,780
we could go anywhere with that.

4125
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:02,130
We talked about it once before you doing
when those silver bullet aero stream

4126
01:50:02,131 --> 01:50:02,330
one,

4127
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:03,163
like a small one.

4128
01:50:03,450 --> 01:50:05,850
I think just having a really nice van,

4129
01:50:05,851 --> 01:50:06,960
like a comfortable one.

4130
01:50:06,961 --> 01:50:07,770
Cause at my,

4131
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:11,460
my friend's neighbor had one growing up
in the 70s and I just remember it had a

4132
01:50:11,461 --> 01:50:14,310
curtain that divided it from the driver.

4133
01:50:14,311 --> 01:50:17,760
It was like there was like a bed where
you could like take these two couches and

4134
01:50:17,761 --> 01:50:20,940
put them together and it made a bed
and it had like a little disco ball in

4135
01:50:20,941 --> 01:50:21,121
there.

4136
01:50:21,121 --> 01:50:22,810
It was pretty much like a shagging wagon.

4137
01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:24,300
Oh you could totally get that.

4138
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:24,750
Yeah.

4139
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:29,160
But you could also get something where
it's a party bus or like say you pull up

4140
01:50:29,161 --> 01:50:29,731
to places.

4141
01:50:29,731 --> 01:50:32,070
Like we'd say we could
do a podcast and say,

4142
01:50:32,071 --> 01:50:32,251
hey,

4143
01:50:32,251 --> 01:50:33,031
we're going to be,

4144
01:50:33,031 --> 01:50:33,331
you know,

4145
01:50:33,331 --> 01:50:37,200
at this place you will and
we'll put speakers on the
outside of the door and you

4146
01:50:37,201 --> 01:50:38,670
guys can hang out and watch.

4147
01:50:38,671 --> 01:50:41,220
While we podcast quite out there,

4148
01:50:41,221 --> 01:50:42,270
you fucking savages.

4149
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:43,770
While the thing is plan,

4150
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,180
like you know how nutty that would be,

4151
01:50:45,181 --> 01:50:45,720
dude,

4152
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:46,650
we had a van.

4153
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,430
Okay.

4154
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:50,550
With broadcast speakers and we
pull up to like certain locations.

4155
01:50:50,551 --> 01:50:53,100
Like we set it up that we're
going to podcast places.

4156
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,990
We have chairs laid out,

4157
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,193
bad ass.

4158
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,340
Is there any of those shows on TV anymore?

4159
01:50:59,341 --> 01:50:59,691
That dude,

4160
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:00,230
that shit.

4161
01:51:00,230 --> 01:51:01,590
Well let's think about this.

4162
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:02,011
Yeah,

4163
01:51:02,011 --> 01:51:02,460
we can.

4164
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:03,660
I know some people.

4165
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,020
All right.

4166
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,270
I know there's a dude who
does a lot of car shows.

4167
01:51:06,271 --> 01:51:06,460
Man.

4168
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:09,120
He's the one that did rides
and overhauling my friend bud.

4169
01:51:09,870 --> 01:51:12,860
I could sell my Ford
edge and then go to like,

4170
01:51:13,290 --> 01:51:14,300
like a used car dealer,

4171
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:18,660
buy like a big van and
have them pimp it out to,

4172
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:19,503
we could even,

4173
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:23,850
we can't really broadcast on Ustream
from one of those fucking yes.

4174
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:24,660
Yeah.

4175
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:26,670
We can't really get bandwidth high enough.

4176
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:26,850
Now.

4177
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:27,541
We could get bandwidth.

4178
01:51:27,541 --> 01:51:29,220
This is exactly what
we're doing right now,

4179
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,360
which is okay.

4180
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:32,060
Remember we did it.

4181
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:32,750
Uh,

4182
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:33,830
we broadcast me,

4183
01:51:33,831 --> 01:51:35,110
you and Greg and Sam and

4184
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:36,120
Seattle,

4185
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:36,660
uh,

4186
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:37,493
eating the,

4187
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:37,951
you know,

4188
01:51:37,951 --> 01:51:39,210
a couple of right.

4189
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:40,470
When you do that with your,

4190
01:51:40,590 --> 01:51:42,180
well that was walking my iPad.

4191
01:51:42,181 --> 01:51:42,361
No,

4192
01:51:42,361 --> 01:51:43,920
that was just my iPad cellular iPad.

4193
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:44,581
Oh,

4194
01:51:44,581 --> 01:51:46,740
I thought you were using the
hotel's Wifi and it wasn't.

4195
01:51:46,741 --> 01:51:46,891
No,

4196
01:51:46,891 --> 01:51:47,701
it was just the cellular.

4197
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:48,240
That's right.

4198
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:48,630
Yeah.

4199
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:49,760
That was a widow.

4200
01:51:49,761 --> 01:51:50,670
Those Samsung things.

4201
01:51:50,671 --> 01:51:51,390
Right.

4202
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:51,990
Look at this.

4203
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:53,880
Look at this dude inside of a van.

4204
01:51:53,881 --> 01:51:54,630
Check this shit out.

4205
01:51:54,630 --> 01:51:55,321
It's Scooby Doo.

4206
01:51:55,321 --> 01:51:56,154
Live in that one.

4207
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:56,700
Oh,

4208
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:57,533
look at that.

4209
01:51:57,590 --> 01:51:57,931
You know,

4210
01:51:57,931 --> 01:51:58,291
that's fair.

4211
01:51:58,291 --> 01:52:03,291
There's Imax to bill into the
fucking the wall and that's the side.

4212
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:04,800
Wow.

4213
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,140
It's just mounted the watermelon.

4214
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:08,043
Yeah.

4215
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:09,190
Dude.

4216
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:10,023
Dude,

4217
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:13,973
look at the,

4218
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:16,860
we need to get one like Scooby Doos van.

4219
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:17,061
Oh,

4220
01:52:17,061 --> 01:52:17,611
look at that.

4221
01:52:17,611 --> 01:52:18,390
Pull that one up.

4222
01:52:18,390 --> 01:52:21,290
That one with the door is
that guys got up the same one.

4223
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,410
She looking at the same one.

4224
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:22,861
Pull up.

4225
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:23,340
Pull it up though.

4226
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:24,173
That photo.

4227
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:24,830
Yeah.

4228
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:25,050
No,

4229
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:28,090
just the photo of him at the door
in front of the door like that.

4230
01:52:28,790 --> 01:52:29,150
See,

4231
01:52:29,150 --> 01:52:31,140
I was on understanding the,

4232
01:52:31,530 --> 01:52:32,520
how it was set up.

4233
01:52:33,450 --> 01:52:34,171
Now I see it.

4234
01:52:34,171 --> 01:52:34,350
Yeah,

4235
01:52:34,350 --> 01:52:35,340
cause that's the door.

4236
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:38,580
See I would want it more couchy
and loungy but with cool stuff,

4237
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:38,941
you know what I mean?

4238
01:52:38,941 --> 01:52:41,020
This looks more like a mobile workstation,

4239
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,060
which is cool.

4240
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:43,560
But I think it should be more likely,

4241
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:45,440
right chillaxing pad.

4242
01:52:45,470 --> 01:52:46,130
Totally right.

4243
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:51,020
It should be like super comfortable
couch and a flat screen and us with

4244
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:51,854
headsets.

4245
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:54,230
So like we're like semicircular.

4246
01:52:54,231 --> 01:52:55,940
I liked that aspect of it.

4247
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:57,223
Right.

4248
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,600
And my circular phasing
a monitor on the outside,

4249
01:52:59,601 --> 01:53:03,260
it should look seventies and just
tinted windows so it doesn't look like,

4250
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:04,070
it's like,

4251
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:05,390
I wouldn't want it to be like,

4252
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:06,081
hey everyone,

4253
01:53:06,081 --> 01:53:06,381
look,

4254
01:53:06,381 --> 01:53:07,460
you could steal this.

4255
01:53:07,461 --> 01:53:09,170
And there's a million Mac imax in it.

4256
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:11,810
And there's also urban
people that I have to say,

4257
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,970
look that sober.

4258
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,490
He fucking got

4259
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:16,611
tagged up.

4260
01:53:16,611 --> 01:53:17,091
You know what I mean?

4261
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:18,290
So it's like attracting like,

4262
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,000
oh there's probably some
good speakers in this.

4263
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:20,211
You know what?

4264
01:53:20,211 --> 01:53:23,810
I know if you had access to
porn stars and I know you do,

4265
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:27,770
you could bribe them to blow David Cho
and maybe he would paint something on it

4266
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:28,604
for us.

4267
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:31,393
He's a bad ass.

4268
01:53:31,790 --> 01:53:32,151
I'm mad.

4269
01:53:32,151 --> 01:53:34,820
I'm mad man because that's
just too much painting to do.

4270
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,170
He doesn't have time to paint a van,

4271
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:36,500
but,

4272
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:41,320
well I'm upset because David Troy
was on Korea town episode of Anthony

4273
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,700
Bourdain's show on CNN and it happened.

4274
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:46,820
His episodes was the same weekend it
was supposed to be during all the Boston

4275
01:53:46,821 --> 01:53:47,510
bombings.

4276
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:50,000
So it recorded like 30 minutes of news,

4277
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:50,661
you know,

4278
01:53:50,661 --> 01:53:53,060
like Dvr and it just didn't record.

4279
01:53:53,061 --> 01:53:53,751
It just skipped it.

4280
01:53:53,751 --> 01:53:55,520
And so now there's like no way
that I don't know how to get,

4281
01:53:55,521 --> 01:53:56,690
it sucks.

4282
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:57,740
How is this new show?

4283
01:53:57,860 --> 01:53:58,790
I haven't seen the new show.

4284
01:53:58,791 --> 01:53:58,871
Yeah,

4285
01:53:58,871 --> 01:54:00,470
it's pretty much just like his old show.

4286
01:54:00,471 --> 01:54:02,420
He just goes to like different
cities and stuff like that.

4287
01:54:02,421 --> 01:54:03,111
It's pretty good though.

4288
01:54:03,111 --> 01:54:03,221
I,

4289
01:54:03,221 --> 01:54:07,040
I mean I wanted it to really see the
Korea town one cause Korea town's really

4290
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:07,610
cool.

4291
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:09,980
Like there's a lot of weird
things and Korea town,

4292
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:13,610
like there's like a club called the key
club where you just all these like doors

4293
01:54:13,611 --> 01:54:16,370
and you have to have a key
to get in like a speakeasy.

4294
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:17,100
Wow.

4295
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,190
There's a lot of weird karaoke bar place.

4296
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,090
This girlfriend,

4297
01:54:20,091 --> 01:54:20,710
have you heard of?

4298
01:54:20,710 --> 01:54:21,320
Uh,

4299
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:21,861
these clubs?

4300
01:54:21,861 --> 01:54:23,360
I think they're called girlfriend.

4301
01:54:23,361 --> 01:54:24,200
Girlfriend clubs.

4302
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:24,770
Yeah.

4303
01:54:24,770 --> 01:54:26,960
Where did these two girls just
sit down and act like your,

4304
01:54:26,961 --> 01:54:27,171
your,

4305
01:54:27,171 --> 01:54:28,220
your girlfriend for the whole day?

4306
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:29,570
I know dude who went to one of those?

4307
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,673
I think they're,

4308
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:31,850
what are they called?

4309
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:32,080
There's,

4310
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:32,351
there's,

4311
01:54:32,351 --> 01:54:32,990
there's no,

4312
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:35,900
there's another name for it
or companion companion club.

4313
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:37,040
Companionship clubs.

4314
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:37,880
That's what it is.

4315
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,890
It's really weird cause
they were pretty girls.

4316
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,540
There were essentially gold diggers.

4317
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:42,080
Right.

4318
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:47,080
And they were like hoping that they would
run into some like rich dude there who

4319
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:48,110
would take care of them.

4320
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:49,730
I think there was a lot of that going on,

4321
01:54:50,030 --> 01:54:54,590
but it was also probably a lot of like
low level planning for prostitution.

4322
01:54:55,010 --> 01:54:58,940
And then there's probably some
legit girls who just needed a job.

4323
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:01,820
And if I have to sit there and talk
to this fucking loser for two hours,

4324
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:03,260
a lot of models do it.

4325
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:03,401
I,

4326
01:55:03,401 --> 01:55:04,970
I know some of the clubs,

4327
01:55:04,971 --> 01:55:06,320
like there's a couple of models,

4328
01:55:06,321 --> 01:55:08,510
I know that Asian models and they're like,

4329
01:55:08,511 --> 01:55:08,841
no,

4330
01:55:08,841 --> 01:55:09,100
you know,

4331
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:10,280
that's of legit job.

4332
01:55:10,281 --> 01:55:12,860
Like they pay you $100 an hour to,

4333
01:55:12,861 --> 01:55:13,101
you know,

4334
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:14,660
just to sit there and talk to him.

4335
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:15,773
No,

4336
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,850
no prostitution at all.

4337
01:55:16,851 --> 01:55:19,570
So it depends on which one is
the 20 goods clubs you go to.

4338
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:20,773
Absolutely.

4339
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,240
Yeah.

4340
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:23,600
I knew a dude one to one of those who was,

4341
01:55:23,601 --> 01:55:24,770
he was like a sad case.

4342
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:25,580
Poor guy,

4343
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:26,450
couldn't get a girlfriend,

4344
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,160
he never could make it happen.

4345
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:29,091
So he would,

4346
01:55:29,091 --> 01:55:29,924
uh,

4347
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:31,820
he would go to these things
and hang out with girls.

4348
01:55:31,850 --> 01:55:33,620
I think if she had to pay
him x amount per hour,

4349
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:34,220
right.

4350
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:35,030
To sit with you,

4351
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:38,510
I would almost go because I like Asian
girls so much and they always Asian.

4352
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:39,890
Most of the time they are like,

4353
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:40,520
I don't feel it.

4354
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,980
I think they're the only other
one I've ever heard is Russian,

4355
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:44,220
but it's more

4356
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:45,090
mostly Asian.

4357
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:46,140
And he said that

4358
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:48,810
some of it was like married dudes would
come in and just didn't have anybody to

4359
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:49,530
talk to.

4360
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:52,650
They'll come in and talk to these young
pretty girls and then that's all they

4361
01:55:52,651 --> 01:55:53,670
wanted and then they would leave.

4362
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:54,490
Right.

4363
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:54,811
All right.

4364
01:55:54,811 --> 01:55:55,930
Happens in strip clubs everyday.

4365
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:56,730
You know?

4366
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:57,300
True.

4367
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:57,481
It was,

4368
01:55:57,481 --> 01:56:00,450
but they keep their clothes on these
places so he can pretend it's a nice girl.

4369
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:03,533
It's so weird.

4370
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:04,493
I kinda want to try.

4371
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:05,281
I like that shit.

4372
01:56:05,281 --> 01:56:06,740
I like trying that shit cause he's,

4373
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:10,020
the stories come from that shit experience
comes from it and then you think of

4374
01:56:10,021 --> 01:56:11,310
things he never thought of before.

4375
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:12,150
You know,

4376
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:13,890
I like doing that weird shit.

4377
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:16,890
That's why I like like trying all
these weird massage parlors lately.

4378
01:56:16,891 --> 01:56:20,670
Like it's weird to me that
that lifestyle even happens,

4379
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:21,683
you know?

4380
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:22,621
It's a,

4381
01:56:22,621 --> 01:56:23,520
it's very weird.

4382
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:27,200
And what's weird is how taboo
it is and this stupid country,

4383
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:29,840
everyone's so freaked out about it.

4384
01:56:29,841 --> 01:56:30,561
This is what we need brother.

4385
01:56:30,561 --> 01:56:31,790
We need to get an 18 van,

4386
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:34,190
make it look like the 18 oh fuck yeah.

4387
01:56:34,790 --> 01:56:35,600
That's what it is.

4388
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:37,250
Have it exactly like the 18 van.

4389
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,470
That's the shit right there.

4390
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,660
And do everything that
the 18 van has on it.

4391
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:44,503
Like a winch.

4392
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,300
The big thing over the grill,

4393
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:48,500
big metal shit.

4394
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:52,111
Actually no,

4395
01:56:52,111 --> 01:56:52,771
we shouldn't write.

4396
01:56:52,771 --> 01:56:54,000
We should come up with her own shit.

4397
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:55,710
We can't have the desk walk cat on.

4398
01:56:55,711 --> 01:56:55,930
I can,

4399
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:56,763
no,

4400
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:57,980
I want it to look kind of like,

4401
01:56:57,981 --> 01:56:59,040
like I was saying like seventies,

4402
01:56:59,170 --> 01:57:00,510
like you would just drive
by and they're like,

4403
01:57:00,511 --> 01:57:00,571
oh,

4404
01:57:00,571 --> 01:57:01,500
that's just an old van.

4405
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:02,011
You know what I mean?

4406
01:57:02,011 --> 01:57:02,761
Scooby Doo van.

4407
01:57:02,761 --> 01:57:03,241
What's it look up?

4408
01:57:03,241 --> 01:57:03,960
Scooby Doo van.

4409
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:04,141
No,

4410
01:57:04,141 --> 01:57:08,550
that's like fluorescent green with
flowers on it and orange pedal.

4411
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,473
Whereas this,

4412
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:12,120
there's a movie I saw the other day,

4413
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:12,540
uh,

4414
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:15,840
about these two prostitutes from
Amsterdam and there the roads,

4415
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:18,540
they were like the
oldest prostitutes ever.

4416
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,553
Oh.

4417
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:24,770
And they said that they saw more
than 355,000 clients to date.

4418
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:27,151
And they're,

4419
01:57:27,151 --> 01:57:29,040
they're twin sisters and there's,

4420
01:57:29,041 --> 01:57:29,370
uh,

4421
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:29,760
uh,

4422
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:30,451
oh my God.

4423
01:57:30,451 --> 01:57:31,001
Are you kidding me?

4424
01:57:31,001 --> 01:57:31,071
Yeah,

4425
01:57:31,071 --> 01:57:32,520
they just retired the other day,

4426
01:57:32,521 --> 01:57:33,271
but there's eight.

4427
01:57:33,271 --> 01:57:34,140
Just retired.

4428
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:34,470
Yeah,

4429
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:34,950
there's a,

4430
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:36,210
there's a Netflix.

4431
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:37,103
Uh,

4432
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:37,720
yeah,

4433
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:39,970
a movie all about them.

4434
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:40,091
Uh,

4435
01:57:40,091 --> 01:57:40,990
documentary,

4436
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:42,020
uh,

4437
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:43,900
the Scooby Doo van for
sale on Craig's list.

4438
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:46,390
I know there's a lot of
those because of the law.

4439
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:47,490
When the movies came out,

4440
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:48,161
this could be good.

4441
01:57:48,161 --> 01:57:48,341
One,

4442
01:57:48,341 --> 01:57:48,461
two,

4443
01:57:48,461 --> 01:57:48,851
and three.

4444
01:57:48,851 --> 01:57:51,280
They had a bunch of these
like advertising vans,

4445
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,870
so these ladies,

4446
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:53,681
these ladies.

4447
01:57:53,681 --> 01:57:54,161
But anyways,

4448
01:57:54,161 --> 01:57:54,690
it's a,

4449
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:56,020
it's a really interesting,

4450
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:56,530
uh,

4451
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:57,170
uh,

4452
01:57:57,170 --> 01:57:58,001
documentary.

4453
01:57:58,001 --> 01:57:58,731
I can't think of the,

4454
01:57:58,731 --> 01:57:58,940
see,

4455
01:57:58,940 --> 01:57:59,920
see if they say what it is,

4456
01:57:59,921 --> 01:58:00,300
but they're,

4457
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:04,360
their name is Louise and Martine
focons and their sisters that had been

4458
01:58:04,361 --> 01:58:07,270
prostitutes for over 50 years.

4459
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:08,200
And,

4460
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:08,591
uh,

4461
01:58:08,591 --> 01:58:13,210
it was the most creepiest documentary
because they talked about how they didn't

4462
01:58:13,211 --> 01:58:14,530
really want to do it anymore.

4463
01:58:14,531 --> 01:58:15,011
They were kind of,

4464
01:58:15,011 --> 01:58:15,191
you know,

4465
01:58:15,191 --> 01:58:15,371
like,

4466
01:58:15,371 --> 01:58:16,151
I'm an old lady,

4467
01:58:16,151 --> 01:58:16,984
I don't want to do this.

4468
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:19,990
But then they had to because they had no
other choice because they had no money.

4469
01:58:20,350 --> 01:58:22,030
And uh,

4470
01:58:22,330 --> 01:58:23,200
if you can look that,

4471
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:23,880
that,

4472
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:24,140
but,

4473
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:24,851
but what was crazy,

4474
01:58:24,851 --> 01:58:29,851
it's like she sat in the window and
she had to put on makeup and a wig on.

4475
01:58:30,770 --> 01:58:34,540
She put her little cleavage out in these
windows and they just have these chairs

4476
01:58:34,541 --> 01:58:34,961
and the windows.

4477
01:58:34,961 --> 01:58:35,870
I've never been to Amsterdam,

4478
01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:37,900
so I've never seen this
where they sit in the window,

4479
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:39,610
kind of like a puppy in the window.

4480
01:58:39,790 --> 01:58:40,623
They're like,

4481
01:58:40,690 --> 01:58:40,990
you know,

4482
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,070
making kissing noises and like,

4483
01:58:42,071 --> 01:58:42,341
hey,

4484
01:58:42,341 --> 01:58:43,061
why don't you come in here?

4485
01:58:43,061 --> 01:58:43,721
You want to fuck,

4486
01:58:43,721 --> 01:58:43,991
you know,

4487
01:58:43,991 --> 01:58:44,350
like,

4488
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:48,910
and these old ladies were doing it
and they would still get clients.

4489
01:58:48,970 --> 01:58:49,700
You know,

4490
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:52,960
everything cause like you'd walk by like
these kids would walk back and like,

4491
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:53,141
Hey,

4492
01:58:53,141 --> 01:58:54,370
you want to flip that Old Lady?

4493
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:55,533
What she said

4494
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:56,393
is what she said.

4495
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:58,020
I was a little tired.

4496
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:01,193
That's her quote.

4497
01:59:01,610 --> 01:59:01,830
I,

4498
01:59:01,830 --> 01:59:02,760
that was the first club.

4499
01:59:02,790 --> 01:59:03,960
I was a little tired,

4500
01:59:04,110 --> 01:59:04,620
tired.

4501
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:06,480
Luis told as it happens.

4502
01:59:06,481 --> 01:59:11,481
Host Carol off in an interview that
aired March 18th the sister said that old

4503
01:59:12,361 --> 01:59:17,361
age and arthritis where the main reasons
for their retirement and I've written

4504
01:59:17,431 --> 01:59:20,850
about their exploits in the new
book called the ladies of Amsterdam.

4505
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:22,560
The ladies of answers.

4506
01:59:22,790 --> 01:59:23,050
Yeah,

4507
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:24,220
I think that's the name of the movie.

4508
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:24,761
Awesome.

4509
01:59:24,761 --> 01:59:25,980
Maybe fucking name.

4510
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:27,670
And it was really interesting.

4511
01:59:27,671 --> 01:59:30,200
Like here's some photos of
them sitting in their window.

4512
01:59:30,201 --> 01:59:30,581
See like,

4513
01:59:30,581 --> 01:59:31,300
here's,

4514
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:34,360
here's like the little window
in front of the door crunched.

4515
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:35,200
Is that them?

4516
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:36,033
Yeah.

4517
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:36,841
Oh my God.

4518
01:59:36,841 --> 01:59:39,850
That would sit there with
a big jacket on like that.

4519
01:59:39,970 --> 01:59:40,150
It's,

4520
01:59:40,150 --> 01:59:40,271
oh,

4521
01:59:40,271 --> 01:59:41,750
it's called meet the Falcons.

4522
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:42,613
Oh my Americans.

4523
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:45,040
Oldest prostitutes who
get that got it on her.

4524
01:59:46,350 --> 01:59:46,571
I mean,

4525
01:59:46,571 --> 01:59:47,261
they used to be,

4526
01:59:47,261 --> 01:59:47,860
you know,

4527
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:49,030
Ralphie may look at that.

4528
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:50,530
That's how they would
walk down the street.

4529
01:59:50,531 --> 01:59:52,720
And the documentary was kind of cute.

4530
01:59:52,721 --> 01:59:52,891
Does it?

4531
01:59:52,891 --> 01:59:54,680
Cause there was so such an old ladies.

4532
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:55,990
Oh my God.

4533
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:56,831
But it was awesome.

4534
01:59:56,831 --> 01:59:58,060
Really disturbing.

4535
01:59:58,120 --> 02:00:00,850
They look like dude's
pretending to be old ladies.

4536
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:02,620
Like one of those theme movies.

4537
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:03,520
Pills.

4538
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:03,701
Yeah.

4539
02:00:03,701 --> 02:00:04,870
They look with Dustin Hoffman.

4540
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:05,590
Yes.

4541
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:05,801
Yeah,

4542
02:00:05,801 --> 02:00:06,470
they do.

4543
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:06,890
They look,

4544
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:07,070
yeah,

4545
02:00:07,070 --> 02:00:07,880
they look fake.

4546
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:08,061
Yeah.

4547
02:00:08,061 --> 02:00:10,190
Look to Benny Hills and dresses.

4548
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:10,850
I know.

4549
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:11,683
Wow.

4550
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:12,660
But,

4551
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:16,190
and the darkness that they must have
seen how much people they fucked.

4552
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:17,323
Just think of that.

4553
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:21,800
The weirdness that they must've
seen in sucking 350,000 Cox,

4554
02:00:23,110 --> 02:00:25,690
she's just think of the herpes they have.

4555
02:00:25,691 --> 02:00:27,300
They could probably got mostly her B.

4556
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:28,473
That's why they were red.

4557
02:00:29,370 --> 02:00:30,220
It's just a big heart.

4558
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:32,770
It's like the right hat club.

4559
02:00:33,070 --> 02:00:33,903
They're all like,

4560
02:00:33,930 --> 02:00:38,250
their body just becomes like a
battleground and all the Siv,

4561
02:00:38,251 --> 02:00:39,120
HIV,

4562
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:39,711
s,

4563
02:00:39,711 --> 02:00:39,941
t,

4564
02:00:39,941 --> 02:00:40,680
d,

4565
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:41,400
syphilis,

4566
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:42,031
gonorrhea,

4567
02:00:42,031 --> 02:00:42,720
aids,

4568
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:44,790
it all just battled it out
together for dominance,

4569
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:47,123
see who wins.

4570
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:49,050
And meanwhile she stays healthy.

4571
02:00:49,230 --> 02:00:51,360
She's tastes healthy cause
they didn't attack each other.

4572
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:53,220
They don't even go after the immune system

4573
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:55,891
is going to be,

4574
02:00:55,891 --> 02:00:56,724
it's me out.

4575
02:00:56,870 --> 02:00:58,050
I mentioned that with your kids.

4576
02:00:58,230 --> 02:00:59,760
That's when it would really gross you out.

4577
02:00:59,910 --> 02:01:00,750
Imagine if you,

4578
02:01:00,751 --> 02:01:01,110
uh,

4579
02:01:01,110 --> 02:01:04,840
had a kid with a check and then you
weren't really that into it and you'd kind

4580
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:08,790
of like kept away from her and left and
didn't pay child support and she went

4581
02:01:08,791 --> 02:01:12,660
into property and then you found out
many years later that your kid retired as

4582
02:01:12,661 --> 02:01:14,820
the oldest prostitute ever in Amsterdam.

4583
02:01:15,810 --> 02:01:16,620
You know,

4584
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:16,861
man,

4585
02:01:16,861 --> 02:01:18,780
you want to talk about
regret at someone's,

4586
02:01:18,781 --> 02:01:21,750
a little girl that
someone's a little girl.

4587
02:01:21,751 --> 02:01:24,690
That was someone's little cute baby that
was so sweet and everything she said

4588
02:01:24,691 --> 02:01:25,524
was adorable.

4589
02:01:25,530 --> 02:01:26,370
Oh my goodness.

4590
02:01:26,371 --> 02:01:26,881
Look at her.

4591
02:01:26,881 --> 02:01:27,900
She's so precious.

4592
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:30,210
Next thing you know,

4593
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:32,970
it doesn't really end that well.

4594
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:34,253
This story.

4595
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,010
Well,

4596
02:01:35,010 --> 02:01:35,940
how did it end?

4597
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:36,600
Well,

4598
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:37,800
do you really want to hear the end?

4599
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:38,930
Yeah.

4600
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:39,290
Well,

4601
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:40,520
they became a prostitute

4602
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:45,520
for 50 years and soc 350,000 decks,

4603
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:47,030
both of them and they're twins.

4604
02:01:49,070 --> 02:01:49,910
God Damn,

4605
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:51,381
that's hardcore,

4606
02:01:51,381 --> 02:01:52,130
man.

4607
02:01:52,130 --> 02:01:53,570
I've always wanted to have twins.

4608
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:57,110
Have you ever known someone
that's been a prostitute?

4609
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:57,771
It'll be able to,

4610
02:01:57,771 --> 02:01:57,910
well,

4611
02:01:57,910 --> 02:01:58,191
yeah.

4612
02:01:58,191 --> 02:01:58,491
You know,

4613
02:01:58,491 --> 02:01:59,630
a few of prostitutes.

4614
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:01,003
What is that?

4615
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:04,150
Is that it has to be one of the weirdest,

4616
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:05,121
well,

4617
02:02:05,121 --> 02:02:08,420
the girl I knew in Ohio that the first
girl I ever met that was a prostitute,

4618
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:09,050
she was like,

4619
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:11,930
I girl that tried to be
a porn star from Ohio.

4620
02:02:11,931 --> 02:02:16,100
She would come to la once a month and
stay there for a week and film a bunch of

4621
02:02:16,101 --> 02:02:17,600
Shit and then come back.

4622
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:18,830
But when she came back,

4623
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:20,660
I mean she made all this money from being,

4624
02:02:20,661 --> 02:02:20,871
you know,

4625
02:02:20,871 --> 02:02:23,270
making all these movies and
fucking and fucking people.

4626
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:24,890
But when she came back she was like,

4627
02:02:24,891 --> 02:02:25,161
all right,

4628
02:02:25,161 --> 02:02:26,900
I don't want to be a stripper
out or anything like that.

4629
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:28,850
So she would just do like the,

4630
02:02:28,851 --> 02:02:29,780
the escort shit.

4631
02:02:30,340 --> 02:02:30,860
Ooh.

4632
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:31,221
You know,

4633
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:32,054
she did it,

4634
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:33,653
uh,

4635
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:36,140
quite regularly and she was just making,

4636
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:36,321
I mean,

4637
02:02:36,321 --> 02:02:38,420
she had more money than anybody I knew.

4638
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:38,841
You know.

4639
02:02:38,841 --> 02:02:39,021
I mean,

4640
02:02:39,021 --> 02:02:41,930
she had like the best
house in Ohio at Ohio.

4641
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:42,773
How many

4642
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:45,170
our age group meeting.

4643
02:02:45,171 --> 02:02:47,090
Like she had like a really nice fat place,

4644
02:02:47,091 --> 02:02:47,270
you know,

4645
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:50,350
compared to like all of us who are
like living like five guys in a fucking

4646
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:51,220
right.

4647
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:52,053
You know,

4648
02:02:52,150 --> 02:02:53,230
it's kind of crazy isn't it?

4649
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:56,950
It's crazy that you can massage
people but you can't massage decks.

4650
02:02:57,460 --> 02:02:57,850
Right.

4651
02:02:57,850 --> 02:03:00,580
Cause that's essentially
what being a prostitute is.

4652
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:03,280
Because people love to have sex,

4653
02:03:03,281 --> 02:03:03,850
right?

4654
02:03:03,850 --> 02:03:04,690
They love def sex.

4655
02:03:04,990 --> 02:03:08,290
But if you love to have sex and
someone gives you money for it,

4656
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:10,060
that somehow or another illegal,

4657
02:03:10,090 --> 02:03:11,800
well people love to get massages,

4658
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:12,910
love given sizes.

4659
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:13,871
Uh,

4660
02:03:13,871 --> 02:03:17,650
but the massage is only good
for one person or you know,

4661
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:20,590
if you're a chicken loves Dick
and you're getting fucked,

4662
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:21,131
you're actually,

4663
02:03:21,131 --> 02:03:22,360
it feels good for you to,

4664
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:27,720
a massage is actually more
like prostitution then even
prostitution because it's

4665
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,460
just some one person.

4666
02:03:30,461 --> 02:03:34,660
You're not even having sex like a blow
job I guess is like prostitution or like

4667
02:03:34,661 --> 02:03:35,200
a hand job.

4668
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:38,410
Well what if like taking like you meet a
girl on a blind date and you'd take her

4669
02:03:38,411 --> 02:03:38,990
out to dinner.

4670
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:42,240
He spent all this money on drinks
and food and then you go and fucker.

4671
02:03:42,250 --> 02:03:46,900
What about just not drinking the food
or eating and just giving her the money

4672
02:03:46,901 --> 02:03:49,090
and skipping that part like
it's like the same shit.

4673
02:03:50,170 --> 02:03:53,590
Brilliant nanny state government
is trying to encourage marriage,

4674
02:03:53,590 --> 02:03:54,423
friendship.

4675
02:03:54,790 --> 02:03:56,530
They want you guys to
really like each other.

4676
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:57,880
Why don't you really like each other?

4677
02:03:57,881 --> 02:03:59,410
Why don't you be sweet
to each other for real?

4678
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:00,520
Did Not do it for money.

4679
02:04:00,521 --> 02:04:01,540
You can't do it for money.

4680
02:04:01,780 --> 02:04:02,613
Can't do it for money.

4681
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:03,850
You know why he can't do it for money?

4682
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:05,360
Because I can't trust
that you're going to pay.

4683
02:04:05,361 --> 02:04:06,400
You pay the taxes.

4684
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:07,713
That's why,

4685
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,850
and then also it looks bad.

4686
02:04:10,090 --> 02:04:12,940
If politicians pass laws and
say prostitution's legal.

4687
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:13,721
Then people go,

4688
02:04:13,721 --> 02:04:14,860
why do you want that?

4689
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:15,760
Huh?

4690
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:16,690
Eliot Spitzer.

4691
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:20,980
It's caught a better name like and
kisses companion kisses on my Dick.

4692
02:04:20,981 --> 02:04:23,230
Jesus hugs son caught Jesus hugs.

4693
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:24,093
She's just hug.

4694
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:28,230
It's a weird thing that something
that people love to do it.

4695
02:04:28,420 --> 02:04:31,600
It's like a freely CD thing.

4696
02:04:31,601 --> 02:04:32,530
If you get paid for it,

4697
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:33,550
that's weird,

4698
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:35,500
right?

4699
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:36,790
But it's not everywhere.

4700
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:38,440
Our country's attitude

4701
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:41,290
about it is archaic compared
to the rest of the world.

4702
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:42,730
Completely archaic.

4703
02:04:43,570 --> 02:04:47,950
Our country's attitude about all kinds
of things just about sex and nudity and

4704
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:49,900
and especially when it comes to women,

4705
02:04:49,901 --> 02:04:50,800
men for women.

4706
02:04:50,801 --> 02:04:55,801
I think our country treats women
that are into Saks and enjoy sex.

4707
02:04:57,540 --> 02:05:01,600
They frown on them so much
in comparison to like Canada,

4708
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:02,381
like Canada,

4709
02:05:02,381 --> 02:05:04,180
like girls that you meet from Canada,

4710
02:05:04,370 --> 02:05:06,130
they're like way cooler about sucks,

4711
02:05:06,190 --> 02:05:09,040
like not obviously massive generalization,

4712
02:05:09,190 --> 02:05:09,570
right?

4713
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:10,270
Vancouver,

4714
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:13,150
plenty of really cool
women in this country too,

4715
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:17,830
but I've met a lot of them that were
like super nice and friendly and then you

4716
02:05:17,831 --> 02:05:18,011
go,

4717
02:05:18,011 --> 02:05:18,651
where are you from?

4718
02:05:18,651 --> 02:05:19,690
And they were like Canada and you're like,

4719
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:20,410
oh,

4720
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:21,243
okay.

4721
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:22,900
Like you don't have any weird hangups.

4722
02:05:22,970 --> 02:05:23,910
I this a lot.

4723
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:24,821
The weird,

4724
02:05:24,821 --> 02:05:26,110
the weird sex hang up.

4725
02:05:26,980 --> 02:05:27,461
It's like,

4726
02:05:27,461 --> 02:05:28,241
you know girls were in,

4727
02:05:28,241 --> 02:05:29,530
the guys are going to think they're slut.

4728
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:31,180
Have you ever dated a girl?

4729
02:05:31,620 --> 02:05:34,300
Fucked her on the first day and then like
she was like your your girlfriend for

4730
02:05:34,301 --> 02:05:35,080
years.

4731
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:35,500
Oh yeah.

4732
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:35,711
Yeah,

4733
02:05:35,711 --> 02:05:36,880
me too all the time.

4734
02:05:36,881 --> 02:05:38,200
It's totally like the girl,

4735
02:05:38,230 --> 02:05:41,230
that girl think that that's
a bad thing to hold back.

4736
02:05:41,231 --> 02:05:42,070
No it's not.

4737
02:05:42,610 --> 02:05:43,870
I mean it's not wise.

4738
02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:44,930
Yeah,

4739
02:05:44,930 --> 02:05:45,910
definitely not wise.

4740
02:05:45,970 --> 02:05:47,410
Actually when they do do it,

4741
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:49,960
I now think different about
it than I used to come out.

4742
02:05:49,970 --> 02:05:50,230
I'm like,

4743
02:05:50,230 --> 02:05:50,830
ah,

4744
02:05:50,830 --> 02:05:52,030
that was too easy,

4745
02:05:53,370 --> 02:05:54,203
but I'm not going to be like,

4746
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:54,431
no,

4747
02:05:54,431 --> 02:05:55,420
I'm not dating you anymore.

4748
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:56,270
When you were younger

4749
02:05:56,270 --> 02:05:56,900
especially,

4750
02:05:56,900 --> 02:05:59,900
it's so hard to find someone
that you really enjoy.

4751
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:01,033
It's hard.

4752
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:04,730
Like you're looking for pretty and you
look at for what you're attracted to and

4753
02:06:04,731 --> 02:06:06,260
then once you get to them,

4754
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:09,650
well it's sort of like
you start reading a book,

4755
02:06:09,770 --> 02:06:10,221
you know,

4756
02:06:10,221 --> 02:06:13,190
and you don't know what the hell the
stories about until you get into the book.

4757
02:06:13,490 --> 02:06:14,900
And so you meet him and you go,

4758
02:06:14,901 --> 02:06:15,081
wow,

4759
02:06:15,081 --> 02:06:15,771
she's pretty.

4760
02:06:15,771 --> 02:06:17,030
And she talks and you know,

4761
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:18,860
we're talking to each other and you know,

4762
02:06:18,861 --> 02:06:20,990
you'd like to get her naked and like get,

4763
02:06:20,991 --> 02:06:21,231
you know,

4764
02:06:21,231 --> 02:06:21,560
you bet.

4765
02:06:21,560 --> 02:06:25,070
But once you start finding
out what the story is like,

4766
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:25,751
oh,

4767
02:06:25,751 --> 02:06:26,031
okay,

4768
02:06:26,031 --> 02:06:26,841
I don't like the story.

4769
02:06:26,841 --> 02:06:29,120
I got to go you fucking piece of shit.

4770
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:31,430
And then you have to try to
find one that you actually do,

4771
02:06:31,431 --> 02:06:35,540
like a story that you like and the idea
that you can meet someone and right away

4772
02:06:35,541 --> 02:06:36,740
know that you liked that story.

4773
02:06:36,830 --> 02:06:37,700
Sometimes you do,

4774
02:06:38,150 --> 02:06:40,970
sometimes you meet someone and then
it's fucking awesome from the moment you

4775
02:06:40,971 --> 02:06:41,241
meet him,

4776
02:06:41,241 --> 02:06:43,610
you're like love being around them
and you never have any problems,

4777
02:06:44,270 --> 02:06:46,070
but for the most part that doesn't happen.

4778
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:46,820
Right.

4779
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:48,650
Especially if you're a fucking idiot.

4780
02:06:48,770 --> 02:06:49,603
Right,

4781
02:06:50,650 --> 02:06:51,483
right.

4782
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:57,290
We all know that one dude at least
who will never have a relationship.

4783
02:06:57,770 --> 02:06:59,660
He's just unfuckable.

4784
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:00,780
He just,

4785
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:02,480
he just can't keep it together.

4786
02:07:02,481 --> 02:07:03,380
Can never get a girlfriend.

4787
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:07,030
Like it'll have one fuck it up and
I'll have another in fucking right.

4788
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:07,440
Yeah.

4789
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:10,580
We all know that one dude who
just never has a girlfriend,

4790
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:12,470
just can't keep it together.

4791
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,010
Yeah.

4792
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:19,010
I'm trying not to have the
more older I'm getting the,

4793
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:22,100
I'm trying more and more
not to have girlfriends,

4794
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:24,380
even though I don't like being alone.

4795
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:25,381
But I also,

4796
02:07:25,381 --> 02:07:26,214
I also,

4797
02:07:26,510 --> 02:07:31,400
it seems like my mind's just check I'm
in a place right now where I'm trying to

4798
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:33,620
do a lot of stuff,

4799
02:07:33,650 --> 02:07:34,311
you know what I mean?

4800
02:07:34,311 --> 02:07:36,320
Instead of where back
in like 10 years ago,

4801
02:07:36,321 --> 02:07:36,820
I'm more like,

4802
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:39,130
I just like couches and watching TV,

4803
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:40,640
doing a lot of stuff.

4804
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:41,140
I mean,

4805
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:41,801
you still go out.

4806
02:07:41,801 --> 02:07:41,920
Yeah,

4807
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:42,753
a lot too.

4808
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:43,593
But you're,

4809
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:45,130
you've got a lot of podcasts,

4810
02:07:45,131 --> 02:07:45,970
a lot of projects,

4811
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:46,811
art projects,

4812
02:07:46,811 --> 02:07:50,440
all these different things you're doing
and like the cat shirts and just doing

4813
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,900
comedy's biggest thing,

4814
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:53,950
all of it taken out the comedy clubs.

4815
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:56,200
Well that's another issue too because,

4816
02:07:56,201 --> 02:07:56,470
uh,

4817
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:59,080
if you have a girl and
you're dating her and you,

4818
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:01,270
you're out almost every
night doing comedy,

4819
02:08:01,310 --> 02:08:02,020
right.

4820
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:02,950
They're going to get annoyed at you,

4821
02:08:02,951 --> 02:08:03,270
man.

4822
02:08:03,270 --> 02:08:03,760
Yeah.

4823
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:04,031
I've had,

4824
02:08:04,031 --> 02:08:07,360
I've had girls that I was dating and got
annoyed at me being a comedian and none

4825
02:08:07,361 --> 02:08:08,950
of them want to just hang
out at a comedy club.

4826
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:09,611
Well,

4827
02:08:09,611 --> 02:08:11,500
some of them don't mind
for a little while.

4828
02:08:11,501 --> 02:08:12,161
They don't mind,

4829
02:08:12,161 --> 02:08:13,840
but after awhile it's
like God damn it dude.

4830
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:16,540
I can't hear you tell the same
fucking jokes three nights in a row.

4831
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:16,980
Right?

4832
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:18,190
Like can we go do something?

4833
02:08:18,430 --> 02:08:18,821
I can't.

4834
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:19,720
I got to work on my set.

4835
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:21,130
Oh God.

4836
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:22,330
You know,

4837
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:23,290
girls got a job,

4838
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:24,220
she works all day.

4839
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:28,660
And then after work you guys are supposed
to get together and you got to go do

4840
02:08:28,661 --> 02:08:30,160
it set and

4841
02:08:32,370 --> 02:08:33,190
yeah.

4842
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:34,270
Then Nate,

4843
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:35,081
Kate dating someone.

4844
02:08:35,081 --> 02:08:35,801
That's a comic though.

4845
02:08:35,801 --> 02:08:36,634
That's

4846
02:08:37,870 --> 02:08:39,280
highly unrecommended as well.

4847
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:40,060
Right?

4848
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:41,500
That's one of the hardest
things in life man.

4849
02:08:41,501 --> 02:08:43,030
It's finding someone who compliments you.

4850
02:08:43,650 --> 02:08:44,590
Like what?

4851
02:08:44,591 --> 02:08:44,861
I mean,

4852
02:08:44,861 --> 02:08:46,360
not like says you look so good.

4853
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:50,920
But I mean like someone who you're there
style of being a person and your style

4854
02:08:50,921 --> 02:08:52,210
of being a person like mesh up.

4855
02:08:52,211 --> 02:08:54,000
Well it's very difficult to find.

4856
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:57,400
She's in wine cause I think about
that sometimes like you know,

4857
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:59,670
we unlikely couples that we know.

4858
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:00,270
You know,

4859
02:09:00,270 --> 02:09:00,511
we knew,

4860
02:09:00,511 --> 02:09:02,080
we know so many couples were like,

4861
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:02,400
you know,

4862
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:02,641
yeah.

4863
02:09:02,641 --> 02:09:05,550
I guess somehow or another
that shit works like that.

4864
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:06,401
His thing.

4865
02:09:06,401 --> 02:09:07,330
And her thing together.

4866
02:09:07,331 --> 02:09:10,690
Like I wouldn't want to be with her and
if I was a girl would want to be with

4867
02:09:10,691 --> 02:09:11,110
him,

4868
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:13,060
but together they figure it out.

4869
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:14,213
Yeah.

4870
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:14,861
Yeah.

4871
02:09:14,861 --> 02:09:16,830
There's some weird couples that I like.

4872
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:17,920
I think the best couple,

4873
02:09:17,921 --> 02:09:19,640
I know it's time to grow.

4874
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:21,410
I was going to say that too,

4875
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:25,420
that they seem like they were
designed for each other there.

4876
02:09:25,450 --> 02:09:27,820
I think there's like the kind of couple
of where you're going to find out that

4877
02:09:27,821 --> 02:09:29,450
they're related in a couple of years.

4878
02:09:31,090 --> 02:09:32,530
There's something to it that it's like,

4879
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:35,110
this seems a little too perfect.

4880
02:09:35,190 --> 02:09:36,570
They're so friendly to each other.

4881
02:09:36,571 --> 02:09:37,404
It's so nice.

4882
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:39,510
But if you stop and think about it,

4883
02:09:39,690 --> 02:09:41,160
if any one of our friends,

4884
02:09:42,090 --> 02:09:42,591
not Ari,

4885
02:09:42,591 --> 02:09:43,424
he would get grumpy.

4886
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:45,120
You wouldn't want him to be a girl.

4887
02:09:45,390 --> 02:09:46,940
No ducking.

4888
02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:47,550
Wouldn't mind.

4889
02:09:47,550 --> 02:09:48,720
But he might snap at you too.

4890
02:09:48,930 --> 02:09:49,763
Yeah.

4891
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:54,970
If he takes off some of our best friends
and turn their personality into to uh,

4892
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:56,190
make them a female,

4893
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:58,350
you would be the best way.

4894
02:09:58,580 --> 02:10:01,590
The best girlfriend you
want to fucking slap.

4895
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:05,370
You would be a dirty bitch that
I could let my friends fuck.

4896
02:10:05,730 --> 02:10:06,151
That's,

4897
02:10:06,151 --> 02:10:06,984
you'd be,

4898
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:09,990
I could bring my friends over.

4899
02:10:09,991 --> 02:10:10,830
They would fuck you.

4900
02:10:11,650 --> 02:10:12,510
It'd be like whatever.

4901
02:10:12,511 --> 02:10:13,440
I like sex.

4902
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:15,180
Whew.

4903
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:17,221
Yeah.

4904
02:10:17,221 --> 02:10:18,900
I don't think I've ever dated a sexist.

4905
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:22,350
I've never been successful
dating another comedian ever.

4906
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:25,500
I dated one during the open mic days.

4907
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:28,320
I dated this girl but didn't work out.

4908
02:10:28,750 --> 02:10:30,550
It would be in your head.

4909
02:10:30,551 --> 02:10:31,570
It seems like it would be the best one.

4910
02:10:31,571 --> 02:10:32,770
I've did it a few comics,

4911
02:10:32,771 --> 02:10:34,280
but it's always was fun

4912
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:36,260
like running material
by them because they're,

4913
02:10:36,261 --> 02:10:36,900
you know,

4914
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:37,671
them helping you.

4915
02:10:37,671 --> 02:10:38,720
That was really cool.

4916
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:39,703
I think it would be,

4917
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:42,140
but the downfall is like
if you break up with them,

4918
02:10:42,141 --> 02:10:44,930
they're in your fucking sandbox
with you for the rest of it.

4919
02:10:44,931 --> 02:10:45,111
You know,

4920
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:47,900
like I was already situation with Esther.

4921
02:10:47,901 --> 02:10:49,760
I still have to fucking
see Esther like every,

4922
02:10:49,761 --> 02:10:51,470
I mean I love seeing Esther Esther now,

4923
02:10:51,471 --> 02:10:52,304
but for a while.

4924
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:53,443
And Tony,

4925
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:56,310
you know what's weird
with Tony Hinchcliffe is,

4926
02:10:56,311 --> 02:11:00,260
is that Tony dated her for like
a year and a half before you,

4927
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:01,610
before right before me.

4928
02:11:01,630 --> 02:11:02,210
Oh my,

4929
02:11:02,210 --> 02:11:07,210
I didn't know Tony and so then
when I met Esther I had no idea.

4930
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:09,140
Did you ever fuck her and go to Tony?

4931
02:11:09,150 --> 02:11:09,983
Fuck you like this?

4932
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:11,230
No,

4933
02:11:11,230 --> 02:11:11,370
no.

4934
02:11:11,370 --> 02:11:13,690
Influx or like I like the way you do.

4935
02:11:14,020 --> 02:11:14,853
Do you spit in her mouth?

4936
02:11:16,390 --> 02:11:18,220
Barry crazy to go.

4937
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:19,600
Do you go 50 shades of gray on her?

4938
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:20,390
Fuck yeah.

4939
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:20,970
No,

4940
02:11:20,970 --> 02:11:21,280
excuse me.

4941
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:21,470
She'll,

4942
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:24,950
she's pretty intensive bed but
no like thing were about it was,

4943
02:11:24,951 --> 02:11:28,810
is that I then met Tony after
we started dating because I the,

4944
02:11:28,820 --> 02:11:29,890
I had to like he,

4945
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:33,470
Tony was like calling her still and doing
that kind of shit where like it would

4946
02:11:33,471 --> 02:11:34,340
be four in the morning be like,

4947
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:34,970
who's gone?

4948
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:35,330
You'd be like,

4949
02:11:35,330 --> 02:11:35,841
Oh shit,

4950
02:11:35,841 --> 02:11:36,590
Tony,

4951
02:11:36,590 --> 02:11:37,430
who's that Tony Guy?

4952
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:40,820
So then the one of the
first Brodie podcasts I did,

4953
02:11:40,821 --> 02:11:42,140
Brody experiment number one,

4954
02:11:42,141 --> 02:11:44,900
I think I invited Tony to be on the,

4955
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:45,711
on the show.

4956
02:11:45,711 --> 02:11:47,180
Didn't even know the guy like,

4957
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:48,890
like with Benji,

4958
02:11:48,891 --> 02:11:51,710
just to kind of make it so like
right now we know each other

4959
02:11:54,510 --> 02:11:56,480
cause yeah.

4960
02:11:56,481 --> 02:12:01,280
That's how I knew Tonia now so that you
could talk to him and tell him not call

4961
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:02,173
asteroid.

4962
02:12:02,410 --> 02:12:04,460
Well there was a lot of things going on.

4963
02:12:04,461 --> 02:12:05,294
One was that,

4964
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:05,880
that,

4965
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:07,640
that he was like doing that too.

4966
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:08,571
It was kind of like,

4967
02:12:08,571 --> 02:12:08,781
look,

4968
02:12:08,781 --> 02:12:12,110
I don't want some angry guy
getting pissed off at me,

4969
02:12:12,111 --> 02:12:12,261
you know,

4970
02:12:12,261 --> 02:12:13,094
that's a comic.

4971
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:15,050
I was trying to be like,

4972
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:15,441
hey,

4973
02:12:15,441 --> 02:12:16,274
this is me.

4974
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:17,180
Nice to meet you.

4975
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:17,601
Oh yes,

4976
02:12:17,601 --> 02:12:18,590
I'm dating Esther now.

4977
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:19,370
Hey,

4978
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:19,701
welcome.

4979
02:12:19,701 --> 02:12:20,090
You know,

4980
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:21,170
you can't fuck her anymore.

4981
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:22,160
Right.

4982
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:23,420
But it was weird that now we're like,

4983
02:12:23,421 --> 02:12:25,460
me and Tony are like great
friends and he's awesome.

4984
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:26,653
He's a good guy.

4985
02:12:26,890 --> 02:12:27,161
Yeah.

4986
02:12:27,161 --> 02:12:28,750
He did a Indianapolis with me.

4987
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:29,673
He killed two.

4988
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:30,100
Yeah,

4989
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:30,431
it was,

4990
02:12:30,431 --> 02:12:30,940
um,

4991
02:12:30,940 --> 02:12:31,780
it was really fun.

4992
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:33,273
He's a good dude.

4993
02:12:33,610 --> 02:12:34,020
Like,

4994
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:34,270
look,

4995
02:12:34,270 --> 02:12:36,010
I said several times on the podcast,

4996
02:12:36,011 --> 02:12:39,850
one of the things that I really
love is seeing the new guys come up.

4997
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:41,073
So fun.

4998
02:12:41,680 --> 02:12:42,310
It's like,

4999
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:46,960
I love that there's pretty much a
never ending supply of standup comedy.

5000
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:49,120
It's like you're always
going to have more people.

5001
02:12:49,150 --> 02:12:52,330
There's always going to be new ones coming
up is always going to be people that

5002
02:12:52,331 --> 02:12:53,170
are getting better.

5003
02:12:53,290 --> 02:12:53,980
It's just,

5004
02:12:53,980 --> 02:12:55,000
it never ends.

5005
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:56,350
Luckily.

5006
02:12:56,350 --> 02:12:58,750
I think the clubs need to
have more open mikes though,

5007
02:12:58,751 --> 02:12:59,584
man.

5008
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:00,880
I think that's a real issue.

5009
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:03,790
I stand up Comedians
icehouse needs one for sure.

5010
02:13:03,820 --> 02:13:04,420
Yeah.

5011
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:05,253
But um,

5012
02:13:05,290 --> 02:13:10,150
it's a real issue to have a
developing class of upcoming guys.

5013
02:13:10,210 --> 02:13:14,350
Like there's only a few clubs that
develop people from the ground up.

5014
02:13:14,830 --> 02:13:15,730
The laugh factory.

5015
02:13:15,731 --> 02:13:16,564
Good luck.

5016
02:13:16,650 --> 02:13:18,340
You've got to wait in line on Tuesday.

5017
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:21,410
You got to get there at
9:00 AM and sign up shit.

5018
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:24,940
And then they put your material on
youtube without telling you fucking,

5019
02:13:24,941 --> 02:13:25,241
I was like,

5020
02:13:25,241 --> 02:13:25,930
thanks.

5021
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:26,590
What the fuck?

5022
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:27,010
Well,

5023
02:13:27,010 --> 02:13:28,120
it's a good place to work out.

5024
02:13:28,210 --> 02:13:29,410
He doesn't put my shit up there.

5025
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:29,770
Yeah,

5026
02:13:29,770 --> 02:13:30,071
of course.

5027
02:13:30,071 --> 02:13:32,490
But it's because I told them not to.

5028
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:33,630
They were going to,

5029
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:34,590
you know,

5030
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:36,060
he wanted to and I said,

5031
02:13:36,061 --> 02:13:36,421
you can't.

5032
02:13:36,421 --> 02:13:36,721
No,

5033
02:13:36,721 --> 02:13:37,860
no filming me know,

5034
02:13:37,861 --> 02:13:38,880
but don't put it on the air.

5035
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:39,570
Come on man.

5036
02:13:39,570 --> 02:13:40,680
I know somebody that was like,

5037
02:13:40,681 --> 02:13:41,161
look dude,

5038
02:13:41,161 --> 02:13:42,060
that's not cool.

5039
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:43,410
Put Take my material.

5040
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:43,820
Yeah.

5041
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:45,870
They took it down and then the
following week they put it back up.

5042
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:47,450
I'm not surprised.

5043
02:13:47,570 --> 02:13:48,260
Yeah.

5044
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:49,190
I'm not surprised.

5045
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:51,170
They probably make you sign some shit.

5046
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:52,490
Did you go to the Improv last night?

5047
02:13:52,730 --> 02:13:53,090
No.

5048
02:13:53,090 --> 02:13:53,850
What was it?

5049
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:54,030
No,

5050
02:13:54,030 --> 02:13:56,510
it's the last night
that that bar was open.

5051
02:13:56,690 --> 02:13:57,523
That what bar?

5052
02:13:57,650 --> 02:13:59,090
That bar in the front there.

5053
02:13:59,270 --> 02:14:01,280
They're tearing all that
down and making it a steak.

5054
02:14:01,410 --> 02:14:02,270
Steak House or something?

5055
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:03,340
Yeah,

5056
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:06,980
they have a new bar that's in
the back of the club I guess,

5057
02:14:06,981 --> 02:14:11,170
and I've extended it and they tore down
the stage two and it's going to be a

5058
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:13,160
weird decision making there though.

5059
02:14:13,190 --> 02:14:14,460
So whoa.

5060
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:15,090
What?

5061
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:15,923
What they're doing?

5062
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:16,651
Well,

5063
02:14:16,651 --> 02:14:20,250
maybe they feel like they could
do good money as a steakhouse.

5064
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:21,920
They actually have really good food there.

5065
02:14:21,921 --> 02:14:23,040
I was going to be the same kitchen.

5066
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:23,831
No,

5067
02:14:23,831 --> 02:14:24,191
I think,

5068
02:14:24,191 --> 02:14:25,024
I think there's,

5069
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:28,510
it's either that they're
franchising a place out,

5070
02:14:28,780 --> 02:14:30,580
which is what I heard originally,

5071
02:14:30,790 --> 02:14:32,410
but then last night I heard a steak house,

5072
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:33,790
so maybe they're just trying to like,

5073
02:14:33,791 --> 02:14:34,001
hey,

5074
02:14:34,001 --> 02:14:34,680
let's,

5075
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:35,080
I would like,

5076
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:36,640
I would eat there every
day if it was a steakhouse

5077
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,140
Fleming's or something like that.

5078
02:14:38,141 --> 02:14:39,690
Like open the front to a steakhouse.

5079
02:14:39,870 --> 02:14:40,570
Right.

5080
02:14:40,570 --> 02:14:41,950
That's a bad ass idea.

5081
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:42,820
You know?

5082
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:46,300
That's a great move though to have a
nice restaurant right next to a comedy

5083
02:14:46,301 --> 02:14:46,870
club.

5084
02:14:46,870 --> 02:14:48,820
We can come in and say
there's a nine o'clock show,

5085
02:14:48,821 --> 02:14:49,840
you go in at seven,

5086
02:14:49,841 --> 02:14:52,900
have a nice meal and then go
right over and watch a show

5087
02:14:52,970 --> 02:14:54,320
or just having a good kitchen.

5088
02:14:54,321 --> 02:14:54,651
And you know,

5089
02:14:54,651 --> 02:14:57,980
like some of these comedy clubs are just
like fried everything or that you look

5090
02:14:57,981 --> 02:14:58,701
at the Ice House,

5091
02:14:58,701 --> 02:15:00,170
they actually have like
chefs there that are like,

5092
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:00,411
oh no,

5093
02:15:00,411 --> 02:15:00,940
this is actually

5094
02:15:00,940 --> 02:15:03,020
right dude from the ice house.

5095
02:15:03,021 --> 02:15:04,440
It was fucking jam.

5096
02:15:04,460 --> 02:15:05,750
It was really good.

5097
02:15:05,751 --> 02:15:06,440
It was good.

5098
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:06,651
Yeah.

5099
02:15:06,651 --> 02:15:07,940
The ice house is bad ass.

5100
02:15:08,030 --> 02:15:08,863
It's,

5101
02:15:08,900 --> 02:15:09,550
you know,

5102
02:15:09,550 --> 02:15:10,241
there,

5103
02:15:10,241 --> 02:15:11,840
there's only like me,

5104
02:15:12,130 --> 02:15:12,411
I mean,

5105
02:15:12,411 --> 02:15:16,190
how many clubs are there in southern
California have good food that,

5106
02:15:16,191 --> 02:15:16,340
uh,

5107
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:17,510
are also comedy clubs,

5108
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:18,200
flags,

5109
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:20,030
sounds flappers has great food.

5110
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:21,230
Um,

5111
02:15:21,230 --> 02:15:21,980
the Improv,

5112
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:23,300
almost all of them have good food.

5113
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:24,440
They all have good food.

5114
02:15:24,470 --> 02:15:27,560
They all have like a decent
meg at the very least decent.

5115
02:15:27,561 --> 02:15:28,070
Right.

5116
02:15:28,070 --> 02:15:28,903
You know,

5117
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:31,310
that's such a great idea.

5118
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:31,941
Like I don't,

5119
02:15:31,941 --> 02:15:33,320
I'm obviously not,

5120
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:34,790
not a non comedian,

5121
02:15:34,791 --> 02:15:38,870
but if I was a non comedian and that
was a job where I can have a meal and go

5122
02:15:38,871 --> 02:15:40,400
somewhere and go see a comedy show,

5123
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:42,020
fuck what an awesome night.

5124
02:15:42,290 --> 02:15:42,531
You know,

5125
02:15:42,531 --> 02:15:44,000
especially if like you can go see someone.

5126
02:15:44,001 --> 02:15:44,834
That's good.

5127
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:47,210
Yeah.

5128
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:49,670
We were having this conversation
about how many standup comedians are,

5129
02:15:49,671 --> 02:15:51,350
are and uh,

5130
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:52,613
think it was,

5131
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:56,530
maybe it was me and [inaudible]
me and some other comic.

5132
02:15:56,810 --> 02:15:57,830
We're trying to figure it out.

5133
02:15:58,040 --> 02:16:02,390
And we started out by saying
this probably like all together,

5134
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:07,720
like maybe 2000 in the whole country
that are professional comedians.

5135
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:10,020
Let that go on the road and everything.

5136
02:16:10,021 --> 02:16:10,460
Yeah,

5137
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:10,680
yeah.

5138
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:11,580
Thinking about 2000,

5139
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:12,810
I would say 2000.

5140
02:16:12,811 --> 02:16:13,021
Yeah,

5141
02:16:13,021 --> 02:16:13,291
that's,

5142
02:16:13,291 --> 02:16:13,781
that's a good note.

5143
02:16:13,781 --> 02:16:13,921
I mean,

5144
02:16:13,921 --> 02:16:15,060
there was a live open micros,

5145
02:16:15,061 --> 02:16:15,841
but you can't count those.

5146
02:16:15,841 --> 02:16:19,170
But if you're talking about even the
smaller guys that are still going on the

5147
02:16:19,171 --> 02:16:21,180
road playing a couple of clubs
are doing a couple of things,

5148
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:26,400
2000 unless you count like maybe like
some guys that do like the college

5149
02:16:26,401 --> 02:16:26,821
circuit,

5150
02:16:26,821 --> 02:16:30,130
which they're only playing
bars and college areas you
and like not real comics,

5151
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:32,200
but they sell themselves
as comics or something.

5152
02:16:32,201 --> 02:16:33,034
You know?

5153
02:16:33,130 --> 02:16:37,700
I bet there's like this whole group of
comics that aren't in the comic knee

5154
02:16:37,701 --> 02:16:41,320
circle at all that goes though,

5155
02:16:41,321 --> 02:16:41,531
right?

5156
02:16:41,531 --> 02:16:41,771
Yeah,

5157
02:16:41,771 --> 02:16:42,400
I guess so.

5158
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:43,810
They just don't hang out with us.

5159
02:16:43,811 --> 02:16:44,500
Right.

5160
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:45,333
I mean,

5161
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:46,930
at a certain point in time,

5162
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:47,621
you know,

5163
02:16:47,621 --> 02:16:49,090
a lot of comics become,

5164
02:16:49,420 --> 02:16:50,800
they just become like
theater actually like,

5165
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:51,251
okay,

5166
02:16:51,251 --> 02:16:52,390
here's a perfect example.

5167
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:53,380
Brian Regan,

5168
02:16:53,770 --> 02:16:54,700
hilarious guy,

5169
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:55,870
brilliant comedian.

5170
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:58,750
When was the last time you saw Brian
Regan come to a comedy club and fuck

5171
02:16:58,751 --> 02:16:59,584
around?

5172
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:00,190
You know?

5173
02:17:00,190 --> 02:17:00,700
Yeah,

5174
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:00,930
no,

5175
02:17:00,930 --> 02:17:01,750
we never see him,

5176
02:17:01,750 --> 02:17:03,070
but he does these big theaters.

5177
02:17:03,071 --> 02:17:04,240
He sells out theaters.

5178
02:17:04,540 --> 02:17:06,880
And so I think he just
does all of his writing.

5179
02:17:07,090 --> 02:17:07,540
Uh,

5180
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:11,380
and knows what's funny and what's not
and just works it into his act as you

5181
02:17:11,381 --> 02:17:11,621
know,

5182
02:17:11,621 --> 02:17:13,870
as he doesn't mean these
theaters I was talking to,

5183
02:17:14,050 --> 02:17:15,950
we had Jim Florentine on
a podcast the other day.

5184
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:17,013
He's a great guy.

5185
02:17:17,240 --> 02:17:18,790
I'm going to be working with him tonight.

5186
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:19,400
Awesome.

5187
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:19,900
Uh,

5188
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:20,681
and he,

5189
02:17:20,681 --> 02:17:20,891
uh,

5190
02:17:20,891 --> 02:17:22,930
he was talking about how uh,

5191
02:17:23,170 --> 02:17:23,441
what's,

5192
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:24,730
what's the guy from uh,

5193
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:28,960
east coast that a really
funny comic comic,

5194
02:17:28,961 --> 02:17:30,280
but he doesn't like to fly.

5195
02:17:30,281 --> 02:17:35,281
So he doesn't do any west coast
shows that we talked about it model?

5196
02:17:35,660 --> 02:17:35,850
No,

5197
02:17:35,850 --> 02:17:36,161
no.

5198
02:17:36,161 --> 02:17:36,790
Uh,

5199
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:41,790
the one that might be a works Mike be a,

5200
02:17:42,130 --> 02:17:42,311
yeah,

5201
02:17:42,311 --> 02:17:43,950
they might be DePaul like DePaul.

5202
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:45,010
He doesn't like to fly.

5203
02:17:45,011 --> 02:17:47,950
I guess Nick Depalo doesn't go
like he did go past Chicago.

5204
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:49,250
He doesn't fly past Chicago's,

5205
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:52,300
he only does clubs on
that side of Chicago.

5206
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:53,433
And uh,

5207
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:53,921
cause I was like,

5208
02:17:53,921 --> 02:17:56,830
why don't I ever see nick
the Po like him anywhere.

5209
02:17:56,860 --> 02:17:57,970
I never see him anywhere,

5210
02:17:58,090 --> 02:18:00,140
but just because I don't live
on that side of Chicago anyway.

5211
02:18:00,310 --> 02:18:00,970
So,

5212
02:18:00,970 --> 02:18:01,570
but uh,

5213
02:18:01,570 --> 02:18:02,920
that's somebody I would like to see,

5214
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:03,520
you know,

5215
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:04,750
like start touring around.

5216
02:18:04,750 --> 02:18:09,130
He should also do a fucking podcast
cause Nigga nick did a radio show with

5217
02:18:09,131 --> 02:18:11,680
already lang and does he do a podcast now?

5218
02:18:11,710 --> 02:18:13,240
I think he's still does nick?

5219
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:16,180
Look Nick should never
be on regular radio.

5220
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:19,150
I mean he should be a
guest on regular radio.

5221
02:18:19,151 --> 02:18:21,760
Like you know if he has to do
Howard stern or something like that,

5222
02:18:21,761 --> 02:18:22,690
absolutely do it.

5223
02:18:23,050 --> 02:18:28,050
But Nick is a guy who you want completely
uncensored and the fact that he was

5224
02:18:28,871 --> 02:18:30,040
doing that Artie Lange show,

5225
02:18:30,041 --> 02:18:32,350
I would watch it sometimes on direct TV.

5226
02:18:32,660 --> 02:18:33,250
I was like I,

5227
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:36,040
I know he has to hold back
here like he shouldn't,

5228
02:18:36,190 --> 02:18:39,490
he has to be in an environment
where there's zero holding back.

5229
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:40,001
You know,

5230
02:18:40,001 --> 02:18:40,900
just let them,

5231
02:18:40,930 --> 02:18:45,190
let them rant and let him say what he
wants whenever he wants to said he's

5232
02:18:45,191 --> 02:18:45,940
hilarious.

5233
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:49,480
He is like really right wing
beliefs about a lot of shit that I,

5234
02:18:49,481 --> 02:18:49,811
you know,

5235
02:18:49,811 --> 02:18:53,740
some of it I don't even agree with but
I think it's fucking funny as hell.

5236
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:58,000
But you're never going to get
those on a regular radio show.

5237
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:01,480
You just not going to these like some,

5238
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:05,800
some guys get stuck in a situation where
the very thing that makes them awesome

5239
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:08,050
is the thing they can't do when,

5240
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:09,130
when they're on the job,

5241
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:10,360
you know,

5242
02:19:10,360 --> 02:19:12,010
like being offensive,

5243
02:19:12,011 --> 02:19:13,330
saying ridiculous shit,

5244
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:16,720
swearing and being real
sexual or whatever it is.

5245
02:19:16,721 --> 02:19:20,110
It's funny that you're talking about
you can't do that if you're on a regular

5246
02:19:20,111 --> 02:19:20,771
radio show,

5247
02:19:20,771 --> 02:19:22,030
you literally can't do it.

5248
02:19:22,870 --> 02:19:23,201
You know,

5249
02:19:23,201 --> 02:19:25,360
like you're so limited.

5250
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:26,080
Like the,

5251
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:28,100
like the way they would
to describe things,

5252
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:30,680
I would watch them like dance
around bad words and shit.

5253
02:19:30,681 --> 02:19:30,981
I was like,

5254
02:19:30,981 --> 02:19:31,431
God,

5255
02:19:31,431 --> 02:19:32,780
this is so pathetic.

5256
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:34,610
It's like a slave gig.

5257
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:35,541
It's like you're,

5258
02:19:35,541 --> 02:19:35,781
you're,

5259
02:19:35,781 --> 02:19:36,021
you're,

5260
02:19:36,021 --> 02:19:38,150
you're censoring yourself.

5261
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:39,110
You,

5262
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:39,411
you're,

5263
02:19:39,411 --> 02:19:40,011
you're talking,

5264
02:19:40,011 --> 02:19:40,701
you're ad libbing.

5265
02:19:40,701 --> 02:19:41,151
But you know,

5266
02:19:41,151 --> 02:19:42,080
you can't say this and know.

5267
02:19:42,081 --> 02:19:43,430
You can't say that there's rules,

5268
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:45,020
there's rules to this gig.

5269
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:46,550
I'm a,

5270
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:47,840
I'm on the radio talking,

5271
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:48,890
but I can't be me.

5272
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:49,800
Right.

5273
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:50,930
I can't fully be me.

5274
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:53,660
Can't use all my words because if I do,

5275
02:19:53,661 --> 02:19:55,160
everyone's going to get so sad.

5276
02:19:55,490 --> 02:19:57,230
He's gonna make certain
sounds with his mouth.

5277
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:58,640
They're going to really piss people off.

5278
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:01,160
And it's weird thing because it's not,

5279
02:20:01,161 --> 02:20:06,161
it's an intense thing because you can
say a word that means exactly the same

5280
02:20:07,551 --> 02:20:08,000
thing.

5281
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:08,930
Like you can say,

5282
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:14,140
apparently a woman was arrested because
she was having sex with men and then

5283
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:18,020
while she,

5284
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:18,410
uh,

5285
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:20,690
let them put her penis inside her vagina,

5286
02:20:20,691 --> 02:20:22,040
she would start biting their face.

5287
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:24,163
You could say that,

5288
02:20:24,290 --> 02:20:26,780
but you couldn't say this crazy bitch.

5289
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:27,921
What she did do,

5290
02:20:27,921 --> 02:20:29,510
she would fuck these guys in the moment.

5291
02:20:29,511 --> 02:20:30,650
They stuck their cock in her.

5292
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:32,660
She would bite down on their face.

5293
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:34,213
You couldn't say that,

5294
02:20:34,550 --> 02:20:35,720
but that's the right way to say it.

5295
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:36,750
You know?

5296
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:37,990
I mean you could say having sex with,

5297
02:20:38,010 --> 02:20:40,670
but what if you wanted to
say stuck your cock in her.

5298
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:41,870
You should be able to say that too.

5299
02:20:42,330 --> 02:20:43,550
Like it's the same goddamn thing.

5300
02:20:43,551 --> 02:20:44,960
You have the same image in your mind.

5301
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:46,070
Exactly.

5302
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:48,200
But one of them can
get you thrown in jail.

5303
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:50,990
One of them get you like a
quarter million dollar fine.

5304
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:52,713
Not only that,

5305
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:54,140
you could say that word.

5306
02:20:54,470 --> 02:20:55,670
You got to say it in a different way.

5307
02:20:55,671 --> 02:20:59,270
Like you could say cock a doodle Doo and
you can say it on the radio and no one

5308
02:20:59,271 --> 02:21:00,500
could say a goddamn thing.

5309
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:04,670
You could say pussy cat and no
one could say a God damn thing.

5310
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:09,020
You could have a nice little pause in
there pussy cat and no one could do

5311
02:21:09,021 --> 02:21:09,720
anything.

5312
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:10,850
It's nothing you did wrong.

5313
02:21:11,250 --> 02:21:12,290
You can't go to jail.

5314
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:14,180
We are apes.

5315
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:16,490
We are so fucking stupid.

5316
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:20,720
As a culture like that is one of the
dumbest fucking things about people today.

5317
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:22,700
The bad word thing,

5318
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:25,220
it's unbelievable that
that's still around.

5319
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:26,090
I mean,

5320
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:26,510
and it's,

5321
02:21:26,510 --> 02:21:30,440
it's so ridiculous that it's one of
those things that because it's around it

5322
02:21:30,441 --> 02:21:32,210
because it's so silly and
we all have to follow it.

5323
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:36,920
It makes us more prone to
following ridiculous rules.

5324
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:39,170
It makes us easier to govern I think.

5325
02:21:39,171 --> 02:21:43,520
I think it makes us easier to control
because if you can get people to not swear

5326
02:21:43,521 --> 02:21:44,540
all day at work,

5327
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:45,340
you're going to the,

5328
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:45,531
you know,

5329
02:21:45,531 --> 02:21:46,101
on the job,

5330
02:21:46,101 --> 02:21:46,281
you know,

5331
02:21:46,281 --> 02:21:46,790
I don't swim.

5332
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:49,670
I'd say sort of why the coffee or the
truck up a bumper on that fucking broad.

5333
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:49,991
He don't,

5334
02:21:49,991 --> 02:21:52,910
he might say something like that while
you're going get a cup of coffee in the

5335
02:21:52,911 --> 02:21:53,301
kitchen,

5336
02:21:53,301 --> 02:21:54,680
but it'd be completely inappropriate.

5337
02:21:54,890 --> 02:21:56,600
And it's limited to dark,

5338
02:21:56,601 --> 02:21:57,980
shadowy areas when no one's around.

5339
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:01,490
But the fact that you
don't do it every day,

5340
02:22:01,491 --> 02:22:01,930
all the day,

5341
02:22:01,930 --> 02:22:03,860
you can't always be free with your,

5342
02:22:04,130 --> 02:22:05,090
the way you communicate,

5343
02:22:05,091 --> 02:22:06,950
you're trying to portray
something at work.

5344
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:08,870
You want to have a professional image.

5345
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:10,550
You can't use those words.

5346
02:22:10,551 --> 02:22:13,580
I'm more likely to buy a car
or something from a guy swears,

5347
02:22:14,890 --> 02:22:15,723
you know,

5348
02:22:15,950 --> 02:22:17,210
if I think I can hang out with them,

5349
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:17,751
he's like,

5350
02:22:17,751 --> 02:22:18,850
he's gonna talk to yeah,

5351
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:24,670
some fucking Weirdo and wants to tell
me about the various features and can't

5352
02:22:24,681 --> 02:22:25,980
even throw a shit or a fucking

5353
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,610
there.

5354
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:27,420
Come on now.

5355
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:27,960
Yeah.

5356
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:31,350
I would always say [inaudible]
it gets fucking cold.

5357
02:22:31,351 --> 02:22:32,190
That's what I'm talking about,

5358
02:22:32,191 --> 02:22:33,024
man.

5359
02:22:33,490 --> 02:22:34,950
Some places it's a little weird.

5360
02:22:34,951 --> 02:22:36,120
I got this guy at cvs,

5361
02:22:36,121 --> 02:22:38,190
I was buying beer and uh,

5362
02:22:38,380 --> 02:22:40,530
it was Miller high life and it was
like people behind me and stuff.

5363
02:22:40,531 --> 02:22:41,220
And he goes,

5364
02:22:41,220 --> 02:22:41,491
dude,

5365
02:22:41,491 --> 02:22:44,460
I've always been saying when that'd be
cool if they actually had weed in this

5366
02:22:44,461 --> 02:22:45,090
beer.

5367
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:45,421
And I'm like,

5368
02:22:45,421 --> 02:22:45,721
dude,

5369
02:22:45,721 --> 02:22:45,901
you're,

5370
02:22:45,901 --> 02:22:47,000
you work at CVS,

5371
02:22:47,030 --> 02:22:48,750
please don't talk like this.

5372
02:22:48,751 --> 02:22:50,040
And like it was really uncomfortable.

5373
02:22:50,210 --> 02:22:50,491
I'm like,

5374
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:52,320
I just wanted to like cvs or not.

5375
02:22:52,321 --> 02:22:55,680
So I would like you to be professional
right now and not address me as if you're

5376
02:22:55,730 --> 02:22:58,710
a normal person because this is where I
buy medicine and I want you to be like

5377
02:22:58,711 --> 02:22:59,030
that.

5378
02:22:59,030 --> 02:23:03,450
I know I'm buying my Miller high
life medicine Miller high life.

5379
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:05,480
That's not a good taste beer.

5380
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:05,701
No,

5381
02:23:05,701 --> 02:23:06,421
it's a great beer.

5382
02:23:06,421 --> 02:23:08,310
It's the champagne when you're on drugs.

5383
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:10,380
Ever had more high life.

5384
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:12,000
I you don't want to
listen to the other day,

5385
02:23:12,001 --> 02:23:12,900
the Roth Show,

5386
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:13,823
David Lee Roth,

5387
02:23:14,070 --> 02:23:14,790
our good friend,

5388
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:15,250
by the way.

5389
02:23:15,250 --> 02:23:15,590
Yeah,

5390
02:23:15,590 --> 02:23:16,423
we're allowed to say that.

5391
02:23:16,660 --> 02:23:19,190
We talked to him for
fucking hours with them.

5392
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:20,641
David Lee Ross,

5393
02:23:20,641 --> 02:23:21,451
the coolest man on earth.

5394
02:23:21,451 --> 02:23:25,440
We've actually in total to talk to that
guy almost probably like five hours

5395
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:26,533
because that,

5396
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:27,331
well,

5397
02:23:27,331 --> 02:23:29,640
the comedy store tonight was even
weirder because we weren't filming.

5398
02:23:29,641 --> 02:23:30,510
He was just hanging out.

5399
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:31,750
But that's how cool he is.

5400
02:23:31,810 --> 02:23:33,210
But you weren't filming
and have it all on tape.

5401
02:23:33,830 --> 02:23:36,370
But I'm saying we didn't have a camera.

5402
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:36,720
You know,

5403
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:40,890
we didn't have like some gigantic set
up like this where he knew he was on a

5404
02:23:40,891 --> 02:23:41,724
podcast,

5405
02:23:41,910 --> 02:23:43,500
but I was watching his podcast,

5406
02:23:43,501 --> 02:23:44,334
the bra show,

5407
02:23:44,430 --> 02:23:45,960
which is pretty fucking funny man.

5408
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:46,621
First of all,

5409
02:23:46,621 --> 02:23:49,920
he does it all in overalls
like he does his podcast.

5410
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:52,410
And overall he wore overalls
on this in here too.

5411
02:23:52,411 --> 02:23:56,310
And he did the podcast fell he
wears now what do you eat it?

5412
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:57,840
Where do you buy two of us.

5413
02:23:57,841 --> 02:23:58,381
And you're eating?

5414
02:23:58,381 --> 02:23:59,040
What are you doing?

5415
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:00,330
I'm trying to eat my breakfast.

5416
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:01,830
I'm getting trail mix.

5417
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:02,820
Trail mix.

5418
02:24:03,670 --> 02:24:04,490
Um,

5419
02:24:04,490 --> 02:24:08,990
but he was talking about beers and
a that he loves like Budweiser.

5420
02:24:08,991 --> 02:24:09,401
He likes it.

5421
02:24:09,401 --> 02:24:12,140
Tasted Budweiser because
when he drinks like these,

5422
02:24:12,470 --> 02:24:16,210
like organic beers or micro
brews or what have you,

5423
02:24:16,380 --> 02:24:16,570
you,

5424
02:24:16,570 --> 02:24:19,580
he said you're missing a
little bit of a nuclear waste.

5425
02:24:19,940 --> 02:24:20,773
You're missing a little bit.

5426
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:22,580
So there's a chemical taste.

5427
02:24:22,581 --> 02:24:23,870
It's just missing from that.

5428
02:24:24,130 --> 02:24:24,840
Well,

5429
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:25,631
it tastes like what you,

5430
02:24:25,631 --> 02:24:27,580
you grew up thinking
beer tastes like a beer.

5431
02:24:27,581 --> 02:24:31,300
Had like growing up there was just
light beer and beer for the most part.

5432
02:24:31,301 --> 02:24:33,430
There wasn't that much
fancy stuff going on.

5433
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:33,990
Fucking

5434
02:24:33,990 --> 02:24:36,060
stuff that I have here that um,

5435
02:24:36,090 --> 02:24:38,550
what is it Jamie black Butte porter.

5436
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:39,840
Who makes that shit?

5437
02:24:40,050 --> 02:24:40,830
Do you remember?

5438
02:24:40,830 --> 02:24:41,220
Some,

5439
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:42,300
some micro brew,

5440
02:24:42,301 --> 02:24:43,134
some Small Cup.

5441
02:24:43,290 --> 02:24:45,240
It's the best taste in beer
I've ever had in my life.

5442
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:46,320
It's delicious.

5443
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:46,920
It's a,

5444
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:47,850
it's like chocolate.

5445
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:50,100
I mean like it's so good.

5446
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:52,290
It's like that but better.

5447
02:24:52,390 --> 02:24:53,041
It tastes better.

5448
02:24:53,041 --> 02:24:53,580
It's like,

5449
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:55,860
it's like a lighter Guinness
but it's like Guinness.

5450
02:24:56,100 --> 02:24:57,120
But I had it,

5451
02:24:57,121 --> 02:24:58,740
I had a steak one night
and I have that shit.

5452
02:24:58,741 --> 02:24:59,280
I was like,

5453
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:00,830
this is the best beer I've ever done.

5454
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:02,610
I've never had a beer that's so tasty.

5455
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:03,480
It was,

5456
02:25:03,480 --> 02:25:04,350
it's incredible.

5457
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:08,910
And I didn't think anything of all
those micro brews before that day before

5458
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:08,910
though,

5459
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:09,540
that day I just didn't,

5460
02:25:09,540 --> 02:25:10,373
I didn't think,

5461
02:25:10,470 --> 02:25:10,771
I'm like,

5462
02:25:10,771 --> 02:25:11,520
it's beer,

5463
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:12,120
it's beer.

5464
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:12,953
I like beer.

5465
02:25:12,990 --> 02:25:13,950
But I like Heineken.

5466
02:25:13,990 --> 02:25:15,390
Heineken's delicious to me.

5467
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:15,900
If I'm,

5468
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:19,080
if I'm eating something and I
can get a nice cold Heineken,

5469
02:25:19,081 --> 02:25:20,550
I think Heineken tastes fucking great,

5470
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:24,180
but I didn't think that like a
micro would be a totally different

5471
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:25,013
sort of experience.

5472
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:26,340
But some of them are,

5473
02:25:26,341 --> 02:25:26,970
man,

5474
02:25:26,970 --> 02:25:30,180
there's some bad ass mother fuckers
out there and making some crazy beer.

5475
02:25:30,270 --> 02:25:32,890
My friend Shane is just one like Columbia,

5476
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:35,820
the won first place in this
big beer thing and now this,

5477
02:25:36,770 --> 02:25:40,460
now this local bar is serving his beer
all year because he won first place.

5478
02:25:40,490 --> 02:25:41,061
Holy Shit.

5479
02:25:41,061 --> 02:25:42,170
Chains of beer mogul.

5480
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:42,351
Yeah,

5481
02:25:42,351 --> 02:25:42,650
he's been,

5482
02:25:42,650 --> 02:25:44,110
he started in his basement.

5483
02:25:44,130 --> 02:25:45,540
He's been doing it for
awhile and then he has like,

5484
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:49,590
he built his own bar in his basement
with all has his own beers in it.

5485
02:25:49,591 --> 02:25:49,730
Yeah.

5486
02:25:49,730 --> 02:25:50,900
That's hilarious.

5487
02:25:50,901 --> 02:25:51,590
Cool.

5488
02:25:51,590 --> 02:25:53,030
Can you get him to sell us on?

5489
02:25:53,060 --> 02:25:54,200
Well he sell us some beer.

5490
02:25:54,310 --> 02:25:54,680
Oh sure.

5491
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:55,401
Can you ship it?

5492
02:25:55,401 --> 02:25:56,120
Can you ship it?

5493
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:56,900
Sure.

5494
02:25:56,900 --> 02:25:58,040
He can bottle it and everything.

5495
02:25:58,041 --> 02:25:58,820
He does the whole deal.

5496
02:25:58,820 --> 02:25:59,270
Yeah.

5497
02:25:59,270 --> 02:25:59,750
Dude,

5498
02:25:59,750 --> 02:26:00,890
let's get a tap.

5499
02:26:01,370 --> 02:26:03,290
Let's get a keg here with Shane's beer.

5500
02:26:03,291 --> 02:26:04,160
Can he make a keg?

5501
02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:05,000
Probably.

5502
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,200
How does it mean how's he ship it?

5503
02:26:06,360 --> 02:26:06,831
Because you don't know.

5504
02:26:06,831 --> 02:26:07,850
How does he sell it to them?

5505
02:26:07,870 --> 02:26:09,620
I would have to ask
him if he's even do it.

5506
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:10,760
The reason why I'm saying it's like he's,

5507
02:26:10,761 --> 02:26:12,170
if he's selling it to restaurants,

5508
02:26:12,171 --> 02:26:13,440
he must be right.

5509
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:15,040
Giving them a CAG or
sorry if they're on it.

5510
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:17,600
If I see the,

5511
02:26:17,660 --> 02:26:22,000
what's that bar in Columbus like brew
Brewery Barney [inaudible] parties.

5512
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:22,730
But uh,

5513
02:26:22,730 --> 02:26:23,780
the one that right there on high street,

5514
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:24,380
uh,

5515
02:26:24,380 --> 02:26:24,801
there's a,

5516
02:26:24,801 --> 02:26:26,270
there's a brewery that it's,

5517
02:26:26,300 --> 02:26:26,660
it's,

5518
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:27,291
they're selling it.

5519
02:26:27,291 --> 02:26:29,900
So they might be actually
brewing it at the bars.

5520
02:26:29,901 --> 02:26:30,310
Like,

5521
02:26:30,310 --> 02:26:30,650
Shit,

5522
02:26:30,650 --> 02:26:31,690
I wish I knew the name of it.

5523
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:32,713
Huh?

5524
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:33,501
Oh,

5525
02:26:33,501 --> 02:26:36,590
so it's one of those places where they're
making it in the establishment and

5526
02:26:36,591 --> 02:26:37,730
then chilling it right there.

5527
02:26:37,731 --> 02:26:39,050
So there's no travel at all.

5528
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:41,540
Oh No,

5529
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:42,310
no.

5530
02:26:42,310 --> 02:26:44,020
Barley's barley's brewing company.

5531
02:26:44,021 --> 02:26:44,680
I think it's wearing it.

5532
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:46,090
That's a real popular thing now.

5533
02:26:46,091 --> 02:26:47,140
And I swear to God,

5534
02:26:47,141 --> 02:26:49,120
until I had this black Butte porter,

5535
02:26:49,150 --> 02:26:49,631
whatever the hell,

5536
02:26:49,631 --> 02:26:53,080
and I promise you probably should
fucking say the name of it for these guys

5537
02:26:53,170 --> 02:26:55,210
because it's so God damn delicious.

5538
02:26:55,510 --> 02:26:56,141
Let me find it.

5539
02:26:56,141 --> 02:26:58,480
It's in my Instagram bitch.

5540
02:26:59,130 --> 02:26:59,461
Yeah.

5541
02:26:59,461 --> 02:27:00,001
Here's a,

5542
02:27:00,001 --> 02:27:01,410
here's actually Shane winning.

5543
02:27:01,411 --> 02:27:01,830
Uh,

5544
02:27:01,830 --> 02:27:06,470
here's the photos aren't barley's company
and as Shane and his friend and uh,

5545
02:27:07,870 --> 02:27:08,703
yeah.

5546
02:27:09,560 --> 02:27:09,990
Anyways.

5547
02:27:09,990 --> 02:27:10,823
What is the name of his,

5548
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:11,630
his beer?

5549
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:12,060
Uh,

5550
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:12,831
let me try to find it.

5551
02:27:12,831 --> 02:27:13,664
Yeah,

5552
02:27:13,950 --> 02:27:14,740
I'll find it.

5553
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:15,573
Labor guys.

5554
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:18,270
I can't quit Instagram now.

5555
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:19,370
Oh,

5556
02:27:19,370 --> 02:27:19,701
hi.

5557
02:27:19,701 --> 02:27:20,600
Optic nerve.

5558
02:27:20,670 --> 02:27:21,503
I,

5559
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:22,180
yeah,

5560
02:27:22,180 --> 02:27:22,750
that's a great,

5561
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:23,583
great name.

5562
02:27:23,950 --> 02:27:24,730
Yeah.

5563
02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:26,650
I can't quit Instagram,

5564
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:27,573
but uh,

5565
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:30,040
sometimes I do wonder
what the hell I'm doing.

5566
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:32,021
Oh.

5567
02:27:32,021 --> 02:27:32,321
And their,

5568
02:27:32,321 --> 02:27:34,390
their tap is a big eyeball.

5569
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:36,820
It's a big eyeball.

5570
02:27:36,850 --> 02:27:37,510
Yeah.

5571
02:27:37,510 --> 02:27:37,781
You know,

5572
02:27:37,781 --> 02:27:39,010
like the things that they pour,

5573
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:41,020
like they hold down on it
and it's just a big eyeball.

5574
02:27:43,350 --> 02:27:43,770
Okay.

5575
02:27:43,770 --> 02:27:45,300
Just as black Butte porter,

5576
02:27:45,350 --> 02:27:45,710
Cath.

5577
02:27:45,710 --> 02:27:46,543
Dammit.

5578
02:27:47,930 --> 02:27:48,201
Yeah.

5579
02:27:48,201 --> 02:27:48,300
I,

5580
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:48,461
I,

5581
02:27:48,461 --> 02:27:49,294
I'm a,

5582
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:52,220
I'm more of a fan of Jack Daniel's lately,

5583
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:54,590
which is a horrible thing
because I just got into Jack.

5584
02:27:54,690 --> 02:27:57,320
I was like the last year of my life,

5585
02:27:57,321 --> 02:27:59,120
I've never been in a Jack Daniels and,

5586
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:03,050
but now I just only liked to drink jack
and I don't even like drinking beer

5587
02:28:03,051 --> 02:28:03,411
anymore,

5588
02:28:03,411 --> 02:28:05,610
but I'm trying to force myself to go back.

5589
02:28:05,611 --> 02:28:05,870
Right.

5590
02:28:05,870 --> 02:28:06,410
This is,

5591
02:28:06,410 --> 02:28:07,280
this is the beer.

5592
02:28:07,281 --> 02:28:09,080
It's Deschutes brewery,

5593
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:09,861
d,

5594
02:28:09,861 --> 02:28:12,440
s c h,

5595
02:28:12,441 --> 02:28:14,300
u t e s brewery,

5596
02:28:14,810 --> 02:28:15,980
and there's a on my Instagram,

5597
02:28:15,981 --> 02:28:17,000
here's a photo of one,

5598
02:28:17,001 --> 02:28:17,834
a glass of it,

5599
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:18,920
the first time I ever had it.

5600
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:24,610
So apparently now I know that there are
a lot of really interesting beers out

5601
02:28:25,031 --> 02:28:25,191
there.

5602
02:28:25,191 --> 02:28:25,490
And so now,

5603
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:29,110
because I went to another place that
had one of those like local beers on tap

5604
02:28:29,111 --> 02:28:30,790
and Austin and um,

5605
02:28:31,270 --> 02:28:31,640
I've done,

5606
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:32,471
I've done that a couple times,

5607
02:28:32,471 --> 02:28:35,050
a couple of different places and had like,

5608
02:28:35,051 --> 02:28:35,884
uh,

5609
02:28:36,310 --> 02:28:36,820
some,

5610
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:39,430
some of the local stuff and some
of it's good and some of it's okay,

5611
02:28:39,431 --> 02:28:41,830
but this stuff is pretty fucking bad eyes.

5612
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:45,550
I think there's a bunch of different
people doing a bunch of different things

5613
02:28:45,551 --> 02:28:46,970
when it comes to beer.

5614
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:47,610
No,

5615
02:28:47,610 --> 02:28:48,443
I agree.

5616
02:28:50,490 --> 02:28:51,620
I can't tell if I like Ip.

5617
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:54,290
There's a place by my house
called Tony's starts away,

5618
02:28:54,291 --> 02:28:58,460
which isn't even a dark place and they
just only sell IP address and it's just

5619
02:28:58,490 --> 02:29:00,290
all this handmade beer from California.

5620
02:29:00,291 --> 02:29:01,010
And there's like,

5621
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:01,310
I dunno,

5622
02:29:01,310 --> 02:29:05,210
like a hundred different beers and each
one is like the alcohol content and some

5623
02:29:05,211 --> 02:29:06,380
of them are like ridiculous,

5624
02:29:06,381 --> 02:29:07,190
like Lehigh,

5625
02:29:07,190 --> 02:29:08,660
like illegal,

5626
02:29:08,661 --> 02:29:08,931
you know.

5627
02:29:08,931 --> 02:29:09,764
But uh,

5628
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:10,131
I,

5629
02:29:10,131 --> 02:29:12,290
I've tried all of them
and they're all okay.

5630
02:29:12,291 --> 02:29:14,930
But I don't think like as I just
a drinking every kind of day,

5631
02:29:14,931 --> 02:29:15,500
I'm not like,

5632
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:16,490
that's how I drink.

5633
02:29:16,491 --> 02:29:20,500
I like light and easy to
drink and not Sam's drinks.

5634
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:21,260
Miller lite.

5635
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:21,531
Yeah,

5636
02:29:21,531 --> 02:29:21,831
I'm more,

5637
02:29:21,831 --> 02:29:22,820
I'm just like that.

5638
02:29:23,350 --> 02:29:23,871
I'm the same way.

5639
02:29:23,871 --> 02:29:25,440
I like Miller Light Miller high life.

5640
02:29:25,490 --> 02:29:27,590
I like no more of a Miller guy,

5641
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:30,110
Texas folk friends.

5642
02:29:30,380 --> 02:29:31,213
Shit.

5643
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:32,150
It's Kinda fucked up.

5644
02:29:32,151 --> 02:29:33,370
And one of the things I
was thinking about when,

5645
02:29:33,371 --> 02:29:33,501
when,

5646
02:29:33,501 --> 02:29:34,430
when I was in New York,

5647
02:29:34,860 --> 02:29:39,860
maybe really think about how strange it
is that California doesn't have a public

5648
02:29:40,371 --> 02:29:41,690
transportation system.

5649
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:42,891
You know,

5650
02:29:42,891 --> 02:29:45,890
when I was in New York and I was watching
all these drunk people walk down the

5651
02:29:45,891 --> 02:29:46,251
street,

5652
02:29:46,251 --> 02:29:46,641
I was like,

5653
02:29:46,641 --> 02:29:46,821
yeah,

5654
02:29:46,821 --> 02:29:47,061
you know,

5655
02:29:47,061 --> 02:29:50,570
you could just get fucked up here and
just get in the subway or take a cab.

5656
02:29:50,810 --> 02:29:51,261
You know,

5657
02:29:51,261 --> 02:29:51,921
in California,

5658
02:29:51,921 --> 02:29:52,731
if you get fucked up,

5659
02:29:52,731 --> 02:29:55,490
you're driving fucked up
or someone's driving you,

5660
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:56,180
right.

5661
02:29:56,180 --> 02:29:56,391
It's,

5662
02:29:56,391 --> 02:29:56,801
it's,

5663
02:29:56,801 --> 02:29:59,150
it's a weird thing that we don't
have a public transportation.

5664
02:29:59,450 --> 02:29:59,710
I mean,

5665
02:29:59,710 --> 02:30:00,431
we have figured it out.

5666
02:30:00,431 --> 02:30:02,440
We have buses and they
have like the subway,

5667
02:30:02,441 --> 02:30:02,981
but it's like,

5668
02:30:02,981 --> 02:30:03,814
not assignments.

5669
02:30:03,850 --> 02:30:08,120
Like I can actually go
from North Hollywood to Ho,

5670
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:08,680
uh,

5671
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:10,990
like to the Staples Center
and I've done it before,

5672
02:30:11,230 --> 02:30:11,861
but it's,

5673
02:30:11,861 --> 02:30:12,220
it's,

5674
02:30:12,220 --> 02:30:12,810
you know,

5675
02:30:12,810 --> 02:30:13,830
I have to like drive,

5676
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:18,790
ride my bike or drive to the train
station and drop it off and then go

5677
02:30:18,791 --> 02:30:19,151
underneath.

5678
02:30:19,151 --> 02:30:20,500
But it's honestly,

5679
02:30:20,530 --> 02:30:25,510
I didn't freaked out about doing some
ways in Los Angeles Weirdo vagrants in

5680
02:30:25,511 --> 02:30:27,960
fucking an earthquake.

5681
02:30:28,360 --> 02:30:28,630
Yeah.

5682
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:30,530
It's just like a big
fear of mine could the

5683
02:30:30,530 --> 02:30:31,910
people though than earth moving.

5684
02:30:32,060 --> 02:30:32,540
But yeah,

5685
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:33,910
I mean it's something
to think about though.

5686
02:30:33,930 --> 02:30:34,430
The fucking,

5687
02:30:34,430 --> 02:30:36,380
the Bart in San Francisco
is the craziest one.

5688
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:37,010
Yeah.

5689
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:38,570
That's the one that's under
the ocean in the ocean.

5690
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:39,980
Fuck that.

5691
02:30:40,300 --> 02:30:41,133
Yeah.

5692
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:45,320
You know how I found out about that and
when we did fear factor there back in

5693
02:30:45,321 --> 02:30:47,050
the design and um,

5694
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:52,960
I got a hold of some sort of pot Brownie
or a cookie or something like that.

5695
02:30:54,771 --> 02:30:55,400
It was,

5696
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:56,450
it was whatever it was.

5697
02:30:56,451 --> 02:30:58,910
It was an edible and it was extra strong.

5698
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:03,230
And I didn't realize how strong
it was until mid ride on the Bart.

5699
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:04,573
I was,

5700
02:31:04,580 --> 02:31:06,110
my ears were popping and I was like,

5701
02:31:06,111 --> 02:31:07,250
why am I ears popping?

5702
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:08,473
And uh,

5703
02:31:08,480 --> 02:31:09,530
my friend Matt said,

5704
02:31:09,531 --> 02:31:12,110
because we're under underwater and I go,

5705
02:31:12,111 --> 02:31:12,944
what?

5706
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:14,630
Like I didn't realize what we were doing.

5707
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:18,440
We were in Oakland and we had to take
a subway to the city to have to have

5708
02:31:18,441 --> 02:31:18,830
dinner,

5709
02:31:18,830 --> 02:31:19,470
this,

5710
02:31:19,470 --> 02:31:20,010
whatever the fuck you

5711
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:20,790
want to call it.

5712
02:31:20,790 --> 02:31:23,970
I literally had no idea this
thing went under the ocean.

5713
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:26,970
So for five minutes or
however long it takes to,

5714
02:31:26,990 --> 02:31:30,270
to make that trip from
Oakland to San Francisco,

5715
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:32,040
I was shitting my pants.

5716
02:31:32,250 --> 02:31:33,750
I mean sweating,

5717
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:35,940
wiping my hands on my pants,

5718
02:31:36,130 --> 02:31:38,000
holding onto that bar and like the,

5719
02:31:38,001 --> 02:31:41,160
the steel bar in the middle of the
fucking thing and wiping my hands in my

5720
02:31:41,161 --> 02:31:41,611
pants,

5721
02:31:41,611 --> 02:31:43,080
just shitting my pants going,

5722
02:31:43,350 --> 02:31:44,180
we're underwater.

5723
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:44,761
All right now.

5724
02:31:44,761 --> 02:31:46,830
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

5725
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:48,990
That's how I felt when we
went to Japan at one point.

5726
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:50,850
Cause I overthought it and I'm like,

5727
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:52,650
we're all very ocean right now.

5728
02:31:52,651 --> 02:31:54,390
Like there's a lot of ocean.

5729
02:31:54,391 --> 02:31:57,660
Like we can go down and there's
no emergency landing right now.

5730
02:31:58,530 --> 02:32:02,760
You're better off on ocean then you
are making an emergency landing on the

5731
02:32:02,761 --> 02:32:07,761
ground where I saw this fucking thing
about colossal squid's a documentary

5732
02:32:07,981 --> 02:32:08,131
about,

5733
02:32:08,131 --> 02:32:10,950
have you ever seen colossal
colossal squid before?

5734
02:32:11,070 --> 02:32:12,240
Giant squids are called?

5735
02:32:12,250 --> 02:32:12,520
Yeah.

5736
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:12,700
Yeah.

5737
02:32:12,700 --> 02:32:14,220
The cold colossals are giant.

5738
02:32:14,230 --> 02:32:16,320
The colossal is the biggest
one they've ever bigger than,

5739
02:32:16,321 --> 02:32:17,390
than giant squids does enough.

5740
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:18,390
Yeah,

5741
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:20,730
I think it's a diff
bigger than a giant squid.

5742
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:21,560
And I,

5743
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:22,590
I think like the biggest one,

5744
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:25,050
I think it was it seven feet tall,

5745
02:32:25,470 --> 02:32:30,470
but they're like dissecting this colossal
squid in like the eyeball alone is the

5746
02:32:30,991 --> 02:32:31,530
size.

5747
02:32:31,530 --> 02:32:33,830
I think they said have a
bowling ball or something.

5748
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:35,160
Oh my God.

5749
02:32:35,690 --> 02:32:37,560
There's a photograph of one that caught,

5750
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:38,050
yeah,

5751
02:32:38,050 --> 02:32:40,200
the class was a squid exhibit.

5752
02:32:40,290 --> 02:32:42,670
Is the exhibit of them catching this way,

5753
02:32:42,671 --> 02:32:43,504
but check this like,

5754
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:44,191
like right here,

5755
02:32:44,191 --> 02:32:45,570
this eyeball like,

5756
02:32:46,150 --> 02:32:46,983
uh,

5757
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:47,801
dude,

5758
02:32:47,801 --> 02:32:51,710
they can be 12 to 14 meters long.

5759
02:32:52,220 --> 02:32:54,560
That's 46 feet long.

5760
02:32:55,730 --> 02:32:56,563
Cool.

5761
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:59,320
That's fucking crazy.

5762
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:02,140
Stop and think about how long 46 feet is.

5763
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:06,820
I guess that though includes the tip of
their stupid little stringy things they

5764
02:33:06,821 --> 02:33:07,960
have hanging in a VM that doesn't,

5765
02:33:08,110 --> 02:33:09,790
that shouldn't count for body mass.

5766
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:11,080
That's like their hair.

5767
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:11,891
Oh my God.

5768
02:33:11,891 --> 02:33:12,724
Look at that time.

5769
02:33:12,880 --> 02:33:13,713
Is that real?

5770
02:33:14,260 --> 02:33:15,610
What the fuck dude?

5771
02:33:16,930 --> 02:33:17,710
Is that a cutter?

5772
02:33:17,710 --> 02:33:18,461
Is that where the,

5773
02:33:18,461 --> 02:33:18,551
uh,

5774
02:33:18,551 --> 02:33:19,384
the topic,

5775
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:21,310
that's not a cut.

5776
02:33:21,640 --> 02:33:22,780
That's where the top is.

5777
02:33:22,781 --> 02:33:23,614
Yeah.

5778
02:33:23,740 --> 02:33:24,281
Oh my God.

5779
02:33:24,281 --> 02:33:25,180
That's its eyeball.

5780
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:26,313
Is that real?

5781
02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:27,941
Do you know?

5782
02:33:27,941 --> 02:33:31,750
It's eyeball developed
independently of the human eyeball.

5783
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:33,220
It's eyeball.

5784
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:37,630
DEPA developed independently of the human
eyeball and strikingly works with the

5785
02:33:37,631 --> 02:33:41,560
same principles because
they deviated from our,

5786
02:33:41,561 --> 02:33:42,070
you know,

5787
02:33:42,070 --> 02:33:42,401
whatever.

5788
02:33:42,401 --> 02:33:44,110
Wherever life came from,

5789
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:44,381
you know,

5790
02:33:44,381 --> 02:33:47,770
whatever primitive life that came from
the ocean that really resulted in all

5791
02:33:47,771 --> 02:33:49,390
mammal life on the planet.

5792
02:33:49,690 --> 02:33:52,150
It all started out as ocean
life at one point in time.

5793
02:33:52,151 --> 02:33:54,130
That was the first life before
there was life anywhere else.

5794
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:58,020
And they were like related to mollusks.

5795
02:33:58,150 --> 02:33:59,770
They'll related to like slugs

5796
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:00,970
and what's really like here,

5797
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:03,750
the difference between of cost is getting
a giant squid is that clause to squids

5798
02:34:03,751 --> 02:34:08,751
have these like these pretty much calls
and these claws are on this circular

5799
02:34:08,911 --> 02:34:09,450
thing.

5800
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:11,490
And when you see them like play with it,

5801
02:34:11,491 --> 02:34:14,550
they're like this and they just turn them
around like a record and they're like,

5802
02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:17,970
these things can rotate
360 and it's just like,

5803
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:20,320
like they're on like
these rotating things.

5804
02:34:20,321 --> 02:34:21,154
Like if they could just spin,

5805
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:22,780
really pull that picture up again.

5806
02:34:22,781 --> 02:34:24,820
So there's suction cups have closets,

5807
02:34:24,950 --> 02:34:26,940
there's Suction Cup has
clubs and this part,

5808
02:34:26,990 --> 02:34:27,490
yeah.

5809
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:28,570
And this part right here,

5810
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:32,680
it turns and three 60 degrees so
it can turn in three 60 degrees.

5811
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:35,290
It's the craziest documentary.

5812
02:34:35,291 --> 02:34:36,310
It's on Netflix right now.

5813
02:34:36,311 --> 02:34:38,290
It's called the colossal squid,

5814
02:34:38,291 --> 02:34:39,124
I believe.

5815
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:39,731
And,

5816
02:34:39,731 --> 02:34:40,060
uh,

5817
02:34:40,060 --> 02:34:41,540
it's a terrifying animals.

5818
02:34:41,550 --> 02:34:42,580
It's so scary.

5819
02:34:43,510 --> 02:34:47,140
What's so funny is that I was
really tired laying on the couch.

5820
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:47,440
I'm like,

5821
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:47,740
alright,

5822
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:50,380
I need a movie to put me to sleep
because I have to wake up early.

5823
02:34:50,530 --> 02:34:53,640
I'm just going to put on some
nature movie about fish or squid.

5824
02:34:53,790 --> 02:34:54,960
It's this,

5825
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:55,960
look at these things.

5826
02:34:55,990 --> 02:34:56,680
I know.

5827
02:34:56,680 --> 02:34:57,041
Pull up.

5828
02:34:57,041 --> 02:34:58,000
Pull that picture up.

5829
02:34:58,450 --> 02:34:59,710
That one's insane.

5830
02:35:00,850 --> 02:35:02,050
Oh my God.

5831
02:35:02,380 --> 02:35:03,550
They're like shark teeth.

5832
02:35:03,610 --> 02:35:04,050
Yeah.

5833
02:35:04,050 --> 02:35:04,930
They'll let you know what it's like.

5834
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:08,590
It's like a giant cat claw
that's coming out of those two,

5835
02:35:08,591 --> 02:35:09,190
right.

5836
02:35:09,190 --> 02:35:10,040
A giant one though.

5837
02:35:10,660 --> 02:35:10,961
Well,

5838
02:35:10,961 --> 02:35:12,280
I told you that the,

5839
02:35:12,281 --> 02:35:12,461
uh,

5840
02:35:12,461 --> 02:35:13,990
the legend of the Crackin,

5841
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:15,670
that's one of the things that they've,

5842
02:35:15,671 --> 02:35:16,450
um,

5843
02:35:16,450 --> 02:35:17,440
they've discovered.

5844
02:35:17,470 --> 02:35:22,330
Look at that fucking thing and
that spins three 60 degrees to,

5845
02:35:22,750 --> 02:35:23,920
oh my God.

5846
02:35:23,921 --> 02:35:25,150
It's like I'm this weird plate.

5847
02:35:25,151 --> 02:35:26,080
It's so weird.

5848
02:35:26,350 --> 02:35:28,510
That is so strange.

5849
02:35:29,320 --> 02:35:31,960
So it just hooks in no
matter where it goes.

5850
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:32,590
Yeah.

5851
02:35:32,590 --> 02:35:35,200
They showed like animals that
have been attacked by it,

5852
02:35:35,201 --> 02:35:36,700
like sharks and stuff like that.

5853
02:35:36,970 --> 02:35:40,390
And the sharks just all torn up from
it because it just latches in and just

5854
02:35:40,391 --> 02:35:41,224
rips.

5855
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:43,090
That's fucking insane.

5856
02:35:43,130 --> 02:35:43,870
Yeah,

5857
02:35:43,870 --> 02:35:45,590
the ocean is so scary.

5858
02:35:45,591 --> 02:35:45,671
Yeah.

5859
02:35:45,671 --> 02:35:48,130
So I put it in this video
to like go to bed too.

5860
02:35:48,131 --> 02:35:48,910
Cause I thought like,

5861
02:35:48,910 --> 02:35:50,320
you know like oh a squid.

5862
02:35:50,321 --> 02:35:51,160
It's quiet.

5863
02:35:51,161 --> 02:35:52,150
It's not gonna make any noise.

5864
02:35:52,151 --> 02:35:53,590
It's going to be quiet documentary.

5865
02:35:54,010 --> 02:35:57,280
And then the whole time I'm just hearing
all this shit like we are now taking

5866
02:35:57,281 --> 02:35:58,360
the eyeball out and I'm like,

5867
02:35:58,390 --> 02:35:58,640
oh,

5868
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:00,760
this is the most fucked
up video I've ever seen.

5869
02:36:00,970 --> 02:36:01,601
One of the fucked up,

5870
02:36:01,601 --> 02:36:02,470
most fucked up videos.

5871
02:36:02,770 --> 02:36:03,603
Nature videos.

5872
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:04,511
Yeah,

5873
02:36:04,511 --> 02:36:04,900
that,

5874
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:05,960
that's a new thing.

5875
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:09,960
They were like octopus ones
that were just suction cups.

5876
02:36:10,140 --> 02:36:10,891
I didn't know that.

5877
02:36:10,891 --> 02:36:11,101
They're,

5878
02:36:11,101 --> 02:36:12,450
they're really like claws.

5879
02:36:12,790 --> 02:36:13,000
No,

5880
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:13,980
only if you chop one off.

5881
02:36:13,981 --> 02:36:14,850
Don't think grow right back.

5882
02:36:15,150 --> 02:36:15,983
I don't know.

5883
02:36:16,570 --> 02:36:19,350
I know that's the case with
the alligators with alligators.

5884
02:36:19,351 --> 02:36:21,420
He chopped their leg off and
throw them back in the water.

5885
02:36:21,660 --> 02:36:24,840
They just fucking heal up
and start growing a new foot.

5886
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:26,190
Creepy cons.

5887
02:36:27,730 --> 02:36:28,680
That's kind of cool though.

5888
02:36:28,980 --> 02:36:30,390
It'd be nice if that happened with people.

5889
02:36:30,690 --> 02:36:31,230
Yeah.

5890
02:36:31,230 --> 02:36:31,921
Chop your hand off.

5891
02:36:31,921 --> 02:36:32,910
You just grow your hand back.

5892
02:36:32,930 --> 02:36:34,980
Shop her day off and wait
for a big winner grow back.

5893
02:36:36,390 --> 02:36:37,223
That's how it works.

5894
02:36:37,370 --> 02:36:38,730
If every time you chop your dick off,

5895
02:36:38,731 --> 02:36:41,430
it just grew back bigger or are you just,

5896
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:41,810
yeah,

5897
02:36:41,810 --> 02:36:42,290
it was like uh,

5898
02:36:42,290 --> 02:36:43,650
a chance that would,

5899
02:36:44,070 --> 02:36:44,401
and you,

5900
02:36:44,401 --> 02:36:47,940
you got got all the way to like 10
inches and you're like not satisfied.

5901
02:36:47,960 --> 02:36:48,970
That's taking the tramadol.

5902
02:36:49,110 --> 02:36:53,040
It's like a six month wait and then the
next time it grows shorter and you're

5903
02:36:53,041 --> 02:36:53,160
like,

5904
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:53,611
oh my God,

5905
02:36:53,611 --> 02:36:54,361
I fucked up.

5906
02:36:54,361 --> 02:36:56,500
I should have stuck with the 10 gaps.

5907
02:36:56,530 --> 02:37:01,500
Or while he cut it off so much you develop
scar tissue or on your nut sack you.

5908
02:37:01,501 --> 02:37:03,660
Dick Dick just doesn't
grow to full length.

5909
02:37:05,790 --> 02:37:07,140
If there was a time,

5910
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:10,950
if there comes a time where we really
can engineer the size of various body

5911
02:37:10,951 --> 02:37:11,580
parts,

5912
02:37:11,580 --> 02:37:13,170
people are going to look so strange.

5913
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:15,630
I guarantee you it's going happen.

5914
02:37:15,690 --> 02:37:16,110
I mean it's just

5915
02:37:16,110 --> 02:37:21,110
a matter of time before someone has
giant like those foam number one hands.

5916
02:37:22,530 --> 02:37:24,270
That's what their hands are actually life.

5917
02:37:24,510 --> 02:37:25,343
You know,

5918
02:37:25,890 --> 02:37:29,790
genetically modified people sort of like
how we have tomatoes that you can sit

5919
02:37:29,791 --> 02:37:32,820
on a truck in the hot sun for
a day and they don't go bad.

5920
02:37:33,180 --> 02:37:33,391
You know,

5921
02:37:33,391 --> 02:37:34,800
you get to transport them for weeks.

5922
02:37:34,801 --> 02:37:35,550
They don't go bad.

5923
02:37:35,550 --> 02:37:36,480
It's like the duck lips.

5924
02:37:36,990 --> 02:37:37,381
No,

5925
02:37:37,381 --> 02:37:37,561
no,

5926
02:37:37,561 --> 02:37:37,741
no,

5927
02:37:37,741 --> 02:37:37,951
no,

5928
02:37:37,951 --> 02:37:38,071
no.

5929
02:37:38,071 --> 02:37:42,390
Because that's fake cause shooting shit
into their lips and it looks stupid.

5930
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:43,311
This is your,

5931
02:37:43,311 --> 02:37:48,311
you're going to be able to engineered
big giant plump Angelina Jolie Lips.

5932
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:50,430
You're going to be able to just get those,

5933
02:37:52,110 --> 02:37:55,800
there's gonna come a point in time
where there will be no ugly people.

5934
02:37:56,520 --> 02:38:00,510
There'll be no unattractive people
because we will engineer what people look

5935
02:38:00,511 --> 02:38:01,344
like.

5936
02:38:01,650 --> 02:38:04,470
And it probably at first it'll just
be rich people with then it's gonna

5937
02:38:04,471 --> 02:38:06,230
eventually get to a point where it's,

5938
02:38:06,270 --> 02:38:07,680
it's not going to matter.

5939
02:38:07,860 --> 02:38:10,530
It's going to be cheap enough like a
cell phone where the majority of people

5940
02:38:10,531 --> 02:38:11,364
have it.

5941
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:14,280
But then I think we're
probably be going to,

5942
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:19,500
I think evolutionarily we're probably
going to like start wanting to fuck ugly.

5943
02:38:19,501 --> 02:38:21,060
People are like,

5944
02:38:21,061 --> 02:38:21,894
you know what,

5945
02:38:22,180 --> 02:38:23,490
I need a robust girl.

5946
02:38:23,491 --> 02:38:24,690
The fucking thick waste.

5947
02:38:24,691 --> 02:38:26,550
And a face that could take a punch.

5948
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:26,971
You know,

5949
02:38:26,971 --> 02:38:27,121
we're,

5950
02:38:27,121 --> 02:38:31,470
we're gonna like we're gonna not
like this artificial attractive,

5951
02:38:31,471 --> 02:38:32,880
perfect symmetry.

5952
02:38:32,881 --> 02:38:33,390
I bet.

5953
02:38:33,390 --> 02:38:34,100
I bet our,

5954
02:38:34,100 --> 02:38:36,990
our genetics will come
to recognize that that's,

5955
02:38:37,230 --> 02:38:40,830
that this artificial symmetry is
probably not good for the genome,

5956
02:38:40,831 --> 02:38:41,670
for competition.

5957
02:38:41,820 --> 02:38:46,560
That it's like it's been hijacked so it
will like veer towards like ugly people

5958
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:47,970
or thick people.

5959
02:38:48,270 --> 02:38:49,010
Are you like

5960
02:38:49,010 --> 02:38:50,010
friend Tony's sister?

5961
02:38:50,011 --> 02:38:51,620
Hey,

5962
02:38:51,690 --> 02:38:52,523
exactly.

5963
02:38:53,490 --> 02:38:54,150
Go Shark.

5964
02:38:54,150 --> 02:38:54,983
Have you seen go shark?

5965
02:38:55,050 --> 02:38:55,883
What's that?

5966
02:38:56,560 --> 02:38:57,110
Go Scott.

5967
02:38:57,110 --> 02:38:58,070
It's a Goblin Shark.

5968
02:38:58,310 --> 02:38:59,060
What is it?

5969
02:38:59,060 --> 02:38:59,421
I don't know.

5970
02:38:59,421 --> 02:39:00,240
It's pretty cool.

5971
02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:01,220
Check to a movie.

5972
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:04,220
This is this real,

5973
02:39:04,221 --> 02:39:04,880
yeah,

5974
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:05,510
come on.

5975
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:05,661
Oh,

5976
02:39:05,661 --> 02:39:06,920
a Goblin shark.

5977
02:39:06,950 --> 02:39:07,760
Yeah.

5978
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:09,560
Oh yes.

5979
02:39:09,740 --> 02:39:11,380
It's got like a mouth inside of it now.

5980
02:39:11,450 --> 02:39:12,980
It's a creepy fucking cunt.

5981
02:39:12,981 --> 02:39:13,814
What it is,

5982
02:39:14,180 --> 02:39:15,650
it looks like a skeleton.

5983
02:39:16,330 --> 02:39:17,163
Sharp shape.

5984
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:18,260
Jesus Christ

5985
02:39:20,530 --> 02:39:23,450
to the ocean is so gross.

5986
02:39:24,200 --> 02:39:24,441
I mean,

5987
02:39:24,441 --> 02:39:25,550
it's so fascinating really,

5988
02:39:25,551 --> 02:39:27,770
because you might as
well be in outer space

5989
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:28,330
base,

5990
02:39:28,330 --> 02:39:29,163
right?

5991
02:39:29,590 --> 02:39:31,750
It's actually probably
crazier than outer space.

5992
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:33,460
Oh Jesus Christ.

5993
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:35,260
Because that's scary.

5994
02:39:35,830 --> 02:39:37,600
What a fucking monster.

5995
02:39:37,630 --> 02:39:41,980
It's kind of like there's a monster inside
of a skin of a shark that's using the

5996
02:39:41,981 --> 02:39:42,814
skin.

5997
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:45,460
Just like hide it looks like,

5998
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:47,840
like a moray eel coming out of his mouth.

5999
02:39:48,050 --> 02:39:49,100
I wonder if that was the answer

6000
02:39:49,170 --> 02:39:50,400
operation for alien.

6001
02:39:50,460 --> 02:39:50,920
Yeah.

6002
02:39:50,920 --> 02:39:51,331
Looks like it.

6003
02:39:51,331 --> 02:39:51,900
Right.

6004
02:39:51,900 --> 02:39:52,201
Wow.

6005
02:39:52,201 --> 02:39:53,034
Look at that thing.

6006
02:39:53,250 --> 02:39:54,083
What's it biting?

6007
02:39:54,610 --> 02:39:56,610
I think it's just like the camera careers,

6008
02:39:56,611 --> 02:39:57,361
like equipment.

6009
02:39:57,361 --> 02:39:59,340
Like they're just trying to
get it to bite something.

6010
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:00,720
Most of the sticking it in front of it.

6011
02:40:00,721 --> 02:40:01,554
Yeah.

6012
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:02,910
Frees itself

6013
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:05,930
original shape.

6014
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:07,691
Oh,

6015
02:40:07,691 --> 02:40:08,524
it got stuck.

6016
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:10,720
And the bit that pipe or
whatever the fuck that is.

6017
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:14,110
You know what's really crazy about

6018
02:40:14,110 --> 02:40:16,030
the ocean is they don't
even know what's down there.

6019
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:17,770
They kind of know.

6020
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:20,590
But there's so much room
for discovering new species.

6021
02:40:20,860 --> 02:40:21,071
You know,

6022
02:40:21,071 --> 02:40:21,231
they,

6023
02:40:21,231 --> 02:40:23,770
they discover new species
on the land every day.

6024
02:40:23,771 --> 02:40:24,670
Like there's always like,

6025
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:26,130
and they actually found a,

6026
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:28,360
like really recently
within the last decade,

6027
02:40:28,390 --> 02:40:31,780
like a big animal in Vietnam
that they didn't know existed.

6028
02:40:31,781 --> 02:40:33,820
It was like some kind of an
antelope or something like that.

6029
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:34,810
They just,

6030
02:40:34,810 --> 02:40:37,780
Vietnam was so dense and there was um,

6031
02:40:38,710 --> 02:40:41,380
I think it was like 10 years ago
they discovered this fucking thing.

6032
02:40:41,381 --> 02:40:42,610
I might've even less than that,

6033
02:40:43,690 --> 02:40:44,750
but we've,

6034
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:45,281
you know,

6035
02:40:45,281 --> 02:40:48,820
there's people that have been
almost every section of the world,

6036
02:40:48,821 --> 02:40:49,840
or at least once,

6037
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:50,210
you know,

6038
02:40:50,210 --> 02:40:51,850
been near these parts of the world.

6039
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:55,410
And although there's
some crypto zoologist,

6040
02:40:55,430 --> 02:40:57,130
I believe there's a bunch
of species to be found.

6041
02:40:57,131 --> 02:40:58,780
It's probably a fairly limited number.

6042
02:40:59,350 --> 02:41:00,760
Put the ocean man,

6043
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:02,260
we fully discovered,

6044
02:41:02,530 --> 02:41:04,150
I think they said that they've,

6045
02:41:04,180 --> 02:41:04,780
um,

6046
02:41:04,780 --> 02:41:07,270
they've explored 10% of the ocean.

6047
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:09,700
Like so 90% of the ocean,

6048
02:41:09,701 --> 02:41:11,320
they don't know what the
fuck's going on down there.

6049
02:41:11,590 --> 02:41:12,423
They have like,

6050
02:41:13,150 --> 02:41:17,680
they have maps of the depth and they know
like how far down it goes and what the

6051
02:41:17,681 --> 02:41:19,660
contour of the earth
looks like down there.

6052
02:41:19,661 --> 02:41:22,810
And they know like the
topography of the bottom.

6053
02:41:23,350 --> 02:41:24,820
But I don't think they
know all this stuff.

6054
02:41:24,860 --> 02:41:26,030
Vcs Now they,

6055
02:41:26,031 --> 02:41:27,520
they find new species every year.

6056
02:41:27,521 --> 02:41:29,050
They find tons of underwater,

6057
02:41:29,110 --> 02:41:30,700
mostly underwater species.

6058
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:31,001
You know,

6059
02:41:31,001 --> 02:41:32,830
there's of course a lot of insects like,

6060
02:41:33,340 --> 02:41:34,060
like uh,

6061
02:41:34,060 --> 02:41:38,290
there's like there's a Darwin's bark
spider that they just found two years ago,

6062
02:41:38,291 --> 02:41:39,130
which is crazy.

6063
02:41:39,131 --> 02:41:39,760
It looks like a look.

6064
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:40,593
See here's a,

6065
02:41:40,610 --> 02:41:41,590
that's like a cyclops.

6066
02:41:41,650 --> 02:41:43,300
I'd spider on the list.

6067
02:41:43,390 --> 02:41:44,890
Is there a place that gives you,

6068
02:41:44,891 --> 02:41:47,110
like is there a website
that had like a new species?

6069
02:41:47,111 --> 02:41:48,670
You can track them down be kind of cool.

6070
02:41:48,760 --> 02:41:49,001
No,

6071
02:41:49,001 --> 02:41:49,451
but if you just,

6072
02:41:49,451 --> 02:41:53,940
usually if you to put in
like top 10 species of 2012
or [inaudible] there is its

6073
02:41:53,941 --> 02:41:54,774
species.

6074
02:41:55,030 --> 02:41:55,840
Asu.

6075
02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:56,171
Yeah.

6076
02:41:56,171 --> 02:41:59,740
National Institute for
species exploration.

6077
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:04,330
It's a Arizona state and
they have all the top 10

6078
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:08,640
new species of 2012 wow.

6079
02:42:08,730 --> 02:42:09,520
Interesting.

6080
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:10,111
I remember that.

6081
02:42:10,111 --> 02:42:10,741
A squid,

6082
02:42:10,741 --> 02:42:14,670
we played that before that squid that
they found near one of those oil rigs.

6083
02:42:14,700 --> 02:42:17,160
Never seen before with crab legs.

6084
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:19,530
Creepy fucking monsters.

6085
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:22,590
Gigantic squid with crab legs,

6086
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:26,550
crab legs and big
country Shark Tooth Dick.

6087
02:42:26,551 --> 02:42:30,030
Like things that it just wraps
around stuff and rips it apart.

6088
02:42:32,770 --> 02:42:33,700
No is,

6089
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:34,230
yeah,

6090
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:34,951
fuck that noise.

6091
02:42:34,951 --> 02:42:35,784
Indeed man.

6092
02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:37,110
It's fascinating though.

6093
02:42:38,410 --> 02:42:38,580
It,

6094
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:38,941
then we're,

6095
02:42:38,941 --> 02:42:39,271
you know,

6096
02:42:39,271 --> 02:42:40,051
if we found that,

6097
02:42:40,051 --> 02:42:40,831
what's really interesting,

6098
02:42:40,831 --> 02:42:42,870
if we found that thing
walking around on Mars,

6099
02:42:42,871 --> 02:42:44,190
people would be shitting their pants.

6100
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:47,520
Like I'll just fucking thing it's
got this clause and it's why,

6101
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:51,960
I mean it would be the subject of every
science fiction movie that people went

6102
02:42:51,961 --> 02:42:52,620
there and it,

6103
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:52,980
it uh,

6104
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:57,330
they brought back a probe and apparently
it had seeds of this squid thing,

6105
02:42:58,240 --> 02:42:59,440
like a venom head crab.

6106
02:42:59,470 --> 02:43:00,303
You were saying one of those.

6107
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:01,020
What is that?

6108
02:43:01,020 --> 02:43:01,853
It's like a,

6109
02:43:01,880 --> 02:43:05,330
what the fuck is that dude?

6110
02:43:05,331 --> 02:43:06,410
That's like a fist.

6111
02:43:06,770 --> 02:43:07,603
I know.

6112
02:43:07,880 --> 02:43:09,440
That is so creepy.

6113
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:11,350
And that's on land.

6114
02:43:12,460 --> 02:43:13,360
Is that a spider?

6115
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:14,950
Take a head crab dude.

6116
02:43:14,951 --> 02:43:16,450
That looks like something from,

6117
02:43:16,780 --> 02:43:17,860
from halflife.

6118
02:43:18,700 --> 02:43:19,590
Is that half life?

6119
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:20,860
You fucking

6120
02:43:23,270 --> 02:43:24,370
Dick was actually,

6121
02:43:24,371 --> 02:43:25,204
I thought it was

6122
02:43:26,650 --> 02:43:28,590
at first I thought it was
a real but didn't actually,

6123
02:43:29,490 --> 02:43:30,323
it's anyways.

6124
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:33,850
Yeah,

6125
02:43:33,850 --> 02:43:38,230
if you found a squid on the moon you'd
be shitting your pants or you would say

6126
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:39,610
it's going to Italy and
make a movie about it.

6127
02:43:40,290 --> 02:43:42,700
I mean like just an elephant on the moon.

6128
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:43,391
People be like,

6129
02:43:43,391 --> 02:43:44,770
what the fuck?

6130
02:43:45,010 --> 02:43:46,420
Like elephants didn't exist.

6131
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:48,280
And they found elephant on the moon.

6132
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:50,380
Who'd would be like the
most studied thing ever?

6133
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:51,790
We would be going crazy.

6134
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:55,000
But you know it's on
the ground where like,

6135
02:43:55,001 --> 02:43:55,390
yeah,

6136
02:43:55,390 --> 02:43:56,223
I seen that.

6137
02:43:57,760 --> 02:43:58,750
Not that interesting.

6138
02:43:59,790 --> 02:44:01,420
Went to the Santa Barbara
Zoo the other day.

6139
02:44:02,010 --> 02:44:02,790
Lucky.

6140
02:44:02,790 --> 02:44:02,980
Aw,

6141
02:44:02,980 --> 02:44:03,520
sad part.

6142
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:04,600
Which I still haven't
been to that is there.

6143
02:44:04,601 --> 02:44:04,810
Yeah,

6144
02:44:04,810 --> 02:44:05,021
dude,

6145
02:44:05,021 --> 02:44:06,500
you got to go to Santa Barbara some day.

6146
02:44:06,501 --> 02:44:08,590
Let's have a like a field trip day.

6147
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:10,660
Beautiful show at night there.

6148
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:11,470
Yeah.

6149
02:44:11,470 --> 02:44:12,820
It's so nice down there.

6150
02:44:12,850 --> 02:44:13,683
First of all,

6151
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:15,430
Santa Barbara is like the perfect weather.

6152
02:44:15,850 --> 02:44:19,050
People are less stressed out because
there's no traffic and they're like,

6153
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:21,400
it's a noticeably more chill town.

6154
02:44:22,190 --> 02:44:25,480
A lot of people go to move there when
they give up on the Hollywood dream.

6155
02:44:25,990 --> 02:44:26,890
I think if,

6156
02:44:26,970 --> 02:44:28,240
even if it is he here,

6157
02:44:29,590 --> 02:44:29,921
but uh,

6158
02:44:29,921 --> 02:44:30,754
they have a zoo,

6159
02:44:31,450 --> 02:44:32,101
small zoo,

6160
02:44:32,101 --> 02:44:33,310
I can get around it pretty quick,

6161
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:36,000
but they have fucking gorillas and a,

6162
02:44:36,050 --> 02:44:36,731
they have a,

6163
02:44:36,731 --> 02:44:37,360
um,

6164
02:44:37,360 --> 02:44:38,830
they call them a bachelor,

6165
02:44:38,831 --> 02:44:41,530
the like bachelor groups
that they hang out in.

6166
02:44:41,950 --> 02:44:42,431
And a,

6167
02:44:42,431 --> 02:44:44,560
they had this one gorilla and
it was his birthday there.

6168
02:44:44,561 --> 02:44:46,240
So they'd given him a cake
or something like that.

6169
02:44:46,630 --> 02:44:48,940
And you get up right
close to that thing in.

6170
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:53,960
Do you like what a ridiculous creation
by nature this re don't callously

6171
02:44:54,701 --> 02:44:58,300
muscular giant little human thing.

6172
02:44:58,630 --> 02:44:59,890
Five foot four,

6173
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:04,030
200 and fucking 98 which
products leave like 400 pounds?

6174
02:45:04,031 --> 02:45:06,310
I think it was 398 pounds.

6175
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:11,790
Just the gigantically muscular thing
that eats broccoli just has giant fangs

6176
02:45:12,821 --> 02:45:13,990
just to keep you the fuck away.

6177
02:45:13,991 --> 02:45:15,010
Why he eats Broccoli.

6178
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:16,870
The end to fight for pussy.

6179
02:45:17,470 --> 02:45:19,790
That's why it has giant fans and that's,

6180
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:20,740
that's what it's for.

6181
02:45:21,030 --> 02:45:22,300
They don't kill anything.

6182
02:45:22,301 --> 02:45:24,050
You look at the mouth of a gorilla,

6183
02:45:24,490 --> 02:45:25,960
gorillas like fangs,

6184
02:45:25,961 --> 02:45:26,400
like,

6185
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:26,950
like,

6186
02:45:26,950 --> 02:45:29,370
let me Google gorilla phase real.

6187
02:45:29,371 --> 02:45:30,204
Uh,

6188
02:45:30,910 --> 02:45:33,190
you would swear that thing eats people.

6189
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:34,150
Yeah.

6190
02:45:34,150 --> 02:45:35,710
Oh my God.

6191
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:37,300
Look at that fucking picture.

6192
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:38,913
Yeah.

6193
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:44,140
You imagine that's an 800 pound primate,

6194
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:47,560
those giant silver backs.

6195
02:45:47,590 --> 02:45:48,760
Especially the ones in the wild.

6196
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:52,510
I like those zoo bitches
eating birthday cake.

6197
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:55,180
She ain't got nicked birthday.

6198
02:45:56,410 --> 02:45:57,340
Birthday in the Congo.

6199
02:45:57,341 --> 02:46:01,870
You fuckhead birthday know this is
one of my favorite pictures ever.

6200
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:06,970
These two gorillas leaping at each other
in the middle of a firefight walls.

6201
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:13,550
They didn't even know the gorillas
existed until like the early 19 hundreds

6202
02:46:14,110 --> 02:46:14,740
after Degas.

6203
02:46:14,740 --> 02:46:15,230
Yeah.

6204
02:46:15,230 --> 02:46:15,900
That's,

6205
02:46:15,900 --> 02:46:18,290
we think of gorilla is something
that we always known about.

6206
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:19,131
But let me see.

6207
02:46:19,131 --> 02:46:20,330
Discover the mountain gorilla.

6208
02:46:20,430 --> 02:46:20,860
Yeah,

6209
02:46:20,860 --> 02:46:22,430
but they think it used
to be just like vikings.

6210
02:46:22,431 --> 02:46:22,760
There's one.

6211
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:23,593
It was just a,

6212
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:27,530
I think it was just a,

6213
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:29,180
it was a rumor.

6214
02:46:29,450 --> 02:46:31,040
I don't think it was a real animal.

6215
02:46:31,250 --> 02:46:34,340
I think people hadn't
been to the area where it,

6216
02:46:34,341 --> 02:46:34,760
uh,

6217
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:36,800
it exists and so they,

6218
02:46:36,801 --> 02:46:37,460
um,

6219
02:46:37,460 --> 02:46:37,940
they just,

6220
02:46:37,940 --> 02:46:38,840
they didn't know man.

6221
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:39,891
Yeah.

6222
02:46:39,891 --> 02:46:40,161
Okay.

6223
02:46:40,161 --> 02:46:41,300
1902 man.

6224
02:46:41,560 --> 02:46:41,860
Yeah,

6225
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:45,810
it's a great discovery of the mountain
grill was 1902 now we think about that

6226
02:46:45,811 --> 02:46:46,071
with like,

6227
02:46:46,071 --> 02:46:49,700
that doesn't even make sense to us
that that's a hundred years ago.

6228
02:46:50,110 --> 02:46:51,470
111 years ago.

6229
02:46:51,940 --> 02:46:56,620
Is that just because maybe we didn't
have really good telephones at the time

6230
02:46:56,621 --> 02:46:59,680
that some people would like in
countries that had gorillas were like,

6231
02:46:59,681 --> 02:46:59,861
dude,

6232
02:46:59,861 --> 02:47:01,800
we're getting eaten alive
by these big gorilla mom.

6233
02:47:02,390 --> 02:47:02,991
Listen to this.

6234
02:47:02,991 --> 02:47:04,580
Nearly 2,500 years ago.

6235
02:47:04,581 --> 02:47:05,690
An expedition from the,

6236
02:47:06,130 --> 02:47:06,963
for Noah,

6237
02:47:07,480 --> 02:47:08,720
full neat Phoenician,

6238
02:47:08,750 --> 02:47:09,770
Phoenician merchant,

6239
02:47:09,771 --> 02:47:13,280
city of Cathartic to
western coast of Africa,

6240
02:47:13,281 --> 02:47:17,540
accidentally discovered a group of wild
gorillas upon first encountering the

6241
02:47:17,541 --> 02:47:18,320
gorillas.

6242
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:21,350
African local shared their name
for the giant ape with them.

6243
02:47:21,470 --> 02:47:24,740
The rough translation of
which meant hairy person.

6244
02:47:25,700 --> 02:47:28,430
So this is 2000 it's 500 years ago.

6245
02:47:28,550 --> 02:47:30,560
These people wrote stories.

6246
02:47:31,670 --> 02:47:33,560
These are real assholes.

6247
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:38,810
An expedition from Carthage road stories.

6248
02:47:38,811 --> 02:47:43,160
Some ancient explorers have described
gorillas as primitive Harry people.

6249
02:47:43,250 --> 02:47:46,820
They've also been referred to
as anthropoid or man like apes.

6250
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:47,953
Wow.

6251
02:47:49,580 --> 02:47:50,630
This is nuts.

6252
02:47:51,440 --> 02:47:52,520
This guy spoke of,

6253
02:47:52,521 --> 02:47:55,160
I'm another guy in the
16th century spoke of them.

6254
02:47:56,030 --> 02:47:57,580
So it seems like what what,

6255
02:47:57,590 --> 02:48:01,220
what happens is these people
go and they see these things,

6256
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:05,840
but it's so rare that like a westerner
ever went there that no one really had an

6257
02:48:05,841 --> 02:48:10,841
opportunity to study like 1902 it was
probably the first time like civilized

6258
02:48:11,181 --> 02:48:13,670
folk got on a big metal boat,

6259
02:48:13,770 --> 02:48:15,200
made it all the way the fuck down there.

6260
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:16,093
You know?

6261
02:48:16,550 --> 02:48:17,510
Did they even have metal boats?

6262
02:48:17,530 --> 02:48:18,710
1902 they must've right?

6263
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:20,593
Probably right.

6264
02:48:21,290 --> 02:48:22,550
They probably figured that shit out.

6265
02:48:22,700 --> 02:48:24,890
Those big giant metal
boats that they have now.

6266
02:48:24,891 --> 02:48:26,710
Like the titanic there,

6267
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:28,880
that 1902 titanic,

6268
02:48:28,881 --> 02:48:29,714
right?

6269
02:48:30,030 --> 02:48:30,870
Well they're not.

6270
02:48:30,871 --> 02:48:32,600
The titanic was in the twenties no.

6271
02:48:33,230 --> 02:48:34,580
What year did the titanic go down?

6272
02:48:35,210 --> 02:48:36,680
How with and artist.

6273
02:48:38,090 --> 02:48:40,130
What year did the titanic go down?

6274
02:48:41,480 --> 02:48:42,740
Wow,

6275
02:48:43,310 --> 02:48:48,310
1912 do you know how science fiction
that must have been in 1912 to see this

6276
02:48:48,860 --> 02:48:53,210
enormous like building
that floats on the water.

6277
02:48:53,460 --> 02:48:56,610
I wish we had better video of
the in Heidelberg or whatever.

6278
02:48:56,630 --> 02:48:57,750
It's didn't Annenberg.

6279
02:48:57,751 --> 02:48:58,400
Yeah.

6280
02:48:58,400 --> 02:48:59,510
That's not that big a deal though.

6281
02:48:59,511 --> 02:49:00,380
That's just a z.

6282
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:02,500
A Zap one visual of that.

6283
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:03,450
That,

6284
02:49:03,450 --> 02:49:06,590
I mean just the video that they
had of that was so intense.

6285
02:49:06,620 --> 02:49:06,830
Yeah,

6286
02:49:06,830 --> 02:49:07,440
pull that up.

6287
02:49:07,440 --> 02:49:08,273
All right,

6288
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:09,180
so cool.

6289
02:49:09,180 --> 02:49:09,571
Hold that up.

6290
02:49:09,571 --> 02:49:10,560
The Hindenburg disaster.

6291
02:49:10,710 --> 02:49:12,480
Well that's when they realized
they couldn't do that anymore.

6292
02:49:12,540 --> 02:49:15,270
They thought they were going to be able
to like fly people all over the world.

6293
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:17,070
Well this is going to be wonderful.

6294
02:49:17,071 --> 02:49:18,960
These giant gas balls,

6295
02:49:19,290 --> 02:49:20,250
but they didn't realize it.

6296
02:49:20,251 --> 02:49:21,330
When those things go down,

6297
02:49:21,360 --> 02:49:22,470
Holy Shit.

6298
02:49:22,471 --> 02:49:24,000
Do they go down hard?

6299
02:49:24,390 --> 02:49:27,510
They get hit by lightening and just
burst into flame in the middle of the sky

6300
02:49:27,511 --> 02:49:28,440
and everybody dies.

6301
02:49:29,850 --> 02:49:31,320
That was a strange time.

6302
02:49:33,390 --> 02:49:35,460
I told you that I have
a reoccurring dream.

6303
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:37,240
I've had it several times and I,

6304
02:49:37,250 --> 02:49:39,060
I know I talked about it once before.

6305
02:49:39,750 --> 02:49:41,790
I had this weird crawling
and I wrote it down.

6306
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:44,220
I wrote down the story
that happens in my dream,

6307
02:49:44,610 --> 02:49:48,540
but in my dream there was
a thousand Nikola Tesla's,

6308
02:49:48,541 --> 02:49:49,890
it wasn't just one guy,

6309
02:49:50,130 --> 02:49:51,570
it was like a thousand guys.

6310
02:49:51,870 --> 02:49:52,521
And the,

6311
02:49:52,521 --> 02:49:55,020
the thing that I wrote was actually
called like I wrote a piece called the

6312
02:49:55,021 --> 02:50:00,021
thousand Teslas and it was the 1940s is
the 1940s that I keep having this dream

6313
02:50:00,271 --> 02:50:04,320
this night in the 1950s rather like
during the era of those big Cadillacs,

6314
02:50:04,321 --> 02:50:09,321
it was big fucking things and the that
was still going on but they were flying

6315
02:50:10,230 --> 02:50:13,860
and that people were having
like these flying Cadillacs,

6316
02:50:13,861 --> 02:50:14,730
they were like that.

6317
02:50:15,030 --> 02:50:15,451
And there,

6318
02:50:15,451 --> 02:50:17,790
there was doc ports all over the city.

6319
02:50:17,791 --> 02:50:21,630
These platforms where you would pull
in with your giant flying Cadillac.

6320
02:50:21,990 --> 02:50:25,620
And it was a really strange
dream because New York City,

6321
02:50:25,621 --> 02:50:25,891
it was,

6322
02:50:25,891 --> 02:50:28,140
it was probably New York City
or wherever it was that was,

6323
02:50:28,141 --> 02:50:28,974
you know,

6324
02:50:29,070 --> 02:50:29,940
some large cities,

6325
02:50:29,941 --> 02:50:30,750
Chicago maybe.

6326
02:50:30,750 --> 02:50:32,100
But whatever the city was in,

6327
02:50:32,101 --> 02:50:36,900
which it took place was very much like
you would expect a city from the 1950s

6328
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:40,350
but much more advanced technologically.

6329
02:50:40,351 --> 02:50:43,560
Like there was just some new
shit that we don't have yet.

6330
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:47,640
And it was a lot of blimps flying back
and forth in the sky and there was a lot

6331
02:50:47,641 --> 02:50:48,451
of air travel.

6332
02:50:48,451 --> 02:50:53,451
It's like people kind of
completely abandoned traveling
with cars on the ground

6333
02:50:54,360 --> 02:50:55,193
or you know,

6334
02:50:55,210 --> 02:50:56,730
gotten rid of most of it in my dream.

6335
02:50:56,840 --> 02:51:01,320
It's a really weird fucking dream
I've had a couple times to do,

6336
02:51:01,350 --> 02:51:01,610
you know,

6337
02:51:01,610 --> 02:51:03,600
just to take place in la
or is it like he'll say,

6338
02:51:03,630 --> 02:51:04,463
oh no,

6339
02:51:04,590 --> 02:51:04,991
it doesn't.

6340
02:51:04,991 --> 02:51:05,280
It does.

6341
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:07,140
It's all takes place in manmade creation.

6342
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:10,050
So it's impossible to say where it's
taking place in the stupid dream of mine,

6343
02:51:10,090 --> 02:51:12,540
but were like walking out and watch it.

6344
02:51:12,541 --> 02:51:16,200
I'm an observer and the observer
and the dream is always like,

6345
02:51:16,201 --> 02:51:18,330
the concept is that there
was a thousand Teslas.

6346
02:51:18,331 --> 02:51:22,710
It wasn't just one super genius invention
guy that figures out it's just back to

6347
02:51:22,711 --> 02:51:23,131
the future.

6348
02:51:23,131 --> 02:51:23,964
What does this,

6349
02:51:26,310 --> 02:51:26,580
yeah,

6350
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:27,030
it's not,

6351
02:51:27,030 --> 02:51:27,291
it's,

6352
02:51:27,291 --> 02:51:27,930
it's what it,

6353
02:51:27,930 --> 02:51:30,240
what it is like in my dream was like,

6354
02:51:30,270 --> 02:51:31,103
um,

6355
02:51:32,040 --> 02:51:32,873
it was,

6356
02:51:33,130 --> 02:51:34,290
what was that movie?

6357
02:51:34,291 --> 02:51:36,870
The rocketeer what was
that mother rocketeer yeah,

6358
02:51:36,871 --> 02:51:37,681
you remember that movie?

6359
02:51:37,681 --> 02:51:38,790
How like,

6360
02:51:39,780 --> 02:51:40,613
Oh shit,

6361
02:51:40,890 --> 02:51:41,720
she wasn't really high.

6362
02:51:41,720 --> 02:51:43,310
It was don't say that or I brushed her,

6363
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:44,193
don't say that.

6364
02:51:45,060 --> 02:51:45,893
Um,

6365
02:51:46,080 --> 02:51:46,471
they,

6366
02:51:46,471 --> 02:51:46,860
uh,

6367
02:51:46,860 --> 02:51:50,250
they did a good job of that
movie of capturing that era,

6368
02:51:50,640 --> 02:51:51,780
the rocket tiers era,

6369
02:51:52,110 --> 02:51:54,120
but also having this crazy technology,

6370
02:51:54,121 --> 02:51:54,954
which was like,

6371
02:51:54,990 --> 02:51:57,150
if you look at those science
fiction magazines of the day,

6372
02:51:57,151 --> 02:51:58,950
that was the one thing that they sort of,

6373
02:51:58,980 --> 02:51:59,731
that's how they did it.

6374
02:51:59,731 --> 02:52:01,230
Like rockets and like,

6375
02:52:01,470 --> 02:52:01,800
like,

6376
02:52:01,800 --> 02:52:04,560
like new ideas and jet packs and stuff.

6377
02:52:04,710 --> 02:52:06,100
They all like looked

6378
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:08,170
like they belonged in that time.

6379
02:52:08,171 --> 02:52:08,800
They all,

6380
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:09,880
they didn't have the,

6381
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:12,910
the sleekness of a Cadillac STSV you know,

6382
02:52:13,030 --> 02:52:17,330
they had that weird sorta
a rounded bulbous look of,

6383
02:52:17,331 --> 02:52:17,670
uh,

6384
02:52:17,670 --> 02:52:17,910
the,

6385
02:52:17,910 --> 02:52:21,340
the 1950s era or rocket man
was even earlier than that.

6386
02:52:21,341 --> 02:52:21,940
Right?

6387
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:22,773
Yeah.

6388
02:52:22,930 --> 02:52:23,620
Look at that thing.

6389
02:52:23,620 --> 02:52:24,910
What happened to make it crash?

6390
02:52:24,911 --> 02:52:26,110
It just crashed or did there was,

6391
02:52:26,120 --> 02:52:27,710
are fired that started or as,

6392
02:52:27,711 --> 02:52:28,450
good question.

6393
02:52:28,450 --> 02:52:29,283
I didn't remember anything.

6394
02:52:29,420 --> 02:52:31,570
I think it caught on fire when it
was in the air and then it crashed.

6395
02:52:33,280 --> 02:52:34,113
Does it say,

6396
02:52:34,450 --> 02:52:35,040
well,

6397
02:52:35,040 --> 02:52:36,700
three hours the dirigible,

6398
02:52:37,610 --> 02:52:39,110
the dirge doubles.

6399
02:52:39,640 --> 02:52:41,170
That sounds like somebody
doing your underwear.

6400
02:52:42,590 --> 02:52:43,480
You Dick Leaks.

6401
02:52:44,340 --> 02:52:46,360
Like I got a dirge of Belem
in front of my underwear.

6402
02:52:46,361 --> 02:52:47,194
Dude,

6403
02:52:48,550 --> 02:52:49,210
I can't,

6404
02:52:49,210 --> 02:52:50,260
I got to come out naked.

6405
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:51,580
Cause if she sees my underwear,

6406
02:52:52,360 --> 02:52:54,280
especially if you have white underwear,

6407
02:52:54,281 --> 02:52:55,300
you're taking chances.

6408
02:52:56,130 --> 02:52:58,110
Dubai's white dudes who
buy white underwear,

6409
02:52:58,120 --> 02:52:58,953
stop it.

6410
02:52:58,960 --> 02:52:59,793
Okay.

6411
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:00,910
The front of your Dick,

6412
02:53:01,090 --> 02:53:01,571
you're pissed.

6413
02:53:01,571 --> 02:53:03,280
Flap is always going to be leaking.

6414
02:53:04,090 --> 02:53:06,430
You don't do that good
job of wiping your ass.

6415
02:53:07,340 --> 02:53:08,740
She walking around with white underwear.

6416
02:53:08,741 --> 02:53:09,700
You're a silly person

6417
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:12,393
that said,

6418
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:15,580
really should take
better care of your ass.

6419
02:53:15,790 --> 02:53:16,080
You know?

6420
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:16,913
And maybe,

6421
02:53:17,110 --> 02:53:17,943
maybe if he just,

6422
02:53:18,580 --> 02:53:20,580
if everybody had those
Japanese toilets in it,

6423
02:53:20,581 --> 02:53:21,970
every place we went to,

6424
02:53:23,530 --> 02:53:24,363
I went to way

6425
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:26,780
video game thing the other day too.

6426
02:53:26,781 --> 02:53:27,200
Um,

6427
02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:27,321
uh,

6428
02:53:27,321 --> 02:53:31,130
this company to they're doing for my new
show and like were there put me inside

6429
02:53:31,131 --> 02:53:32,450
of a virtual reality situation.

6430
02:53:32,480 --> 02:53:33,050
Oh cool.

6431
02:53:33,050 --> 02:53:33,883
It's pretty bad ass.

6432
02:53:34,070 --> 02:53:35,030
But when I went there,

6433
02:53:35,031 --> 02:53:36,380
they had one of those Japanese toilets.

6434
02:53:36,480 --> 02:53:37,400
It cleans your asshole.

6435
02:53:37,670 --> 02:53:39,710
No blow suppose fog on you.

6436
02:53:40,030 --> 02:53:44,170
Somebody posted this one that they haven't
Chicago and the airports now where it

6437
02:53:44,171 --> 02:53:46,780
has like Saran wrap that
every time you flush it,

6438
02:53:46,781 --> 02:53:50,890
it flips around like this protective
layer that goes over the toilet seat with

6439
02:53:50,891 --> 02:53:52,600
like a Saran wrap type thing.

6440
02:53:52,601 --> 02:53:54,160
So you always have like a fresh thing.

6441
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:55,543
That's nice.

6442
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:57,260
All right.

6443
02:53:57,260 --> 02:53:58,093
Half a minute.

6444
02:53:58,370 --> 02:54:00,500
Now if they can only figure out
how to do that on airplanes,

6445
02:54:01,180 --> 02:54:01,590
there's those,

6446
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:04,370
the stanky as Dank is fucking toilets.

6447
02:54:04,371 --> 02:54:05,204
You ever shit in?

6448
02:54:05,810 --> 02:54:06,770
Oh there it goes.

6449
02:54:06,800 --> 02:54:07,633
Look at it.

6450
02:54:08,450 --> 02:54:09,021
Oh my God.

6451
02:54:09,021 --> 02:54:09,380
Look at it.

6452
02:54:09,380 --> 02:54:10,290
Just inflame.

6453
02:54:10,370 --> 02:54:11,810
Oh my God.

6454
02:54:11,870 --> 02:54:13,760
People running screaming.

6455
02:54:15,800 --> 02:54:16,551
Oh my God.

6456
02:54:16,551 --> 02:54:17,121
Look at that thing.

6457
02:54:17,121 --> 02:54:18,320
Bland flames.

6458
02:54:20,360 --> 02:54:21,141
Oh my God.

6459
02:54:21,141 --> 02:54:22,330
Look at those people running out of the

6460
02:54:22,390 --> 02:54:23,171
bottom of it.

6461
02:54:23,171 --> 02:54:23,620
Yeah.

6462
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:24,790
Oh my God.

6463
02:54:25,570 --> 02:54:25,841
Oh,

6464
02:54:25,841 --> 02:54:28,060
you watched people burned
to death in this thing?

6465
02:54:28,061 --> 02:54:28,930
I didn't know that.

6466
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:30,700
Holy Fuck,

6467
02:54:30,701 --> 02:54:31,534
man.

6468
02:54:31,690 --> 02:54:34,630
You can see people moving in
the fire trying to get out.

6469
02:54:36,970 --> 02:54:39,160
Oh my God.

6470
02:54:39,190 --> 02:54:40,600
That is insane.

6471
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:43,873
Ooh.

6472
02:54:46,870 --> 02:54:48,800
You know that's the first time
I've ever seen that in full.

6473
02:54:49,020 --> 02:54:49,351
Yeah,

6474
02:54:49,351 --> 02:54:49,551
it's,

6475
02:54:49,551 --> 02:54:50,050
it's pretty.

6476
02:54:50,050 --> 02:54:50,883
There's a,

6477
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:53,220
I think even a better version of that.

6478
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:54,150
That might be the only one,

6479
02:54:54,151 --> 02:54:55,890
but maybe I saw a fake one.

6480
02:54:56,010 --> 02:54:57,150
Holy Fuck.

6481
02:54:57,920 --> 02:54:58,800
I swear there was a difference.

6482
02:54:58,910 --> 02:54:59,701
Why don't you people die?

6483
02:54:59,701 --> 02:55:02,740
Even people that died a long ass time ago
when you know you're watching them got

6484
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:03,593
die.

6485
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:05,263
That's not fun.

6486
02:55:05,940 --> 02:55:06,773
The creeps me out.

6487
02:55:07,070 --> 02:55:07,903
Yeah.

6488
02:55:08,090 --> 02:55:09,800
Especially that way those people cooked.

6489
02:55:10,520 --> 02:55:12,350
That was a weird ball of fire too,

6490
02:55:12,351 --> 02:55:12,531
man.

6491
02:55:12,531 --> 02:55:13,430
That was enormous.

6492
02:55:13,530 --> 02:55:16,400
That's like a building
that's made a fire and it's,

6493
02:55:16,401 --> 02:55:16,581
you know,

6494
02:55:16,581 --> 02:55:17,341
I mean it literally,

6495
02:55:17,341 --> 02:55:18,080
it was that big.

6496
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:18,410
It was like,

6497
02:55:18,410 --> 02:55:20,240
like a giant skyscraper made a fire.

6498
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:21,273
Yeah.

6499
02:55:21,290 --> 02:55:21,561
Yeah.

6500
02:55:21,561 --> 02:55:22,370
Whoops.

6501
02:55:22,370 --> 02:55:23,450
We don't do it that way anymore.

6502
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:24,171
Hey,

6503
02:55:24,171 --> 02:55:24,531
you live,

6504
02:55:24,531 --> 02:55:26,270
you learn demand.

6505
02:55:26,710 --> 02:55:27,290
Got a crick,

6506
02:55:27,290 --> 02:55:28,610
crack a few eggs to make an omelet.

6507
02:55:30,050 --> 02:55:30,320
Alright,

6508
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:32,570
you fucks things over.

6509
02:55:32,630 --> 02:55:33,740
We're going to bring the sucker home.

6510
02:55:34,100 --> 02:55:34,610
Uh,

6511
02:55:34,610 --> 02:55:36,920
Brian and I started out three years ago,

6512
02:55:37,190 --> 02:55:41,030
a fucking around at my
house on a laptop and,

6513
02:55:41,031 --> 02:55:41,570
uh,

6514
02:55:41,570 --> 02:55:42,160
now,

6515
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:42,410
uh,

6516
02:55:42,410 --> 02:55:47,360
three years later it's become some strange
thing that's probably pretty much out

6517
02:55:47,361 --> 02:55:48,740
of our control now at this point.

6518
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:50,600
It's Kinda got a life of its own.

6519
02:55:50,990 --> 02:55:51,740
Um,

6520
02:55:51,740 --> 02:55:52,573
and uh,

6521
02:55:52,640 --> 02:55:52,940
I,

6522
02:55:52,940 --> 02:55:57,940
no one thought it was coming and neither
Brian nor I planned on it being wheat.

6523
02:55:58,550 --> 02:56:01,610
I never would have thought we'd had a
studio or never would have thought it'd be

6524
02:56:02,060 --> 02:56:06,020
almost a million people downloading some
of them in that sometimes more than a

6525
02:56:06,020 --> 02:56:06,620
million.

6526
02:56:06,620 --> 02:56:07,453
It's,

6527
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:09,140
it's real weird and a,

6528
02:56:09,141 --> 02:56:13,490
this show a that we did this weekend at
the state theater sort of highlighted

6529
02:56:13,491 --> 02:56:14,030
that.

6530
02:56:14,030 --> 02:56:14,863
And uh,

6531
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:15,770
man,

6532
02:56:15,770 --> 02:56:16,221
I tell you,

6533
02:56:16,221 --> 02:56:17,300
I don't even know.

6534
02:56:17,510 --> 02:56:18,070
I,

6535
02:56:18,070 --> 02:56:20,540
I don't even believe it's real sometimes.

6536
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:21,771
It's very strange.

6537
02:56:21,771 --> 02:56:23,870
When Joey Diaz went on
stage at the state theater,

6538
02:56:24,650 --> 02:56:25,251
I swear to God,

6539
02:56:25,251 --> 02:56:26,480
I didn't even believe it was real.

6540
02:56:26,750 --> 02:56:31,430
I wish I'm kicking myself that I didn't
film it because he went on stage and

6541
02:56:31,431 --> 02:56:34,820
that place fucking corrupted it.

6542
02:56:34,821 --> 02:56:35,810
W it was like,

6543
02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:38,120
it was like Elvis came into
the building or something.

6544
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:38,811
It was nuts,

6545
02:56:38,811 --> 02:56:39,440
man.

6546
02:56:39,440 --> 02:56:42,140
Joey Diaz in New Jersey and you know,

6547
02:56:42,560 --> 02:56:44,030
everybody knows he's from North Bergen.

6548
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:45,230
They,

6549
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:46,580
they went insane.

6550
02:56:46,820 --> 02:56:47,330
It was like,

6551
02:56:47,330 --> 02:56:49,070
there was so happy to see him.

6552
02:56:49,610 --> 02:56:50,960
It was a for real,

6553
02:56:50,961 --> 02:56:54,980
it was one of the most incredible
sets I've ever seen anybody have.

6554
02:56:55,490 --> 02:56:55,791
It was,

6555
02:56:55,791 --> 02:56:59,450
it was beautiful to watch just
watching him go out there.

6556
02:56:59,900 --> 02:57:01,250
What the fuck is going on?

6557
02:57:02,930 --> 02:57:04,250
We just appreciate the fuck out of it.

6558
02:57:04,280 --> 02:57:06,140
We never saw this coming and uh,

6559
02:57:06,620 --> 02:57:07,940
everybody keeps saying the same thing.

6560
02:57:07,990 --> 02:57:08,360
Uh,

6561
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:08,631
Hey,

6562
02:57:08,631 --> 02:57:08,961
don't,

6563
02:57:08,961 --> 02:57:09,794
don't stop doing it.

6564
02:57:09,800 --> 02:57:10,491
Don't stop doing this.

6565
02:57:10,491 --> 02:57:11,324
We're not going to stop.

6566
02:57:11,330 --> 02:57:11,930
Don't worry.

6567
02:57:11,930 --> 02:57:12,763
We're not stopping.

6568
02:57:13,010 --> 02:57:14,810
And all the people that you say that,

6569
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:15,171
you know,

6570
02:57:15,171 --> 02:57:15,410
that,

6571
02:57:15,410 --> 02:57:19,700
that tell us it changed their life
and that finally you have a positive

6572
02:57:19,701 --> 02:57:22,220
influence and we appreciate
the fuck out of that.

6573
02:57:22,250 --> 02:57:23,210
We never saw it coming,

6574
02:57:23,211 --> 02:57:27,350
but we appreciate the fuck out of it
and we take great responsibility for the

6575
02:57:27,351 --> 02:57:28,010
whole thing.

6576
02:57:28,010 --> 02:57:28,880
I'm the male Oprah.

6577
02:57:29,150 --> 02:57:29,983
Okay.

6578
02:57:30,080 --> 02:57:30,913
That's how we're doing it.

6579
02:57:32,600 --> 02:57:33,433
But not,

6580
02:57:33,440 --> 02:57:34,310
I mean cash wise,

6581
02:57:34,311 --> 02:57:38,060
I mean I'm trying to positive
but not always positive.

6582
02:57:38,090 --> 02:57:40,220
Sometimes I'm a little cunty.

6583
02:57:40,760 --> 02:57:40,941
Oh,

6584
02:57:40,941 --> 02:57:41,970
you have a delicious place.

6585
02:57:42,050 --> 02:57:42,561
Hey,

6586
02:57:42,561 --> 02:57:43,430
settle down.

6587
02:57:44,330 --> 02:57:44,661
So,

6588
02:57:44,661 --> 02:57:45,380

6589
02:57:45,380 --> 02:57:46,190

6592
02:57:48,230 --> 02:57:48,501
we're,

6593
02:57:48,501 --> 02:57:50,900
we're all a part of this fucking weird
thing and I know that sounds very

6594
02:57:50,901 --> 02:57:51,830
pretentious to say,

6595
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:53,150
but that is the case.

6596
02:57:53,180 --> 02:57:53,391
You know,

6597
02:57:53,391 --> 02:57:53,651
there's,

6598
02:57:53,651 --> 02:57:55,040
there's no getting
around it at this point.

6599
02:57:55,041 --> 02:57:58,310
We can't really dance around in to call
and anything other than what it is.

6600
02:57:58,370 --> 02:57:59,140
It's a,

6601
02:57:59,140 --> 02:57:59,780

6602
02:57:59,780 --> 02:58:00,170

6607
02:58:05,191 --> 02:58:05,401
