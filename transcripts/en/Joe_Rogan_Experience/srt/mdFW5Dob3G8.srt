1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,780
Try by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,660
That's a weird thing to
see someone have that.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,230
Cause there's a,

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,070
there's an amazing like confidence
that you have to have a or like,

5
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:11,904
uh,

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,070
at least you have to get
yourself to that place.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,970
And it took like,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,301
you know,

9
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:16,470
compete in MMA like you said,

10
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:17,850
without looking at the side of the road.

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,530
And when you see that broken,

12
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,341
I mean when I saw that,

13
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:20,550
uh,

14
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,530
that Ellen interview with Rhonda Rousey,

15
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,171
Yeah.

16
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,450
That was so crazy to me.

17
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,720
That really made me go like maybe she
shouldn't fight for a little while.

18
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,710
Like I dunno,

19
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,981
I like,

20
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:30,960
she needs some more time off because this,

21
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,370
she went from being the like,

22
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,690
I'm going to kill everyone.

23
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,980
No one has a right to beat me.

24
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:35,701
Don't be a B,

25
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,481
nothing bitch.

26
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:38,670
And being that chick to being like a,

27
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,930
I wanted to kill myself.

28
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,210
I got to just have Travis
Brown's babies and I was like,

29
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:43,170
Whoa,

30
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,830
she's gone from being
this like untouchable.

31
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:47,881
I mean,

32
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,280
not even like she was like
the best female fighter.

33
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:50,731
It was like,

34
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,270
don't even,

35
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,440
she's wrecking chicks in a second and
then to seeing her kind of broken,

36
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:55,721
well,

37
00:00:55,721 --> 00:01:00,180
it's interesting is these themed play
themselves out over and over again.

38
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,890
And the traps are all there,

39
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,490
but everybody keeps going for the candy
and they keep getting caught in the

40
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:06,324
traps.

41
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,110
The traps of Hollywood are always
there for any superstar athlete,

42
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,550
especially fighters.

43
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,331
And you know,

44
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:16,080
we've seen it all throughout history with
Tommy Morrison gets in the rocky movie

45
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,750
and all of a sudden everybody's looking
at him like Tommy Marson is going to be

46
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,500
the white hub.

47
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,380
And then Ray Mercer beats
the living fuck out of them.

48
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,510
And you just saw like fear and
overwhelming anxiety attack him.

49
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,180
Cause he's in this movie and he's on
the red carpet and everybody's saying,

50
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,170
you're going to be the champ one day.

51
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:31,391
Huh?

52
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:31,651
I was like,

53
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:32,484
Oh fuck.

54
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,900
And then it becomes this whole thing.

55
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,280
He's hanging with Sylvester Stallone.

56
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:38,640
They're probably doing blow and bang
and hookers and allegedly allegedly.

57
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,301
But you know what I mean?

58
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:41,670
It's like it becomes this Hollywood trap.

59
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,020
And Rhonda was a g and
still is a giant superstar,

60
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,380
right?

61
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,690
She's this undefeated women's fighter.

62
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,580
She's crushing all the competition.

63
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,780
She looks like a destroyer.

64
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,420
And then the fucking traps this,

65
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,310
all these movies started coming out,

66
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:56,990
all this,

67
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,740
all these deals start getting made.

68
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,030
Books start getting written.

69
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,570
All these television shows and all this
stuff and all the traps and all those

70
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:04,260
traps,

71
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,820
they keep your focus.

72
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,760
They take steal little bits of your focus.

73
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,020
Like I'm good enough to get
by without all that focus.

74
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,250
But there's no way,

75
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,500
because there's another
person like you out there,

76
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,000
there's,

77
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,220
there's a lot of people like you out
there and they don't have those traps.

78
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,040
And if they don't have those traps are
going to have more attention that's being

79
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,641
paid right away.

80
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,730
They had an advantage because they
have their full focused on this.

81
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,780
And then there's also something
dangerous to someone like Ron Torres.

82
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,180
But by the way,

83
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,500
obviously it's just incredible.

84
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:28,651
I mean,

85
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:32,010
she's the reason why
women's MMA is a huge thing.

86
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,303
Uh,

87
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,350
but I think there's something dangerous
about being such an amazing grappler,

88
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,760
getting a couple knockouts and all of
a sudden feeling this kind of like,

89
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,030
oh yeah,

90
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,271
you know,

91
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:45,300
she got the knee to a McMahon
and stops it with one knee.

92
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,760
And then what was the other chick who she,

93
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:49,770
she hit the overhand who
face planted Alexis Davis.

94
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,250
Yeah.

95
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,470
And so now it's kind of going in there
and even going in there with like a world

96
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,270
class,

97
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,080
a boxer,

98
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,430
like a Holly Holm,

99
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,780
she kind of goes in there with like,

100
00:02:57,781 --> 00:02:57,901
well,

101
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,950
I can knock people out.

102
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,060
And I think that's a dangerous,

103
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,451
you know,

104
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:01,661
all,

105
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,770
you know what is a dangerous combination
being a blue belt and you chuck got a

106
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,750
bunch of white belts and
you think you're the shit,

107
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,720
and then all of a sudden you're rolling
with Damien Maia and he wraps you up

108
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:10,970
like a Christmas present.

109
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,620
Beats the fuck out of you and chokes you.

110
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:14,060
Unconscious Z,

111
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,650
you know?

112
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:14,880
I mean,

113
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
there's levels of everything.

114
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:21,210
And to deny those levels because anybody
who looked at her fights would see

115
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:21,391
like,

116
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:21,601
okay,

117
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,490
you have this Rhonda Rousey.

118
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:28,491
This fierce competitor was one of
the best judo examples of judo.

119
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:29,760
We've ever seen an MMA.

120
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,020
I mean her judo spectacular reason why
she was a medalist in the Olympics.

121
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,171
I mean,

122
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,930
she's a sensational competitor.

123
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,170
Her grappling is outstanding.

124
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,630
Her arm bar technique is
amongst the best in the world,

125
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,450
but she's knocking out these girls there.

126
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,230
There's no,

127
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,950
they're nowhere near Worldclass as
far as like kickboxing is striking is

128
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,271
concerned.

129
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:48,600
Right.

130
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,180
Holly Holm is 100% worldclass.

131
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,940
She is an 18 time world boxing champion.

132
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,421
I mean,

133
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:55,650
she's a kickboxing champion.

134
00:03:55,651 --> 00:04:00,651
She was in a an MMA competitor
for a couple of years
before she got into the UFC

135
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,440
where she was having these
ridiculous head kick.

136
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,274
Kaos yeah,

137
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,080
she's a beast and for her to think
that she's going to treat this woman,

138
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,340
this Holly Holm woman,

139
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,090
the same way she was able to bully
like Batchko Heyah and I say Billy,

140
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:15,721
not in a negative way.

141
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:18,750
I mean just just attacker
and go after [inaudible] hey,

142
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:19,410
I was,

143
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,130
she's slow and awkward
and not that athletic.

144
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,180
Holly Holm bounces around that
cage like a fucking kangaroo.

145
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,430
Yeah.

146
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,150
She does all these back flips and shit.

147
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,000
She's spectacular.

148
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:33,720
The athletic and the idea that you're
going to have the same approach they used

149
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:34,300
on Batchko go,

150
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,860
hey,

151
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,880
with someone like Holly Holm,

152
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,960
that's just madness.

153
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,260
And that's something that happens when
people get so absorbed with this idea

154
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:41,160
that they're special.

155
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
So absorbed with this idea that,

156
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,081
you know,

157
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:43,950
when you're on top,

158
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,500
you think you are the fucking person.

159
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:47,101
You're the woman,

160
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:47,880
you're the man,

161
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,780
you're the shit.

162
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,980
No one's going to fuck with you.

163
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,270
I'm just wandering through this bitch.

164
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,810
Yeah.

165
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,760
And then you get cracked
and then you realize,

166
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,061
oh,

167
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,830
this game doesn't give a fuck.

168
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,140
This game doesn't give a
fuck about your charisma.

169
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,330
It doesn't give a fuck
about the Vegas odds.

170
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,060
It doesn't give a fuck about how much
money you made or how many times you've

171
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,220
been on entourage.

172
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,280
That's the amazing,

173
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,380
it's an amazing thing about MMA.

174
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,140
It's why I have so much respect
for everybody who competes.

175
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:15,210
But it's like no one can
escape this game's wrath.

176
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,490
No,

177
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,880
I mean like John Jones still has a
lot of his career to go and he does,

178
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,020
he has one loss on his record,

179
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,160
but it was not dominant,

180
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:21,520
you know,

181
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,270
when,

182
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:22,990
uh,

183
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,381
but you know,

184
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:24,191
you see these guys,

185
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,160
like you see Anderson
Silva and he's just like,

186
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:27,761
he's a Ninja.

187
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,421
He's untouchable.

188
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,290
He's the greatest fighter ever.

189
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,740
And then you see him like crying
on the ground with a shattered,

190
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,311
not shattered,

191
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,701
but whatever.

192
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,830
When he broke his shin.

193
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,011
Well,

194
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:39,040
how about when cried in the ground
after he won against Nick Diaz?

195
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,650
He fell to the ground cried ever.

196
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:41,981
By the way,

197
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:42,814
Nick Dsi just,

198
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,570
it's pretty awesome.

199
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:43,870
I mean,

200
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,030
the Diaz brothers are just the
greatest fighters of all time.

201
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,923
They certainly are.

202
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,890
Um,

203
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,191
yeah.

204
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,760
But yeah,

205
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,150
well,

206
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,480
from going full circle then when he
comes back and wins in the octagon.

207
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,811
But I mean,

208
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:52,961
it's,

209
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:53,560
it's,

210
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,520
it's an incredible thing.

211
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,241
It makes you look,

212
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:55,481
I mean,

213
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,010
when watching chuck owl who I just,

214
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:58,281
you know,

215
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,091
at a certain point you were like,

216
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:00,380
that guy's just unbeatable.

217
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,390
He's like Superman.

218
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,980
And then to see him get knocked
out and kind of his chin,

219
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,843
you know,

220
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,103
slowly start to go,

221
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,490
yeah,

222
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,323
it's,

223
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:07,971
it's like this,

224
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:08,780
this game,

225
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,180
this game doesn't give a fuck,

226
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,900
doesn't give a fuck about your opinions.

227
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:15,650
Doesn't give a fuck about what you think
when knuckles hit Chin's legs go limp.

228
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,850
And that's just how it goes.

229
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,860
And we saw that in the
Rockhold Bisping fight,

230
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:19,671
you know,

231
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,540
Rockhold had this look about him
that almost like he was bored,

232
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,763
that he was just like,

233
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,281
I'm going to go.

234
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:25,670
I mean,

235
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,110
part of that I'm sure as gamesmanship,

236
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,020
he's trying to get inside Bisping's
head that he's so much better than him,

237
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,140
that he doesn't even have to
be serious and be concerned.

238
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,340
And then Bisbing clips him with his
left hook over the shoulder where he's

239
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:38,270
barely seen it.

240
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,130
I said,

241
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,771
you called it,

242
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:41,330
it was a great cause what you said,

243
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,010
like a few beats before that we were like,

244
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:46,040
Luke Rockhold keeping his chin right on
up in the air and he's kind of like a

245
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,090
little lacks of days ago.

246
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,331
Yeah,

247
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:47,901
I remember you,

248
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:48,230
uh,

249
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,651
in the,

250
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:49,484
um,

251
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,890
in the Hennen Borow Dillashaw fight.

252
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,960
The first one was like a huge upset.

253
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,920
No one saw that coming.

254
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:55,580
Uh,

255
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,300
and I remember you,

256
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,740
you sang as it was,

257
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,400
you're like,

258
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,640
man,

259
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,540
Dillashaw is really light
on his feet too much.

260
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,610
I was really relaxed.

261
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:05,540
Like sometimes you could just see a
little thing in the way they're moving.

262
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,171
They were like,

263
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:06,351
hmm.

264
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:07,430
That's kind of interesting.

265
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:07,820
Yeah.

266
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,910
I was telling you before
we started recording my,

267
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,600
my buddy hilarious comedian,

268
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:12,291
one of my best friends,

269
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,160
Lewis j Gomez,

270
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,670
he does a radio show with
Michael Bisbing and uh,

271
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,300
you've had a big J.

272
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,960
I'm going gonna show the three of us
do a podcast and a legion of skanks.

273
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,260
You,

274
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,160
you got to have Lewis on.

275
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:22,760
You'll fucking,

276
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,510
I would love to,

277
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,590
he's like Jay.

278
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,160
Yeah,

279
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,460
Jay.

280
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:25,851
Jay's a,

281
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:26,930
I've got a special coming out,

282
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,760
which is going to be just incredible.

283
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:30,380
It's it on comedy central hour.

284
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:30,560
Oh,

285
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:30,811
cool.

286
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:31,644
I'll coming out on,

287
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,493
I believe,

288
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,550
I want to say June 17th,

289
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,350
but I might,

290
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,440
it's like one of those days,

291
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,810
it's called a live at Webster hall.

292
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:41,270
It's going to be a fucking
incredible special look for that.

293
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,850
Jay is like one of the funniest
comedians on the planet.

294
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,713
Very funny.

295
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,330
Louis J.

296
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,890
Gomez is just one of the funniest
people I've ever met in my life.

297
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,671
He's a great comedian.

298
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,500
He's like bigger than a standup comedian.

299
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,660
He's like the Bert
Kreischer of the east coast.

300
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,970
He's just a hilarious person.

301
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,840
Uh,

302
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,820
but so he's doing a show
with Michael Bisbing.

303
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:02,240
They do a show called the countdown on
Sirius Radio and he started doing the

304
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:02,390
show.

305
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,200
I mean this is before Bisbing has the
Anderson Silva fight and it did almost

306
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,290
seem kind of like Brisbane
was a great fighter,

307
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,140
a big name,

308
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,110
but seemed like he was kind of
going toward the end of his career.

309
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:13,430
Like it had a couple injuries,

310
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:15,140
had the eye thing and you're kinda like,

311
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,740
oh he was,

312
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,790
he was a contender.

313
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,390
Well explain the,

314
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,051
I think cause the,

315
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:18,980
I think is pretty bad.

316
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,191
Yeah.

317
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:22,790
You probably know better than he has a
detached retina and he has oil in his

318
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,624
eye.

319
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,020
They had to inject oil into where his,

320
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:29,630
I sit so that his retina won't tear again.

321
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,760
So he has one eye that looks almost like
cross side and it's kind of black like

322
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,930
is like he's on ecstasy,

323
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,490
like one pupils dilated.

324
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,510
It's very weird and he
doesn't give a fuck.

325
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,540
He's got that one I fucked up
and he doesn't give a shit.

326
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,470
He's still going in there and
soloing and then is born for this.

327
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:48,770
This,

328
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,770
this mother fucker went out and fought
Anderson Silva won one of the gutsiest

329
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,070
performances I've ever,

330
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,363
and I mean he,

331
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,760
the,

332
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,610
the first two rounds that he beat
Anderson were just incredible.

333
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,050
And then the fact that he got almost
put out in the third round and came back

334
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:07,380
and won the fourth round and it was a
fucked up for him because he was trying to

335
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,740
say that his mouthpiece was
out and he tried to circle to,

336
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:11,880
I don't know who the referee was.

337
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:12,620
I think it was herb.

338
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,110
Yeah.

339
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,943
And he's like,

340
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,641
but Herb's like,

341
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:14,880
look,

342
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,541
it doesn't matter.

343
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,200
Like you got to,

344
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,951
I'm not stopping that.

345
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:17,161
You don't,

346
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:19,020
you can't call when to stop the action.

347
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,110
Cause you could say that the mouthpieces
out or you could just spit your

348
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,150
mouthpiece that whenever someone's,

349
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,420
you know,

350
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,390
like landed a big show,

351
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,120
people do time and people do do that.

352
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,051
But you know,

353
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:28,561
herb was like,

354
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:28,711
look,

355
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:31,260
you can't say to me that
your mouthpiece out,

356
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:33,480
I know your mouth pieces out
but you've got to keep fighting.

357
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,500
Then boom,

358
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:38,010
Anderson lands off flying me on the jot
and then Anderson walks away with his

359
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:38,610
hands up.

360
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,040
It's so crazy as if he won so crazy.

361
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,360
Herb didn't call the fight yet.

362
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:43,290
So then the bell rings.

363
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,900
So then Bisping has to get up and
recover in a minute from getting k Oud.

364
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,020
It was madness.

365
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,340
He got a little bit of extra time
because Anderson Silva celebrated.

366
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:53,671
Yes.

367
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:55,800
So I think he got like an
extra 30 seconds or so.

368
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,670
But I mean,

369
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,271
but then right.

370
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:57,391
So,

371
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,224
and by the way,

372
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,090
that's got to fuck Anderson
up to cause Anderson's,

373
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:01,980
now I've got this like
adrenaline dump and then he's,

374
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:02,880
and then you saw on his face,

375
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:03,121
he's like,

376
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:03,540
Whoa,

377
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:03,871
no,

378
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:04,870
we're back to fighting it.

379
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,330
But Bisbing man,

380
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,320
that fourth round,

381
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,510
he just bit down on his
mouthpiece and walked him down.

382
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:10,950
And yeah,

383
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,790
I mean it was incredible.

384
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,330
Crazy.

385
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,540
And then after that being the
greatest ever to come and,

386
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,351
and you get on a,

387
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:17,250
on an injury,

388
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,130
you get a title shot with 10 days' notice.

389
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,630
He fights the greatest ever.

390
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:21,901
I mean,

391
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:25,200
arguably Anderson's on the
downslide but definitely,

392
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,190
let's not say arguably,

393
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,150
I mean losing twice to Weidman and it
just didn't look the same when he fought

394
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,820
Nick Diaz suspended for steroids,

395
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:34,620
comes back and you know,

396
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,630
but he's still Anderson Silva.

397
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,300
So that victory gets that victory
over the greatest of all time.

398
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,550
And then first round
knockout over Luke Rockhold,

399
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,821
you know,

400
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:42,271
it's fucked up.

401
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:42,660
I was,

402
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,380
I was literally considering saying that
Luke Rockhold looks overconfident and

403
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,360
when you're overconfident
you can get knocked out.

404
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,021
And I'm like,

405
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:49,854
I don't want to be a deck.

406
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,180
And then boom,

407
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,014
he gets knocked out.

408
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,840
But you did make the
comment about him holding a,

409
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:58,470
about him not having his head right there
on the center line of sort of relaxed.

410
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,120
It was super relaxed with
his chin straight up.

411
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:02,400
He was pulling out of things
with his chin straight up.

412
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:04,050
It's almost like there was no danger.

413
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,590
Yeah.

414
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,900
And that was one of the things
that he was saying that,

415
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,471
you know,

416
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:08,400
he was in no danger.

417
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,700
And it was also one of the same things
that your Riaa Faber was saying.

418
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,470
Like the difference
between me and cruises,

419
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,370
I can hurt him,

420
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:15,390
I can take him out.

421
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,520
And then when you see
your riot got caught,

422
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,570
I think it was a second round,

423
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,940
he got dropped and you
realize he's in deep trouble.

424
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,661
Like you realize,

425
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:22,530
Holy Shit,

426
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,840
I can get knocked out too.

427
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,730
And all those guys in,

428
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:25,981
you know,

429
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:26,111
it's,

430
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:26,790
it's uh,

431
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,750
it's funny when you get it,

432
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,950
like Michael Bisman is a guy who,

433
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:29,880
the knock on him,

434
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,920
I guess was that he didn't have
knockout power or whatever.

435
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,540
You're talking about like a a 200 I mean
fighting at two oh five I got it cuts

436
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,380
down probably,

437
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:37,741
I'm sorry,

438
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:41,790
one 85 so probably something someone
who weighs close to 200 pounds.

439
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,480
It's a 200 pound guy who specializes in,

440
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,301
in striking.

441
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:45,640
Yeah.

442
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,390
I mean he can fucking
knock you out of course.

443
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,260
And he proved it.

444
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,040
He doesn't,

445
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,690
he doesn't fight like a,

446
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,930
like a brawler like he fights like a
technician and when you fight like a

447
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:56,764
technician,

448
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,360
you don't swing wild crazy ass punches
with everything on them with your,

449
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,140
you know,

450
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,580
Vandelay Silva style,

451
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,061
you know,

452
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:06,520
you try to find openings
and that's what he did.

453
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,890
He found the opening with that
left hook was really sneaky.

454
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,210
He had missed it before.

455
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,230
He was like stepping in and throwing the
left took over the shoulder and kind of

456
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:15,610
like stepping into the punch.

457
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,710
And boy when he caught Luke,

458
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,510
he caught him at the end of the chin,

459
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,790
which really like fucking spins your head.

460
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,010
All the Torque is perfectly placed.

461
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,520
And then he caught him with another
brilliant one right afterwards.

462
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,190
Followed up.

463
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,850
Yeah man.

464
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,390
Dude.

465
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:28,691
And you know,

466
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:31,360
he's had like all sorts
of fucking crazy injuries.

467
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:32,230
Back injuries,

468
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,310
neck injuries is fucking army.

469
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,260
Yeah,

470
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,400
he's just tough man.

471
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:37,300
He just keeps going.

472
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,410
It just keeps going.

473
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,210
She has no question about that.

474
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,710
That dude's as tough as they come in.

475
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,181
I don't know.

476
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:45,490
I've never fixed him just because he's
one of those guys who's like been around

477
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,410
forever and always kind of
been knocking at the door.

478
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,550
So it's nice to see him,

479
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:48,791
you know,

480
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,950
get his moment was crazy to see.

481
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,750
Well you see like there's knockout power,

482
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:53,051
right?

483
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:56,600
And then there's like Dan Henderson kind
of knock out power that was just like,

484
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,130
she's fucking cry.

485
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,740
Like 10 Anderson feels like this
table when you put your arm on him,

486
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,030
he's not flexing.

487
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,133
He's like the,

488
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,550
like Ryan Parsons,

489
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,420
who's a buddy of mine,

490
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:08,950
who was his manager for a long time,

491
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:11,980
said that he would do massage on
him and he would be exhausted.

492
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:12,221
He's like,

493
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:14,530
he's would you guys made out of wood?

494
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,880
So like when you look at him,

495
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:16,271
you'll get him,

496
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:16,421
he go,

497
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,380
well it looks like a,

498
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:17,831
you know,

499
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,180
strong athletic guy.

500
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,740
But if you felt him,

501
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,380
you realize where all
this power comes from.

502
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,140
He's like,

503
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,160
he's built different,

504
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,680
there's something going
on with him and he does.

505
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,940
When you were saying people who
don't put everything into one punch,

506
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,840
he puts everything into it.

507
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,530
I mean it's like coming at Ya and it's
so weird the way he moves to moves in a

508
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:37,420
weird way because he's very stiff.

509
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,070
He's not fluid like John Jones or like
Anderson is very fluid in his movements.

510
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,750
Dan is like very stiff,

511
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:46,810
but when he uncorked those bombs on you,

512
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:49,450
they just detonate and you're just like,

513
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,890
what the fuck hit me?

514
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,361
Like heck.

515
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:54,790
The lombards never been knocked out to
see Hector Lombard get knocked out by,

516
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,380
well he got head kicked.

517
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,830
He's probably stunned by that head kick
and then he got blasted with that back

518
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,450
elbow and he was out cold.

519
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,170
He was out cold when he hit the ground
and then Henderson blast them again.

520
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,131
But like,

521
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:06,970
Whoa,

522
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,580
I saw,

523
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:07,871
I was like,

524
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,920
who the fuck hits?

525
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,360
Like this guy is like,

526
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,990
it's almost like you want him to hit you.

527
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:12,910
It just so he could feel it

528
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:14,891
harder.

529
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,300
Is that the normal like what it,

530
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,440
what the fuck are you doing?

531
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:21,250
I want to start by like standing next to
a guy who he had hit him real close to

532
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:21,341
me.

533
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:22,174
I want to feel it.

534
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,970
His Kale,

535
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,400
if Bisping UFC 100 was one of the most
brutal one punch shots and the history of

536
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,240
combat sports,

537
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,660
it was just boom Bisping's dead stiff,

538
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:36,130
and then Henderson's airborne long before
the referee can get to them and just

539
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,710
slams him in the face on the way down.

540
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,210
And then from there out,

541
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,600
one of his logos was the silhouette of
him flying through the air and knocking

542
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,443
out Bisping.

543
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,840
So imagine being best bang.

544
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,770
Not only do you have to deal with the
fact this guy fucking knocked you out in

545
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,920
spectacular fashion,

546
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:56,921
but his logo is flying to the air,

547
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,780
hitting you after you're
already unconscious.

548
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,200
I would,

549
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,033
I would just say,

550
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,121
hang on.

551
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:06,470
In a few years you'll be champ and you'll
have a show with Lewis Jake Omens and

552
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:07,280
everything will be good.

553
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,160
What year was UFC 100 it's a wild man.

554
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,240
That was Brock Lesnar.

555
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,450
I want 100 yeah,

556
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,101
100 yeah.

557
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:13,934
100 was like,

558
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,630
was it 2012 no,

559
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,411
earlier than that,

560
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:18,980
probably.

561
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,180
What year was that Jamie?

562
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,150
I just pulled something up.

563
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,270
It wasn't UFC one 14 popped up.

564
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:24,961
It wasn't definitely,

565
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:25,650
wasn't that right?

566
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,670
It was UFC 100 yeah.

567
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,733
Let me see.

568
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,090
Okay.

569
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,090
It was the biggest paper view of all time
was Brock Lesnar's rematch with Frank

570
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,750
Mir GSP photo Tiago album 2009 2009 wow.

571
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,740
It was that long ago.

572
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,633
Whoa.

573
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,110
That's nuts.

574
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:43,650
Yeah,

575
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,481
that was fucking weird.

576
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:46,790
It's been a long fucking
longer than I would've thought.

577
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,360
Yeah,

578
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,781
definitely.

579
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,520
I guess it is like a hundred UFC is later.

580
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,210
Yeah.

581
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:50,600
Wow.

582
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,520
So seven years later he wins a title.

583
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,893
Crazy.

584
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,921
You're a look.

585
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,600
There's going to be the same,

586
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,520
same card on the same card,

587
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,181
right.

588
00:15:59,181 --> 00:15:59,420
You guys,

589
00:15:59,420 --> 00:15:59,571
look,

590
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:00,800
there's gonna be some ups and downs.

591
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,750
Your retina is going to
get all types of fucked up,

592
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,170
but you will be champion one day and
no one takes that away from him ever.

593
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,910
Could you imagine if him and
Henderson had a rematch for the title?

594
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,970
Good Lord.

595
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,020
Can that be made?

596
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,270
I wonder if that could be made ethically,

597
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,490
because if you look at
all the other contenders,

598
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,510
all the people waiting in line,

599
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:19,781
Chris,

600
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:21,140
while you're in Morocco,

601
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,260
Jacques Perrey Vittorio,

602
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:24,094
there's just too many.

603
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,760
Yeah,

604
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,541
there's too many,

605
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,330
but two who,

606
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,163
boy,

607
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,090
it's hard.

608
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,170
It's a hard sell because Vito or just
knocked out Henderson the first round,

609
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,760
you know it's handy.

610
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,171
Yeah.

611
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:39,760
It's just man vitro knocked out Bisbing
and Brazil and here knocked out Rockhold

612
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,960
but he just got smashed by Jacques Perrey.

613
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,410
Everything in the middleweight division
is just completely up in the air and

614
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,680
it's all,

615
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,520
it's all turned up to that.

616
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:49,331
So weird in MMA,

617
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:49,901
will it happen?

618
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:50,734
Like you're kind of like,

619
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:50,921
oh,

620
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:51,221
okay,

621
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:52,770
I think I know where everything's sounds,

622
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,340
and then one thing changes and I'm like,

623
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:54,700
well,

624
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,600
I don't know anything.

625
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,140
I guess.
