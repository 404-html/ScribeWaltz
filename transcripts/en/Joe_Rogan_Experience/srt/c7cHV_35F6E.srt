1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,790
Yes,
slow down Twain,

2
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:05,280
slow down.
You have an orange watch.

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:07,320
You are a fucking,
what is the orange thing?

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,410
I've always been attracted to orange.
I grew up in Colorado,

5
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,510
so the broncos orange is always been
around me.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,270
Ah,
so the favorite uninjured hurdle at the

7
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:18,870
time was Michelangelo with the orange
and then a really no other fighters or

8
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:20,160
gyms.
We're using orange,

9
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,870
so I wanted to make sure I did my own
thing.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,640
That is your own point.
Yes sir.

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,250
Orange.
I mean it's like I absolutely love

12
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,350
orange,
but I see some orange at the store or a

13
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,460
crowd of people.
I see what warrant.

14
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:29,851
Sure.
I'm,

15
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:30,720
I just goes boom.
Right.

16
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,670
If there's a fruit bowl,
there's an orange right next to a

17
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,360
banana.
Orange grabbed the orange.

18
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,230
Tj,
what is it like being around this guy?

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,101
Oh,
it's intense,

20
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:38,790
man.
I limit,

21
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,440
you know,
life's full of energy.

22
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,420
You know,
you can't be calm around him because

23
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,280
he's got enough energy for both of us,
you know?

24
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,790
Yeah,
no,

25
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,720
he's,
he's a mad man.

26
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:48,000
We worked out today and he's in the
middle of like training.

27
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,100
He just gets excited.
So it's hit this past year.

28
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,670
I love it.
I don't ever have to do road work

29
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,680
because of this guy,
you know?

30
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,080
I mean we hit Mitts for so long and so
hard that I'm in too good a shape

31
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:58,800
already.
You know?

32
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,110
That's interesting.
Like all the footwork drills and

33
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,280
everything.
I never really thought of that.

34
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:03,890
Like you probably don't have to do road
work.

35
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,070
I it'd be too much.
I have,

36
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,350
I do too much training as it is.
If I'd started doing roadwork,

37
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,450
I think I'd overtrained myself.
That's,

38
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,060
that's fascinating.
What you have to kind of regulate that,

39
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:12,894
huh?
Like there's,

40
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,930
there's a,
a standard model that like a lot of

41
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:18,030
fighters fall and roadwork is a big part
of that.

42
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,070
But do you think that with all the stuff
that you do,

43
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:21,900
if you did that as well,
it might be too much.

44
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,880
It'd be too many,
too many hours put into the day.

45
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:25,620
I'm just too tired by the time I get
home.

46
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,200
Or I'd have to say,
I mean I could do it on the out of camp,

47
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,330
you know,
just to keep my mind right and kind of

48
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:32,990
get some zen going.
But during campus too much I,

49
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:35,370
I train too much to be able to have to
have to run as well.

50
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,640
It's funny because everybody's got a
different sort of way of doing it.

51
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,450
Like Jeremy Stevens was on the podcast
recently and one of the things that he

52
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:46,200
was saying is that he really ramped up
is running to the point where that,

53
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,300
what he was saying is that having like
this like long endurance base really

54
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:55,280
helps him and fights because he knows
that he is always going to recover.

55
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,600
You can always push further and harder.
To me,

56
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,270
he seems like it kind of fighter that
does need to build on the cardio

57
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:00,960
anyways.
You know,

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,560
I feel like each person's body is gonna
react differently to training and I'm

59
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:07,530
someone that has endless cardio.
I feels like when I'm fighting and

60
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,090
training.
So I need to stay more,

61
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:12,630
a little more fast twitch and I'm always
putting size on instead of losing it.

62
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:16,940
And I feel like Stevens has been trying
to drop weight and get smaller and it

63
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,120
helped with his weight cut.
I'm sure.

64
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,710
Yeah.
I think it helps with his weight cut her

65
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,780
Bra.
But I think with him it's also like a

66
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,760
mental thing too.
He wants a break guys.

67
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:26,910
Like he's such an aggressive guy.
Like that's a big part of like it's

68
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:29,460
training.
It's just being able to like have those

69
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,190
extra gallons and the gas tank.

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,620
Absolutely.
I mean I think that's what,

71
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,780
it's kind of hard.
It's hard for me to run because of my

72
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,010
mind.
So crazy though to like,

73
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:38,844
I'll go,
I'll,

74
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,370
I'm all over the place.
I would rather hit mitts and be

75
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,170
aggressive.
I'm too too aggressive of a person I

76
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:45,150
guess.
But we were talking before the podcast

77
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:48,390
about our friend campaigns just ran 200
miles and we're like,

78
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:51,840
that shit is not good for you to no way.
No Way.

79
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:53,460
That's not good.
Your body's not supposed to do that.

80
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,970
It might be good for his brain though
cause he's so fucking crazy.

81
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,620
Like,
he needs to know that he can do

82
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,370
something like he ran for 78

83
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,050
hours.
That's why I want to hunt with him.

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,030
Cause I,
I just know it's like my dad,

85
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,320
my,
when I grew up hunting,

86
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,040
we'll go hike a hundred miles in a week
to go,

87
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,350
go out the back country and have a
backpack and sleep out in the middle of

88
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,730
the woods.
I just feel like that's how cameron

89
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,511
hanes would do it,
you know,

90
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,720
just as hard as possible just to just to
do it.

91
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,660
Yeah.
My friend Adam Green tree from Australia

92
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:23,710
came over,
flew over to America last week,

93
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,920
went to Montana and then hiked some
crazy amount of miles into the

94
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,460
mountains,
uh,

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,850
camped out when in deeper and deeper
cause he kept encountering wolves and

96
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:37,240
Grizzly bears camped out there,
shot an elk.

97
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,510
And for the last four days has been
packing out this elk by himself.

98
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,740
Wow.
Four days.

99
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,500
So if you've never shot an elk or you
ever seen an elk before,

100
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,080
folks and elk could weigh,
you know,

101
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:54,460
somewhere around 800 pounds,
which is probably around 400 pounds of

102
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,690
meat that he's packing out.

103
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,050
So four days of a hundred pounds on his
back.

104
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,560
When we are in your hiking,
you can't carry it all.

105
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,420
You got a quarter it out.
So not only say you hike five miles with

106
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,980
some of your back,
you had to go back and get the rest of

107
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:08,660
the Elta height that five miles again.
So you're hiking the same trail,

108
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,240
a trail,
you know,

109
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,841
two,
three,

110
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:13,150
four times depending on how big Dell,
cause you know when you're quartered

111
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:13,691
out.
Yeah.

112
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:16,420
And he's pretty sure he said he hiked 12
hours.

113
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,910
So that could easily be,
you know,

114
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:21,100
who knows how many miles at high
altitude,

115
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:25,420
I'd imagine a puzzle.
So he's got a hundred pounds on his back

116
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,100
for 10 hours.
12 hours a day for four days in a row.

117
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,270
Yeah.
That's an engine.

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,770
That's a workout.
I feel like there's,

119
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,210
I feel like there's nothing better than
that.

120
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:37,090
It's so primal hunt with a bow out in
the middle of nowhere.

121
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,140
Especially,
I mean by herself.

122
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,270
That's crazy.
Well y'all,

123
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,320
he'll also,
you could get them on instagram.

124
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:45,400
Adam Green tree bow hunter on instagram.
He documented at all,

125
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,250
you know what the instagram stories.
So he was there.

126
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,790
There is a,
and a dude met him up there,

127
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,880
a friend of his,
a hiked through the night to come and

128
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:58,330
meet him up there and help him I think
on the third or fourth day.

129
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,390
But uh,
he's got all these videos of him up

130
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:03,320
there in the mountains.
That's an awesome picture.

131
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,480
Yeah.
It's just,

132
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,820
it's just so cool because I mean,
he's just out there survive.

133
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:09,820
Look at this.
We're looking right now for folks at

134
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:13,120
home listening.
We're looking at this tent that's

135
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:16,720
covered in snow,
the grounds covered in snow and uh,

136
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,880
this is where he's been living for the
past week.

137
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,870
And that is the high country because
when you're a public land,

138
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,790
most countries don't or most,
yeah.

139
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,200
Most countries don't have the same sort
of public land set up that we have in

140
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:31,000
the United States.
We can just go hike into the mountains

141
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,880
and camp out and these national forests.
And so,

142
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:34,451
uh,
he,

143
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:36,220
uh,
took advantage of all that and he's up

144
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:37,150
there.
Oh,

145
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,070
where's it savage Australia.
Oh,

146
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,640
okay.
Okay.

147
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,270
That's right.
Yeah.

148
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,490
All you have to do is come to Montana.
You buy a tag.

149
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,790
I think attack for an elk is 1000 bucks.
And you know,

150
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,310
he's up there with a,
a pistol because there's bears up there.

151
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,330
So his,
his,

152
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:50,710
uh,
his kill site,

153
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:53,170
a bear came in on his kill site when he
came back.

154
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,290
There was a grizzly there and there's a
lot of grizzlies in Montana.

155
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,670
Um,
uh,

156
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,100
Mendez

157
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,800
was just up in Alaska and got an awesome
Mousse and a,

158
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,180
his story's pretty cool too.
What?

159
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:04,850
He got a real big moose.
And then over the night and camp,

160
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,390
a grizzly bear came in and tried to take
his moose off and took a big chunk out

161
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,080
of its neck.
Yeah.

162
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:12,590
So it is his whole story of what he's
got going up there.

163
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,210
It's pretty cool.
Yeah.

164
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,630
Went on an awesome hunt and she'll hold
wow.

165
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,240
Look at that thing.
Yeah.

166
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,400
So we're looking at Chad Mendez is it
says a 63 inch do it yourself.

167
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:25,160
Alaska Moose Hunt is now live on his
youtube channel,

168
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,650
63 inches,
the width of the horns,

169
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,120
which is just insane.
That's insane.

170
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,860
That is an enormous animal.
So if an elk is 800 pounds,

171
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,820
that's probably like 1500,
1600 pounds.

172
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,320
That's an enormous animal.

173
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,000
And he goes through guided hunts,
right?

174
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,620
Yeah.
He just guides.

175
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,610
Yeah.
He guides people.

176
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,140
That's his passion.
Yeah.

177
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:48,420
That's what he wants to transition to
after he's done fighting.

178
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,420
That's where his passions at and he's
extremely good at it.

179
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:53,370
So no reason not to.
That's cool.

180
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,121
Well,
here's a question.

181
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:58,170
He got popped for some supplement thing.
Like one of the in a lot of people were

182
00:06:58,171 --> 00:07:02,370
getting popped for tainted supplements.
If you buy things in the store,

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,790
there's a lot of supplements that you
get like at any,

184
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,320
any nutrition store that have all these,
uh,

185
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,940
like if they're not steroids,
they're peptides.

186
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:15,000
There are all these things that sort of
make your body produce more hormones

187
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,700
that are real legal by Usada.
And,

188
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:19,680
uh,
he got caught for that stuff apparently.

189
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,050
Is that what he got caught for?
That they proved it.

190
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:22,950
That it was a supplement.

191
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,730
Oh really?
Yeah.

192
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,170
Oh cool.
I haven't really asked them too much

193
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,490
about it.
It's a bummer.

194
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,900
That's good.
At this level you have to be made.

195
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,050
It would be mindful of what you're
taking into the body.

196
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,390
So especially with the new guidelines.
So it's just part of following the

197
00:07:33,391 --> 00:07:34,820
rules.
Can't go in the Cajun.

198
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,750
I poked some way,
but go.

199
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,730
I didn't know.
Now there's so much going on with the

200
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,990
supplements now you have to make sure
you put it in the research and

201
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,610
investigation.
Speaking in your body.

202
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,520
I poke in.
Did you see that picture of Travis

203
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,640
Brown's finger knuckle deep into
febreeze over dooms eyeball?

204
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,630
He didn't even say anything in the fight
right there for doom.

205
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,960
I don't remember seeing Verdomme Call
Hall.

206
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,490
I don't remember.
I did see that jump,

207
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,170
that jump psychic in the beginning of
the hand on his trainer like crazy.

208
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,980
It was a cool,
without that fight there was cool.

209
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,110
It was a cool fight.
Well,

210
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:06,720
it was,
it was a bomber to me to see Travis

211
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,840
fight like that,
because I remember travis earlier in his

212
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:13,830
career was just to look at that picture.
That is fucking insane.

213
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,550
Esther,
Esther Lynn from all elbows on

214
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,010
Instagram,
put this picture up and,

215
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:21,330
um,
she's an mma,

216
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:23,430
a photographer.
She takes awesome pictures,

217
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,260
a picture.
And this is insane.

218
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:27,930
I mean,
it is literally knuckled deep in his

219
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,490
eyeball.
It just,

220
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,080
it's hard to look at,
man.

221
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,891
It's just,
Oh,

222
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:33,480
my knuckle though too.
Right?

223
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:36,930
There's middle knuckle.
His finger has disappeared in the

224
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:39,240
eyeball.
I don't remember him stopping or saying

225
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:41,220
I poke or anything.
I don't remember either.

226
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,590
Let's focus.
But there was a bad one earlier in the

227
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,740
night with Jimmy Rivera and a Uriah.
Yeah.

228
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,830
That was a bad one.
And Jimmy Rivera after the fights that

229
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:51,740
he couldn't see,
he still couldn't see.

230
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,770
He's like,
he said,

231
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,970
he couldn't tell what color things were
out of his right eye.

232
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,810
Yeah.
Fucking I blokes,

233
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:58,920
man.
Pride gloves,

234
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,480
Huh?
On the gloves.

235
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,250
A little bit of a car to turn there.
And that opened all the way.

236
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,061
Sorry.
No,

237
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:03,894
I think you're right.
Yeah.

238
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,880
Most of the time,
this is what I do.

239
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,490
I obsessed about marshmallows to making
things better.

240
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,340
Someone's got to do something because
the way things are going,

241
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,400
we're just so many guys are getting,
I go so many guys getting damaged

242
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:15,510
eyeballs.
It's just,

243
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,270
it's not worth it man.
And it seems like we're waiting for

244
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,310
something terrible to happen.
You know?

245
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,760
Like look at Michael Bisping,
I dunno.

246
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,280
Bisping's came from a kick though.
I feel like it might've come from

247
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,670
vittores kick.
What was it that or was it in practice?

248
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,560
I don't know.
Do you think it was in practice?

249
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,050
I think he detached his retina a couple
times,

250
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:35,670
so I think that's why it is the way it
is.

251
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,000
I think he's heard it multiple times and
it was kind of where it,

252
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,490
because it's not completely fixed.
I think they fixed it enough to where he

253
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,710
can fight and then when he's done
fighting they'll probably fix is I

254
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,870
completed these,
what it seems like what they did is they

255
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,020
stuck oil in his eye.
I don't understand it,

256
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:54,050
but one of his eyeballs apparently has
oil in it that's protecting the retina.

257
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,270
So that's why one of his eyeballs is
black,

258
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,433
like,
you know.

259
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,880
Yeah.
I was wondering what was going on with

260
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:00,750
designs.
That's why.

261
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,970
Yeah.
One is black and one is his original

262
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:04,230
ICO,
which I'm not sure what it is,

263
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,480
but it's very strange looking,
but it's just,

264
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,280
he's a fucking savage.
I mean,

265
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,990
he didn't even consider retiring.

266
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,421
He's like,
Hey,

267
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:11,490
yeah,
stick some oil in there.

268
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,860
Let's get going.
We didn't reckon do put an eyepatch on.

269
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:16,020
Let's do this.
Got To get back to the gym mate.

270
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,410
He does push it.
That guy comes to fight.

271
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:24,030
He said Animal Michael Bisping is the
middleweight champion of the world.

272
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:25,410
And who saw that coming?
He did.

273
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,693
He did.
Yep.

274
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,700
I seen that opening and uh,
and uh,

275
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,200
luke rockhold to instagram videos
leading up to the fight.

276
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,720
I seen the same thing his trainer saw.
Really?

277
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,070
Yeah.
He was leading it back.

278
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,490
He was telling me weeks before the fight
that thinks he was doing,

279
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,680
while he's hitting Mitts,
dropping his right hand all the time

280
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,620
with his left cross and kind of leaning
back and kind of shoulder roll and,

281
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:45,810
and whatnot.
And Duane called it out a couple of

282
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,370
weeks before the fight that he saw
openings.

283
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:48,450
You know,
he didn't say he was gonna get knocked

284
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,920
out with it,
but he saw some openings there,

285
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:50,860
you know,
is there,

286
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,200
I mean that's,
it's pretty simple.

287
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,270
We can see where the openings are on
that one for sure.

288
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,970
And uh,
I remember after bisbing caught him and

289
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:59,280
his trainer point Adam,
and I'm not quite sure what he said and

290
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:00,790
left him,
but he was for sure saying like,

291
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,441
see,
I told you,

292
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,540
I told you I like that one.
Yeah.

293
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:04,951
Yes.
Yeah.

294
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:07,050
He's a good boxing coach.
He understands the game.

295
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,350
I got respect for that guy.
Um,

296
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,660
but it's cool to see something you've
trained multiple times come out and

297
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:14,280
actually work.
And then when the fight and then the

298
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:15,610
title fight.
Ooh,

299
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,860
that's,
that's nice.

300
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:20,580
That's rewarding.
And along the lines of like what we were

301
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:24,840
talking about today when we were working
out is there's so much depth to this

302
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,480
sport.
There's so many options and there's so

303
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:30,540
many possibilities that to the outside
or people look at it,

304
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,520
it looks brutal.
You see that I poke and you're like,

305
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:34,290
oh my God,
this sports should be illegal as much.

306
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,260
Correct.
But to a person who really understands

307
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,140
and watches it and appreciates it,
it's like there's so,

308
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,790
it's like this crazy language that you
have to learn with all these different

309
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,670
words and all these different ways of
putting together sentences.

310
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,640
And I like to use the language analogy
because I'll give,

311
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:53,710
you're talking to someone and they only
know a few words and want to yell at

312
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:56,110
you,
but you're like some Sam Harris type

313
00:11:56,111 --> 00:12:00,040
dude who can just has an incredible
language and you're just so eloquent.

314
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,630
He spin them up like a web and they
don't really don't know what the fuck to

315
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:08,290
say.
And that also happens in a fight when a

316
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,920
guy has a very simple,
like real obvious game.

317
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,450
He does a couple of things and he does
it well as long as you engage him in

318
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,370
that same sort of simple,
obvious way.

319
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,250
He's got a chance.
But when you over flood,

320
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,150
I'm like,
Dwayne,

321
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,630
this Duane was showing me this switch
series that he works on,

322
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:27,070
which is really amazing.
Really,

323
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,540
really interesting stuff.
Thank you sir.

324
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,840
But one of the things I noticed is while
you were demonstrated to me,

325
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,980
because it's so unusual if forced my
brain to hiccup for a second ago.

326
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,940
Oh,
okay.

327
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,990
And if that happens in a fight,
you're Foxville oh right.

328
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,460
Oh yeah.
100% those little hiccups.

329
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,830
Right.
Those little moments where your brain is

330
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,530
overloaded because it's got to think
instead of just react because you're

331
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:48,430
doing something unique

332
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,970
thinking inside the octagon,
you're going to get caught,

333
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,470
you're going to be in trouble.
It's,

334
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,590
you need to have a completely clear mind
and just kind of react to things.

335
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:57,840
And for me,
it's just been kind of having fun out

336
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:58,171
there.
You know,

337
00:12:58,171 --> 00:13:00,360
the more fun I have and the more loose I
stay,

338
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,880
the better I'm going to fight.
If I go in there with a game plan and

339
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,370
thinking of what I want to throw in,
what to watch,

340
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:07,020
watch out for what he's good at,
what he's not good at,

341
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:08,790
then I'm going to be a little bit
slower.

342
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,260
You know,

343
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,490
we were talking about your fight with
dominick Cruz that you seem so emotional

344
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,290
like you want it to kill that dude like
you were.

345
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,240
So I mean I definitely want to kill him.
You know it was so hot.

346
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,690
I mean it was obvious you were,
you were head hunting as opposed to like

347
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:27,230
one of the things that I really enjoyed
about what your first and your second

348
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:29,930
fight with Hanan Barao but your first
fight with Hanan Barao was like,

349
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:32,840
here you are fighting for the title.
And he was like,

350
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:35,630
you're on a sparring session.
You were just so loose.

351
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,260
Like right away you can throw every,
there's nothing and attention to what

352
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:41,870
you were doing.
Everything was like flowing and I was

353
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,180
like,
look how well he's responding to the

354
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:45,690
pressure.
You were having a great time out.

355
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,953
Yeah,
exactly.

356
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,280
Not,
not thinking about it,

357
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,720
you know.
And like you said with the Cruz thing,

358
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,740
I want,
I wanted to finish him.

359
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:52,270
I want him to go out there and put a
point on it.

360
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,190
And uh,
you know,

361
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,690
things you learned from those are,
those are the small mistakes you learn

362
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,580
from it and you change them up next time
and you,

363
00:13:57,581 --> 00:13:59,130
uh,
come out there a little more level

364
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,440
headed and uh,
you know,

365
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,170
play his game.
That kind of like you were saying,

366
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,701
you know,
he,

367
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:04,180
he's a point fighter,
you know,

368
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:06,490
and if you go out there and let him
point fight you,

369
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,050
then that's what he's going to do,
you know?

370
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,910
Um,
so you've got to be able to react to how

371
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:11,620
he fights it and change it up a little
bit.

372
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:13,540
And that's why each training camps a
little bit different.

373
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,800
And you learn those

374
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,440
things,
you know,

375
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,440
when you go and watch a fight after it's
over,

376
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,600
do you see openings and you're like,
shit,

377
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,060
yeah,
that's called regret.

378
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,443
Sorry.
Yeah,

379
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,590
100%.
You'll,

380
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,580
you'll see it in the,
uh,

381
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,710
you'll all get,
I'll start sweating because I'm getting

382
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,300
mad that I didn't do something
correctly.

383
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,950
You know,
like in the end of the first round,

384
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:37,460
I was watching the fight against Cruz
and I had a double leg locked up so deep

385
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,740
and I just didn't finish it.
And that could have changed an entire,

386
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:41,590
the entire fight,
just one take down the beat.

387
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,580
In the first shot I was all the way
deep,

388
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:45,500
hands under his butt perfectly.
I just stand,

389
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,930
pinch my elbows to finish it.
So I went to lift him and he slid right

390
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,360
through my arms.
One difference I had to make was

391
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:51,870
pinching my elbows and you know,
it

392
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,340
changes it just one of those things in
the moment.

393
00:14:55,341 --> 00:15:00,341
Isn't it fascinating how like you have
to train perfectly and then you have to

394
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,200
just let everything go automatic.
Yeah,

395
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,850
that's exactly it.
You just,

396
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,450
you hit the nail on the head is to train
everything perfectly.

397
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,560
Now it comes down to quality reps,
but then what's a quality rep hitting in

398
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:13,870
that?
Getting here or getting them to take

399
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,020
down,
not getting taken down,

400
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:15,801
things like that.
Right.

401
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:19,370
So now it comes to the,
the point of adapting to the athlete in

402
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:23,870
the scenario and what's correct.
Again is making sure they have high

403
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,450
success with that technique,
whatever that technique may be.

404
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,880
So just putting in,
putting in the time that reps till it

405
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,100
comes out fluidly and there's no longer
a thought,

406
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:35,000
but the instant reaction.
Well and also having the right coaches

407
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,530
to give you that information and can
give you that high level technique

408
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:42,440
because there's so many people out there
that are talented people,

409
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,360
but you see their game just doesn't
evolve.

410
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,170
It just hits this level and it's sort of
like the level that their coaches are

411
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:51,440
capable of taking them to and then they
don't go any further.

412
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,470
And in that code you have to believe in
trust and that coach will take you to

413
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:55,460
that level of someone.
I mean,

414
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,650
someone can be telling you the exact
thing you need to do,

415
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,000
but if you don't trust and believe that
guy,

416
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,250
if he doesn't get it through your head
the right ways,

417
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,930
then it's not going to make sense.
You know,

418
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,150
you're not gonna,
you're not gonna do it cause you don't

419
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,380
believe in it.
Well,

420
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:11,300
I think it's amazing what's going on
right now with MMA that people who are

421
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,720
casual people like,
um,

422
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,350
perfect example,
the other day I was at my daughter's

423
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:20,351
school and one of the dads came up to me
and this dude was just a new fan.

424
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,460
He'd only been watching mma for the past
year and he was just rapid firing

425
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:28,010
questions at me and he was obsessed with
it.

426
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:29,570
He's like,
I was never into martial arts when I was

427
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,360
a kid.
I watched a little bit of boxing and

428
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:34,880
he's like,
but man that UFC has just got me hooked.

429
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,650
And he's like,
one of the things that I love about it

430
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:39,590
is how many different ways of fight can
end.

431
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,790
He's like,
it's just,

432
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,900
it's so crazy.
Like you'll,

433
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,870
you'll watch a fight and then all of a
sudden the guy's getting choked.

434
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,600
Just like what happened?
And we were going over this,

435
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,441
uh,
about it.

436
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,410
And this guy was a real smart guy.
I think he's like a hedge fund manager

437
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,620
or something like that.
But he was obsessed with all the

438
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:56,360
possibilities,
you know?

439
00:16:56,361 --> 00:17:00,770
And I think casual fans are starting to
understand now that this is a very

440
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,060
intellectual pursuit.

441
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:07,160
If you don't have a strong mind and if
you don't have this full range of

442
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,560
options and possibilities inside the
octagon,

443
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,260
you're most likely limiting yourself.
Agreed.

444
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,250
Agreed.
I see that.

445
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,650
Yeah.
Possibilities are nice when you change

446
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,371
things up.
And again,

447
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:18,140
like we said earlier,
confused the brain,

448
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,450
get them thinking about something else
and then you do something else.

449
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:23,930
So that's always nice.
But I think right now we're seeing like,

450
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,770
um,
there's a,

451
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,880
there's a pack,
right?

452
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,750
There's like the standard pack of,
of athletes that are doing things in a

453
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:34,520
certain way and then there's a few that
are moving away from the pack and

454
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,870
they're expanding the potential of MMA.
I think you're one of those people.

455
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,621
No,
I appreciate that.

456
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:44,180
And I think you for sure are one of
those coaches and there's a few guys out

457
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,280
there I know you don't like to hear,
but dominick Cruz is one of them.

458
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:49,320
He's also doing it.
And we were talking about him today that

459
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,280
like his style

460
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,530
is so fucking odd.
You know,

461
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,570
like it's technically not sound
actually,

462
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,610
but you know,
but he uses it the right ways.

463
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,980
He's got awesome timing.
Yeah.

464
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:00,870
He's got great cardio,
he's got a great Chin and then you can

465
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,080
get away with the bad things he does.
Cause he does them for the right way for

466
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:04,860
himself.
You know,

467
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,540
I don't necessarily think you can say
it's technically bad because he's so

468
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,930
fucking successful.
Yeah.

469
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,830
And he knows how to do it.
I just think it's not standard.

470
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,410
You know,
like he doesn't like we're using Ramon

471
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:19,050
dekkers as an example.
He does not throw kicks and punches like

472
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,990
Ramon dekkers.
But what he does do is he throws him

473
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:26,070
like Dominick Cruz where he's moving
like a pendulum back and forth and it's,

474
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:30,060
footwork is so weird and he's
overwhelming your mind with

475
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:33,120
possibilities.
And he doesn't do the same thing twice.

476
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,960
He mixes things up so well that he's a
tough nut to crack.

477
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,500
Did he?
He,

478
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,830
he's tricky.
He is trickier than I expected for sure.

479
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,581
But the,
you know,

480
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:42,690
a piece of that,
again,

481
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,170
game planning is the talks up to the
fight to get them emotionally invested

482
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,750
and then it becomes a bit trickier to
find the head.

483
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,460
Right.
So that's the goal.

484
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,650
When you were,
when you were leading up to the fight,

485
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,310
he was talking so much yet and you could
tell that you were getting so upset,

486
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:58,620
but that is a big factor in fights,
right?

487
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:02,700
Because fights are so emotional because
it's one of the only sports in the world

488
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,690
where your health is on the line.
Like literally like this the option,

489
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:10,060
it's not like you might get in a car
accident when you're racing cars that

490
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:14,490
that's a possibility.
But the goal of MMA is for you to fuck

491
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:15,330
up someone's body.

492
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,860
Yeah,
absolutely man.

493
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,870
Um,
the other thing you had with him too

494
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:22,410
that makes it pisses you off so much is
that he'll attack anything and just talk

495
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,360
about some of the,
doesn't even make sense just to talk and

496
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:27,450
talk louder and faster and not,
I'll give you a chance to talk.

497
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:31,200
It's like a high school girls just
bickering at each other.

498
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,090
I think that's what pisses you off the
most,

499
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:34,380
you know,
cause he's not even actually making a

500
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,540
great point.
He's just making it and making it

501
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,170
louder.
Voice.

502
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,520
Very articulate.
Yeah.

503
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,850
It a good good analyst because of that,
you know,

504
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,100
greed.
So my technique,

505
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,180
if you get a chance to find him again
for the title,

506
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,460
I bet which you're in line.
Yeah,

507
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,480
right.
Obviously,

508
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,530
well you lost a very close decision to
him and then you beat hot felon,

509
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:54,140
Sun's out.
Which in my opinion was a,

510
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,480
we were talking about this today was an
excellent example of how far you

511
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:00,390
progressed because you guys had a really
tough fight the first time you fought.

512
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,640
It was a close fight.
This fight was not closed.

513
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:05,430
He just ran away from him and he ran
away with the,

514
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:06,330
uh,
the fight rather,

515
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,060
not run away from him,
but rent.

516
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,933
I mean,
you were just,

517
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,030
it was a clear victory.
It was like you're just were so much

518
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:14,040
more technical.
There was so many more options you were

519
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,790
presenting to him and he was basically
the same fighter that he was back then.

520
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,610
Maybe slightly better.
But you're all way better fun.

521
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,320
I appreciate him and we,
we've worked hard.

522
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,260
We've long hours where it's really hard.
Um,

523
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,570
you know,
it's crazy how the,

524
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,380
like you said,
the sport works out how quick things can

525
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:29,340
change.
You know what I mean?

526
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,630
I could be on 11 fight win streak right
now and a split decision loss to have

527
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:35,070
fail since sal.
You know,

528
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,980
I thought I won that fight.
A very close fight with dominick Cruz

529
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:40,650
that I felt I want as well.
Those two fights go my way.

530
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:42,930
I'm on 11 fight win streak.
You still have the belt,

531
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,330
you know,
known as hopefully one of the greatest

532
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,620
comp pound fighters in the world.
You know,

533
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:47,980
and we have stuff for sure.

534
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,340
What's interesting right now too is this
new rule,

535
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,730
a set that's going to go into place in
January,

536
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,340
you know,
a where they've changed this whole thing

537
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,260
about down fighters like being able to
attach it down.

538
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,400
Yeah,
good call.

539
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,360
You have to have four points down now.
So if you,

540
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,800
yeah,
if you put a hand down on the ground and

541
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,410
someone kicks you,
that's,

542
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,860
that's totally legit now.
Which I think it's long time coming.

543
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:13,970
I think that's a,
I'm a little bummed out that didn't give

544
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,080
her of the 12 six elbow but you know,
whatever,

545
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,440
which is one of the most ridiculous
rules cause that's really not going to

546
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,840
hurt you anymore than me putting a shin
across your face,

547
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:25,170
you know,
like crazy or getting neat in the face

548
00:21:25,171 --> 00:21:26,550
and crushing your skull.
Yeah.

549
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,340
That stuff happens all the time and now
you're going to take away an elbow and

550
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:31,150
you can't even really generate that much
force with,

551
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,590
I don't feel it's not more forest.

552
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,330
Yeah.
I mean I think there's way more forced

553
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:38,380
than the elbow that comes down the side.
Cause it's more like a punch because

554
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,240
you'll get your whole shoulder torques
into it.

555
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:42,580
Your shoulder dropping down is a weird
movement.

556
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,520
I mean,
I guess there's some guys like Anderson

557
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,250
Silva or you know,
yachts and Cli or some badass tie

558
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:50,470
fighters that can generate ridiculous
power with that.

559
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:53,050
But I don't think it's any more than any
other kind of elbow.

560
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,340
Absolutely not.
No Way.

561
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,270
It's just some of the rules I think are
a little bit archaic I think.

562
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,640
I think we all agree though.
The the,

563
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:00,700
the,
the gloves.

564
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,610
Yes sir.
Probably like if there's going to be

565
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:06,460
like one thing that needs to be changed,
I mean it would be really nice.

566
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,490
We could all get together and figure out
a way to make it so there's less high

567
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,710
pokes and here's three experts in the
field right now.

568
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:16,180
We're all saying no pride style gloves
would be an example or like the shadow

569
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:17,590
gloves,
but anything that it doesn't allow the

570
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:20,200
hand to fully open.
Fuck they own pride.

571
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,620
Just use those goddamn gloves.
Those are the sweetest gloves too.

572
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:26,070
I love the pride gloves.
I collect all kinds of fight

573
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,160
memorabilia.
Yeah.

574
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:28,660
I'm all over the place now.
They're dope man,

575
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:29,620
by the way.
Show everybody your,

576
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,940
your wallet.
Oh yeah.

577
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,380
I'm a boxing coach.
Whitman who is by far the most technical

578
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,060
martial arts I've ever come across.
He took a,

579
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:40,060
an old fight glove and a worth.
The cameras are there.

580
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,700
Made me a wallet out of my glove.
Yeah,

581
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,560
I saw it on.
So dope theft is nice.

582
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:49,180
He uh,
he makes all my,

583
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,240
uh,
my punch punishments but type has met my

584
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,760
belly,
showed my leg kick paths,

585
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:54,550
might kick shield.
I'm super impressed.

586
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,470
I was always impressed with trevor as a
cost.

587
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:58,180
Some get a picture so I'm going to put
that he's just,

588
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,330
he's just an engine.
I mean I'll take that same skill set and

589
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:05,170
put that into martial arts or to
developing technique or drills.

590
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,460
That's the same things that you did that
same information to running a successful

591
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:10,760
business or whatever it is you just
said.

592
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:12,340
Detailed guy.
Yeah.

593
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,720
It's uh,
it's,

594
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:18,580
it's just fun to see someone do
something that's unique,

595
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:20,290
Huh?
So colors,

596
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,680
you guys are in Colorado now.
You moved to Colorado full time,

597
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,690
you know,
how much different is it live in there

598
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:27,570
and what is it like now?
Also your,

599
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:30,670
your training at altitude all the time.
That actually made a huge difference

600
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:34,030
that even taken to account when I first
went out there when I was cross training

601
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:36,970
and I was going back and forth from my
camps going from Sacramento to Colorado

602
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,480
and always going back out there,
it was so tough and,

603
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:42,550
and somebody will get affected by that
to do differently.

604
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,980
You know some like Joseph Benevidez
doesn't get affected by it at all.

605
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,160
I feel like that Mexicans,

606
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,820
he never gets tired.
Mannequins don't get tired.

607
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,680
I don't know some racist things to say
but in a positive way.

608
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,110
Tell you I'm the Mexicans have a fucking
incredible gas tanks and Joseph will

609
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:58,790
come up,
he'll be gone in Vegas,

610
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,130
we'll come out and he'll train exactly
the same for me,

611
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,200
when I go to altitude,
it messes with me big time,

612
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,660
but I feel like I get the effects from
it long,

613
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,250
long term.
When I'm done with the camp,

614
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,060
like I felt big differences when I
trained at w train at altitude,

615
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,880
when I'm done with my camp,
after I've been up there for six weeks,

616
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:15,980
I'm in a camp and you come back down to
sea level.

617
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:17,960
When we first started hitting mitts that
wherever we go,

618
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,640
it just feels awesome.
You know,

619
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:20,990
sea level,
you feel like a superman,

620
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:21,441
right?
Yeah.

621
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:22,940
It's crazy how much of a difference it
makes.

622
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,310
Have you ever tried one of those
altitude tents,

623
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,500
those things that people sleeping?
I have tried it.

624
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,280
It's so hard to sleep in it,
isn't it?

625
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,190
Yeah.
It gets hot in there and then it,

626
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,930
and then your body doesn't recover as
well.

627
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,220
You know,
if you're sleeping,

628
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:36,650
that's really high altitude.
He mean anything higher than we're at.

629
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:39,350
If just even a real high altitude,
it's hard for your body to actually

630
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:41,300
recover overnight when you're actually
supposed to recover.

631
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:42,470
You're supposed to,
you know,

632
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,290
have your testosterone built up when
you're sleeping and oxygen getting to

633
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,920
your muscles and recover over the night.
And if you're sleeping at high altitude,

634
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,780
it's really hard to do that.
You wake up more sore,

635
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,820
you wake up more tired and it's hard to
recover.

636
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,910
Interesting.
So what I had heard was that the best

637
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:00,911
balance was training at sea level,
but sleeping and living at altitude.

638
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,130
I heard that as well.
It seems like it wants to go back and

639
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:05,660
forth all the time.
That's what I heard when I was in

640
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:07,490
school.
You know I was a kinesiology major and I

641
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:10,250
was really into exercise physiology.
They said train low,

642
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:11,400
sleep high,
you know,

643
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,580
so that your body,
when you're sleeping and hanging out,

644
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:14,960
you're rebuilding all these red blood
cells,

645
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,180
but then your threshold or working out
at sea level,

646
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,820
you can push it so much harder.
So your body's used to go in that hard,

647
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,590
you know,
but you,

648
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,110
you're training in lack oxygen,
you can't train as hard.

649
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:27,190
So I mean that makes sense to me.
But then when sleeping in and out to do

650
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:30,350
10 I feel like you can't recover until
you're acclimated.

651
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,250
Once you're acclimated,
you can recover because you have more

652
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:36,200
red blood cells in your body.
But until then,

653
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,920
I wonder if anybody does it where like
you live in San Bernardino and then

654
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,530
train up in big bear and just keep going
back and forth

655
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,770
and then sleep Tito's thing for awhile.
He lived up there though,

656
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,480
right?
First Tito,

657
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,420
you still live up there for his camps.
He was one of the first MMA fighters to

658
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:51,680
incorporate that,
you know,

659
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,810
boss Oh,
Boston,

660
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:55,310
Boston puffers,
heavyweight title.

661
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,760
Uh,
he came to Colorado for his camp for its

662
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,310
fight against Kevin Randleman.
So I sit there Rutan so,

663
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,780
cause uh,
there was a promoter in town that would

664
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:04,340
hold shows.
They were called the lone wolf

665
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:08,900
invitational and uh,
he had a couple shows and then I think

666
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,000
it would be his third show.
Boss was there.

667
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,850
He was just the special guest.
So then the shows after that,

668
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:16,580
we're now at the boss Rutten
invitationals but when he was there,

669
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:18,680
he would,
he would be a special guests of the show

670
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,320
and then he would do a seminar the next
day.

671
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,150
Then I'd fight on the show and then do
with seminars.

672
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:23,984
That's how we,
uh,

673
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,640
came together and,
uh,

674
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:28,130
he noticed the effects of the altitude
and then sweet,

675
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:29,150
just his next camp there.

676
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,890
I wonder if there's a difference between
like when,

677
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:37,891
when I think when they're studying how
athletes perform while they sleep at a

678
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:41,710
high altitude and train at low altitude.
I wonder if there's a difference between

679
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,130
the intensity level that MMA

680
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,850
requires and the amount of like,
I don't think there's a sport in the

681
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:52,800
world that requires you to train as much
as mma because there's so many different

682
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:56,190
things you have to work on or as hard.
Like we just share with a lot of nfl

683
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:58,320
players with Lauren then Dow,
uh,

684
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,131
and,
and Denver,

685
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:02,280
he trains a lot of denver players and a
lot of guys come for before they do

686
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:03,780
their combine and come and train with
them.

687
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,690
And you just kind of realize like how
much harder your shrink conditioning is

688
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,000
and how much harder you have to push.
And that's just one workout,

689
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:11,070
you know?
And then maybe they're going to do some

690
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:14,550
football drills and whatnot and we're
going to hit meds and do some grappling

691
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,410
and wrestling.
And it's,

692
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,170
it's a very tough sport to get ready
for.

693
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:19,410
I mean,
I really don't know if there's many that

694
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:20,850
are as hard or harder.

695
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,230
That's what makes it fun,
Huh?

696
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,870
It's fun to watch.
You know?

697
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:28,200
It's really kind of crazy when you think
about like the 10 minute rounds a pride

698
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,900
had and how difficult five minute rounds
are.

699
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,711
Well,
he definitely needed,

700
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:32,970
if you're a grappler,
I mean,

701
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:34,890
who the fuck is going to beat Damien
Maia if ever rounds,

702
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:35,910
10 minutes.
Good point.

703
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,350
Yeah,
you're going to be worn out.

704
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,660
That guy's a backpack is such,
he's so on another level right now.

705
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,850
That's one of those guys.
It's so good at one thing,

706
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:45,684
but he's,
but he's,

707
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,150
but he's incredible at it that he can
get away with it.

708
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:51,640
Most guys can't get away with just being
good at one individual aspect of them

709
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:53,580
and may,
but he's one of those guys that he's

710
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:55,800
just so dominant at Jujitsu that you can
get away with it.

711
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,020
That's the,
the theory too,

712
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:00,150
or the concept is he's really good.

713
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,560
They were in,
they could choke while a few submissions

714
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:02,370
obviously.
Right,

715
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,460
but let's say you're,
you're just Ninja at the in.

716
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,720
They could choke.
Now that's your one technique.

717
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,240
Now everyone's aware of that.
So I got to do was just have different

718
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:10,940
entries for that rear naked choke.
Right.

719
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,470
So different entries and then obviously
you finished the submission.

720
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:16,770
But as far as the striking concept,
the same techniques or combination,

721
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,600
just different entries in different
exits.

722
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,170
Right.
Again,

723
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,140
that same technique itself.
Yeah.

724
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,160
There was a few guys who have just
really excelled at one particular

725
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:28,080
technique to the point where it gets
ridiculous.

726
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,870
Like remember cody Mckenzie was catching
everybody with that.

727
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:32,600
Mckenzie [inaudible] callback.
Yeah.

728
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,740
Ski Team.
He came and showed it at Alpha male

729
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:35,460
thing.
It's crazy,

730
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,280
but you got to be built for it though.
He's like perfectly built for his arms

731
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,590
are long,
skinny.

732
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:40,930
Well,
uh,

733
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,100
then there was Paul Sas.
Remember Paul says like the triangle 12

734
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,710
fights in a row by triangle and
everybody knew it was coming.

735
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:48,760
He couldn't do shit about it,
but you can get it.

736
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,820
Yeah.
You can use that to your advantage

737
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:53,120
though as well.
So I was helping Matt Brown train from

738
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:56,730
Maya and uh,
I didn't like how he was approaching the

739
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:58,710
fight that he was so worried about what
he was going to do.

740
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:00,390
He's like,
he's going to do these take downs,

741
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:01,980
he's going to take her back.
He's going to do this.

742
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:06,240
Like he was so entrenched in what Damien
Maia was going to do to him in the fight

743
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,950
rather than worrying about what he
should do,

744
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,010
what aspects He should take to the fight
to stay away from his game instead of

745
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:12,360
really what he's going to do.
So,

746
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,000
you know,
you can use that to your advantage if

747
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:16,740
you're a fighter that's so strong at one
thing,

748
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,140
confused someone and get them so worried
about what you're going to do,

749
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:22,020
that they're actually thinking inside
the fight rather than reacting and just

750
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,730
doing what they're good at already.
Cause if Matt,

751
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:25,740
if Matt would have fought,
I feel like the way he should have in

752
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,740
that fight,
he could've picked Damien Maia apart

753
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,323
maybe.
Yeah,

754
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,080
yeah.
Oh No,

755
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,700
he would've got fucking grapple fucked
again maybe later on.

756
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:36,570
But yeah,
that's my hope and thought at least.

757
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:38,130
Yeah.
Well I'm a big map brown fan,

758
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:41,130
but I'm a be Zoe and Maya fan as well.
For me it's,

759
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:41,980
it's weird,

760
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,110
you know,
because I'm a fan of a lot of guys and

761
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:47,710
these guys oftentimes fight each other
and it's just like you just got to

762
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:50,100
appreciate the event and appreciate the
results.

763
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:51,520
Sure.
Appreciate the sport.

764
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,510
It was one of the cool things about mma
is that there are these outliers like

765
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:57,400
this one trick pony,
like Damien Maia.

766
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:00,160
But what a fucking trick.
I mean he's,

767
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,730
I mean he can strike and Damien striking
has gotten leaps and bounds better.

768
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:07,900
It's one of the reasons why he's gotten
so better at applying his Jujitsu is

769
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:11,050
because he's so much more comfortable
with his standup is distance is very

770
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:13,120
good.
Now we understand striking really well

771
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:15,460
now,
but that Jujitsu,

772
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,040
it's just so next level making it
happen.

773
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,860
So he runs through a guy like Carlos
condit like that.

774
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,970
Yeah.
Or out graph was Gunnar Nelson grabbed

775
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,870
his gunner Nelson that easy and you know
all them.

776
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,110
Yeah,
just Malden,

777
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,700
like you said,
at another level.

778
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,490
For sure.
And also goes to show you how fucking

779
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:32,140
good jake shields is.
Oh,

780
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:34,570
you're right.
People sleep on jake shields.

781
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,150
Jake shields beat him in a,
essentially a grappling match,

782
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,980
you know,
and a lot of people forget,

783
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,120
you know,
Jake shields was always a guy who kind

784
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:45,460
of struggled with a standup because he
wasn't like a explosive guy who's just

785
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,450
sort of like comp awkward.
His standup.

786
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,490
Yeah.
Awkward.

787
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:50,560
But again,
he beat Tyron Woodley the fucking welter

788
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:52,600
weight champion.
The world lead them in essentially a

789
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,340
standup file.
So of Nate Marquardt.

790
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,600
Yeah,
she'll just smile with his grappling.

791
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,550
He,
he's coming out the muscle farm,

792
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:00,530
worked out with us and showed some
technique and his top game is just so

793
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,060
ridiculous and he's strength.
It's just all about is positioning the

794
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,100
weighs on you.
It's,

795
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,310
it's so tough.

796
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,440
I mean it's,
it's a chest mass freshman chess match

797
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:09,340
for sure.
Yeah.

798
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:12,100
He gets slept on,
he's fighting Fitch now.

799
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,570
They're going to fight in the world
series of fighting.

800
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,160
That's a very good fight.
Very,

801
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,660
very interesting fight.
That's interesting.

802
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,790
We have bought both ways.
I was wondering about Fitch.

803
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,810
That's good to see him back in there.
Here's a fuck per wall.

804
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,180
Right?
I don't know when the last time he

805
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,390
tested positive after he fought pal
horace.

806
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,080
Oh,
did he?

807
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,060
Yeah,
I thought it was knee got hurt a little

808
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:31,570
bit of that too,
but he tested positive for elevated

809
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:32,770
testosterone.
Oh Wow.

810
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,873
Yeah,
I have that.

811
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,360
You got to follow the rules and the
guidelines.

812
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,190
Rules to happen.
Yeah.

813
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,750
But back to like styles.
It just,

814
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,900
is it just so interesting that there are
so many different styles and there's so

815
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:47,320
many different people like wonder boy,
he's a one trick pony and the other

816
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:48,520
direction,
you know,

817
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,230
just his fucking striking.

818
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,490
It's just bizarre.
And his style is like really a karate

819
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:56,830
based,
almost like a sport karate style.

820
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,380
But it's incorporates the movement in
the operating for a longer distance and

821
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:03,190
he likes to draw people in to get them
extended before he catches himself.

822
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,840
So he's like a Cobra.
Exactly.

823
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,890
Is Movement like his back and forth
pivoting off the waist.

824
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,470
But he also,
he does another thing that fucks with

825
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,070
people is that front leg.
Yeah.

826
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,930
His front leg is so nasty.
I keep when he fought Hendrix,

827
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,910
he hit when a front lake side to the
body and you could see Hendrix got leg

828
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,280
stuck by,
it was a hard shot and you're like kind

829
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:27,370
of acknowledged it and then he got
roundhouse kicked in the face with the

830
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:32,290
same foot like right away.
Zohan in her face all the time.

831
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,360
It just never stops.
Funny to me,

832
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:40,600
a dream fight is Damien Maia versus
wonderboy.

833
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,580
The complete opposite style.
That's a dream fight.

834
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,590
I want to see what the right,
it's like,

835
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,160
I feel like now what we're watching two
with Damien Maia is also,

836
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:52,730
we're watching this master who's 38 Oh,
you're right.

837
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,331
Good point.
Yeah.

838
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:54,540
He's still,
well he's,

839
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,460
he's up there for the competitive ages,
but he seems as healthy and it can

840
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,200
happen.
We said 38 me forever.

841
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,930
It's one of those things where you got
to wonder like how much more sand is

842
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:09,760
left and that hourglass means it pulled
the radica tour trick just fine until

843
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:12,530
he's 50 yeah.
I mean fuck randy almost came out of

844
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,110
retirement for fade or oh nine he was
thinking about fighting.

845
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,240
What am I saying?
That just as an old fight fan?

846
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,190
Yeah,
for sure.

847
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,820
You got to think about that.
My other two being 38 and be able to

848
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:24,080
push it that hard still is it his style
of fighting,

849
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,730
you know,
he's not getting hit very much.

850
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:26,870
He's on your back.
You know,

851
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,520
his training's probably that way as
well,

852
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,970
and so he's able to go a little bit
longer rather than someone that's going

853
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:32,450
to be in front of you and slug it out.
Yeah.

854
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,250
Good point.
He's definitely taking less damage

855
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:37,220
striking wise over the years when Judas
stat on him,

856
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:40,250
when we got hit 13 times over the last
four fights.

857
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,950
No.
Well,

858
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,480
yes.
And like the like it just,

859
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,550
that's in most of them are the Matt
Brown fight.

860
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,593
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

861
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,890
It's just fucking crazy how like
technical he is when it comes to his

862
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:52,720
Jujitsu.
Yeah.

863
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,470
Yeah.
That's why you don't play Jujitsu.

864
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:55,730
Right.
So we've got to punch him in the face

865
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:57,710
while he kicks like nate Marquardt did.
Yeah.

866
00:33:57,711 --> 00:34:00,050
Well nate caught him early in his career
too though.

867
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,720
Still striking up game.
Yeah.

868
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah.
People sleep on nate Marquardt too,

869
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:05,691
man.
You know,

870
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:08,960
people forget how God damn good nate,
especially in his prime.

871
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,990
And you watched that tyron Woodley fight
when you fought him in strikeforce.

872
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,410
He looked really good.
Then you have a nation that he hit him

873
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:17,610
with was like fucking a video game.
Yeah.

874
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,250
Yup.
He was sharp.

875
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:20,750
That's when he was working with the
Trevor Whitman.

876
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:22,760
He's back with trevor as well.
But his name again,

877
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,610
trevor is by far the most technical
detailed,

878
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,040
uh,
martial artist instructor that I've come

879
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,630
across in,
in any field.

880
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,530
He really makes it breaks things down.
And I hear Shane Carwyn is making a

881
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,960
comeback
as well.

882
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:37,730
Yeah,
he's a free agent.

883
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,400
Yup.
So he can go wherever he wants.

884
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,030
Interesting.
Wonder where that's going to go.

885
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,050
Good.
Nice thing.

886
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,060
Is he training with trevor as well?
I'm not sure.

887
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:45,890
I don't actually spend too much time
with trevor,

888
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,870
but uh,
hopefully if he's smart he should.

889
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:49,390
He will.
I know he's really close with the

890
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,440
wrestling coach me at least,
or bullying.

891
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,450
And I've been hearing it from the Easter
that you know,

892
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:56,970
he's a free agent and looking about
getting back into working out and seeing

893
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,480
how his body holds up to see if you know
how he's going to push it and what's

894
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,341
gonna happen.
Yeah.

895
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:03,200
He has some pretty significant back
injuries.

896
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,034
Right?
Yup.

897
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,720
It was his neck.
Right.

898
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,590
I think is,
you know,

899
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,160
you gotta think that guy played football
at a high level for a long time and all

900
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:15,970
that crashing big dudes smashing into
each other.

901
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,610
Those guys are freaking nature's man.
I can't,

902
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:23,270
that's so crazy to be able to be that
big and that fast 230 pounds is run into

903
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:25,790
somebody who's standing there.
It's not good for you.

904
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,010
Yeah.
I definitely not good for you.

905
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,250
You want to stay healthy,
that's for sure.

906
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,750
Yeah.
Cause it goes back to uh,

907
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,710
keep keeping those same rules in line
when you're training that the goal of

908
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,870
the training is to get better,
right.

909
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:38,070
Not to hurt each other.
So just making

910
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,620
sure you're taking care of your partner.
And learn to use this time to improve

911
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,930
and get better and better.
I get the better you get and so on.

912
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,120
Yeah.
And if you can get a good camp like that

913
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:47,670
where everybody has their ego in check
and you all grow together,

914
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,910
that's mass.
Yeah,

915
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,690
no egos there to learn and get better.
Overall,

916
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,120
it's something that I've had to
obviously work on too because I'm so

917
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:56,250
competitive and I want to be the best
all the time.

918
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:57,090
You know?
Even in the gym,

919
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:59,190
no matter what,
I'm like I'm pushing like I want to

920
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,840
train harder than you.
I want to be better than you.

921
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,670
And so that's something that we need
doing.

922
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:04,950
If I had to work with and I've always
had to work on it,

923
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:06,510
you know,
I just kinda got to,

924
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:07,230
you know,
stay,

925
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,670
stay,
control the fire.

926
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,140
How do you control yourself when it
comes to like the amount of work you do?

927
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:15,660
Do you monitor your heart rate?
Do you check?

928
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:18,660
Like do you have any sort of markers
that you checked to make sure that

929
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:20,820
you're not overtrained?
I know a lot of guys do it off their

930
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:22,080
heart rate.
It's a good way to do it.

931
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,850
Am I just kind of off the field for the
most?

932
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,620
So how am I waking up in the morning and
how am I feeling?

933
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:27,720
Am I eager to go train?
Am I eager?

934
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,250
Just still feeling like I'm the best in
the world?

935
00:36:29,251 --> 00:36:32,760
That's kind of like my body lets me know
mentally of what I should be doing,

936
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:34,410
what I should.
And it's taken a while to learn that I

937
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:36,480
wish I would've known this during
wrestling cause I,

938
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,250
I,
I believe I messed up my wrestling

939
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:41,670
career in college by just pushing too
hard for too long and red lining my

940
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:42,030
body.

941
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,160
So it's all just all feel now and I kind
of lay out my,

942
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,560
my whole camp that way,
you know,

943
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:48,420
I know what days I'm going to do three
practices,

944
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:51,300
what day I'm going to do one and just
kind of go off a feel,

945
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:52,710
you know,
if I need to rest the whole weekend or

946
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,560
just rest Sunday,
it's all if just my energy levels and

947
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:57,300
how much I'm willing to do.
Do you,

948
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,370
do you have a nutritionist or,
I do.

949
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,400
I'm perfecting athletes.
I'm actually teaming up with them now

950
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,050
tune.
We're doing programs for little kids and

951
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:06,120
for wrestlers as well.
Cause the wrestling,

952
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,830
the wrestling world does not know
enough.

953
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:10,110
I mean they've cut weight for the
longest amount of time,

954
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,990
but they just do it the wrong ways.
But yeah,

955
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,230
perfecting athletes has helped me out a
lot with my career and they actually

956
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:18,420
have been able to boost my hormones with
the way I eat.

957
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,860
You know?
And that's how so,

958
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,350
um,
so my,

959
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:25,110
my a nutritionist Michelle,
she used to be a fertility doctor and

960
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:27,450
she's real holistic.
She's into acupuncture and doing all

961
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:28,760
that.
And the,

962
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:29,594
the,
the,

963
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,760
the foods that they're feeding you are
the right things for your endocrine

964
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:35,370
system and boosting your testosterone
and making you just a healthier human

965
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:36,150
being.
I mean,

966
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,370
if you eat and live healthier,
your body is going to produce more

967
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:41,790
testosterone and live the right way.
And that's what they'd done with me.

968
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,770
And what I've heard is that more fats
like eating more fats,

969
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,030
good fats.
And I've seen it in a lot of different

970
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:49,850
athletes,
especially athletes it fall,

971
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:54,420
start falling ketogenic diets that ramps
up their hormone production because fats

972
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:57,600
are a precursor for hormones,
so a lot of coconut oil,

973
00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:01,740
a lot of Avocados,
saturated fats from healthy meats,

974
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,390
especially like grass fed meat.

975
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,340
I feel like you can't get enough of it.
I mean,

976
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:08,010
if you're working out as much as I am
during camp or even just working all the

977
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,150
time,
like you can't get more,

978
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,550
the good fats are one of the best things
for you.

979
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,020
Yeah.
That's the other thing to take into

980
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:16,350
consideration when people talk about
athletes and people talk about people

981
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,960
that exercise and are fit and want to
follow a healthy diet.

982
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,660
There's such a different caloric
requirement.

983
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,440
For someone like you who's training,
what do you train two or three times a

984
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:27,030
day?
Yeah,

985
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:30,480
two or three and just to switch it up,
sometimes I'll do one j one harder line.

986
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,980
Just depends where I'm at.
But yeah,

987
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,060
I'd say on average three times a day,
so your body is just a blast furnace.

988
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,790
It's hard for me to hold on to weight.
You know,

989
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,670
it's,
I had a try,

990
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,620
I got to try as hard as they can to keep
my weight up.

991
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,800
So when I'm out of season,
like right now I'm trying to lift his

992
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,400
lift heavy and stay as big as I can.
And then when I get into camp,

993
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,680
you know,
change it up while I'm doing that.

994
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:52,990
A lot of hypertrophy right now,
let of hypertrophy training,

995
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,480
I'll get closer to campus or doing more
strength training.

996
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,960
And then when I get in camp like closer
to my fight and do more power training.

997
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,960
So when you say hypertrophy,
like what kind of training?

998
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,730
Like what?
Like like dead lifts?

999
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:05,200
Like what kind of stuff?
Yeah,

1000
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,670
I mean I'll obviously I'll do delis and
stuff,

1001
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:08,500
but it just,
it all depends on the reps you're doing

1002
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,940
really and how much weight you're going
to do.

1003
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,190
So if I wanted my approach,
if you have find a weight that's hard

1004
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:13,780
for me to do 10 to 12 times,
you know,

1005
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:17,110
that's what's gonna make my muscles
build them like higher reps and start

1006
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:17,950
building size.

1007
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,860
And then when I want to get strength,
I'm going to start doing less reps,

1008
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,620
you know,
around like six and that's hard to do at

1009
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:25,540
six and then that's when we started
building more strength.

1010
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,040
You know,
power is uh,

1011
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,170
you know,
three quick hard explosive,

1012
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,840
you know,
dead lifts and cleans and stuff like

1013
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:33,680
that.
Breaks in between sets.

1014
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,560
Yeah,
all depends on the brakes as well too.

1015
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:39,400
Yeah.
So when you're getting down to one 45 or

1016
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:41,500
one 35 rather,
how difficult is that for you?

1017
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:45,190
Like what are you walking around at a
during camp and walk around like one 50

1018
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:50,380
I usually show up five days before my
fight at one 52 I usually train what I'm

1019
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:53,440
going to fight at.
So I walk into the cage one 51 53

1020
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:57,220
probably I'm training like that my whole
entire camp five days before the fight

1021
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:59,530
and Wayne one 15 and then I just lose it
all with waterway.

1022
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,660
So that's not that much.
Not at all.

1023
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,320
And it seems like a lot to poke people
listening probably,

1024
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:09,520
but we know guys who are losing 25 30
which I think is too much.

1025
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,780
I think that's not healthy for your
brain.

1026
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:13,180
That's too hard to recover hydration on
your brain.

1027
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:15,280
You know?
Have you ever thought that if you didn't

1028
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,760
do the hypertrophy training and you
didn't do all the power training and you

1029
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:21,730
just did more robotic,
like you might drop down to one 45

1030
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:24,940
naturally and then might be able to cut
to one 25 yeah.

1031
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:27,670
Yeah.
I mean I thought I could make 25 I mean

1032
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,470
it's definitely wouldn't be fun and I
don't really,

1033
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,120
I don't really want to have to,
but yeah,

1034
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,380
it's definitely something that I could
do.

1035
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:33,760
I mean,
you know,

1036
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:36,340
I'm trying,
Heidi mouse needs a supervisor.

1037
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,820
He does man.
And I'm a huge fan of the guy too.

1038
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,920
You know,
he's so good that I would love to fight

1039
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:44,020
him and I,
I do feel I have a really good style for

1040
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:45,010
mighty mouse too.
So,

1041
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,830
cause I know he's talking about doing a
superfight.

1042
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,510
He's,
I mean it's,

1043
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:53,020
he's in a interesting position because
he's really essentially cleared out his

1044
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:54,220
weight class.
I mean,

1045
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:57,100
he's fighting Wilson Hayes and Wilson's
a very tough fight.

1046
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,540
Fight the winner of the show that the
benefits of just,

1047
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,950
it's a bit of me just,
just a wrapped up filming a show with

1048
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,720
the,
I think,

1049
00:41:06,721 --> 00:41:08,440
uh,
do meet you supposed to fight the winner

1050
00:41:08,441 --> 00:41:09,850
of the show.
I think you're right.

1051
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,790
But what did I read too?
That way he was supposed to fight,

1052
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:17,230
but he got hurt and pulled out of the
fight and now I think he's supposed to

1053
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:18,220
fight the winter.
The ultimate fighting,

1054
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,581
sir.
No,

1055
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:20,380
I think you're right.
But I read something today.

1056
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:22,570
I forgot about that,
but I read something today about him

1057
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:24,760
fighting Wilson.
So maybe it was just a,

1058
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,670
an older article or something like that,
or maybe it was confused,

1059
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,930
but my point is,
even if you fight is the winner of the

1060
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:33,500
show.
It good luck to those guys.

1061
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,070
Yeah,
good

1062
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,870
luck.
You're fighting a fucking human buzzsaw

1063
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,561
yeah,
yeah.

1064
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,740
He's on another level again,
cardio punching from all angles.

1065
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:40,760
Yeah.
He's good man.

1066
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,050
And he's,
in my opinion,

1067
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:46,370
one of the best examples or the best
example ever of a guy who has so many

1068
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,380
possibilities.
His language,

1069
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,010
the language of fighting his language
has the richest vocabulary of any

1070
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:55,100
fighter.
I mean the way he fucked so hutto up in

1071
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:58,490
a clinch with those knees to the body
like that is it.

1072
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,730
Who does it better than that?
I've never seen a guy did good break a

1073
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:03,470
guy down better with needs to the body
like that.

1074
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,840
You'd have to go to Anderson versus rich
Franklin.

1075
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,770
Oh Nice.
Good call.

1076
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,730
But that was like almost like a more
brutality oriented thing.

1077
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,960
I mean when Anderson did it was just
grab a hold of you and just rag doll you

1078
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,320
with with when he was doing it,
when mighty mouse is doing,

1079
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:20,840
it was almost like,
like it was crazy to watch.

1080
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,630
It's like Jesus Christ,
like these things are coming there.

1081
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:25,310
They're landing like that.
The vibe,

1082
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,730
he's firing them off like with no
hesitation.

1083
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,340
There's no wind up,
there's no exertion.

1084
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,710
Everything seems effortless and they're
there.

1085
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,910
It looks like he could do it all day and
it looks like a real fucking problem

1086
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:38,744
when you're in there with them.

1087
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,621
Well,
what are the,

1088
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:43,370
I think I'm assuming make sense is Matt
Hume,

1089
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,590
his being his coach who's obviously the
wizard,

1090
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:47,810
right?
Very intelligent in the fight world,

1091
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:50,480
but with the background of pseudo
missing weight,

1092
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:53,960
so much attacking the body,
assuming that maybe he had a hard cut

1093
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,810
and maybe ate too much to drink too much
and attacking the body as far as the

1094
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:58,340
game plan.
So it was very smart of him.

1095
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,200
Then also,
obviously he did it with the correct

1096
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:01,930
timing and accuracy.
So yeah,

1097
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:04,620
it was good.
So who to really struggles to get done

1098
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:07,430
in 25 that's what I hear you look big on
the show.

1099
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,313
I filmed a little,
yeah,

1100
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,710
I just did 25 huh?
Yeah,

1101
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,110
I,
I find that,

1102
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,520
yeah,
he may be,

1103
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,960
I mean maybe like the exact example
we're talking about with Tj like that

1104
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,590
maybe they were like very similar in
size.

1105
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,150
Just decided to go down there and AH,
good call.

1106
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,470
Yeah.
It just doesn't have the correct,

1107
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:25,450
maybe not the correct path to actually
make it happen.

1108
00:43:25,451 --> 00:43:27,160
If he's actually missing weight,
they needed to get,

1109
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,410
I don't know what his deal is.
Lesson a long time.

1110
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,750
He did a few struggles in the past but
to,

1111
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,160
he missed a couple of the UFC weights,
Huh?

1112
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,770
Yup.
Yeah.

1113
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:39,310
And they made him fight at one 35 that's
spotify at one 35 and then the showed

1114
00:43:39,311 --> 00:43:42,580
them that he could make 25 again and did
it and then because he's going to be

1115
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:44,980
fighting that,
but it'd beat us now and I'm not sure

1116
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:46,360
when that fight is,
maybe December,

1117
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,670
but the at me,
this is coming out to Colorado in about

1118
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:50,770
one week.
He just texted me the other day and he

1119
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:53,860
actually bought a condo in Colorado.
Susan be training with us full time

1120
00:43:53,861 --> 00:43:57,550
until the fight and that's nice.
But maybe this is a very creative

1121
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,230
martial artists.
We and him,

1122
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:00,640
when we train,
we flow,

1123
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,490
we create a whole bunch of new rhythms
and paths and patterns.

1124
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:04,150
It's good.
I do.

1125
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,350
I love it as a martial artist finding
the next level of the game.

1126
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,510
It happens a lot with him.
Also at Tj,

1127
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,240
it's fun to work with that level of
athlete just to play with the game

1128
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:14,260
itself.
Overall,

1129
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,610
expanding the level of martial arts.
That's where I'm,

1130
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:19,120
I'm fascinated by what's the next level?
Where are we at?

1131
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:19,954
What can we create?

1132
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,490
Yeah.
Benevidez is also one of those guys that

1133
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:25,250
if you saw him like in a silhouette,
if you couldn't see who he was,

1134
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,440
if you couldn't see any detail but you
saw him move around,

1135
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:28,610
you would know it was him.
Yeah.

1136
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,410
That's good.
The way he holds his hand,

1137
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,100
the way he holds his hands,
like

1138
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,780
everything cause you've got a very
distinct,

1139
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,940
oh,
he's one of my favorite people in the

1140
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:36,720
world,
man.

1141
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,690
I love that dude.
He's such a character man.

1142
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,230
We're really just spinning kicks and
stuff.

1143
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,020
He's got him,
dude.

1144
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,040
What do you got here for notes,
dude?

1145
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,050
What's going on?
It's made just for me to slow down and

1146
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,030
make sure I take my time and uh,
yeah,

1147
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:53,280
that's my main thing.
Let's slow down and think I get so

1148
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:56,560
wrapped up and just getting it.
I put myself into fight mode when I talk

1149
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:59,610
and I just got to make sure I'm being
calm and being collective and making

1150
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:02,490
sure I'm getting the points and the
messages across with with what I'm

1151
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,110
doing.
Because now obviously on the podcast,

1152
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,420
this podcast has helped change my life
over the years.

1153
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:09,690
And I'm sure you get this all the time,
but you'd literally help change people's

1154
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:10,470
lives for the better.

1155
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,720
And I thank you for that and thanks for
having me on.

1156
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,500
And for us it's,
it's,

1157
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:15,760
it's bad ass,
but uh,

1158
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:20,850
to use this type of properly to help
influence others and not to try to tear

1159
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,410
anybody's name down,
but to help uplift and inspiring and

1160
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,190
help people become better human beings.
That's what I felt my messages on this

1161
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:29,310
earth is to help people become better in
my vehicle.

1162
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,710
My tool is martial arts,
so I love it.

1163
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:34,830
Whether general fitness or training,
the highest level Ninjas to compete for

1164
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:36,960
the belt.
It's my service back to the world to

1165
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:38,550
help make sure we're all together.
Well,

1166
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:41,580
it's interesting to see you really
flourish as a coach too,

1167
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:45,840
because very few fighters who I'm here
taken to it the way you have,

1168
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,650
where you're not only will you a very
good fighter and an excellent fighter,

1169
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:52,290
but you've,
you've surpassed that as a coach.

1170
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,750
That's really rare.
I feel that.

1171
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,520
I agree with that.
I appreciate that.

1172
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,980
Um,
I just put my time,

1173
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:01,770
energy and my,
and my ocd ness in to developing others.

1174
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,070
Like that's literally what it is.
I'm obsessed with it and there's only

1175
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:06,780
one way to be great.
It's to be obsessive,

1176
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:07,740
you know,
and then to have,

1177
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,620
you know,
a fellow ninjas like Tj and Benevidez to

1178
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,470
play along with,
with this tool of martial arts to see

1179
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,270
what the next layer is.
I love it.

1180
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,720
You mean I need this level of dedication
and athleticism in order to do that?

1181
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,710
So,
uh,

1182
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,300
because of them,
I'm at the level that I'm at.

1183
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:23,520
So it's a win win.
Like every relationship should be,

1184
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,870
read the notes slow down,
like every relationship should be,

1185
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:29,030
it should be a willing,
not,

1186
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,240
oh,
not a one side of the path.

1187
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:31,290
So,
um,

1188
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,050
you know,
not long ago Tj asks me why I'm always

1189
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:36,140
so hyper and excited and loving life.

1190
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:40,810
It's because his goals are my goals.
Like one of my dreams is to see him with

1191
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:42,870
the belt again.
Like that's something that I obsess.

1192
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:44,400
I was to make sure he's wearing the belt
there.

1193
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,660
It's in its proper place.
So,

1194
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,260
and same thing for benevides.
I would absolutely love to have been a

1195
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,830
vsp wearing the belt.
So,

1196
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,710
um,
for me to help others become better

1197
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,480
brings me a lot of joy in it.
And I loved that.

1198
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:59,430
Isn't it funny that that passion and
that intensity and focus has a negative

1199
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:01,080
connotation?
People call it OCD.

1200
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,530
We're weird with obsessed.
Yeah.

1201
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,860
Yeah.
It works for me.

1202
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,390
But it wouldn't mean,
but why,

1203
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,940
why is that like necessarily negative?
It's not,

1204
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:09,380
yeah.
For,

1205
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:09,870
well,
I,

1206
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,550
for me,
because I have so many things going on,

1207
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:13,530
there's so many other elements
throughout the world with my wife,

1208
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:14,670
my family,
and my business.

1209
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,690
I'm lucky and I'm blessed that
everything in my circle,

1210
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,680
my bubble works with each other.
Well,

1211
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,420
because I mean I take my kids to go and
train,

1212
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,880
my wife goes and trains people asking me
this quite a bit.

1213
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,620
Are you going to have your,
your kids fight?

1214
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,080
No,
I'm not going to have the fight if they

1215
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:29,680
choose to,
I will support their path,

1216
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,960
whatever that is.
Whatever their passion is that it was a

1217
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:35,650
support that where they do have to train
because it look at it as a form of

1218
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:37,420
insurance.
I'm not always going to be around to

1219
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,990
protect them and want to make sure that
they can handle potential confrontations

1220
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,370
if they,
if they can,

1221
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:44,410
if they need to by either talking about
it,

1222
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:46,480
you know,
turn to diffuse a situation or if it

1223
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:48,850
does come to come to a physical
confrontation,

1224
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,320
they can handle themselves properly.

1225
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,400
But just being healthy and happy and
confident with your walking your talk

1226
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:57,180
and be able to help other people.
That's what I make it.

1227
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,050
Sure.
It's mandatory that my kids do train

1228
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:03,900
martial arts and my wife as well,
El Guapo just texted a sensei car.

1229
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,150
Man Carter is definitely going to find
out bossy.

1230
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,761
Yeah,
little boss.

1231
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:07,480
So my,
uh,

1232
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,750
so I have my daughter Jade,
my little boy Duane Ludwig and then my

1233
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,080
third child is Carter boss led but we
all refer to him as possible.

1234
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,700
I'm a little boss,
he's the man.

1235
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,710
So since uh,
since everyone's my main,

1236
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:21,310
uh,
my most influential martial artist to

1237
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:25,240
make an impact on me and uh,
he's changed my life with what he's done

1238
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:29,050
for me is carrying his passion in my
martial arts journey and then he's the

1239
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:32,350
first guy to take combinations and put
them into one coat.

1240
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,710
Great boss.
Ruben is here.

1241
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,580
Bas rutten,
ladies,

1242
00:48:42,581 --> 00:48:44,790
gentlemen,
former UFC heavyweight champion and of

1243
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:49,791
the baddest man that ever lived.
Thank you for coming.

1244
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:52,760
Have a seat time.
No seizures.

1245
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,570
I know Carter is going to fight just
cause how aggressive he is.

1246
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:58,150
I remember like the first time ever go
into Dwayne's house and watching his

1247
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:00,760
little two year old,
two year old pride stomp his dog.

1248
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,900
He knows what a pride stop,
isn't it?

1249
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,170
Price doubling the dog.
We have big,

1250
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:09,130
big huge pit bulls.
One of them was so a move but two year

1251
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:13,240
old kid stomping a pit bull.
That's what people have a misconception.

1252
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,700
Pimples being bad dogs,
but they are known in the past as nanny

1253
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:18,820
dogs.
My kids can actually physically rough up

1254
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:21,430
my pit bulls and they don't care.
They're big enough.

1255
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:23,470
They're strong if they're composed of
and they're females.

1256
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,380
So they just,
they're just about it.

1257
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,880
The female that does definitely helps
for sure.

1258
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,920
Yeah.
Don't tell them this story,

1259
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:31,050
uh,
that uh,

1260
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,200
you pretty much went naked then I heard
from your wife yesterday separating the

1261
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:37,420
pedals.
So,

1262
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,760
uh,
uh,

1263
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,200
the two dogs did you have two females?
Two females.

1264
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,010
That's all good.
Yeah.

1265
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,650
So the story would prove your point.
Crack.

1266
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,400
Uh,
I'm about to hop in the shower and my

1267
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:50,080
wife tells me the dogs are fighting out
back.

1268
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,890
So I grabbed my towel,
I wrapped around it.

1269
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,030
I run outside to separate the dogs cause
they'll fight cause there's the

1270
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:57,960
neighbor's dog barks and they'll bark at
that and the bark at each other.

1271
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,470
Then they start arguing and fighting.
Right.

1272
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,320
So I anyways,
they went outside with my towel on to

1273
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:05,080
get the dog separate them.
While I'm separate in the dogs,

1274
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:07,870
the towel falls off.
But I still have to separate the dogs

1275
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,300
and the neighbors behind me.
Now it's a show boom.

1276
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:11,770
And they have,
they have to get together

1277
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,120
back naked.
Just rolling with the dog and separating

1278
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:18,650
them and making sure everything is good.
Uh,

1279
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,360
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure what his wife looks at me

1280
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:25,780
now and it's a little bit strange.
[inaudible] she does it.

1281
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,020
She doesn't know.
Uh,

1282
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,010
it's always nice to

1283
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,800
feel wanted.
That's a sad scene.

1284
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:34,490
Separating each are fighting pitfalls.
It's funny now he's flopping around this

1285
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:36,320
shit.
Oh yeah.

1286
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:39,250
That would have been good.
Although it's a joke now is I'll stay at

1287
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,610
the dogs fighting to go rip my shirt
off.

1288
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,130
Now's a good one.
I had two females.

1289
00:50:45,131 --> 00:50:46,730
It fought to the death.
Oh,

1290
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:47,151
that's right.
Yeah.

1291
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:49,380
I heard that mom was a dead dog in my
living room.

1292
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,410
Not Good.
Yeah.

1293
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,910
How was the other dog was healthy or it
had some fucked up.

1294
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,340
She was fucked up.
I put her down after that.

1295
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,670
She killed another dog too.
She was crazy.

1296
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:01,020
And then a rescue dog.
I got her a little too late to my

1297
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,990
rescue.
I got her when she was about nine,

1298
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:06,260
10 months old and two you'd already been
indoctrinated into the world of

1299
00:51:06,261 --> 00:51:07,094
violence.
Oh,

1300
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,900
I see it as much as I travel and move
around.

1301
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,450
I want the pit bulls there cause no
one's in there breaking in my house and

1302
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:14,570
they pit bulls and my wife happened to
the gun and everything so we're good.

1303
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,250
Or if they do it,
they're not going to have a good morning

1304
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:16,731
guys.
Yeah.

1305
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:17,451
Yes sir.
Yeah,

1306
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:20,240
there's and females are like super
protective.

1307
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:21,520
She,
they both the more yep.

1308
00:51:21,521 --> 00:51:22,354
Yeah,
yeah.

1309
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,490
They genuinely love our kids.
Yeah.

1310
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:28,520
But females together like date just
there like chicks together.

1311
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,230
Like try,
try having two wives.

1312
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:33,290
Good luck with that shit.
But to get it to the restroom.

1313
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,130
Right.
That's what they do.

1314
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,620
Go together and stab each other.
Just,

1315
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,230
just something about females.
They just,

1316
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,810
two men can,
they get together and one of them will

1317
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:44,660
decide or two male dogs,
one of them will decide like,

1318
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:46,100
okay,
that guy is the king and I'll just

1319
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:50,390
fucking cower when he growls at me.
But females dade fucking,

1320
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:53,360
they never decide who the outfits,
they just go,

1321
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:54,920
Nah,
that bitch got lucky last time.

1322
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:57,440
We're going
right now.

1323
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,390
It's women.
It's all the time with women.

1324
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:01,330
If you think about it,
well my wife goes to bank for it.

1325
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,980
She went out with the other women.
They all this always stressed like,

1326
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,220
oh,
so and so has cancer so and so is this

1327
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,640
with us,
with guys that never comes up right here

1328
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,500
about him?
He got no,

1329
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:13,334
we are like Barney.
Yeah.

1330
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,740
So much sorrow.
That is so true.

1331
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:19,600
Women always want to tell you who's
sick,

1332
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,300
who's got a problem.
Oh,

1333
00:52:22,301 --> 00:52:24,250
she's got chronic fatigue syndrome.

1334
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,880
Oh,
they read on the Internet.

1335
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,721
Oh,
I have a headache.

1336
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:27,531
And they read it and you're like,
oh,

1337
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:28,364
this could be cancer,

1338
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,840
right?
Oh yeah,

1339
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,300
all the time.
My wife says it's good.

1340
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,170
My wife,
she's on point with stuff.

1341
00:52:35,171 --> 00:52:37,450
She's good about that.
Good positive stuff and last down and

1342
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:39,640
take care of the family and she,
she's good.

1343
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,940
She's programmed herself wisely.
I feel well they say that there's

1344
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,560
natural sort of evolutionary path that
women get together and talk a lot.

1345
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:51,190
Like that's one of the reasons why
gossip exists so much with women because

1346
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:55,690
women would be gathering food and
talking and that was one of the ways

1347
00:52:55,691 --> 00:52:58,020
they figured out who was full of shit
and who wasn't.

1348
00:52:58,021 --> 00:53:00,460
They had where's the men would be out
hunting and he'd be like,

1349
00:53:00,461 --> 00:53:01,610
shut the fuck up.
Oh,

1350
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,660
interesting.
Interesting.

1351
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,440
Yeah.
That's why men value.

1352
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,090
We'll also why men,
they value quiet men who know when to be

1353
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:11,290
quiet.
It's important.

1354
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:15,430
And also they,
they don't value men who wear shiny shit

1355
00:53:15,431 --> 00:53:19,000
and are really loud and have a lot of
junk on and stuff like that because

1356
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:20,230
those assholes would get in trouble.

1357
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,570
They would fuck up hunting parties.
Interesting.

1358
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,370
I I agree with that.
That's right.

1359
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:26,640
But it makes,
I read it.

1360
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:29,640
Yeah.
Women are programmed to do more things

1361
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:33,200
simultaneously at the same time.
That's why they can really take care of

1362
00:53:33,201 --> 00:53:34,230
the kids.
But he can do anything.

1363
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:37,800
We don't,
we just have one focus and that's it.

1364
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,950
That's why I went to military and women.
I always think it's a dangerous thing.

1365
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,770
And the reason I'm saying in dangerous
thing is because the natural inclination

1366
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:46,740
for a guy is to protect a woman.
You know?

1367
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:50,040
So if something happens,
everybody wants to automatically,

1368
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:53,070
that's an instinct that's built into the
guy to protect a woman,

1369
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:55,830
which could of course make a big trouble
in the integrate.

1370
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,590
Right.
And I said [inaudible] to treating them

1371
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:00,360
as an equal on the battlefield.
That's it.

1372
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:01,260
Yeah.
Protect them.

1373
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,600
Well maybe trading wool or take that
away.

1374
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,610
You know,
if they train like a guy,

1375
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:06,930
then they go,
okay,

1376
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,060
my wife is down.
So see,

1377
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,120
I don't want to break it down.
Show fight.

1378
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,200
She fought me.
Can't

1379
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:21,750
play too rough with the kids.
I go see her looking at me watching over

1380
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:22,500
across the gym.
I'm like,

1381
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,590
Oh shit,
she'll come on,

1382
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:26,660
fuck me up.
And she's,

1383
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:27,810
she's,
she's awesome.

1384
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:28,880
But why was the keeper?
Well,

1385
00:54:28,881 --> 00:54:33,120
it's strange times because we're,
we're asking women to take on a lot of

1386
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:35,490
the traits and characteristics of men,
you know,

1387
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:35,970
it's,
uh,

1388
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,500
and uh,
some of them want to,

1389
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:38,820
and I understand that,
but some,

1390
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:41,640
for some they feel like they're required
to,

1391
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,640
and I don't necessarily know if that's
what they want,

1392
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,511
you know,
I just,

1393
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:48,150
but I think society wants a woman to be
a breadwinner.

1394
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,750
They want women to contribute and
compete with men in the workplace.

1395
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,570
And a lot of ways in a lot of women want
to do that tail.

1396
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,300
Lydia?
Yeah.

1397
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,360
And then you like,
when you see that and then when it comes

1398
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:59,880
to the military,
it's very difficult to say like,

1399
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:01,170
oh,
women shouldn't be on the battlefield

1400
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:02,430
because then all of a sudden you say,
well,

1401
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:03,770
what are you sexist?
You know,

1402
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:06,990
but,
but it's not traditionally a female open

1403
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:07,824
option.
Yeah.

1404
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,650
If you,
if that's a path you want to go ahead

1405
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:10,790
and go ahead.
I want to be made.

1406
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:11,910
You'd be,
you will have fun.

1407
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:13,470
Yeah,
I get that.

1408
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,840
I mean,
there's some women that I think would

1409
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:16,350
probably gravitate towards killing
people.

1410
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:17,760
They'd probably think it would be a lot
of fun.

1411
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,130
Well,
if you're a feminist then also when you

1412
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:22,410
see a spider,
don't let us get rid of the spider.

1413
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,640
They all want to play power.

1414
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,370
Power that there's some of them,
you know?

1415
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:25,870
No,
no,

1416
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:29,220
I do everything myself.
I said,

1417
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:32,220
well that's your job right now as well.
Yeah,

1418
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,350
I guess so.
Why was the reason,

1419
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:38,070
something about Arachnophobia where they
were thinking that Arachnophobia which

1420
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:41,850
is a fear of spiders and a bunch of
different like snake phobias and much

1421
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:45,610
different phobias might literally be the
memory of your ancestors.

1422
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:49,380
Like someone you know in like someone
your ancestors know,

1423
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:53,370
died in front of them,
got bit by a spider or they almost died

1424
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,000
and they got bit by a spider and that
shit is just hardwired into your DNA

1425
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,300
that says some people see a fucking
spider and they can't move.

1426
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:02,310
They freak out.
It doesn't make any sense.

1427
00:56:02,311 --> 00:56:04,110
My daughter freaks out when a wasp comes
by.

1428
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,100
She'll just freeze.
I'm like,

1429
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:06,940
Holy Shit,
I got to go pick her up or swap the for

1430
00:56:06,941 --> 00:56:09,840
the wasp away.
We have lost in our area so that Kinda

1431
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,040
makes,
she just freezes out,

1432
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,860
fly around.
You don't know where they're going or

1433
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:15,180
what.
My daughter's got good foot work.

1434
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:16,520
Did you ever hear him say that?
She does.

1435
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:20,690
That makes a lot of noise.
Like meditating,

1436
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:24,280
flying in front of Michael.
When you meditate

1437
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,840
they come and fuck with you.
I look,

1438
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,900
I opened my ass.
This guy came back twice.

1439
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,530
What's up and he's right in front of me.
Here he goes.

1440
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:37,640
Maybe sends to your ci for sure.
Three Mil.

1441
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,280
Is that Sensei?
Sorry,

1442
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,180
is meditating in the yard?

1443
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,880
We're just talking about [inaudible]
before you arrived.

1444
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:50,650
As far as um,
I went to go back to this,

1445
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:53,110
but again,
he's the first one that I was aware of

1446
00:56:53,111 --> 00:56:55,360
that actually did elevation training
when they came to Colorado.

1447
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:58,450
So I already said that.
But also with what he did is he took

1448
00:56:58,451 --> 00:57:00,340
combinations and then chunk them
together.

1449
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,490
Hence numbers like four.
If you say four in the root and system

1450
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:04,091
is Jab,
cross,

1451
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:04,720
Hook,
cross.

1452
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,760
So again,
it's that same idea of taking the

1453
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:09,340
combination and checking it together.
Because if I would say jab,

1454
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:09,641
cross,
Hook,

1455
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:11,890
cross,
that's a lot more time than me just sing

1456
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,920
for.
And that concept is what it took to

1457
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:17,660
continue the,
to develop the system and just the idea

1458
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:21,580
would be able to communicate with tj on
the paths are in the cage with limited

1459
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,020
time,
just calling simple commands or

1460
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:25,120
combinations so we can actually make
sure that the fight,

1461
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:26,860
so taking place,
not getting too sidetracked,

1462
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:31,360
he knows he's got a really interesting
system is a Mark Henry Mark Henry Trains

1463
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:34,170
Edson Barboza and Frankie Edgar.
He is a fantastic trainer.

1464
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,250
Like one of the most underrated guys in
the business.

1465
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:40,330
He,
Rashad Evans told me that he will name

1466
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,210
combinations after his daughter like
Rashad.

1467
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,390
I saw that like certain things and they
changes them with every camp,

1468
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,580
with every camp that change,
the names change.

1469
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:51,800
So no one's ever gonna be able to
pattern you then never the other corners

1470
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,860
not going to have any fucking idea what
he's calling out

1471
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,090
Tyson.
He used to change the numbers all the

1472
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:01,490
time because they would have a number
system,

1473
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:03,320
but then every time he would change the
number.

1474
00:58:03,321 --> 00:58:07,010
So nobody could pick up
too much shit.

1475
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,860
If you change,
you're going to chase you up or always

1476
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:10,520
having,

1477
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,880
oh he's be so lost.
Yeah,

1478
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,760
always adding.
He's got a system.

1479
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:17,190
We do an online system.
We do his own academy,

1480
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,170
which he teaches,
you know the basic stuff.

1481
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:20,610
I mean boss,
we've got a boss Combo.

1482
00:58:20,611 --> 00:58:21,750
We do,
you know,

1483
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:23,160
we got my combo,
stuff like that.

1484
00:58:23,161 --> 00:58:25,590
We'll put it online and,
but then we always switch it up.

1485
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,720
So each camp,
my combo might be different,

1486
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,610
you know,
but if he completely switched all of it

1487
00:58:29,611 --> 00:58:30,660
up,
I'd be law.

1488
00:58:30,661 --> 00:58:32,400
We already do too much as it is.
I'd be lost.

1489
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,220
Yeah,
we did the boss come today.

1490
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:38,430
What I'm trying to like when you're
trying to remember all these different

1491
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,200
things and put them all like the Ramon
dekkers,

1492
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:41,520
there's like 50 shot.

1493
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:45,480
Yeah,

1494
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:49,120
the decors like stuff like that.
The Tyson and the deckers.

1495
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:51,550
Those things kind of tie together that
you're doing things you're supposed to

1496
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:53,050
do naturally anyways.
Like you know,

1497
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:56,260
you're returning with the same punch in
slipping and then rolling into the body

1498
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:57,610
and kicking inside than kicking the
head.

1499
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,680
Those are supposed to come together no
matter what.

1500
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,170
He's just making it a combo.
So once you stop,

1501
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:05,150
stop thinking about the common way,
you just naturally start to do it and

1502
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,080
putting in reps with the Tyson,
he's fallen the hooks up with coming to

1503
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:11,470
the body and then the upper cut.
So it's kind of stuff that ties together

1504
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,720
and it's a lot easier to remember.
It has to flow,

1505
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:16,150
has to flow natural intuition boss
before you got here,

1506
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:18,190
we were talking about the level of mma
right now.

1507
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,310
So fascinating because there's so much
depth and people are getting so much

1508
00:59:22,311 --> 00:59:26,450
better and there's so many different
styles and it just seems like such an

1509
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:28,280
exciting time right now for MMA.

1510
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,430
It is.
It is really exciting for me.

1511
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,760
The first big change that happened in
mma was that everybody knows in shape.

1512
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,670
Finally,
you remember we had to all these guys

1513
00:59:36,671 --> 00:59:37,610
running out of gas.
I got it,

1514
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:40,020
dude.
That's like being a painter and half a

1515
00:59:40,021 --> 00:59:42,720
can of paint to a job or run out of
paint.

1516
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,730
I'm sorry.
It's the dumbest thing.

1517
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,680
Go run a hill.
One guy one time told me,

1518
00:59:47,681 --> 00:59:48,640
I said,
yeah,

1519
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:50,980
but a heavyweight there shut gave
Valasquez and he goes,

1520
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,750
yeah,
but he trains really hard

1521
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:53,663
also.
He's Mexican.

1522
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,340
I looked at him like,
are you kidding?

1523
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,010
You're just giving the answer.
Just train really hard.

1524
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,560
And there's a science behind it now to
you know how to train when the train

1525
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:08,010
that hard and which ways to do it.
How do you know how to make your body

1526
01:00:08,011 --> 01:00:10,950
bigger if you need to or faster if you
need more endurance that train that way.

1527
01:00:10,951 --> 01:00:14,690
So I mean it's just like all these other
sports there is coming up real sport.

1528
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,470
You know what to back up my Mexican
theory,

1529
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,560
uh,
I talked to crazy Bob Cook and crazy Bob

1530
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,900
Cook's said came,
we'll take like a month off or two

1531
01:00:21,901 --> 01:00:22,890
months off,
get hurt.

1532
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,600
You know,
something like that has to rest up and

1533
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:25,381
injury,
not trained,

1534
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:28,010
come back and now work everybody.
Not Fair man.

1535
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:31,500
That is not how we were talking about
Gilbert Melendez.

1536
01:00:31,501 --> 01:00:32,730
Another one.
Fantastic cardio.

1537
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:35,250
A lot of Mexicans have crazy fucking
cardio man.

1538
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:39,780
I always had good cardio.
Just might just be a little hard to,

1539
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,880
he has a good cardio cause he doesn't
calm down.

1540
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,270
If he shows up here early for the
podcast,

1541
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,120
he's out in the parking lot.
Shadow boxing,

1542
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:47,963
you know what I mean?
He's not,

1543
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,130
he's going to stay sharp.
Scare the neighbors.

1544
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,360
That belt back that got us in his phone
hanging out like little wayne for

1545
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:57,360
whatever he's got to do to happen.
He's always doing something.

1546
01:00:57,361 --> 01:00:58,200
Always crazy.

1547
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,710
But it goes to up.
But the thing with Duane is when you

1548
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:02,450
hold focus,
which a typist for Dwayne,

1549
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,800
you cannot say,
oh you cannot take a break for five

1550
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:08,870
seconds and say listen,
it makes sure that you do it.

1551
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,713
He goes,
hey,

1552
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,690
he wants to keep,
keep going,

1553
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:13,140
keep going.
Hard to hold time.

1554
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,860
I said guys,
step back dude,

1555
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:16,040
this different now.
Okay,

1556
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:20,240
just relax constantly is in my face.
You know he wants to go 100% all the

1557
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:20,380
time.

1558
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,700
Hi.
He does that to me.

1559
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:26,680
Holding me like I'll be hitting mitts
will be going for like an hour,

1560
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,131
hour and a half.
I'm just like,

1561
01:01:27,131 --> 01:01:27,970
you know,
dead tired.

1562
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:31,890
So my faints and my fork have gotten so
good cause how much he's in my face.

1563
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:36,070
He'll come at me at nonstop wanting me
to throw combos and I am so dead tired,

1564
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:37,510
I'll faint and move.
You know what I mean?

1565
01:01:37,511 --> 01:01:39,680
Like give me some time,
let me read,

1566
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,690
let me read,
you know,

1567
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,620
good cause of uh,
developing your skillset and martial

1568
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:46,560
arts as a whole.
So it's a purpose to it.

1569
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,630
We're talking about how interesting it's
been,

1570
01:01:49,631 --> 01:01:52,900
how Dwayne has transitioned so well and
to becoming a trainer,

1571
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,820
you know?
Was that a challenge for you going from

1572
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:57,340
being a great fighter to being a great
trainer?

1573
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,840
No,
no,

1574
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:02,500
it wasn't for me.
It's always been like I'm riding

1575
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:03,400
shotgun,
you know,

1576
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:05,310
each show or for Fritz what it meant to
be.

1577
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,240
If we're talking about if a,
if a student fights,

1578
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,230
I'm more nervous than the student at
that Modena would be when I would fight

1579
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:14,440
for myself because then I'm in control.
So no,

1580
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,950
but sometimes it's difficult if you
don't have the right student.

1581
01:02:17,951 --> 01:02:18,510
Right.
If you,

1582
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,280
your student's not responding

1583
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,330
and they call.
Yeah,

1584
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,220
it's very hard.
It's a watch,

1585
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:24,350
you have dose,
you know it's,

1586
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,380
but a lot of them don't.
A lot of these fighters don't listen to

1587
01:02:28,381 --> 01:02:31,020
their corners still til this day top
fighters.

1588
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,820
I mean you hit a corner constantly
screaming.

1589
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,250
They don't do what they're doing.
They think they can see it better,

1590
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,410
you know.
But once there was a trust,

1591
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:38,750
you know,
and and,

1592
01:02:38,751 --> 01:02:41,820
and there was always a good trust
between Dwayne and myself and the same

1593
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:45,060
with him and Tj then he knows what
you're seeing.

1594
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,040
That's probably going to work,
you know,

1595
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:48,330
and that,
and he will do it.

1596
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,520
Like if I would say four to Dwayne in a
fight,

1597
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,830
it will come out less than a second
later.

1598
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,250
I really just shout for Papa,
Papa Echo mouth right away if you,

1599
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,670
if you could enhance my voice when he's
fighting.

1600
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,080
It's a video game.
He does.

1601
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:03,590
We need to get a bull horn listening,
get a bull horn.

1602
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:07,240
The UFC shallot bullhorn.
I did that and UFC,

1603
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,320
I brought a mega phone because nobody
was screaming and they actually put it

1604
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:17,010
into contract after that that you could
watch my fight against go suck here.

1605
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,960
Short combinations
because I figured in Japan they're quiet

1606
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,490
right here.
Everybody's going to scream.

1607
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:24,660
I'm not going to hear them.
So uh,

1608
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,750
avi,
Avi Rubin's the old owner of the Beverly

1609
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,040
Hills Jujitsu Club says,
I'm going to bring a megaphone.

1610
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:29,820
They go,
yeah,

1611
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,860
that's a good idea.
That is a great,

1612
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,920
what about just like a tube,
like a roll of toilet paper or something

1613
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:36,030
like that?
Up a piece of paper.

1614
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,320
Yeah.
Could that work?

1615
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,410
I'll try it.
One of those guards,

1616
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:45,411
cones I always go to when I seen him,
the reason why I brought that up about a

1617
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:49,290
training fighters is because there's a,
there's an interesting parallel between

1618
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,450
you two guys,
both great fighters and then both wind

1619
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:52,800
up having great students.

1620
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,790
You having Dwayne as a student and
Dwayne now having t j's is getting in a

1621
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,181
bunch of,
yeah,

1622
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:58,700
I mean there's,
there's a lot to that.

1623
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:00,390
There is,
you know,

1624
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:02,130
but,
but it's all connection and that's what

1625
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:03,150
everything in life,
you know,

1626
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:05,250
once there is a connection that is,
if people,

1627
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,101
you know,
if,

1628
01:04:06,101 --> 01:04:08,140
if I don't care for him,
you know,

1629
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,960
as he's not a good guy,
you know,

1630
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:12,570
and that's what some fighters also,
they come in to just work out,

1631
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:13,830
they're gone again,
you know,

1632
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:16,890
they don't build a relationship.
And once that happens it will,

1633
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:18,000
it hurts.
They're fighting,

1634
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:19,260
I guarantee you that.
Yeah,

1635
01:04:19,261 --> 01:04:21,840
I'm sure.
And for fighters it's really a problem

1636
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:24,360
when you build a relationship with the
wrong trainer and then you've got to

1637
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,450
leave that guy and you know,
you have this tight bond with someone

1638
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:28,770
who doesn't really know enough.

1639
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,240
That's a hard one.
That's,

1640
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,930
I've seen that many times.
And when they leave,

1641
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:35,760
people get super butthurt.
It gets,

1642
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,970
it gets to be a real problem.
But for,

1643
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,150
for the,
if it's real,

1644
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,190
it's real.
And it's always say,

1645
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:42,510
you know what I said to my daughters,
he said,

1646
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,490
what do I tell the guy said,
just tell the truth.

1647
01:04:44,491 --> 01:04:45,530
You know,
can't go wrong with it.

1648
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:46,364
Truth.
It's the guys.

1649
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:47,190
Sorry.
You know,

1650
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,280
it says like on inside of him and me,
I would say about a certified all he

1651
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:52,510
that kicks that sucked or this sucked.
And they say,

1652
01:04:52,511 --> 01:04:53,580
yeah,
but what if you're going to get him on

1653
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:54,081
the show?
I should,

1654
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:57,240
I'll say the same thing.
And if he tells me that I'm wrong,

1655
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,960
he can't say because it did suck.
You know,

1656
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,520
you've got to just got to be honest.
There's nothing he can do.

1657
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,470
Yeah.
It doesn't mean they suck as a human

1658
01:05:04,471 --> 01:05:07,260
being.
Not just means that in that moment that

1659
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:10,680
was the wrong thing to do or they didn't
execute it properly or,

1660
01:05:10,681 --> 01:05:11,290
you know.
Yeah.

1661
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:13,560
And then I have to be on point too,
as far as the trainer with the,

1662
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:16,050
with the fighters and coaching,
if I gotta make sure I'm calling the

1663
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:18,040
right commands at right time as well.
And that

1664
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,070
goes back to the relationship that you
have and making sure you have that

1665
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:21,570
connection

1666
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:23,500
when you also have to know your fighters
capability.

1667
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:26,560
Exactly.
When you have a great race horse,

1668
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,370
you know,
it'd be,

1669
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:30,340
everything becomes so much more
interesting because you have all these

1670
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:31,000
options

1671
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,020
[inaudible] you're going to have so much
mental behind it too.

1672
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:36,450
Like Twain knows how to coach me to,
you know,

1673
01:05:36,451 --> 01:05:39,840
like not everyone responds to negative
energy.

1674
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:42,150
Not some people will respond to negative
energy,

1675
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:43,200
right.
Like Danny Castillo,

1676
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:45,450
you got to tell Danny could steal,
like you're doing that like an idiot

1677
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:47,400
come on.
Different things that you know,

1678
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,031
and he's like,
okay,

1679
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,800
yeah,
he'll do a better with me and Dwayne.

1680
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:51,050
Someone where you know,
you know,

1681
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,370
I've got to pump the guy up maybe a
little bit,

1682
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,300
tell him what he's doing right instead
of what he's doing wrong.

1683
01:05:54,301 --> 01:05:56,100
You know,
so you gotta know how to coach each

1684
01:05:56,101 --> 01:05:58,170
fighter and once you build that
relationship,

1685
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:00,270
like bosses talking about and you don't
let it go.

1686
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,460
Yes sir.
There's very few things that are as

1687
01:06:02,461 --> 01:06:04,190
painful as listening to bad corner work.

1688
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:04,801
Yeah.
Oh,

1689
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:05,461
that's fun.
Oh,

1690
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,340
you gotta hear it went down to his live
around the corner,

1691
01:06:08,341 --> 01:06:10,380
cross blue cross.
I go,

1692
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,500
he just went.
You don't want him to throw a right hand

1693
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:14,520
right now,
you know,

1694
01:06:14,521 --> 01:06:17,910
let him keep that here so the liver is
protected and I go,

1695
01:06:17,911 --> 01:06:18,990
yeah,
that's an idiot.

1696
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,240
Exactly.
Who does that?

1697
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,710
Right.
Did you watch the fights this weekend?

1698
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,753
Yeah,
I did.

1699
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,930
What did you think about steep an hour,
man,

1700
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,490
that was crazy.
Crazy,

1701
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,630
crazy.
De Three or four large punches you gave

1702
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:35,130
Darwin there on an inch there.
All exact at the same spot.

1703
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:37,270
It's got really good position.
Yeah,

1704
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:40,290
just stopped him and he got hit heart.
He waved it off,

1705
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:41,880
but that's the Tina.
We know.

1706
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:44,460
11 guillotines.
I believe that he had to be dry and

1707
01:06:44,461 --> 01:06:46,430
tight once he pulled me in a one time I
said,

1708
01:06:46,431 --> 01:06:47,100
I want to feel it.

1709
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:47,611
I go,
Whoa,

1710
01:06:47,611 --> 01:06:49,890
this is a really tight guilty,
but he got out.

1711
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,320
He's in the,
he's a freak athlete.

1712
01:06:52,321 --> 01:06:54,510
He really is and he's a very likable
guy.

1713
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,460
He's awesome.
He has deep is a good guy.

1714
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:58,290
When we were talking about his
composure.

1715
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,091
Yes sir.
Yes.

1716
01:06:59,091 --> 01:07:01,680
So composed like in Brazil when he
fought for Breeshia,

1717
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:04,830
when he's wanting to stare down,
he's just dead faced.

1718
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:08,070
He's got his own dead face.
It's not like a fade or dead face or

1719
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:10,530
cane dead face.
He's got his own dead phase.

1720
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,470
But those guys that can just stay
completely calm,

1721
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,380
you know,
in that incredible environment of being

1722
01:07:16,381 --> 01:07:20,220
there in Brazil,
45,000 plus people screaming for

1723
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,510
Fabrizie over doom when he just shuts
his lights out

1724
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,130
with our own or main battle.
Right.

1725
01:07:25,131 --> 01:07:28,040
It's being able to,
to control ourselves and he's looks to

1726
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:31,760
have mastered that ability to control
his own emotions and make sure he's

1727
01:07:31,761 --> 01:07:34,130
directing the energy and the right path.
So Steve Bay,

1728
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:35,180
good job.
Grasshopper,

1729
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:40,560
that motherfucker to see if someone got
into his head the way like you and

1730
01:07:40,561 --> 01:07:43,890
dominic were going after each other or
the way connor got into all those head.

1731
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,500
Right.
I guess that was a masterclass in

1732
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:48,870
fucking with someone's head.
Absolutely.

1733
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:54,070
Connor took Aldo completely out of his
element or he was just so frazzled by

1734
01:07:54,091 --> 01:07:56,310
the time they actually met each other
inside the octagon.

1735
01:07:56,311 --> 01:07:58,680
It was just,
I think we had the overeem and a steep,

1736
01:07:58,681 --> 01:08:00,980
it is just same as home and,
and a Raji,

1737
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,150
you know?
Rousey's intimidating.

1738
01:08:03,151 --> 01:08:03,870
Everybody,
Eh,

1739
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,400
the way she is.
And she,

1740
01:08:05,401 --> 01:08:08,730
when she started at the stare down,
that's when she lost it because she

1741
01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:11,450
realized holly didn't care at all.
Right?

1742
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,500
She was just there.
I'm going to hurt you.

1743
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:16,250
That was at as the same as everybody's
intimidated by

1744
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:17,960
overeem.
And you should be because he's a

1745
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:20,360
monster.
But I think open could see in his face

1746
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:21,660
already,
he's,

1747
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,170
he's not intimidated.
This guy has absolutely no,

1748
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:27,650
and then when you fight a guy like that,
that that little voice starts playing in

1749
01:08:27,651 --> 01:08:29,720
your,
in your mind when it gets bad,

1750
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,850
you know?
And that's why maybe we saw these crazy

1751
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:33,500
things of running away,
you know,

1752
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:35,450
which I,
I say it's a good thing because I said

1753
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:37,220
the same thing against conor Mcgregor,
but you know,

1754
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:38,820
for a big,
huge heavyweight,

1755
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,490
it doesn't look good.
You know,

1756
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,340
and now you,
you set yourself up more as a victim

1757
01:08:43,341 --> 01:08:46,670
because he's following you in tech.
And that all is an input in your,

1758
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:49,160
in your own brain.
Because now you start telling yourself,

1759
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,810
oh,
I know everybody thinks I'm a,

1760
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:53,480
I'm hurt or that I'm afraid of.
Am I afraid?

1761
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,880
I'm even know there's the whole doubt
thing that goes on in the mind.

1762
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:59,230
There's always these two voices.
I say the one voice wants to quit that

1763
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,470
the other voice wants to go.
Right.

1764
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,630
You know,
you're a really bad situation.

1765
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:03,321
And they say,
okay,

1766
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:04,280
call it quits.
Gullah cuisine.

1767
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:05,280
And then some of the other ones,
I don't know.

1768
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:05,790
No,
no,

1769
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:06,011
no.
Wait,

1770
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:06,650
wait,
wait.

1771
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:07,270
We're not going to,
no,

1772
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:07,791
no.
Let's just,

1773
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,140
let's just see what happens.
You know,

1774
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,420
and then suddenly you come out of the
situation.

1775
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,090
I was,
I was about to tap in my second fight

1776
01:09:14,091 --> 01:09:14,631
and,
and,

1777
01:09:14,631 --> 01:09:16,190
and,
but then the audience started cheering

1778
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:18,770
for him and then my ego took over.
I go,

1779
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,750
okay.
I get out of the situation and then 30

1780
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:22,340
seconds later and knocked him out to the
need to deliver,

1781
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,263
and I go,
okay,

1782
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:27,890
this is the last time I'm going to think
like that because the bat boy stay away

1783
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:28,730
from the bad voice.

1784
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,680
Yeah.
Focus on what you can control and that

1785
01:09:30,681 --> 01:09:31,281
yourself.
Right.

1786
01:09:31,281 --> 01:09:33,530
Do you ever use any psychological
training?

1787
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:35,900
Did you ever talk to a sports
psychologist or anything like that or is

1788
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:37,460
they're all self taught?
All self taught,

1789
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:41,600
but what I did a lot is talking to
myself and people might laugh about

1790
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:43,970
that,
but I'm very honest to myself.

1791
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,620
Like people say,
oh you nervous to fight?

1792
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:46,760
No,
no,

1793
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:47,540
no.
Why not?

1794
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,490
What can happen?
What can really happen?

1795
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:51,950
He's got to knock me out.
Matt's going to be hard because it never

1796
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:53,900
happened before,
but if it happens while I'm not going to

1797
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:55,760
feel it,
apparently you know you're going to go

1798
01:09:55,761 --> 01:09:57,650
down.
Submission is the submission.

1799
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,800
Is that really so bad?
I'm going to tab so what is so really so

1800
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:01,251
bad?
Well,

1801
01:10:01,251 --> 01:10:04,990
the really bad thing is listening to all
the crap that older,

1802
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:09,380
the not so good fats are going to tell
you afterwards is social media,

1803
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:12,050
but if you just scare you,
remember the last time I told the story

1804
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:15,710
from in the room,
if you take a fighter and and who's

1805
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:16,790
normally a nerve is final.

1806
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:19,340
This is what I tell my students who are
nervous when they have to compete.

1807
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:20,151
I say,
okay,

1808
01:10:20,151 --> 01:10:22,820
imagine now the guys right here.
We put you in the room,

1809
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:25,130
we locked the door.
Nobody can go in there.

1810
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,900
You guys fight.
And when you come out,

1811
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:28,370
you're not allowed to say who want to
lose.

1812
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,530
Did you?
Do you really care if you,

1813
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,030
if you would lose it?
He goes,

1814
01:10:32,031 --> 01:10:33,160
no,
because everybody can lose.

1815
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:33,850
I said,
well,

1816
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,050
that's the mindset you should have when
you go into a fight.

1817
01:10:36,051 --> 01:10:37,790
That's my mindset.
You know,

1818
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,400
winning or losing,
I'm gonna win.

1819
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:40,690
I'm gonna do everything in my power to
it.

1820
01:10:40,691 --> 01:10:41,690
But if I lose,
so what?

1821
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,730
You know,
we're human and we come out of it.

1822
01:10:43,731 --> 01:10:45,890
I say,
you make you overcomplicate things,

1823
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,620
certain combinations.
When I said it's a four and then I,

1824
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:51,980
I do four punches to the head and then I
say I'm going to,

1825
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:53,840
we stayed with this combination.

1826
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,060
The only thing we're going to change
either heights,

1827
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,340
so now I'm going to say for you to the
four points,

1828
01:10:58,341 --> 01:10:59,480
it's a left,
right straight,

1829
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:00,530
left hook,
right straight.

1830
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,671
I'm going to share.
Okay.

1831
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:03,010
Body had had had,
no,

1832
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:04,640
you're the first one has to go to the
body.

1833
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,080
Had had,
had body,

1834
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:07,340
body,
had hat head,

1835
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:08,060
body,
head,

1836
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,460
body had buddy.
I mean now you can make like 12

1837
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:12,860
combinations from just a four punch,
you know?

1838
01:11:12,861 --> 01:11:16,020
And but some people when,
when I tell it to my students sometimes

1839
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,380
they overthink it.
They go to,

1840
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:18,330
oh no,
I said no,

1841
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:20,880
just in body hat do the same
combination.

1842
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,070
But they start thinking,
oh that's the liver shot that no,

1843
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:24,540
that's not liver shot to the body.
Just,

1844
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,740
you know,
keep it simple.

1845
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:28,320
And once you can keep it simple,
it's much easier to,

1846
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:29,800
to do.

1847
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,820
Well,
it's one of the things that we were

1848
01:11:30,821 --> 01:11:32,160
talking about earlier.
It was the,

1849
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:37,180
the amount of fighting that is mental
and the amount that is your attitude and

1850
01:11:38,051 --> 01:11:41,770
how you feel about things and how you go
into things and just your enthusiasm.

1851
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,990
Like Travis Brown,
we were talking about Travis Browne,

1852
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:48,400
who earlier in his career was this
fucking stone cold killer.

1853
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:53,670
I mean he had all his crazy footwork.
He throw a lot of kicks and memory.

1854
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:56,010
We knocked out Stephan's true that
Superman Punch,

1855
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:56,540
right?
Yeah.

1856
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,770
God Damn.
He was so unpredictable and wild.

1857
01:11:58,771 --> 01:12:00,010
I was like,
this motherfucker's can be the

1858
01:12:00,011 --> 01:12:02,090
heavyweight champ.
I just give him out,

1859
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,570
give him some time.
And then he moved to Jackson's is

1860
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:07,570
training and a great camp,
but he just doesn't seem,

1861
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:11,290
I mean maybe as a few losses in a row,
he doesn't seem to have that fire in

1862
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:11,570
him.

1863
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:15,620
Did he lose when he was at objections?
He chased Kemp's,

1864
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,530
yes.
Started losing after you change camps

1865
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,810
most of the time.
But that's what I tell people,

1866
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,550
like my stretch routine and every time
when I say this they,

1867
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,050
they,
they ask me what it's just routine.

1868
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:29,000
I do the same stretch of team as I did
23 years ago when I started.

1869
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:32,240
Same routine.
And the reason is it never got me an

1870
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:34,460
injury.
So if it's a winning combination,

1871
01:12:34,461 --> 01:12:36,110
don't break it.
And it's the same with your team.

1872
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,390
If it's a winning combination,
do not break it.

1873
01:12:38,391 --> 01:12:40,460
Once you bring,
how many fighters do you see changing

1874
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:44,630
camp or firing as a trainer of firing
the manager or somebody who always

1875
01:12:44,631 --> 01:12:47,030
helped him and suddenly they started
losing you.

1876
01:12:47,031 --> 01:12:49,250
You broke the spell or whatever you want
to call it,

1877
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,310
the mystical thing that was going on
that was working.

1878
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,510
Don't break it.
Why would you,

1879
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,680
yeah,
but it's so rare that you find the

1880
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:58,620
perfect person.
Like if you're with Johnny mcfuck stick

1881
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,240
in Columbus,
Ohio,

1882
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:02,750
and he's a shitty coach and you've been
with them forever and you've got this

1883
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,860
weird bond with them.
And then for Rasa,

1884
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:06,090
hobby wants to train you.
You're like,

1885
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,170
God damn.

1886
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:08,430
Yeah,
but what do you do?

1887
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,280
And everybody runs into bus route and
right off the bat,

1888
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,020
sorry,
all my students,

1889
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,010
I say,
listen,

1890
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,550
I teach straight down two times a week.
Go anywhere you want any gym.

1891
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,130
I don't mind guys.
You want a spar without a guide to go

1892
01:13:20,131 --> 01:13:22,780
anywhere you want.
But the problem is if you have that guy

1893
01:13:22,781 --> 01:13:24,510
we were talking about it doesn't know
anything,

1894
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,460
he's going to be butthurt.
He's going to be okay.

1895
01:13:26,461 --> 01:13:27,540
You cannot no go.
You cannot go.

1896
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:31,070
But a good coach will say,
go just straight everywhere.

1897
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,310
If he can find something better.

1898
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,560
Perfect examples.
Duke Roufus,

1899
01:13:34,561 --> 01:13:38,940
who's a great coach and Pedis Pedis
started training at Jackson.

1900
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,130
He just wanted new looks.
You want a different things,

1901
01:13:41,131 --> 01:13:42,870
you want to mix things up,
and he had some great times.

1902
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:44,880
That's,
he also cares about Anthony Pettis.

1903
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,000
He cares about his career.
He wants him to grow,

1904
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:48,901
and so he's like,
yes,

1905
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:52,220
please go do this new stuff.
Every time I went up and trim,

1906
01:13:52,221 --> 01:13:53,580
if Rasa Tristar,
he loved it.

1907
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:54,590
He loved the idea,
go up there,

1908
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:55,620
get some new looks good.
Yeah,

1909
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,330
it's a new technique grow,
you know?

1910
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,760
Those are real friends.
It was a real people that care about you

1911
01:13:59,761 --> 01:14:01,350
and they want you to have the best thing
in your life.

1912
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,800
I said,
Dwight [inaudible] cabs,

1913
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,030
she got show.
Yup.

1914
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:05,923
Yup.

1915
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:11,370
Well there's a small handful,
maybe a half a dozen or more of really

1916
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:12,280
truly

1917
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,960
elite camps right now.
You know,

1918
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:17,080
there's American top team of course is
is a few that you could go over,

1919
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,660
but of places where you're really kind
of can't go wrong,

1920
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:23,880
it's really just a matter of finding the
right combination for you too.

1921
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:24,371
Right?
I mean,

1922
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:26,620
some,
some camps are more grappling heavy and

1923
01:14:26,621 --> 01:14:29,590
you might be back a more of a striker.
We've seen that happen to,

1924
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,030
you know,
the guys just kind of get the wrong

1925
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:33,160
formula.
It's the thing,

1926
01:14:33,161 --> 01:14:36,540
if you're a great striker,
go to a more grappling oriented camp.

1927
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,710
That's what I always say.
You got to striking.

1928
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,690
That's what I decided.
Okay,

1929
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:42,880
this is it.
Forget about striking three times a day

1930
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,010
submissions.
That was it never lost again.

1931
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:49,060
It's just doing what you're not
comfortable at and do that a lot and

1932
01:14:49,061 --> 01:14:50,890
make sure you get comfortable at it.
Then that's it.

1933
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:54,400
Wonderboy is great example of that.
You started training with Weidman who

1934
01:14:54,401 --> 01:14:58,240
was a great wrestler and it just
completely changed his confidence and

1935
01:14:58,241 --> 01:15:00,610
his stand up and now he's so loose
standing up,

1936
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,410
you're getting to see the same
wonderboy.

1937
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,060
That was,
I think it was like 57 and [inaudible]

1938
01:15:05,061 --> 01:15:06,820
was a kickboxer.
Amazing,

1939
01:15:06,821 --> 01:15:09,610
crazy like that.
And you see those skills now because

1940
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,500
good luck taking that guy down.
Correct.

1941
01:15:11,501 --> 01:15:11,951
You know,
he's,

1942
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:13,840
he's getting mauled by Chris Weidman all
time.

1943
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:15,010
Weidman,
who is a big one,

1944
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,630
85 yeah.
You know,

1945
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:20,730
there's so many levels to mixed martial
arts,

1946
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,480
so many areas.
And we could obviously take the,

1947
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:26,290
the three easy ones with the striking,
the wrestling and the grappling,

1948
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:28,360
right?
So with those now,

1949
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,400
what's your style?
What's your skill set?

1950
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,710
And now with that being said,
you've got to make sure you're getting

1951
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:35,440
with the best people in those three
areas or something that we could take in

1952
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:37,120
the fourth account,
which since I said earlier,

1953
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,650
is the conditioning aspect now.

1954
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:41,920
So there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle
and you can't just go to one guy,

1955
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,670
he can't just go to a boxing coach with
the boxing coach isn't really familiar

1956
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:48,490
with mma because things are different as
you point out today with the distances,

1957
01:15:48,491 --> 01:15:49,900
right?
And then using the switches because of

1958
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:52,360
the further distance.
So you've got to make sure you have the

1959
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:54,730
correct people that understand the mixed
martial arts game.

1960
01:15:54,731 --> 01:15:58,210
Because if you go to an expert,
cried the guy who doesn't understand

1961
01:15:58,211 --> 01:15:59,740
where me,
that's not going to work no matter how

1962
01:15:59,741 --> 01:16:01,540
much you guys love each other.
It's not gonna work.

1963
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:04,600
You have to have mma in the mix.
Wrestling coach doesn't know how to

1964
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:05,410
strike.
Yep.

1965
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,540
He's not going to learn how to close the
distances with punches,

1966
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,180
the build time,
time your takedowns,

1967
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,970
he's going to want to grab a hold of you
and move you around to shoot on you.

1968
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:12,760
You know?
So yeah,

1969
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,880
we might also not understand where
you're in vulnerable positions for

1970
01:16:15,881 --> 01:16:18,190
submissions.
Like a lot of wrestlers are still shoot

1971
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:19,750
that double with the neck on the
outside,

1972
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,570
you know?
And I mean they just haven't figured the

1973
01:16:22,571 --> 01:16:25,090
distance out or the difference in the,
in the technique out.

1974
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:25,871
Yup.
Agreed.

1975
01:16:25,871 --> 01:16:27,010
Yeah.
That's why I love this,

1976
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:30,130
this tree on this lineage because I'm
taking what since it has done as much as

1977
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:32,200
I can.
Then what I've done and then adding that

1978
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:35,050
up and I'll pass it and Tj is way,
and this is a direct line of lineage of

1979
01:16:35,051 --> 01:16:38,160
martial arts information that's been
expedited and it's,

1980
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:39,970
it's,
it's awesome to have an actual march

1981
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:42,520
start family and just keep passing on
the knowledge.

1982
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:45,700
It's fun for me as a martial art nerd,
it's also interesting because Tj has

1983
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:49,090
that wrestling background as well.
And then I think that's a big factor in

1984
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:52,810
his success because he's incorporating
all of your techniques and your

1985
01:16:52,811 --> 01:16:56,780
techniques and then on top of that
you've got that elite athleticism and

1986
01:16:56,781 --> 01:16:59,860
then the wrestling base.
So you've got awesome take down defense

1987
01:16:59,861 --> 01:17:02,980
and take downs.
And also I really firmly believe there's

1988
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:07,981
something about wrestlers that fucking
grind of dieting and starving yourself

1989
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:10,070
and yourself and

1990
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,600
the mental toughness that breed that you
know,

1991
01:17:12,601 --> 01:17:15,620
you get from certain wrestlers.
It's like it's off the charts.

1992
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,930
I've still to this day,
never done anything harder than

1993
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:20,000
wrestling.
Even with all the aspects of martial

1994
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:22,910
arts and fighting like fighting to me is
it's just a lot,

1995
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:25,370
lot easier than a grind of a wrestling
season.

1996
01:17:25,371 --> 01:17:27,200
You know,
I rest of the cal state fullerton where

1997
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:28,790
we started way too.
Or Lik I said,

1998
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,820
I overworked myself and push through a
ninth month season.

1999
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,450
Being completely strict on everything.
My Diet,

2000
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:36,380
my,
you know,

2001
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,940
I can't go,
I'm not going out and having fun with my

2002
01:17:37,941 --> 01:17:41,420
friends because I'm wrestling and then
wrestling every weekend and just such a

2003
01:17:41,421 --> 01:17:42,240
hard practice.
Like,

2004
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,950
still today we do two days a week like
restaurant practices.

2005
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,400
Like,
damn,

2006
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,280
I don't want to get ready,
love wrestling.

2007
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,710
I'm gonna have to go really hard.
Like man wrestling,

2008
01:17:51,711 --> 01:17:52,140
I've done it.

2009
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,390
You know,
it's tough man.

2010
01:17:53,391 --> 01:17:55,070
And it definitely does breed mental
toughness.

2011
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,280
And then you're learning how to compete
on your own every weekend.

2012
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,100
When you're training a team elevation,
you doing wrestling practice,

2013
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:04,790
are you doing strictly wrestling?
Are you putting wrestling shoes on and

2014
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:09,791
you're doing like full on wrestling?
You like a competition between your,

2015
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:12,860
your teammates.
Are you doing that of we do that as well

2016
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:14,120
as we'll do it even may wrestling as
well.

2017
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:15,110
You know,
there's different forms of it.

2018
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:16,670
But yeah,
I'll go through my wrestling shoes on

2019
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:18,110
and we're doing matches,
you know,

2020
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,330
it depends on where we're at.
We'll do situations and yeah,

2021
01:18:20,331 --> 01:18:22,160
we're doing full on real wrestling
practices.

2022
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,190
Is there a benefit to having wrestling
shoes on though?

2023
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:28,400
Because you're not going to fight with
them on your defense will become way

2024
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:31,250
better if you wear shoes.
So it's so much easier to get out of a

2025
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:31,910
take down without it.

2026
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:35,010
You can't like a single leg,
you should not get taken down in a

2027
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:37,070
single like anyone may.
If you do your,

2028
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:39,380
I mean it's so easy to slide your leg
out on a single leg,

2029
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,030
but with a wrestling shoe on,
I can't,

2030
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:44,000
I can't just go to that easy defense.
I have to use my hips,

2031
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:46,460
have to cover his head,
I have to use all these positions that

2032
01:18:46,461 --> 01:18:49,430
have a better defense with my shoes on.
So it's a difference between like

2033
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,730
grappling with g Nogi is or that kind of
a thing.

2034
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,710
Yeah,
I mean I,

2035
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,150
so in college I shot high singles,
that's what I shot at shoot a high

2036
01:18:56,151 --> 01:18:59,480
single and got tried to turn and kick
out catches shoe and then take us back

2037
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:01,940
and MMA guy turns and kicks out all the
time.

2038
01:19:01,941 --> 01:19:03,680
So high single eggs not going to work
anymore.

2039
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,290
So yeah,
I mean like with,

2040
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:07,190
with the G on,
you can't get away with certain things.

2041
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:09,580
You can't just slip out of a,
a submission can just slip out of an arm

2042
01:19:09,581 --> 01:19:12,020
bar and roll out of it.
You actually have to have the real

2043
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:15,230
technique of getting out of it.
If this guy is so good at it,

2044
01:19:15,231 --> 01:19:15,961
you know,
so yeah,

2045
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:17,720
it's,
it's learning you to do the defense the

2046
01:19:17,721 --> 01:19:19,220
right way instead of using the cheat
moves.

2047
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:20,630
You know?
That's interesting.

2048
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:21,464
Does it,
um,

2049
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:24,470
was it,
would it be okay if you did it with no

2050
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:27,980
shoes on and your opponent?
I did it with shoes on because that way

2051
01:19:27,981 --> 01:19:32,390
you would have the slipperiness of being
careful wrestling against the kid that I

2052
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:34,400
knew it was coming in from like a
college and he's really good.

2053
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:37,130
I am not wearing shoes.
I don't care.

2054
01:19:37,131 --> 01:19:37,960
I'm not going to wear it.

2055
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,520
She was like Chad Mendez,
like one of the best wrestlers in the

2056
01:19:40,521 --> 01:19:43,160
world at practice.
He'll never ever wear shoes.

2057
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:45,110
Now he doesn't,
his defense is ridiculous.

2058
01:19:45,111 --> 01:19:48,620
He just pushes you off his leg.
Like the way he'll stand now too is

2059
01:19:48,621 --> 01:19:51,140
because he'll only let you shoot a
single day cause he knows how easy it is

2060
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:52,700
to get out of it.
And uh,

2061
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:54,500
he'll,
he'll never ever wear shoes again.

2062
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:57,700
Wrestling ever since grappling though,
don't you think the,

2063
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,790
the,
the injuries,

2064
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:01,730
the twisting niece come from shoes
wearing shoes because a lot of guys,

2065
01:20:01,731 --> 01:20:04,460
they do it on the wrestling mat and
that's still okay because it might slip

2066
01:20:04,461 --> 01:20:06,320
a little bit about as soon as you step
on the judo mat,

2067
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,460
which you're planting

2068
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,950
your feet and then with upper body
motion rotation,

2069
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,070
something's going to twist because a lot
of injuries happened with wrestling,

2070
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:14,370
right?

2071
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:15,330
Yeah.
You've got to get better.

2072
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:17,430
You've got a bit of traction.
So you gotta know.

2073
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:18,540
I mean,
I got to know what you're,

2074
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,630
I mean,
I've wrestled my entire life positioning

2075
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:25,470
with wrestling shoes on and stuff,
but I think it creates better habits to

2076
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:27,210
have your shoes on while wrestling.
You know,

2077
01:20:27,211 --> 01:20:28,700
cause you're not going to be able to get
away with the,

2078
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,200
we call it a stinky lake where you just
whip your leg out.

2079
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:34,290
You know,
if I have a grip and it's what you want

2080
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:36,960
is to grip above your knee.
But as soon as I get your grip below my

2081
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:38,610
knee just by pushing it down,
I'm out.

2082
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,040
I'm just sliding my leg.
It's gotta be a similar situation to

2083
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:41,851
wearing gloves,
right?

2084
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:45,740
Like when trying to limp arm at a
certain positions you have and you kind

2085
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:46,170
of,
it gets,

2086
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:49,770
it's really hard to finish two clubs on
any kind of grappling we do at elevation

2087
01:20:49,771 --> 01:20:51,030
is with our gloves on.
You know,

2088
01:20:51,031 --> 01:20:52,800
cause I'm catching certain moves and
risks.

2089
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,900
I can risk ride differently.
Um,

2090
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:57,060
I could chokes are different.
I can't cite it as easy behind your

2091
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,430
head.
You got to learn all those things with,

2092
01:20:58,431 --> 01:20:59,340
with gloves on as well.

2093
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:03,010
Some people think that it would be a
safer sport without gloves.

2094
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:08,460
Probably
going to be less whole bloody lot more

2095
01:21:08,921 --> 01:21:09,970
blood,
more grown up my bloody,

2096
01:21:09,971 --> 01:21:12,600
that's the thing.
The guts and everything and to breaking

2097
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:13,930
hands.
Yeah.

2098
01:21:13,931 --> 01:21:16,840
But you would learn a lot more effective
striking look,

2099
01:21:16,841 --> 01:21:21,070
you really couldn't just unload on a guy
and just hit anything.

2100
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:23,230
Ross,
I was up training with Tristar.

2101
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:23,861
He's like,
Hey,

2102
01:21:23,861 --> 01:21:27,280
I recommend at least once a day,
once every other day hitting them back

2103
01:21:27,281 --> 01:21:28,300
with no gloves on,
you know,

2104
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:30,250
get that proper technique of no one had
a hit,

2105
01:21:30,251 --> 01:21:31,990
something with no gloves on.
So you don't have that padding and

2106
01:21:31,991 --> 01:21:34,210
protecting.
If I've got a 16 or a 10 ounce glove,

2107
01:21:34,211 --> 01:21:36,790
I'm able to just go away on my bag and
punching as hard as they want it.

2108
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:37,720
I don't have to punch.
Right.

2109
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,450
But if I don't have gloves on and I'm
hitting that as hard as I can,

2110
01:21:40,451 --> 01:21:42,160
I have to hit it correct.
They have to have your right knuckle

2111
01:21:42,161 --> 01:21:43,840
policemen to put it on that bag.

2112
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:47,020
I mean that's what a lot of karate and
traditional martial arts guys believe.

2113
01:21:47,021 --> 01:21:50,140
They believe that those gloves are
actually giving you the soul sort of

2114
01:21:50,141 --> 01:21:52,390
false sense of,
of your abilities,

2115
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,250
you know,
cause your,

2116
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,600
your risks are all wrapped up.
Your hands are all wrapped up.

2117
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:56,463
You know,
you get the question,

2118
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,690
how many times did he break his hands in
a street fight?

2119
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:02,620
All the time.
Mitch blood green because they perfectly

2120
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,060
tape his hands up and training and then
when he had to it has to hit without on

2121
01:22:07,061 --> 01:22:07,871
the other side,
you know,

2122
01:22:07,871 --> 01:22:10,660
hitting a bag and but because if you do
it wrong,

2123
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,850
like if you're hitting a bag,
bare knuckle,

2124
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,960
because I had a guy who told me my,
my coach is really good coach because

2125
01:22:16,961 --> 01:22:19,480
she lets us hit the back until our hands
bleed.

2126
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,130
I say you'll coach is an idiot.

2127
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:24,970
That's what your coaches,
because if this happens for weeks before

2128
01:22:24,971 --> 01:22:26,800
to fly,
I'd guess what's going to happen every

2129
01:22:26,801 --> 01:22:27,581
single word,
God,

2130
01:22:27,581 --> 01:22:29,320
when you hit,
you're going to reopen the cuts.

2131
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,310
It's going to hurt every first.
Oh for your workout,

2132
01:22:33,311 --> 01:22:34,000
right?
Yeah.

2133
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,670
So yeah,
if you do it perfect and the impact of

2134
01:22:36,671 --> 01:22:38,710
spirit,
but as soon as she hit and you slide a

2135
01:22:38,711 --> 01:22:40,320
little bit,
then you shave a knuckle love.

2136
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:43,810
Well four weeks before the fight,
that's not going to heal anymore because

2137
01:22:43,811 --> 01:22:47,110
you have reopen it every time.
One of the interesting things about MMA

2138
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:51,460
is how we're still kind of learning and
there's no right approach for everybody.

2139
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,610
Everybody's approach is definitely the
approach for Damien Maia is going to be

2140
01:22:54,611 --> 01:22:56,860
different than the approach for
wonderboy is going to be different than

2141
01:22:56,861 --> 01:22:58,600
your approach.
And it's,

2142
01:22:58,601 --> 01:23:00,880
it's so difficult to figure out who's
right.

2143
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,460
I mean it's really based on the success
of the past.

2144
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,770
Well,
if we take away the gloves and turn into

2145
01:23:05,771 --> 01:23:06,070
wonder

2146
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,830
boys kicking with Damien,
Maia is grappling.

2147
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,370
If we take where the gloves,
well there'll be a lot more chill,

2148
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:14,770
a lot more jokes and a lot more kicks.
You got to take away the gloves.

2149
01:23:14,771 --> 01:23:15,850
There we go.
Yeah,

2150
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:17,590
I mean it'd be,
it's so much easier to sync.

2151
01:23:17,591 --> 01:23:20,480
Chokes in so much harder as defend,
you know,

2152
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:23,680
change up the commands.
And then now when it comes to like if

2153
01:23:23,681 --> 01:23:27,700
you look at football or baseball or any
professional sport,

2154
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:30,310
they've pretty much have protocols that
are very similar.

2155
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:34,420
Like most teams have pretty similar
protocols as far as like training and

2156
01:23:34,421 --> 01:23:36,550
how they,
how they prepare their athletes.

2157
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:40,510
But with mma it's wildly different.
Like in how,

2158
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,081
who,
how,

2159
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:42,790
who decides?
Like for you,

2160
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:46,300
who decides what when you're doing
strength and conditioning,

2161
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:48,880
when you're doing hill sprints,
when you're doing sparring,

2162
01:23:48,881 --> 01:23:50,260
like how do you guys work that out?

2163
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:53,830
I find someone that I trust completely
and then uh,

2164
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:57,360
work together with him for my striking
in my mma with Dwayne.

2165
01:23:57,361 --> 01:23:59,580
It's something we team up together and
think of like,

2166
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,810
what if I do this?
What if I do that?

2167
01:24:00,811 --> 01:24:02,550
And it kind of make a perfect plan for
myself,

2168
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:04,440
my strength conditioning coach learning
and Dow,

2169
01:24:04,441 --> 01:24:08,460
I believe in him completely of watching
him train athletes and peak in meet the

2170
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:10,830
right way and how I feel personally.
It's all trial and error.

2171
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,930
Um,
you know where I'm at right now.

2172
01:24:12,931 --> 01:24:16,740
I trust in every single coach that for
different aspects leaser bowling for my

2173
01:24:16,741 --> 01:24:18,600
wrestling.
He's been around the game for so long

2174
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:21,390
and knows how fighting works that I'm
going to trust him and my wrestling

2175
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:23,070
techniques and help him pick me apart.
You know,

2176
01:24:23,071 --> 01:24:26,280
Elliot Marshall's meant Jujitsu coach.
I really believe in Colorado at

2177
01:24:26,281 --> 01:24:29,310
elevation fight team with me and Dwayne,
we really got got a pretty,

2178
01:24:29,311 --> 01:24:31,980
pretty good to figure it out.
But someone's going to come in and have

2179
01:24:31,981 --> 01:24:33,720
a different mindset of what they want to
do.

2180
01:24:33,721 --> 01:24:36,030
And if it doesn't work for you,
it doesn't work for you.

2181
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:37,301
Yeah.
It's just,

2182
01:24:37,301 --> 01:24:40,900
it's the trial and error and the
learning as you go along.

2183
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:42,400
It's so interesting because,
you know,

2184
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:43,960
you lose a fight and then you go,
God,

2185
01:24:43,961 --> 01:24:45,160
what,
what did we fuck up on?

2186
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:46,410
Where,
what do we need to do better?

2187
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:47,440
Yeah.
And then,

2188
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:48,820
you know,
maybe,

2189
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,650
you know,
you get that Joe Silva call like,

2190
01:24:50,651 --> 01:24:51,580
Hey,
you know,

2191
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,020
uh,
we have a fight in eight weeks.

2192
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:53,950
You Ready?
Ready to take it?

2193
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:57,250
So Sylvia called me when I was up on a
ladder doing electrical work in the

2194
01:24:57,251 --> 01:24:59,470
mountains to fight in two weeks.
And it was again,

2195
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,060
Jonathan Goulay.
So,

2196
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:02,050
uh,
I said,

2197
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:03,370
uh,
sure.

2198
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:06,230
I take the fight and then I'd text boss
right away or I call him and say,

2199
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,001
all right,
can you train me?

2200
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:07,451
It's like,
sure.

2201
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:08,710
His,
so go out for a week.

2202
01:25:08,711 --> 01:25:10,850
So yeah,
going back to the point where I worked

2203
01:25:10,851 --> 01:25:13,180
at West,
is Keto in history ever.

2204
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:13,911
You got it.
Well,

2205
01:25:13,911 --> 01:25:16,540
you got to fight for that money ever.
We had a fight for that one.

2206
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,490
Yes sir.
Mr Rogan,

2207
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:21,790
how many people were hating on him
having the fastest Kaylin history?

2208
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:26,791
There's a lot of fucking debate.
I was like the referee that it's wrong.

2209
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,210
It was,
it was a wrong call.

2210
01:25:28,211 --> 01:25:30,160
They were saying it was like 11 seconds
or something like that.

2211
01:25:30,161 --> 01:25:31,540
Sure.
Like Bull Shit.

2212
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,850
That was six.
We played it over and over and over

2213
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:34,850
again.
It was fine.

2214
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:35,310
No,
it's,

2215
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:38,710
we were working on that exact technique
does point down the jab moving overhand

2216
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:41,140
right in the back with Sensei and and
just just ripped it out,

2217
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:41,974
ripped it out and

2218
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,790
it was so fun because I'm leaning over
the cage and I'm saying Dwayne is going

2219
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:48,610
to come up straightforward.
I want you to step to the side and just

2220
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:50,560
knock them out.
You will hear me say that,

2221
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:51,910
repeating it over and over.
I say,

2222
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:54,580
I don't know what because every time I
have that I have one time I said he's

2223
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:57,940
opening for the right location and then
the guy over through the right log,

2224
01:25:57,941 --> 01:25:59,050
you get out.
How do you know what?

2225
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,310
They have no clue.
Every time it works with us or against

2226
01:26:01,311 --> 01:26:02,410
boulevard,
we knocked him out.

2227
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,860
That combination.
We weren't

2228
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,330
get the dressing room before Bomani.
I mean it's all the time we'd Goulay for

2229
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:10,190
some reason I go,
he's got to come straight out.

2230
01:26:10,191 --> 01:26:12,910
You just move out and just don't do
anything.

2231
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,500
It's Kinda data chunking.
You've seen so many fights,

2232
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:19,370
so many people you have to see things
and you don't even know what you're

2233
01:26:19,371 --> 01:26:20,210
seeing.
Just like,

2234
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:23,270
oh like you know how sometimes like
you'll see a guy like I call it all the

2235
01:26:23,271 --> 01:26:24,780
time.
I'll see a guy lifted his heel up and

2236
01:26:24,781 --> 01:26:26,060
when he said about throw right case.
Yeah,

2237
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:29,150
like you just know for whatever reason
twist a little bit.

2238
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:32,300
Yeah.
Then the funny part is when he does a

2239
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,190
backache,
nine out of 10 times,

2240
01:26:34,191 --> 01:26:37,640
the other one throws a backache.
So I always thought I'm going to do this

2241
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:40,520
on purpose and hopefully when he makes
them on I'm going to catch it.

2242
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:45,130
Then
I'll go do this too.

2243
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,930
It's crazy when people throw back.
Well,

2244
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:52,010
like the,
the probably the most ill advised back

2245
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:54,820
heck of all time was Chris Weidman
versus Luke Rocco.

2246
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:57,710
Maybe the most that called.
It's called at the moment.

2247
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:01,550
What do you mean his corner?
Call it at the moment he called it,

2248
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:06,230
I think maybe it's here's luke had been
knocked out by veto with a wheel kick.

2249
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:10,100
So maybe I'm just guessing that Chris
decided to throw a wheel kick,

2250
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,770
but it was like you could see it
comment,

2251
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,930
it wasn't fast and if you don't know
100% how to cake,

2252
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:17,870
I said don't kick and he shouldn't have
done that.

2253
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:20,060
It was way too slow and they saw it
coming off.

2254
01:27:20,061 --> 01:27:22,010
A memory of that though when,
ah,

2255
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:24,200
be toward Belford did it?
Um,

2256
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:27,950
I think I remember correctly rockhold
was against the cage.

2257
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:29,450
Correct?
Cause he's all circle off.

2258
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,010
Yes.
He was aware of the cage.

2259
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:33,030
Now weidman's back was against the
kitsch.

2260
01:27:33,031 --> 01:27:35,870
I thought he was close with the cage
then luke was in that fight.

2261
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,260
I don't believe so.
No,

2262
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:38,840
I believe he was moving.
It was a belief.

2263
01:27:38,841 --> 01:27:41,130
It was the same thing.
He was moving towards rockhold on,

2264
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:44,060
I don't remember that direction,
but I remember the talk them through it

2265
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,880
before and it was the first time I'd
ever seen him throw a wheel kick.

2266
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,820
He threw it right before against
rockhold and missed and they threw it

2267
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:51,070
again and landed them.
Nice.

2268
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,720
Yep.
TRT Tour.

2269
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,720
He told me before,
he says,

2270
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:01,800
boss,
my kicks should go to be getting a

2271
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:04,940
really good right now,
somebody out with a spinning back kick

2272
01:28:04,941 --> 01:28:05,661
to the head.
I said,

2273
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:07,610
go for it then.
Then he knocked him out.

2274
01:28:07,611 --> 01:28:12,410
So Vito has had so many hand surgeries,
I believe he's had a sucker off for

2275
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:15,440
enhanced surgeries.
He's broken his hand so many times that

2276
01:28:15,441 --> 01:28:17,540
I think he just started concentrating
more on kicks,

2277
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:19,520
you know,
just see that made a big difference.

2278
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:22,970
This is going back to a patterns and
seeing people that the hill up,

2279
01:28:22,971 --> 01:28:23,830
you know,
they're gonna throw something.

2280
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,460
Well,
figure out what they're going to do.

2281
01:28:25,461 --> 01:28:29,030
But then that same theory is paying
attention to what combinations and what

2282
01:28:29,031 --> 01:28:31,580
techniques actually land and then
chucking those together and making

2283
01:28:31,581 --> 01:28:32,321
those,
the system.

2284
01:28:32,321 --> 01:28:33,440
So just being,
having,

2285
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:36,200
going back to the language and the
vocabulary of high percentage

2286
01:28:36,201 --> 01:28:38,030
combinations,
drill them and wrap them out.

2287
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,770
So just it's not too bad.
Yeah.

2288
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:43,770
And know how to really deliver a
technique before you attempt it.

2289
01:28:43,771 --> 01:28:47,900
Like the first time I ever saw Cain
Velasquez for a wheel kick ever was in

2290
01:28:47,901 --> 01:28:50,090
the Travis Brown fight and it looked
fucking perfect.

2291
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:52,010
Cause like what does this guy have been
hiding this forever?

2292
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:54,410
Like he never threw a wheel kick and all
of a sudden it's a perfect,

2293
01:28:54,411 --> 01:28:56,390
we'll kick.
But it's probably because he had

2294
01:28:56,391 --> 01:28:59,960
practiced them this and drilled it to
the point where he's got it down.

2295
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:01,890
It's like all right,
time to the wheel kick.

2296
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:02,030
You

2297
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:04,080
had a lifeline.
He has a lifelong martial artist in his

2298
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:05,120
corner,
however you're going this.

2299
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:09,060
So I'm sure he's seen a million back
kicks and can correct him on what to do

2300
01:29:09,061 --> 01:29:10,680
properly rather than,
than what he's doing wrong.

2301
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:12,241
But it's just,
it was,

2302
01:29:12,241 --> 01:29:14,370
it's interesting when you see a guy like
out of nowhere.

2303
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,080
Yes sir.
Hold technique that you've never seen

2304
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:16,710
before.
Hi.

2305
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:18,600
Hello athletes.
I can show tj anything.

2306
01:29:18,601 --> 01:29:20,880
Right or watch videos and see something.
He could pull it off right away.

2307
01:29:20,881 --> 01:29:22,890
It's a great visual learner.
I'm a great visual learner.

2308
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,650
So sensei is like,
I can learn by watching papes and

2309
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:27,870
watching somebody do something.
I can just mimic it.

2310
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:29,580
So and Tj,
so consensus.

2311
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:32,310
It's just the way it is.
I wonder what the next technique that

2312
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:35,700
we're going to see that we couldn't
believe someone's pulling off inside the

2313
01:29:35,701 --> 01:29:36,190
entre.

2314
01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:39,900
Yeah,
it really close line with disclosure and

2315
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:41,400
elbows to the,
to the,

2316
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,340
to the collarbone.
I saw some of the Atlanta close line

2317
01:29:44,341 --> 01:29:45,630
recently do that.
That's fine.

2318
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:48,030
It's going to be over.
I saw someone do that and I was thinking

2319
01:29:48,031 --> 01:29:51,690
of you because you've talked about that
so many times that like oh your bag.

2320
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:54,330
They attached to a US both on to twitter
feed,

2321
01:29:54,331 --> 01:29:55,470
right?
It wasn't turned to somebody.

2322
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,080
Yes.
Is it close side,

2323
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,400
but the coolest nine if you really do
it,

2324
01:29:59,401 --> 01:30:01,730
they can cover up with their hands but
you're still going to hit him.

2325
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,470
You loop around and your rope around to
the back of the head,

2326
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,030
which still outside the Mohawk still
illegal pudge.

2327
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:08,770
Oh yeah.
I know her feed is completed and Eagle,

2328
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:10,800
he moved his head and our didn't move
his head and it's his fault.

2329
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:12,090
Well also,
you know,

2330
01:30:12,091 --> 01:30:14,010
Eddie Bravo and I had a conversation
about this,

2331
01:30:14,011 --> 01:30:18,270
like when you hit a guy with a head kick
a lot of times is landing on the back of

2332
01:30:18,271 --> 01:30:18,530
the hat.

2333
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:20,270
Yeah.
A lot of times the food,

2334
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,440
it's coming over the shoulder a lot of
times,

2335
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:24,570
like the,
the foot is impacting the instep is

2336
01:30:24,571 --> 01:30:27,330
hitting the back of the head before
anything and nobody's ready for that

2337
01:30:27,331 --> 01:30:29,540
impact.
Everybody in fact ready for the sites

2338
01:30:29,541 --> 01:30:30,970
and to the front,
uh,

2339
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:31,800
which,
uh,

2340
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,360
Tyson,
he hits hooks.

2341
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:35,190
He was always the smallest guy,
shortest guy.

2342
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:37,840
But he would hit his hook almost to the
Becca,

2343
01:30:37,841 --> 01:30:39,990
a hat.
Here's which was so short at that,

2344
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:40,980
you know,
you,

2345
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:41,910
I always say,
do you know,

2346
01:30:41,911 --> 01:30:43,620
just hit yourself really gentle and to
be,

2347
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:46,890
but the palm and the back of your head,
your brain is simply not ready for that.

2348
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,800
Yeah.
I'm one of the best head kick Kaos I've

2349
01:30:49,801 --> 01:30:51,570
ever seen that came from the back of the
head.

2350
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,790
Was there Nesto who's versus Maury
Smith?

2351
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:54,690
I did.
You ever see that?

2352
01:30:54,970 --> 01:30:55,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

2353
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:57,810
Yeah.
Jamie find that because it's such a

2354
01:30:57,811 --> 01:31:01,350
crazy combination.
The way host gets his leg up there in

2355
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:05,160
the middle of a clinch and Maurice I
believe,

2356
01:31:05,161 --> 01:31:10,161
picks his knee up and host comes over
the top and down behind his head.

2357
01:31:11,011 --> 01:31:13,770
Sexual judge era style.
Yeah.

2358
01:31:13,771 --> 01:31:15,680
He just did a seminar kicking over to
defense.

2359
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:17,620
Yeah,
right there and it's like what you say

2360
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:20,190
before is say you take a punch it and
put it on the head.

2361
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,570
You're going to let me just hit the
punishment.

2362
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,250
Like if you have your hands up,
it makes no sense.

2363
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,020
Yeah.
Having your hands up.

2364
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:26,880
You think the guys protected.
Now don't punch him.

2365
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:28,680
Put your hands up.
Let me punch you.

2366
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:29,750
Let me touch your hands.
Right,

2367
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,130
right.
I've always got a kick blocked my kid.

2368
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:34,650
Come on.
It's a misconception of people when they

2369
01:31:34,651 --> 01:31:36,930
put their hands up,
but this is what goes on.

2370
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,670
If I want to hitch Kikuyu into hat
today,

2371
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:41,670
she put your hand up.
A normal person automatically thinks the

2372
01:31:41,671 --> 01:31:43,740
power of the kick because he sees his
defendant,

2373
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:47,690
but if he just would not care and just
kick as hard as she can on the defense,

2374
01:31:47,691 --> 01:31:49,240
you will kick them out and it just got
to knock them out.

2375
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,570
Let this last weekend we saw a Yancey
Madeiros fraud.

2376
01:31:51,571 --> 01:31:54,670
Sean Spencer's Spencer blocked the kick
and he took it right to the,

2377
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,370
to the head.
Check this out real quick.

2378
01:31:56,820 --> 01:32:00,180
This is a Maury Smith versus Ernesto

2379
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,490
who's play it,
play the whole thing so he could see

2380
01:32:02,491 --> 01:32:04,510
that the combination seat,
boom,

2381
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:10,130
he does it in the clench with the knee
boone's add edesa rumbled,

2382
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:14,470
deckers kind of style and I like the
push and the cake that ahead.

2383
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:18,280
He started with that at all.
It was able to bring it up in a round

2384
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:20,710
like that too.
It's crazy to realize he was in the

2385
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:21,790
clinch,
a block to shoulder,

2386
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:23,370
almost his hand down for him.
Yeah.

2387
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:24,640
It kind of guides his hand out of the
way.

2388
01:32:24,641 --> 01:32:26,020
So was kicks in to come up and lay me in
the head.

2389
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:29,410
That's also where like flexibility is so
critical,

2390
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:33,490
like there's no more important thing
when it comes to kicking technique.

2391
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:35,800
Then flexibility,
because if you don't have the

2392
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:37,960
flexibility,
your body's all stiff and it doesn't

2393
01:32:37,961 --> 01:32:39,760
move.
Right and you just can't.

2394
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:42,150
There's no,
no one's going to do that unless it,

2395
01:32:42,151 --> 01:32:42,940
you're flexible.

2396
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:43,840
Yeah.
Got a stretch.

2397
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:46,780
Can I do the stretch your routine?
It was such a good guy.

2398
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:53,020
This who is that one Croatian do?
They kept knocking him out.

2399
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:56,170
Yeah.
That fucking guy hits

2400
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:01,530
the animal.
They know his gay was the first gay porn

2401
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:02,940
champion.
He was announced.

2402
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,370
That's right.
Yeah.

2403
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,830
It's not the k.
He knocked him out yesterday.

2404
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:08,890
Yeah,
his muscles also,

2405
01:33:08,891 --> 01:33:10,960
when you see it,
he's like different kind of muscle.

2406
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:14,590
It almost looks like it is very strong.
Know there's some dudes like that.

2407
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:17,070
Yeah.
There's a long time for him to do to

2408
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:20,380
break the ice with me at a,
suddenly he came to me and he goes,

2409
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,250
you're a funny guy.
But if took like four times of meeting

2410
01:33:24,251 --> 01:33:24,730
him,
he was,

2411
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:28,090
he had no clue what to expect.
That's a hard part of the world.

2412
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:32,010
There is a hard part of the world.
I'll probably talk to relax.

2413
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:35,680
You got to be on guard the whole time.
I think to this day,

2414
01:33:35,681 --> 01:33:40,120
the greatest stare down of all time was
cro cop versus vandelay and vandelay

2415
01:33:40,121 --> 01:33:42,100
would mean mug everybody and it would
work.

2416
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,630
He looked at Cro,
cop and Cro.

2417
01:33:43,631 --> 01:33:45,000
Cop looked at him like,
motherfucker,

2418
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:47,410
I'll cut your head off.
It was like,

2419
01:33:47,411 --> 01:33:49,600
oh,
he's dead.

2420
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,140
The second fight,
that was the second fight.

2421
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:56,170
But in the first fight,
I mean you never saw the eyes of a

2422
01:33:56,171 --> 01:33:58,930
killer more than than that,
that one time.

2423
01:33:58,931 --> 01:34:01,750
Cause I mean,
I mean he was ahead of an anti terrorist

2424
01:34:01,751 --> 01:34:03,250
squadron and Croatia.
I mean,

2425
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:06,220
but you see I go back again.
That was defended late,

2426
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:09,700
always intimidating somebody.
And now you have suddenly a guy who does

2427
01:34:09,701 --> 01:34:11,020
not care.
He's not only that,

2428
01:34:11,021 --> 01:34:14,500
your strong suit is striking and you're
taking on one of the most explosive

2429
01:34:14,501 --> 01:34:17,170
structures to ever compete in MMA.
And a guy who,

2430
01:34:17,171 --> 01:34:19,990
you know was a legit k one level
striker.

2431
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:21,130
Yup.
But he would say,

2432
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,360
you know,
it's interesting how that,

2433
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:27,361
that style really worked really well.
Like here it is likely the stare down,

2434
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:32,650
look at Cro cop,
they get fuck it stared out.

2435
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:37,860
I mean that's God damn terrifying and
I'm leaving and they're legit as fuck.

2436
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,560
He's not believing in vandelay very
much.

2437
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:45,430
But it's interesting because Cro cop was
successful in k one but he was never the

2438
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:48,010
elite of the elite.
But his style,

2439
01:34:48,011 --> 01:34:52,570
that explosive one shot style translated
so well to mma.

2440
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:57,290
Whereas maybe like Ernesto style would
not have translated that way because he

2441
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,310
was more technical,

2442
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:00,470
set things up more.
What I show,

2443
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:01,850
no single kicks.
I always say,

2444
01:35:01,851 --> 01:35:04,130
because they can be countered and I
always say,

2445
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:08,480
are you kick like Mirko Cro Cop?
Because if you then kick really hard on

2446
01:35:08,481 --> 01:35:10,400
the defense,
you're buying yourself a little bit more

2447
01:35:10,401 --> 01:35:12,440
time because they,
you force them to block it.

2448
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:14,360
But some of these guys with the left
kicks,

2449
01:35:14,361 --> 01:35:15,800
if they're the,
they're the orthodox,

2450
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,750
they can't kick.
I say take the cake,

2451
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:19,140
whatever it is.
You're going to give you a rashy.

2452
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,300
I mean,
he's not going to do anything.

2453
01:35:20,301 --> 01:35:22,550
It's they're going to keep muscle.
Just counter the cake.

2454
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:24,840
Well,
when cro complicates of full blast Gig,

2455
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:27,080
you're going to be forced to block and
then you can counter,

2456
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:30,160
which buys him a little bit of time to
get out of the way again,

2457
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:31,750
that tells tj and his last ride of the
sensee.

2458
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,550
I'll just wait for the kick in step in
until the cross time him on the way in.

2459
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:36,650
There's levels to everything,
right,

2460
01:35:36,651 --> 01:35:41,030
and there's levels to kicking and Edson
Barboza switch kick is yes.

2461
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:43,580
That's one of those things where I
watched that and I go,

2462
01:35:43,581 --> 01:35:46,750
what the fuck?
I'm never seen anybody switch kicked

2463
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,480
that fast.
Quick,

2464
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:53,650
which is inside leg kick.
He can win a whole fight with all benny.

2465
01:35:54,471 --> 01:35:55,410
The jet,
a

2466
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,870
spinning back kick to the body.
Oh,

2467
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:02,300
he's back into the body one.
It gets Fujiwara.

2468
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,450
I mean I saw it at the of his kings of
the square ring.

2469
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:08,540
When you see him,
you can hear the impact on the bud.

2470
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:11,210
It goes,
you see the guy crumble.

2471
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,130
Benny.
The jet was sad motherfucker.

2472
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:16,070
The best American kickbox forever.
Yeah,

2473
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:18,710
he's a bar without a doubt.
One of them told him and then I would

2474
01:36:18,711 --> 01:36:20,670
say Rick Rufus,
such a pioneer too.

2475
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:21,740
I mean,
you know shit.

2476
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:25,310
He was doing that back when there was
really no one at that level.

2477
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:29,420
I mean he was at such a high level.
It's such a while due to again Mexican,

2478
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:31,880
native American.
It was dizzy.

2479
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:34,910
Oh is he?
Or maybe a mix,

2480
01:36:34,911 --> 01:36:36,610
but I'm pretty soon cause he's a come
out with the headdress.

2481
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:40,740
Blinky Rodriguez,
who was his brother in law was Mexican.

2482
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:44,260
I saw him in Holland coming in.
He was fighting spotting.

2483
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,520
He wants Bong.
It was a big bike guy.

2484
01:36:46,521 --> 01:36:48,860
Strong,
strong kickboxer and Ben,

2485
01:36:48,861 --> 01:36:52,320
he never fought with low kicks and
spying is murdering him.

2486
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:54,620
And the first right,
everybody's for spying spine go wgu

2487
01:36:54,621 --> 01:36:58,340
going and he gets loci.
LOCI cause I don't know how he stayed in

2488
01:36:58,341 --> 01:36:59,091
the fight,
Benny,

2489
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:01,100
right.
The second five second route,

2490
01:37:01,101 --> 01:37:03,180
he starts coming in a little bit and
there was five frauds.

2491
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:07,790
Five to the time because Thai boxing and
a third two out and now better jeff

2492
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:11,410
starts coming back and suddenly spunks
that spitting out his mouthpiece because

2493
01:37:11,411 --> 01:37:13,340
he needed an extra break and I need it
again.

2494
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:16,400
And it did it again.
And then it was like rocky versus Ivan

2495
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,890
Drago you.
So literally the whole audience changed

2496
01:37:18,891 --> 01:37:23,030
from being for the Dutch guy to be for
betty to jet because they realized this

2497
01:37:23,031 --> 01:37:26,060
guy is so tough.
But he keeps hanging in there and then

2498
01:37:26,061 --> 01:37:28,880
betty jet stopped them into forthright.
It was the craziest thing.

2499
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:32,540
People were going nuts.
If you spit out as a mouthpiece,

2500
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:33,620
he wants spunk.
Everybody.

2501
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:34,980
Whoa.
You know,

2502
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:37,520
he wasn't doing heroin.
It was the coolest thing I've ever seen.

2503
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:40,190
Did you watch glory this weekend?
No,

2504
01:37:40,191 --> 01:37:41,820
but I heard it was really good.
Right?

2505
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:44,720
And waste and wilderness knocked out
Simon Marcus.

2506
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:48,470
Oh Wow.
And Marcus was lighten them up early in

2507
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:49,720
the fight.
Light a mosque.

2508
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:52,590
He's like 44 and two right.
Mark has showed that though.

2509
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:54,050
Three of them right now.
Yeah,

2510
01:37:54,051 --> 01:37:56,070
he lost to shilling and that crazy

2511
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:59,010
fight where they went that extra round.
And schilling knocked him out with a

2512
01:37:59,011 --> 01:38:00,450
right hook,
which is just,

2513
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:04,110
it was an insane fight.
That was the tournament too.

2514
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:07,500
That was the first fight of that
tournament and Schilling for two more

2515
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:10,320
times after that fucking crazy fight.
But the,

2516
01:38:10,321 --> 01:38:11,370
uh,
the wilderness fight,

2517
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:15,540
Simon markets was lightened him up,
man with Moy Thai and wellness is more

2518
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:19,050
of a boxer style and he was moving in
and he had some,

2519
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:22,320
some success with combinations,
but then he caught him at the end of the

2520
01:38:22,321 --> 01:38:26,940
round a way that with a shot and uh,
Simon mark was kind of playing with them

2521
01:38:26,941 --> 01:38:30,240
and lowered his hands,
was smiling and he got hit with a couple

2522
01:38:30,241 --> 01:38:33,030
of shots and the referee gave him a real
questionable standing eight count.

2523
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,260
And the,
the,

2524
01:38:34,261 --> 01:38:36,250
the commentators are screaming,
Joseph Valtellina,

2525
01:38:36,251 --> 01:38:37,800
he was screaming like,
that's ridiculous.

2526
01:38:37,801 --> 01:38:39,180
They shouldn't do this.
Is that,

2527
01:38:39,181 --> 01:38:40,800
that's not a,
the eight counts.

2528
01:38:40,801 --> 01:38:42,030
No good.
He wasn't about to go down.

2529
01:38:42,031 --> 01:38:43,740
There's no standing eight count and
kickboxing.

2530
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:45,730
Like why did they count them?
Like they're saying that the,

2531
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,900
the ropes held them up.
Then the next round wellness just

2532
01:38:48,901 --> 01:38:52,600
fucking dropped him legit and hurt him
bad and then dropped him again and then

2533
01:38:52,601 --> 01:38:53,434
finish them off

2534
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:55,600
for Uber.
I'm looking forward to him fighting

2535
01:38:55,601 --> 01:38:59,200
Butler December 10th right.
God Damn.

2536
01:38:59,201 --> 01:39:01,690
That's going to be nuts.
Badr Hari is one of the scariest

2537
01:39:01,691 --> 01:39:03,820
motherfuckers ever walked the face of
the planet.

2538
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:08,170
I have no clue how he's still out of
jail.

2539
01:39:08,171 --> 01:39:09,880
Out of jail.
I guess he's got money.

2540
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:14,830
It ain't cause they said it was maybe
going to be in Morocco.

2541
01:39:14,831 --> 01:39:16,210
I go,
don't do it in Morocco.

2542
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:18,580
Do it because if you beat him,
that's got to be a problem,

2543
01:39:18,581 --> 01:39:20,510
I think.
Yeah.

2544
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:22,300
Yeah.
Didn't he rob a bank,

2545
01:39:22,301 --> 01:39:23,270
right?
No,

2546
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:23,571
no,
no,

2547
01:39:23,571 --> 01:39:25,230
no.
Let him beat up

2548
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:28,030
Morocco,
but okay.

2549
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:28,953
Okay.
Sorry.

2550
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:30,270
Brass knuckles.
I,

2551
01:39:30,271 --> 01:39:31,250
my story is better

2552
01:39:34,070 --> 01:39:37,110
beat some guy up at a nightclub where he
stomped his shin,

2553
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,260
the,
they held a guy down and he's allegedly

2554
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,370
stomped on his shin and snapped it in
half.

2555
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:45,780
Yeah.
That's not being a good person,

2556
01:39:45,781 --> 01:39:48,630
you know,
and like Tan and I think that's what he

2557
01:39:48,631 --> 01:39:50,010
was going forward.
But I don't think so.

2558
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:55,320
Stories like that.
Do you have many of them from him?

2559
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:57,570
That's not good.
Not Good.

2560
01:39:57,650 --> 01:40:00,590
Obviously I'm a huge fan of MMA.
I think the Nima Amaze the most exciting

2561
01:40:00,591 --> 01:40:03,860
sport in the world.
But there's some things that you see in

2562
01:40:03,861 --> 01:40:07,460
kickboxing that you just don't see in
mma because there's no threat of the

2563
01:40:07,461 --> 01:40:10,460
tank down.
So you see these wild technical

2564
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:13,910
exchanges and in my opinion,
we need more of that.

2565
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:15,230
You know,
it just is not enough.

2566
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:17,840
There's not enough eyes on it.
Just don't think enough people are

2567
01:40:17,841 --> 01:40:18,674
paying attention.

2568
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:21,760
Phenomenal show glory.
It is phenomenal now.

2569
01:40:21,761 --> 01:40:24,760
That's why I don't understand the
numbers have a why he's not,

2570
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:28,120
not many more people watching it.
And especially the guys who are

2571
01:40:28,121 --> 01:40:31,190
complaining about not understanding
mixed martial arts.

2572
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:32,590
Well,
the punch you can gigging,

2573
01:40:32,650 --> 01:40:36,970
everybody can understand that.
And like 85 or 85% knockout ratio.

2574
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:37,570
Yes sir.
Yeah,

2575
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:38,403
it's a great show.

2576
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:41,980
I Love Glory,
but I like lion fight better.

2577
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:45,970
I like traditional ties.
I just feel like glory would be even

2578
01:40:45,971 --> 01:40:48,220
better if they just went more Thai.
Because why?

2579
01:40:48,221 --> 01:40:50,950
Why take away elbows when widen.
Why no elbows?

2580
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:52,510
Ah,
I'm not a big fan elvis just because of

2581
01:40:52,511 --> 01:40:53,690
the cuts cuts too easy.

2582
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,770
Um,
but then also limiting the clinch time

2583
01:40:56,771 --> 01:40:58,300
cause the crunch time can be boring.
Right.

2584
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:00,550
So I think like the k one rules are
more,

2585
01:41:00,551 --> 01:41:03,010
I liked the Cuban roles or Gloria rules
better for that aspect.

2586
01:41:03,011 --> 01:41:06,010
For the handpiece fight,
but or just a in the clinch keep abos

2587
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:08,350
but in the clinch,
just a don't allow them to play around,

2588
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:09,940
play around as long.
See,

2589
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,830
I understand what you're saying about
elbows,

2590
01:41:11,831 --> 01:41:13,600
but part of me is like,
look,

2591
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:17,920
it's a striking contest.
Why would you eliminate one of the best

2592
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:21,070
weapons in striking,
which is elbows and lion fight has

2593
01:41:21,071 --> 01:41:21,851
these,
I mean,

2594
01:41:21,851 --> 01:41:23,590
look,
they get caught up like for sure.

2595
01:41:23,591 --> 01:41:26,230
Like do you see Gaston Balano since on
one of his face Ninja,

2596
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:30,070
he gets cut the fuck up.
His opponents cut the fuck up.

2597
01:41:30,071 --> 01:41:31,840
They're blasting each other with
spinning elbows.

2598
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:34,700
But it's fun as hell to watch.
Yeah,

2599
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:36,970
definitely fun to watch.
I'm not trying to be in there anymore at

2600
01:41:36,971 --> 01:41:37,804
all.

2601
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:43,840
Much easier just to quit coaching Tj and
coaching the guys and teach them martial

2602
01:41:43,841 --> 01:41:45,670
arts and evening what I want and hanging
out.

2603
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:50,650
I totally respect that.
I just think like as a person who

2604
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:55,390
appreciates the purity of the art,
I just feel like there's no reason to

2605
01:41:55,391 --> 01:41:58,600
take out those clinch battles and
there's no reason to take out those

2606
01:41:58,601 --> 01:42:01,210
elbows because the guys who are good at
those clinch battles,

2607
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,640
you know,
they just start fucking blasting each

2608
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:07,570
other with knees to the body and it has
a significant tall and then the elbow

2609
01:42:07,571 --> 01:42:09,370
battles that they have inside the
clinch.

2610
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:12,010
It to me it's a,
it's a really important part of the

2611
01:42:12,011 --> 01:42:13,330
world.
Stand up striking.

2612
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,410
I see that.
Yes sir.

2613
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,210
Agreed.
We had a,

2614
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:17,830
we were talking about earlier,
600 euro.

2615
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:21,220
He just did a seminar at my academy and
he showed us really cool clinch elbow

2616
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:21,850
knee techniques.

2617
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:26,850
It was nice to get it from an actual
pure Muay Thai fighter to see his look

2618
01:42:27,341 --> 01:42:29,920
and his perspective of what can happen
in the clinch knot.

2619
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:30,940
That was,
that was eye opening.

2620
01:42:30,941 --> 01:42:32,200
It was cool.
Yeah.

2621
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:36,220
I think if we didn't have those guys,
we wouldn't know that we will.

2622
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:39,520
We would have only the level of striking
that we see in mma.

2623
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:40,960
And I think,
you know,

2624
01:42:40,961 --> 01:42:42,900
when you go and you watch like,
uh,

2625
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:44,420
Ramon dekkers fuck,
you know,

2626
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:46,570
you watch like him in his prime and you
realize,

2627
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:47,980
okay,
this is possible.

2628
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:49,840
Like there's,
there's levels to this fucking thing.

2629
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:51,070
Oh,
Jordan mean,

2630
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:52,023
right.
Yeah.

2631
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,590
His elbows.
Oh Man.

2632
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:54,640
Retired hired.

2633
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:55,151
Yeah,
no,

2634
01:42:55,151 --> 01:42:56,230
he's coming back.
He is,

2635
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:56,921
I heard,
yeah,

2636
01:42:56,921 --> 01:43:00,510
I talked to his father was a,
it was the Boston then this the most so,

2637
01:43:00,511 --> 01:43:01,344
yeah.
And uh,

2638
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,840
he told me he's going to be back here.
He's a black phone interview,

2639
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:04,680
right?
Yup.

2640
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,870
It's Paul as a fucking savage.
There's a picture of him on his

2641
01:43:07,871 --> 01:43:12,871
instagram page is like fifties pucker.
Yeah.

2642
01:43:13,421 --> 01:43:15,490
Jordan is a very,
very talented guy.

2643
01:43:15,491 --> 01:43:17,560
But um,
he had so many fights,

2644
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:18,670
you know,
as a young man.

2645
01:43:18,671 --> 01:43:19,930
I mean,
I think there's only 24,

2646
01:43:19,931 --> 01:43:21,370
25 and he retired.
Right.

2647
01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:24,370
That's what I tell everybody this
because they start competing too young.

2648
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:26,680
He competed when he was 15,
16 years old.

2649
01:43:26,681 --> 01:43:28,090
They have to lie about his age.
You know,

2650
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:29,950
you're going to burn out.
You shouldn't do that.

2651
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,340
Everybody's asking me.
I'd met this a girl now in a Phi Zalea

2652
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:34,540
12 year old Jenna.

2653
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:36,100
Um,
it started the following year.

2654
01:43:36,101 --> 01:43:37,660
I sent us to a whole bunch of gear and
stuff,

2655
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:38,141
you know,
I said,

2656
01:43:38,141 --> 01:43:39,490
because she says,
watch me,

2657
01:43:39,491 --> 01:43:41,220
I'm going to be the next Ronda Rousey.
So I go,

2658
01:43:41,221 --> 01:43:42,280
Hey,
I want to say that,

2659
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:43,660
but it's,
you know,

2660
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:44,860
it's the training.
It's uh,

2661
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:47,680
I,
I told her start sparring maybe when

2662
01:43:47,681 --> 01:43:49,720
you're 15 years old,
wait with that,

2663
01:43:49,721 --> 01:43:52,460
because your brain is still everything
through your nerves,

2664
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:53,690
you know,
at that age.

2665
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:56,420
And it stops at 14.
Just give it two more years,

2666
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,070
you know,
till all the connections are there.

2667
01:43:58,071 --> 01:44:00,020
And that may be start sparring by
competing.

2668
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:02,210
I would just wait,
wait for competing.

2669
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:04,430
Don't go in this early,
do Jujitsu,

2670
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,230
wrestling,
do all that.

2671
01:44:06,231 --> 01:44:08,600
But striking to the head,
I think they should wait with that.

2672
01:44:08,630 --> 01:44:11,360
Even even doing those things at a young
age and you make sure they're fun.

2673
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:12,920
You know,
like I almost got burnt out in wrestling

2674
01:44:12,921 --> 01:44:14,360
in eighth grade.
I wanted to quit.

2675
01:44:14,361 --> 01:44:15,800
I want to be done with the rest of this
too much.

2676
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:17,690
It was just because every weekend I'm
competing in that.

2677
01:44:17,691 --> 01:44:20,600
I'm so nervous as a little kid,
I'm putting so much pressure on myself.

2678
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:22,020
They're like,
I got to win this term.

2679
01:44:22,021 --> 01:44:24,050
I got to do good.
I like my dad was my coach.

2680
01:44:24,051 --> 01:44:25,310
I wanted to impress him.
All this stuff,

2681
01:44:25,311 --> 01:44:26,900
you know,
it's like eighth grade.

2682
01:44:26,901 --> 01:44:28,410
I was almost just gave it up,
you know?

2683
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:30,860
But you got to learn to learn to have
fun with everything.

2684
01:44:30,861 --> 01:44:33,320
As long as everything's fun,
like you can compete,

2685
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:35,560
do all that stuff.
I mean obviously kickboxing's little bit

2686
01:44:35,561 --> 01:44:37,850
different because you're going to go in
through some a brain trauma.

2687
01:44:37,851 --> 01:44:39,670
But what,
even with the wrestling and Jujitsu,

2688
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,080
make sure it's fine if you've got a
little kid that wants to do and a or a

2689
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:44,330
little kid that wants to get involved in
grappling and wrestling.

2690
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:45,890
Make sure it's fun.
You know,

2691
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:48,830
go in and practice playing some games,
news and things as well as learning

2692
01:44:48,831 --> 01:44:52,100
technique and cause little kids will get
burned out way too fast

2693
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,730
because we hit it as striking a lot,
right?

2694
01:44:55,731 --> 01:44:58,190
Aka to let striking to get injuries and
injuries down.

2695
01:44:58,230 --> 01:45:00,410
How many times should we spar whispbar
two times a day.

2696
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:05,450
Do we ever get injured
and we go,

2697
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:06,950
if people watch,
they go to go,

2698
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:08,120
oh,
these guys are crazy,

2699
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,340
but we know exactly what we hit,
where we kick it.

2700
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:13,150
It's all about sparring partners.
Now if you decide to your great part,

2701
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,980
sparring partner doesn't show up and you
get somebody from the club somewhere.

2702
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,120
Yeah.
Who has this?

2703
01:45:17,121 --> 01:45:19,400
We at you doesn't.
It's not as professional.

2704
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:20,510
Yeah,
you get injured,

2705
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:23,610
but I never been injured.
Inspiring and we

2706
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:30,960
give bus route and settled down.
But same with you.

2707
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:33,020
You'll never get an engine.
We will explore.

2708
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:36,680
What did you think about cowboys?
Serone deciding no more sparring.

2709
01:45:36,681 --> 01:45:38,270
He doesn't spar.
He just does drills.

2710
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:40,970
You're talking about that and look
sensational.

2711
01:45:40,971 --> 01:45:42,950
In his last fight.
He looks at a station will,

2712
01:45:42,951 --> 01:45:44,520
because he's still,
he,

2713
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:47,720
he still was sparring before that,
you know,

2714
01:45:47,721 --> 01:45:49,220
it's closer,
but the fruit of your stairway,

2715
01:45:49,221 --> 01:45:51,500
it's like a lawler.
He said he never spotted.

2716
01:45:51,501 --> 01:45:53,690
Finally he started sparring.
He started sparring.

2717
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,150
Any became much better.
See,

2718
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:57,460
I look at that.
I think your reflects his knee.

2719
01:45:57,630 --> 01:46:00,860
Reflexes need to be tested all the time.
If you're going to fight,

2720
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:03,800
well then you're going to have to fight
in training because that's what's got to

2721
01:46:03,801 --> 01:46:05,570
happen.
Unexpected things,

2722
01:46:05,571 --> 01:46:06,830
unexpected techniques.
You know,

2723
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,080
you need to be prepared for that.
If you just spar,

2724
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:10,460
you don't know what I'm going to throw
at you.

2725
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:12,980
You get three show lies a counter on my
right straight.

2726
01:46:12,981 --> 01:46:15,530
Well what if I set it up as a one,
two instead of just the right straight?

2727
01:46:15,850 --> 01:46:16,683
Yes.

2728
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:18,290
With that being said,
sorry.

2729
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:19,070
Um,
is,

2730
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:21,800
is if we're talking about sparring,
but it's not just full on fight

2731
01:46:21,801 --> 01:46:23,630
sparring,
but there's a whole level of sparring

2732
01:46:23,631 --> 01:46:25,600
drills that you can play with the mimics
scenarios.

2733
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:26,810
Going back to the patterns,
right.

2734
01:46:26,811 --> 01:46:29,170
And like what's a typical pattern?
The Jab Cross,

2735
01:46:29,171 --> 01:46:32,420
there were low kick learning how to deal
with those things in the motion.

2736
01:46:32,421 --> 01:46:33,530
But while you're doing that,
Joel,

2737
01:46:33,531 --> 01:46:35,210
yet to had the clear mind like you're in
the fight,

2738
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,750
but know that you're going to be here to
be countering the jab.

2739
01:46:37,751 --> 01:46:40,730
You're sending somebody up with a jab,
but not just going in finding guys,

2740
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:43,190
I don't want this to be misled where
everyone's just fighting and sparring

2741
01:46:43,191 --> 01:46:45,710
hard,
but to do actual sparring drills because

2742
01:46:45,711 --> 01:46:48,860
there's a full path between hitting
myths and actual sparring and then

2743
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:50,310
that's the web of the sparring drills.

2744
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:53,000
Yeah.
I think cowboy also had an issue with

2745
01:46:53,001 --> 01:46:54,330
cutting the weight too.
Yes sir.

2746
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,920
Then he looks cut 70 cutting weight was
just too much for him at one seven he's

2747
01:46:57,921 --> 01:47:00,610
a fucking assassin.
I feel like we're so good at the one

2748
01:47:00,611 --> 01:47:02,630
seven and there's a lot less pressure on
me at first too.

2749
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:04,160
You know,
you got to go into a fight with just

2750
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:08,000
having fun and not thinking about like,
I'm supposed to win this fight for him

2751
01:47:08,001 --> 01:47:09,340
and he's going to a complete different
weight class.

2752
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:10,760
What is there to lose?
You know?

2753
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:12,680
And so I think that's what's helped him
out a lot too.

2754
01:47:12,681 --> 01:47:14,010
And I think he's kind of catching his
groove.

2755
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:15,670
He looked awesome that,
yeah,

2756
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:16,880
right.
The body left Duke,

2757
01:47:16,881 --> 01:47:17,510
right.
I kick,

2758
01:47:17,510 --> 01:47:19,580
I love it.
Anyone all full hits.

2759
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:21,830
If you sought a body shot,
I dug in there.

2760
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:23,960
Right.
And then wrap it up at the high kick.

2761
01:47:23,961 --> 01:47:25,700
I love the,
and the technique,

2762
01:47:25,701 --> 01:47:28,670
that technical aspect that was so,
there was no wind up.

2763
01:47:28,671 --> 01:47:33,200
There's no fucking no muscle behind it.
Everything's just perfect crack head

2764
01:47:33,201 --> 01:47:34,760
kick.
It was just God damn

2765
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:38,400
as far as developing somebody a,
I used to help him out when he was first

2766
01:47:38,401 --> 01:47:41,910
training in Colorado and he was so
wrapped up into his own style.

2767
01:47:41,911 --> 01:47:42,661
I would try to say,
no,

2768
01:47:42,661 --> 01:47:44,040
do this and do that.
But then I realized,

2769
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,720
look,
he even everyone needs to be their own

2770
01:47:45,721 --> 01:47:46,261
athlete.
You know,

2771
01:47:46,261 --> 01:47:47,490
you got to do what's,
what's good for you.

2772
01:47:47,491 --> 01:47:48,450
It feels natural.
Go ahead.

2773
01:47:48,451 --> 01:47:50,440
But um,
and then he's just a prime example of

2774
01:47:50,441 --> 01:47:52,530
someone you'd have to allow to be
themselves,

2775
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,720
you know,
but just kind of guide a little bit here

2776
01:47:54,721 --> 01:47:55,680
and there.
But you know,

2777
01:47:55,681 --> 01:47:57,300
he went down to Jackson's and liquid.
He's done.

2778
01:47:57,301 --> 01:47:58,134
He's,
he's amazing.

2779
01:47:58,150 --> 01:48:00,600
He's such an individual trying to,
we all are.

2780
01:48:00,601 --> 01:48:02,940
Yeah.
Cowboy and some other boxes.

2781
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:05,040
He's just,
he's a fucking wild man.

2782
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:07,500
W have yet.
Who's the weirdest guy you've ever

2783
01:48:07,501 --> 01:48:08,281
worked with?
Where you like,

2784
01:48:08,281 --> 01:48:09,450
Jesus,
I don't even know if I could

2785
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:14,210
and help this guy a
favor.

2786
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:15,680
Favor.
Yeah.

2787
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:16,783
Yeah,

2788
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:19,450
he does.
But he's not going to try to learn new

2789
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:19,840
things.

2790
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,890
Yeah.
He sat in the past,

2791
01:48:20,891 --> 01:48:22,120
so you know,
I gotta respect that.

2792
01:48:22,121 --> 01:48:23,650
And you've been successful.
There you go.

2793
01:48:23,651 --> 01:48:25,570
But the game has changed.
Now look at the results.

2794
01:48:25,870 --> 01:48:27,820
The game has changed.
You have to change along with it.

2795
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:29,980
Like the definition of insanity is doing
the same thing,

2796
01:48:29,981 --> 01:48:31,990
expecting different results.
You have to evolve.

2797
01:48:31,991 --> 01:48:36,400
We have to let the ego go and continue
to develop and train and learn.

2798
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:39,700
The has to happen.
Would you guys had personality conflicts

2799
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:40,990
for whatever reason,
you know,

2800
01:48:40,991 --> 01:48:42,640
no blame,
but whatever they were,

2801
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:43,600
you guys had.
But what was,

2802
01:48:43,601 --> 01:48:44,860
it was a great time when we were
together.

2803
01:48:44,861 --> 01:48:45,581
Like,
look what happened.

2804
01:48:45,581 --> 01:48:46,330
Look what flourish,
right?

2805
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:48,250
Yeah.
I became much mellor much better as a

2806
01:48:48,251 --> 01:48:50,200
martial art instructor,
being able to work with all the

2807
01:48:50,201 --> 01:48:51,034
athletes.
Right?

2808
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:52,300
Everyone,
we work together,

2809
01:48:52,301 --> 01:48:54,670
everybody rose.
So it was a good time as good wind when

2810
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:57,460
it worked out for me to go home and do
my own thing and uh,

2811
01:48:57,550 --> 01:48:59,260
things laid where they were.
Yeah.

2812
01:48:59,470 --> 01:49:03,310
You asked you about why you know him as
a good coach and the reason of that is

2813
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:05,140
what I already mentioned with the
training.

2814
01:49:05,141 --> 01:49:07,570
He's always there.
He's always there on time.

2815
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:12,520
He always goes full out and that work
ethic he took to be a coach.

2816
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:15,970
He will always be there with the guys
cutting way to doing everything.

2817
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:18,730
I guarantee you they can call you at
three o'clock in the middle of the

2818
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:19,690
night,
the day before to fight.

2819
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:23,950
Don't go,
just give me 30 seconds.

2820
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:26,020
But that's it.
That's it.

2821
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:30,160
If you have that drive and you are so
focused on one thing and he just put

2822
01:49:30,161 --> 01:49:31,440
that focus,
that's right.

2823
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:34,670
I'll be training all day long.
I'll get home and want to just like

2824
01:49:34,671 --> 01:49:36,470
relax.
Vego may watch some TV,

2825
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,580
just do nothing.
Right.

2826
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:39,320
And then maybe be like 12 o'clock at
night.

2827
01:49:39,321 --> 01:49:41,660
I'll get a text from duane like on
something on my fight,

2828
01:49:41,661 --> 01:49:42,980
what I should be doing,
what should be thinking about.

2829
01:49:42,990 --> 01:49:43,460
I'm like,
yeah,

2830
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:43,991
guys,
sorry.

2831
01:49:43,991 --> 01:49:45,910
Yeah,
it does not have to think about this all

2832
01:49:45,911 --> 01:49:48,040
night,
so he's the reason

2833
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,000
why he's so great.
He's like you said,

2834
01:49:49,001 --> 01:49:52,690
he's constantly thinking about it and he
cares how well I do.

2835
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:56,410
Before you fought Hanan Barao.
I was eating lunch in Vegas at the

2836
01:49:56,411 --> 01:49:58,570
hotel.
I had a bunch of my friends with me.

2837
01:49:58,571 --> 01:50:00,880
We're all getting ready for the fights.
Dwayne comes over,

2838
01:50:00,881 --> 01:50:01,511
hey man,
come on.

2839
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:02,590
Sit down.
How are you feeling?

2840
01:50:02,591 --> 01:50:04,440
How's your boom?
Sits down and just,

2841
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,241
we're going to do this,
blah,

2842
01:50:06,241 --> 01:50:06,491
blah,
blah,

2843
01:50:06,491 --> 01:50:07,380
blah.
I'm just going to stop.

2844
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:09,850
The whole thing is movement switches to
get to the side,

2845
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:11,380
the whole thing.
A brow browse his style.

2846
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:13,450
It's his style.
He's going to his and he just was

2847
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:17,980
fucking hundred miles an hour and
they're sitting there putting food on.

2848
01:50:17,981 --> 01:50:22,981
My Mom's gone and then he and me.
Yeah,

2849
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:24,611
that's right.
Yeah.

2850
01:50:24,611 --> 01:50:25,620
That was still got the same.

2851
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:28,861
This is good.
This is good.

2852
01:50:28,861 --> 01:50:30,010
This is good.
Boom.

2853
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:33,370
That's why you're so fucking good.
You know?

2854
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:36,400
And I don't like the term ocd man.
Obsessed.

2855
01:50:36,430 --> 01:50:40,060
I've dedicated my life to the arts.
I'll OCD is those weirdos washed her

2856
01:50:40,061 --> 01:50:41,530
hands a hundred times before you leave
the house.

2857
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,170
This is a different thing.
This is just,

2858
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,970
it's a positive session.
Yes sir.

2859
01:50:44,971 --> 01:50:47,310
Yeah.
I've dedicated my life to the arts.

2860
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:48,900
Oh Man.
So it's fun.

2861
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:49,711
I love it.
Yeah.

2862
01:50:49,711 --> 01:50:54,711
Pretty much everybody at this table has,
your method though is so uniquely Duane

2863
01:50:55,231 --> 01:50:58,350
and I really love your system.
I think that's so critical,

2864
01:50:58,530 --> 01:51:02,010
is that you've taken all your stuff and
you've written it out and you put it

2865
01:51:02,011 --> 01:51:05,430
into like this system where you can
really learn.

2866
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:09,900
And that's something that I learned from
rob came into the Cayman tapes who's

2867
01:51:09,901 --> 01:51:12,810
amazing.
He has a system and it's one of the

2868
01:51:12,811 --> 01:51:14,550
things that I learned when I,
when I was training with him,

2869
01:51:14,551 --> 01:51:19,050
it's like this guy has this system the
same way a lot of Jujitsu guys have a

2870
01:51:19,051 --> 01:51:20,160
system,
you know,

2871
01:51:20,161 --> 01:51:23,550
and it's like his,
his system of breaking things down and

2872
01:51:23,551 --> 01:51:27,020
movement and strikes that it's all like,
it's,

2873
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:31,320
it's all uh,
it has a pattern to us and you can

2874
01:51:31,321 --> 01:51:33,510
follow this pattern as a progression to
it.

2875
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:36,670
And with the way the world is today,
you can learn it all from him online.

2876
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:39,270
You know,
like he's so good at breaking things

2877
01:51:39,271 --> 01:51:41,640
down and build a to film it and show it
to people that I can,

2878
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:44,490
you can go on as online academy and
learn exactly what I'm doing.

2879
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,250
You know,
all you need is a willing yeah.

2880
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:48,110
Participants.
So I want to train with you is going to

2881
01:51:48,111 --> 01:51:49,840
do the same amount of work that you are.
Yep.

2882
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,173
Agreed.
Yeah,

2883
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:52,550
it's fun.
I love it.

2884
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:55,490
I definitely love it.
It gives me thrive and passion and a

2885
01:51:55,491 --> 01:51:56,091
purpose,
you know,

2886
01:51:56,091 --> 01:51:59,480
to put energy in to other humans and to
watch them flourish and grow.

2887
01:51:59,481 --> 01:52:01,430
And get better.
And that's a feedback for me.

2888
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,710
It's obvious.
It might be just doing it for myself,

2889
01:52:03,711 --> 01:52:05,880
but it's a good service back first.
But yeah,

2890
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:08,390
I lived to see people do good.
Well I'm glad you're around dude.

2891
01:52:08,391 --> 01:52:09,860
Cause it makes me sad.
It makes it interesting.

2892
01:52:09,861 --> 01:52:12,780
And this is such a suck,
a fucking exciting time for MMA.

2893
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:14,810
Match is so much good.
Shit is going on.

2894
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,170
Life is you.
You love and doing that show though,

2895
01:52:17,171 --> 01:52:18,004
the mma show

2896
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:21,120
last time yet though,
I heard you.

2897
01:52:21,121 --> 01:52:24,150
When I'm on a broadcasting,
uh,

2898
01:52:24,151 --> 01:52:26,490
you're talking about the different
levels of knocked down.

2899
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:29,330
Right.
And we had herb Dean and big John

2900
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:30,900
McCarthy,
Joe McCarthy was talking about the five

2901
01:52:30,901 --> 01:52:32,760
levels of a nug down.
You know,

2902
01:52:32,761 --> 01:52:34,740
once you start staggering when she full
back,

2903
01:52:34,741 --> 01:52:36,810
when she crawled away,
there's all different sites,

2904
01:52:36,811 --> 01:52:37,740
you know,
and I think that,

2905
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:40,230
I love those compensation,
you know,

2906
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,690
the round table,
sit down with some professionals and

2907
01:52:42,691 --> 01:52:45,740
talk about problems that we have right
now and then figuring it out.

2908
01:52:45,741 --> 01:52:46,210
And I

2909
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:47,330
love that.
And the show all,

2910
01:52:47,331 --> 01:52:50,450
she was great that she knew talent when
I called them mcgregor in the beginning

2911
01:52:50,451 --> 01:52:51,980
we had him on,
you know,

2912
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:56,390
so we see these guys come on the show,
but also once a while we guys are Mark

2913
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:57,890
Coleman or you know,
or don fry.

2914
01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:59,630
You know,
I see my old buddies again.

2915
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:01,590
It's,
it's just a fun show pass.

2916
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,920
Before you got here,
we were talking about Ipos and we showed

2917
01:53:03,921 --> 01:53:06,290
the Fabricio Werdum Travis Brown.
I poked.

2918
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:07,400
Did you see that?
Have you seen it?

2919
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:08,151
Yeah,
I heard about it.

2920
01:53:08,151 --> 01:53:09,170
Yeah.
Fucking crazy.

2921
01:53:09,171 --> 01:53:13,550
Like knuckle deep into different ratios.
I what do you think could help that?

2922
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:16,250
What do you think could fix that?
I think penalties.

2923
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,770
I truly believe so because if you look
at pancreas,

2924
01:53:18,771 --> 01:53:21,440
which was open and striking,
we never stabbed each other in the eye.

2925
01:53:21,810 --> 01:53:24,470
[inaudible] how is that even possible?
Right.

2926
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:28,100
So now because we are cha hands
backwards because we want to hit with

2927
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:30,590
the palm and,
and it's just a fact when it happens,

2928
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:33,170
it won't happen in training.
Right.

2929
01:53:33,171 --> 01:53:33,710
And,
and,

2930
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:35,600
and especially not at that cap.
Oh No,

2931
01:53:35,601 --> 01:53:37,000
not anymore.
Of course we've got a,

2932
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:38,630
if they come from Greg Jackson winkle,
John,

2933
01:53:38,631 --> 01:53:40,760
I would say,
well my Greg John lost an eye,

2934
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,290
you know,
and uh,

2935
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,550
w with a neil it wetter as it was a foot
neil.

2936
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:45,510
Okay.
Tonio but,

2937
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:46,580
but still,
you know,

2938
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:49,890
pads for some money holding paths.
That's what happens.

2939
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:50,810
Very dangerous.
Yeah.

2940
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:52,430
No,
but I think once you say,

2941
01:53:52,431 --> 01:53:55,430
listen,
if you're known to do that,

2942
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:57,620
uh,
did it happened with you in the past?

2943
01:53:57,650 --> 01:53:59,660
Referee should be allowed to go before
there.

2944
01:53:59,661 --> 01:54:00,230
He say,
listen,

2945
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:01,760
when I poke I'm going to give you a red
card.

2946
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:04,880
And I think that will,
that will stop it because people are

2947
01:54:04,881 --> 01:54:06,830
going to get more,
become more careful.

2948
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:09,400
We Red card,
which in pride with costs you a 10% of

2949
01:54:09,401 --> 01:54:10,840
year,
10% perse.

2950
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:14,840
I think the point deduction,
I think one point every time I think,

2951
01:54:14,841 --> 01:54:15,321
uh,
you know,

2952
01:54:15,321 --> 01:54:17,780
no warnings for an ipod because you
take,

2953
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:20,120
I think the gloves too.
But I think that if you,

2954
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:22,370
even if you take a point away from a
guy,

2955
01:54:22,371 --> 01:54:27,371
like if you warn them like that person
you poked in the eye is still damaged by

2956
01:54:27,951 --> 01:54:30,380
that.
And so even if he says it's an accident,

2957
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:32,160
like it doesn't matter one point either
way,

2958
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:33,710
even though it's an accident.
What I'm saying,

2959
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:37,430
even if it's obviously an accident,
if your fingers go in someone's eye and

2960
01:54:37,431 --> 01:54:39,920
you know it's going to cause a point,
everyone is going to curl their knuckles

2961
01:54:39,921 --> 01:54:41,570
back even more accountable for it.
Yeah.

2962
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:42,890
Yes sir.
I see that.

2963
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:43,880
Yes.
The gloves,

2964
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:46,050
gloves and a penalties or a beating.

2965
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:51,380
I hate to believe anybody's doing it on
purpose,

2966
01:54:51,381 --> 01:54:56,210
but someone must be doing it on purpose.
Some I feel are kind of aware of that.

2967
01:54:56,211 --> 01:54:58,190
There are some tactics for sure.
You know,

2968
01:54:58,191 --> 01:54:59,840
does,
I mean how often is that happening in

2969
01:54:59,841 --> 01:55:00,710
training?
I don't know,

2970
01:55:00,711 --> 01:55:02,030
but uh,
it's,

2971
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:05,510
some of them do look deliberate.
It's that kicks into pills.

2972
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:09,380
Crystal Sisinsky what's one time
fighting and he got kicked six times,

2973
01:55:09,381 --> 01:55:10,640
I believe.
It might even be seven.

2974
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:12,620
And it feels,
and he goes back to the colon or the

2975
01:55:12,621 --> 01:55:16,430
balls.
Liz and I go kick him back.

2976
01:55:16,510 --> 01:55:17,900
Yeah,
that's my answer.

2977
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:21,290
I said he's not getting a warning,
so do it back then.

2978
01:55:21,291 --> 01:55:23,870
He knows how it feels and it hopefully
he's going to stop.

2979
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:26,510
But Chris of is too nice of a guy.
He didn't do it.

2980
01:55:27,050 --> 01:55:28,580
There's a few fights where you go,
Ooh,

2981
01:55:28,581 --> 01:55:29,560
I got to wonder why not.

2982
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:31,610
If that's purpose on purpose rather.
Um,

2983
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:33,860
did you see a check Congo versus Cro
cop?

2984
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:36,650
Oh yeah.
Waylay them in the sack.

2985
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,840
Wham.
Like more than once.

2986
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:41,510
I mean it was several,
several good blows.

2987
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:45,420
Most of the time it's bad technique most
of the times with the lead leg and they

2988
01:55:45,421 --> 01:55:48,210
don't step open to right foot.
So the angle cannot go,

2989
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:50,430
uh,
like a 90 degree angle into the muscle

2990
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,050
and it gets straight up.
It'd be,

2991
01:55:52,051 --> 01:55:52,530
she goes,
look,

2992
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:53,820
look,
if everybody who gets kicked to the

2993
01:55:53,821 --> 01:55:55,500
pills,
I guarantee you the leg that they're

2994
01:55:55,501 --> 01:55:57,870
standing on the toes are pointing
forward.

2995
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,910
If they will point to decide,
it will be okay.

2996
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:02,880
Well with check.
I believe it was knees in the clinch.

2997
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,140
Oh,
it was,

2998
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:06,510
I think it was just right.
Yeah.

2999
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:09,740
A Thai boxer shoot noted.
I never need anybody to build.

3000
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:11,820
I did once actually,
but that was on purpose.

3001
01:56:13,430 --> 01:56:14,720
I guess renee,
Rosie,

3002
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:18,270
I,
if I could fight video from that,

3003
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:21,000
that is the best dealer.
So I fight where they,

3004
01:56:21,001 --> 01:56:21,990
Rosie,
you heard about that,

3005
01:56:21,991 --> 01:56:23,400
right?
The tall guy from all a total

3006
01:56:23,401 --> 01:56:24,300
psychopath,
they say.

3007
01:56:24,710 --> 01:56:27,600
And it does always illegal things.
So we're fighting him and I'm the first

3008
01:56:27,601 --> 01:56:29,160
ride.
I beat the crap out of him in a second

3009
01:56:29,161 --> 01:56:33,180
ride would come out and be a clinching
and he bites in my ear and I'm shouting,

3010
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:34,590
let go,
let go,

3011
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:37,110
let go.
And then you see my knee going all the

3012
01:56:37,111 --> 01:56:38,670
way back.
Then I need him.

3013
01:56:38,910 --> 01:56:41,550
He comes loose from the ground.
That's how I knew him in the bill.

3014
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:44,520
He goes down and I wanted to attack him
on the ground,

3015
01:56:44,521 --> 01:56:47,850
but they pulled me off and then a core
habits was in my corner.

3016
01:56:47,851 --> 01:56:49,720
Now he brought all his friends who was
like,

3017
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,660
he had hell's angels with him.
And,

3018
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:54,600
and I had all,
my boss was friends with me and they all

3019
01:56:54,601 --> 01:56:55,890
started fighting.
They throw us,

3020
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:59,640
they threw a chair into the ring.
If bounce off core hammers says beck at

3021
01:56:59,641 --> 01:57:01,710
leds behind me.
If you see the video,

3022
01:57:01,711 --> 01:57:03,000
man,
it leds behind me.

3023
01:57:03,001 --> 01:57:04,620
I looked behind me,
I see the chair,

3024
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:07,560
I sit in the chair while I watched
everybody.

3025
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:13,020
And that later they cleared everybody.
Everybody's throw it down because the

3026
01:57:13,021 --> 01:57:14,220
referee took,
he says,

3027
01:57:14,221 --> 01:57:15,090
why did you do it?
And I said,

3028
01:57:15,091 --> 01:57:17,430
look at my ear.
And it was a hole straight through my

3029
01:57:17,431 --> 01:57:18,840
air.
He bit straight through my year,

3030
01:57:18,841 --> 01:57:21,090
a holding there.
And then he grabbed a microphone and he

3031
01:57:21,091 --> 01:57:22,860
announced to everybody and other,
Whoa,

3032
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:24,420
he's got a hole in his ear.
He bit his ear.

3033
01:57:24,421 --> 01:57:26,070
That's why he did it.
And then everybody calm down.

3034
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:28,550
Oh Wow.
And did you continue to fight right?

3035
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:29,421
No.
No,

3036
01:57:29,421 --> 01:57:30,300
no.
That wasn't it.

3037
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:35,080
It was a hard knee.
Wow.

3038
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:36,050
The wild,
wild west.

3039
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:38,930
It was a good one.
Eddie Bravo thinks he should be able to

3040
01:57:38,931 --> 01:57:42,050
hit a guy in the back of the head.
He thinks that when you take a guy's

3041
01:57:42,051 --> 01:57:45,350
back,
when the old days of mma,

3042
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:47,990
when a guy had two hooks in,
you almost didn't go to the rear naked

3043
01:57:47,991 --> 01:57:49,640
choke.
He just blasted guy in the back of the

3044
01:57:49,641 --> 01:57:50,930
head with the elbows.
Yeah,

3045
01:57:50,931 --> 01:57:53,090
that's right.
But here we go again before rules.

3046
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:56,150
Right.
Hands on.

3047
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:59,750
It was and so and yeah.
What's his name

3048
01:58:01,850 --> 01:58:03,770
from Holland?
Like a sinker.

3049
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,880
Yeah.
Judo Guy told me that guy was fucking

3050
01:58:07,881 --> 01:58:10,490
with Enzo.
Could call in his room calling his hotel

3051
01:58:10,491 --> 01:58:11,680
room all night.
So hands.

3052
01:58:11,681 --> 01:58:12,291
I was like,
oh,

3053
01:58:12,291 --> 01:58:13,530
okay.
All right.

3054
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:15,770
And did you see what he stepped on his
face at the end?

3055
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:17,540
Stepped on his face after he smashed
him.

3056
01:58:19,310 --> 01:58:21,050
That's what guys would do.
They would take someone's back.

3057
01:58:21,070 --> 01:58:23,390
Remember Health Gracie fought somebody,
I forget who it was,

3058
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:27,470
but he got the hooks in and just boom,
boom,

3059
01:58:27,471 --> 01:58:30,330
boom.
Right to the base of the skull and like,

3060
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,860
it's so affective though.
I know.

3061
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:36,500
I do the same thing and keeps your spine
impact right.

3062
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:38,540
Here it is.
Here's Hanzo.

3063
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:39,433
Oh,
nice.

3064
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:40,221
Oh,
this is,

3065
01:58:40,221 --> 01:58:42,400
this is a actually,
okay,

3066
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:44,080
look at that cage.
Yeah.

3067
01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:46,660
Duct tape around it and so he gets his
bags.

3068
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:48,610
He flattens them out and then here it
comes.

3069
01:58:48,611 --> 01:58:49,690
Boom,
boom,

3070
01:58:49,691 --> 01:58:50,830
boom,
boom.

3071
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:52,900
Go to baby.
Yeah.

3072
01:58:52,901 --> 01:58:56,320
I mean data is the way to open up that
choke man.

3073
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:58,270
You can't defend once someone starts
raining,

3074
01:58:58,271 --> 01:59:01,230
those elbows down and you know you can
cover that shit up all you want.

3075
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:02,230
Now he's tapping.
No,

3076
01:59:02,231 --> 01:59:02,950
watch this.

3077
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:04,810
Where did you go to wait,
what he's going to do.

3078
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:06,730
He gets kicked.
It gets up.

3079
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:08,210
It looks steps.
That's right.

3080
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:14,120
That's my head
world combat champion.

3081
01:59:14,590 --> 01:59:15,840
That was,
I think the state.

3082
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:17,020
Look at it.
He helps him up.

3083
01:59:17,050 --> 01:59:18,940
Hey,
roll over on his head.

3084
01:59:18,941 --> 01:59:20,460
We're pals now.
People as well.

3085
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:23,230
Yeah.
He beat the fuck out of that dude was a

3086
01:59:23,231 --> 01:59:25,900
good one.
That was I think the same event where

3087
01:59:25,901 --> 01:59:29,530
Marillo bustamonte fought Tom Erickson
and they fought.

3088
01:59:30,070 --> 01:59:33,700
They fought for like fucking 90 minutes.
It was one of those crazy fight.

3089
01:59:33,701 --> 01:59:35,290
It was like a 45 minute fight.
I think it was.

3090
01:59:35,291 --> 01:59:37,630
Honestly,
it was a crazy fight because they didn't

3091
01:59:37,631 --> 01:59:40,000
have like an ending to those things.
They didn't,

3092
01:59:40,001 --> 01:59:42,580
you know,
he just fought 90 minutes for suck up at

3093
01:59:42,581 --> 01:59:45,170
Hawaii
drowns.

3094
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:47,650
They did rounds.
I don't think Marillo in Erickson did

3095
01:59:47,651 --> 01:59:49,100
rounds.
I think it was just one long er,

3096
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:49,983
I don't remember.

3097
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:52,360
But I remember like Ericsson at the
time,

3098
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:56,320
he's like the forgotten heavyweight.
Like when he was in his prime,

3099
01:59:56,321 --> 02:00:01,321
he was fucking terrifying cause he was a
natural 300 pound go real low and

3100
02:00:02,990 --> 02:00:06,160
enormous wrestler and he could hit so
fucking hard.

3101
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,110
I remember he knocked out Kevin
Randleman,

3102
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:10,600
he hit Kevin random and we're like,
oh left hook and knocked him out.

3103
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:14,290
But it was like Jesus Christ,
he was one of the scariest guys for his

3104
02:00:14,291 --> 02:00:16,600
time,
but just like kind of missed the window,

3105
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:19,870
you know,
like he was really scary in the early

3106
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:23,470
days of MMA.
Nobody wanted to fight him a month ago.

3107
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:26,110
Super tough man.
What a great guy.

3108
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:31,160
And we tell him,
Matt Lindland like nothing happened.

3109
02:00:31,331 --> 02:00:33,820
I didn't tap.
And they believe that a big John

3110
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,270
talked about that on our show.
He said,

3111
02:00:37,271 --> 02:00:37,851
yeah,
that,

3112
02:00:37,851 --> 02:00:39,960
that was a bad one for me because you
know,

3113
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:41,073
I didn't see it.

3114
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:43,720
And that's what people should understand
at home.

3115
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:44,760
You know,
dee dee,

3116
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,840
same as the referees,
especially with Dina and big John just

3117
02:00:48,841 --> 02:00:50,890
show invested.
They loved the sports so much.

3118
02:00:50,891 --> 02:00:53,650
There's so much,
therefore the foot of fighters,

3119
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:57,340
so when they make a bad call,
it hurts them as well,

3120
02:00:57,341 --> 02:00:59,080
you know?
But then to get the avalanche,

3121
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:01,420
avalanche of older people on the
Internet,

3122
02:01:01,421 --> 02:01:02,050
you know,
come on,

3123
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:04,420
everybody's human.
And people were talking about I believe

3124
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:07,780
four Colt or three Kohl's that they were
talking about.

3125
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,910
Uh,
her with herb dean,

3126
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:12,100
Herb Dean had over seven and a half
thousand matches.

3127
02:01:12,101 --> 02:01:12,701
He did.
I go,

3128
02:01:12,701 --> 02:01:15,950
I do all sound great.
I like those off cody for mistakes in

3129
02:01:15,951 --> 02:01:18,580
seven and a half thousand matches.
You're doing a good job of both of those

3130
02:01:18,581 --> 02:01:21,520
guys are the gold standard and John
McCarthy,

3131
02:01:21,521 --> 02:01:23,170
that's the gold standard.
Everybody,

3132
02:01:23,171 --> 02:01:24,820
I mean,
you know who was really good before he

3133
02:01:24,821 --> 02:01:25,870
went away for selling weed.

3134
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:28,330
Josh Rosen,
he did my last fight.

3135
02:01:28,331 --> 02:01:30,400
He's very good.
Very good.

3136
02:01:30,401 --> 02:01:31,950
Crazy.
Went away for something like that.

3137
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:32,920
So crazy.
Well,

3138
02:01:32,921 --> 02:01:35,320
you want to wait for selling weed,
and he had a kind of little bit of an

3139
02:01:35,321 --> 02:01:37,880
arsenal,
legal Rahama,

3140
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:44,270
a little only 12 acres of wheat.
They will have nothing wrong with that.

3141
02:01:44,350 --> 02:01:48,560
It's just helping the world and the real
problem was I believe guns were involved

3142
02:01:48,561 --> 02:01:49,700
and that's a,
that's when things,

3143
02:01:49,701 --> 02:01:50,271
but yeah,
look,

3144
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:52,820
you're going to sell weed illegal.
You've got to be their protected.

3145
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:55,190
It's unfortunate.
The whole thing is unfortunate,

3146
02:01:55,191 --> 02:01:57,380
but he was a very good referee.
Yup.

3147
02:01:57,470 --> 02:01:59,360
Very good referee.
Very good martial artist too.

3148
02:01:59,620 --> 02:02:01,310
Yeah.
He always tried and I sat and I respect

3149
02:02:01,311 --> 02:02:04,340
that obviously to having people in the
field who if you're going to work in the

3150
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:05,860
field,
he should actually train in the fields.

3151
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:06,740
You should have just gone one day.

3152
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:09,980
I to bring up to you,
what did you think about the Travis

3153
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:10,470
Browne?
Fabrizio Breeshia.

3154
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:12,920
We're doing five where we're travis
called time.

3155
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:16,960
He got his finger jammed for Breeshia,
threw a punch and travis is,

3156
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:20,960
travis has finger apparently broke and
there's some photos of it now online.

3157
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:22,610
It was,
it's fucking nasty.

3158
02:02:22,611 --> 02:02:27,380
Like shows you how tough travis is that
he continued with his finger was smashed

3159
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:30,650
and it was a compound fracture with the
bone broke through the skin.

3160
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:33,170
That's one picture,
but there's some even better ones that

3161
02:02:33,171 --> 02:02:34,340
he released today.
Well,

3162
02:02:34,341 --> 02:02:35,430
you could see it,
uh,

3163
02:02:35,431 --> 02:02:38,090
after the fight.
It was a nasty break,

3164
02:02:38,091 --> 02:02:42,410
but so it was a weird thing where
[inaudible] through this punch and he

3165
02:02:42,411 --> 02:02:46,130
threw like one of those chocolate dell
style over hands that come over the top

3166
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:50,330
and it landed on the fingers of Travis
and snapped one of his finger.

3167
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:53,780
So Travis calls time,
which you really can't do.

3168
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:54,930
He's like,
my fingers fucked up.

3169
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:56,950
He calls time like,
wow,

3170
02:02:57,050 --> 02:02:58,370
scroll up though.
And you see it.

3171
02:02:58,371 --> 02:02:59,480
The actual opening.
Yeah.

3172
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:01,940
Here comes the boom.
He says timeout.

3173
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,540
Right.
Given James said he cannot do that.

3174
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:07,430
I Guess Marie Smith,
did they stop?

3175
02:03:07,650 --> 02:03:09,740
Did they go ahead and give me time?
Sorry.

3176
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:11,240
Oh,
that's right.

3177
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:13,370
You did that boss.
You did that in a fight.

3178
02:03:13,530 --> 02:03:14,363
Yeah,
yeah,

3179
02:03:14,490 --> 02:03:15,560
yeah.
But Maurice,

3180
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:17,480
no,
I d I liked that.

3181
02:03:17,481 --> 02:03:19,730
Yeah.
I kicked him in the head and then I got

3182
02:03:19,731 --> 02:03:21,440
excited and wanted to give him another
kick in the head,

3183
02:03:21,441 --> 02:03:24,470
but I slip and a fall and to go out.
Then Maurice wants to jump on top of me

3184
02:03:24,471 --> 02:03:25,490
and I put my head up.
I say,

3185
02:03:25,491 --> 02:03:28,520
wait,
and he stops and I'm getting up and I

3186
02:03:28,521 --> 02:03:29,390
go,
thank you.

3187
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:35,280
That's good closure
trick and another one to help fetty

3188
02:03:35,541 --> 02:03:39,920
funny anybody
with the Jason to Lucia.

3189
02:03:39,950 --> 02:03:41,300
I dropped it with his liver shot,
right?

3190
02:03:41,301 --> 02:03:45,170
And then I walked over to him.
You see what I'm doing as stretch my arm

3191
02:03:45,171 --> 02:03:50,171
above me and I wave with my head and you
see him look it up to my head and then I

3192
02:03:50,211 --> 02:03:54,020
live or kick him again.
I just put my hand up and say,

3193
02:03:54,021 --> 02:03:54,854
yeah,
look at this.

3194
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:58,070
He actually looked there.
That's good composure,

3195
02:03:58,071 --> 02:03:59,600
right?
We actually use that stuff all the time.

3196
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:00,463
The bird,
the bird,

3197
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:03,180
so there's mastercard

3198
02:04:03,810 --> 02:04:05,940
sutong.
He's my first striking coach.

3199
02:04:05,941 --> 02:04:08,670
Had an Alpha male and a.
When dwayne first started coming to

3200
02:04:08,671 --> 02:04:12,120
teach at a alpha male,
I was thinking was my second fight.

3201
02:04:12,121 --> 02:04:14,250
You were there.
We were in San Jose against a Hugo

3202
02:04:14,251 --> 02:04:17,460
vianna and uh,
we're in the hotel room day of the

3203
02:04:17,461 --> 02:04:18,810
fight,
just kind of hanging out,

3204
02:04:18,811 --> 02:04:21,840
just waiting and mastered tongs just in
the bed.

3205
02:04:21,841 --> 02:04:23,190
He sleeps all day long.
And then,

3206
02:04:23,191 --> 02:04:24,450
uh,
he's in the bed just hanging out.

3207
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:27,330
My dwayne comes to hang out with us and
he's telling master,

3208
02:04:27,331 --> 02:04:29,220
telling the story.
Am I strong as I kind of like looking at

3209
02:04:29,221 --> 02:04:31,650
him like he's paying attention but then
it looks at Dwayne.

3210
02:04:31,651 --> 02:04:34,170
He goes bird and weren't at a hotel
room.

3211
02:04:34,171 --> 02:04:35,420
Right.
And doing like it looks over and look if

3212
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:38,010
there's a bird and as Dwayne back to
start talking to him

3213
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,900
again,
he's rolled over on the bed and looking

3214
02:04:39,901 --> 02:04:41,360
at the direction night and then
sleeping.

3215
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:47,130
Look over there while I turn over and go
to sleep cause I deal with the barrage

3216
02:04:47,131 --> 02:04:50,100
of the,
of the Ludwig I talking fast and doesn't

3217
02:04:50,101 --> 02:04:53,610
understand it.
So he turns around the fucking guy.

3218
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:56,040
He was supposed to corner Tj in that
fight.

3219
02:04:56,041 --> 02:04:57,120
She said,
what's that?

3220
02:04:57,150 --> 02:04:59,880
He was supposed to courtney you on that
fight and we couldn't find the fucking

3221
02:04:59,881 --> 02:05:01,100
guy,
uh,

3222
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:04,620
about to walk out for my fight.
And Master town's nowhere to be found.

3223
02:05:04,621 --> 02:05:05,311
I'm like,
what the hell?

3224
02:05:05,311 --> 02:05:07,530
I'm going out to my fight.
Where's the master Tong and in,

3225
02:05:07,531 --> 02:05:09,990
so danny just corners me and after the
fight I get back.

3226
02:05:09,991 --> 02:05:10,824
You messed up.
I was like,

3227
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:11,641
oh,
tj.

3228
02:05:11,641 --> 02:05:14,670
Uh,
I go smoke way up in the rafters.

3229
02:05:14,671 --> 02:05:16,320
So supposedly he says he went up into
the rafters,

3230
02:05:16,321 --> 02:05:19,590
this smoke his cigarette and he was too
scared to get down so he couldn't come

3231
02:05:19,591 --> 02:05:21,090
down to come corner.
That's a great reason.

3232
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,000
I'm in the room like the next day and I
go say,

3233
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:25,551
well,
don't wake,

3234
02:05:25,551 --> 02:05:30,180
what the fuck were you ties and
cigarettes or gambling or everything?

3235
02:05:30,181 --> 02:05:31,570
I don't know.
It's just so cold.

3236
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:33,360
Good fighters.
Yeah,

3237
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:35,910
that smoked cigarettes.
He was smoking while he's fine.

3238
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:37,560
I mean,
that guy is so talented.

3239
02:05:37,561 --> 02:05:38,580
It's crazy.
I wish she,

3240
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:40,800
if he had half the work ethic,
that Dwayne head,

3241
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:42,240
he'd be amazing.
You know,

3242
02:05:42,241 --> 02:05:43,770
he,
he's such a good trainer.

3243
02:05:43,771 --> 02:05:46,500
He's such a good fighter by justice.
I Dunno man.

3244
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:49,500
He's such a freak though.
Would see him in the corner with a tank

3245
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:52,510
top on and the gold,
bunnings and sunglasses.

3246
02:05:52,511 --> 02:05:53,590
Loving light side.
Yeah.

3247
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:55,830
Big smiles on face.
Suns out.

3248
02:05:55,831 --> 02:05:57,260
Guns out.
Yeah.

3249
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,920
Yeah.
Big Ass belt buckle.

3250
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:04,380
And he would make sure to be in the
camera for the decisions.

3251
02:06:04,381 --> 02:06:08,010
He's like position himself so you can
see him like he wants to be a superstar,

3252
02:06:08,011 --> 02:06:09,630
you know.
Isn't there like an issue with him

3253
02:06:09,631 --> 02:06:12,930
gambling against one of your fighters
against her favor?

3254
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:14,340
Apparently so.
No,

3255
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:15,210
no,
not [inaudible].

3256
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:16,120
This is from the hills

3257
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:21,740
Barao in New Jersey.
It was both.

3258
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:25,070
It was me and Tom and I,
and no one knows if this actually

3259
02:06:25,071 --> 02:06:25,701
happened,
right.

3260
02:06:25,701 --> 02:06:26,534
But uh,

3261
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:29,760
allegedly

3262
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:34,030
he gambled on borow to beat Faber and
he's cornering faber.

3263
02:06:34,330 --> 02:06:37,420
Like what the fuck man.
I go to New Jersey at the corner of my

3264
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:39,180
eye.
I do two seminars.

3265
02:06:39,450 --> 02:06:40,620
They,
I get up super early,

3266
02:06:40,621 --> 02:06:43,420
do two seminars before his fight,
come back if I do everything I need to

3267
02:06:43,421 --> 02:06:45,330
do.
And then after the fights,

3268
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:47,280
uh,
which apparently he gambled against

3269
02:06:47,281 --> 02:06:49,140
favor.
I'm leaving the hotel to go,

3270
02:06:49,141 --> 02:06:51,300
I got to get up super early and take off
to go back home and,

3271
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:53,550
and I'm,
and I'm walking out down the hall and

3272
02:06:53,551 --> 02:06:56,880
he's got a track record of hitting
people up for money all the time,

3273
02:06:56,881 --> 02:06:59,090
tongue and uh,
easy an addict.

3274
02:06:59,450 --> 02:07:03,300
He legitimately apparently has a problem
gambling and not budgeting his shit.

3275
02:07:03,301 --> 02:07:04,590
Right.
So anyway,

3276
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:06,630
I fly to vague or flight to a New
Jersey,

3277
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:08,430
do two seminars,
corner.

3278
02:07:08,431 --> 02:07:09,930
Like I'm just,
I'm working my ass off.

3279
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:13,050
I'm leaving the hotel after the fight
now and the next morning and he's

3280
02:07:13,051 --> 02:07:14,610
following me down the hotel it,
oh,

3281
02:07:14,611 --> 02:07:15,444
Dwayne,
Dwayne,

3282
02:07:15,570 --> 02:07:16,403
uh,
uh,

3283
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:17,503
uh,
uh,

3284
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:19,290
can I have a little bit of money and I'm
like,

3285
02:07:19,670 --> 02:07:21,450
and then I like I gave him the Cro cop
stare.

3286
02:07:21,451 --> 02:07:23,490
I was like,
no,

3287
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:24,950
motherfucker.
I got up early,

3288
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:28,140
came out here and work my ass off to
seminars cornered and do what I needed

3289
02:07:28,141 --> 02:07:30,660
to do while you were sleeping in.
Don't ask me for money,

3290
02:07:30,661 --> 02:07:33,110
motherfucker.
Like I got genuinely mad cause he's just

3291
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,560
being lazy ass and asking me for.
So,

3292
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:36,400
um,

3293
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:39,160
I told him no,
it's like that pool when he says you're

3294
02:07:39,161 --> 02:07:40,660
the world's worst best friend,
you know,

3295
02:07:40,661 --> 02:07:43,210
he put it when you bet against him at
the deadpool,

3296
02:07:44,990 --> 02:07:47,560
but on the positive side master,
Tom's a bad ass.

3297
02:07:48,050 --> 02:07:50,710
So bad man.
He's such a talented dude.

3298
02:07:50,711 --> 02:07:51,730
Yeah,
I know.

3299
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:53,560
It's,
I think he is one of the best guys in

3300
02:07:53,561 --> 02:07:54,390
the world.
The holding mitts.

3301
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:56,590
Yeah.
I wouldn't say he's like super

3302
02:07:56,591 --> 02:08:00,040
structured and going to like,
maybe it's like his understanding of

3303
02:08:00,041 --> 02:08:00,581
English,
you know,

3304
02:08:00,581 --> 02:08:02,890
you can't like break something down.
Like this is why you should do it and

3305
02:08:02,891 --> 02:08:05,560
tell me like why I'm doing things and
when to do it.

3306
02:08:05,561 --> 02:08:08,320
And he just kind of shows you,
he makes you do it on the mits without

3307
02:08:08,321 --> 02:08:10,480
even you knowing it.
He makes you do things you're supposed

3308
02:08:10,481 --> 02:08:13,500
to do the right way just by holding him
and having a very limited,

3309
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:14,730
limited vocabulary.

3310
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:15,820
TJ A lot.
Oh,

3311
02:08:15,821 --> 02:08:18,790
here's my first trainer and I,
I picked up on a stand up very quick

3312
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:21,130
with him and I think he's a great
trainer.

3313
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:24,180
He's just an addict.
I just got nasty Moitai tall dude.

3314
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:25,033
He's so,
yeah,

3315
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:26,830
very good tie.
And He's good.

3316
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:27,933
I love the guy,
man.

3317
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,490
It's a problem.
And when people would get that gambling

3318
02:08:30,491 --> 02:08:31,880
bug,
that's a scary book.

3319
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:35,080
That's the first Korea.
I never did a good bug.

3320
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:37,180
I mean if you got a trainer,
this betting against you,

3321
02:08:37,181 --> 02:08:42,181
I'm as bad as it gets confirmed though.
So master talking was coaching out in

3322
02:08:42,821 --> 02:08:44,800
Texas.
He's at a gym in Texas and that's when

3323
02:08:44,801 --> 02:08:45,820
this,
when Dwayne first got here,

3324
02:08:45,821 --> 02:08:48,620
so masterone was kind of with her.
I'm kind of mad and just kind of laughed

3325
02:08:48,621 --> 02:08:49,960
and that's why we needed a new coach,
you know,

3326
02:08:49,961 --> 02:08:50,950
that's why I brought Duane in.

3327
02:08:51,310 --> 02:08:55,180
And then when favor was going to fight,
Braley brought it back for eight weeks

3328
02:08:55,181 --> 02:08:57,250
for his camp and he's out here training
him.

3329
02:08:58,210 --> 02:08:59,310
Favorite went in that fight with the
herd.

3330
02:08:59,311 --> 02:09:00,820
Hamstring and message.
Chung knew that as well.

3331
02:09:00,821 --> 02:09:02,590
Like he tore his hamstring a little bit
and went into the fight,

3332
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:05,230
little injured.
And so when my strong went back to

3333
02:09:05,231 --> 02:09:07,540
Texas,
he was bragging that he made $5,000

3334
02:09:07,541 --> 02:09:10,660
cause you bet all this money that favor
wasn't going to win the fight and then

3335
02:09:10,661 --> 02:09:13,780
it got back to favor because favor new
the the trainer out in Texas.

3336
02:09:13,781 --> 02:09:16,840
And so it came back to when we found out
about it and you know,

3337
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:20,020
allegedly who knows if it's really true,
but message was bragging about it,

3338
02:09:20,021 --> 02:09:20,854
you know,
that hurts.

3339
02:09:20,930 --> 02:09:22,490
Well that's awesome guy.
Yeah,

3340
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:24,040
you love him.
I mean I love the guy,

3341
02:09:24,041 --> 02:09:25,120
you know,
and if I would come to find out,

3342
02:09:25,121 --> 02:09:26,080
he bet against you.
That's,

3343
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,840
that's rough.
You know what if we gave you four

3344
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:33,160
one five and give you four but like
that's what he's supposed to do.

3345
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:35,140
Listen dog,
you know,

3346
02:09:35,141 --> 02:09:37,300
and I know that you came into that fight
a little fucked up.

3347
02:09:37,301 --> 02:09:39,720
So like here's a taste.
No,

3348
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:41,600
given the majority of it,
right?

3349
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:44,810
Not even half most of it,
but he still won 1000 bucks.

3350
02:09:44,850 --> 02:09:46,900
People Gamble,
product problem.

3351
02:09:46,901 --> 02:09:47,734
Don't do that.
I know.

3352
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:52,180
Cause he had nothing to show for it
afterwards.

3353
02:09:52,181 --> 02:09:54,280
He guarantee went and gambled it
somewhere else.

3354
02:09:54,990 --> 02:09:55,823
I mean,
he,

3355
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:58,120
when he was coaching it off from in the
beginning before it ain't got there.

3356
02:09:58,121 --> 02:09:59,110
I mean,
he's making good money,

3357
02:09:59,111 --> 02:09:59,944
you know?
I know he's,

3358
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:03,730
he supports his family and stuff,
but he should have had been a lot more

3359
02:10:03,731 --> 02:10:04,660
well off than he was,
you know?

3360
02:10:04,661 --> 02:10:05,880
But he's in a,
it's an addict.

3361
02:10:05,881 --> 02:10:06,940
It's a serious problem,
man.

3362
02:10:06,941 --> 02:10:10,000
It's like you wouldn't have actually
think that it's probably,

3363
02:10:10,001 --> 02:10:11,080
it's,
it's a serious problem.

3364
02:10:11,081 --> 02:10:12,940
Goes back what I was telling my guys I'm
doing for myself.

3365
02:10:12,941 --> 02:10:14,920
You're going to create habits.
Let them be good habits and I got that

3366
02:10:14,921 --> 02:10:16,480
from Sensei.
Pretty good habits,

3367
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:17,200
right?
Yeah.

3368
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:21,340
Your habit is train like a motherfucker
and teach like a motherfucker and get

3369
02:10:21,341 --> 02:10:23,920
obsessed with that.
I don't get obsessed with Black Jack.

3370
02:10:24,410 --> 02:10:27,990
I invest in other humans.
It's,

3371
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,790
it's weird once you gamble because you
need it.

3372
02:10:30,820 --> 02:10:33,800
You always lose trust.
I enjoy gambling fights.

3373
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:34,220
I used

3374
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:36,290
to do it all the time.
When I first started working for the

3375
02:10:36,291 --> 02:10:38,420
UFC,
I would gamble on fights and then I was

3376
02:10:38,421 --> 02:10:39,770
like,
can I get in trouble for this?

3377
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:41,540
I was like,
I wasn't sure.

3378
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:42,380
I was like,
I'm not,

3379
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:43,610
can't affect the outcome.

3380
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:46,150
You should.
You should mention it before to fight.

3381
02:10:46,151 --> 02:10:46,984
You say,
I put my

3382
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:49,720
money,
I'm taking more enticing.

3383
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:52,600
People get mad at me though.
Who the fuck bro?

3384
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:54,520
Right.
Yeah,

3385
02:10:54,521 --> 02:10:59,521
but what the fuck bro?
The best is one of the time when Diego

3386
02:10:59,570 --> 02:11:03,340
see you dig,
oh Sanchez when a fight and then at the

3387
02:11:03,341 --> 02:11:04,570
time here you're going to interview him.
He's like,

3388
02:11:04,571 --> 02:11:06,010
Hey,
you told me all this weird before and

3389
02:11:06,011 --> 02:11:06,850
you're like,
yeah,

3390
02:11:06,851 --> 02:11:07,720
you're weird.
And then he was like,

3391
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,090
just got quiet because he tried to call
you out,

3392
02:11:10,091 --> 02:11:10,670
but you're like,
yeah,

3393
02:11:10,670 --> 02:11:14,390
that's a bad thing.
Fuck.

3394
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:18,130
Have I seen this view before?
He fought Joe Lowe's on and you will see

3395
02:11:18,131 --> 02:11:22,690
200 he was doing an interview before Joe
Lozan had like this whole like hadn't

3396
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:25,000
been planned out.
It was almost like a freestyle rap and

3397
02:11:25,001 --> 02:11:28,320
put it on his instagram.
It is one of the funniest interviews I,

3398
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:33,940
I wish I remember exactly who did it.
He's so odd but awesome.

3399
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:34,930
Yeah.
Awesome.

3400
02:11:34,930 --> 02:11:38,560
And a good thing about him,
a long time ago dish before the ultimate

3401
02:11:38,561 --> 02:11:41,440
fighter,
this guy would send me video tapes from

3402
02:11:41,441 --> 02:11:43,870
the East Coast and we did a note and he
says,

3403
02:11:43,871 --> 02:11:44,710
boss,
I okay,

3404
02:11:44,711 --> 02:11:47,380
this one I won,
but I still can you break it down where

3405
02:11:47,381 --> 02:11:49,570
I have to work on.
And I would write everything down and

3406
02:11:49,571 --> 02:11:51,280
send it back to him.
And then I show him on the ultimate

3407
02:11:51,281 --> 02:11:54,070
fighter and the later I met him in an in
an elevator,

3408
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:54,940
I say,
man,

3409
02:11:54,941 --> 02:11:56,500
you always used to send me to take.
She said,

3410
02:11:56,501 --> 02:11:57,370
yeah,
thank you very much.

3411
02:11:57,371 --> 02:11:59,500
But you see,
I really appreciated about a guy like

3412
02:11:59,501 --> 02:11:59,900
that.

3413
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:00,621
Yeah,
no,

3414
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:02,270
he's uh,
he's a really,

3415
02:12:02,690 --> 02:12:04,540
really dedicated guy.
You know,

3416
02:12:04,740 --> 02:12:09,740
Diego Sanchez is a fucking warrior and
he's a guy who's one more third rounds

3417
02:12:10,011 --> 02:12:13,250
of fights where he lost the first two,
the Martin Kampmann fight.

3418
02:12:13,251 --> 02:12:17,960
I'll never forget his face was hanging
off of his skull and he's chasing

3419
02:12:17,961 --> 02:12:19,200
Martin,
Kevin and Mark Hammond,

3420
02:12:19,201 --> 02:12:22,190
who fought a one 85 was a big fucking
guy for one 70.

3421
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:26,270
And daigo is just,
I just run it out of a mask of blood

3422
02:12:26,660 --> 02:12:29,360
date of the Jake ellenberger fight.
The end of the fight.

3423
02:12:29,361 --> 02:12:31,470
He's on Ellen burgers back.
Beaten the shit out of them.

3424
02:12:31,490 --> 02:12:33,350
That's right.
Lost the first two rounds.

3425
02:12:33,351 --> 02:12:35,180
Comes back in the third like a fucking
savage.

3426
02:12:35,210 --> 02:12:37,070
If every fight was a hundred rounds
long,

3427
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:39,350
Diego Sanchez might be undefeated
Mexican.

3428
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:44,360
Fantastic insurance.
He always had a crazy car.

3429
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:49,070
Do Donald Trump.
That's good alone.

3430
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:52,640
I mean think about who had more
endurance and Julio Cesar Chavez,

3431
02:12:52,641 --> 02:12:53,540
right?
Well yeah,

3432
02:12:53,570 --> 02:12:56,540
you're right.
But then people fail to mention that he

3433
02:12:56,541 --> 02:12:58,830
trained a,
it was in Mexico City or it's 7,000 feet

3434
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:00,080
elevation people.
If you don't,

3435
02:13:00,081 --> 02:13:03,410
don't take wine and his fights,
a lot of his fights were there as well.

3436
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:04,700
Yeah,
that's a good point because a lot of

3437
02:13:04,701 --> 02:13:07,800
people don't realize how high Mexico
City is.

3438
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:09,620
I didn't know until the first time I
went there.

3439
02:13:09,621 --> 02:13:11,720
I just did a fucking elliptical machine
there and I was like,

3440
02:13:11,810 --> 02:13:12,860
Holy Shit.

3441
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:15,570
I said it.
I said it to convalesce cause it'll know

3442
02:13:15,580 --> 02:13:19,380
show are you going to go out like three
weeks ahead because of the elevation?

3443
02:13:19,381 --> 02:13:20,191
And he says,
no,

3444
02:13:20,191 --> 02:13:21,024
we will.
Uh,

3445
02:13:21,420 --> 02:13:25,300
do you think that's a smart idea?
Because you should be training there.

3446
02:13:25,890 --> 02:13:28,440
When I trained for the rental and fight
at the Colorado,

3447
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:31,500
Colorado did,
but my first week days,

3448
02:13:31,501 --> 02:13:32,100
nine days were

3449
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,720
really not nice.
They were not fun.

3450
02:13:33,721 --> 02:13:35,820
They,
I mean I got tired so fast.

3451
02:13:35,821 --> 02:13:38,550
It took really a while for me to get
into it.

3452
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:42,200
And Colorado is 2000 feet below Mexico
City,

3453
02:13:42,201 --> 02:13:45,560
which is correct.
A title fight there.

3454
02:13:46,190 --> 02:13:48,440
Do you remember the second shoot?
What's the second shoe of seed there

3455
02:13:48,470 --> 02:13:50,460
with everybody?
When everybody ran out of gas?

3456
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:54,050
Yeah,
it was the first two U of c's were in

3457
02:13:54,051 --> 02:13:54,741
Colorado.
Oh,

3458
02:13:54,741 --> 02:13:57,050
the first one to make nichols.
And then uh,

3459
02:13:57,380 --> 02:13:58,820
the uh,
uh,

3460
02:13:59,330 --> 02:14:01,010
the,
the other arena downtown.

3461
02:14:01,011 --> 02:14:05,270
I forgot what she said with Joe and Mark
Hunt in Colorado.

3462
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:05,990
Yeah.
Yes sir.

3463
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:07,910
Yeah.
Almost died.

3464
02:14:08,330 --> 02:14:11,840
They both almost died though.
There's only one way to prepare for

3465
02:14:11,841 --> 02:14:13,520
that.
So you have to be in that Lma because

3466
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:16,430
you literally have less red blood cells.
Period.

3467
02:14:16,570 --> 02:14:20,000
Does that Taco guy who's an endurance
athlete who lives in boulder and he told

3468
02:14:20,001 --> 02:14:21,770
me you have to live there for three
years.

3469
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:24,500
He said to get to reach the full
potential.

3470
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:27,350
He's like for free with those guys.
For you when you were talking about

3471
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:30,050
bikers like or triathletes or something
like that,

3472
02:14:30,230 --> 02:14:33,440
like for them,
every last second is in,

3473
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:35,990
because you're doing the same activity
over and over and over again.

3474
02:14:35,991 --> 02:14:38,150
It's not like fighting where your
creativity,

3475
02:14:38,151 --> 02:14:39,970
your explosiveness,
all these different things come coming

3476
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:42,110
in a factor.
It's just biking.

3477
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:43,340
You're just biking,
you're just running.

3478
02:14:43,370 --> 02:14:44,300
You're just,
you're just swimming.

3479
02:14:44,390 --> 02:14:47,180
These are the things you're doing and so
every little second,

3480
02:14:47,210 --> 02:14:51,110
every little ounce of extra endurance.
So the optimize everything in that

3481
02:14:51,111 --> 02:14:53,090
regard.
And he was saying to really hit your

3482
02:14:53,091 --> 02:14:55,700
full potential,
we need to live at altitude and train an

3483
02:14:55,701 --> 02:14:57,170
altitude for three years.
Okay,

3484
02:14:57,171 --> 02:14:58,430
so lifted trains are nice.
Yeah,

3485
02:14:58,700 --> 02:15:00,380
I see that three years.
Wow.

3486
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:04,130
Yeah.
Well full potential go from the 99% that

3487
02:15:04,131 --> 02:15:08,300
you had at one year at to said that
after three years,

3488
02:15:08,301 --> 02:15:09,650
you know,
it could be like that as well.

3489
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:11,390
But I understand what he's spending
threshold.

3490
02:15:11,620 --> 02:15:15,110
If you have like only 10 days or two
weeks to train high altitude,

3491
02:15:15,470 --> 02:15:19,500
I almost would say don't do it because
she'll first week it's going to be the

3492
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:20,510
worst week.
You can't think straight.

3493
02:15:20,511 --> 02:15:21,051
You know,
you,

3494
02:15:21,051 --> 02:15:22,340
it's,
it's better to just stay.

3495
02:15:22,341 --> 02:15:23,900
But if you have to fight at high
altitude,

3496
02:15:23,990 --> 02:15:26,780
always go there beforehand man.
I'm telling you three,

3497
02:15:26,781 --> 02:15:27,800
four weeks at least.

3498
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:28,701
There's the,
uh,

3499
02:15:28,701 --> 02:15:31,130
the first bank center,
which is right by my academy that a

3500
02:15:31,131 --> 02:15:34,100
couple of UFC is there.
When you walk out of the dressing room,

3501
02:15:34,101 --> 02:15:36,290
there's a big metal sign on the wall and
it says,

3502
02:15:36,610 --> 02:15:37,850
uh,
extreme elevation.

3503
02:15:37,851 --> 02:15:40,160
If you,
if you feel light headedness or dizzy,

3504
02:15:40,161 --> 02:15:42,950
please rest to drink water.
So that's what like the fighters see as

3505
02:15:42,951 --> 02:15:45,130
you're walking out to the cage to that
biggest fucking science.

3506
02:15:45,131 --> 02:15:46,270
So it's my fault there.
I was like,

3507
02:15:46,271 --> 02:15:47,730
yeah,
yeah.

3508
02:15:47,870 --> 02:15:50,830
It's crazy for people who don't live
there to take fights at altitude.

3509
02:15:50,870 --> 02:15:51,703
It really is.
Yeah.

3510
02:15:51,890 --> 02:15:54,200
Especially with fights.
Fighters can't afford,

3511
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:56,170
like if you're training for a fight in
Mexico City,

3512
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:58,320
you can't afford to go anywhere.
I mean if you,

3513
02:15:58,610 --> 02:16:01,970
if you're on the undercard you making,
you know what's like the lowest paid

3514
02:16:01,971 --> 02:16:04,910
guys in the UFC males is eight eight.
It's crazy.

3515
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:07,910
It's crazy that I got to,
you got to get on the o two trainer,

3516
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:09,150
they get those lungs

3517
02:16:09,150 --> 02:16:11,450
then that will,
that will help them a little strengthen

3518
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:12,030
him.
Yes sir.

3519
02:16:12,030 --> 02:16:12,601
For sure.
Yeah.

3520
02:16:12,601 --> 02:16:14,250
Because a lot of people say,
oh this part of that,

3521
02:16:14,251 --> 02:16:15,930
you know,
it mimics high altitude can't,

3522
02:16:16,170 --> 02:16:17,760
you cannot.
It doesn't do you.

3523
02:16:17,761 --> 02:16:19,380
Oh you have to wear it like eight hours
a day,

3524
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:21,180
you know,
but otherwise it won't.

3525
02:16:21,210 --> 02:16:23,610
But it makes your holy spirit towards
schist system much stronger and it's

3526
02:16:23,611 --> 02:16:24,510
easier for you to pull in

3527
02:16:24,690 --> 02:16:27,310
when you're talking about your own
personal o two trainer where you put it

3528
02:16:27,311 --> 02:16:30,040
in your mouth and you,
you have like different on to write

3529
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,030
stronger.
Yup.

3530
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:34,980
The stronger with a guy who was a
trainer,

3531
02:16:35,010 --> 02:16:38,430
the scientist behind to Usain Bolt,
three out of gold medalists on track.

3532
02:16:38,431 --> 02:16:39,780
I feel to actually,
um,

3533
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,770
uh,
dominick Cruz as well as training there.

3534
02:16:43,980 --> 02:16:48,240
This guy's a higher Iq and then freaking
Einstein hat he has like over 25 medical

3535
02:16:48,241 --> 02:16:52,420
journals that were very,
when it's proven that only inspiratory

3536
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:53,950
training works.
So what,

3537
02:16:53,951 --> 02:16:55,150
what,
what happened was he,

3538
02:16:55,151 --> 02:16:57,350
he did and um,
uh,

3539
02:16:58,020 --> 02:16:59,700
uh,
review of,

3540
02:16:59,701 --> 02:17:01,470
of,
of my competition and

3541
02:17:01,550 --> 02:17:04,240
that was not explained what this thing
is to people that are listening that

3542
02:17:04,241 --> 02:17:04,830
don't know

3543
02:17:04,830 --> 02:17:06,790
it's an,
it's a device that I invented because I

3544
02:17:06,791 --> 02:17:09,210
was,
I was an asthma patient and I realized

3545
02:17:09,211 --> 02:17:12,120
that after an asthma attack for like a
weekend better eight days in bed,

3546
02:17:12,150 --> 02:17:13,860
I would resume my track and field and I
would,

3547
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:16,700
I would break my running times and it
always bought,

3548
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:18,810
I,
it puzzled me why,

3549
02:17:18,811 --> 02:17:21,110
why am I stronger after an attack?
This is crazy.

3550
02:17:21,130 --> 02:17:23,850
The medicine medication.
And then I realized when I saw,

3551
02:17:23,930 --> 02:17:27,310
I went to the doctor's office and I saw
a poster on the,

3552
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:29,520
on the wall,
but a pair of lungs on there and it

3553
02:17:29,521 --> 02:17:31,540
showed where it's inflamed,
uh,

3554
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:33,200
when you have bronchitis and,
and,

3555
02:17:33,201 --> 02:17:36,450
and what happens is you think as a kid
that's effected in the lungs,

3556
02:17:36,451 --> 02:17:38,490
it's not,
it's in the air pipes that go to the

3557
02:17:38,491 --> 02:17:40,530
lungs.
So that was my Aha moment.

3558
02:17:40,531 --> 02:17:41,580
I realized,
Oh,

3559
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:45,300
I've been working out in my lungs
unknowingly because I'd been pulling air

3560
02:17:45,301 --> 02:17:46,740
through that infected hole.

3561
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:49,890
So unknowingly I made my,
my whole lung system,

3562
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:52,830
my inspiratory system stronger.
So why don't I come up with something

3563
02:17:52,831 --> 02:17:55,200
that controls the air intake and that
was it.

3564
02:17:55,230 --> 02:17:57,120
And then finally I started though.
You got it.

3565
02:17:57,750 --> 02:17:59,850
I started making it.
And it's a very simple device.

3566
02:17:59,851 --> 02:18:02,130
It starts with a whole of 15 millimeter
millimeter.

3567
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:05,850
You start training with it and once you
feel that you get the same air as you

3568
02:18:05,851 --> 02:18:07,950
did before,
you go to 14 millimeter.

3569
02:18:08,310 --> 02:18:10,410
And now with this guy,
what this guy does with it.

3570
02:18:10,411 --> 02:18:13,320
Because when my,
my lawyer called me and he said,

3571
02:18:13,321 --> 02:18:14,820
listen,
did you read that review about our

3572
02:18:14,821 --> 02:18:15,930
competition?
It's horrible.

3573
02:18:15,931 --> 02:18:16,560
They,
they,

3574
02:18:16,560 --> 02:18:18,180
they,
they slammed this.

3575
02:18:18,310 --> 02:18:20,070
I say,
I know because they control the area in

3576
02:18:20,071 --> 02:18:21,570
and out.
It's not a good way to do it.

3577
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:23,100
I said,
contact that guy,

3578
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,540
I want to send them a note to a trainer.

3579
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:27,870
And when he contacted him,
he said boss would do a he bus route

3580
02:18:27,871 --> 02:18:28,800
from the o two trainer.
Yeah,

3581
02:18:28,801 --> 02:18:30,420
we already using it.
Conspiratory trains.

3582
02:18:30,630 --> 02:18:32,670
I love the product.
So what is the difference?

3583
02:18:32,910 --> 02:18:35,400
The differences when you control the air
out as well,

3584
02:18:35,430 --> 02:18:37,790
you cannot completely empty your lungs.
You'll,

3585
02:18:38,130 --> 02:18:41,520
you'll do it with resistance.
But if you complete an air out is all

3586
02:18:41,820 --> 02:18:44,220
with force.
It's all done by your core and your

3587
02:18:44,221 --> 02:18:46,530
diaphragm and your intercostal muscles
here and your rips.

3588
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:48,570
But breathing in,
it's also done with that.

3589
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:52,770
It's much harder to breathe in.
But as soon as I start stopping the

3590
02:18:52,771 --> 02:18:56,200
airflow out,
I cannot completely exhale anymore

3591
02:18:56,220 --> 02:18:59,040
before I take a new breath.
And that's what I started with.

3592
02:18:59,041 --> 02:19:01,380
So now when we going to come out with
all these medical journals,

3593
02:19:01,650 --> 02:19:04,590
with Usain Bolt,
all these people that he trains all do

3594
02:19:04,591 --> 02:19:05,820
inspiratory muscle training.

3595
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:08,180
So they all use that kind of a device
all,

3596
02:19:08,190 --> 02:19:10,240
all use.
Wow.

3597
02:19:10,241 --> 02:19:13,750
So like those masks that you wear,
that control in and out,

3598
02:19:13,751 --> 02:19:14,830
those that,
that,

3599
02:19:14,831 --> 02:19:17,990
that was the cause of competition.
That was the competition yet.

3600
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:21,280
So it's just something that just
controls in and then you can breathe out

3601
02:19:21,281 --> 02:19:24,790
with your own mouth like so you breathe
in through it and then when you breathe

3602
02:19:24,791 --> 02:19:25,151
out,
what do you,

3603
02:19:25,151 --> 02:19:27,950
how does it work when you breathe out?
Freely does that work comes out

3604
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:31,070
because it's got two holes,
one site as to where they have the holes

3605
02:19:31,071 --> 02:19:34,010
on a and on the other side you have a
flap.

3606
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:35,160
And if,
if I breathe in,

3607
02:19:35,161 --> 02:19:38,540
the flap closes.
Brilliant.

3608
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:40,070
Yeah.
And it uh,

3609
02:19:40,290 --> 02:19:42,230
and then worked.
And the only thing that this the

3610
02:19:42,231 --> 02:19:43,430
scientist said,
he said,

3611
02:19:43,431 --> 02:19:46,910
well you could use it like you did boss
with training because a cure me for my

3612
02:19:46,911 --> 02:19:51,010
asthma on my website you will read a lot
of people cure for the asthma.

3613
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:54,140
I don't use an inhaler and more and I
used an inhaler my entire life.

3614
02:19:54,141 --> 02:19:57,900
Even before world title fights always
had an inhaler with me because if it

3615
02:19:57,901 --> 02:19:59,330
would be nice,
for instance,

3616
02:19:59,331 --> 02:20:02,150
very aggressively,
three times my lungs would close.

3617
02:20:02,180 --> 02:20:05,570
I have to open them up with an inhaler.
I haven't used an inhaler for two and a

3618
02:20:05,571 --> 02:20:06,620
half,
three years now anymore.

3619
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:08,450
So it,
it works with everything.

3620
02:20:08,451 --> 02:20:10,020
We were actually looking for an FDA
approval.

3621
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:13,250
Everything is going to happen now
because the results are just crazy.

3622
02:20:13,251 --> 02:20:14,810
Good.
That's fascinating.

3623
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:15,890
Yeah.
Oh and what he said,

3624
02:20:15,891 --> 02:20:19,190
what I wanted to say is what he does,
he lets them in the morning,

3625
02:20:19,220 --> 02:20:23,690
do 30 repetitions to,
to take a smaller tiny hole and you lean

3626
02:20:23,691 --> 02:20:25,690
over with the o two trainer and once
you,

3627
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:29,060
you breathe out,
you every bit of air goes out of your

3628
02:20:29,061 --> 02:20:30,980
lungs and then you,
while you're breathing in,

3629
02:20:30,981 --> 02:20:35,090
you're sitting straight up and then
you'll breathe everything out against

3630
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:36,740
you.
Do so many repetitions in the morning.

3631
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:38,570
That's for you,
for your insight.

3632
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:40,610
So that's all you're doing is just 30
repetitions.

3633
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:42,020
That's it.
And that will build you up.

3634
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:45,110
If you go for six weeks,
two times a day,

3635
02:20:45,111 --> 02:20:47,000
30 minutes and earth,
30 repetitions.

3636
02:20:47,001 --> 02:20:50,300
And after that,
just one time a day to increase,

3637
02:20:50,301 --> 02:20:52,400
you're going to have,
you could not to have any elected assets

3638
02:20:52,401 --> 02:20:54,740
in your core,
which by the way is the most important

3639
02:20:54,741 --> 02:20:55,280
thing if fighting.

3640
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:59,140
That's why everybody gets tired.
I always say because their muscles

3641
02:20:59,170 --> 02:21:00,500
stopped pumping,
you know,

3642
02:21:00,501 --> 02:21:02,630
just like your,
your biceps are pumping and they start

3643
02:21:02,631 --> 02:21:05,540
pushing your lungs backwards.
So now you've launched cannot freely

3644
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:07,490
inhale anymore because you're pushing
them back,

3645
02:21:07,491 --> 02:21:08,390
which,
which your core.

3646
02:21:08,420 --> 02:21:11,210
And that's the reason when you see guys,
you know,

3647
02:21:11,211 --> 02:21:13,850
that's why I used to do,
I actually set that at an a at the

3648
02:21:13,851 --> 02:21:17,420
seminar last Saturday.
I said that's why would you before a

3649
02:21:17,421 --> 02:21:19,910
fight,
I would do a lot of apps but constant

3650
02:21:19,911 --> 02:21:21,800
stretching apps,
apps,

3651
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:22,940
stretches,
apps,

3652
02:21:22,970 --> 02:21:25,070
stretching and I was for that reason
because you know,

3653
02:21:25,071 --> 02:21:26,930
if this gets tight,
your core gets tight.

3654
02:21:27,290 --> 02:21:28,460
Oh,
everything goes down hill.

3655
02:21:28,461 --> 02:21:29,750
That's why the guys in the beginning
with,

3656
02:21:29,751 --> 02:21:31,490
uh,
with the steroid a while at the

3657
02:21:31,491 --> 02:21:32,750
beginning,
there's still doing apparently,

3658
02:21:32,751 --> 02:21:34,280
but you,
you saw guys,

3659
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:36,380
they,
because if you use steroids,

3660
02:21:36,381 --> 02:21:37,850
you pump much harder,
right?

3661
02:21:38,060 --> 02:21:40,910
So they're very strong until the core
build software,

3662
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:44,510
elected acid.
Now the lung skin breathe in anymore.

3663
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:46,190
And that's why you see them going
strong,

3664
02:21:46,191 --> 02:21:46,551
strong,
strong,

3665
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:47,090
strong,
strong.

3666
02:21:47,090 --> 02:21:49,850
And then suddenly they drop and it's
over with them.

3667
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:53,930
That's the reason.
So your protocol for this o two trainer

3668
02:21:53,931 --> 02:21:56,660
is you do it 30 times,
like 30 breaths,

3669
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:58,820
30 breaths in the morning,
30 in the evening.

3670
02:21:58,850 --> 02:22:01,670
After six weeks,
you increase your Holy Spirit.

3671
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:05,180
They say you got 15 to 20% you will
gain.

3672
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:06,530
It's in.
It's incredible.

3673
02:22:06,531 --> 02:22:09,050
You can do in how,
in how long?

3674
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:12,410
How much time does it was six weeks
sweets.

3675
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,221
You got to,
yeah.

3676
02:22:13,221 --> 02:22:15,950
You'll be amazed what once we are going
to come out with all these journals,

3677
02:22:15,980 --> 02:22:19,220
you're going to,
you're going to like 15 to 20% lung

3678
02:22:19,221 --> 02:22:20,240
capacity.
Yeah.

3679
02:22:20,241 --> 02:22:21,630
Look,
this is in spirit,

3680
02:22:21,631 --> 02:22:22,101
Tory,

3681
02:22:22,101 --> 02:22:25,380
There's this other devices now they can
date.

3682
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:26,140
There's still

3683
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:28,770
air in there because they can completely
empty their logs.

3684
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:31,950
We're looking at it for folks who are
just listening to this.
