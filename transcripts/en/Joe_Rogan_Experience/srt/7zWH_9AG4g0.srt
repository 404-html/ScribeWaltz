1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,410
We didn't talk about this the last
time and this was something that was

3
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:08,460
controversial after our podcasts because
during the manhood training camp,

4
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:09,330
your dad died.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,203
Right.

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,290
How hard was that man to go through?

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,920
My Dad and I had like a weird relationship
went dead and I had like a falling

8
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:17,754
out probably

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,520
10 or 12 years ago.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,590
I hadn't spoken 10 years.

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,483
And uh,

12
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,420
uh,

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,580
he came to one of my fights,

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,180
uh,

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,790
when I've won a glory 10 with arts and 11.

16
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,713
And uh,

17
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,120
was one of the biggest things
that Vinny helped me work on it.

18
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,110
I found out my dad had cancer and like
my reaction when my brother and sister

19
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,350
told me it was like fucking like,

20
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,110
I don't care.

21
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,260
Like it didn't really didn't care.

22
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:41,620
He didn't that much that a

23
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,980
wow that uh,

24
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,530
I was just like hated them.

25
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,330
Like we had like a really bad issues.

26
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,223
And uh,

27
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,311
uh,

28
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,540
when I started talking to Vinny,

29
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:51,991
you know,

30
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:52,421
I mentioned,

31
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:52,660
yeah,

32
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,860
my dad had cancer and I didn't know how
I felt about it because part of be like

33
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:56,220
carried,

34
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,401
you know,

35
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,000
at some point.

36
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,900
And Vinny,

37
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,580
uh,

38
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,031
did some,

39
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,420
like a,

40
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,490
he called a timeline
therapy and we had the,

41
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,324
uh,

42
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,220
this is not at all I was
planning on talking about,

43
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:05,371
but,

44
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:06,180
um,

45
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,511
we,

46
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:07,080
uh,

47
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,600
he asked me all of these scenarios like,

48
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,660
think of a time in your life when you
were really proud and then think of a time

49
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:15,720
when you were really upset and like all
these different emotions and he didn't

50
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,410
know what he was,

51
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,970
what it was about or
what was going to happen.

52
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,380
He's just trying it on in every,

53
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,210
one of the things they
talked about was my dad.

54
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,090
Like every one of those
times was a time with my dad.

55
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:24,991
And,

56
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:25,824
uh,

57
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,300
he did like the,

58
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:27,811
you know,

59
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,130
the whole session or whatever.

60
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,233
At the end of it,

61
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,200
I just had no more resentment or anger
towards my dad and it was really weird.

62
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:34,611
And,

63
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:35,370
uh,

64
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,770
it was like this chip on my
shoulder like my whole life.

65
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,071
And,

66
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:38,310
uh,

67
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,410
at one point for a long time.

68
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,180
Uh,

69
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,800
I used to think about my
dad before I would fight,

70
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,210
when I was fighting professionally.

71
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,044
Like I would use,

72
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,170
not necessarily like I'm fighting my
dad but like to shove it up his ass.

73
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:49,291
Like,

74
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,580
look what I'm gonna do,

75
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:51,000
you know?

76
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,331
And,

77
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,164
uh,

78
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,850
I realized that like,

79
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:57,660
that anger that I had and that I've used
to tap into all the time was actually

80
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,150
like coding me back and
was almost like a handicap.

81
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,733
And uh,

82
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,311
yeah.

83
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,144
When I,

84
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,480
when he helped me forgive my dad,

85
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,151
I was able to,

86
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:07,500
uh,

87
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,780
go to Florida as,

88
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,031
you know,

89
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:10,320
he's just got stage four cancer,

90
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,070
he's going to die.

91
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,341
And,

92
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:11,850
uh,

93
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,780
I had a relationship with my dad for the
last year before he died that I hadn't

94
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:19,890
had in 10 years and that was from
that Vinnie helped me do that.

95
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,900
That's got to have a big impact on
the way you raise your own sons.

96
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:26,820
Yeah,

97
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,653
for sure.

98
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,090
Knowing the resentment that you had
towards your father and the anger and the,

99
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:32,220
the bad relationship,

100
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,830
like never wanting it
to get to that place.

101
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,693
Yeah.

102
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:35,940
Yeah.

103
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,773
It was,

104
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,650
it was weird,

105
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,483
it was a,

106
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,383
you know,

107
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,950
Vinny didn't know that he was,

108
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,660
that that was even going to be
the result and he was just like,

109
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:43,720
oh,

110
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,540
I want to try this timeline
therapy thing on you.

111
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,433
And uh,

112
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:46,801
yeah,

113
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:50,070
I went from like completely hating
him to like just can forgiving him

114
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:50,611
completely,

115
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:54,300
not like halfass for giving him
to like waiting for that apology.

116
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:55,410
Like there was no apology.

117
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,460
There was no talking about it.

118
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,930
It was like completely starting over.

119
00:02:57,931 --> 00:02:58,764
And uh,

120
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,351
yeah,

121
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,670
we had like a really good

122
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,450
relationship for that
last year before he died.

123
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,781
And,

124
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:05,260
um,

125
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,310
I knew that he was,

126
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,750
he was battling cancer.

127
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,000
My brother started treating him.

128
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:10,990
He was stage four.

129
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,381
I mean,

130
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,640
it was the doctor's like,

131
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:12,791
you know,

132
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,690
as your dad's going to die,

133
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:17,770
he had cancer and as long as cancer in
his brain cancer in his chest and she

134
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:18,730
cancer in his neck,

135
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,020
he had like this giant mass.

136
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:20,854
I was neck.

137
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,581
And,

138
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:22,414
uh,

139
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,060
my brother started treating
him with CBD oil and,

140
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:25,894
uh,

141
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,740
allegedly I was shipping it to him
from here and to Florida or whatever.

142
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,290
But that was probably wasn't very good.

143
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,171
It allegedly,

144
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,710
allegedly there was fiction for
Fisher friction operational purposes.

145
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:36,820
Um,

146
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,211
and we,

147
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:37,450
uh,

148
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,370
we're giving them CBD oil for about,

149
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:40,961
I don't know,

150
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,550
I guess seven months probably.

151
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,081
And,

152
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:44,914
uh,

153
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,271
after,

154
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,104
um,

155
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,850
he wasn't going to chemo,

156
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,800
he just didn't want to do it.

157
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:50,740
He was like really stubborn.

158
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm stubborn.

159
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,140
Guy wouldn't do that.

160
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:53,974
And uh,

161
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,611
they,

162
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:55,444
uh,

163
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,560
they tested him,

164
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,880
they did like a graph or whatever to see
where the cancer had grown or whatever

165
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,570
period of time.

166
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,170
And they were shocked that
90% of the cancer had died,

167
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,330
that there was 90% of the cancer was
dead and 10% of the cancer that was still

168
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:14,350
alive was like completely surrounded
in dead cells so that they couldn't get

169
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,330
even medicine to it and it couldn't grow.

170
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,700
And it was just gonna he was
gonna have to live with it,

171
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,563
you know,

172
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,330
but it was completely
surrounded by dead cancer cells.

173
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,500
And the only thing possibly that could
have done it was the CBD oil because he

174
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:28,030
was doing nothing else correctly.

175
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,291
He was like,

176
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,124
um,

177
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,341
you know,

178
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,430
they had them on so many narcotics
and pain pills and stuff that he was,

179
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,140
he's a asshole to be around.

180
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,880
It was really hard.

181
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,280
It was like constantly
on like this drug thing.

182
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,233
Um,

183
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,260
and he wouldn't eat.

184
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,390
He only wanted to eat was like
chocolate cake and ice cream,

185
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,020
you know,

186
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,441
like wouldn't,

187
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:46,570
it was like really hard ad for cancer.

188
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:47,404
We're like,

189
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,041
we're like,

190
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:48,350
uh,

191
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:48,610
you know,

192
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,590
trying to get them to the
right supplements in and,

193
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,723
you know,

194
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,621
it was a,

195
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:53,680
it was a tough situation,

196
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,161
but the,

197
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:54,341
uh,

198
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,620
the CBD oil was,

199
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,760
was beating the cancer and the
cancer wasn't what killed him.

200
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:02,761
He actually died from like starvation
or mount nourishment from not doing what

201
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,490
we would beg him to do really well.

202
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,070
90% of the cancer was dead CBD oil people.

203
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,963
It really works.

204
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,770
Working right now from my friend's mom,

205
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,170
my friend's mom has stage
four cancer and her brain,

206
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,040
uh,

207
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,670
I allegedly got them some CBD oil and uh,

208
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,500
he,

209
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:19,920
he,

210
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,753
um,

211
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,090
got it to his mom.

212
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,480
Uh,

213
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,150
within less than two months,

214
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:30,390
her cancer had shrunk by 30% that she
had been doing chemo and they were saying

215
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,070
that her immune system was
so devastated by the chemo,

216
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,950
the chemo is probably going to kill
her quicker than the cancer was.

217
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:39,670
And they'd recommended her stopping
chemo and he was just in full desperation

218
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:39,920
mode.

219
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,301
My friends,

220
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,980
real super straight edge,

221
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:42,821
he just,

222
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:43,421
he's just,

223
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:43,960
you know,

224
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,270
Mr Republican American doesn't,

225
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:46,460
you know,

226
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,620
thinks Obama's a Muslim,

227
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:52,300
that kind of guy and it never would want
to have anything to do with CBD oil or

228
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:52,661
anything.

229
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:53,260
Cannabis.

230
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,560
I got it to him and now his mom can sleep.

231
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,500
She's eating,

232
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,880
she sleeps at night.

233
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,250
She doesn't have pain
anymore or tumor shrinking.

234
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,540
The doctors are astounded.

235
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,441
Those stories,

236
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,460
you hear so many of them,

237
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:09,170
it's almost like they seem like
anecdotal fairy tales because until it's,

238
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,440
it happened to someone you actually know
and care about and then you go and then

239
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,460
you start getting angry.

240
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,061
Like,

241
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:18,650
this is what these God damn assholes
that are making laws in this country and

242
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:21,920
fighting against as the lobbyists and
the people that are working for the

243
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:25,250
pharmaceutical companies that are actively
trying to suppress this information.

244
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,920
You are keeping one of the best ways to,

245
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,270
to heal these people.

246
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,870
You're keeping it illegal and it's,

247
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:32,330
it's a fucking horrible crime

248
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,670
and they won't even tell you about it,

249
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:34,930
which is just atrocious.

250
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:35,030
They,

251
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,810
my dad is there giving my
brother the talk that my dad is,

252
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,370
is going to die and it's,

253
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,630
it's terminal and you know,

254
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:42,910
all this stuff for,

255
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,571
you know,

256
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:44,500
weeks and weeks and weeks.

257
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:45,580
He's going to the doctor.

258
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:46,990
And finally my brother's like,

259
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:47,201
hey,

260
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:48,070
so you know,

261
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:48,640
what about,

262
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,300
you know,

263
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,170
medical marijuana,

264
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:51,060
is that something that,

265
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:51,790
and they were like,

266
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,151
oh yeah,

267
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:53,950
we can prescribe him Marinol,

268
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,813
but we just can't,

269
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,211
you know,

270
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:58,570
there's no question that
the cannabis or Thc,

271
00:06:58,571 --> 00:06:59,150
whatever it is,

272
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,560
uh,

273
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
cannabis helps fight cancer,

274
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:02,314
but we can't,

275
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,071
we can't refer.

276
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:03,671
You have to ask.

277
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:04,900
We can't just offer it to you.

278
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,490
And then they gave him that the,

279
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:07,000
uh,

280
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,260
prescription for Marinol,

281
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:13,120
which is like the government
pharmaceutical form of the pill,

282
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:15,180
which is probably where
weaker than the two year old.

283
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,023
And we were giving him,

284
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,080
yeah.

285
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,390
Not,

286
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,400
not nearly as good.

287
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,001
So yeah,

288
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:20,320
like we got the call,

289
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:23,440
I got the call from my dad or my
brother that my dad had passed away.

290
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,383
Um,

291
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,110
I think it was three weeks before the,

292
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:26,580
uh,

293
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,700
the Melvin Madoff fight.

294
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,350
And I flew home to,

295
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:30,184
um,

296
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,450
to Florida to,

297
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,751
you know,

298
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,290
kind of with my brother and sister and
figure out the situation where we were

299
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:35,711
going to do.

300
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:38,470
And my brother picked me up
from the airport and we went to,

301
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,323
you know,

302
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,840
straight to the bar to a,

303
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:41,320
you know,

304
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,430
have it out about my dad.

305
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:42,731
And,

306
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:43,564
um,

307
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,100
when we got back to his house,

308
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,100
my uncle had calls and you know,

309
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,040
we just assumed that my uncle was calling,

310
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,090
was going to give us his sorry to,

311
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,020
sorry about your dad.

312
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,580
And my sister answered the phone
and my uncle was hysterical.

313
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:57,920
And,

314
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,300
uh,

315
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,740
I guess my cousin Cody,

316
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:00,730
who was 23,

317
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,740
I was very close with
his huge fan of mine,

318
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,713
um,

319
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,180
had fallen off a balcony on their
vacation and died the same day.

320
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:07,751
And,

321
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:08,560
uh,

322
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,393
so it was,

323
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,810
it was a ton of stuff
to deal with that last,

324
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,110
you know,

325
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,120
two weeks for my fight.

326
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:13,601
And,

327
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,434
um,

328
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,101
again,

329
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:16,210
I talked to Vinny and,

330
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:17,044
uh,

331
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:17,351
you know,

332
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:19,640
he helped me stay focused
on what it needed to do,

333
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,760
do to handle business in that fight.

334
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:21,981
And,

335
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:22,690
uh,

336
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:22,920
you know,

337
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,270
of any Pharma can't think
of enough for that stuff,

338
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,483
that's

339
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,820
gotta be unbelievably difficult to do.

340
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:29,660
Both of those things.

341
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:33,710
Unbelievably difficult to deal with
while you're trying to focus on,

342
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,380
especially finding guy like
man holds a scary fuck,

343
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:36,620
you know,

344
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,190
every,

345
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,680
every post anybody tags for you and is
like Mo and Madoff's highlight reel.

346
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:41,761
It's like,

347
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:43,650
fuck it just,

348
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,340
it was tough,

349
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:44,700
you know,

350
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,481
and it just drains.

351
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:45,980
You haven't,

352
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,960
I tried to and come back and I got two
weeks left for the fight and I'm trying

353
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:49,200
to,

354
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,500
you know,

355
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,540
try to stay focused and,

356
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,260
uh,

357
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,471
you know,

358
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:53,221
I can run at a,

359
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:54,270
at a good clip and,

360
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:54,770
you know,

361
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,680
I run miles,

362
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,131
you know,

363
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:57,180
regularly and like,

364
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:00,690
I'd be like half a mile in and just be
exhausted because all of this mental

365
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:02,010
stuff just wears on you.

366
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,401
And,

367
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,234
uh,

368
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,541
you know,

369
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,320
I had this internal battle of myself,

370
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,401
if,

371
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:05,551
you know,

372
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:07,500
should I pull out of the fight
and not pull out of the fight?

373
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:09,300
And I talked to Vinny and I was like,

374
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:09,650
you know,

375
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,260
I just,

376
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,093
I don't know what to do.

377
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,581
And,

378
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:12,414
uh,

379
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,170
he was like,

380
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,850
he's just a dick actually.

381
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,511
He was like,

382
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:16,344
uh,

383
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,251
he was like,

384
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:17,521
your,

385
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:19,020
your dad and inner cousin died.

386
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,650
And I was like,

387
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,250
yes.

388
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,083
And he's like an and that,

389
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,930
that's sad.

390
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,763
And I'm like,

391
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,603
yes.

392
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,241
And he's like,

393
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,074
and,

394
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,680
uh,

395
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,700
you're never gonna see them again.

396
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:27,061
And I'm like,

397
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:27,271
yeah,

398
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:27,511
man,

399
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,231
I'm never gonna see him again.

400
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:28,670
He's like,

401
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,700
and that's not fair.

402
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,563
And I was like,

403
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,561
yeah,

404
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,850
motherfucker is not fair.

405
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,690
You know?

406
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,231
And he's like,

407
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:34,650
uh,

408
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:34,831
you know,

409
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,521
he says all this shit.

410
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:35,941
And then he's like,

411
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:36,774
now what?

412
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,651
And I was like,

413
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:38,100
what do you mean?

414
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,371
And he's like,

415
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:39,204
what are you going to do now?

416
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:40,951
And I was like,

417
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:41,221
he's like,

418
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,920
are you going to not ever fight again
and you gotta not to carry your family,

419
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:47,190
you're going to let this stop you from
everything you've ever wanted to do.

420
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,421
And I'm just like,

421
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:48,661
no.

422
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,494
And he's like putting in,

423
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,190
turn off that APP and wait until
after your fight handle your business.

424
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:53,971
You know,

425
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:57,030
whether you're religious or not at
some level somewhere you think your,

426
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,500
your cousin and your father,

427
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,190
what would they want?

428
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,671
And it was like,

429
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:00,060
well,

430
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,500
I talked to both of them about the fight.

431
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,670
They were both excited about the fight.

432
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:03,690
I knew what they were going to want.

433
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,230
So I just kind of turned off that
emotion until after the fight.

434
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,450
And when I knocked out Melvin,

435
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,673
there's like this,

436
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,020
this was this moment right after,

437
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:17,260
like the referee stops it at like fucking
explode and there's bullets worth post

438
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:18,150
the picture all the time.

439
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,860
But like at that moment was like all of
that emotion that I had turned off like

440
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:23,040
came back right at that moment.

441
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,903
And uh,

442
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:24,540
you know,

443
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,870
after the fight I was thinking about
them and stuff and it was really cool.

444
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,160
Wow.

445
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,113
Wow.

446
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,470
That's intense.

447
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,443
Wow.

448
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,860
But there's stuff that's an iconic photo
to the photo of you right after you

449
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:39,694
knocked him out.

450
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,260
It's a pretty intense photo.

451
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,420
That was a crazy fight too,

452
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,254
man.

453
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,400
It was a big one.

454
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,890
It was a big one from Calvin
is a wild motherfucker.

455
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,490
Dude.

456
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:48,731
Win,

457
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,031
lose,

458
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,670
draw that fucking you're,

459
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,540
you're in for some chaos with that guy.

460
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,011
Crazy.

461
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,660
Those all those guys from that mix jam.

462
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:56,800
Badr Hari Him.

463
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,690
[inaudible] there's so many of those guys.

464
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,220
Just fucking ferocious.

465
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:00,381
Yeah,

466
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:00,820
that's there,

467
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,730
that style out of that.

468
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,350
What I mean those,

469
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,190
that's why we're all there.

470
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:03,761
It is right there.

471
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:03,971
Yeah.

472
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:05,530
That was that moment right there.

473
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,801
Well,

474
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:06,700
we're running out of time,

475
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:06,881
man.

476
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:07,750
So let's end it with that.

477
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,870
That's a fucking perfect picture
to wrap this podcast up with.

478
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,330
That's intense

479
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,130
with Melvin down behind you.

480
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:15,700
You need that.

481
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,810
You gather on your gym.

482
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,860
Does that up on the wall?

483
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,690
Yeah.

484
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,320
I gotta put it up on the wall and shit.

485
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,840
Fucking for sure be up at the yard.

486
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:32,820
Yeah.
