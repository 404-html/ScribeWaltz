1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,410
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please welcome Dan Harris and Jeff

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,910
Warren.
I don't know why it started off that

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,830
way.
Just felt weird.

4
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:16,050
It was weird to start starting
aesthetics as always,

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,330
very odd.
Uh,

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,680
welcome.
Welcome Jeffrey.

7
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:19,530
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,740
Dan.
First tank experience.

9
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:23,330
We didn't talk too much about it.
No,

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,620
he just got out of the sensory
deprivation tank.

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,510
I don't even know if that's a word.
Dragoon it is a word.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,680
Um,
uh,

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,740
you know,
we should tell people how you did it.

14
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,850
You basically taunted me on text,
which was awesome.

15
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,870
It was called hot,
but you were saying that you were scared

16
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:43,400
of being in there.
Might be scared.

17
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:45,530
There's nothing to be scared of.
It's just water.

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,410
Yeah.
But it's not just water because you're

19
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:53,360
in this enclosed space.
You can't see anything or hear anything

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,470
weird or is in your mind though.

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,940
Well that is absolutely correct.
I just happened to have a mind that is

22
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:02,630
really good at panicking and I've
demonstrated that time and again to

23
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:06,350
myself and others.
So I was a little wary that you call me

24
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:07,280
a chicken and I was like,
well,

25
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:08,730
fuck,
now I have to do this thing.

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,670
Uh,
so I did it.

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,280
Not without trepidation,
but it was really interesting,

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,850
really interesting.
I know you spent so much time exploring

29
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:21,851
your consciousness and meditating and
just being in your head that I felt like

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,260
this is something that you really should
be exposed to you.

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,700
You're absolutely right.
And I appreciate it.

32
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:26,480
I really do.
It was,

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,530
it was,
what I realized is I think I need to do

34
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:33,800
more of it because the brief discussion
we had,

35
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,410
I know we want it to not fully explore
it until we got on the,

36
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,070
on the Pod,
a brief discussion we had afterwards.

37
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,030
One of the things you said is that it's
good to kind of explore your boundaries

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,580
when it comes to fear.
This is something actually that my

39
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:51,020
meditation teacher has said to me before
and it made me realize I think I need to

40
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,560
get in there and start pushing it a
little bit in this,

41
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,840
um,
in the tank,

42
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,200
uh,
because it will help me in lots of areas

43
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:03,020
of my life because when you don't test
those boundaries,

44
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:06,890
your life becomes smaller and smaller
and that happens to people with panic.

45
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,660
It will,
it happens.

46
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,480
Just people in general.
And I think it's one of the reasons why

47
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:15,410
people fall into panic is because they
don't have enough experience with

48
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:19,070
stressful situations to the point where
they could just relax and just let it

49
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,980
happen.
And that that's one of the things that

50
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,990
I.
One of the reasons why I think martial

51
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:28,220
arts training is very good for people,
not just for the self defense aspect of

52
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:31,370
it,
but for the aspect of just dealing with

53
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:35,020
stressful situations on a regular basis
to the point where you're very

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,590
comfortable with them and then you
realize that the consequences of this is

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,580
it's not really as bad as you think it
is.

56
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,360
Like most people are terrified a
physical confrontation,

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,240
but when you have physical confrontation
on a regular basis,

58
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,810
especially through my favorite,
which is Jujitsu training,

59
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:53,540
because there's no striking so you don't
get hit in the head,

60
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,670
you're not worried about brain damage or
any of that stuff.

61
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,700
It's just basically grappling.
But that through continual

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,240
process of testing yourself and stress
and regular life stresses sort of become

63
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:08,990
diminished.

64
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,130
I think it's really important.
You know,

65
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:15,131
I do some of this in my life,
been live news presentation is stressful

66
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:18,770
and I do that a lot of.
I've covered many war zones,

67
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:21,230
which is much more stressful,
very stressful.

68
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,720
Um,
but I think there are areas in my life

69
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,620
where I've closed off because of
claustrophobia in particular.

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,980
I need Mris for sir.
I jacked up my,

71
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,010
both of my shoulders and my knee and I
haven't been able to deal with them

72
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:38,780
because I just won't get in a scanner.
Jeff and I were down at actually at

73
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:42,320
vanderbilt where they wanted to take a
look in my brain in a scanner while I

74
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:43,790
meditated.
I couldn't do it.

75
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,700
That was a great opportunity.
It's really expensive to get a

76
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:49,280
neuroscience is to look at your brain
while you meditate.

77
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,930
And I wasn't able to do it because I'm
afraid.

78
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,470
Uh,
and so I think

79
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,160
afraid of it seems like there's no
physical fear,

80
00:03:58,161 --> 00:03:59,780
right?
It's not like there's a dog in the room

81
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,860
that's going to bite you.
Right?

82
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,070
So why not just force yourself to

83
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,180
go through it?
Well,

84
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,070
have you ever expand?
Have you ever had a panic attack?

85
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,060
No.
So it panic attack is,

86
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:10,690
you know,
we evolved for this fight or flight

87
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:13,570
instinct where your brain,
you know,

88
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:17,860
when you're faced with a saber tooth
tiger or whatever with the brain floods

89
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:21,880
with adrenaline and it is overwhelming.
I made,

90
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:25,420
it overwhelms all reason.
And you,

91
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,100
uh,
either fight or flight,

92
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:31,390
in this case,
it's flight a flea and you,

93
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,470
you're,
you're,

94
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,560
you can't control your body in many
ways.

95
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,460
And uh,
because I've had so many panic attacks,

96
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,570
I'm primarily the ones that people know
about or the one in particular was on

97
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,710
television on Good Morning America in
2004.

98
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,340
When your brain learns how to do this,
it gets really good at it.

99
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,570
And,
uh,

100
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,640
there's no,
you can't hurl yourself into the,

101
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,640
um,
at least I can't hurl myself into the

102
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,020
Lotus position and meditated away.
It is overwhelming.

103
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,530
And so I can't tell myself a story
about,

104
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:07,510
hey,
I'm not in physical danger because the

105
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,950
body,
the brain is just

106
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,120
what you're saying is very interesting
about getting really good at it.

107
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:17,800
There's a term in archery called target
panic and it happens to people.

108
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:20,400
It happens to target archers.
It happens to bowhunters.

109
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,650
And there's a thing that happens where
you literally can't keep the pin on the

110
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:26,890
target.
Your,

111
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,500
your brain won't let you and no one
understands,

112
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,190
like the people that are having it while
it's happening,

113
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:36,160
they don't understand that like,
I can't believe I can't do this,

114
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,460
but your brain gets so used to freaking
out in this moment that literally you no

115
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:48,430
longer have control and you just,
you try to make the shot go off as quick

116
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,860
as you can.
You'll miss by feet and you just,

117
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,090
you can't.
You understand it.

118
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,490
Like I practice everyday,
like how is this happening?

119
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,480
But if there's this weird overwhelming
sensation of adrenaline and fear and

120
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,580
nerves and the chaos of the moment and
you just slam the trigger and the Arrow

121
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:07,730
goes flying nowhere near the target and
it's really,

122
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:11,720
really common to the point where people
seek psychologists and sports trainers

123
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,870
and there's always different methods
that they use to try to keep in,

124
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,130
in a controlled loop system of,
of thought process to try to handle

125
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:19,730
this.

126
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,500
Probably like you said,
athletic trainers would probably the,

127
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,300
the fighting it and then getting into
your head about it.

128
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,700
It's probably the same as when you get
in a slump in baseball,

129
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,420
you know,
it's,

130
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,050
you're just locked up in yourself and it
takes a long time to get over it.

131
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,393
That is,
you know,

132
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,920
in the tank.
I was thinking a lot about how that has

133
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:41,921
been just a huge recurring theme in my
life where the ego steps in the thinking

134
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:47,060
mind,
the mind that won't surrender to what is

135
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:52,061
actually happening right now comes in.
I get locked up and can't do what I want

136
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:54,230
to do.
One of the things jeff and I have talked

137
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:59,231
a lot about in our time together is
dancing as an I can't do it,

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,390
can't do it isn't the right way to say
it,

139
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:06,350
but I've struggled for a long time with
dropping myself consciousness enough so

140
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,400
that I can dance in a way that,
uh,

141
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:09,770
you know,
I have a three year old around the house

142
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:14,150
and we'd like to dance.
And even around him I get a little in my

143
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:16,790
own head about it and I think all of
these things are related.

144
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,160
They must,
they have to be.

145
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,430
It completely makes sense,
but it doesn't make sense to me that you

146
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:26,780
can't get your brain examined when you
spend so much time examining your brain.

147
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,870
Yeah.
So what's different is,

148
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,753
is this it

149
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,420
interesting time to talk about like the
difference between the brain and the

150
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:35,550
mind.
So I'm looking at my mind,

151
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,820
um,
and uh,

152
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,290
you know,
the,

153
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,960
the idea of,
first of all,

154
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,770
just because I spend,
I spent the last nine years looking

155
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,660
closely at my mind doesn't mean that
I've conquered all my neuroses and I

156
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:54,930
don't know that that's on offer.
I think it's a gradual process,

157
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,890
you pointed to something important about
testing those limits and I think

158
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:01,800
meditation can be really helpful and
testing those limits and I was

159
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:06,801
meditating most of the time that I was
in the tank and that allowed me bringing

160
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:09,060
that kind of focused attention to what
was happening,

161
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,750
allow me not to get carried away with
the waves of fear that came in and I was

162
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,220
able to let them pass without hopping
out an embarrassing myself.

163
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,490
Um,
but I don't know that I can magically.

164
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,940
I think it's going to be a process
before I can get in an MRI is.

165
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
But what I'm trying to say in a long
way.

166
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,710
Well,
if you have damaged shoulders when you

167
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,270
kind of have to.
I do,

168
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,790
I do.
Do you know you don't,

169
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,850
but you don't even know what's wrong.

170
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,750
I think it's Bursitis,
but I need to get a diagnosis before I

171
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:42,010
can figure out whether I got to get
surgery or cortisone shot or whatever it

172
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:42,500
is.

173
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,420
Full range of motion.
Can you put your arms over your head?

174
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,940
Yeah,
yeah,

175
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,610
yeah.
You should try hanging.

176
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,540
Have you ever looked into hang the
southern,

177
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,200
it's just something else crazy.
You're trying to get music from your

178
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,460
shoulders,
a dangerous dude to hang onto a bar and

179
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,070
having your weight.
It's

180
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,870
really important for the shoulder joint
and it's something that very few people

181
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,150
do on a regular basis.
I don't do it on a regular basis.

182
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,200
Most people don't.
And even people that work out don't.

183
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,390
And you're constantly compressing your
shoulder,

184
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,180
compressing and with poor posture,
compressing it with stress,

185
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:16,890
exercise and your shoulder needs to
expand.

186
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,891
And it also needs this sensation of
hanging your body weight from your

187
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,780
hands.
It's tremendous.

188
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:28,110
Rear shoulder impingements.
And there's some doctors.

189
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,090
There's one doctor in particular that
explored this.

190
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,420
See if you could find that guy's name,
um,

191
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,610
who stopped doing most shoulder
surgeries and started putting people on

192
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:40,320
hanging therapy where he just tells
them,

193
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,131
you know,
at the beginning,

194
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,710
just have a bar that's not quite above
your head.

195
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:46,920
So they could just sort of relax your
knees and you know,

196
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,560
if you can't carry all of your weight in
your hands,

197
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,230
just carry a good percentage of your
weight in your hands.

198
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,500
And try to relax your shoulders and it
releases impingements,

199
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:59,370
it's stretches that joint out.
The idea is that we came from tree

200
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:02,610
swinging primates and then as tree swing
primates,

201
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,510
we're constantly doing that and that's
what the shoulder joint is meant to do.

202
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:10,540
It's meant to articulate in that way we,
you grabbed something swinging and then

203
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,220
not having this full range of motion and
not using it on a regular basis.

204
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,590
Here's this guy's book,
I'm Dr John Kirsch,

205
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,740
John M Kirsch and um,
he came up with this many years ago when

206
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,840
he realized that one of the things that
was messing people up was just they

207
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,360
just,
their joints weren't being put through

208
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:36,780
the full range of motion.
And that by hanging you could release a

209
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:40,530
tremendous amount of pain and a
discomfort that a lot of people are

210
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:41,640
facing.
That makes a ton of sense.

211
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,660
So it seems to me that you guys are
actually saying talking about the same

212
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,660
thing when you're talking about the mind
and you're talking about the body and

213
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:51,450
talking about impingement and you're
talking about where your mind is

214
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,140
limited.

215
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,550
I think it's the same exact dynamic
actually that's of what's going on.

216
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,890
Like how would you define what an
impingement is in the body?

217
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,510
A blockade,
you know,

218
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:05,220
like I say,
lack of range of motion,

219
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,400
um,
poor exercise habits.

220
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,590
There's a variety of factors,
ignoring potential injuries and then

221
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,040
restricting your motion to the point
where everything's sort of tightens up.

222
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,470
Muscle tissue in particular.
Um,

223
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,280
joint tissue like around the shoulders
and any,

224
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,070
anytime where you're dealing with range
of motion issues,

225
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:30,420
you have to stretch and you're,
most people very rarely stretched their

226
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,580
shoulders.
It's just something that we don't do.

227
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,880
And also most people very rarely
strengthened their shoulders.

228
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,520
And I think,
uh,

229
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,780
it's,
it's a very complex joint mean you look

230
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:43,860
at the way your shoulders articulate.
There's not like there's not anything in

231
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:46,830
your body that can do this sort of
things and the range of motion that your

232
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,350
shoulders exhibit while carrying weight.

233
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,760
So you think about all the different
things.

234
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,800
Carrying your kid,
picking up a briefcase,

235
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:56,470
you doing a lot of weird motions with
your shoulders and occasionally develop

236
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:57,940
little tears.
Those tears.

237
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,460
I started out superficial.
They get larger,

238
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:02,440
you injure them more,
you're playing,

239
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:04,360
you don't warm up,
something pops,

240
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,640
you ignore it,
it hurts you for years.

241
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,910
There's a lot of things that we do to
our bodies that would just.

242
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,090
It just compiles and you never handle
it.

243
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,520
You never deal with it.
You don't get that Mri,

244
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:18,850
you don't get therapy and it just gets
worse and worse to the point where

245
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,160
seeing a lot of people get shoulder
replacements,

246
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,550
so the exact same thing is true.
Everything you just said is true for the

247
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,560
mind.
It's exactly the same.

248
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:30,070
It's conditioning.
It's repeating the same pattern over and

249
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:32,650
over.
Having some kind of involuntary response

250
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,870
that gets a little bit deeper,
a little bit deeper,

251
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,590
a little bit deeper each time and it's
like your.

252
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Your mind is the mental body and it has
habits and it develops bad habits and it

253
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:46,210
develops limited range of motions,
what it can do,

254
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,160
and so we ended up in this really narrow
situation inevitably because we ended up

255
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,800
with a particular set of conditioning
and it starts to limit us.

256
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:57,910
So you use practices just like a used
physical practices to open up your range

257
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:02,380
of motion to work through impingements
to have more flexibility.

258
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,360
You do the same for,
you know,

259
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,670
with meditation or with other kind of
mental practices.

260
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,600
I think it's literally the same thing
and you and that there's just this sort

261
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,420
of a isometric nature between the mind
and body.

262
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:16,760
It's the same kind of stuff.
It completely makes sense and that was

263
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,950
what we were talking about before the
podcast when we're in the hallway about

264
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,550
just dealing with stressful situations
in the tank.

265
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,070
Like if there's a weird freak out that
happens,

266
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:29,460
like how do you handle it?
Like what,

267
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,640
what do you do?
And I was saying that the more stressful

268
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:37,540
situations that I experienced,
the more understand what they are and

269
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,380
the more I can relax,
but it's also like a matter of

270
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:46,210
constantly being exposed to these
stressful situations where there's not a

271
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:51,211
long break in between doing standup or a
long break in between martial arts

272
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:56,170
training where to the point where
anxiety can build up and then once you

273
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:57,190
get into it,
it's almost an.

274
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,370
It's an unusual situation instead of a
usual one.

275
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,550
That's probably why I probably need to
get in the tank reasonably soon.

276
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,570
Yeah,
so say more.

277
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,050
If you don't,
this is your shot,

278
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:10,690
but if you don't mind,
would you say more about that because

279
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:12,790
you,
you're able to get in the tank,

280
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,170
not only regularly,
but you'll,

281
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,410
you'll dose yourself with some stuff to
get an attack.

282
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,450
Well,
the,

283
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:23,680
the,
the thing about stressful situations is

284
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,850
a,
you're always trying to,

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,760
once you get comfortable,
you are trying to push them and make

286
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:30,070
them more stressful.
And this most district,

287
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,450
most stressful way to experience the
tank is either edibles or mushrooms.

288
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,640
Those are the two for me.
Mushroom?

289
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,570
Yeah.
Wow.

290
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,370
Yeah.
Well it's just,

291
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,850
it's basically mushrooms without any of
the distractions of your body and also

292
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,970
distilled.
It's a pure culture.

293
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,950
Yeah.
Pure culture.

294
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,290
Mushrooms and.
But,

295
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,780
but animals can be just as potent in
their edible marijuana is.

296
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,370
You know the difference.
Most people aren't aware that it's a

297
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,740
completely different psychoactive
substance when it's.

298
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,760
When you eat it because it's processed
by your liver and your body produces

299
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:11,570
something called 11 hydroxy metabolite.
That's four to five times more

300
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:15,920
psychoactive than thc and it's not
psychoactive in the smoking version.

301
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,160
It's very different.
That's why a lot of people when they eat

302
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,580
brownies so strong.
Yeah.

303
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm sure there was a famous nine slash
11 case where uh,

304
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,850
uh,
there's an audio recording of these cops

305
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,680
that took some pop from some kids and
made pot brownies of it and then ate it

306
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,580
and then called the police and called
nine slash 11 on themselves because they

307
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:40,070
thought they were dying.
But it is one of the greatest audio

308
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:45,071
recordings of all time,
I think of dying.

309
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:47,540
I think time is really.
So please send help.

310
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,340
Oh my God.
That's awesome.

311
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,910
What do you do in those moments?
Like do you have,

312
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,250
is that.
I'm just interested because you've had,

313
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,560
from what I can tell,
quite a bit of experience with

314
00:15:56,561 --> 00:16:01,561
psychedelics and also isolation tanks.
What's the right term for sensory

315
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,880
deprivation?
Sensory deprivation tanks.

316
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,800
So what do you do when the little lamp
in your head starts telling you like the

317
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,860
world's ending or slow?

318
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,400
Just let it go.
You have to just relax.

319
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,080
I mean,
I've been there 100 times,

320
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,660
more,
many more than a hundred times really,

321
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,850
but were you really nervous?
Really scared,

322
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,120
but what compounds it is trying to
control it.

323
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:28,450
What compounds it is trying to wrestle
the moment away from this experience and

324
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:31,580
just taking control of it and try to
sober yourself up.

325
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,301
No,
fuck this.

326
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:33,290
I'm going to.
I'm going to,

327
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,270
you know,
I gotta I gotta get getting control of

328
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:38,550
the situation and the freak out is
really what compounded.

329
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,000
That's where the,
that's the root of all,

330
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,020
you know,
air quotes,

331
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:46,240
bad trips come from is this desire to
control failure.

332
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,900
Just surrender.
You've got to surrender.

333
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:50,730
You've got to relax and resistance.
Yeah,

334
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,000
nothing's gonna happen to you.
You're going to be fine.

335
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,570
You're going to feel really crazy and
you're going to that.

336
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,330
It brings up memories from years ago
from weird conversations you might've

337
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,370
had where you acted poorly or weird
choices that you might've made decades

338
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,190
ago or you know,
things that crossed your mind a couple

339
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:11,950
of days ago that you're embarrassed
about.

340
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,100
There's all these different things
that'll come out that will just your,

341
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,760
your,
your brain,

342
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:20,180
your mind,
your consciousness wants to explore

343
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:24,440
these because it feels that you
neglected them or that you put them on

344
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,780
the back burner or the you didn't give
them enough attention.

345
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,090
He didn't give them the attention that
they deserve,

346
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,070
so they're festering and bouncing around
the inside of your mind and I find that

347
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:38,750
edibles in particular,
it's a very self exploratory experience

348
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,700
and your brain desperately wants to
point out all these areas that it feels

349
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:47,750
that you might've neglected and that's
terrifying for people and he just

350
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:51,720
started really freaking out.
Then not to mention the concept of

351
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:52,380
mortality.

352
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,790
You start thinking about your children's
life and your life and you know,

353
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,430
you get freaked out in there.
Why would you want to do that?

354
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,680
Because I think exploring those things
makes regular life more,

355
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,520
uh,
it makes it more palatable.

356
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,490
It makes it more relaxed.
It makes me,

357
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,520
it gives me a perspective.
It's almost like having a near death

358
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:17,010
experience on a regular basis.
Well,

359
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:19,710
you get out of a near death experience
and one of the things that people say is

360
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:24,000
even if it's a near death experience,
like from a a severe illness or an

361
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:27,240
injury,
you have a perspective enhancement from

362
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:30,210
that and you come out of it feeling
like,

363
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,690
well,
I kind of have a new version of life

364
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:35,490
now.
I understand life now because I

365
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,550
understand the full spectrum.
Before I was operating in this very

366
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,790
comfortable spectrum of everything being
safe and now I realized like,

367
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,970
no,
it doesn't have to be.

368
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,200
Say there can be terrible things where
everything can go wrong,

369
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,820
so appreciate this with much more zeal,
like much more lust for life if

370
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,980
it sounds like what we do in meditation.
Oh my God did.

371
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,320
I was just thinking that.
It sounds like a meditation retreat.

372
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,180
I think they're all connected.
These questions.

373
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,570
Yeah.
You're not even taking.

374
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,320
You don't.
You don't need to ingest anything for

375
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:04,670
all that stuff to start coming up.
In fact,

376
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,170
there's a kind of classic.
There's a classic progression in a

377
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:11,620
retreat or an even in a city.
You could say there are these terrains

378
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:15,070
you move through where first year just
trying to get going and then you're kind

379
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,740
of having all these breakthroughs and
insights and then you can get into this

380
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:20,290
really challenging stage where it's like
you can't meditate.

381
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,860
All your dark stuff is coming up.
Sometimes I think of it as like,

382
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,140
um,
you're exfoliating the brain.

383
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,150
You know,
you just externally eight exfoliate and

384
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,760
a send.
You hit an air pocket of some old school

385
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:35,761
shit like your old shame and your rage
and your childish petulance and,

386
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,300
and it all comes bubbling up and you're
inside this atmosphere and then from

387
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,420
inside that atmosphere you're seeing
everything through that filter.

388
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:47,170
You're now seeing how everything sucks
and your life's a catastrophe or

389
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:50,080
whatever and that's.
And just like you were saying about the

390
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:52,870
body and about the psychedelics and
about the tank,

391
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,070
you got to learn to be okay with your
own uncomfortableness.

392
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,820
You've got to learn to be okay to sit
inside this discomfort and say actually

393
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:01,720
to welcome it,
to say,

394
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,370
well,
this is just part of what's going on

395
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,040
with me right now.
And if you can do that without

396
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,330
resistance,
like you were saying,

397
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,890
without fighting with,
with it,

398
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,120
then it can actually work its way out.
And then you can get into this really

399
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:15,570
beautiful stage of a practice where
it's,

400
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,560
you know,
the equanimity stage they call it,

401
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:20,170
where it's just,
you're really open and available to

402
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:21,850
things.
You're super present.

403
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:25,100
It's not exotic,
you're not in some peak experience where

404
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,943
you're,
you know,

405
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,990
melting in oneness and have an energy
shooting up your spine.

406
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,170
But neither are you in one of these,
you know,

407
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,120
low experiences,
you're just in the,

408
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,710
it's like the beautiful ordinary,
you know,

409
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,990
and those,
those are the.

410
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,740
And you go round and round and those
cycles.

411
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:42,010
And then from actually that beautiful
ordinary place that you can have these

412
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,650
breakthroughs.
And that's the kind of classic place

413
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,810
where people have these shifts,
you know,

414
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,680
they like a no self experience

415
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,730
or a pretty interesting.
The phenomenology of it is really cool.

416
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:55,030
Like there's people described very
specific kinds of things happening that

417
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:59,380
drop them into this next level of our
next progression of insight.

418
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:02,470
You could say,
and I don't want to overstate my

419
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,210
meditative capacities,
but,

420
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,310
um,
I had a,

421
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,930
I would say probably like a Jv version
of what you're describing a last month,

422
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,300
just a few weeks ago,
I was on a 10 day silent meditation

423
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:16,330
retreat and I could see as you described
this,

424
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,600
this progression,
I could see in hindsight that that was

425
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:23,980
what I went through.
So as your mind starts to settle and you

426
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:27,790
get more concentrated,
there are fireworks.

427
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:28,700
You know,
you did the,

428
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,750
you get a lot of sensations in your body
that feel really good.

429
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:34,120
You're seeing things behind your eyes.
Um,

430
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,900
uh,
just the mind releases a lot of dopamine

431
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,480
and Serotonin in response to the reduced
chatter that can happen when you're more

432
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:46,930
focused on what's happening right now as
opposed to caught up being caught up in

433
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,150
the,
in,

434
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,060
you know,
our egoic chatter.

435
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,600
And I,
at one point though,

436
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:56,320
uh,
I,

437
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,250
I hit a stage that's sometimes referred
to as life review where I,

438
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,310
I just,
all the things I'm most ashamed of just

439
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:06,190
started.
I couldn't avoid him.

440
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,200
I couldn't sleep and it was all just
right there.

441
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,670
I was just thinking about them and then
I started questioning the whole practice

442
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:15,190
and what am I doing here is just a waste
of time.

443
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:20,080
And I had a conversation with my teacher
who was a brilliant individual.

444
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:21,640
I mean you could argue,
um,

445
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,380
some have argued and I would agree,
one of the greatest living meditation

446
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:29,080
teachers,
his name is Joseph Goldstein and he's

447
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,840
not a,
he doesn't walk around in robes or

448
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:35,020
anything like that.
He's a Jewish guy from the catskills and

449
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,010
he's in his seventies and he would,
I was staying and he in a cabin and he

450
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:41,260
would pop in and see me in this cabin
every once in a while because it was

451
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:41,920
right near his house.

452
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,850
And He,
one day I was kind of complaining a lot

453
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:50,851
about
the futility of my practice and he said,

454
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,200
surrender.
They said,

455
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:56,320
you got to surrender.
You've got to just stop.

456
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,250
Just stop getting in your head about are
you doing it right?

457
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:03,340
And all that stuff.
Just let the practice do its thing.

458
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,000
As Jeff sometimes talks about it,
it's like lead time in nature,

459
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:10,210
do it's work.
Just trust that the practices we've been

460
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:11,980
doing this for Millennia,
human beings,

461
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,430
it was a reason for that.
Just do the practice and stop worrying

462
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:20,431
about it.
And the next set I had was this kind of

463
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:22,510
equanimity thing that you're talking
about.

464
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:27,511
Where I could see was two hours long.
I could see everything coming up.

465
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,670
All of my urges,
desires,

466
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:32,440
thoughts,
physical sensations,

467
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:35,740
things I was hearing,
things I was seeing was I was very

468
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:38,140
focused.
But at this point it's all just coming

469
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:40,540
at me and I'm not reaching for it.

470
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,790
I don't not pushing it away.
The unpleasant stuff.

471
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,320
I'm not trying to push it away.
I'm not trying to grasp onto the

472
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,120
pleasant and it's just.
And it's,

473
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:51,680
um,
it's like this incredible video game,

474
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,514
right?
Uh,

475
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,760
where you can't.
I sometimes describe meditation.

476
00:23:55,761 --> 00:24:00,590
It's like a video game where you can't
move forward if you want to move

477
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,540
forward.
It's the anti video games and once you

478
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,900
stop wanting,
once you just surrender into this thing

479
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:08,570
where you're just nonjudgmentally
observing,

480
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:11,090
whatever comes up in your mind,
whether it's fear,

481
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,530
whether it's planning,
lunch,

482
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:15,860
whatever it is,
who you just,

483
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:19,550
you can start to move forward and then
the ego comes in and tells you you are

484
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:24,530
the best meditator ever do.
And then you fall for that for a minute.

485
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,110
But then you stop falling for that.
Anyway,

486
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:28,970
at the end of the,
I looked down at my watch and for two

487
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:29,804
hours had passed.

488
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,750
And,
but then I was fully in the zone of

489
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:33,201
like,
oh,

490
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:34,900
this is the end of my next book.
I,

491
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:35,571
uh,
this is,

492
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:37,580
I'm enlightened.
This is the best thing ever.

493
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,750
And I've,
I then a couple of hours later start to

494
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:44,930
realize that I had been telling myself a
story about how amazing I was and how

495
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,550
they should put a plaque up in that
room.

496
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,690
This is where the,
the best meditation sit ever happened.

497
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,570
And,
uh,

498
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,430
the next meditation I went to,
the next time I tried to meditate,

499
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,610
it was as if I'd never meditated before.
And I just like,

500
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,610
I didn't know what I was doing anymore
and it all collapsed.

501
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,250
Wow,
there's so much there.

502
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,680
Um,
there's an experience that you have in

503
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:11,760
the tank where you,
you try to let go and you let go and

504
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,440
relax and then you realize,
no,

505
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:17,520
you just,
there's one layer of relaxation.

506
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,190
Totally.
But they're stacked on top of each

507
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:21,540
other.
There's infinite layers.

508
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,470
And as you get deeper and deeper into
these layers of relaxation,

509
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,840
you hit another layer and you go,
okay,

510
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,370
now this is relaxing.
And then,

511
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:31,290
you know,
there's way more than this,

512
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:35,580
there's way more to this.
And the more you think about the fact

513
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:36,061
that,
oh,

514
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:38,670
now I'm on a new level,
relaxation will now you're not.

515
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,210
Now you're probably two or three levels
above where you were before you

516
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,044
addressed it.

517
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,920
That's the one you were talking to him.
It just seemed like the layers of the

518
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:50,130
onion and just you have to peel those
layers and you're blowing my mind.

519
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,720
This is all the shit that I always talk
about.

520
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,120
It's exactly you're describing.
Exactly.

521
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:55,680
It's the layers of the onion.
You,

522
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,080
it's like you,
you're,

523
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,700
you're holding this fist and you don't
even realize you're holding this fist.

524
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:00,451
You're walking around going,
yeah,

525
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:02,310
everything's fine,
but you're holding this fist and then

526
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,440
you realize you're holding on so tight
and the need first.

527
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,860
You don't even know how to open.
The fist has been closed the whole time.

528
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,700
At some point without.
You have to.

529
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,940
The way you open it is not trying to
open it.

530
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,300
You have to just be so okay with the
fact that you had this tight fist here

531
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,720
and eventually it just opens up itself
and then you think you're free.

532
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,240
And I think if I'd describe it as like
walk in the onion,

533
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,620
you know,
it's like you're walking on top of the

534
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:24,840
annuity and unique.
It's imagined the planet is an onion.

535
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:27,330
You're walking and you're turning the
onion as you walk and you got the huge

536
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:30,150
open air all around you that the
university feel like you're free,

537
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,320
but very slowly you're sinking into the
onion is a layer of tension,

538
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:38,370
is kind of appearing or coagulation.
That starts to kind of coagulate in your

539
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:41,550
experience and eventually realized that
there's this layer of tension here and

540
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:42,960
you're not free.
You're inside this thing.

541
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,040
Then you have to figure out how to

542
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,100
exfoliate that or let that go and it
just keeps going on because it's turtles

543
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:52,740
all the way down.
It's like it's onion layer after onion

544
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:55,230
layer and every time you get into a new
place of freedom,

545
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:59,190
the fact and the act of living is
creating more coagulation.

546
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:03,090
It's creating more just natural
frictions and things that are coming up

547
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:04,500
so it's not just that you're going
through.

548
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,460
So the the progress of insight,
the progress that they call purification

549
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:12,480
in Buddhism is a.
is a process of kind of working through

550
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:15,930
your conditioning but also
simultaneously learning to work through

551
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:20,640
the new conditioning that's accreting by
virtue of just being a human being and

552
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,110
that's,
that's the game.

553
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:24,480
And that's why a lot of people say there
is no end to it.

554
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:28,860
You don't get to some final liberation
because just the act of living is

555
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:30,540
creating its own blind spots.

556
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,100
You know?
So you've got different people in

557
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:35,490
different camps who argue different
things about what real freedom looks

558
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:36,081
like,
but that,

559
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:38,820
that to me seems the most realistic,
you know,

560
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:42,060
at least it's the one that at that fits
with my experience and it describes

561
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,020
exactly how you describe it and you
know,

562
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,540
the two are,
they really line up.

563
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:51,110
I think most of us are operating on
momentum and I think you,

564
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,110
you learn things as a child and those
become,

565
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,150
you know,
whatever your personality is,

566
00:27:57,151 --> 00:28:02,151
the way with whatever thought process
you sort of have carved into your mind

567
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:07,350
like the grooves and patterns that you
normally find yourself thinking in.

568
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,070
And I equate it to a lot to martial arts
training.

569
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,470
Like I,
I used to teach martial arts for a

570
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,760
living.
One of the things that I've found

571
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,910
incredibly difficult was to reteach
people.

572
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,770
It was way easier to teach a person with
no training than it was to reteach

573
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:26,250
someone with poor training.
So when someone has poor training,

574
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,810
they have these paths carved in their
movements and their thought process and

575
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:33,360
when they're in a situation they fall
back on those patterns.

576
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,350
And it's extremely difficult to get
people out of that and learned to do

577
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:40,080
things correctly.
But if you can teach them how to do

578
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:43,380
things correctly from the beginning,
then they naturally grow.

579
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,530
Like this is the stressful situation.
Here comes the problem.

580
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:49,170
Here's the issue.
What's the technique?

581
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,480
Now you know it and it's locked into
your brain.

582
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,480
You know the right pathway,
whether as like don't go to the

583
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:56,190
technique you've been using all your
life.

584
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:01,170
Now use a new technique and and remember
to manage that situation under pressure.

585
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,100
I think that's how most of us are
handling our lives.

586
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,320
We're handling our lives with poor
techniques and poor management skills

587
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:15,540
and and these pads that are carved in
that or infant tile and that are

588
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,920
essentially like the the remanence and
the echoes of when you were a teenager

589
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,180
or even younger than that,
and then maybe your parents and the

590
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,540
learned behavior that you see watching
them and maybe they weren't so good at

591
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:30,990
managing life either,
but these patterns are carved into your

592
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:34,580
brain and you find comfort in them
because you know where they're going to

593
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,680
slide right into them.
And then as an adult,

594
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,920
you start trying to remap your
consciousness and remap patterns,

595
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,250
and in doing that it's very difficult to
sort of re think how you think.

596
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,270
I mean,
I think what you're pointing to here is

597
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,540
close to the,
what has become,

598
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:58,560
for me,
the animating insight of my whole side

599
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:03,561
hustle as a meditation proponent,
which is that the mind is trainable.

600
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,320
Now we are you,
you describe,

601
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:09,480
I think very accurately the ruts in
which many of us find ourselves or don't

602
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:14,400
even know we're in.
But the good news is that there are ways

603
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:18,660
to retrain the mind week.
And I didn't know that until my late

604
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:23,280
thirties when I started reading books
about Buddhism and all the things we

605
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:26,430
want the most calm,
patience,

606
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,840
compassion,
generosity,

607
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,820
happiness,
whatever that means.

608
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,120
These are,
these aren't factory settings,

609
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,050
non negotiable factory settings.
These are skills that can be trained

610
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:40,320
that you can take responsibility for
just the way you take responsibility for

611
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:43,050
your body in the gym.
And there are lots of ways to train

612
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:43,331
them.
We,

613
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:45,270
you know,
Jeff and I obviously talk a lot about

614
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:46,104
meditation,
but,

615
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,760
uh,
you're,

616
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,600
you've talked about other ways to do it
as well from martial arts too,

617
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,840
and there's now been a lot of,
there's a growing body of research about

618
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:56,290
psychedelics as well.
I,

619
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,170
uh,
it was obvious to me from being in the

620
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:00,990
isolation from the sensory deprivation
tank that,

621
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,380
that is a training too.
There are lots of ways to get at it,

622
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:08,550
but the fundamental good news is you
aren't stuck with the patterns that are

623
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:09,450
making you miserable.

624
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,270
Yeah,
you're not,

625
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,250
you're definitely not stuck.
And,

626
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:14,050
um,
I think that all of these things are

627
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:18,520
related and I think that even running,
even a exercise,

628
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:22,630
yoga in particular,
all these things that are difficult when

629
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,990
you do these difficult things,
you're stressing your mind or I should

630
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:28,240
say,
don't be stressing your mind,

631
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,960
exercising your mind and exercising your
body's ability to manage intense

632
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:37,390
situations like yoga poses a very
intense,

633
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,250
especially hot yoga.
It's hard.

634
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:43,180
It's very difficult to very testing and
in doing so you,

635
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,120
you lessen the stress of regular life.
Exactly.

636
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,180
You're,
you're,

637
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,190
you're tied up in a reef knot,
you know,

638
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,010
you can be economists with this
ridiculous pose where you're shaking

639
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:57,010
with exertion than how much more
economists can you be.

640
00:31:57,011 --> 00:31:58,930
How much more present and open can you
be in your life.

641
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,790
It's the same thing.
Do you think most people

642
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,780
bill how to translate what they're
learning in something like.

643
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,940
So for me that was what broke through
about meditation was it was so obvious

644
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:14,140
how to translate what I was learning
with my eyes closed to my life.

645
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,690
Whereas all the other things,
you know,

646
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:18,760
I've been,
I had been running since I was in my

647
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:20,090
teens and,
and while I,

648
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,510
it,
it's absolutely good at staving off

649
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:24,220
depression,
which I've dealt with for a long time

650
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:25,031
and,
uh,

651
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:28,570
and making me feel just generally fit.
Uh,

652
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,100
I don't know that I was explicitly
taking the lessons of running or any of

653
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,920
the other things that many people do
that they sometimes refer to as their

654
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,650
quote unquote meditation now.
And applying it to my life.

655
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:41,270
The way was against so obvious.

656
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,180
Well,
it seemed like the obvious aspects of

657
00:32:43,181 --> 00:32:45,340
meditation are conscious.
Like you're,

658
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:48,160
you're looking for these solutions,
whereas with running,

659
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:51,370
you might be getting them without being
conscious of them or at least getting

660
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,500
some of the benefits of it without being
conscious,

661
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,490
but those benefits would certainly be
enhanced with a different perspective

662
00:32:57,491 --> 00:33:00,370
going into the running,
like going into the running with the

663
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,260
thought process of testing your
consciousness to endure this a very

664
00:33:05,261 --> 00:33:08,140
difficult thing in front of you like
hill running in particular.

665
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,370
Um,
there's,

666
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:13,570
there's something about anything that's
like very uniquely physically stressful

667
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:16,480
like that which requires the mind to
stay the course.

668
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,760
And in doing so,
especially in the other end,

669
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:22,060
once you come out of it,
there's this great feeling of euphoria

670
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:25,420
and peace and it's not just a physical
release of energy,

671
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:29,920
but it's also an understanding that the
brain has exercised the demons that are

672
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:33,100
responsible for the anxiety while you're
overcoming this stressful

673
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,280
and the limits you told yourself were
there.

674
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,271
It's funny,
you know,

675
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:36,900
my,
my,

676
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,180
my wife and I've been doing a lot of
soul cycle,

677
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:42,460
which I know my wife does it too,
but you don't,

678
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,340
you don't do it with her.
But I,

679
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,980
I have other shit to do because I'm a
better,

680
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,750
I'm a better husband and Joe Rogan,

681
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,960
uh,
so although in my,

682
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:52,700
she's,
she's out in the green room right now

683
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:56,390
raging against me because she's,
she's angry because that I'm not at soul

684
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:58,760
cycle right now that I haven't said what
I'm about to say,

685
00:33:58,761 --> 00:34:00,560
which is that I'm the one who got her
into it,

686
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:02,330
so,
so in her defense.

687
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,450
So,
but they are often giving these,

688
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:10,710
the teachers are often giving these
really sort of affirmations from the

689
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:13,520
front of the room.
And uh,

690
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,730
my traditional approach to those is to
completely ignore them as incredibly and

691
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:22,520
irretrievably annoying.
And however,

692
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,740
what they're saying is what you're
saying,

693
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,680
what they're saying is pedal through
your resistance,

694
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:31,250
your telling yourself a story that you
can't turn the knob up to the right

695
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:33,020
right now,
the resistance knob to the right right

696
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:35,990
now,
and stay on the beat and sprint and do

697
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,370
all the Greek.
You're telling yourself a story.

698
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:39,080
You can't do it,
but you actually can do it.

699
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:43,010
Try it.
Try it to get over the limiting stories

700
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:44,630
you're telling yourself.
And in fact,

701
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:46,820
yesterday morning when we did soul
cycle,

702
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,430
that guy at the end said something I
normally would have ignored,

703
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:53,870
which was next time somebody proposes
something to you that you tell yourself

704
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:55,580
you don't want to do,
do it.

705
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:01,270
Hence the sensory deprivation tank.
Direct link to what he said to my being

706
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:05,510
willing to do it.
So there's some there,

707
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:05,720
there.

708
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,060
Yeah.
There's something about things like soul

709
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:09,850
cycle,
even if the right.

710
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,130
Even if the motivational speech rings
true,

711
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:14,240
you want to like,
fuck,

712
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:17,990
this
is the problem with spiritual teachers,

713
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,030
right?
It's a problem with somebody who's,

714
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,520
or anybody who walks around that it has
the answer.

715
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,410
And that's.
And it's an.

716
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,920
And often the answer can be this sort of
pollyanna ish,

717
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:32,570
a Disney channel thing that may,
maybe it probably is true on some way,

718
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:35,600
but it's just the delivery of that kind
of certainty.

719
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:36,850
That's so annoying.
I

720
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,033
say that my,

721
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,540
my,
uh,

722
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,910
you know,
there are millions of meditation books.

723
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,920
The only thing new about the books that
I write is that I add the word fuck a

724
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:47,970
lot.
And,

725
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,550
and,
and that is a,

726
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:51,690
uh,
just a new way to talk about this stuff

727
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,120
because our tendency,
or at least guys like us,

728
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:56,760
I think where people like us,
men and women like us,

729
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:01,970
is to some people when you hear,
when you hear this kind of affirmation

730
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,180
uttered,
you reflectively rejected,

731
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,880
which is again normal,
but if you can just say it to people and

732
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:11,760
fresh language,
it's the reason why these things are

733
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:15,090
cliched,
is because they're true and they become

734
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,610
cliche through sort of mindless
repetition.

735
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:19,320
But if you can find new ways to
articulate them,

736
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,850
they can land.
I think also whether it's your book on

737
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,970
meditation or anybody,
just life experiences that they're,

738
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:31,770
they're writing down.
We gather information from other

739
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:34,710
people's life experiences in a very
unique way.

740
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,070
And that's one of the reasons why people
really enjoy autobiographies.

741
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,260
It's one of the reasons why people
really enjoy,

742
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,580
just truly reflective introspective
thinking because we,

743
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,170
we can pick out little gems in our self.
So even though you might be talking in

744
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:54,450
your meditation book about things that
other people have talked about in

745
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:57,000
meditation books,
you're talking about it from your unique

746
00:36:57,001 --> 00:37:00,930
personal experience and when someone
reads that or here's you say it,

747
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,020
you get something tangible out of that.

748
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:04,680
Well,
we,

749
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,410
we talk a lot about,
um,

750
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,470
so my favorite comedian of all time,
other than Joe Rogan is Dave Chappelle.

751
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:12,360
And you,
uh,

752
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,370
you came on my radar screen because you
were on a show,

753
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,900
uh,
the Chappelle show back in the and the

754
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,050
fear factor bit he did years and years
ago,

755
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:24,580
which was one of the funniest things
I've ever seen a and Chappelle in one of

756
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:26,920
the seasons.
Jeff and I were talking about this last

757
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,600
night as a matter of fact,
talked about,

758
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,410
um,
how he was doing one of these outtake

759
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:34,180
episodes.
I can't remember which season was in

760
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,750
because they only did two and a half.
He was doing an outtake episode and at

761
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:41,950
the beginning he did a riff about how
back in the day African American

762
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:44,830
communities never got the good part of
the pig to eat.

763
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,750
The white people.
Got the good parts of the pig,

764
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,920
so,
uh,

765
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:52,921
the African Americans had to figure out
how to make good food out of snout and

766
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,480
that's he said what this episode is
going to be,

767
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,030
we're going to take the snout and we're
going to make good stuff out of it.

768
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,900
And my approach to writing books about
meditation is the snout is the good

769
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:03,940
stuff.
The embarrassing shit that happens to

770
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:06,460
you when you were,
when you're meditating is the good

771
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:09,310
stuff.
It is what will allow people to see what

772
00:38:09,311 --> 00:38:11,740
the practice does for you.
So I take the worst,

773
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:15,910
most embarrassing stuff that happens and
talk about it because that is gives you

774
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:19,480
a front row seat at what training the
mind actually looks like.

775
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:22,300
And if you can't have a sense of humor
about how crazy you are,

776
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,940
you are truly fucked.

777
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,150
I think that those uncomfortable moments
are so important for other people to

778
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:30,984
hear about it.
Yes,

779
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,550
yes,
absolutely.

780
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,980
We need to know we're not alone.
Yes.

781
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,130
All our madness.

782
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,290
What was it like on the set when you
were working with Dave Chappelle?

783
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,580
It was great.
Well,

784
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:42,610
I've known Dan for a long time.
I was actually on the very first episode

785
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:47,850
we by chance I was walking through New
York and I saw dave and this was before

786
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:50,170
the show had.
Even Beth.

787
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,690
I didn't even know it existed,
but I rented a Bobcat Goldthwait who's

788
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,050
there and I'm like,
what's up man?

789
00:38:55,051 --> 00:38:56,050
What are you guys do?
And he's like,

790
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:56,741
he goes,
oh,

791
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:59,440
hey joe,
we're doing a TV sketch man,

792
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:01,240
you want to be in on it?
And I go,

793
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:03,370
I only have like 20 minutes.
I'm on my way to a meeting.

794
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:04,540
He goes,
here he goes,

795
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,840
we're handing out Britain's for New York
boobs,

796
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,970
and he,
I had a box,

797
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:14,110
so it's me and him walking through
Manhattan and he's got this crazy fake

798
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:17,350
mustache on and he's like,
you've got the best New York boobs,

799
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:19,210
and he would give someone like a ribbon
for heaven,

800
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:19,960
New York boobs.

801
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,080
And it was really silly but fun.
And so I was like,

802
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:24,190
well,
Dave's got a show.

803
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,390
And then turns out it's the greatest
sketch show in the history of the world.

804
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,720
And a year later he calls me up again
and asked me to do this thing for.

805
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,160
They wanted to do a fear factor sketch
with tyrone Brigham's.

806
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,420
Yeah.
So that's me and him.

807
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,850
A fresh faced Joe Rogan and Dave
Chappelle.

808
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,703
The.
Yeah.

809
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,290
Well this is.
What year is it?

810
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:43,763
Three.
Four.

811
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,220
Yeah.
I think it's before that.

812
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,590
Is it.
I think it's before that.

813
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:50,110
I want to say it's 2002 maybe.
Yeah.

814
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,950
Because,
uh,

815
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,760
I wasn't even doing the mantra back then
and I was doing that in 2003.

816
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,070
So I think it's 2002.

817
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,940
The fear factor bit is one of my
favorite season two,

818
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:01,870
if I recall.
I think so,

819
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,150
yeah.
And is really one of the,

820
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,110
at one of the funniest bits in a show
that is,

821
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,830
I would argue perhaps the greatest
television show of all time.

822
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,770
I think it's the greatest sketch comedy
show of all time.

823
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,413
Something bigger.

824
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,770
It's hard to say that though,
because if you boiled down a lot of the

825
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:23,470
all time great shows,
like in living color or some of the

826
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,390
other ones,
boy,

827
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,850
they had so many seasons.
If you boiled them down to two seasons,

828
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,250
maybe there will be some,
but he's got some sketches that worst

829
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,250
just groundbreaking,
like the black white supremacist who was

830
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:37,084
blind.
Yeah.

831
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,160
What about.
I was watching last night because jeff

832
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:42,480
and I were talking about Chicago last
night,

833
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,940
so on the car ride home from this event
we did together,

834
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,180
I was watching black Bush,
which was another I think unbelievably,

835
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:53,190
which released season two where he plays
George w dot Bush,

836
00:40:53,191 --> 00:40:57,450
his version of Georgia and all the
rationales for going into the war in

837
00:40:57,451 --> 00:40:59,790
Iraq and it's unbelievably funny.

838
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,310
Yeah,
he's a genius.

839
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,000
He's a real comedy genius,
but also a guy who's.

840
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,380
You wouldn't get it if you just sort of
see him do standup,

841
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:13,370
but he's deeply introspective,
like very intensely.

842
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,710
Well thought out.
You know he's not.

843
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,880
He's not a surface guy by any stretch of
the imagination.

844
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,790
I love them.
I really do.

845
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,610
I keep thinking that show's going to
come back at some point.

846
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,610
I'm sure

847
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,770
his is.
Netflix specials are better.

848
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:33,810
I've seen him unfucked with in.
Unless Netflix let them do a Chappelle

849
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:37,010
show where they just left him alone.
Then it will be genius,

850
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,770
but that was the problem in season three
set.

851
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,420
I know it was.
He was.

852
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,750
They were telling him what to say.
They were telling them there is so much

853
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:49,040
money involved that they were trying to
get him to slightly watered down his

854
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:52,010
content in order to make it more
palatable for advertisers.

855
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,800
They were asking him,
does not say the n word.

856
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,250
There was a lot of behind the scenes
nonsense that I dealt with the exact

857
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:04,730
same administration and comedy central,
so I'm well aware of how silly they were

858
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,180
about certain things.
They had these corporate ideas and this

859
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:12,010
was also right around the same time
Janet Jackson's nipple popped out there

860
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,660
in the street ball,
which fucking oddly enough,

861
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:15,740
changed everything.

862
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,640
People started freaking out about
content because of a nipple.

863
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:20,520
Yeah,
it was.

864
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,420
It was very.
It was a very weird time for television

865
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:28,220
and in their defense what they do is
they're producers.

866
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,320
They're not.
They're not creative people.

867
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:35,321
They're executives and they didn't know
how to handle how to keep it funny and

868
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:41,420
keep it free and loose,
but also figuring out a way to make it

869
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:44,360
fit into what their corporate structure
is of what's acceptable and not

870
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:48,380
acceptable for advertising.
So it was just a clusterfuck of control

871
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,560
and neediness and too many cooks in the
kitchen and people's ego where there's a

872
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:57,680
lot of people that just want it to
affect the show just so that they can

873
00:42:57,681 --> 00:43:01,280
put their greasy fingerprints on it and
that's a really common thing with

874
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:04,400
television that that ego aspect of,
you know,

875
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:09,401
these different people who are high up
on the food chain in the executive world

876
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:13,940
wanting to put their stamp on a show and
then talking openly about putting their

877
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:14,270
stamp.

878
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,230
Well,
that was my idea.

879
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:18,980
I thought it was really important.
We get dave out there like that and it

880
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,701
for him.
He was like,

881
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:21,980
fuck this,
I'm going to Africa for a couple months

882
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:23,630
and I'm just going to come back and
quit.

883
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,640
And everybody was like,
whoa.

884
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,040
But that's who David is.
I mean,

885
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:28,874
that's,
that's.

886
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,040
There's not a lot of people that walk
away from $50,

887
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,050
million dollars,
but he's one of them.

888
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:35,120
He's just like,
I don't need to do this.

889
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,440
I could.
I could do something else.

890
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:40,190
I just do stand up,
and he in fact we even weirder,

891
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:43,130
he didn't do standup for a long time and
when he did it,

892
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:46,340
he did it for free.
He would just show up places like he

893
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:50,510
would show up places with a speaker and
plug it into a microphone and a park in

894
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:52,460
Seattle and just start doing standup.

895
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,760
There was a lot of stories about like
people would just gather around hundreds

896
00:43:55,761 --> 00:44:00,170
of people and he would just be doing
standup for these random people and they

897
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,100
were like,
what's going on?

898
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,490
How does a guy get to be like that?
Just be yourself.

899
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,040
That's who he is.
But was that you think,

900
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,270
is that something.
I mean because that sounds to me like

901
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:12,410
somebody who had a practice or something
or like or an inner compass that was

902
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:15,010
smoked a lot of weed that maybe that was
part of it.

903
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:19,750
He smokes weed all day.
I mean if you watch this new netflix

904
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:23,600
specially smoking a vape pen through the
entire special to the point where I

905
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:25,550
watched it in like 40 minutes of the
special.

906
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:26,840
I started getting anxiety.
I'm like,

907
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,670
how high are you right now,
man?

908
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:30,920
When you said you might,
will you hide your Netflix?

909
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:32,160
But yeah.

910
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,230
Yeah,
because you said at the beginning you

911
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:35,580
were baked and I was like,
is that a bit or is it.

912
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,970
No,
I was high but I didn't keep getting

913
00:44:37,971 --> 00:44:41,330
high through this special.
Like Dave keeps hitting that vape pen

914
00:44:41,331 --> 00:44:43,040
and I don't know how strong that vape
pen is,

915
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:44,600
but he's like seven,
eight,

916
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:47,620
nine,
10 hits deep in 40 minutes in.

917
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,710
I'm like,
Yo,

918
00:44:48,711 --> 00:44:51,230
this kid gets super slippery.
Yeah.

919
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:55,880
He just kept pulling out this vape pen.
Yeah.

920
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,290
I mean it was literally with him through
the entire set in his hand.

921
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,690
That's increasing the degree of
difficulty to this that I would not want

922
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:07,930
to explore.
That's what an isolation tank.

923
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,741
Yeah,
exactly.

924
00:45:08,741 --> 00:45:09,540
That's a.

925
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,510
But it also,
it's freeing in a way because you're so

926
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:15,800
comfortable that experience of like
giving into the,

927
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,940
to the marijuana,
like giving into the,

928
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,940
the,
the thc where you just sort of like

929
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:23,690
float away on it and don't question it.
Yeah.

930
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,560
But as you were high backstage getting
ready to do your netflix special and I

931
00:45:26,561 --> 00:45:29,260
would imagine that's a pretty stressful
environment because they're taping this

932
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:30,910
thing.
It's going to be your special.

933
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:33,760
It's a big deal.
Did you not have a moment of like,

934
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,860
Holy Shit I shouldn't have,
I shouldn't have smoked?

935
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,240
No,
no,

936
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,380
no.
It's fun.

937
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,510
It's just like,
this is like an incredibly privileged

938
00:45:43,511 --> 00:45:46,240
position.
I find myself in like this whole thing

939
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:48,790
is amazing.
So crazy wild ride.

940
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:54,060
So I'm about to do the wildest part of
the wild ride film a Netflix special and

941
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:55,240
uh,
just,

942
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:56,140
just,
just joy,

943
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,840
just taking it all in and then going.
This is so like,

944
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:03,100
all the hard work is done.
The materials in place,

945
00:46:03,101 --> 00:46:06,120
the writing has been done,
the rehearsals been done,

946
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:10,180
has been hundreds and hundreds of sets.
Everything's tightened up and all the

947
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:13,300
notes are in place.
And I've run it 100 times.

948
00:46:13,301 --> 00:46:17,150
And by the time you saw the film,
the Netflix special,

949
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:21,770
it was mostly the fourth show of for
taping.

950
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:25,810
So I've already taped three taping so
I've already got it in the can.

951
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,720
So there's.
Most of the pressure is off so it's just

952
00:46:28,721 --> 00:46:29,850
like a regular show on.

953
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,510
Okay.
Yeah.

954
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,690
So it's just just happiness.
Just let it,

955
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,990
let it happen.
Now you seem happy while watching it.

956
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,490
It was fun.
Yeah,

957
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,300
it's a good time.
But it's one of those weird things where

958
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,060
you know,
stand up,

959
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,040
live standup is,
is weird itself because you know you're

960
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:55,270
dealing with all these factors,
the people's consciousness.

961
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,210
You're,
you're trying to manage your material as

962
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:02,030
well as bring them in and make sure that
your timing is right and everything is

963
00:47:02,031 --> 00:47:05,350
smooth.
And then on top of that there's the

964
00:47:05,351 --> 00:47:10,351
filming aspect of it.
Like this will be locked in and recorded

965
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,490
forever.
Like this is,

966
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:16,540
this is going to go online and then
people will have copies of it and then

967
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:18,580
it will be.
This is,

968
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,220
this is your material,
this is your thought process.

969
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:26,260
Do you have this iron down?
Do you have this edited and parsed and

970
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:29,050
sectioned and have you thoroughly
examined?

971
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,010
Have you used

972
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,110
the correct economy of words?
Have you.

973
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,160
Have you boiled it down into the best
possible version of itself?

974
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:39,280
So funny with standup because you watch
it as a as A.

975
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,160
Because I've never done standup.
You watch it as a consumer.

976
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,650
It looks casual,
it looks off the cuff,

977
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,230
it has enormous amount of work that goes
into it,

978
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:52,320
but it's both casual and off the cuff
and incredibly well thought out and

979
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,770
rehearsed and it has to be both of those
things but don't you have to.

980
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,200
So you prepare like crazy,
you know you got that,

981
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:02,650
but then when you're actually there,
isn't there a certain amount of having

982
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:06,130
to let go and try and be actually
responsive to what's happening in the

983
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:08,620
audience to a.
That must be the skill.

984
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:10,990
It's like you do the preparation so you
can almost let go of.

985
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,340
Yeah,
this both,

986
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,200
you know,
like you have to be prepared but you

987
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:19,201
also have to be loose and you have to be
completely engrossed in what you're

988
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,330
talking about,
but also in the moment.

989
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,283
Yeah,
yeah,

990
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,610
yeah.
It's tricky,

991
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:29,320
but the bottom line is when it's done
it's worth it.

992
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:33,160
Like all the weirdness of like when you
get it done or something like triggered.

993
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,720
When it was done,
I finished it.

994
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:35,650
I was like,
I did it.

995
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,660
Like this is what I wanted to do.
Like I wanted to,

996
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,740
I wanted to accurately represent a real
live standup comedy set that feels like

997
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,030
any other set that you could catch me in
San Francisco on a Saturday night.

998
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,970
And so it was that.
So it's all worth it.

999
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,350
Yeah,
it felt like that.

1000
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,210
Yeah.
So then I waited about a year,

1001
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,690
then I start doing it again and now I'm
in the process.

1002
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,980
A couple more months I'll do it again
now.

1003
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,990
It sounds a lot like actually the
experience of teaching you're teaching

1004
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,940
meditation sort of like because you got
to be,

1005
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:10,750
you kind of got to know you have to have
experienced and sort of know your stuff,

1006
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:13,870
but the other hand you actually got to
be super open to exactly what's coming

1007
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:17,650
up and what someone's describing or
what's happening and you've got to be.

1008
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,960
And so if you.
If you try to bear down too hard on

1009
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:22,150
that,
then you're just going to be repeating

1010
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:25,140
your own shit back again.
So can you be a.

1011
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,660
had that total openness to actually see
what it is that someone is saying and

1012
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:30,880
not have not have your.
Put your projections on it,

1013
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,390
but you have to have also done your
homework in a way and it's just having

1014
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:37,900
that balance and then there's that
really this beautiful thing where you're

1015
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:40,120
kind of.
You get into flow when you're kind of in

1016
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:45,100
the zone and it just like you hardly
even know the words are coming out or

1017
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:48,130
responses happening and it's not.
It's not remotely deliberate at all,

1018
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,920
but it's the right thing in that moment
or the right thing that someone needed

1019
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,800
to hear or you needed to hear and it
feels incredible.

1020
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:57,670
It feels like it feels effortless,
but it's the effortlessness that comes

1021
00:49:57,671 --> 00:50:00,070
out of preparedness.
Previous effort.

1022
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,881
Yeah.
Yeah.

1023
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:02,800
You have to have both.
You can't just wing it,

1024
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,390
right?
You have to be prepared,

1025
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,890
but you also have to be able to just be
flexible in the moment and to be able to

1026
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:09,720
ride the.

1027
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,390
It comes back to the word that we
started with his surrender.

1028
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,670
Yeah,
and I noticed this a lot because I do a

1029
00:50:14,671 --> 00:50:19,560
lot of traveling around and giving
speeches and I'm always about meditation

1030
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:21,150
and I'll have my little shtick that I
do,

1031
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:26,151
but then I will open it up for questions
and actually the same thing is true for

1032
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:30,860
when I'm live on good morning America.
You know where I have to.

1033
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,580
If I'm in my head,
if I'm thinking about what I should say

1034
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:38,900
or how things should go,
I make the worst mistakes.

1035
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:43,580
If I can get myself to surrender and
just be there.

1036
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,850
I've been playing with that a little bit
even in the course of this discussion,

1037
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,860
uh,
as a big podcast.

1038
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:49,880
Don't screw it up.
Say that.

1039
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,650
Don't say that they'll do the dumb thing
that,

1040
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:52,191
you know,
whatever,

1041
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:52,620
blah,
blah,

1042
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,900
blah.
Actually,

1043
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:58,370
if I can just like,
let all of that chatter go away,

1044
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,690
play itself out.
Then you have a better conversation.

1045
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,990
Then you say the thing that you couldn't
have planned.

1046
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,210
Yeah,
that is the art of the podcast is the

1047
00:51:09,211 --> 00:51:14,040
art of conversation in general is to get
out of your own way and to be able to

1048
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:17,400
also at the same time find the right
words,

1049
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,840
articulate the right thoughts,
figuring out the right way to the piece,

1050
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:25,320
the sentences together.
So it's both entertaining and engaging

1051
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:30,170
but also rings true and there's not a,
an,

1052
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:34,140
a,
an air of bullshit to it or a ego to it

1053
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:35,730
or you know,
because people can.

1054
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,460
There's a unique thing about a
conversation,

1055
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:42,720
especially with people interacting with
each other that people they tune in to

1056
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,120
like.
And I tune into it like if I listen to

1057
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:48,510
certain conversations with people that I
find awkward and I'm like,

1058
00:51:48,511 --> 00:51:50,010
well,
what is uncomfortable about this?

1059
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:51,330
What is this weird?
And see it.

1060
00:51:51,331 --> 00:51:55,530
A lot of times it boils down to like one
person trying to be too much in control.

1061
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,580
Absolutely that.
Yeah.

1062
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:57,414
Or yeah,

1063
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,950
personally I'm usually that person.

1064
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,320
Yeah,
everybody is.

1065
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,510
And you can tell when you're hanging out
with that person because it's like

1066
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,240
there's this grippiness or,
or when I have that,

1067
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,300
it's like your study,
fearful usually word and you're,

1068
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:11,360
you're trying to hold onto the narrative
and it just creates this unnatural nus.

1069
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,960
Yeah.
And then everyone's got a little bit,

1070
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,460
it feels a little bit weird and then
someone's trying to overcompensate with

1071
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:19,790
someone over here and it just wrecks the
whole flow of it.

1072
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,350
You know,
when I first started reading a little

1073
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:21,690
bit about that

1074
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,490
Zen Buddhism,
which one of the flavors of.

1075
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,230
They talk a lot about spontaneity.
Yeah.

1076
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,660
Yeah.
And it didn't quite zen bounced.

1077
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:32,310
I didn't quite get that,
but this is what we're talking about

1078
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,300
actually.
If they also use this word freshness,

1079
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:41,510
that if you can get rid of the stale
planned canned stuff and just touch in

1080
00:52:42,721 --> 00:52:45,060
on what's happening right now,
which is fresh,

1081
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,000
uh,
than the spontaneity arises.

1082
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,180
Can I?
There's um,

1083
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,890
uh,
so I got a teacher,

1084
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,690
this Guy Shin Zen young,
who I think is the,

1085
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,410
the fucking bomb.
You've got to get them on.

1086
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:56,570
This is amazing.
He is incredible.

1087
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,510
He is truly amazing.
He's a super nerd consciousness and he

1088
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:04,590
is really articulate about the dynamics
and he's trained a lot within the zen

1089
00:53:04,591 --> 00:53:08,860
tradition but also in kind of old school
theravada like the more strict sue's

1090
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,520
name,
s h I,

1091
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,670
z e and Canadian,
sorry,

1092
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:18,540
z e and Shin Zen young.
And he actually likes Ms Dot Martial

1093
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,210
Arts and he guides people while watching
mixed martial arts in his undershirt.

1094
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:22,710
And he's the,
he's the wicked too.

1095
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,270
Yeah,
I,

1096
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,880
I can fully that.
Yeah.

1097
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,250
So

1098
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:26,851
he,
uh,

1099
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,570
but he talks a lot about something
called the zen bounce because he's,

1100
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,050
he's interested in how,
like,

1101
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:32,090
how,
you know,

1102
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,440
how do these different practices from
different traditions work?

1103
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,620
Like how do they,
what is the way in which they for you or

1104
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:40,590
they reduce your suffering and and
because they can look so different on

1105
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:44,250
paper or actually inexperienced,
so you might have one kind of meditation

1106
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:45,540
tradition.
It's all about just sitting with your

1107
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:48,270
eyes closed,
not moving all about that kind of

1108
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:52,440
stoicism and then you when you do move,
it's very slow and deliberate and you

1109
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:56,070
got to be mindful and all that stuff,
but then you have other traditions like

1110
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:59,340
within a certain kinds of schools where
you're actually.

1111
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,350
If you it's frenetic.
It's like go,

1112
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:02,250
go,
go all the time.

1113
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:04,260
You're moving fast.
You're like unwrapping your shit and you

1114
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:06,210
put your shit back together and you're
eating your food in a particular kind of

1115
00:54:06,211 --> 00:54:07,890
way and you got to get to this thing
over here and you gotta get this thing

1116
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:10,080
over here and then you got to sit next
to stop on a dime.

1117
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,310
And what they're doing is they're
deliberately shaking things up there.

1118
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:19,290
Deliberately creating all this agitated
and energy to teach you how to ride the

1119
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:23,480
energy to teach you how to be calm
enough in the center that you can add

1120
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:26,580
that energy turns into spontaneity,
turns into creativity,

1121
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,430
turns into genuine being available in
the moment.

1122
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:32,400
This as opposed to being stuck in some
way.

1123
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,150
That's what's getting trained.
And when you see these guys from those

1124
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:38,790
monasteries are from those traditions
who are really,

1125
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,660
who practice a lot,
they've got this bouncy available,

1126
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,370
turn on a dime,
do this,

1127
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:45,630
you know,
it's like they're just available to

1128
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:48,130
what's going on because they've trained
that quality in their experience.

1129
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:50,250
It's gotten out of their own way.
They've gotten out of their own way.

1130
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:50,940
I mean,
and they would,

1131
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,860
I mean Shin Zahn when you talked to how
he is,

1132
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:54,091
he,
you know,

1133
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:57,300
I've had like hundreds of hours of
discussions where I'll call him up,

1134
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:58,080
I'll be like.

1135
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,760
And He,
the best thing about him is he'll answer

1136
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:01,920
the phone if he's ready to talk,
he's ready to serve,

1137
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:03,120
you know,
whatever you got going on.

1138
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,130
I'll be like a column in the morning,
Shins in.

1139
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:07,980
So what's going on right now?
What's your experience of consciousness?

1140
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,680
And he basically describes,
you know,

1141
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:14,010
it's like he's just there and it's like
he's sort of part of this upwelling of

1142
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,590
the world and it's all kind of vibrating
up through him.

1143
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,970
He has no center,
you know,

1144
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,610
he asked him where his center.
He experiences the center of himself.

1145
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,670
Sometimes it's over here,
sometimes it's over on the right and

1146
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:24,361
he's just like,
yeah,

1147
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:26,010
it's just,
it's all reality.

1148
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,260
Just this free flow of reality that he's
just responding to now and then.

1149
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:34,020
And then he'll tell me this is the shit
that would blow my mind.

1150
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,341
Cause you're like,
okay,

1151
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:36,060
that sounds awesome.

1152
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,751
But he's like,
no,

1153
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:39,530
there's challenges for him.
The challenge is,

1154
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:44,570
is taking condition seriously,
taking condition seriously.

1155
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,510
He has to convince himself that went to,
you know,

1156
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,020
that the stakes are high enough that he
should work on this thing or that.

1157
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:53,730
Yeah,
I guess I should go to the way that bus.

1158
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,661
You know,
it's like,

1159
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:56,520
I mean he will because his instincts
kick in,

1160
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:59,880
but it's like he's so in the uncondition
that,

1161
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,510
you know,
he,

1162
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:03,300
his danger is just becoming one of those
dudes sitting on a mountain and not

1163
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:06,450
doing anything but the world is fucked
and it needs people like him who can

1164
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,770
help us out.
So he,

1165
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,130
he,
and he's very inspired to,

1166
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,450
to,
to try to do his best to be a great

1167
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:14,790
meditation teacher.
But that's his battle.

1168
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,870
He's no longer so most practitioners,
their battle is trying to get to taste

1169
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:21,840
that more unconditioned quality,
the spontaneous,

1170
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:24,460
that free the yourself as just a
process.

1171
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,721
Uh,
his,

1172
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:26,531
his,
the other direction.

1173
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:30,340
He's gone so far into that now he's
trying to remember what it was like to

1174
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:33,460
be a human being.
He's more like a cosmic rock,

1175
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,130
like there's the vibrating into infinity
all the time,

1176
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:40,420
which is great for stress but not so
great for maybe other things.

1177
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,490
Very interesting.
Yeah.

1178
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,680
So he's just been doing this for so long
that she is very high level of.

1179
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:49,750
He's another Jewish guy from this case,
from Los Angeles.

1180
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,500
He was born in the forties or fifties,
Eisenhower,

1181
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:56,260
America,
and he basically was way into Japan,

1182
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,090
Japanese culture,
learn Japanese as a teenager.

1183
00:56:59,091 --> 00:57:04,091
I went to Japanese school and then went
to Japan when he was like 19 or 20 and

1184
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:06,710
decided he wanted to study these.
Uh,

1185
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,810
some of the Zen practitioners eventually
got in with a,

1186
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,630
uh,
uh,

1187
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,520
what's called the Japanese have Adrianna
school.

1188
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,560
So it's sort of a particular school of
Buddhism.

1189
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:17,440
Started training with them and then that
was never finished.

1190
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:20,320
He was getting a phd program.
Do hardcore stuff like that.

1191
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,930
You have an ice baths and things like
that?

1192
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:23,830
Yeah,
yeah.

1193
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:25,270
I mean,
so it's all what we're talking about,

1194
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,270
building up resilience building and back
when emily,

1195
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,610
can you sit in these seriously?
I mean they do the in Japan they do the

1196
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:32,350
thing called,
he'll talk about this.

1197
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:37,351
The marathon monks were basically these
guys sit for like no joke for days on

1198
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:41,380
end days not going to the bathroom,
not moving,

1199
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:42,940
not eating,
not drinking water.

1200
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,860
I mean,
it's hard to imagine how it would even

1201
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,410
be possible,
but apparently it's a televised event on

1202
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,660
in Japan.
Like they do these long walks and then

1203
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:54,130
they do these sets and these guys,
it's all about what shinzen would say.

1204
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,670
It's about recycling the reaction,
so it's all about your hub,

1205
00:57:57,671 --> 00:58:00,040
these responses in your body,
you're feeling uncomfortable,

1206
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:02,620
you're feeling hungry,
you're feeling this stuff,

1207
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:06,790
but if you can bring enough equity and
openness to those sensations,

1208
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:09,940
then they just.
And I had this happen to me thousands of

1209
00:58:09,941 --> 00:58:12,760
times meditating or the sensation just
boils off.

1210
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,480
It just goes from being pain in your
need to just vibrating,

1211
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:19,180
feels like maggots squirming and then it
just wouldn't,

1212
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,490
it just.
And it's all about how,

1213
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:26,410
how completely present can you be.
You can metabolize anything stuck and

1214
00:58:26,411 --> 00:58:29,140
guess what?
You can metabolize stuck physical stuff

1215
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:31,510
too.
So if you put your attention on a knot

1216
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,220
in the back of your,
you know,

1217
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:34,450
in the back of your shoulder or
something.

1218
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:37,960
I've had to experience in meditation
where I'm just feeling this tension in

1219
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:41,770
my body and I just hold my attention
there long enough and this sort of,

1220
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:42,840
oh,
in this open way,

1221
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,020
not trying to make a change.

1222
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,670
Just curious about it.
Looking at it.

1223
00:58:45,671 --> 00:58:49,570
I've had the experience of knots,
like desolving were like an actual

1224
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,120
impingement or a physical thing that
seemed to change.

1225
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,370
Now that's really weird because then you
realize,

1226
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:55,750
wow,
look the mind,

1227
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,150
the mind and body,
it's all part of one process,

1228
00:58:58,151 --> 00:59:00,220
you know,
and at part of what was keeping that

1229
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,770
tension,
there wasn't just the problem in the

1230
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:04,480
muscle.
There was some part of me that was

1231
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:06,490
keeping it there.
There was some way in which I was

1232
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:09,520
holding onto it a little bit,
like holding my breath a bit,

1233
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,380
you know,
or like when you said about releasing

1234
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:15,040
layers of tension and you sit down on a
meditation cushion and you think you're

1235
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:18,250
relaxed and you realize you're actually
kind of uptight and you're like,

1236
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,200
and then you let go of that and then you
and you said a little bit more than you

1237
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:26,201
realize there's another layer of tension
and you can just let go and let go and

1238
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:27,800
let go.

1239
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,350
And it just seems to go on and on and
on.

1240
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:31,730
And it's like,
that can be.

1241
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:34,250
I mean there's some.
I know another teacher only teaches is

1242
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:36,110
lying down.
She teaches people,

1243
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,130
Reggie Ray,
go to a Dota,

1244
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,180
go to his meditation,
resets.

1245
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:40,820
You just,
you're laying on the ground.

1246
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:42,320
You're not doing anything.
You could fall asleep,

1247
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:45,470
doesn't matter for a month.
He just laying on the ground and he's

1248
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:48,620
teaching you how to actually land on the
ground.

1249
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,150
You could spend a week,
two weeks learning how to actually lay

1250
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:55,350
on the ground.
You think you're laying on the ground

1251
00:59:55,351 --> 00:59:58,610
where you're still a little bit tense.
You're still a little bit holding

1252
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:02,060
yourself up in some way and it's like
you're just letting go of those layers

1253
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:04,730
and letting go of those layers until
you're just like a pool.

1254
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:09,140
It's funny because everyone,
we all know that we need conscious

1255
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:09,974
awareness.

1256
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:15,580
We need the to be here and present,
but also that thinking of conscious

1257
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:22,751
awareness and the control that we try to
enact on our environment and all the

1258
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,840
different ways that the ego forces us to
think and pushes us and nudges us.

1259
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,900
He really is about getting out of your
own way.

1260
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,370
In a lot of ways,
like it's a paradox to because the only

1261
01:00:37,371 --> 01:00:41,450
way to truly surrender to reality is to
not fucking care.

1262
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,120
It's absolutely true,
but,

1263
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,450
and that's what's going to free you up
to be the most effective in your caring.

1264
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,820
You cannot get around that head fuck
because it is.

1265
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,470
Absolutely.
That is absolutely true.

1266
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,650
You know,

1267
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:55,530
so we would,
I mean this is the thing that people

1268
01:00:55,531 --> 01:00:59,070
really struggle with because a lot of
people here will hear everything you

1269
01:00:59,071 --> 01:01:03,830
just said and you know,
and all this stuff about Shinzen,

1270
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,790
you know,
not caring and think,

1271
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:06,720
okay,
if I meditate,

1272
01:01:06,721 --> 01:01:09,180
well I'm going to be ineffective.
I'm not going to be able to do it.

1273
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,890
But that's what I'm saying is the
paradox.

1274
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:13,500
It's like the person who's most
effective as the person who gives up

1275
01:01:13,501 --> 01:01:16,800
needing to be effective.
It's like you because that's how you

1276
01:01:16,801 --> 01:01:19,320
free up all the energy.
It's like if you're trying to control

1277
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:21,510
everything all the time,
you're going to be really limited in

1278
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,990
what you can actually do.
If you just let go and let things be as

1279
01:01:24,991 --> 01:01:26,370
they are,
you're kind of like,

1280
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,250
it's like you're conserving all this
deep,

1281
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:31,950
deep well of energy that's there and
then when you really do need to make a

1282
01:01:31,951 --> 01:01:35,460
move because it does fucking matter,
then you've got the energy to act and

1283
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:38,490
you act in a way that's probably more
effective because it's less distorted,

1284
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,210
so it's just skillful use of energy and
that's actually,

1285
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,720
that's what I've learned from practice
and even from getting older because I'm

1286
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:47,970
46 now and I don't have the energy I
used to have.

1287
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,030
It's like choosing your battles and
didn't seem like now I'm like,

1288
01:01:51,031 --> 01:01:53,280
that seems really tiring.
I'm not going to do that.

1289
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:56,700
I'm going to actually just sit here and
chill and relax so I'll have the energy

1290
01:01:56,701 --> 01:01:58,440
to do what I need to do when I need to
do it.

1291
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,800
That's kind of that maturity is sort of,
I think a big part of the.

1292
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,980
The meditative like learning.
Well,

1293
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:08,820
so it's so interesting what you're
talking about as well as it relates to

1294
01:02:08,821 --> 01:02:11,020
like how when you're on good morning
America,

1295
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:15,600
like just sort of figuring out a way to
just be in the moment and guide the

1296
01:02:15,601 --> 01:02:18,210
conversation,
but don't think too much about what

1297
01:02:18,211 --> 01:02:20,010
you're saying,
but say the

1298
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,780
right things and have poignant things
and good questions and being able to

1299
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:29,250
engage but not being too conscious of
how it sounds or what you're trying to

1300
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:33,180
achieve by your words or the image that
you're trying to portray.

1301
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:34,390
It's,
it's.

1302
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:39,330
There's so many parallels that would
exist in standup comedy of that exist in

1303
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:42,360
podcasting.
They exist in martial arts like when

1304
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:46,800
you're doing martial arts.
That's a big part of being able to train

1305
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:51,801
effectively is to focus almost entirely
on the movements themselves.

1306
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:57,660
To have them trained into a way where
there a pathway that you can almost

1307
01:02:57,661 --> 01:03:01,860
observe like you.
You're the observer and a passenger.

1308
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,100
As much as you're the driver of the
experience that it's all just sort of

1309
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:09,090
taking place and when you start tweaking
and freaking out about it,

1310
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,470
that's when everything tightens up and
that's when you start to run into all

1311
01:03:13,471 --> 01:03:15,420
these real issues with training.

1312
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,530
Well,
that's why I find basic.

1313
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,700
You know,
we've talked a lot about.

1314
01:03:18,701 --> 01:03:22,480
Jeff has talked as he always does,
very beautifully about deep end of the

1315
01:03:22,481 --> 01:03:25,000
pool,
you know,

1316
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,630
mysticism and highly attained
meditators,

1317
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:29,860
but the,
the,

1318
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:35,470
the nuts and bolts,
basic application of beginners,

1319
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:40,630
mindfulness meditation,
which Jeff and I talk about is what

1320
01:03:40,631 --> 01:03:43,960
allows you to get out of your own way.
Because saying to people,

1321
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:45,100
Hey,
get out of your own way.

1322
01:03:45,101 --> 01:03:47,830
Get Out of your head is a very
frustrating thing to hear because you're

1323
01:03:47,831 --> 01:03:49,770
like,
how the hell do I do so?

1324
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:52,740
But the basic,
the basic move of,

1325
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:55,420
of what?
Of of beginner meditation,

1326
01:03:55,421 --> 01:03:59,260
which is to sit with your eyes closed.
Bring your full attention to the feeling

1327
01:03:59,261 --> 01:04:03,040
of your breath coming in and going out,
and then as soon as you try to do this,

1328
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:04,590
your mind is going to go bonkers.

1329
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,780
You're going to start thinking about,
you know,

1330
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:08,050
what's for lunch,
where do I need a haircut,

1331
01:04:08,051 --> 01:04:09,370
where did dribbles run wild,
blah,

1332
01:04:09,371 --> 01:04:10,204
blah,
blah,

1333
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,690
and the whole game is just to notice
when you've become distracted in a

1334
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:16,360
nonjudgmental,
friendly way.

1335
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,800
Oh yeah,
that's anger.

1336
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:19,690
That's random thoughts,
whatever.

1337
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,650
Let it go.
Go back to the breath over and over and

1338
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:27,970
over ad Infinitum,
and that basic bicep curl for your brain

1339
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,710
allows you to have a less hostile
relationship to your inner chaos,

1340
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,060
allows you to see it clearly,
and that is the mechanism by which all

1341
01:04:37,061 --> 01:04:39,670
have for me,
at least by which all of the things

1342
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:41,650
we're talking about here.
You're not freaking out on live

1343
01:04:41,651 --> 01:04:45,460
television being able to survive in a
sensory deprivation tank when you think

1344
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:49,450
Joe Rogan my judge you for freaking out
and jumping out all that stuff.

1345
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:53,500
It allows you to see the chatter arise.
This basic move that we're doing in

1346
01:04:53,501 --> 01:04:56,080
meditation,
which is just sitting back and allowing

1347
01:04:56,081 --> 01:04:59,170
all of this stuff to come up without
trying to grab it or push it away,

1348
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,280
can help you in the things that we're
talking about here.

1349
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,990
Martial arts,
standup comedy,

1350
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:06,580
all of the things.
So,

1351
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,710
uh,
can I just say something about what,

1352
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:12,190
where it turned a corner for me when I
was practicing because I was terrible

1353
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,730
meditator.
Um,

1354
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,690
and it was,
it was understanding the actual skills

1355
01:05:16,691 --> 01:05:17,980
that we're.
And that's

1356
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,040
the thing I think that links all what
we're talking about here.

1357
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:24,430
When you talk about martial arts,
when you talk about being a broadcaster

1358
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:26,530
and you talked about comedy,
talk about practice.

1359
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:32,070
It's like there are particular kinds of
mind body skills that we're training and

1360
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:34,570
those skills are actually.
They have names.

1361
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,930
There's a feeling of that that's
happening that you can experience when

1362
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:40,960
you're training that muscle group.
And that was when I started

1363
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:43,510
understanding things that way because
the Shin Zen because he talks about it

1364
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:45,010
that way,
but Buddhism talks about it that way.

1365
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,610
What the factors of awakening that
you're building up concentration,

1366
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,060
which is your capacity just to pay
attention to what you want to pay

1367
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:53,410
attention to.
It's like a commitment.

1368
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,210
Your mind wanders,
you bring it back.

1369
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:58,000
That's one skill.
You're building up clarity,

1370
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,910
which is your ability to be clear and
make the sermons,

1371
01:06:00,911 --> 01:06:03,900
but what's happening in your experience,
what's happening in a social experience?

1372
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,380
Is this the right time to say this
thing?

1373
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,980
What's happening inside me,
like what am I really feeling and versus

1374
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,530
how my acting,
you know like so dialing up that

1375
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:14,020
resolution dial and building up
equanimity,

1376
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:19,060
which is just the can actually not fight
with my experience as it's unfolding.

1377
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:22,510
Can I have this centeredness in the
middle of what's going on?

1378
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,970
Whether I'm doing martial arts,
whether I'm doing comedy,

1379
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:29,240
whether I'm doing meditation,
the beauty of meditation practices,

1380
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:33,700
it makes explicit what those skills are
in a simple situation with your eyes

1381
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:35,440
closed.
You can notice when you're being

1382
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:36,760
concentrated,
when you're being clear,

1383
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:38,320
when you're being honest with you,
being friendly,

1384
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:41,680
which is another good skill,
like you notice when that's happening

1385
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,230
and because you notice when it's
happening,

1386
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,270
you can start to notice how to apply it
in every other area of your life,

1387
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,220
so that's all it is.

1388
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:53,170
All practices is about being explicit
and deliberate about what qualities of

1389
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:57,190
existence of being that you want to
train in your life and then you just try

1390
01:06:57,191 --> 01:06:59,830
to apply it everywhere,
and so that's why you can get people who

1391
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:01,690
are.
I see them as basically meditation

1392
01:07:01,691 --> 01:07:06,220
masters on a comedy stage or people who
are basically meditation masters in the

1393
01:07:06,221 --> 01:07:08,030
sports arena or in the,
in a,

1394
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:11,560
in a cage match or whatever it is.
They're applying the same principles.

1395
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:15,240
So all these are paths that can bring
you into more of a,

1396
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:19,570
a more presence in your life.
And the problem comes when people

1397
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:20,010
started saying,
no,

1398
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:21,760
but my path was a good path.
Oh yeah,

1399
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:23,680
but I teach meditation.
That's more fundamental,

1400
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,171
or no,
no,

1401
01:07:24,171 --> 01:07:24,491
no,
no,

1402
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:26,520
but I do a body practice.
This is more fundamental.

1403
01:07:26,521 --> 01:07:30,760
It's like it's about the skills.
Those are what's fundamental.

1404
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:31,990
Yeah.

1405
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,540
Yeah.
And the more you can concentrate on

1406
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:36,520
that,
the more you'll enjoy this weird

1407
01:07:36,521 --> 01:07:38,740
experience.
The mystery of this.

1408
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:42,550
It's this weird experience that doesn't
have an owner's manual.

1409
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:43,750
Yes.
Do it.

1410
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:47,170
That's one of the things that's always
freaked me out about the mind and the

1411
01:07:47,171 --> 01:07:48,910
body.
It's like you have this incredible

1412
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:53,911
vehicle and this amazing resource that's
sort of operating this vehicle and no

1413
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:57,730
one,
no one gets a manual and you're taught

1414
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,270
how to handle it by people that don't
know what the fuck they're doing,

1415
01:08:01,271 --> 01:08:05,410
whether it's teachers in school or
whether it's the kids that you grow up

1416
01:08:05,411 --> 01:08:08,890
with or maybe even perhaps your parents
or sports coaches.

1417
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:13,870
You get shitty operating advice.
They're grinding the gears and banging

1418
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:16,100
into trees and no one knows how to
handle this

1419
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,290
thing.

1420
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:18,240
Correct.
Particularly in our culture.

1421
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,113
You know,
I mean,

1422
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:22,620
one of the points that Sam Harris mutual
friend of ours,

1423
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:26,100
great podcasts are great writer,
has made in his book waking up,

1424
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:30,450
which was one of his many books,
but I think my favorite is that,

1425
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:33,590
you know,
in the West we've developed an

1426
01:08:33,591 --> 01:08:37,830
intellectual and scientific culture that
is really robust and as changed the

1427
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:42,831
world and is in unquestionably valuable,
but in the east they actually were

1428
01:08:43,711 --> 01:08:46,710
working on the owner's manual for the
mind for Millennia.

1429
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:50,790
You know,
you got to Buddha statues in here 2,600

1430
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:53,100
years ago,
this guy,

1431
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,860
if he even existed or what do we don't
we don't know,

1432
01:08:55,861 --> 01:09:00,861
but this culture of Buddhism and before
that the Hindus were working on how do

1433
01:09:00,961 --> 01:09:03,930
you operate this mind?
What is this mind?

1434
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:07,410
And uh,
I think the beautiful thing we're

1435
01:09:07,411 --> 01:09:11,490
watching now globally,
this trend is the meeting of these two

1436
01:09:11,491 --> 01:09:14,370
things and jeff is one of the people is
most excited about.

1437
01:09:14,371 --> 01:09:16,110
This is partly why we're such good
friends.

1438
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:21,240
The meeting of this western scientific
rational culture and this eastern

1439
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:22,710
exploration of the mind.

1440
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,190
But birla I want to just call you on
something like I think,

1441
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:30,030
I think that's absolutely true,
but I also think these,

1442
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:31,770
the,
these,

1443
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,620
this understanding,
this way of thinking about it is there

1444
01:09:34,621 --> 01:09:37,800
in the West as well,
that it's like the east is made it

1445
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:41,550
explicit in very particular ways.
But even within humanistic traditions,

1446
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:43,870
if you look at like the,
some of the Greek philosophers who are,

1447
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:46,650
a lot of them are really mystics.
If you look within the abrahamic

1448
01:09:46,651 --> 01:09:48,480
traditions,
there are,

1449
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,470
these understandings are there as well.
And they're describing it in similar

1450
01:09:52,471 --> 01:09:56,490
ways and like you hang out with some bad
ass Catholic priest who spent his entire

1451
01:09:56,491 --> 01:10:00,300
life like in poor neighborhoods,
helping people out and like totally

1452
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:05,570
being present and working on service and
at the way in which that human being has

1453
01:10:06,211 --> 01:10:10,170
learned how to survive and is learn how
to flourish and learn how to be present

1454
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:14,280
for his community or her community.
It's a lot of the same skills and did

1455
01:10:14,281 --> 01:10:16,110
not.
There's obviously shadowy aspects

1456
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:18,110
everywhere too.
But you know,

1457
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,230
these are human universals.

1458
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,050
That's right.
And there's a book,

1459
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:24,590
there's just to being a bad ass priest.
There's a book called Tattoos on the

1460
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:26,230
heart,
which was written by the guy who wrote,

1461
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:30,710
ran homeboy industries here in la.
And He,

1462
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,960
as far as I know,
doesn't have any meditation practice,

1463
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:37,430
but he talks about it.
This is a bit of a sappy word,

1464
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:38,750
but compassion,
you know,

1465
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:42,650
at actually giving a shit about other
human beings about whom very few other

1466
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:45,320
people give a shit.
And his whole life is the organizing

1467
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:47,540
principle is taken care of.
These gang members,

1468
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:48,690
uh,
who's,

1469
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:51,560
who have had,
who've been discarded by their family's,

1470
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:55,880
grown up with parents who were in
prostitution or drugs or whatever and

1471
01:10:55,881 --> 01:11:00,881
had no shot and this guy,
his whole life has given them a shot and

1472
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:04,850
if that's not a living this stuff out,
then I don't know what it is.

1473
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,050
Why do we think compassion is the sappy
word?

1474
01:11:07,051 --> 01:11:10,260
I'm just wondering because I know that
it's so common to have those responses.

1475
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:11,550
Like what does that do you think

1476
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,130
problem with that we were talking with
soul cycle before,

1477
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,963
you know,
when they,

1478
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,010
it's the presentation,
you know,

1479
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:19,920
when you eat it,
it's through repetition.

1480
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:23,070
It loses its meaning and then sometimes
you get the sense,

1481
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,970
I get the sense at least they would.
The people who were saying this to me

1482
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:28,440
have no idea what it is they're saying
or why.

1483
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:29,590
Yeah.
The Co op,

1484
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:34,860
they're clunky now.
They're just a signaling their tribal

1485
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:39,740
allegiance to a Unicorns or something.
By just repeating these phrases are

1486
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,640
really embodying what they mean or
something.

1487
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,020
Right.
Like the people that say that,

1488
01:11:43,021 --> 01:11:44,580
I'm not religious,
but I'm spiritual.

1489
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,750
Yeah.
Right.

1490
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:49,530
And they say that you let go Christ.
On the other hand,

1491
01:11:49,531 --> 01:11:52,290
I hear that I just hear somebody who's
trying to connect these principles and

1492
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:55,710
doesn't want to necessarily identify
with some of these structured forms of

1493
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:56,820
religion that,
that are,

1494
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:01,200
that all these fucking problems.
Sometimes it's that and sometimes it's

1495
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:04,440
just weird people that are just making
noises with their face because they want

1496
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:06,260
you to think a certain way about that.

1497
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:10,480
Making noises with your face.
But now thing that people do where

1498
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,080
they're just really just saying noises
that they,

1499
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:17,310
they hear other people say and they're
not connected to them and you feel

1500
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:19,710
they're not connected to them.
So you just kind of waiting it out.

1501
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,930
So it's hypocrisy.
The hypocrisy that makes you want to

1502
01:12:21,931 --> 01:12:24,510
puke because it's a disconnect between
what's real,

1503
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:25,620
which.
Because you know it's real because you

1504
01:12:25,621 --> 01:12:27,540
can feel their body language and then
what they're saying,

1505
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:29,400
which is the opposite.
But even when it's real.

1506
01:12:29,401 --> 01:12:31,140
I mean,
this was my problem when I first started

1507
01:12:31,141 --> 01:12:33,030
getting into meditation.
Even when it's real,

1508
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:35,250
there's an earnestness,
there's a lack of sense.

1509
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:40,251
If there's a sadness,
a saccharin about the presentation of

1510
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:43,200
these really fresh,
amazing,

1511
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:45,180
invigorating ideas that,
that I,

1512
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:46,680
I,
this is why I wanted to write a book

1513
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:49,740
with you because you talk about these
things in ways they got me interested as

1514
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:54,741
opposed to sometimes the preciousness,
it's precious and I had this beautiful

1515
01:12:55,381 --> 01:12:57,530
little box that I'm going to unfold for
you and it's like,

1516
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:00,870
and it's so holy and perfect and it's
just like this whole thing around just

1517
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:03,240
makes me want to fucking vomit as soon
as they get anywhere near it.

1518
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:06,360
Yeah.
It's like certain yoga teachers can say

1519
01:13:06,361 --> 01:13:11,361
the exact same thing and it's calming
and when they say no a you say it back

1520
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:13,470
you totally.
Exactly.

1521
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,030
And then the other ones say,
I like,

1522
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:17,880
will you please shut the fuck up buddy?
So I have a,

1523
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:23,300
I have a trainer that I work with,
this bad ass woman named jade.

1524
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,820
Jade Alexis,
who was a former j dot j dot Alexis,

1525
01:13:26,821 --> 01:13:30,390
former golden gloves boxer.
And she's just,

1526
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,580
I,
I would take spin classes from her,

1527
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,510
not like just straight up spinning
classes.

1528
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,430
You would just get in your face.
Turn up your resistance dial for you

1529
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,450
while you're in the middle of a sprint
is just a total bad ass and so I started

1530
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:45,540
working with her one on one.
She is the first person who got me to do

1531
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:49,290
yoga because when she says not mistake,
I'll say it right back to her.

1532
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

1533
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,640
I used to take yoga from this guy from
South Africa.

1534
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:58,410
He was amazing and he would say all the
things that you would hate most coming

1535
01:13:58,411 --> 01:14:01,830
out of insincere people,
but you knew he really believed it and

1536
01:14:01,831 --> 01:14:05,970
he also was one of the rare guys and
I've ran into a few people that do this,

1537
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:10,971
that run a donation only yoga class,
which was fascinating for because I

1538
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:12,304
would watch these

1539
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:17,580
people pull in in a Mercedes and not
donate and take classes for free and

1540
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:20,290
leave and I'm like,
this is amazing.

1541
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:24,520
It's amazing to watch like how many
people take advantage of that and it's

1542
01:14:24,521 --> 01:14:28,120
amazing that the concept of it is the
purest expression of yoga.

1543
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:30,220
You can get totally like give what you
can.

1544
01:14:30,221 --> 01:14:31,660
I'm not gonna charge you anything.
I'm not.

1545
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:35,860
That's not what this is about,
this is about the yoga itself and if

1546
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:38,800
people contribute enough,
I can continue to do this and we could

1547
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:43,801
pay the rent and he managed to keep the
place open that way because he was so

1548
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:45,280
good and it was so real.

1549
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,230
Many meditation teachers operate this
way,

1550
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,520
many of them.
That's how the CCO nation owning.

1551
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,110
Yeah,
it's great if it could work,

1552
01:14:53,111 --> 01:14:53,630
right.
It's.

1553
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,960
That's how kind of it should be.
Yeah.

1554
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:58,540
We have A.
I have a group in Toronto called the

1555
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:02,740
consciousness explorers club that my
friend James and I started like eight

1556
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:07,020
years ago or something and we try to do
that principle and the idea is that

1557
01:15:07,021 --> 01:15:10,930
every week we get together and we
explored it and practices and we

1558
01:15:10,931 --> 01:15:12,700
explore.
Then we do a part two so we might,

1559
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:16,720
which is like a social practice or
interactive or body practice and the

1560
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:20,170
whole thinking is basically like we want
it to be kind of one stop shopping.

1561
01:15:20,171 --> 01:15:22,720
That whoever you are,
whatever your background and how much

1562
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:25,000
money you have,
you can come once a week to this place

1563
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,490
and it will cost you nothing.
If you have no money,

1564
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:28,390
it'll cost you.

1565
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,490
The sliding scale is 10 to 20.
If you have money,

1566
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:34,090
you'll get the absolute best of what we
can do with guest teachers.

1567
01:15:34,091 --> 01:15:36,490
You know,
every Monday is a different set of

1568
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:39,580
programming and that's.
And that's what we'll do and we'll do

1569
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:41,050
that as much as we can for you and it's
like.

1570
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:44,320
And then you can go home and do go back
to your life and if you need referrals

1571
01:15:44,321 --> 01:15:49,060
for more help there potentially there,
but this idea that once a week anywhere

1572
01:15:49,061 --> 01:15:51,250
in any community in the world,
you can just go to a place where you

1573
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:54,850
could get the best and it's affordable.
There's no reason that can't happen

1574
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:58,690
because there are so many skilled
practitioners out there and teachers and

1575
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:02,080
facilitators and different modalities
and it's just exploding across the board

1576
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:05,560
like psychotherapies,
exploding meditations exploding like

1577
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,610
body therapy based therapies are
exploding like insights about a house,

1578
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:11,470
sports,
how sports work,

1579
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:13,060
how the mind body works,
exploding.

1580
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:16,090
So there's all this diet stuff,
movement stuff,

1581
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,700
all this expertise out there and it just
needs to way.

1582
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,390
We wanted to create a framework where we
could start to channel some of that

1583
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,530
expertise,
you know,

1584
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,530
get together and have an adventure,
explore what this particular modality

1585
01:16:26,531 --> 01:16:28,890
has to say and then and then do it all
in communities.

1586
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:31,210
You get that community support.
Yeah.

1587
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,280
Well I think that's good with
everything.

1588
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:35,280
I think having these shared

1589
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:39,910
differences and sort of relating,
what are the hiccups that you found

1590
01:16:39,911 --> 01:16:42,400
along the way?
What are the pitfalls?

1591
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,520
How have you overcome those?
There's,

1592
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:49,170
there's great value to that.
Whether it's in meditation or we use

1593
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,690
that in comedy a lot.
There's a lot of like one of the great

1594
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:56,470
things about communities like the comedy
stores that we get together and talk

1595
01:16:56,471 --> 01:17:00,310
about the pitfalls like yeah,
I'm in the middle of the set and I'm on

1596
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,200
the,
on some of them in my own head and then

1597
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:05,620
I'm realizing this bit's kind of clunky
and I'm trying to get out of it and

1598
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,311
like,
ah,

1599
01:17:06,311 --> 01:17:08,990
what do you do?
Like a group therapy for sure.

1600
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,550
Yeah.
There's a lot of that.

1601
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:14,660
Like one of the things that's really
interesting about standup in general

1602
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:18,200
today as opposed to in the past,
is that the consciousness of it is sort

1603
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:20,600
of shifted.
In the past,

1604
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:25,601
it used to be a very solitary pursuit
and everybody was sort of fighting in a

1605
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:30,430
scarcity mindset.
There was a famine thinking mindset that

1606
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:33,080
there's only a certain amount of slots
on sitcoms.

1607
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:37,040
There's a certain amount of host jobs
for late night talk shows and there's

1608
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:39,890
only certain amount of jobs are comics,
certain amount of clubs to work at.

1609
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:45,020
Well now there's so many clubs to work
at so many theaters on top of the clubs.

1610
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:50,200
There's all these internet places where
you can do podcasts and there's so many

1611
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:55,841
different avenues that comics don't feel
this famine mindset anymore and it's

1612
01:17:56,931 --> 01:17:59,600
much more of an open and supportive
community.

1613
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:02,300
Do you think that in part is driven by
the fact that there are more women in

1614
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:05,750
comedy as well and they they,
they can sometimes bring a little more

1615
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:06,650
civilized approach?

1616
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:10,190
No,
I think that's true that they do do that

1617
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:11,480
in a lot of ways,
but no,

1618
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:13,700
that's not what it is.
I think it's a lack of scarcity,

1619
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
it's structural and it's also more
people who have meditated,

1620
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:22,640
who have explored their consciousness,
who,

1621
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:27,730
who are aware of the pitfalls of the ego
entering into comedy and then more

1622
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:32,840
people sort of fostering that idea of
community through.

1623
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:33,330
Yeah,

1624
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:36,480
I was surprised there.
I know a reasonable amount of comedians

1625
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:40,560
and some of them have come on my podcast
today to talk about how meditation helps

1626
01:18:40,561 --> 01:18:43,680
them in what they do.
Millennials in particular,

1627
01:18:43,681 --> 01:18:44,370
it's great.
Yeah.

1628
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:46,350
Really good.
Very funny and very nice guy.

1629
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:50,040
You kind of realized that the comic,
the comic is kind of like the canary in

1630
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:53,700
the coal mine because the comedians are
really sensitive,

1631
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,530
right?
I mean that's kind of part of what it

1632
01:18:55,531 --> 01:18:59,250
means to be a comedian is to be
sensitive to noticing cues and

1633
01:18:59,251 --> 01:19:01,830
subtleties and things in the culture
that other people overlook,

1634
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,260
so it's not okay.
Because what I hear you saying is it's

1635
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:06,150
almost like some of the most,
like,

1636
01:19:06,151 --> 01:19:09,750
I hate this word,
but evolved or mature people out there.

1637
01:19:09,751 --> 01:19:12,460
Professionals in the world are creative
people in the world or people in that

1638
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:16,620
comedy community because they had that
sensitivity and they've had to learn how

1639
01:19:16,621 --> 01:19:18,750
to work together in some way.
I mean,

1640
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:20,250
it's an interesting.
Maybe they're like,

1641
01:19:20,251 --> 01:19:21,900
there's something we could learn from
that population,

1642
01:19:21,901 --> 01:19:23,970
you know,
if we look around and saying who can we

1643
01:19:23,971 --> 01:19:26,070
learn from?
Is there something in Comedians and the

1644
01:19:26,071 --> 01:19:29,510
way they're doing things that other
people can learn from and what and what

1645
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:30,840
is it?
Can we distill those lessons,

1646
01:19:30,841 --> 01:19:31,391
you know?
Well,

1647
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:32,100
I think a lot of,
a lot of

1648
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,390
ways it's an exploration of the mind,
you know,

1649
01:19:34,391 --> 01:19:36,250
and I think comedy is an exploration of
the mind,

1650
01:19:36,251 --> 01:19:40,270
not just in your own mind but also in
how do you relay those thoughts to other

1651
01:19:40,271 --> 01:19:42,220
people and the most efficient way
possible.

1652
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:47,380
And a lot of that has to do with how
much have you managed your own mind and

1653
01:19:47,381 --> 01:19:52,330
your own ability to communicate and
meditation can greatly assist you in

1654
01:19:52,331 --> 01:19:54,450
that regard.
Do you do any meditation?

1655
01:19:54,451 --> 01:19:55,284
Yeah,
I meditate.

1656
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,100
What's your practice like?
Well,

1657
01:19:57,101 --> 01:19:59,770
I do a bunch of different things.
One,

1658
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:04,720
I do a lot of yoga,
breathing exercises and do them by

1659
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:08,940
myself were essentially just completely
concentrating on the breath,

1660
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,570
just breathing in and breathing out and
forcing out all the thoughts and

1661
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:17,310
allowing them to come in and then
allowing them to leave and I like to do

1662
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:20,970
that also inside the tank,
like one of the things that I really

1663
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:25,971
like to do is get myself into a position
where I've settled in the tank and then

1664
01:20:26,581 --> 01:20:31,581
just completely concentrate on my breath
and just just concentrate entirely on

1665
01:20:32,011 --> 01:20:35,970
the breathing in and breathing out and
get it into this almost like hypnotic

1666
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:38,760
cycle of breathing in and breathing out.

1667
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,910
And it's the same thing.
There's going to be all these different

1668
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:42,880
thoughts.
Like a,

1669
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:43,651
you know,
I'm itchy.

1670
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:45,830
I should scratch my nose.
And I'm like,

1671
01:20:45,831 --> 01:20:48,660
uh,
maybe I should cut this down to an hour

1672
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:51,480
instead of two hours like I planned or
you know,

1673
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:54,120
I really need to go running instead of
going to yoga tomorrow,

1674
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:56,610
maybe I should switch.
You got to let those go.

1675
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,150
They come in,
they come out and just the breathing

1676
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:03,510
being this consistent thing that I can
always go back to concentrating on.

1677
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,090
Yeah,
I mean that is,

1678
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,750
that's it you just described.
I do a practice almost exactly like

1679
01:21:08,751 --> 01:21:12,020
that.
It actually enhances the tank.

1680
01:21:12,021 --> 01:21:12,831
Well,
it's interesting.

1681
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:16,730
I was just going to say that I was
trying to figure out what I was noticing

1682
01:21:16,731 --> 01:21:18,800
my breath,
like what am I noticing here?

1683
01:21:18,801 --> 01:21:20,320
Um,
I might actually feeling the breath or

1684
01:21:20,321 --> 01:21:25,321
might just hearing the breath come in
through the nose and just identifying

1685
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:27,050
that was actually a little bit
interesting.

1686
01:21:27,051 --> 01:21:30,770
It actually boosted my level of
attention to the breath when I decided

1687
01:21:30,771 --> 01:21:32,000
to go in that direction.
Yeah,

1688
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:32,834
it's,

1689
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,021
it's both.
I mean,

1690
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:35,400
you're hearing it,
you're feeling it,

1691
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,740
but it's just the act of it,
you know,

1692
01:21:37,741 --> 01:21:40,620
the thing that doing it,
they're doing it and they're like this

1693
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:45,830
sort of like hypnotic in and out thing
that happens when you have no sensory

1694
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:49,440
input whatsoever.
You're not feeling your feet on the

1695
01:21:49,441 --> 01:21:50,850
ground.
You feel weightless.

1696
01:21:50,851 --> 01:21:52,860
You're not hearing anything and not
seeing anything.

1697
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:56,970
It's just a particularly effective
environment for exploring your.

1698
01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:01,410
There's an expression sometimes this
feeling of our inexperience of being

1699
01:22:01,411 --> 01:22:03,390
breezed,
so it's like you're not.

1700
01:22:03,391 --> 01:22:06,330
You're no longer doing the breathing.
The breathing is just happening.

1701
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,570
It's like you're being breathed by a
giant cosmic lung.

1702
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:12,780
It's like that,
that you know,

1703
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:16,920
that feeling that you're talking about
letting go try to do that in the tank

1704
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,250
and it's just like you.
You just let go of any sense of that.

1705
01:22:20,251 --> 01:22:23,910
There's a dewar and it just that you
just start to taste yourself as this

1706
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:27,030
process,
this thing that's just happening,

1707
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:29,340
you know in a bird is passing outside.

1708
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:33,160
Clouds are passing and someone's walking
across the street talking on their phone

1709
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:38,161
and you're being breathed and it's all
just one system that's just happening.

1710
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:41,050
It's also interesting too,
when I'm in the tank,

1711
01:22:41,051 --> 01:22:45,540
I lose the sense of what is up and
what's down here.

1712
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:49,330
Like you lose like what?
When you're lying there and you're

1713
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:51,280
floating,
you kind of lose this.

1714
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,620
Everything seems like all over the
place,

1715
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:57,700
but in the thought of relaxing and
letting go,

1716
01:22:57,701 --> 01:23:00,250
it's always going down.
It's always like a deeper thing.

1717
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:03,490
It's always like settling in more,
settling more.

1718
01:23:03,491 --> 01:23:06,010
It always seems to go towards back,
like you're

1719
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,190
just sinking in deeper and deeper and
deeper.

1720
01:23:09,191 --> 01:23:12,820
It's one of the only times we have a
sensation of a very particular direction

1721
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:13,480
that you're going in.

1722
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,930
I found that direction,
listening of it that initially was quite

1723
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:21,760
scary for me that I was aware it,
but my moving or is this inner ear

1724
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:22,850
stuff,
you know,

1725
01:23:22,851 --> 01:23:26,080
like it was just flying.
But,

1726
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:28,690
but I,
I didn't experience that as a soaring.

1727
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:31,150
I experienced it as more terrifying.
Do we,

1728
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:35,710
do we do we have footage of Dan Klein
the inside of the tank?

1729
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:37,840
It's a practice,
man.

1730
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:38,231
I,
I,

1731
01:23:38,231 --> 01:23:40,810
I see the value.
I mean,

1732
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:45,100
another thing that actually kind of
reminds me of my last meditation retreat

1733
01:23:45,101 --> 01:23:46,990
where we're talking about physical
discomfort.

1734
01:23:46,991 --> 01:23:50,050
My teacher and I and because I was
experiencing a lot of physical pain from

1735
01:23:50,051 --> 01:23:53,560
long sitting for a long time,
pain comes up and I was asking,

1736
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:55,870
you know,
is it okay for me to quit at some point

1737
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:58,240
just because it's pains too intense?
And He.

1738
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,650
Joseph was arguing,
you know,

1739
01:23:59,651 --> 01:24:02,290
I think you want to test your limits on
this.

1740
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,150
Obviously at some point you're going to
get up,

1741
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:05,880
but you want to,
we're,

1742
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:10,930
we're gradually increasing the amount
that we can stand and that to me seems

1743
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:16,870
very similar to the value that I can
perceive of getting back in the sensory

1744
01:24:16,871 --> 01:24:21,871
deprivation tank of being able to be
with that fear a little bit more,

1745
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:25,510
test the limit a little bit more
consistently so that I'm a so that my

1746
01:24:25,511 --> 01:24:26,620
world isn't getting smaller.

1747
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,410
People echo that same sentiment when it
comes to psychedelics.

1748
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:33,140
Right?
That was the next test for belonging,

1749
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,470
very interested.
There's a lot of,

1750
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,310
as you know,
there's been a growing body of research

1751
01:24:38,311 --> 01:24:42,630
into the salutary effects of
psychedelics and a lot of it's being

1752
01:24:42,631 --> 01:24:46,170
done at Nyu on cancer cancer patients
who have anxiety,

1753
01:24:46,171 --> 01:24:49,710
but there's also some specific work
being done at Johns Hopkins on

1754
01:24:49,711 --> 01:24:52,530
meditators and uh,
and psilocybin.

1755
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,490
What kind of effect to psilocybin have
on meditators and in Kenya in a way,

1756
01:24:56,491 --> 01:25:00,420
show them directionally where you want
to be moving in your meditative

1757
01:25:00,421 --> 01:25:03,600
practice.
And I've had a longstanding desire to

1758
01:25:03,601 --> 01:25:08,601
get into this study,
my shrink and my wife strongly argue

1759
01:25:09,151 --> 01:25:12,420
that I shouldn't.
Somebody with my kind of brain chemistry

1760
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:14,970
who had,
has to go on and perform under pressure

1761
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,190
when the red light's on,
on TV.

1762
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:20,820
Probably not a great idea to dose myself
with psychedelics,

1763
01:25:20,821 --> 01:25:22,590
but this is something that I've been
wrestling with.

1764
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,390
What are you worried about?
What that looks like?

1765
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:28,380
What do you think is gonna happen is
right back to the.

1766
01:25:28,381 --> 01:25:30,720
My worries in the tank.
And Timmy,

1767
01:25:30,721 --> 01:25:32,940
I was thinking a lot about psychedelics
and I've had,

1768
01:25:32,941 --> 01:25:34,090
you know,
when I was a kid and,

1769
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:36,360
and would smoke weed,
I would have panic attacks.

1770
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:40,140
And I think it's about the desire for
control of the ego.

1771
01:25:40,141 --> 01:25:42,380
The thinking mind moves is,
and it's,

1772
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,700
it's like a vampire confronted with
garlic,

1773
01:25:44,701 --> 01:25:48,300
you know,
it's just my ego's spoiling and can't

1774
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,150
handle the lack of control.
And it's not just the entity energy

1775
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:54,330
of those experiences that's so intense
where you just have no control over it,

1776
01:25:54,331 --> 01:25:56,970
but it's also,
it just blows apart your worldview.

1777
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:59,070
Like you had this idea that you think,
oh,

1778
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,630
you think you know what's really going
on,

1779
01:26:00,631 --> 01:26:02,670
and then you have one of those
experiences and it just shows you that

1780
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:04,140
you don't anything well

1781
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:06,350
and you are there,
you think you are,

1782
01:26:06,351 --> 01:26:09,710
you that there's some solid you there
and that that is called into question

1783
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:10,320
fundamentally.

1784
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,830
Yeah,
but it's humbling to be shown that all

1785
01:26:13,831 --> 01:26:15,450
your,
your ideas about how you think things

1786
01:26:15,451 --> 01:26:20,100
are just that you know,
that it's just like that you don't know.

1787
01:26:20,101 --> 01:26:22,260
Fuck all.
And that has been,

1788
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,270
that's my experience from doing,
doing that stuff.

1789
01:26:24,271 --> 01:26:27,390
It's like I just shows me that I'm just,
you know what?

1790
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:32,420
Just sit back to sit back and,
and let nature do what nature's going to

1791
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:33,490
do.

1792
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:35,710
Can you say sit back dude,
when there's no dude there,

1793
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:39,400
when that's what you're starting to see
and you get exploded.

1794
01:26:39,401 --> 01:26:42,400
So it basically you're going to.
It's a win win situation.

1795
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,940
Either you win because you're able to
stay super aquinas with a greater and

1796
01:26:45,941 --> 01:26:48,940
greater intensity of what you're
experiencing under a trip or you win

1797
01:26:48,941 --> 01:26:52,540
because you don't stay economists.
You fight with it and you get ripped to

1798
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:57,541
shreds and in that humbling moment you
that isn't itself is deeply consoling

1799
01:26:58,841 --> 01:27:01,900
and healing both.
I think it's like both sides of that are

1800
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:04,270
are positive.
It's like a net positive gain on both

1801
01:27:04,271 --> 01:27:06,800
sides of that.
That's how I legitimated you know,

1802
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:08,100
when I'm getting ripped apart.
Yeah.

1803
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,760
Getting ripped apart.
Yeah,

1804
01:27:11,761 --> 01:27:14,010
it does.
See you see what I'm worried about.

1805
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:15,480
Yeah,
that's what I'm worried about.

1806
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:18,150
Yeah.
I think it was just relax.

1807
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:18,770
It'll be fun.

1808
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,401
Yeah,
I know,

1809
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:21,020
but that's one of those things like get
it onto your.

1810
01:27:21,021 --> 01:27:25,580
When people say relaxed or get out of
your own way for somebody as tightly

1811
01:27:25,581 --> 01:27:28,310
wound as me,
it's a frustrating thing to hear because

1812
01:27:28,311 --> 01:27:29,130
it's hard for me to have

1813
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:33,300
racial gotta resist that clench.
Resist the clench.

1814
01:27:33,301 --> 01:27:37,830
Just let it go.
Sometimes you do get ripped apart.

1815
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:38,551
Yeah.
Oh you.

1816
01:27:38,551 --> 01:27:42,030
Most of the time if you do it right,
heroes dose.

1817
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,470
So that's part of the thing about it
though,

1818
01:27:44,471 --> 01:27:47,160
is you're supposed to thing heroes does.
Terence Mckenna?

1819
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,211
Yeah.
Yeah.

1820
01:27:48,211 --> 01:27:53,211
I got five dried grams.
That was seven to seven if you're

1821
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:57,480
interested,
but five dried grams is the recommended

1822
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:58,620
threshold.
Yeah.

1823
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,360
That's a different kind of emotional
experience.

1824
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:01,223
Yeah.

1825
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:02,133
Yeah.

1826
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,790
Um,
I think it's one of those things where

1827
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:10,330
if you test yourself slowly but surely
in those waters,

1828
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:15,050
you'll get more and more accustomed to
the feeling of relaxation and letting go

1829
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,200
and that treat it like it's a shamonic
experience.

1830
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:23,201
Like it's a very deep intensive search
to the very meaning of your existence

1831
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:27,350
and don't,
don't think of it as like,

1832
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:29,570
oh my God,
I'm about to do drugs.

1833
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,140
Right.
But

1834
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,360
there's.
They're not dissimilar in the way that

1835
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:39,370
when you don't know up from down when
you have no sensation of your body

1836
01:28:39,371 --> 01:28:43,510
anymore.
That is exposing the fundamental,

1837
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:49,240
the fundamental fact that Jeff has.
Jeff has used as this description over

1838
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,520
and over I think quite beautifully
throughout this discussion,

1839
01:28:51,521 --> 01:28:54,190
which is that we aren't as solid as we
think.

1840
01:28:54,191 --> 01:28:55,024
We are.
In fact,

1841
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:59,590
a process and the dude,
you're trying to console the dude.

1842
01:28:59,591 --> 01:29:04,320
It's okay that dude or do that.
There's no there,

1843
01:29:04,321 --> 01:29:08,700
there and that I could see myself going
in that direction in the tank that's

1844
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:12,000
inexorably where it takes you and that
is where psychedelics take you.

1845
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:13,800
And again,
I'm in,

1846
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:15,570
I have,
I'm in this weird position because I'm

1847
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:20,270
deeply interested in that experience and
I've tasted in my own meditation for

1848
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:22,620
sure.
So scared.

1849
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:24,150
Yeah,
I mean this is where meditation goes.

1850
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:28,260
If we're seeing that your,
that the you,

1851
01:29:28,261 --> 01:29:33,261
that you've been defending and
protecting since sentience actually

1852
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,320
doesn't exist is I think ultimately very
liberating really is the true

1853
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:43,890
liberation.
But seeing it initially as a,

1854
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:45,230
as a,
um,

1855
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,620
as a newbie is it tears apart as Jeff
says,

1856
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:51,010
your worldview,
the world,

1857
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:54,240
our worldview is based on us at the
center.

1858
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:56,130
It's a death experience.
Yes,

1859
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:56,700
exactly.

1860
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,820
So it seems to me it's like you want to
learn how to swim,

1861
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:03,870
but you really only interested in calf
high water because if you,

1862
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:07,560
if you really want to learn how to swim,
what happens is they take you out on a

1863
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:10,800
jet ski to the middle of the ocean.
They go jump off,

1864
01:30:10,801 --> 01:30:11,830
dude,
you're,

1865
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:13,890
you're,
you're now in the center of the ocean

1866
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:17,730
and that's the psychedelic trip.
The psychedelic trip is you are fucking

1867
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:19,010
swimming,
right?

1868
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,580
There's no if,
ands,

1869
01:30:20,581 --> 01:30:22,650
or buts.
You must keep going or you're going to

1870
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:23,470
drown.

1871
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:27,760
I think there are different approaches
based on different people because I

1872
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:29,830
think you're exactly right that I want
to swim,

1873
01:30:29,831 --> 01:30:32,560
but my tendency is to stick to the CAF
high water,

1874
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:37,540
but you're from what I know about you
having spent a little bit of time with

1875
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:40,540
you and just follow following you,
you're kind of a baller,

1876
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:44,740
like you're ready to go out on the jet
ski and jump in or do all this crazy

1877
01:30:44,741 --> 01:30:46,330
stuff that traditionally.
I mean,

1878
01:30:46,331 --> 01:30:48,400
I have done some crazy things that we
discussed,

1879
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:51,700
but traditionally I'm more cautious and
I think for somebody with my kind of

1880
01:30:51,701 --> 01:30:54,240
brain chemistry,
somebody whose brain is very good at

1881
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:56,230
panicking,
I think there's a more step wise

1882
01:30:56,231 --> 01:30:58,270
approach,
which is what I'm intrigued by,

1883
01:30:58,271 --> 01:30:59,830
which is what we're,
we keep discussing,

1884
01:30:59,831 --> 01:31:02,830
which is test those limits time and
again,

1885
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,270
keep testing them.
Don't,

1886
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:05,410
don't let up.

1887
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:06,490
For example,
for example,

1888
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,620
uh,
my shrink,

1889
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:13,060
the one who got me to stop doing drugs
after I had a panic attack on television

1890
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:15,500
and helped me,
you know,

1891
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:18,910
Kinda straighten myself out.
I had a panic attack or the beginnings

1892
01:31:18,911 --> 01:31:22,810
of a panic attack on a subway.
I'm about five years ago.

1893
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:24,160
And it was,
for me,

1894
01:31:24,161 --> 01:31:27,100
it was devastating because I was like,
this is such a setback.

1895
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,000
Um,
I'm right back at stage one.

1896
01:31:29,001 --> 01:31:30,730
I'm and my world is gonna get smaller
again.

1897
01:31:30,731 --> 01:31:34,690
So I went to go see him kind of on an
emergent basis and he laid out a plan,

1898
01:31:34,691 --> 01:31:38,920
which is not his original idea.
This is actually the way you treat these

1899
01:31:38,921 --> 01:31:41,230
things called exposure therapy where he
said,

1900
01:31:41,231 --> 01:31:42,910
okay,
here for the next 10 days I want you to

1901
01:31:42,911 --> 01:31:47,170
go stand on the subway platform every
day just for a couple of minutes.

1902
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:52,210
And then for the 10 days after that,
I want you to get on a subway or a car

1903
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:55,420
and then get off before the door closes,
five,

1904
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:58,360
five to 10 days.
And then after that I want you to get on

1905
01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:01,690
and go one.
And basically he got me back on the

1906
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:05,110
subway because I was able to gradually
get through.

1907
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:09,340
I'm not Joe Rogan from my.
I would never be able to host a show

1908
01:32:09,341 --> 01:32:11,760
called fear factor the way you did with
that,

1909
01:32:11,761 --> 01:32:14,470
unless it was a completely different
show where you know,

1910
01:32:14,471 --> 01:32:17,260
you're not getting in a tank full of
torrential is on the first day,

1911
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,750
you know,
I have to do in a step wise progression

1912
01:32:19,751 --> 01:32:21,280
because that's the way my brain is
wired.

1913
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:22,450
Absolutely.

1914
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:25,990
To me that there's going to be different
ways for folks to do it.

1915
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:31,050
They're definitely as did you,
were you exposed to a lot of difficulty

1916
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:34,570
when you were young?
Did you have to overcome physical

1917
01:32:34,571 --> 01:32:37,570
adversity?
Did you participate in any one on one

1918
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:38,000
sport

1919
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,730
or anything like that?
I think the problem was just the

1920
01:32:39,731 --> 01:32:43,420
opposite,
that I had two incredibly loving former

1921
01:32:43,421 --> 01:32:48,421
hippie parents.
I was a bit of a spoiled kid and Jeff

1922
01:32:48,431 --> 01:32:49,500
and I have talked about this,
that,

1923
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,720
uh,
to the extent that I experienced anger

1924
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,650
or frustration.
Oh,

1925
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,130
sorry.
It's because I'm not getting what I

1926
01:32:57,131 --> 01:32:59,170
want.
Yeah.

1927
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:02,560
But I did do some competitive sports.
I just wasn't very good at it.

1928
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:06,060
So do you guys have you guys heard of
somatic experiencing?

1929
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:11,700
So sematic experiencing.
It's the super interesting a way of

1930
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:15,690
addressing trauma that is starting to
get really influential in the body work

1931
01:33:15,691 --> 01:33:19,740
community and psychotherapists and
psychiatrists and psychologists are

1932
01:33:19,741 --> 01:33:22,440
starting to look at it and there's a
bunch of good papers out about it,

1933
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:26,850
but basically the thesis,
it comes from being really a guy named

1934
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:29,580
Peter Levine who spent a lot of time
looking at animal behavior.

1935
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:34,260
And what he noticed is that when animal
goes into a fight or flight situation,

1936
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,850
um,
they.

1937
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:39,600
So you're a gazelle and all of a sudden
there's the tiger and then you go,

1938
01:33:39,601 --> 01:33:42,750
you just exploded to action.
So there's this explosive release of

1939
01:33:42,751 --> 01:33:46,500
energy running or fighting,
whatever it is afterwards,

1940
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,560
they'll often go into this shaking
effect where they'll start trembling.

1941
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:52,170
I'm unconsciously or they can't control
it.

1942
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:54,540
It's like,
and what they think is that it's like

1943
01:33:54,541 --> 01:33:57,810
discharging all the excess energy and
then they go back to homeostasis.

1944
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:02,160
And so his theory is that what happens
with human beings is because we have

1945
01:34:02,161 --> 01:34:05,460
these giant frontal lobes that we get
shocks to our nervous system,

1946
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,700
um,
and we can't discharge the energy.

1947
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:12,660
We can't fucking punch your boss in the
face or we can't run or whatever.

1948
01:34:12,661 --> 01:34:14,790
And just the same as when we were kids,
we just swallow it up.

1949
01:34:14,791 --> 01:34:17,310
We swallowed up and the,
and that trapped energy,

1950
01:34:17,311 --> 01:34:20,520
the nervous system starts to become our
neurotic habits.

1951
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:24,630
It becomes chronic anxiety,
becomes a panic attacks.

1952
01:34:24,631 --> 01:34:27,750
It becomes chronic aggression or
irritability.

1953
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:30,150
Also,
chronic freeze responses get stuck in

1954
01:34:30,151 --> 01:34:31,650
there too,
which is sort of like chronic,

1955
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,260
not their illness or someone who sort a
little bit dreamy.

1956
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:37,470
And so somatic experiencing is a whole
way of working with it.

1957
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:39,990
We're basically,
it's sort of like exposure therapy,

1958
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,071
but it wouldn't,
it's not,

1959
01:34:41,071 --> 01:34:42,920
it's not the same.
It's like it's all in the,

1960
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:44,880
uh,
it's very meditative.

1961
01:34:44,881 --> 01:34:46,710
It's like you're working with somebody
and they,

1962
01:34:46,711 --> 01:34:48,240
and they go,
okay,

1963
01:34:48,241 --> 01:34:50,670
why are you coming to the awardee feel
comfortable sitting?

1964
01:34:50,671 --> 01:34:51,091
It's like,
oh,

1965
01:34:51,091 --> 01:34:52,650
I,
I feel a couple of sitting over here.

1966
01:34:52,651 --> 01:34:54,660
Why did you sit there?
Well,

1967
01:34:54,661 --> 01:34:56,340
I kinda like had my back to the wall.
Well,

1968
01:34:56,341 --> 01:34:58,370
what is it about having your back to the
wall that makes you feel more

1969
01:34:58,371 --> 01:35:00,680
comfortable?
I just feel this and it's like,

1970
01:35:00,681 --> 01:35:02,600
well then what's the opposite?
What's the discomfortable thing?

1971
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:03,810
And then you and you notice,
well,

1972
01:35:03,811 --> 01:35:06,230
what it would feel like to be
uncomfortable there and you basically

1973
01:35:06,231 --> 01:35:11,030
find a spot in your experience and your
consciousness which is very centered and

1974
01:35:11,031 --> 01:35:14,780
comfortable and then you find that the
problem and you try to simultaneously

1975
01:35:14,781 --> 01:35:18,830
notice both at the same time and
basically all the trapped energy of the

1976
01:35:18,831 --> 01:35:21,500
neurotic place starts to drain out that
making sense.

1977
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,570
I'm trying to make it visually vivid or
visual,

1978
01:35:23,571 --> 01:35:27,950
but that's how you work with this stuff.
So you can start to drain out these

1979
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:30,530
patterns of like chronic fear.
These paddocks of,

1980
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:32,450
of chronic fight.
You do it,

1981
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:35,180
uh,
by noticing how that pattern is in your

1982
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:38,120
body connecting to it.
And then it can kinda empty out.

1983
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,910
It's so interesting because it also
just,

1984
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,610
it,
it blows the lid off trauma.

1985
01:35:43,611 --> 01:35:46,330
It says trauma is going to be different
for every person.

1986
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,350
All traumas is just shock to the nervous
system.

1987
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:52,340
It's not just about surviving a
terrorist attack or you know,

1988
01:35:52,341 --> 01:35:55,280
all this horrible stuff.
It's like someone might do something to

1989
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:57,920
Dan in the,
in the smallest way when he's a two year

1990
01:35:57,921 --> 01:35:59,840
old,
that wasn't any big deal,

1991
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:03,710
but it completely freaked him out.
It basically shocked his nervous system

1992
01:36:03,711 --> 01:36:07,560
so intensely that now there's that
pattern of shock that's in there that

1993
01:36:07,561 --> 01:36:08,480
still lives in there.

1994
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,390
And what happens?
It just grows and grows and grows and

1995
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,770
because if you don't release that
energy,

1996
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:15,680
it just just keeps causing havoc in the
system.

1997
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:18,170
That's the thinking of somatic
experiencing.

1998
01:36:18,171 --> 01:36:19,940
It's.
And I've been working with somebody and

1999
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,350
I had a.
I mean,

2000
01:36:21,351 --> 01:36:22,700
just to give him,
to make it real.

2001
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,160
I had a,
I've had a lot of injuries in my life,

2002
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:28,700
like broken neck and broke,
busted shoulder and different things

2003
01:36:28,701 --> 01:36:31,940
from just being a jackass.
But one time I got hit by this truck,

2004
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:34,520
I was on my bike and it blew up my
shoulder,

2005
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,100
hit the ground.
And then uh,

2006
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,153
the,
uh,

2007
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:40,340
back of the truck hit me and he has sent
me spinning.

2008
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,770
Um,
and so one time I was in there working

2009
01:36:42,771 --> 01:36:45,330
with the somatic experiencing lady and
she's like,

2010
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,540
what direction do you want to look in?
I'm like,

2011
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:48,401
ah,
I kind of felt like,

2012
01:36:48,401 --> 01:36:50,810
look in this way if you don't,
you don't feel like looking that way.

2013
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:51,810
And I'm like,
no,

2014
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,840
it doesn't really.
I don't really want to turn my head this

2015
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:55,210
way.
I don't really want it.

2016
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:57,680
And I realized that that's always there.
I kinda don't want to look this way.

2017
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:58,761
And she's like,
well,

2018
01:36:58,761 --> 01:37:00,170
what,
what happens when you look this way?

2019
01:37:00,171 --> 01:37:01,010
And I,
it was like,

2020
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,610
I started looking this way and was
harder do and suddenly I remembered the

2021
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:10,050
impact of this truck from when I was 17
years old on this side of my body and I

2022
01:37:10,281 --> 01:37:15,281
could feel that the impact was still in
my body and she got me to work to turn

2023
01:37:16,401 --> 01:37:18,350
my head.
And like she got me to connect to that,

2024
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:20,360
to that.
So I'm thinking of that memory and I'm

2025
01:37:20,361 --> 01:37:24,710
feeling that memory in my body and she
gets me to work through that turning my

2026
01:37:24,711 --> 01:37:28,550
head and the act of doing that was like
all of a sudden

2027
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:33,170
I felt all this new freedom in this
pattern and I have now not had that

2028
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,840
issue as much.
And that's just to give you an example

2029
01:37:35,841 --> 01:37:38,200
of how you would work in that mode.
Isn't that.

2030
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:39,320
Isn't that cool?
I mean,

2031
01:37:39,321 --> 01:37:41,630
I find that to unbelievably.
I do too.

2032
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:45,170
That is interesting.
Listening to your story about your life,

2033
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:49,850
about the lack of difficulty.
It sort of reinforces my ideas about

2034
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:55,120
martial arts and that it's not about
learning how to be a great fighter

2035
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:00,450
learning on the beat people up.
It's learning how to battle your own

2036
01:38:00,451 --> 01:38:05,451
internal demons and,
and confront insecurities and fears and

2037
01:38:05,641 --> 01:38:10,641
to do it on a regular basis frees up a
lot of the mental landscape.

2038
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:16,500
It allows you to just be more relaxed
about a lot of different approaches to

2039
01:38:16,501 --> 01:38:20,740
life and this,
this tension and control that we have is

2040
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:25,770
a lot of time just pointless.
And it's highlighted by martial arts

2041
01:38:25,771 --> 01:38:26,520
training.
Yeah,

2042
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,540
I think it's almost always pointless.
Yeah.

2043
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:31,590
Although you know,
the thing is you look at a good fighter,

2044
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:34,740
just like if you look at a good dancer,
there's definitely a sense in which

2045
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:37,020
they're just flowing and they're
responding,

2046
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:39,450
but then when they need to be tensed,
boom,

2047
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,700
they got it.
It's like they got that power behind

2048
01:38:41,701 --> 01:38:43,290
them.
It's like if you were dancing,

2049
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:43,861
for example,
any.

2050
01:38:43,861 --> 01:38:46,290
All you did was just flatty flow.

2051
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:49,050
You would have,
there'd be no form to it.

2052
01:38:49,051 --> 01:38:51,300
It's like you need the pulling in,
you need that.

2053
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,640
So it's about the.
It's about the intelligent use of

2054
01:38:53,641 --> 01:38:54,480
tension,
you know,

2055
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:58,830
knowing when to be soft and then when to
be having those two sides.

2056
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:01,320
Yeah,
but what I'm talking about,

2057
01:39:01,321 --> 01:39:05,130
those,
the management of stressful physically

2058
01:39:05,131 --> 01:39:08,250
difficult things on a regular basis
frees the mind.

2059
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:09,500
Now just the,
the,

2060
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:12,900
the,
the getting comfortable with conflict

2061
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:17,190
and when in the absence of conflict,
then you look to try to restrict and

2062
01:39:17,191 --> 01:39:20,490
control everything and then every little
affront to that,

2063
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:25,170
any little questioning and challenging
of your control over things can cause

2064
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:28,710
anxiety because you're uncomfortable
with this idea of surrender,

2065
01:39:28,711 --> 01:39:30,420
of relax hoagland.
Totally.

2066
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:34,410
Whether it's in psychedelics or whether
it's meditation or all these things.

2067
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:36,030
There's some relationships.
Yeah,

2068
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,670
and stand up comedy,
communicating,

2069
01:39:38,671 --> 01:39:40,560
podcast hosting.
Good Morning America.

2070
01:39:40,561 --> 01:39:45,560
I mean there's so many parallels because
a lot of it is in managing the mind and

2071
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:48,120
just being able to,
again,

2072
01:39:48,121 --> 01:39:50,520
get out of your own way.
I agree.

2073
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:51,350
Yeah.

2074
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:52,700
Oh,
we got that shit sorted out

2075
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:58,020
tomorrow.
It'll pop up again in your cost while

2076
01:39:58,030 --> 01:39:59,080
you got to keep doing it.
It's like,

2077
01:39:59,081 --> 01:39:59,914
Hey,
these uses,

2078
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:02,530
these books are all saying the same
thing again and again and again,

2079
01:40:02,531 --> 01:40:04,180
but you still need to read it because
you forget.

2080
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:05,171
Yeah.
Yeah.

2081
01:40:05,171 --> 01:40:06,940
And it gets a little bit easier all the
time.

2082
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,140
You know,
managing the mind gets a little easier

2083
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:11,330
in part of it.
You could chalk up to maturity and life

2084
01:40:11,331 --> 01:40:13,460
experience,
but it's also just this continual

2085
01:40:13,461 --> 01:40:16,970
practice of paying attention to what's
going on inside your head.

2086
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:19,920
Exactly right.
Jeff doesn't like my analogy that I'm

2087
01:40:19,921 --> 01:40:22,530
about to use because he thinks it's
slightly aggressive and he's right,

2088
01:40:22,531 --> 01:40:25,200
but it's,
it's mostly meant for comic effect,

2089
01:40:25,201 --> 01:40:28,290
but it's like when you have a dog who
takes a shit on the rug,

2090
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:30,060
you kinda.
Sometimes you've got to put their snout

2091
01:40:30,061 --> 01:40:34,140
and shit and that is what we're doing in
meditation and in all of these

2092
01:40:34,141 --> 01:40:38,280
practices.
Seeing over and over again how crazy we

2093
01:40:38,281 --> 01:40:40,050
are,
how the fear arises,

2094
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:43,170
how the anger arises,
how the discontent with whatever's

2095
01:40:43,171 --> 01:40:47,490
happening right now arises and not
getting owned by it.

2096
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:50,160
And,
and that's why these practices so useful

2097
01:40:50,161 --> 01:40:52,500
and why you got to stick with them.
You don't get just fixed,

2098
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:53,590
you know,
it doesn't work.

2099
01:40:53,591 --> 01:40:54,340
That was nothing

2100
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,173
like that.
No.

2101
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:56,590
I mean,
there are a lot of people

2102
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:57,550
blood.
They're selling them.

2103
01:40:58,490 --> 01:41:00,410
Yeah.
Something real.

2104
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:05,110
What's the most annoying aspect of that
to you guys?

2105
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,270
Please go to the power of positive
thinking.

2106
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:09,290
Oh,
well,

2107
01:41:09,290 --> 01:41:10,880
you know,
we were talking about that yesterday

2108
01:41:10,881 --> 01:41:14,870
where people were talking about
President Oprah and I reminded everyone

2109
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:17,150
about Oprah and the secret.
I'm like,

2110
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,030
do you know how many fucking people ruin
their lives because they thought all

2111
01:41:20,031 --> 01:41:23,390
they had to do was have a vision board
and think positive and this is going to

2112
01:41:23,391 --> 01:41:25,120
be the key to happiness.
Yeah.

2113
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:29,100
I think it's.
It's one of the most pernicious ideas

2114
01:41:29,101 --> 01:41:34,020
that's ever been sort of released into
our culture and it even predates the

2115
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:36,270
secret because there's.
There's a book called the power of

2116
01:41:36,271 --> 01:41:38,100
positive thinking.
There's another book called think and

2117
01:41:38,101 --> 01:41:41,310
grow rich.
I don't want people to go buy these

2118
01:41:41,311 --> 01:41:46,090
books because I don't think.
See that the idea that you can solve all

2119
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:51,110
your problems through the power of
positive thinking is so easily

2120
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:54,210
disproved.
Just engaged in the following thought

2121
01:41:54,211 --> 01:41:59,160
experiment.
Anybody who's born right now in a

2122
01:41:59,161 --> 01:42:02,520
refugee camp,
were they thinking incorrectly in Utero

2123
01:42:02,910 --> 01:42:07,020
in 2010 when the.
When the earthquake hit Puerto Prince,

2124
01:42:07,021 --> 01:42:09,180
Haiti,
it was everybody in town thinking

2125
01:42:09,181 --> 01:42:11,100
incorrectly.
Did they bring that upon themselves?

2126
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:12,900
Of course not.
Of course not,

2127
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:17,220
and yet we're telling all these people
that if you make a good vision board,

2128
01:42:17,221 --> 01:42:19,800
you can carry your cancer or you don't
have to go to the doctor.

2129
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:24,000
All this.
It is demonstrably false and recklessly

2130
01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:24,863
dangerous

2131
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:28,920
and most of the people that have had
success with the power of positive

2132
01:42:28,921 --> 01:42:32,040
thinking,
they attributed to that,

2133
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:35,760
but you're not talking to any of the
people that thought the exact same way

2134
01:42:35,761 --> 01:42:37,860
and failed.
You're only talking to the successful

2135
01:42:37,861 --> 01:42:40,590
people.
The the sampling is so biased.

2136
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:43,360
The only people who've had all their
problems solved through the power of

2137
01:42:43,361 --> 01:42:47,650
positive thinking or the people writing
those fucking books and selling all the

2138
01:42:47,651 --> 01:42:49,840
copies and if by the way,
if it was that easy,

2139
01:42:49,841 --> 01:42:51,190
they're all new.
One book.

2140
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:51,971
Yeah,
well,

2141
01:42:51,971 --> 01:42:53,500
I would say writing books.
I keep saying,

2142
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:56,590
come back to this next seminar in this
freezing cold room with your credit

2143
01:42:56,591 --> 01:42:59,110
card,
but I will say the one part of it that

2144
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:02,680
they idea that you can have an intention
that having a clear intention of

2145
01:43:02,681 --> 01:43:05,680
something about how you want to be or
something that you want to have happen,

2146
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:08,290
that that can be helpful.
I think that's common sense,

2147
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:11,750
the difference between having a positive
attitude.

2148
01:43:11,970 --> 01:43:14,320
Yeah,
absolutely beneficial.

2149
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:15,340
Yes.
Absolutely.

2150
01:43:15,341 --> 01:43:16,580
Do you guys have you heard,
um,

2151
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:17,800
you know,
William James,

2152
01:43:17,801 --> 01:43:20,830
the great kind of psych psychologist,
a mystic,

2153
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:23,530
he was a mystic.
He had this really cool,

2154
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:24,610
um,
he talked about,

2155
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:27,100
uh,
I think it was called first born versus

2156
01:43:27,101 --> 01:43:29,530
twice born or one sport once born and
twice born.

2157
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:32,620
And it was a fundamental way in which
you distinguished people who had,

2158
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,140
who have maybe had a spiritual outlook
in life.

2159
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:38,290
And he said the ones born people were.
People were just naturally,

2160
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,060
they're the kind of the positive
thinkers.

2161
01:43:40,061 --> 01:43:43,660
The kind of like everything is perfect.
Everything is awesome.

2162
01:43:43,661 --> 01:43:48,661
This rose colored view of reality and
really not able to kind of see suffering

2163
01:43:49,121 --> 01:43:50,650
and everything,
that kind of a thing,

2164
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,660
and we all Kinda know people like that.
It kind of the classic,

2165
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:56,180
a naive spiritual person,
uh,

2166
01:43:56,660 --> 01:44:00,740
but he was really interested in the,
what he called twice born and that's

2167
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:02,030
what he was.
And I feel like that's,

2168
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:05,600
that's certainly how I identify which is
somebody who can come into a kind of

2169
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:08,480
perspective,
like a mystical or spiritual perspective

2170
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:13,780
but has to but only did it via having to
look hard at the reality of suffering at

2171
01:44:14,121 --> 01:44:16,950
the reality of evil,
of fucked up shit in the world like

2172
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,790
that.
You can't wave away the world's unfair

2173
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:24,791
distribution of wealth and hardship and
that you had to come to that.

2174
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:30,040
You had to come to your view through a
honest reckoning with the crappy stuff

2175
01:44:30,891 --> 01:44:33,740
about being a human being and the crappy
stuff that's out there and that you

2176
01:44:33,741 --> 01:44:36,200
couldn't not look at it and that you
could do that.

2177
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:40,430
Like tolstoy was the famous example.
Then you kind of could be reborn into a,

2178
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:45,350
a perspective that was wide enough to
include the full bittersweet and that.

2179
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:47,090
And so I think that's what I think to
the,

2180
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,410
to the,
to the twice born,

2181
01:44:48,411 --> 01:44:53,000
the first born outlook is kind of
repellent because it seems like it's not

2182
01:44:53,001 --> 01:44:56,930
looking at the truth of all the very
real challenges that are going out

2183
01:44:56,931 --> 01:44:58,010
there.
It's like you could just be in,

2184
01:44:58,011 --> 01:44:59,600
you'd go to your yoga class and heat
your,

2185
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:02,570
your perfect raw food and be in your
perfect bubble.

2186
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,930
But,
but meanwhile the world is just

2187
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:08,960
contracted in pain.
And to really be a kind of true,

2188
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:13,910
expansive humanist is to kind of look at
all that and to still find your way into

2189
01:45:13,911 --> 01:45:15,530
thinking that life is worth living.
You know,

2190
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:17,720
there's a mystery there.
And um,

2191
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:18,553
um,

2192
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:19,620
yeah,
I'm trying.

2193
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:23,220
I guess you have to recognize that there
are these horrible things in the world,

2194
01:45:23,221 --> 01:45:28,221
but concentrating on them fully in an
only is not going to benefit you in

2195
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:30,330
form.
That's also true.

2196
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:35,570
It's like there are amazing things to
this life and the more you concentrate

2197
01:45:35,701 --> 01:45:38,730
on them,
the more you'll recognize them,

2198
01:45:38,731 --> 01:45:43,200
the more you'll sort of baskin right?
The amazing experience that we're all

2199
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:46,470
going through this right now,
and so what you're describing as

2200
01:45:46,471 --> 01:45:49,530
elements of positive thinking,
that's the good side.

2201
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:52,470
That's totally legit.
That positivity,

2202
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:55,320
positive attitude as opposed to positive
thinking,

2203
01:45:55,321 --> 01:45:58,830
which is loaded up with this idea of
like sort of mental control of the

2204
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:01,700
external world and that I think is
dangerous,

2205
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:03,780
but I think Joe's describing is
gratitude.

2206
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,450
Yes,
absolutely.

2207
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:06,341
Absolutely.
That's,

2208
01:46:06,341 --> 01:46:08,580
that's so important.
But it's important to parse this out.

2209
01:46:08,610 --> 01:46:11,850
What part of this is healthy and good
and what part of this is destructive?

2210
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:13,060
Yes,
I agree.

2211
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:15,300
Right,
and what part of it you could parse out

2212
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:18,060
from what you would call the law of
attraction,

2213
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:20,120
which is not a law,
so I was not.

2214
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:22,020
I mean that's another part of the
problem too.

2215
01:46:22,021 --> 01:46:25,950
Like the Wu is written in the title like
it's not a law,

2216
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:29,940
it's just that's not what it is.
So you calling it the law of attraction,

2217
01:46:29,941 --> 01:46:32,580
let's be know you're full of shit that
was law made by Zeus.

2218
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:38,370
See that episode of Hercules.
There's something that's undeniably

2219
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:43,400
important about positive thinking,
having a positive attitude and being

2220
01:46:44,341 --> 01:46:49,341
enthusiastic and having energy and
focusing on the good and focusing your

2221
01:46:49,351 --> 01:46:51,750
goals and focus on what you're trying to
achieve,

2222
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:55,220
but the idea that that in and of itself
is all you need,

2223
01:46:55,221 --> 01:46:58,080
that that it's,
it's uniquely powerful and then it can

2224
01:46:58,081 --> 01:47:02,680
literally bring you your future and then
all these people that say that,

2225
01:47:02,681 --> 01:47:04,550
that this is what they used,
like you know,

2226
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:09,560
you might have been successful and that
might be your underlying thought

2227
01:47:09,931 --> 01:47:14,520
process,
but there is a wider series of factors.

2228
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:18,210
There's a big spectrum of things that
had to happen for you to be successful,

2229
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:21,630
including luck,
including the great fortune of being

2230
01:47:21,631 --> 01:47:23,700
born in America and privilege.
Yeah,

2231
01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:27,480
there's so many different places.
You could be so many different life

2232
01:47:27,481 --> 01:47:30,450
experiences.
You've could have had horrific parental

2233
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:33,420
situations in an household,
situations you could have been born

2234
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:35,550
into.
You're extremely lucky.

2235
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,750
Look at the case of James Arthur Ray.
I covered it extensively for ABC news

2236
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:42,360
that the,
he was one of the gurus in the secret,

2237
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:47,190
in the DVD of the secret.
He was one of the guys talking about how

2238
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:51,780
the universe is like Aladdin's lamp and
he held a sweat lodge ceremony in

2239
01:47:51,781 --> 01:47:52,710
Sedona,
Arizona,

2240
01:47:52,711 --> 01:47:54,300
which several people died and he went to
prison.

2241
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:56,910
So how well was the law of attraction
work for him?

2242
01:47:57,740 --> 01:47:58,820
Yeah,
maybe it did work.

2243
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:02,440
He put in a bunch of bullshit and got
some.

2244
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:04,790
Yeah.
They also found in his hotel room a lot

2245
01:48:04,791 --> 01:48:08,300
of like a hgh and testosterone and stuff
like that.

2246
01:48:08,301 --> 01:48:11,990
So he definitely wasn't as buff just
through the power of positive things

2247
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:17,220
and he was trying to do what would the
sweat lodge like,

2248
01:48:17,221 --> 01:48:18,100
what was the.
I like,

2249
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:20,760
look,
the sweat lodge is a beautiful ceremony

2250
01:48:20,761 --> 01:48:22,150
from,
for native Americans,

2251
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:26,850
people too hot or too hot and they
overheated and their electrolyte balance

2252
01:48:26,851 --> 01:48:30,630
got crazy or something and how to people
dying or something like that.

2253
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:32,970
You know,
it was awhile ago so I can't remember,

2254
01:48:32,971 --> 01:48:34,170
but I think it was two people.

2255
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:39,560
The problem with a lot of those people
too is that what they do is they,

2256
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:43,740
they put together like some sort of a
program where maybe it's a book,

2257
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:46,420
maybe it's a a guideline you're supposed
to follow.

2258
01:48:46,421 --> 01:48:49,830
Then they start teaching seminars in it
and they start putting it into practice

2259
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:53,520
and leading all these people with this
stuff and that it becomes who they are,

2260
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:58,410
like who they are is like a guru who
they are as a spiritual person and

2261
01:48:58,411 --> 01:49:01,860
people come to them that the dynamic
they have people come to them,

2262
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:06,090
what should I do?
And the universe provides bounty.

2263
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:08,310
Oh,
and everybody claps and goes along with

2264
01:49:08,311 --> 01:49:11,190
it and they live in this sort of bubble.
Yeah.

2265
01:49:11,191 --> 01:49:13,970
And it just,
it gets really odd with those folks.

2266
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:15,450
Yeah.
I mean that was why.

2267
01:49:15,451 --> 01:49:19,140
I mean I was,
I had been assigned a years and years

2268
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:23,070
ago to cover faith and spirituality for
ABC news even though I'm an agnostic and

2269
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:27,090
I ended up covering a lot of these new
age gurus and that was why I ended up.

2270
01:49:27,091 --> 01:49:30,060
My first book I wrote was called 10
percent happier because I was trying to

2271
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:34,250
counter program against the Sea of
bullshit that is America is

2272
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:38,250
$11,000,000,000 a year self help
industry because I was watching what

2273
01:49:38,251 --> 01:49:39,630
this was doing to people's lives.

2274
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:42,830
It's so far.
We've been talking about that a lot

2275
01:49:42,831 --> 01:49:45,440
lately.
There's so many people that are trying

2276
01:49:45,441 --> 01:49:49,600
to get in this on sort of the open level
when you see it on Instagram,

2277
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:53,350
like there's a lot of people like
promoting these inspirational little

2278
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:58,070
posts and they'll have these little
inspirational videos like you know,

2279
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:03,080
what you got to do today is go out there
and embrace life and just go after your

2280
01:50:03,701 --> 01:50:06,400
goals and like.
And there's so many people that are

2281
01:50:06,401 --> 01:50:11,401
trying to give people this fuel and give
people this and they might not

2282
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:17,080
necessarily really even be in practice
with that themselves.

2283
01:50:17,490 --> 01:50:18,700
Yeah,
it's A.

2284
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:21,540
I liked the open.
I like your analogy about the open mic.

2285
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:23,890
That is what it's like.
It's like they're trying it out.

2286
01:50:23,891 --> 01:50:25,960
They're learning how to be an Anthony
Robbins.

2287
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,390
Tony Robbins.
It's funny.

2288
01:50:27,391 --> 01:50:30,880
I have a friend who was living in France
and they came back to Canada and he'd

2289
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,780
been in Paris,
live in there for like 10 years or

2290
01:50:33,781 --> 01:50:37,890
something and so he's walking around the
streets of Toronto and he said it was

2291
01:50:37,891 --> 01:50:41,310
the same when he was anywhere in North
America and he kept feeling like there

2292
01:50:41,311 --> 01:50:43,220
was something wrong,
but he couldn't put his finger on it.

2293
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:44,250
It was like,
what is wrong?

2294
01:50:44,251 --> 01:50:46,500
Something wrong,
and then he realized that everyone was

2295
01:50:46,501 --> 01:50:49,920
actually having the same conversation
all the time over and over again,

2296
01:50:49,921 --> 01:50:51,120
which was everything's gonna be all
right.

2297
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:53,280
Adam is going to be all right.
Everyone's going to be all right.

2298
01:50:53,281 --> 01:50:56,340
It was just this constant pepe
cheerleading from everywhere.

2299
01:50:56,341 --> 01:51:00,110
Whereas in France it's just like,
things are fucked that is fucked.

2300
01:51:00,510 --> 01:51:01,580
No,
you are shit.

2301
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:03,910
And that's what it's like being in
France know.

2302
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:06,240
It's like at least they're honest,
but that has its downsides,

2303
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,940
downside,
but I mean there's also a realism where

2304
01:51:08,941 --> 01:51:10,860
people are just gonna,
like call it out as it is.

2305
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,120
We're here.
There's such A.

2306
01:51:12,121 --> 01:51:16,210
There's a tendency to just to Kinda.
There can be this kind of Pollyanna ish.

2307
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:18,270
Everything is fine.
Everything is fine because people don't

2308
01:51:18,271 --> 01:51:20,520
really want to look at what's under,
what's lurking underneath,

2309
01:51:20,521 --> 01:51:21,360
you know,
well,

2310
01:51:21,361 --> 01:51:24,570
everything's fine right now in this
moment,

2311
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:26,100
right?
Most of the time.

2312
01:51:26,101 --> 01:51:31,101
Now we've got pro most of the time in,
but can we talk about the mystical

2313
01:51:31,441 --> 01:51:36,330
mystery underbelly weirdness,
show off this idea that everything is

2314
01:51:36,331 --> 01:51:39,510
fine in the moment,
this exact moment right now,

2315
01:51:40,050 --> 01:51:43,320
like so in practice,
this is something Shin Zen taught me

2316
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:47,640
that the more you.
It's almost like the present moment is

2317
01:51:47,641 --> 01:51:49,830
on a continuum and that didn't sound
make any sense,

2318
01:51:49,831 --> 01:51:53,940
but it's like you can be present and you
need to be more present and more and

2319
01:51:53,941 --> 01:51:56,460
more and you can start to get a feeling
for that.

2320
01:51:56,700 --> 01:52:00,900
For practice of just the absolute.
Now it's like you're getting closer and

2321
01:52:00,901 --> 01:52:03,480
closer to the absolute now with ever
actually getting there,

2322
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:05,670
which I know just sounds like a bunch of
gobbly goop,

2323
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,650
but the feeling on the inside,
it's just this.

2324
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:10,380
Everything is.
It's like the silence,

2325
01:52:10,381 --> 01:52:12,810
this presence.
It's like this sacredness,

2326
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:15,120
you know,
the no bullshit kind of sacredness

2327
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:18,750
that.
What is that,

2328
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:21,310
you know,
that to me is like I wrote about

2329
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:24,420
consciousness for a long time before I
started realizing that there's this

2330
01:52:24,421 --> 01:52:27,510
thing here and how do you talk about,
how do you write about it in a way it

2331
01:52:27,511 --> 01:52:29,190
doesn't sound ridiculous,
you know,

2332
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:32,760
and yet it is the most important thing.
It is the most,

2333
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:36,360
uh,
it orients you to be able to come into

2334
01:52:36,361 --> 01:52:37,630
that understanding.
Yeah.

2335
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:38,850
How do we talk about it?
You know,

2336
01:52:38,851 --> 01:52:41,190
the mystics have always said you can't
talk about it.

2337
01:52:41,190 --> 01:52:43,740
It's inevitable,
but it's true as an experience.

2338
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:46,430
But where is it?
Bears talked about intelligently,

2339
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:49,430
where are you going to read about that
in the New Yorker magazine or,

2340
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,080
or whatever.
You know,

2341
01:52:51,081 --> 01:52:52,700
it's like,
it's either talked about in this

2342
01:52:52,701 --> 01:52:55,520
Disneyland way or it's not talked about
at all.

2343
01:52:55,550 --> 01:52:57,920
It's like we got to try to talk about,
we got to try to,

2344
01:52:57,921 --> 01:53:01,280
or at least remember not taco about come
to find practices,

2345
01:53:01,281 --> 01:53:04,790
you know,
but honor that it's real and you know

2346
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:08,330
that that's something I'm really
interested in and I'm trying to learn

2347
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:09,200
how to do it.
Now.

2348
01:53:09,201 --> 01:53:10,920
Let me ask you this.
As an outsider,

2349
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:14,660
if someone is coming to this with zero
meditation experience,

2350
01:53:14,661 --> 01:53:17,360
no,
no thought whatsoever about pursuing

2351
01:53:17,361 --> 01:53:19,550
this and they're listening to you say
these things like,

2352
01:53:19,551 --> 01:53:21,410
okay,
what's in it for me?

2353
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:23,450
What do I get out of that?
What do I get?

2354
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:25,250
If I can get to this,
what do I get?

2355
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:27,860
What's what's in there?
It seems like you're just alive.

2356
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:30,410
Yeah,
like this doesn't seem like anything

2357
01:53:30,411 --> 01:53:31,490
changes.
Well,

2358
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:33,380
I think that is what you get.
You get your life,

2359
01:53:33,410 --> 01:53:35,660
you get your life back.
Most of the time you're not in your

2360
01:53:35,661 --> 01:53:37,310
life.
You're freaking out about your life.

2361
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,380
You're in your head thinking about this,
this or that happened,

2362
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:43,610
or you're responding to situations.
What you get is the capacity to be

2363
01:53:43,611 --> 01:53:47,090
sitting here in the middle of all this
and be an appreciate the richness and

2364
01:53:47,091 --> 01:53:48,770
the fullness of it because that's the
thing.

2365
01:53:48,771 --> 01:53:51,230
It has,
it has a quality of a,

2366
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:54,410
of fulfillment in it,
has a quality of like nothing needs to

2367
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:58,130
be any different.
So there's a peacefulness and a beauty

2368
01:53:58,131 --> 01:53:59,930
or something or even when things are
objective,

2369
01:53:59,931 --> 01:54:03,290
even when things are shitty and his
bittersweetness so you know,

2370
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:06,770
this poignancy to things,
it's like you get exactly your life,

2371
01:54:06,771 --> 01:54:07,604
just more of it.

2372
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:08,630
And that's why,
you know,

2373
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:11,300
Shinzen used to say it's like,
it's like you lived,

2374
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:14,450
it's like it,
you get to live 10 times deeper or va

2375
01:54:14,451 --> 01:54:17,420
one time to two times deeper or three
times or four times the more you

2376
01:54:17,421 --> 01:54:18,254
practice,
it's like,

2377
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:22,010
it's the same surface,
but it's the depth dimension that's

2378
01:54:22,011 --> 01:54:25,340
getting like richer and fuller,
broader.

2379
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:26,640
Um,
and,

2380
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:29,930
and so then it gives you the capacity to
also to appreciate more and more what's

2381
01:54:29,931 --> 01:54:32,180
going on because most of the time we
walk around like,

2382
01:54:32,181 --> 01:54:33,500
ah,
this is the stuff I like looking at.

2383
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:36,400
But I don't like this stuff over here,
I don't want to feel these things are,

2384
01:54:36,401 --> 01:54:37,940
I don't want to see these things.
So we're like,

2385
01:54:38,210 --> 01:54:39,470
we're kind of,
you know,

2386
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:41,180
we're,
it's like we live.

2387
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:43,700
The analogy I use is like,
we're born into a mansion,

2388
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:45,290
but room by room we're like,
nope,

2389
01:54:45,291 --> 01:54:46,070
can't go in there.

2390
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:48,020
Can't go in there.
That's my ex girlfriend.

2391
01:54:48,021 --> 01:54:49,490
Or that's my relationship with my
parents.

2392
01:54:49,491 --> 01:54:51,080
Or Oh,
that's this limitation of this

2393
01:54:51,081 --> 01:54:52,910
limitation.
At some point we're just sitting there

2394
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:55,370
under the stairs.
Everything is fine.

2395
01:54:55,630 --> 01:54:56,451
I think it's fine.
Yeah.

2396
01:54:56,451 --> 01:54:58,700
I've really enjoyed my life.
Were hiding in the dark under the

2397
01:54:58,701 --> 01:54:59,534
stairs.
Go.

2398
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:01,940
So you want to.
It's about reclaiming the mansion,

2399
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:02,720
you know,
it's like,

2400
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,550
can you be,
like you said exactly,

2401
01:55:04,551 --> 01:55:07,850
can you be free in more and more
situations and can you begin to

2402
01:55:07,851 --> 01:55:09,860
appreciate the,
uh,

2403
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:13,760
the beauty of even these difficult
situations and that way your whole life

2404
01:55:13,761 --> 01:55:16,310
just kinda can open up to you.
That's what the practice is about.

2405
01:55:16,570 --> 01:55:20,320
Other way of thinking about it and is,
and this is a bit of a new age trope,

2406
01:55:20,321 --> 01:55:22,780
so it's a little annoying.
But it's like what I said before that

2407
01:55:23,290 --> 01:55:28,290
cliches become cliches for a reason and
the reason is their true generally all

2408
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:33,390
you get ever because right now,
everything you've experienced in your

2409
01:55:33,461 --> 01:55:37,750
whole life happened to you right now and
everything you ever will experience will

2410
01:55:37,751 --> 01:55:40,150
always happen to you right now.
Non Negotiable.

2411
01:55:40,570 --> 01:55:42,130
We live most of our lives.
However,

2412
01:55:42,131 --> 01:55:46,590
in a autopilot of in a fog of rumination
and projection,

2413
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:49,140
and we're not paying any attention to
the only thing we ever get.

2414
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:53,280
Meditation,
digging more deeply into the present

2415
01:55:53,281 --> 01:55:56,160
moment is giving you your life back

2416
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:59,200
now.
How do you address?

2417
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:04,320
Because what we're talking about is
managing the mind and increasing

2418
01:56:04,901 --> 01:56:07,360
happiness by 10 percent or more.
Hopefully.

2419
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:11,890
How do you address psych meds?
Because a lot of people that are going

2420
01:56:11,891 --> 01:56:16,030
down this road have already gone down
the pharmaceutical road and might be

2421
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:21,090
inextricably connected to it.
Some sort of a way they might be on anti

2422
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:24,010
anxiety medication,
be on antidepressants.

2423
01:56:24,011 --> 01:56:25,540
Like how do you address that?

2424
01:56:26,230 --> 01:56:28,180
Jay?
I think I can speak for both of us and

2425
01:56:28,181 --> 01:56:31,600
that we are maximalists that when it
comes to wellbeing,

2426
01:56:31,870 --> 01:56:33,340
it's important.
You got to surround the ball,

2427
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,230
you got to use every Arrow in the
quiver,

2428
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:39,280
and uh,
just because we're in the meditation

2429
01:56:39,281 --> 01:56:44,281
doesn't mean we're not into all the
other scientifically proven ways of

2430
01:56:46,061 --> 01:56:48,220
dealing with your mental health.
You know,

2431
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:50,890
I often say that we,
as a culture,

2432
01:56:50,891 --> 01:56:53,380
we spent so much time working on our
bodies,

2433
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:58,440
on our stock portfolio is on our cars
and no time on the one filter through

2434
01:56:58,511 --> 01:57:00,850
which we experience everything and
that's our minds.

2435
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:05,080
And so if you have clinically diagnosed
anxiety or depression,

2436
01:57:05,110 --> 01:57:07,930
which again,
we need to be talking about more openly

2437
01:57:07,931 --> 01:57:09,310
because there's so much stigma around
it.

2438
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,340
I've dealt with both since I was a kid.
If you have that,

2439
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:15,940
you should avail yourself of every
possible remedy and if your doctor

2440
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:20,320
recommends a that you take psych meds,
then you should investigate it.

2441
01:57:20,321 --> 01:57:22,600
If it works for you,
then stay on a meditation is just

2442
01:57:22,601 --> 01:57:26,680
another thing you can also use along
with exercise,

2443
01:57:26,681 --> 01:57:28,900
getting enough sleep,
having positive relationships,

2444
01:57:28,901 --> 01:57:32,350
having a healthy diet.
All the other no brainers with Jeff and

2445
01:57:32,351 --> 01:57:35,440
I are saying is in the Pantheon of no
brainers,

2446
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:37,360
meditation needs to be included.

2447
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:38,960
Yeah.
I think,

2448
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,210
I think with the meds thing,
um,

2449
01:57:42,010 --> 01:57:44,610
sometimes meds can get you to the
baseline of uh,

2450
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:46,710
then then you can meditate,
you know,

2451
01:57:46,711 --> 01:57:49,590
and it's almost like a,
I mean,

2452
01:57:49,591 --> 01:57:52,470
I know too many people whose lives have
been including people I know really,

2453
01:57:52,471 --> 01:57:55,080
really well really,
really helped by these meds.

2454
01:57:55,081 --> 01:57:57,090
I know other people have had super hard
time with it,

2455
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:59,970
but some of them at the same boat and
some of them it's like,

2456
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,380
it gets you to a place where it's almost
like the meds can help by time for your

2457
01:58:04,381 --> 01:58:08,220
own system to work itself out.
And so you get to a place where you're

2458
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:10,440
like,
I have a lot of trouble with crazy

2459
01:58:10,441 --> 01:58:12,330
energy surges up and down.
Like,

2460
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:14,310
and like a manic phase.
Yeah.

2461
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,620
Like I get,
I get hypomanic and then I get like

2462
01:58:16,621 --> 01:58:18,330
disparate and then hyper hypo manic.

2463
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:20,670
I actually just got a diagnosis,
uh,

2464
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:25,140
two weeks ago that I probably have a
mild form of bipolar is 46 years old.

2465
01:58:25,141 --> 01:58:26,610
I'm finally learning,
but it's not a surprise.

2466
01:58:26,611 --> 01:58:28,710
I kind of knew how do they,
how do they diagnose that?

2467
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:30,280
So,
uh,

2468
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:31,470
uh,
so it was an interview,

2469
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:34,080
so it's an hour long.
This case was like an hour and a half or

2470
01:58:34,081 --> 01:58:37,890
an hour long interview or a guy just
really took my history,

2471
01:58:37,891 --> 01:58:41,440
like how I've been challenged.
I have add big time add that's,

2472
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:45,310
that's been diagnosed multiple times but
just because the way my attention works,

2473
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:50,590
but he basically really asked me lots of
questions about how about my history and

2474
01:58:50,591 --> 01:58:55,230
when things started to get into the more
surges and,

2475
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,570
and they've been getting worse the past.
And this is entering [inaudible].

2476
01:58:57,571 --> 01:58:59,970
I meditated a ton but,
and,

2477
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:01,690
and there was a period of the meditation
was super,

2478
01:59:01,691 --> 01:59:03,910
super working really well and
stabilizing everything.

2479
01:59:04,120 --> 01:59:06,310
And then there was a period where the
meditation felt like it wasn't working

2480
01:59:06,311 --> 01:59:08,950
as well and all this energy,
it's like that trauma stuff I was

2481
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:10,810
talking about.
All that stuff started to come up.

2482
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:14,530
So I go more into these ups and downs
and I found that the practice would

2483
01:59:14,531 --> 01:59:16,180
help.
It would help me from feeding the

2484
01:59:16,181 --> 01:59:19,110
spikes,
but it wasn't I a,

2485
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:20,770
it hasn't been totally addressing it.
Now.

2486
01:59:20,771 --> 01:59:23,900
I haven't actually started any meds or
done any lithium metal.

2487
01:59:23,901 --> 01:59:27,400
I'm thinking maybe I would try that
because I want to understand what folks

2488
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:28,960
go through.
Um,

2489
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:31,690
but basically he just asks a lot of
questions.

2490
01:59:32,230 --> 01:59:32,980
There's,
you know,

2491
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:35,230
I guess he,
they have a diagnostic criteria around a

2492
01:59:35,231 --> 01:59:37,420
set of like,
does that seem to make sense for what we

2493
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:40,180
know about it and because they've seen
all these patients,

2494
01:59:40,181 --> 01:59:42,550
they've got all these ideas and it's so
new.

2495
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:44,020
I don't even know what to do with the
information.

2496
01:59:44,021 --> 01:59:45,520
In fact,
I'm kind of can't believe I'm talking

2497
01:59:45,530 --> 01:59:47,920
about it because it seems a bit
premature,

2498
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:49,430
but I'm,
you know,

2499
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:52,690
the way I think about it as I would
consider doing meds because I just want

2500
01:59:52,691 --> 01:59:57,370
to be able to get to a place where I
could then let my body heal itself,

2501
01:59:57,371 --> 01:59:59,050
help itself out,
figure itself out,

2502
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:01,060
and the meds might buy me time to do
that.

2503
02:00:01,061 --> 02:00:04,600
Then they and the meditation can be part
of that as well and that's just a messy

2504
02:00:04,601 --> 02:00:05,940
human reality of it.
But you,

2505
02:00:05,941 --> 02:00:07,810
you seem like you've got your shit
together.

2506
02:00:07,811 --> 02:00:11,290
So like what is it exactly that's
bothering you so much?

2507
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:13,120
You'd actually be considering
medication?

2508
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:15,400
Well,
it's try writing a book with them.

2509
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:16,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

2510
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:21,340
So I'm like fine.
Six days a week and then one day a week.

2511
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:23,350
So there's the,
there's the potential stuff.

2512
02:00:23,351 --> 02:00:26,800
Just being overexcited about things in
my getting pulled in every direction.

2513
02:00:26,801 --> 02:00:28,690
That's not really a problem so much
anymore.

2514
02:00:28,691 --> 02:00:31,810
Like I've learned to the problems.
There were more like you disappoint

2515
02:00:31,811 --> 02:00:33,370
people,
you feel like you can't get your shit

2516
02:00:33,371 --> 02:00:34,810
together,
you know,

2517
02:00:34,811 --> 02:00:38,770
you're just,
you're just so scattered that can happen

2518
02:00:38,771 --> 02:00:40,600
and,
and that back and upgrade its own

2519
02:00:40,601 --> 02:00:42,520
challenges,
but the energy ones are more

2520
02:00:42,521 --> 02:00:43,630
fundamental.
It's like,

2521
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:45,400
I'll wake up in the morning,
you know,

2522
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:48,970
it might be once every week or two and
all of a sudden I can feel my heart

2523
02:00:48,971 --> 02:00:53,080
pounding and I could feel like this
incredible energy in my hands and my

2524
02:00:53,081 --> 02:00:56,770
body and I just,
I'm in this hypo manic state and I,

2525
02:00:57,090 --> 02:00:58,150
and I,
and it feels good.

2526
02:00:58,151 --> 02:00:59,500
I don't even realize it,
but I'm going around,

2527
02:00:59,501 --> 02:01:01,230
I'm talking,
I'm excited about stuff and I'm just

2528
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:03,120
jacked up on this,
like a,

2529
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:07,510
on this energy and it's um,
and what comes up must go down.

2530
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:11,790
So I usually like it.
But then what will happen is I realized

2531
02:01:11,791 --> 02:01:13,550
they know that I've been,
I've exaggerated like,

2532
02:01:13,551 --> 02:01:14,770
oh,
I've gone into something that I had been

2533
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:18,190
too aggressive of a situation or have
been exaggerating some situation where I

2534
02:01:18,191 --> 02:01:22,150
got grind grandiose about something and
I feel super embarrassed that I was in

2535
02:01:22,151 --> 02:01:24,910
this sort of like high and in a way
that.

2536
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:26,860
And I,
and I didn't have my shit together at

2537
02:01:26,861 --> 02:01:28,900
all.
And then I ended up in the downswing,

2538
02:01:28,930 --> 02:01:31,720
which is the,
the catastrophizing,

2539
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:32,660
the like,
uh,

2540
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:34,230
the despair sometimes.
Like,

2541
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:36,790
you know,
I said Lenny lose like that thing about

2542
02:01:36,791 --> 02:01:39,230
being in the center that was talking
about when it's there,

2543
02:01:39,231 --> 02:01:42,890
it's so true and it's so there and all
of a sudden I'm not there at all.

2544
02:01:42,891 --> 02:01:44,150
I don't feel anything.
There's,

2545
02:01:44,151 --> 02:01:47,720
I feel like there's no meaning to
anything and I am just in this

2546
02:01:47,721 --> 02:01:51,890
desolation thing and that last for a few
hours or like a day or something and

2547
02:01:51,891 --> 02:01:55,490
then I'll pop out and I'm fine and I
know that once a week or once every

2548
02:01:55,490 --> 02:01:56,151
week,
two weeks or something,

2549
02:01:56,151 --> 02:01:57,290
I'm going to go into that cycle.

2550
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,990
Now I've done my whole life without
having.

2551
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:02,000
I've tried to manage it entirely with
meditation,

2552
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:05,270
with exercise,
with diet and I may just continue to

2553
02:02:05,271 --> 02:02:07,190
keep doing that.
Have you gotten better at it?

2554
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:09,770
I have got well so I have gotten better
at managing it.

2555
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:12,710
Absolutely no question.
I've gotten way better at not believing

2556
02:02:12,711 --> 02:02:15,680
in it when I'm in a high and not
believing when I'm in the down.

2557
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:17,870
I don't want to interrupt you,
but the thought process,

2558
02:02:17,871 --> 02:02:19,490
like what?
When it kicks in,

2559
02:02:19,491 --> 02:02:21,350
like what?
What are you aware of it?

2560
02:02:21,410 --> 02:02:23,620
So yeah,
it starts as well.

2561
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:25,550
I am because I start this energy in the
body,

2562
02:02:25,551 --> 02:02:27,050
so I feel the vibrating this.
I'm like,

2563
02:02:27,051 --> 02:02:29,450
okay,
that's the first my early warning sign

2564
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:33,350
and then it gets bigger and bigger,
but the thing is it's addictive because

2565
02:02:33,351 --> 02:02:34,640
you do you mind on your heart rate?

2566
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:36,620
While this is how I know,
but I can feel the fucking heart

2567
02:02:36,621 --> 02:02:40,640
sometimes is going like a Jackhammer and
other times the heart it cools out,

2568
02:02:40,641 --> 02:02:44,240
but that it's like the.
I mean the power is still there,

2569
02:02:44,241 --> 02:02:46,790
the feeling of.
And that's that feeling of power which

2570
02:02:46,791 --> 02:02:49,340
is very workout when that hits.
That's too.

2571
02:02:49,341 --> 02:02:51,470
That is what I do.
I hit a punching bag and it's the best.

2572
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:53,210
So I.
This has been the best thing in the

2573
02:02:53,211 --> 02:02:56,870
world for me is been hitting a punching
bag and it's men meditation can't do

2574
02:02:56,871 --> 02:02:58,280
shit when I'm in that place.
Right.

2575
02:02:58,340 --> 02:03:01,130
But punching bag,
I feel calm and centered afterwards.

2576
02:03:01,131 --> 02:03:03,020
So that is the main intervention of what
I'm doing.

2577
02:03:03,290 --> 02:03:07,190
I may never go the med route.
I think I can handle it like I've been

2578
02:03:07,191 --> 02:03:10,580
doing it until now,
but what makes me want to do it is I

2579
02:03:10,581 --> 02:03:12,110
want to know what other people have to
deal with.

2580
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:15,950
Like I want to know what is like to be
on those things and what and so I can

2581
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:19,070
help those people maximally and say,
this is what I can tell you about what

2582
02:03:19,071 --> 02:03:21,890
meditation can do and this is what I can
tell you about what it can't do.

2583
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:24,350
This is what I can tell you about how
physical practice can help,

2584
02:03:24,351 --> 02:03:26,900
but how they might not be able to help.
This is what I can say about how meds

2585
02:03:26,901 --> 02:03:30,080
have helped and it,
but if I can have good experience with

2586
02:03:30,081 --> 02:03:32,600
those different things and talk to lots
of other people who've done it,

2587
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:35,660
then I can triangulate it on helping
people almost in a,

2588
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:38,510
in a more effective way.
So when you get these surges,

2589
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:41,810
you get this energy surge,
you exercise,

2590
02:03:41,811 --> 02:03:43,760
you hit the bag,
you feel great.

2591
02:03:43,870 --> 02:03:45,470
Yeah.
Does that even everything out?

2592
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:46,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

2593
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:48,860
I usually take it can discharge the
energy.

2594
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:50,450
Then why on earth would you be thinking
about?

2595
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:54,020
Well,
that seems insane because then as a very

2596
02:03:54,021 --> 02:03:57,200
organic solution to this problem,
but I don't know that it'll always will

2597
02:03:57,201 --> 02:03:59,420
work with the punching bag.
So it's working right now.

2598
02:03:59,421 --> 02:04:01,160
Right?
It hasn't perfectly worked every time.

2599
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:02,463
What's,
what's.

2600
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:05,840
When you say it hasn't.
Sometimes I go and I hit the bags and

2601
02:04:05,841 --> 02:04:09,320
afterwards the energy's still in me.
It may not have the same edge,

2602
02:04:09,321 --> 02:04:11,600
but it's still.
I can still feel it.

2603
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:15,560
And when you say energy is really
interesting to someone who doesn't get

2604
02:04:15,561 --> 02:04:17,480
the surges I want,
I'm just trying to like,

2605
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:20,390
um.
Do you feel like you're on caffeine?

2606
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:24,350
Do you feel like a speed speed?
It feels like a nowhere.

2607
02:04:24,351 --> 02:04:27,170
So you wake up and you're on speed.
I'm on speed and it's like.

2608
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:28,670
And there's nothing I did externally.

2609
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,260
Nothing happened.
I didn't take anything.

2610
02:04:30,261 --> 02:04:32,670
I didn't do anything all of a sudden.
So this is the things.

2611
02:04:32,690 --> 02:04:35,030
There are corresponding thought process
that goes with this.

2612
02:04:35,031 --> 02:04:38,700
Is there a zest for life is fucking.
Life is awesome to me.

2613
02:04:38,701 --> 02:04:39,900
It's,
I want to go kick some ass.

2614
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,750
It's pure exuberance.
That sounds great.

2615
02:04:42,751 --> 02:04:44,640
It is great.
But that's the problem of it.

2616
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,680
It's great.
So you feed it so you're like,

2617
02:04:46,681 --> 02:04:47,920
you want more of it,
so you just,

2618
02:04:47,950 --> 02:04:50,220
it's like.
So basically it's like this.

2619
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:52,020
It's also not always great for the
people around.

2620
02:04:52,021 --> 02:04:53,190
It's not always great for the people
around.

2621
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:55,110
You were like this,
right?

2622
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:59,820
We have our ups and downs.
This is like from foom foom and the more

2623
02:04:59,821 --> 02:05:02,550
you feed the up,
the higher you go,

2624
02:05:02,580 --> 02:05:04,560
but that means that the bigger you have
the fall.

2625
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:07,350
So like that's what I've learned is that
when I,

2626
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:10,980
when I feed the grandiosity of the
energy that exuberance,

2627
02:05:11,190 --> 02:05:14,130
like I'm super fun to be with at parties
for sure.

2628
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:16,530
Like I'll do crazy shit.
That's usually when I've had all my

2629
02:05:16,531 --> 02:05:18,540
injuries,
my various breaks because I've been on

2630
02:05:18,541 --> 02:05:20,790
one of these crazy high.
So that's another reason not to do it.

2631
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:23,880
But inevitably there's gonna be a part
where it's going to crash.

2632
02:05:23,881 --> 02:05:27,000
So.
So now my whole job is from being a

2633
02:05:27,001 --> 02:05:30,930
meditation teacher is I feel the energy
start to come up and I back off.

2634
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:33,510
So it's like I let it just come through
me,

2635
02:05:33,511 --> 02:05:38,370
I try to let it just come up like a wave
and just and I and I and it's really

2636
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:41,490
uncomfortable being in that vibrating
energy and not acting on it,

2637
02:05:41,491 --> 02:05:45,960
not saying some stupid shit or not like
being more whatever,

2638
02:05:45,961 --> 02:05:48,660
not acting on it and keeping it going.
I have to kind of let it.

2639
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:52,770
So I just try to keep myself calm and
centered and I try to let it just feed

2640
02:05:52,771 --> 02:05:56,580
itself fruit now with the punching bag
or with the biking and with these things

2641
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:58,500
that really can help with that process.

2642
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:01,890
So I do think I might be on the verge of
it.

2643
02:06:01,940 --> 02:06:03,240
Maybe I won't do that,
you know,

2644
02:06:03,241 --> 02:06:05,700
maybe I won't,
but I don't know because it's.

2645
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:08,550
The thing is dude,
it's fucking hard being at tufts to

2646
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:10,740
anyone who is bipolar or be those ups
and downs.

2647
02:06:10,741 --> 02:06:13,740
It's hard to be in that.
It's exhausting every week.

2648
02:06:13,741 --> 02:06:14,820
It's like you don't,
you wake up,

2649
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:16,080
you don't know who you're going to be
this week.

2650
02:06:16,081 --> 02:06:17,670
Who am I going to be today?
Or what?

2651
02:06:17,730 --> 02:06:20,340
Or if you're in a down place,
like now you've made all these plans

2652
02:06:20,341 --> 02:06:21,900
with somebody,
then you got to cancel the plans,

2653
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:23,340
but you,
you're talking,

2654
02:06:23,341 --> 02:06:27,120
you were saying this is a slightly
bipolar situation for you.

2655
02:06:27,410 --> 02:06:29,870
This is so it's not.
I think the bipolar,

2656
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:30,990
I'm not sure.
One of them,

2657
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,370
there's bipolar one,
bipolar two.

2658
02:06:32,371 --> 02:06:37,371
One is more extreme like real mania
where you go and fucking buy 50 couches

2659
02:06:37,741 --> 02:06:38,491
and like,
hey honey,

2660
02:06:38,491 --> 02:06:39,480
I bought 50 couches.

2661
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:40,890
We're going to put couches all over the
neighborhood.

2662
02:06:40,891 --> 02:06:43,320
You know,
like your classic Manic episode.

2663
02:06:43,530 --> 02:06:45,870
It doesn't go for me.
I never had that happen.

2664
02:06:45,871 --> 02:06:47,730
I just have the,
the Hypomania.

2665
02:06:47,731 --> 02:06:51,720
So like the lots of the energy.
But I don't go into total craziness.

2666
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:54,360
And biologically what is the process
like?

2667
02:06:54,361 --> 02:06:57,060
What is actually happening to you that's
causing this?

2668
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:58,650
I don't know.
Um,

2669
02:06:58,950 --> 02:07:00,640
there's no,
they don't understand that.

2670
02:07:01,170 --> 02:07:02,850
I mean,
so this is new for me.

2671
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:04,380
I'm just,
I just found out two weeks.

2672
02:07:04,381 --> 02:07:07,050
So I haven't really done the research on
the brain science yet.

2673
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:10,530
They do say there's a brain signature
just like there is for add,

2674
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:13,680
for bipolar,
there's a particular signature of what,

2675
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:15,600
uh,
of what it looks like.

2676
02:07:15,601 --> 02:07:17,730
It has some kind of dampening of the
frontal activity.

2677
02:07:17,731 --> 02:07:21,420
So probably a lot of activation in maybe
the Amygdala or something.

2678
02:07:21,421 --> 02:07:22,254
I don't know.

2679
02:07:22,410 --> 02:07:24,090
Uh,
all I know is from the inside,

2680
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:26,780
it really feels different.
It feels like a,

2681
02:07:27,290 --> 02:07:28,350
um,
I mean it's,

2682
02:07:28,550 --> 02:07:29,790
I mean,
I'm sure people can relate.

2683
02:07:29,791 --> 02:07:33,030
Like when you've had a coffee and you've
got that vibrating energy or,

2684
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:36,670
or you have or feeling super confident
about yourself,

2685
02:07:36,671 --> 02:07:38,620
but it's almost like your confidence
goes too far.

2686
02:07:39,070 --> 02:07:41,710
You're a little bit like overconfident,
you know,

2687
02:07:41,711 --> 02:07:43,300
you're,
you're delusional,

2688
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:44,400
delusional.
It's a.

2689
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,870
and then that.
And that actually happens in meditation

2690
02:07:46,871 --> 02:07:49,720
to that stage,
the upstage of meditation than to be

2691
02:07:49,721 --> 02:07:52,810
called the arising and passing.
You can get to a stage where suddenly

2692
02:07:52,811 --> 02:07:54,610
you really feel like you get it.
You.

2693
02:07:54,611 --> 02:07:55,510
Oh yeah,
I understand.

2694
02:07:55,511 --> 02:07:56,430
It's like what Dan said.
Yeah,

2695
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:58,210
they're gonna put a fucking plaque here
on the wall.

2696
02:07:58,211 --> 02:08:00,800
I'm the best meditator on the planet.
Like because you got,

2697
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,200
you're just,
you're just,

2698
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:06,970
all the energy is coming through you.
And then inevitably there was the crash.

2699
02:08:06,971 --> 02:08:10,270
So actually that is why I didn't get
diagnosed for so long.

2700
02:08:10,271 --> 02:08:12,550
I thought it was just meditation and
that it was,

2701
02:08:12,610 --> 02:08:16,450
I was just noticing the cycles because
of my meditation and it was really just

2702
02:08:16,451 --> 02:08:19,030
add.
And it wasn't until it started just to

2703
02:08:19,031 --> 02:08:20,320
become.
I started to see,

2704
02:08:20,321 --> 02:08:21,790
okay,
there is a real pattern here.

2705
02:08:21,791 --> 02:08:25,690
Like I need to just talk to somebody and
get some other perspectives on this.

2706
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:30,580
I just might make it worth.
It's worth pointing out that it's highly

2707
02:08:30,581 --> 02:08:34,210
unusual and very courageous for somebody
in juxtaposition.

2708
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:36,250
It's,
it's highly unusual for anybody to talk

2709
02:08:36,251 --> 02:08:39,700
about having mental difficulties at all
in our culture.

2710
02:08:40,090 --> 02:08:42,070
Unfortunately,
we need more people who are willing to

2711
02:08:42,071 --> 02:08:42,940
say,
you know,

2712
02:08:42,941 --> 02:08:45,640
I deal with anxiety,
depression,

2713
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:47,120
bipolar,
um,

2714
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:50,380
add.
But for somebody who's a meditation

2715
02:08:50,381 --> 02:08:54,310
teacher to do it because as jeff has
said that the traditional understanding

2716
02:08:54,311 --> 02:08:58,570
of meditation teacher is someone who's
got their shit together on every level.

2717
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,810
For somebody who's a meditation teacher
to deal to come out and say,

2718
02:09:01,811 --> 02:09:03,310
yeah,
I have these challenges.

2719
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:08,460
He's incredibly brave and also really
important because I think and,

2720
02:09:08,661 --> 02:09:10,420
and,
and working with Jeff on writing this

2721
02:09:10,421 --> 02:09:11,960
book,
one of the things you know,

2722
02:09:11,970 --> 02:09:16,300
there were times when the patterns that
he's describing were very annoying to me

2723
02:09:16,301 --> 02:09:19,420
to deal with as his coauthor,
but over time it actually,

2724
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:22,480
I,
I started to see that he was wrestling

2725
02:09:22,481 --> 02:09:25,780
with this stuff and in many ways it felt
like a meditation teacher.

2726
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,930
It was obvious to me that he is a
meditation teacher with Imposter

2727
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:32,450
Syndrome and now I think he gets in,
I think you can hear it and what he's

2728
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:35,170
saying,
that actually these challenges make them

2729
02:09:35,171 --> 02:09:38,200
a better teacher.
That he's more in touch with the things

2730
02:09:38,201 --> 02:09:39,910
that we're all dealing with and
sometimes on,

2731
02:09:40,580 --> 02:09:45,580
on an exponentially higher level of
degree of difficulty and that therefore

2732
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:49,120
he better at getting under the hood and
helping other people with their mental

2733
02:09:49,121 --> 02:09:49,840
challenge.

2734
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:52,600
Yeah.
Like so in many ways like what you were

2735
02:09:52,601 --> 02:09:56,080
experiencing for your own profession is
almost a gift.

2736
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:57,140
It's why I say,
yeah,

2737
02:09:57,820 --> 02:10:02,800
because you have this unique opportunity
to explore your own consciousness in a

2738
02:10:02,801 --> 02:10:06,730
very challenging way and also to be
completely honest about it,

2739
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:09,940
which is very,
very beneficial to not just your

2740
02:10:09,941 --> 02:10:11,170
students,
but a lot of the people that are

2741
02:10:11,171 --> 02:10:12,820
listening to this right now,
it's now,

2742
02:10:13,090 --> 02:10:16,530
it's now it's living inside the snout
because you get.

2743
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:18,820
It's more.
It just makes everything more dramatic

2744
02:10:18,990 --> 02:10:22,420
so you can see the dynamics because it's
so frigging dramatic and you.

2745
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:25,630
You're then able to see the more subtle
way it plays out for everyone because

2746
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:28,540
the stuff I'm talking about,
it's just the human condition hand.

2747
02:10:28,930 --> 02:10:31,510
Everyone's got [inaudible] is struggling
with a version of this.

2748
02:10:31,511 --> 02:10:34,040
It may not be to that extreme thing,
but they but they got it or they have an

2749
02:10:34,041 --> 02:10:35,510
orthogonal challenge over here.

2750
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:37,580
It's something a little bit different,
so you're.

2751
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:41,060
You're continually training your
compassion for how hard it can be in

2752
02:10:41,061 --> 02:10:42,350
life,
but you're also learning very

2753
02:10:42,351 --> 02:10:44,630
practically how to work with the
dynamics of that stuff.

2754
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:49,400
Is the downside of that,
the reaction to the upside or is there a

2755
02:10:49,401 --> 02:10:53,420
corresponding physical feeling?
I think of it as like a rope,

2756
02:10:53,990 --> 02:10:54,640
like you're,
you know,

2757
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:57,380
you got things like this,
it's just physics will come.

2758
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:01,220
It's just what comes up must come down
and mine is a bit unusual in that it's,

2759
02:11:01,221 --> 02:11:02,810
I'm more up,
I don't have a ton of.

2760
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:05,450
I don't stay down long.
Sounds great.

2761
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:08,150
So that's why it took so long to get
diagnosed.

2762
02:11:08,151 --> 02:11:10,670
But then.
But trust me that being up all is

2763
02:11:10,671 --> 02:11:11,840
deranged too,
you know,

2764
02:11:11,870 --> 02:11:14,480
it's like you're,
you know,

2765
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:16,370
I,
I go back sometimes I had an experience

2766
02:11:16,371 --> 02:11:17,930
where I just was trying to fix up my
website,

2767
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:21,960
look back at an old talk I did and like
that I was videos in this big room and

2768
02:11:21,961 --> 02:11:22,794
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

2769
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:24,030
I was so manic,
you know,

2770
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:25,940
I just thought I was crazy because it's
like,

2771
02:11:25,941 --> 02:11:29,030
what the fuck was I doing about the
memos you sent me when we're in the

2772
02:11:29,031 --> 02:11:31,010
book?
So say some credit.

2773
02:11:31,090 --> 02:11:36,090
What was the,
what was so crazy about the males?

2774
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:37,890
So,
um,

2775
02:11:38,150 --> 02:11:39,230
you know,
I mean,

2776
02:11:39,231 --> 02:11:40,160
do you want to explain it?
Okay.

2777
02:11:40,190 --> 02:11:43,520
So we will be,
this is a book we wrote is for

2778
02:11:43,521 --> 02:11:47,420
beginners.
I wanted it to be really simple and know

2779
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:52,160
we were doing it on a crazy deadline.
So we did a road trip across the country

2780
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:55,880
in January 2017,
so not long ago.

2781
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:59,660
And at the end of the road trip we,
we recorded all of it.

2782
02:11:59,730 --> 02:12:03,230
We got the transcripts back and we had
to hand the book in in June.

2783
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:06,260
That set me up on a schedule where I had
to write a chapter a week,

2784
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:10,280
which is insane because I have an anchor
to shows at ABC and I have a wife and a

2785
02:12:10,281 --> 02:12:13,460
child and it will be insane even if I
didn't have that.

2786
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:16,340
And so my job was to write the
narrative,

2787
02:12:16,341 --> 02:12:19,010
the overarching structure of the book
and Jeff was going to write the

2788
02:12:19,011 --> 02:12:21,200
meditation instructions that got
inserted in.

2789
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:25,970
And all I wanted from him was to give me
some basic fucking meditation

2790
02:12:25,971 --> 02:12:26,480
instructions.

2791
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:31,480
I did not want an exit Jesus on,
on like the pawnee shots,

2792
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,610
you know,
like I didn't need him to go through and

2793
02:12:34,611 --> 02:12:38,920
explain to me like the whole Pali Canon
from Buddhism or the,

2794
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:42,050
you know,
do his version of the Bhagavad Gita.

2795
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:46,520
But he would send me these memos with
his grandiose,

2796
02:12:46,521 --> 02:12:49,550
he'd be on a medic upswing,
but he would have these ideas about how

2797
02:12:49,730 --> 02:12:52,700
he was going to explain meditation as
it's never been explained before as a

2798
02:12:52,701 --> 02:12:55,130
series of exfoliation of the mind,
blah,

2799
02:12:55,131 --> 02:12:55,821
blah,
blah.

2800
02:12:55,821 --> 02:12:59,840
17 page,
17 pages of life of like tightly,

2801
02:13:00,110 --> 02:13:01,740
you know,
because like you get the energy comes up

2802
02:13:01,741 --> 02:13:04,010
and he gets super excited.
Now I'm just pumped and want to talk

2803
02:13:04,011 --> 02:13:07,100
about all these little kind of like a
complicated bits and put it all together

2804
02:13:07,101 --> 02:13:10,430
and create this really elaborate
scaffolding and a metaphor to describe

2805
02:13:10,431 --> 02:13:11,740
exactly how the mind works.
And,

2806
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:13,720
and that's why,
you know,

2807
02:13:14,010 --> 02:13:16,090
that's why I had,
that's why I didn't get the book done

2808
02:13:16,091 --> 02:13:18,790
before I was working on with Dan.
I spent 10 years working on this book

2809
02:13:18,791 --> 02:13:20,710
about enlightenment,
about the,

2810
02:13:20,711 --> 02:13:22,900
about the progress of insight and
meditation.

2811
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:26,500
And I just kept getting more and more
complicated and more because I kept.

2812
02:13:26,860 --> 02:13:29,170
I would kind of simplify it and get.
It'd be very sane.

2813
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:31,260
I have it all understood.
And then I would suddenly go one of

2814
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:32,250
those episodes

2815
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:34,010
and it would,
I would explode it all and like

2816
02:13:34,290 --> 02:13:37,650
elaborate whole new dimensions of stuff
and it was like I would never get

2817
02:13:37,651 --> 02:13:39,000
anything done,
you know,

2818
02:13:39,010 --> 02:13:41,160
and,
and I want to say in your defense that

2819
02:13:41,161 --> 02:13:42,480
the memo,
because I've gone back and read the

2820
02:13:42,481 --> 02:13:43,980
memos,
they're great.

2821
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:48,930
It's just not what I needed while
writing a very simple book on a deadline

2822
02:13:48,990 --> 02:13:50,620
and I would get these memos,
I look,

2823
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:55,080
I don't know what to do with this and,
and so that actually you're putting

2824
02:13:55,090 --> 02:13:57,750
your.
So that is the reason why the ops are

2825
02:13:57,751 --> 02:13:59,550
challenging because when you're in an
up,

2826
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:01,660
you're not really seeing the world as it
is.

2827
02:14:01,860 --> 02:14:04,230
Like this is a person who needs a very
particular thing.

2828
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:07,110
If you're just centered,
you know that you respond with that,

2829
02:14:07,111 --> 02:14:11,460
but you're in your own story about
something and that is the part that's so

2830
02:14:11,461 --> 02:14:15,840
pernicious or are dangerous about,
about the ops and you know,

2831
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:17,190
and so that.

2832
02:14:17,190 --> 02:14:18,810
And that happened in the process.
We're going to book,

2833
02:14:18,811 --> 02:14:20,700
but then we got to sort it out.
But yeah,

2834
02:14:20,701 --> 02:14:21,660
of course,
of course,

2835
02:14:21,661 --> 02:14:23,730
I know there's something about,
um,

2836
02:14:24,270 --> 02:14:26,890
being on an upswing like that and in
this kind of,

2837
02:14:27,030 --> 02:14:28,890
for everybody,
it's not just jeff and we're picking on

2838
02:14:28,891 --> 02:14:29,930
Jeff here,
but when we,

2839
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:35,030
any of us is on an upswing or any of us
has just caught in any mental state.

2840
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:36,590
Your,
your,

2841
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:39,840
your capacity for empathy and compassion
goes way down because you're stuck in

2842
02:14:39,841 --> 02:14:42,360
your own story.
And uh,

2843
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:45,180
the name of the game here at the end of
the day,

2844
02:14:45,181 --> 02:14:49,860
not withstanding by already stated,
misgivings about words like compassion.

2845
02:14:50,130 --> 02:14:54,360
That is where the rubber hits the road
because you can talk about performance

2846
02:14:54,361 --> 02:14:58,740
that is important.
But I think the real measuring stick for

2847
02:14:58,741 --> 02:15:01,710
how well you've trained your mind is,
are you an asshole?

2848
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:05,640
Yeah,
that's huge,

2849
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:06,630
right?
Like,

2850
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:09,890
how well are you interacting with other
people?

2851
02:15:10,710 --> 02:15:13,710
That is the money.
Do you care enough about other people to

2852
02:15:13,711 --> 02:15:15,230
actually see who they are?
Yes.

2853
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:17,390
To see the character in their face,
the,

2854
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:18,010
you know,
what,

2855
02:15:18,010 --> 02:15:20,930
what they're really telling you.
Can you actually get out of your.

2856
02:15:20,931 --> 02:15:23,700
You just get out of your own bullshit
and see what's going on in front of you.

2857
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:25,690
That's the name of the game.
Right,

2858
02:15:25,691 --> 02:15:28,770
and in the most awkward conversation did
you ever have or when people were just

2859
02:15:28,771 --> 02:15:30,040
talking at you?
Exactly.

2860
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:32,010
Did Not even taking you into
consideration.

2861
02:15:32,011 --> 02:15:33,570
Yes.
Why would you even talk to that person

2862
02:15:33,571 --> 02:15:34,230
anyway?
You're not.

2863
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:35,460
They're not.
They're just talking to themselves,

2864
02:15:35,490 --> 02:15:37,230
but you got to.
For me,

2865
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:39,720
it's about what this journey is often
about.

2866
02:15:39,721 --> 02:15:41,250
Journey is another word that I don't
really like,

2867
02:15:41,251 --> 02:15:43,980
but what this exploration is all about.

2868
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:45,540
Adventure,
whatever you want to call it.

2869
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:49,260
As I see sometimes I'm that guy,
I'm that guy.

2870
02:15:49,261 --> 02:15:51,900
I'm not really listening,
and you got to see that.

2871
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:56,940
You have to see that stuff in yourself
instead of just complaining about it in

2872
02:15:56,941 --> 02:16:00,930
others in order to really get to the,
to the good stuff,

2873
02:16:00,931 --> 02:16:05,130
which is actually then learning how to
listen and it's also like we're talking

2874
02:16:05,131 --> 02:16:06,810
about.
It's very important for people to hear

2875
02:16:06,811 --> 02:16:09,820
because everybody's that guy sometimes.
Exactly.

2876
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:13,500
We may not want to admit it,
and many of us liked to spend a lot of

2877
02:16:13,501 --> 02:16:16,200
time complaining about how everybody
else is a Schmuck,

2878
02:16:16,230 --> 02:16:19,610
but you got to see that stuff.
It gets back to the snout,

2879
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:21,120
man.
You got to see that stuff,

2880
02:16:21,210 --> 02:16:23,820
uh,
because actually that's the good stuff.

2881
02:16:23,850 --> 02:16:25,710
It's actually,
there can be a real pleasure,

2882
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:30,100
truly a pleasure in seeing it.
There's a great expression from this

2883
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:34,240
eminent spiritual teacher named Rom Dasa
lives in Hawaii for your.

2884
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:35,710
Many of your listeners may have heard of
him.

2885
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:40,420
He talks about how meditation doesn't
conquer your neuroses.

2886
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:43,300
It makes you a connoisseur of your
neuroses.

2887
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:44,910
You're like a Somali,
a,

2888
02:16:44,911 --> 02:16:48,040
of your own insanity.
And there's a real pleasure every time

2889
02:16:48,041 --> 02:16:51,860
you see a anger come up,
uh,

2890
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:55,180
or your own selfishness come up.
Oh,

2891
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:58,360
I see you.
I see that there's a real pleasure in

2892
02:16:58,361 --> 02:17:00,460
that because then in the scene you're
then not owned,

2893
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:02,530
but you're not in it.
You're not in it.

2894
02:17:04,270 --> 02:17:07,360
That's playing the game well,
and that's what this game is.

2895
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:09,710
Now,
for the uninitiated,

2896
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:14,740
all this is very hard to absorb.
They're sitting back and listening this

2897
02:17:15,111 --> 02:17:19,250
long conversation and trying to put all
these pieces together.

2898
02:17:20,310 --> 02:17:25,310
What's the best first step to take
actually try meditation is the is the

2899
02:17:26,161 --> 02:17:29,130
best step to take and here's the thing
to know.

2900
02:17:29,131 --> 02:17:33,840
This doesn't require a ton of time.
I often point out to people that have

2901
02:17:33,841 --> 02:17:36,840
five to 10 minute a day habit is a great
habit.

2902
02:17:36,841 --> 02:17:38,880
I've spent.
Everybody wants to know what's the least

2903
02:17:38,881 --> 02:17:42,960
amount of meditation I can do and get
the advertise benefits of meditation.

2904
02:17:42,990 --> 02:17:45,180
All this stuff we've been talking about
in high minded terms,

2905
02:17:45,181 --> 02:17:48,390
but there are some easier to comprehend
benefits from meditation,

2906
02:17:48,391 --> 02:17:50,340
lower blood pressure,
boosted immune system,

2907
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:54,000
literally rewiring key parts of the
brain that has to do with focus and

2908
02:17:54,001 --> 02:17:56,970
things like that.
People want to know what's the least I

2909
02:17:56,971 --> 02:17:58,980
can do to get that good stuff.
I spent.

2910
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:02,640
We haven't cracked that by we.
I mean the scientific community that

2911
02:18:02,641 --> 02:18:04,440
studies meditation.
I'm actually part of it,

2912
02:18:04,441 --> 02:18:06,390
but uh,
I know a lot of these men and women,

2913
02:18:06,810 --> 02:18:08,730
they haven't figured out exactly what it
is,

2914
02:18:08,731 --> 02:18:11,880
what's the minimum dose,
but I've asked them,

2915
02:18:11,881 --> 02:18:13,020
you know,
it's five to 10 minutes,

2916
02:18:13,021 --> 02:18:17,760
probably enough in the general consensus
is probably enough to derive many of

2917
02:18:17,761 --> 02:18:18,594
these benefits.

2918
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:21,740
But so that's the good news.
But I think the even better news is if

2919
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:23,490
five to 10 minutes sounds like too much
for you,

2920
02:18:23,730 --> 02:18:27,560
one minute most days,
one minute daily ish,

2921
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:30,720
is really enough to see what you need to
see.

2922
02:18:31,650 --> 02:18:33,450
What you need to see is that you're
fucking crazy.

2923
02:18:34,650 --> 02:18:38,070
You need to see it over and over again.
This is the schnauzer getting his snout

2924
02:18:38,071 --> 02:18:39,750
put in,
in the poop.

2925
02:18:40,110 --> 02:18:43,050
You need to have that happen to you over
and over again.

2926
02:18:43,051 --> 02:18:45,060
Why?
Because every time you see that,

2927
02:18:45,061 --> 02:18:47,490
every time you sit,
try to focus on your breath.

2928
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:50,940
See that you've become distracted in
that moment.

2929
02:18:51,450 --> 02:18:54,720
That's the moment when most people think
I've failed at meditation is actually

2930
02:18:54,721 --> 02:18:57,360
the victory and when you see how crazy
you are,

2931
02:18:57,570 --> 02:19:01,050
when you've become distracted and learn
how to start again and again and again.

2932
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:03,870
Every time you see that you've become
distracted.

2933
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:08,910
That's a win and it when have really
towering consequences because then you

2934
02:19:08,911 --> 02:19:12,090
see that you don't have to be owned by
all that craziness.

2935
02:19:12,220 --> 02:19:14,650
You can recognize it.
You could nip it in its tracks.

2936
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:17,860
Another thing that I think that people
should take into consideration about

2937
02:19:17,861 --> 02:19:22,840
this talk of this meditation and trying
to manage the mind is that one of the

2938
02:19:22,841 --> 02:19:26,320
big issues and struggles that we faced
with today is addiction to social media.

2939
02:19:26,780 --> 02:19:29,900
It's a giant and it is the exact
opposite of meditation.

2940
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:36,010
It is this constant like clicking and
being distracted and just getting all

2941
02:19:38,961 --> 02:19:41,510
this weird input from stuff and it's
not.

2942
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:45,890
I enjoy social media on occasion,
but you got to recognize that this is

2943
02:19:45,891 --> 02:19:49,610
something that can overwhelm your
consciousness

2944
02:19:49,810 --> 02:19:52,700
and I'm not going to present myself as
holier than thou and this because I to

2945
02:19:52,701 --> 02:19:54,620
enjoy it and sometimes I take it too
far.

2946
02:19:54,621 --> 02:19:58,700
There's no question about it.
I'll get lost in social media where

2947
02:19:58,701 --> 02:20:02,630
meditation is useful is because again,
what your training is self awareness.

2948
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:06,650
You're just training to see your own
stuff clearly so that it doesn't own you

2949
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:10,490
met in the course of meditation it
because if you have some meditation

2950
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:15,410
under the belt when you're so deep in a
twitter whole that you're,

2951
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:16,313
uh,
you know,

2952
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:20,330
spent three hours on the thing.
Maybe meditation can kick in at some

2953
02:20:20,331 --> 02:20:20,901
point and say,
oh,

2954
02:20:20,901 --> 02:20:24,170
my stomach is bubbling,
my head is aching.

2955
02:20:24,171 --> 02:20:26,450
I haven't eaten.
I'm not ignoring my children.

2956
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:29,720
And you can pull yourself out of the
spiral and you just get better and

2957
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:32,660
better at doing that.
I don't think perfection is on offer.

2958
02:20:32,660 --> 02:20:35,420
I don't know that all of us are gonna
live like Shin Zen young,

2959
02:20:35,421 --> 02:20:38,550
where the university is just bubbling up
through us all the time.

2960
02:20:38,551 --> 02:20:41,510
When we're not enemies,
I'm editing for 50 years.

2961
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:43,220
Okay,
so great.

2962
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:45,350
That's nice to have those aspirational
figures out there.

2963
02:20:45,351 --> 02:20:47,960
It's also great to have masters out
there who can get in and help us with

2964
02:20:47,961 --> 02:20:51,920
our meditation practice for most of us
at a level of five to 10 minutes a day

2965
02:20:51,921 --> 02:20:54,290
or one minute a day or one minute.
Most days.

2966
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:57,710
It's just that you're going to become
marginally less of a schmuck and that's

2967
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:01,490
really valuable and it does not have to
be complicated.

2968
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:04,310
Sit down for five minutes.
Do it for 10 minutes.

2969
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:07,460
Notice your breath.
Then we get distracted to come back.

2970
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:09,470
Notice what got you distracted.
That's it.

2971
02:21:09,710 --> 02:21:11,600
You do that.
You'll find your own way into these

2972
02:21:11,601 --> 02:21:12,110
insights.

2973
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:16,010
You know you will start to learn how it
works and this is take the time to do

2974
02:21:16,011 --> 02:21:17,960
that and you don't even have to do it in
a sitting practice.

2975
02:21:17,961 --> 02:21:19,970
You could do it,
you know when you're exercising or

2976
02:21:19,971 --> 02:21:21,410
something.
It's just harder to do it when there's

2977
02:21:21,411 --> 02:21:24,590
more going on.
I mean normally we lead with that,

2978
02:21:25,310 --> 02:21:28,540
but since you're a beautiful Weirdo,
you took us into all sorts of.

2979
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:32,870
Weird spaces and that's where we went
first and Jeff is in my view,

2980
02:21:32,871 --> 02:21:37,430
one of the best people in the world at
talking about meditation at the deep

2981
02:21:37,431 --> 02:21:39,950
end,
but normally we lead with what we just

2982
02:21:39,951 --> 02:21:40,890
discussed,
but you know,

2983
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:43,153
such is life.

2984
02:21:43,350 --> 02:21:45,930
Well,
I think that this is an important aspect

2985
02:21:45,931 --> 02:21:50,931
of it to focus on that social media use
and this addiction that we have is

2986
02:21:51,330 --> 02:21:56,330
literally the exact opposite of this
mindfulness and meditation and really

2987
02:21:56,910 --> 02:22:01,380
concentrating on being completely free
of all these,

2988
02:22:01,610 --> 02:22:05,130
these devices and things that you're
distracting yourself.

2989
02:22:05,410 --> 02:22:09,550
Thing to think.
It's like living is making habits.

2990
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:14,620
What habits are reinforcing you are what
you repeatedly do you.

2991
02:22:14,650 --> 02:22:17,470
So if you are just completely.
If you're training your attention to be

2992
02:22:17,471 --> 02:22:19,900
fragmented,
it's gonna only get more fragmented

2993
02:22:20,110 --> 02:22:22,090
because of the things just keep
changing.

2994
02:22:22,091 --> 02:22:24,550
They get deeper and deeper and deeper.
So at some point you need to start

2995
02:22:24,551 --> 02:22:26,250
training a different set

2996
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:27,180
of circuits.
You know,

2997
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:29,850
it's just about that.
It's about what you're going to train

2998
02:22:29,851 --> 02:22:32,820
and what you're not going to train.
Most of us don't think of life that way.

2999
02:22:33,090 --> 02:22:35,760
We land in life and you just start doing
stuff,

3000
02:22:35,761 --> 02:22:38,190
but the things you're doing are the
things that are going to become your

3001
02:22:38,191 --> 02:22:41,220
inevitable conditioning and that's a
very sobering thought,

3002
02:22:41,490 --> 02:22:44,580
but it's also liberating thought because
it shows you that if you can start to do

3003
02:22:44,850 --> 02:22:47,520
the stuff that's better for you,
better for your brain,

3004
02:22:47,521 --> 02:22:50,220
your body,
then you can start to reverse that stuff

3005
02:22:50,221 --> 02:22:51,054
as well.
Right.

3006
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:52,410
Amen.
To what you just hadn't.

3007
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:57,440
Just to amplify your point about this,
the mindless use of social media being

3008
02:22:58,981 --> 02:23:00,810
the opposite of meditation.
I actually think there's.

3009
02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:02,910
It's interesting.
I think the proliferation of

3010
02:23:02,911 --> 02:23:07,911
communication technology is in part why
meditation has become so in vogue

3011
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:12,370
because people know on some level
whether they can,

3012
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:16,260
whether they can articulate it or not,
it's something's wrong.

3013
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:19,950
We are.
This is really interesting woman minutia

3014
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:23,730
Zomorodi who has a podcast called note
to self and it's about all about our

3015
02:23:23,731 --> 02:23:25,840
relationship with technology and I was
talking to her recently.

3016
02:23:25,870 --> 02:23:28,620
She said,
we're conducting this massive science

3017
02:23:28,621 --> 02:23:32,930
experiment with these devices and we
don't know what the outcome's going to

3018
02:23:32,931 --> 02:23:36,000
be,
but it's happening globally and people

3019
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:39,990
have a sense that something's off.
And that I think is why meditation has

3020
02:23:39,991 --> 02:23:41,190
become such a.
But you know,

3021
02:23:41,191 --> 02:23:43,950
actually I think what I think is really
interesting is if you guys heard of the

3022
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:46,060
slow technology movement,
um,

3023
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:50,510
there's a few different ideas around
this slow design or the basic idea is

3024
02:23:50,511 --> 02:23:52,730
that right now the interfaces that we
use,

3025
02:23:52,731 --> 02:23:54,500
these flat screens,
these,

3026
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:56,900
uh,
and all the notifications,

3027
02:23:56,901 --> 02:23:58,820
the buzzing,
the flickers that's kind of blowing our

3028
02:23:58,821 --> 02:24:01,840
attention apart,
but that it's true.

3029
02:24:01,850 --> 02:24:04,250
So it's training the brain and the mind
and a particular kind of way.

3030
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:08,240
But in the exact same spirit,
if you were to start to design these

3031
02:24:08,241 --> 02:24:11,840
interfaces in a way that according to
basic mental health principles,

3032
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:15,620
you might be able to create a more
positive habits.

3033
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:19,490
So it's just starting to think like
actually how could we design our to our

3034
02:24:19,491 --> 02:24:22,280
devices?
Our interfaces are technology in a way

3035
02:24:22,281 --> 02:24:26,630
that's promoting a more happiness,
more connection,

3036
02:24:26,631 --> 02:24:28,790
more of all the good stuff.
And that's a good question.

3037
02:24:28,791 --> 02:24:31,490
People are just starting to ask and I
think it's really,

3038
02:24:31,550 --> 02:24:34,580
really cool to like think,
think about things in that way that

3039
02:24:34,581 --> 02:24:36,170
it's.
It could be an opportunity,

3040
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:39,050
there could be an opportunity with these
with the technologies to do something

3041
02:24:39,051 --> 02:24:40,750
really awesome.
So it's not like it's,

3042
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:43,970
it's because they're neutral in a way.
It's just a tool.

3043
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:45,110
It's how you use it.
The

3044
02:24:45,110 --> 02:24:48,890
tool and the way in which the tools
designed for allegation is that actually

3045
02:24:48,980 --> 02:24:53,980
many of these devices and platforms have
been designed specifically to me,

3046
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:58,790
but that's not neutral.
They're like they're salty potato chips.

3047
02:24:58,820 --> 02:25:00,100
You can't stop eating.
Yeah,

3048
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:04,520
I'm a but I will just put in one plug.
But while we're waiting for slow

3049
02:25:04,521 --> 02:25:08,570
technology to come to fruition,
there are ways that it's on us as users

3050
02:25:08,571 --> 02:25:12,950
to use these things wisely.
One thing I would say is as somebody who

3051
02:25:12,951 --> 02:25:17,360
does use twitter and instagram is a,
there's a great tweet from this guy,

3052
02:25:17,361 --> 02:25:20,330
Ian Bremmer who,
who's a big thinker about current

3053
02:25:20,331 --> 02:25:22,370
affairs.
His.

3054
02:25:22,371 --> 02:25:25,150
I think his pin tweet is something like
a.

3055
02:25:25,450 --> 02:25:27,640
If you're only following people you
agree with,

3056
02:25:27,700 --> 02:25:31,810
you're doing it wrong and I think
there's a way in which actually are

3057
02:25:31,811 --> 02:25:33,390
social media use in,
in,

3058
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:38,440
in that we create these cocoons bubbles,
ideological echo chambers were only

3059
02:25:39,191 --> 02:25:42,610
following people who give us visceral,
satisfying,

3060
02:25:42,670 --> 02:25:43,900
ideological red meat.

3061
02:25:44,290 --> 02:25:49,290
If in fact you can use these platforms
and podcasts to listen to people with

3062
02:25:49,811 --> 02:25:52,090
whom you disagree and maybe you
communicate with them.

3063
02:25:52,330 --> 02:25:56,980
Then actually that is a thoughtful and
wise use of this technology and may

3064
02:25:56,981 --> 02:25:59,470
solve some.
What I would argue is the biggest

3065
02:25:59,471 --> 02:26:00,970
problem this country is facing right
now,

3066
02:26:00,971 --> 02:26:03,040
which is toxic,
tribalism.

3067
02:26:03,490 --> 02:26:05,830
Toxic tribalism is a really good way of
putting it.

3068
02:26:06,470 --> 02:26:08,440
That's like your.
Everyone's just stuck in their own

3069
02:26:08,441 --> 02:26:11,230
facebook feeds.
It's basically the facebook feed is your

3070
02:26:11,231 --> 02:26:12,220
reality.
Yeah,

3071
02:26:12,221 --> 02:26:15,580
but you can use facebook to connect with
your neighbors,

3072
02:26:15,581 --> 02:26:16,480
you know,
disagree with you,

3073
02:26:16,481 --> 02:26:21,481
and to actually be able to hear their
arguments in a way that isn't blindly

3074
02:26:23,471 --> 02:26:25,900
reactive.
It's about doing the rounds of the

3075
02:26:25,901 --> 02:26:28,900
community.
Can you actually go out there and do the

3076
02:26:28,901 --> 02:26:31,060
rounds of the video and check out some
different perspectives?

3077
02:26:31,190 --> 02:26:32,740
Yeah,
absolutely.

3078
02:26:33,330 --> 02:26:36,480
I think that's very important.
I do that a lot.

3079
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:37,110
I,
I,

3080
02:26:37,110 --> 02:26:38,610
I,
I follow a lot of people that don't

3081
02:26:38,611 --> 02:26:42,030
agree with and I also try to talk to a
lot of people that don't agree with.

3082
02:26:42,031 --> 02:26:46,560
I think that's also important to and to
have some sort of common ground where

3083
02:26:46,561 --> 02:26:50,880
you can explore the ideas themselves and
not look at the person who presents the

3084
02:26:50,881 --> 02:26:53,640
ideas as your enemy.
That's a real problem today in this

3085
02:26:53,641 --> 02:26:54,421
country.
Obviously.

3086
02:26:54,421 --> 02:26:56,700
I agree.
We've never been more divided in terms

3087
02:26:56,701 --> 02:27:01,701
of right left and the ideologies and
especially when you have such a divisive

3088
02:27:02,941 --> 02:27:04,440
president.
I mean you have this,

3089
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:09,520
this person at the very top of the heap
who literally chastises people and mocks

3090
02:27:10,711 --> 02:27:12,390
them on twitter.
I mean you have a,

3091
02:27:12,391 --> 02:27:16,350
a mocking insulting president.
It's fucked up.

3092
02:27:16,450 --> 02:27:20,490
Who uses social media and there's a
trickle down from that.

3093
02:27:21,210 --> 02:27:24,050
Unquestionably.
There's people that look to the guy who

3094
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:27,600
was at the top of the food chain as
being the one who we should model

3095
02:27:27,601 --> 02:27:29,490
ourselves after in some way,
shape or form.

3096
02:27:29,790 --> 02:27:33,450
And so the idea that people are leaning
in that direction now where they weren't

3097
02:27:33,451 --> 02:27:36,240
for eight years,
it's weird.

3098
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:40,250
It's a weird time for interaction and
debating ideas.

3099
02:27:40,410 --> 02:27:40,771
Yeah.
Well,

3100
02:27:40,771 --> 02:27:42,280
it's also,
again,

3101
02:27:42,300 --> 02:27:45,540
one of the negative things with social
media is that thing of just like the

3102
02:27:45,541 --> 02:27:47,580
whole trolling thing,
you could just say whatever you want

3103
02:27:47,581 --> 02:27:49,320
because you don't actually have a real
human being right in front.

3104
02:27:49,340 --> 02:27:51,890
You can't see them.
They're hurting either hurt.

3105
02:27:52,250 --> 02:27:56,100
So people are just this unbridled
reactivity that just creates more

3106
02:27:56,130 --> 02:28:00,060
activities into my own twitter feed
snowballs and people saying things to me

3107
02:28:00,061 --> 02:28:02,070
that they.
I doubt they would ever say to my face,

3108
02:28:02,230 --> 02:28:02,720
yeah,

3109
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:04,370
yeah.
I mean that's what we do.

3110
02:28:04,730 --> 02:28:07,370
That's what people do.
And that's one of the things that's so

3111
02:28:07,371 --> 02:28:12,371
bizarre about the lack of social cues.
You're not standing in front of someone.

3112
02:28:12,411 --> 02:28:14,010
There's no consequences.
It's,

3113
02:28:14,060 --> 02:28:19,060
it's communication in incredibly
unnatural and unrealistic way.

3114
02:28:19,700 --> 02:28:23,320
All our lives.
The time that we were monkeys coming out

3115
02:28:23,321 --> 02:28:27,530
of trees are in exchanges,
have been face to face until very

3116
02:28:27,531 --> 02:28:28,364
recently.
Yes.

3117
02:28:28,690 --> 02:28:29,070
Yes.

3118
02:28:29,070 --> 02:28:32,040
And again,
I know we're flogging the meditation

3119
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:36,630
thing and I don't want to present it as
a panacea because it's not and nor is it

3120
02:28:36,631 --> 02:28:40,110
the only approach to increasing the
sanity quotion in our society,

3121
02:28:40,111 --> 02:28:42,570
which badly needs to happen,
but again,

3122
02:28:42,571 --> 02:28:44,730
I do think that meditation,
mindfulness,

3123
02:28:44,731 --> 02:28:48,360
that sort of self awareness that's
generated through meditation can play a

3124
02:28:48,361 --> 02:28:52,470
positive role in this,
the aforementioned toxic tribalism

3125
02:28:52,650 --> 02:28:55,920
because if you're so caught up in your
own story,

3126
02:28:56,160 --> 02:28:57,630
you can't,
as we've discussed,

3127
02:28:57,631 --> 02:29:01,680
have the kind of empathy that is needed
to understand people who have different

3128
02:29:01,681 --> 02:29:06,681
views and meditation is a way among
other techniques to kind of just reduce

3129
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:10,590
how seriously,
how personally you're taking your own

3130
02:29:10,620 --> 02:29:13,500
inner chaos.
And I think that can be very useful

3131
02:29:13,501 --> 02:29:16,020
right now.
Do I think everybody in the world's are

3132
02:29:16,110 --> 02:29:18,540
automatically gonna hurl themselves into
the Lotus position?

3133
02:29:18,541 --> 02:29:21,510
No,
but I think each individual can take a

3134
02:29:21,511 --> 02:29:25,560
personal responsibility for making
things less crazy.

3135
02:29:26,110 --> 02:29:28,630
I agree with you 100 percent.
I think that's a good way to wrap this

3136
02:29:28,631 --> 02:29:29,464
up.
Yeah.

3137
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:31,030
Well good.
Thank you very much.

3138
02:29:31,031 --> 02:29:31,980
Thank [inaudible] else.
You know,

3139
02:29:31,990 --> 02:29:34,720
any.
Anything else to add before we wrap

3140
02:29:34,721 --> 02:29:35,120
this?

3141
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:37,580
Thank you for putting me in the tank.
I really appreciate that.

3142
02:29:37,581 --> 02:29:41,240
There's an expression of gratitude is
the expectation of future favors,

3143
02:29:41,660 --> 02:29:42,130
so

3144
02:29:42,130 --> 02:29:45,490
I expect to be back in that tank anytime
you let me know when you're in town.

3145
02:29:45,491 --> 02:29:49,120
We'll hook it up and by the way,
there's hundreds of tank centers all

3146
02:29:49,121 --> 02:29:49,954
over the country.
I know.

3147
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:51,760
I'm sure you're in New York,
right?

3148
02:29:51,770 --> 02:29:53,080
So they.
I'm sure they have them.

3149
02:29:53,081 --> 02:29:55,600
I know they have them in New York.
They have them all over California now,

3150
02:29:55,601 --> 02:29:57,340
so they're everywhere.
All of the states.

3151
02:29:57,341 --> 02:30:01,480
So find them.
Thank you guys for the book to people.

3152
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:04,480
The title meditation for Fidgety
skeptics.

3153
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:05,860
There you go.
That's it.

3154
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:07,053
Bye everybody.

3155
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:11,510
Three hours.

3156
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,470
Mm.
