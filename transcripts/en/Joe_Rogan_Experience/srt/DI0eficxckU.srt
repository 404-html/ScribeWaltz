1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,670
What the fuck,

3
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:03,061
man,

4
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:03,960
we're a weird,

5
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,013
so weird.

6
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,660
What a stupid culture.

7
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,530
What are you doing?

8
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,080
I can't stop thinking about the guy,

9
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,480
the farted at the sink at the airport.

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,670
We talked about it for
10 minutes afterwards.

11
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,000
Dudes Fart when they pee
and then go to the bathroom.

12
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,070
Constantly far to in public restrooms.

13
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:23,421
Yeah.

14
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:27,660
But we were at the sink and the dude was
washing his hands and he cut a monster

15
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,240
fart.

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,300
And I told Tommy about it and I was like,

17
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:30,751
dude,

18
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:31,584
this guy,

19
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,370
he broke.

20
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,203
He broke the rules.

21
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,320
Yeah.

22
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,010
I walked out just before this happened.

23
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,660
I unfortunately missed the incident,

24
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,000
but you said it immediately and I was,

25
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,180
I kept wrapping my head around it and I
think what I've come to the conclusion

26
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,980
is that if you do that,

27
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,290
all I'm looking for is
for you to acknowledge it.

28
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,390
Oops.

29
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:47,670
Yeah.

30
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,870
You need to say something.

31
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,010
I want you to say something about
that because I was thinking about how,

32
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,281
uh,

33
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:56,370
an old guy one time farted next to me in,

34
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,233
um,

35
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:57,600
uh,

36
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,060
like on a tram and then the airport.

37
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,321
And I was like,

38
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:01,710
Jesus,

39
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,420
he led a fucking pretty big fart.

40
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,100
And I looked at him and he goes,

41
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:05,963
snuck out of me.

42
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,631
I was like,

43
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:06,901
all right.

44
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,570
And I kind of took away like,

45
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,710
you know what was upsetting him that yes.

46
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,271
I was like,

47
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,060
well thank you for acknowledging your,

48
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,060
you're fart right now.

49
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,391
Yeah.

50
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,250
This guy was just washing
his hands and he just,

51
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,030
the sink is not the year.

52
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,310
I don't think they get a pass there.

53
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,761
Yeah,

54
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,390
it was.

55
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:21,690
It was.

56
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,620
Definitely are know who does that to you?

57
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,050
It was definitely a gray area.

58
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,980
It was definitely a greater,

59
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,020
people fart all the time at the urinals.

60
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,960
That's so common.

61
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:29,080
Yeah.

62
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,080
I hear a lot of farms get done zip up
walk all the way around and washing your

63
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:38,670
hands in the middle of Washington as
you just unload and no one said a word.

64
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:38,821
Yeah,

65
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:39,654
everyone just,

66
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,570
just let it go and then we got outside.

67
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:42,961
I was like,

68
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:43,411
Yo Dude,

69
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:44,400
how do you feel about this?

70
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,490
I can't stop thinking of that.

71
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,820
And then we're trying to figure out what
kind of farts girls cut when they're in

72
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:53,490
the bathroom and whether or not they
washed their hands before nine each other.

73
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,170
Probably not as much.

74
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,651
Not as much,

75
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:57,030
but they definitely drop heat in there.

76
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,150
Once they close that door or
then they allow themselves.

77
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,690
Yeah,

78
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,670
they allow themselves to,

79
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,910
to fucking farted up,

80
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,973
let me know.

81
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:05,890
You know,

82
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,810
they really let them rip.

83
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,410
Yeah.

84
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,570
Once they get in that door
that closed that door,

85
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,404
they just,

86
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,011
you have to,

87
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:11,844
if you're taking a shit,

88
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,093
you got to Fart.

89
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,240
But I wonder if they fart while
they're washing their hands.

90
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,610
These are the things that I think of it.

91
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,160
Yeah,

92
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,993
absolutely.

93
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,260
I wonder about what we need
and the more of this moral,

94
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,160
do you mask your farts when you
should shit in a public restaurant?

95
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:23,560
No.

96
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:23,880
No.

97
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,450
Let it out.

98
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,770
You gotta do what you want to hold up

99
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,193
an idiot.

100
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,030
She's Jesus Christ.

101
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:31,020
You have it on your phone.

102
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,670
I love girl farts.

103
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,871
40 year old man.

104
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:34,740
He's got it on his phone.

105
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,633
Oh,

106
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
it's a huge fetish now.

107
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,401
That's actually a website.

108
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,070
It is.

109
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,791
It's amazing.

110
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,510
It always been.

111
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:42,721
Yeah,

112
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:43,321
it's amazing.

113
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,030
There's been far porn forever.

114
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,530
We're dudes like sniff farts,

115
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,580
whatever girl's ass.

116
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,030
I said,

117
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,560
naughty.

118
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,510
We played some a fart clips on our show
and we were talking about it and the guy

119
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,220
wrote in and he was like,

120
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,200
I have a big time fart fetish.

121
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,530
And were what?

122
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,580
Like what's the thinking about it?

123
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,031
And he was like,

124
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:05,620
I think it's just back to the taboo of
it that the pretty girl is not supposed

125
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:05,890
to.

126
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,820
So he's uh,

127
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,451
you know what I mean?

128
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:07,850
Like that it's,

129
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,160
yeah.

130
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,840
To be in a dirty girl and he loves,

131
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:11,021
you know,

132
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,630
a pretty girl doing it is
like the ultimate thing.

133
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,111
Yeah.

134
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,120
That's the thing about people's,

135
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,510
like they want people to be naughty,

136
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,553
right.

137
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,850
Just because we feel so,

138
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,330
most people at least feel
so confined by the rules.

139
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:23,021
And I think women,

140
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,640
so even more so than men,

141
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,710
women even more so than men because,

142
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:26,950
you know,

143
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,920
society wants you to be a lady
and he wants a certain way.

144
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,460
Sure.

145
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:30,791
You know,

146
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,050
and they're slut shaming.

147
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:33,250
You're not allowed to be a slut.

148
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,020
You're not allowed to
do what you want to do.

149
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,600
You know,

150
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,770
like if a woman wants to go out
and fuck a bunch of different guys,

151
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,030
like w have one once a fuck,

152
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:40,900
two guys in a night,

153
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,460
she's a terrible person.

154
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,410
Like if you find out about that,

155
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,831
oh my God,

156
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,120
she and she went to this guy's house,

157
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:46,721
she fucked him.

158
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,210
Then she laughed and she went to this
other guy's house and fucked him.

159
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,310
What a whore national champion.

160
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,121
Like girls would be like,

161
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:52,954
what a whore.

162
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,830
But if you told me,

163
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,360
so he decides he leaves his,

164
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,730
this girl's house and he's like,

165
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:58,151
you know what?

166
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:59,680
Fuck I can call somebody else.

167
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:00,281
You call somebody else.

168
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,031
And he goes and fucks her.

169
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:01,864
And we were like,

170
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,930
great,

171
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,850
you guys an animal.

172
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,580
It wasn't,

173
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,080
it wasn't even done yet.

174
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,490
Wanted to fuck more than,

175
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,280
that is crazy though that we don't,

176
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:09,940
you know,

177
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,711
that we have that,

178
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:11,830
that double standard for that.

179
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,011
I mean,

180
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,900
I remember in college a Guy,

181
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:14,734
a friend,

182
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,280
uh,

183
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,020
going into a sorority house and
banging girls in the same house,

184
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,480
in the same nine different rooms and like,

185
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:22,661
yeah,

186
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,381
we all were like,

187
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,160
that's fantastic.

188
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,580
You're such a hero like yours.

189
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,200
Like we were all so happy with his story.

190
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,540
But if a girl went to a fraternity house,

191
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,920
fuck one guy said goodnight,

192
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,780
honey laughed and then knock the door,

193
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,470
man,

194
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,980
she's fucking under our
attorney fucking whore.

195
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:39,570
Yeah,

196
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,660
we really should applaud her.

197
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,470
You mean?

198
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,400
Well or not,

199
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:42,970
you know,

200
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,160
either way we should let her
do whatever she wants to do.

201
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,610
Yeah.

202
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,810
She just fucking people.

203
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,711
Why do you,

204
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:48,544
what do you care?

205
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,840
Are they going to stay together forever?

206
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,040
They're in college.

207
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,240
Jesus Christ.

208
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,680
If you have a problem with a grower,

209
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,510
will fucks one guy and then
fucks not the guy that night.

210
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,140
You're silly.

211
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,321
Yeah,

212
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:57,154
you are.

213
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:57,791
What's wrong?

214
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,840
Could be one of those guys.

215
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
All you gotta do is throw
your deck in front of her.

216
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:01,990
Obviously she likes him.

217
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,330
So that suppression leads to,

218
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,660
uh,

219
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,660
like a reaction is just holding back
leads to this need to let it go.

220
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,440
And the girl just forks right
in that dude's face guys.

221
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,460
Like if you did,

222
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:18,860
did you dirty bitch dirty farty bitch,

223
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,410
I'm a 40 bitch.

224
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,293
Pardon my mouth.

225
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,411
It's so funny,

226
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,430
the people that own this,

227
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,580
I love girlfriends are
actually Watson right now.

228
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,640
I'm from out that it's all stupid.

229
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,690
Oh my gosh,

230
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:32,530
that's not Canada.

231
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,690
Me and I'm a bad girl.

232
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,520
The smell and the fucking noise and the
whole thing that naughtiness of it all.

233
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,400
We hold it in Boston girls fighting.

234
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,840
We have a thing about,

235
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,320
um,

236
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,780
about people shitting too,

237
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,570
you know,

238
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,000
like no one wants to admit
they just took a shit.

239
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:56,440
We want to hide it and get over it up
with noise and fans and we want to light

240
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,080
matches and yeah,

241
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:58,161
it,

242
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:58,290
it,

243
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,510
it,

244
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,331
it is weird.

245
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,110
I mean,

246
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,100
I don't like,

247
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:01,580
uh,

248
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,160
the single single stall Unisex bathrooms.

249
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,220
When you got to shit,

250
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,961
I got shit.

251
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:06,794
And then there's like,

252
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,221
someone's like,

253
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,060
you're going in there and you're like,

254
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,110
ah fuck man,

255
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,030
why don't you go in first?

256
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,890
I know I get,

257
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,541
but you get that,

258
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:14,841
you know,

259
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,750
like I feel like I can't
relax or you can say,

260
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,250
can I please use the restroom?

261
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,271
If you're at a meeting,

262
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,010
if you're having a meeting or
something like that and you say,

263
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:23,360
I'll be right back off
to use the restroom.

264
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,141
But you can't say,

265
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:24,710
look,

266
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,311
I've got to shit.

267
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,660
I gotta I can't keep talking to you guys.

268
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,494
I gotta take a shit.

269
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,970
You say I use the restroom.

270
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,631
It's ambiguous.

271
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:29,811
Okay,

272
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:30,220
go ahead.

273
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,470
Yeah.

274
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,303
And you leave,

275
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,030
you know,

276
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,571
you can't say,

277
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:34,850
I'm so sorry I was late for this meeting.

278
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,990
I got here on time,

279
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,740
but I had to shit.

280
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,100
Yeah,

281
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,461
right,

282
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:37,730
right.

283
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,560
You can't say that I would be upset.

284
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,320
You've got to go to the
restroom and then you,

285
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:42,500
you know that the clock's running.

286
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,251
So,

287
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,250
cause if you come back 15 minutes
later it covered in sweat.

288
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,461
They're like,

289
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:46,611
wow,

290
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,630
you took a monster shit.

291
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:48,110
Huh?

292
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,810
Like you can't really put that out there.

293
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,111
You're like,

294
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:51,601
oh fuck,

295
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:52,880
now I got to grind this thing out quick.

296
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,530
Sometimes that's what you have to do.

297
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,360
Sometimes you have to
take a 10 minute heater.

298
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,800
Like sometimes you just,

299
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,390
you take a shit and it comes up clump,

300
00:06:59,391 --> 00:06:59,691
clump,

301
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:00,021
and you're like,

302
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:00,261
God,

303
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,220
there's a lot more up there.

304
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,590
God dammit happened on
the flight yesterday.

305
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,431
Oh No.

306
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,920
As soon as I sat down and was one of them
wanting to go to sleep and I was like,

307
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,880
I gotta take a shit.

308
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,070
And it was during takeoff.

309
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,290
So then you're like waiting
for it to hit 10,000 feet,

310
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:12,891
you know,

311
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,251
and then you're,

312
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,830
you're waiting for them to
turn the seatbelt sign off.

313
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,240
And I go in there like,

314
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,290
this is going to be,

315
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,160
this is like a fucking marathon shit.

316
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,910
But I didn't have time for it,

317
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,490
so I really dropped half of it
off just like a fall asleep.

318
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,380
Oh No.

319
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,210
And then later on I finished.

320
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:29,930
It was,

321
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,530
it was pretty,

322
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,161
pretty dramatic.

323
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:33,980
It's one of the weird things about
your body is that there's like this

324
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:36,800
intangible sense of how
much shit is in there.

325
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:37,871
You know,

326
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:39,620
like when you're taking a shit,

327
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,330
like you have that feeling,

328
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:45,530
that weird feeling like I smell a shit
or I feel shit bro and I feel a shit

329
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,364
cooking in the oven.

330
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,170
And then once you're taking that shit
you got this pressure thing like you know

331
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:53,870
it's in there and you know what's up there
and there's a certain amount like God

332
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,171
damn it,

333
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,004
this isn't ready.

334
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,060
This is his diet it.

335
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:56,240
Yeah.

336
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,540
All right.

337
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,320
I'm going to have to,

338
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,750
I'm going to have to up to empty
it and then I'll come back later.

339
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,790
Yeah.

340
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,100
And that's,

341
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,900
and that's the worst you'd
like when it's all gone.

342
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,763
Yeah.

343
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Certain foods to will trigger
just amazing amounts of shit.

344
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,490
The commodity you where you're just like,

345
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,110
is my body mostly shit?

346
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,830
Like am I just a walking
talking shit machine?

347
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,350
Because sometimes I'll like,

348
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:21,380
the amount that will come out
of me is just incredible to me.

349
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,100
I cannot get over what's coming out of me.

350
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,750
If you think about how
much food you eat though,

351
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,260
if you sink,

352
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,620
sink,

353
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,360
think of like the your entire day.

354
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:33,830
If you shit once a day thinking about
breakfast in there and then lunch in there

355
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,180
and then your dinner in there,

356
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:40,181
like this giant mound of food that
goes into your body and then snack,

357
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,740
like you might have a protein bar along
the way and then you'll have all this

358
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,880
you drink thing.

359
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:47,540
He might drink milk which has got some
solids in there and then slowly but

360
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,470
surely compress that into just laws.

361
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,480
Big ropey shit logs.

362
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,051
It's amazing.

363
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:54,950
It's not really bigger.

364
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,140
Now picture a pretty girl squatting
over your face and letting that all over

365
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:58,974
you.

366
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,453
Ooh,

367
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,310
well that's a under glass like big thing.

368
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,170
People guys coffee from guys like
women shitting on class coffee tables.

369
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,093
Yeah,

370
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,960
I mean I always heard that about Stallone.

371
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,880
Those,

372
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,960
those like one of those
rumors probably made up.

373
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,670
It's probably like the
Richard Gere durable thing.

374
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:18,110
Yeah.

375
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,570
Someone decided to to say
it and then it sounds cool.

376
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,560
So people are repeat it.

377
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:22,871
Yeah,

378
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:24,040
it was still own likes.

379
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,620
She likes to get under tables and girls
take big juicy shifts on those tables.

380
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:30,000
She loves him cause you want to fuck them.

381
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,170
Just wants them to shit.

382
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,490
I'd like to watch people,

383
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:33,070
Shit.

384
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,310
It's over a glass table
just to see it come out.

385
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,290
Maybe once for sure.

386
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,610
What about a guy like Joey Diaz,

387
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,160
which I think that's the one that
would be at the top of my list.

388
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,340
What if he fell and landed on a table
on the table shattered and you died.

389
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,471
That'd be horrible.

390
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,380
Class went through.

391
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:50,010
Your next shit was in your eyeballs and
you'd died knowing that shit was all

392
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:51,320
over your face and feeling the,

393
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:53,070
the hot blood rush out of your neck.

394
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,933
Wow.

395
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,540
I slept at too much sodium.

396
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,480
I think that it would be much more
interesting to watch the shit.

397
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,410
Then some model.

398
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,770
I'd like to see him have explosive
diarrhea on a glass table.

399
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,131
Well,

400
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:08,610
I would like to see a girl who's
like addicted to stimulants,

401
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,530
like who's trying to be really skinny.

402
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,040
How just how little she actually
shifts my hair comes out.

403
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,320
Probably shocking to see
like a little tiny poops.

404
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,890
Curly squarely turned slightly bile.

405
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,010
The yellow smell to it.

406
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,900
Like what's going on?

407
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,190
Yeah.

408
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,551
Sorry.

409
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:24,250
That's a big one.

410
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,083
Anything.

411
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,730
Half of her shit,

412
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:27,564
his pills,

413
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,310
how do come out?

414
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:31,900
Yeah.

415
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,840
Like non dissolved pills.

416
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,633
Clumps.

417
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,301
Yeah.

418
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,640
But I mean it would be fun
to watch a couple of times.

419
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,983
Maybe Watch,

420
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,460
I don't know about fun,

421
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,990
but maybe fascinating.

422
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,740
Fascinating.

423
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,910
I think as an art exhibit,

424
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:45,061
you know,

425
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,350
we're talking about art allows weekend,

426
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,390
it'd be great to set up a live exhibit.

427
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:53,250
I've always thought of this where you
have like 10 people 50 feet up and their

428
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:57,720
button naked and they have different
body types and they're sitting on glass

429
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,300
toilets with glass tubes coming down.

430
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,000
And then the exhibit as you
walk around and they all shit,

431
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,760
like that'd be kind of fun.

432
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,720
And they flush it and you see these
glass tubes fill up with shit and come

433
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,583
tumbling down.

434
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,350
And then you do a septic at the bottom,

435
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:16,290
a giant large tank filled
with shit that's all glass.

436
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,720
And you have different
colored hair and you're like,

437
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:18,931
I,

438
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:19,980
this is my creation.

439
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:20,110
I,

440
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,910
this is,

441
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,840
if you wanted to buy this,

442
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:22,800
it's five 15 minutes.

443
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,063
Yeah.

444
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:34,560
Yeah.
