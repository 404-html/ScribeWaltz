1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,050
Hello Freak bitches.
So you now have taken some time off from

2
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,190
fighting because of concussions.
Right.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,670
And tell me about that.
So yeah,

4
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:13,740
it was actually,
I think you were at my last fight.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,750
It was a,
I fought mark the bond,

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,890
you know,
rest in peace.

7
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,680
I remember we talked about the,
yeah,

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,000
what happened to us?
Did they find out what happened to him?

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,890
I didn't know.
A lot of this stuff is coming out is in

10
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,470
Dutch and Dutch newspapers.
And I'm asking all of the Dutch

11
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:27,930
community kind of what's happening and
they don't really know.

12
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:30,570
You hear different things and rumors,
but I don't want to listen to rumors.

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't want to hear it from like a
concrete source.

14
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,270
And we went missing and then they found
his body.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,080
Then they basically found his body.
Yeah.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,610
So why or who knows?
But he was a great,

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,840
Carrie wrote,
he was amazing.

18
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,220
Excellent,
excellent fighter,

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,360
you know?
And uh,

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,730
he was another guy.
But boy,

21
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:47,580
you know,
you look at him,

22
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,730
he looked like a computer programmer.
Yeah.

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,620
You know what I mean?
It's a,

24
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:55,140
it's interesting how it looks.
Can Be so deceiving.

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,910
It's super,
super high level guy.

26
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,710
Yeah.
But that was my last fight.

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,010
And um,
from there was actually a really tough,

28
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:03,930
I never really opened up about it to be
honest with you.

29
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:04,764
And it was,
uh,

30
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,140
a very tough experience.
Um,

31
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:07,951
you know,
you've got to think,

32
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:11,370
I just win the world title and I'm going
home to Canada,

33
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,790
which my concussion was pretty bad where
I shouldn't have even gone on a plane

34
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,470
home.
And next thing you know,

35
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:18,960
I'm at home and just the concussion
concussions got really bad.

36
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:22,560
I had to be hospitalized for a few days
and uh,

37
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,240
I was in a dark room for three weeks.

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,640
Man,
I could not get out of a dark room for

39
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:27,870
three weeks.
I couldn't walk.

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,030
Um,
I guess something with a concussion and

41
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,420
started causing some neurons,
but I'm nervous,

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,430
you know,
nerve damage.

43
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,090
That could be me.
Yeah.

44
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,930
So it can cause some nerve damage.
I have X.

45
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:41,220
I was like in a bed,
man.

46
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:44,130
Couldn't even look out.
I had a little red light on my phone

47
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:46,050
charger was too much.
Really?

48
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,350
It was bad,
man in red light on the phone charger

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,400
would hurt your head.
I couldn't even look at a thing.

50
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,780
So it was at that point,
it was like,

51
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:53,550
man,
it's like I just win this world title.

52
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,460
And it was a really tough time.
And this is actually the first time I've

53
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,520
really opened up about it,
but it was a tough experience and it

54
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:01,080
being in that,
you know,

55
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:05,250
downstate where you're basically in a
dark room for three weeks.

56
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,630
Um,
doctors were just,

57
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,010
you know,
handy me over shit ton of percosets and

58
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,550
oxies to kind of deal with the pain.
And it was,

59
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:13,951
uh,
it was,

60
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:14,940
it was a tough time,
man.

61
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:17,700
And it really,
I think what was the hardest was what

62
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,470
was happening mentally.
I'm sitting there and being like,

63
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,400
man,
I just want a world.

64
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,780
I don't want to get back in there.
I want to,

65
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,940
you know,
do so much in this sport.

66
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:26,190
And my goal was to be a legend in the
sport,

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,510
but,
you know,

68
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:30,630
and then it got to the point I saw my
family and how much it was affecting my

69
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,280
family.
And that's when I decided that,

70
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,600
you know what,
let's put this,

71
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:35,040
uh,
unrest for a little bit.

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,730
So you win the fight and after the fight
is over,

73
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,520
was it immediately that you knew
something was wrong?

74
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,130
It honestly,
I had some adrenaline rush and I did the

75
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,890
post fight press conference.
Everything was fine.

76
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,660
I was just,
when I got back to the hotel room and I

77
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:53,580
was throwing up and couldn't leave my
room and I was surprised that even got

78
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:55,740
on an airplane home,
the doctors in Canada or like,

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,420
how the heck did you get on an airplane
home?

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,310
So it was scary times,
man.

81
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,560
And it took a lot of good mental
strength,

82
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,730
uh,
to get out of it.

83
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,210
And now I'm actually in a,
in a position where I'm super happy and

84
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm loving it.
I got that whole color commentary role

85
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,160
with Gloria,
which has been incredible.

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,900
But you know,
the Pr,

87
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,200
I think the problem was that saturated
fat was demonized.

88
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,930
Well,
it was demonized in a very corrupt way,

89
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,250
which is the,
the,

90
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,740
the recent New York Times article that
was released,

91
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,660
which was a mindblower,
which detailed how the sugar industry

92
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,720
had bribed scientists to release data,
blaming saturated fat for heart disease

93
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:39,520
and obesity and all these issues when it
was in fact sugar that was causing all

94
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:39,790
that.

95
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,440
So they were literally rigging the
system and paying scientists and it was

96
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:49,360
a horrible article because that
propaganda and these lies that they

97
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,430
spread.
I believe it was in the 50s.

98
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,950
Here it is,
how the sugar industry shifted the blame

99
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:57,070
to fat.
And it's if you get a chance and you

100
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:00,370
want to feel sick at what can be done
with money,

101
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,030
watch or read that because it's just,
it's awful.

102
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,000
It is really awful.
And um,

103
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,660
it was an internal sugar industry
document that was discovered by a

104
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:13,270
researcher at the University of
California in San Francisco and it was

105
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,880
published,
it said Monday when this was out,

106
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,040
I believe it was a couple of months ago.
Um,

107
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,580
but it was amazing.
It suggested that five decades of

108
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,740
research into the role of nutrition in
heart disease,

109
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:27,220
including many of today's dietary
recommendations may have been largely

110
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:31,180
shaped by the sugar industry and
propaganda and money.

111
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,510
They spent money to literally bribe
scientists to release false data.

112
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,850
It's horrible.
It's really nasty,

113
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,190
but I mean the thing is not that much
money either.

114
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,360
Here's a cold,
go back to it.

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,360
Here.
They paid three Harvard scientists,

116
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:51,361
the equivalent of $50,000 in today's
dollars to publish in 1967 review of

117
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:53,590
research on sugar,
fat,

118
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,450
and heart disease.
The studies using the review were

119
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:58,990
handpicked by the Sugar Group and the
article which is published in the

120
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,240
prestigious new New England Journal of
medicine,

121
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,470
minimize the link between sugar and
heart health and cast aspirations on the

122
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,140
role of saturated fat.
Even though the influence peddling

123
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,780
revealed and documents dates back to
nearly 50 years.

124
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,010
More recent reports show that the food
industry has continued to influence

125
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,120
nutrition science.

126
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,420
You know,
I'm obviously a big,

127
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,570
easy target for a guy who works the door
here.

128
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,040
He's going to destroy me,
you know,

129
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,720
like of course how the mighty will fall,
but I still think it would be fun

130
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:30,260
anyway.
What does it feel like knowing that you

131
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:32,330
roasted the president of the United
States,

132
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,430
you rose to trump is it is totally,
totally a weird feeling.

133
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,730
And I saw him a couple of weeks ago.
I saw him down in Florida and exchanged

134
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:46,070
pleasantries and I'll let you take your
kid and you were just talking about that

135
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:47,390
on stage.
I saw him,

136
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,420
uh,
in Palm Beach and uh,

137
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,400
his golf course.
You're doing it as golf course.

138
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:55,700
Having lunch.
I always stand your life.

139
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,380
Jeff Ross is,
is like nobody else's.

140
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,320
I follow him on fucking instagram and
like,

141
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,990
Hey,
every night he's in a different city

142
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,150
with a different set of cool people.
Well,

143
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:07,370
when you're a successful man,
you don't have children.

144
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,920
I'm not married.
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

145
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,450
Jesus.
What a life.

146
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,550
Yeah,
you really do have a good life in that

147
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:15,140
regard.
You're free as a bird.

148
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,420
It is cool.
How the fuck have you managed to not get

149
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:20,290
tied down?
I'm ready to get tied down and you're

150
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,190
ready.
I wish I'd say they say that.

151
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,180
Who could?
Who could do that are around us?

152
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,660
That's not true.
I would like to settle down.

153
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,561
Really?
Yeah.

154
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:32,090
I haven't met the right person.
Hmm.

155
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,550
Well,
how come you haven't met the right

156
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,080
person?
You're in a new city every night.

157
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:38,240
You fuck constantly travel.
Maybe.

158
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:40,310
Yeah.
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong way.

159
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,990
Do you think you came close a couple
times?

160
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,630
Do you think you'll have a little jeff
someday?

161
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,150
I really hope so.
Yeah.

162
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,010
50 yeah.
That's all right.

163
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,320
Why?
Because your as bad.

164
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,170
I really think so.
If it tasted,

165
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,480
it's probably better sound.
No,

166
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,050
freak me out.
Don't freak me out.

167
00:07:02,051 --> 00:07:05,110
You already told me that Bruce Lee video
wasn't where he thought.

168
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:07,840
The Bruce Lee video.
Bruce Lee playing ping pong with

169
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:09,110
nunchucks.
He thought that was rude.

170
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,530
How are you serious?
They're round.

171
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:19,430
No checks are brown and blue.
Fuck is back.

172
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,470
Good time it you'd have to time like the
ping pong.

173
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,530
It's not like a paddle.
This like a rigid thing where you can

174
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,200
kind of hit it.
You get the time to swing it a thing?

175
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,440
Well,
he was definitely a bad ass,

176
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,410
no doubt about it,
Huh?

177
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,160
Yeah.
