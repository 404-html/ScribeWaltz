00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,341
Well,

3
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:06,130
what's interesting too is that there's
all these different approaches to

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,510
strength and conditioning,

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,120
and that's one of the reasons why I
wanted to talk to you because one of the

6
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:11,400
things that I'd seen was,

7
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:11,620
um,

8
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,070
Matt working out with you and your guys
and he was doing all kinds of crazy

9
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:15,760
stuff.

10
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,270
Um,

11
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,310
like when you devise a plan,

12
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,630
like for an athlete,

13
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:21,220
like a Matte Brown or someone like that,

14
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:21,730
like,

15
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,511
what do you do?

16
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:25,900
You work with them first to try to figure
out what they're capable of and then

17
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,471
think about like,

18
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:27,520
what their style is.

19
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:27,910
Like.

20
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,110
Obviously you're going
to have a different,

21
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:29,830
uh,

22
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,160
a different need if you're
a striker versus grappler.

23
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:33,941
Well,

24
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:34,631
one thing we did,

25
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:37,300
we tried to get him more to air
condition to do five minute rounds and

26
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,230
recovering in one minute.

27
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,801
When I worked,

28
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,080
everything was five minutes
and minute recovery.

29
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,270
Some guys had went through eight rounds.

30
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,910
A lot of guys there was able to do that.

31
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:46,360
I mean,

32
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,111
pretty good fighters,

33
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:47,291
you know,

34
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:47,860
13,

35
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,880
13 wins and,

36
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:49,320
and,

37
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,760
uh,

38
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:49,930
you know,

39
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,763
pro fights,

40
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,813
stuff like that.

41
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,380
So just word of recovery.

42
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,160
Uh,

43
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,460
I want to maximize the amount of work I
can do it five minutes and then be able

44
00:00:57,461 --> 00:00:59,800
to cover in one minute and
do it again repeatedly.

45
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,500
That's all I ever did work
in five minute intervals.

46
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,130
So did you work with guys that you use
heart rate monitors and like how did you

47
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:06,580
decide that?

48
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,840
Have they ever done any of that?

49
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,830
Really never know.

50
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:11,800
My friend John Sailor is
got Shinnecock Jujitsu.

51
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:16,240
These basically I started almost
really the first MMA school in America.

52
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:16,871
If you think about,

53
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:17,950
cause he was judo,

54
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:18,970
Jujitsu Samba,

55
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,060
but also striking and he started in 1985.

56
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,810
Oh Wow.

57
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,080
And he does everything by heart rate
where we do things by percentages.

58
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:26,440
Uh,

59
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,741
okay.

60
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:27,780
I said we trade by an,

61
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,001
uh,

62
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:28,990
rates of velocity,

63
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,531
speed,

64
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,810
strength training at 75 to 85%.

65
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,400
He would do heart rate's like that.

66
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,810
And like if you and I would grapple,

67
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,480
if we could talk to each
other for a half hour,

68
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:38,350
that'd be optimal.

69
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,270
You know me and you can
talk while we're doing it.

70
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,800
And that's optimal heart rate that,

71
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:42,310
that way.

72
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,660
So he kept track of heart rates,

73
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,420
kind of basically how we do
percentage of one rep Max.

74
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,100
So meaning that it's optimal if you could
still talk while you're doing right,

75
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,341
sure.

76
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,750
Circuitry and optimally you're new.

77
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:54,460
You're not like,

78
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:54,671
you know,

79
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,780
that's how I would be in,

80
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,723
you know,

81
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,800
so,

82
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,850
but if you're gonna fight,

83
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,610
like if you're in a fight and
it's a very high paced fight,

84
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:04,630
it's very likely that you're going to
achieve much higher rates of heart rate

85
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,020
would be much more exhausted.

86
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:06,990
That's right.

87
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,381
But see,

88
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:09,520
that would be up to much
how we train our speed date.

89
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,820
Like today for squatting and
deadlifting is up the mud.

90
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,250
They do a 25 squats at one way and two,

91
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,891
and for speed,

92
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:19,530
strength acceleration and
two and 20 dead lifts.

93
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,360
And then the other days Max effort.

94
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,830
And that's what you're talking about.

95
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:25,020
What you go all out and
around someone's pushing you,

96
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,441
you know,

97
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:26,310
they're trying to take you out,

98
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,180
so you've got to fight back.

99
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:27,821
So,

100
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:28,230
uh,

101
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,460
it would see it always changes.

102
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:30,360
You can't do the same thing.

103
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,280
It's called law of
accommodation few night.

104
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:32,851
Uh,

105
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:35,550
if you and I grappled at
the same rate all the time,

106
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,320
I would actually catch up to you.

107
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,340
You know,

108
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,420
so you'd have to be able to maximize
your potential and run me in the dirt.

109
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,150
So that's why you got to
have two different days.

110
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,630
You know,

111
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,490
you can't just do the same
type of work all the time.

112
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,170
I think that's where a
lot of projects go wrong.

113
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,091
They get word,

114
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:51,120
he paced yourself too much.

115
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,650
You see that before fighters,

116
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,041
you know,

117
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,520
the old fighters cover up and uh,

118
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:55,830
you know,

119
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,270
I,

120
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,940
I watch fights all my life from
Rudolph Roberto Duran and Muhammad,

121
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,980
our lab watched him and I'm sure you're,

122
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,840
you've got to be a big fight fan and
you'd just see how some people get in a

123
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,930
scheduled amount of work per it
and that's when you can beat him.

124
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,900
Take him out like another word.

125
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,360
You know,

126
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,740
I'm going to make you go at my pace,

127
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,910
not you go with my opinion,

128
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,160
I'm going to follow your page.

129
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,490
You'll make you feel mine.

130
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,010
So varying the intensity of the training,

131
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,630
varying how you do your training.

132
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,650
You think that's very important?

133
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,131
Very important.

134
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,060
Hence the change all zone.

135
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,530
So does it have to change all the time
because the body just adapts and gets

136
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,071
efficient.

137
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,904
Right?

138
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,010
As well as ask why the law
of accommodation is you
adapt to a training loader

139
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,853
stimulus.

140
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,940
And if you don't change it,

141
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:34,661
you get no better.

142
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:35,830
You actually go backwards.

143
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,110
So you can actually got to
change these two meters.

144
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,850
Tom Does a lot of stuff of war barrels.

145
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,760
We push where bells around
for half a mile running,

146
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,100
sometimes heavier weight walking.

147
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,750
Um,

148
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,950
get in a belt squat
all it's very grueling.

149
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,020
And then just a maximal strength.

150
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,310
Went to simple things like deadlifts,

151
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,150
good mornings.

152
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,160
We do a lot of stuff holding
the bars in their elbows.

153
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:54,911
Tom Has,

154
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,600
you do a lot of that.

155
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,230
It's almost like,

156
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:56,381
you know,

157
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:56,801
grappling.

158
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,420
Yep.

159
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,253
Humbling.

160
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,680
And then other times,

161
00:03:59,681 --> 00:03:59,861
you know,

162
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:00,910
you got to do quick stuff,

163
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,440
so quicker paced stuff.

164
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,921
So you know,

165
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:03,161
it does.

166
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,680
How fights are they number one pace now,

167
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,600
how do you like create a schedule?

168
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:07,811
Like,

169
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:07,961
say,

170
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,580
if you're working with a guy and you,

171
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:09,901
you,

172
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:10,510
you know,

173
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,470
we don't believe in schedule,

174
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,443
you don't believe in it.

175
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,850
Now,

176
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,601
even my gosh,

177
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,770
I had the strongest gym in the world,

178
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:19,210
spoke about 140 all time world record
at breakfast and Tom can verify at

179
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,160
breakfast in the morning at six o'clock,

180
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:21,910
six 30.

181
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,210
We decide what we're going to do that
day cause she strengths measured in time.

182
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,580
It's not measured in weight.

183
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,230
It's majored in time marrow,

184
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,370
talking about velocities.

185
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,390
And uh,

186
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,970
so we just pick an exercise like for you,

187
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:36,100
if we did a real low box squat,

188
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,080
didn't take longer than
squatting 800 pounds,

189
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,540
you're going to squat a inner band.

190
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,830
You,

191
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,760
you choked me out after a while.

192
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:43,594
I'm going to tap.

193
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,350
All right.

194
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,670
Well if we run after a while,

195
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:47,440
I'm going to run out of watch
it and I'm going to quit.

196
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,640
Say thank for strength.

197
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:49,300
You can know strange,

198
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,990
so long.

199
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,840
So loans you strained at least
at length of time or longer,

200
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,000
you're going to break a
classical lift and squat,

201
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:55,834
bench and deadlift.

202
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:05,790
Yeah.
